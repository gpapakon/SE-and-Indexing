<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention there is provided an 
ethylene based emulsion polymer, which has been treated by 

addition of urea in a suitable amount, at a suitable 
temperature and for a suitable time to reduce free 

formaldehyde. 
The invention finds particular application to polymers 
comprising vinyl acetate and ethylene, but free of methylol 

and N-methylol monomers (which liberate free formaldehyde 
during polymerisation reaction) in which the main source of 

free formaldehyde is the reducing agent sodium formaldehyde 
sulphoxylate. Such polymers are used, eg, as
 binders in 
water based paints.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ethylene based emulsion polymers, is emulsion polymers containing ethylene, and which have residual free formaldehyde (is formaldehyde not bound to other components of the polymer) resulting from the polymerisation process, and concerns the reduction of this free formaldehyde, and the use of the emulsion polymers in water based paints.Formaldehyde is an undesirable by-product present in various emulsion polymers (or polymer latex compositions), generally generated either from reaction of monomers or from sodium formaldehyde sulphoxylate, a reducing agent used in redox polymerisations. Many proposals exist for reduction of free formaldehyde in phenolic resins, using various complexing agents to react with the formaldehyde. Recent patent publications concerning reduction of formaldehyde in emulsion latices have disclosed the use of urea derivatives to reduce the formaldehyde in methylol and N-methylol containing latices: see, e.g., Australian Patent Application 31608/84 and US Patent 5,143,954 (equivalent to EP 488605). Example 1 of the latter document includes data which shows urea is a poor scavenger for formaldehyde in such latices.US 4972013 discloses a binder composition for a joint compound comprising a polyvinyl alcohol-stabilised vinyl acetate/ethylene copolymer emulsion, to which is added polyethoxylated tallow amine and urea, the latter preferably in an amount of 1 to 3 weight % based on emulsion solids. The urea is added to reduce the large viscosity build up upon ageing that is observed from the combination of the emulsion and ethoxylated tallow amine compound.According to the present invention there is provided a method of making an emulsion polymer containing ethylene, comprising adding urea after, or at a late stage during, the polymerisation process in an amount in the range 0.1 to 1.5% on emulsion weight, at a temperature in the range 25 to 80°C and for a suitable time to reduce free formaldehyde, wherein the polymer comprises vinylacetate and ethylene, and is free or methylol and N-methylol monomers.The invention also includes within its scope the resulting emulsion polymer.In a further aspect the present invention provides use of urea to reduce free formaldehyde in an emulsion polymer containing ethylene, by treating the emulsion polymer by addition to urea in an amount in the range 0.1 to 1.5% on emulsion weight, at a temperature in the range 25 to 80°C and for a suitable time to reduce free formaldehyde, and wherein the polymer comprises vinylacetate and
