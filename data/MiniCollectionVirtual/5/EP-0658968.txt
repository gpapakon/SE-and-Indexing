<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a switching regulator,
and more particularly to a d.c. stabilizing power supply of a
high-frequency switching system.Hitherto, for obtaining a d.c. constant voltage from a
commercial power supply, there have been used a variety of
switching regulators. Fig. 10 shows a schematic circuit diagram
of such a conventional switching regulator. An exemplary
regulator shown in the figure includes at a primary side a main
circuit which consists of an a.c. power supply 100, a full-wave
rectifier 102, an input smoothing capacitor 104, a primary
winding of a high-frequency transformer 106, and a high-frequency
semiconductor switching element which is, for example, an FET 108
(a field effect transistor). A gate of the FET 108 is connected
to a gate output terminal of a pulse width modulation (PWM)
control circuit 111. At a secondary side, the regulator includes 
a main circuit which consists of a secondary winding of the high-frequency
transformer 106, a rectifying diode 110, a commutating
fly-wheel diode 112, a smoothing choke coil 114, and an output
smoothing capacitor 116. An output terminal of the main circuit
at the secondary side is connected to an output voltage detecting
resistor 118 and a voltage dividing resistor 120 as well as a load
circuit of a load 122. A divided voltage between the output
voltage detecting resistor 118 and the voltage dividing resistor
120 is connected to one input terminal of the pulse width
modulation control circuit 111.In the switching regulator of this type, the a.c. voltage
supplied from the a.c. power supply 100 is full-wave rectified by
the full-wave rectifier 102 and then smoothed by the input
smoothing capacitor 104, thus causing a d.c. voltage containing
a ripple component shown in Fig. 11(a) to be generated. The d.c.
voltage is switched to a high-frequency pulse voltage by the FET
108, and transformed into a required voltage by the high-frequency
transformer 106. The high-frequency pulse voltage thus
transformed is smoothed through the rectifying diode 110, the
commutating fly-wheel diode 112, the smoothing choke coil 114, 
and the output smoothing capacitor 116, resulting in a d.c.
voltage shown in Fig. 12.If the a.c. input voltage and a load are kept constant,
then the pulse width of the high-frequency pulse voltage is
constant so that a d.c. constant voltage V0 is always applied to
the load. However, since the output voltage V0 is to be changed
with fluctuation of the a.c. input voltage or load, the pulse
width modulation control circuit
