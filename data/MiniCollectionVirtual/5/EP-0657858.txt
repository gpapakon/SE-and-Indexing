<ABSTRACT>
A simulator for training maintenance personnel in the 
diagnosis of faults comprises a number of machine components (7, 9, 

10, 13, 15) arranged so as to reproduce, at least schematically, the 
layout of the equipment on which fault diagnosis is being instructed, 

the machine components being connected actually or schematically to 
simulate the component connections of the actual equipment, and the 

machine components and component connections being provided with test 
probe application points, the simulator further including a number of 

test instruments (16) including test probes which can be selectively 
connected to the test probe application points, the test instruments 

(16) including at least one display (17), and the test instruments, 
test probe application points, and display being linked to a computer 

or other processing unit which is programmed to provide outputs to 
the test instrument display or displays (17) consistent with the 

application of test probes to the selected test probe application 
points and in dependence on the fault to be simulated in the 

equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to training aids and is 
particularly concerned with the provision of apparatus for use in the 
training of field maintenance engineers. Hitherto, in order to provide practical experience to field 
maintenance engineers, particularly in the area of fault diagnosis, 
an example of the equipment concerned has had to be provided for the 
trainee engineer to work on. The provision of such equipment has 
generally caused difficulty, since the equipment must first be 
thoroughly overhauled to ensure that it has no faults, and then the 
specific fault which is to be diagnosed must be artificially applied 
to the equipment in order that the trainee may then diagnose the 
fault. Clearly, in the training of field engineers who are to 
maintain large or expensive pieces of equipment, the provision of an 
example of the equipment solely for training purposes, or the use of 
a working installation for training, is expensive both in terms of 
the hardware and in terms of the labour required firstly to bring the 
hardware up to a 100% fault free condition, and then to apply the 
particular fault concerned for the trainee to detect. The present invention seeks to provide a diagnostic 
simulator for use by trainee personnel, in which the trainee is 
exposed an array of actual or replica machine parts simulating the 
presence of a particular fault, which fault must be detected by the 
action of the trainee in placing diagnostic probes on various of the 
machine parts, or by applying other diagnostic techniques to the 
array of parts. The diagnostic simulator is particularly suited to 
simulating motor vehicle faults, but can be adapted to provide a 
realistic simulator for any piece of machinery, such as a 
motor/generator set, commercial and military vehicles, light 
aircraft, or a sub-system from a larger installation. According to the present invention, a simulator for training 
maintenance personnel in the diagnosis of faults comprises a number 
of machine components arranged so as to reproduce, at least 
schematically, the layout of the equipment on which fault diagnosis  
 
is being instructed, the machine components being connected actually 
or schematically to simulate the component connections of the actual 
equipment, and the machine components and component connections being 
provided with test probe application points, the simulator further 
including a number of test instruments including test probes which 
can be selectively connected to the test probe application points,
