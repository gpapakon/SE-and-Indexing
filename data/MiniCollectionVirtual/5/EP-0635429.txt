<ABSTRACT>
A cigarette packaging machine (10) is provided with 
a mechanism (24) for rejecting defective cigarette packs 

of a two pack stack of cigarette packs. A defective top 
pack (P
T
) of the stack is rejected at a first rejection 
station (28) by a blast of pressurized air or a pusher 

bar (132) and a defective bottom pack (P
B
) of the stack 
is rejected at a second rejection station (30) 

downstream of the first rejection station (28) by a 
movable arm (52) which pivots away from a position 

supporting the stack and then pivots toward the stack to 
strike the bottom pack (P
B
) and eject it from the stack. 
A magazine (58) filled with acceptable packs is located 

downstream of the second rejection station (30) for 
replacing defective packs ejected from the stack.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in 
cigarette packaging machines and methods and more 
particularly to a mechanism and method for rejecting the 
defective pack or packs of a stack of two cigarette 
packs in an intermittently advanced product stream. Conventional cigarette packaging equipment includes 
machinery for overwrapping cigarette packages with an 
overwrap made of either a transparent or metallized 
polymeric film and having a tear tape for tearing open 
the overwrap. One such machine is a Model 4350 Packager 
manufactured by G.D. Societa per Azioni of Bologna, 
Italy and known as the "GD 4350" machine. In this 
machine, each cigarette package of twenty cigarettes is 
individually overwrapped with the polymeric film, heat 
sealed and then placed in stacks of two packs for 
delivery by an intermittent motion or indexing turret 
mechanism to a cigarette cartoner apparatus in which 
five stacks of two packs (ten packs) are inserted into a 
cigarette carton. During the overwrapping process, the 
GD 4350 machine is designed to detect various defects in 
the cigarette packs, such as, for example, crushed 
packages, missing or wrinkled overwraps, defective side 
and end flap seals, missing or misplaced tear tapes and 
the like. Defective packs are rejected in the GD 4350 
machine after the packs have been arranged in the two 
pack stack configuration. The known machine does not 
discriminate between an acceptable pack and a defective 
pack in the two pack stack so that both packs are 
rejected even if only one pack is defective. The result 
of this arrangement is that approximately 25% of all 
rejected packs are acceptable. U.S. Patent No. 5,101,609 discloses the prior art  
 
package rejection mechanism as well as a recent 
improvement to the package inspection system of a GD 
4350 machine in which each two pack stack of cigarettes 
is removed from the product stream for inspection by 
video cameras and is then returned to the product stream 
for conveyance to the cartoner apparatus. Even in the 
improved inspection system, if only one defective pack 
is detected in a two pack stack, both packs of the stack 
are rejected, again resulting in about 25% of the 
rejected packs being acceptable packs. Viewed from one aspect, the invention provides a 
cigarette packaging machine comprising means for 
identifying a defective pack in a two pack stack having 
a top pack and a bottom pack;
 
   first rejection means for rejecting only said 
defective pack disposed as the top pack of said two pack
