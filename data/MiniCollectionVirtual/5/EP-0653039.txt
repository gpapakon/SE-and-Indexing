<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetic radiation source, such as an arc lamp, is located at a point displaced from the optical axis of a concave toroidal reflecting surface. The concave primary reflector focuses the radiation from the source at an off-axis image point that is displaced from the optical axis. The use of a toroidal reflecting surface enhances the collection efficiency into a small target, such as an optical fiber, relative to a spherical reflecting surface by substantially reducing aberrations caused by the off-axis geometry. A second concave reflector is placed opposite to the first reflector to enhance further the total flux collected by a small target.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to systems for collecting and condensing
electromagnetic radiation, particularly a system for providing a high
radiance to a small target such as an optical fiber.Conventional collecting and condensing designs for
electromagnetic radiation emphasize collecting and redirecting the
maximum amount of light from a source of radiation, approximated by
a point source. To produce a small spot size based on these designs
results in a decrease in radiation flux because conventional designs
(i.e., the collection and redirection of the maximum amount of light)
inherently conflict with the goal of concentrating the radiation flux
into the smallest possible spot size when the radiation originates from
conventional incoherent sources. Thus, images of small spot size may
be obtained only by a corresponding decrease in flux density.There are two basic optical designs in common use for
collecting and condensing radiation. The first is a system of condenser 
lenses such as illustrated in Figure 1. Condenser lenses have several
problems which include creation of chromatic and spherical
aberrations, relatively high cost, inherently difficult alignment, and
large amount of space. Ellipsoidal reflectors as shown in Figure 2 are
also used in prior art systems. Their problems also include high cost
and an unavoidable magnification of the image (i.e., a reduction in the
flux density}. Both of these systems tend to emphasize redirection of
the maximum amount of flux from a point source at the expense of the
flux density, as discussed above.U.S. Patent No. 4,757,431, the embodiment of which is
incorporated herein by reference (Figure 3), describes an improved
condensing and collecting system employing an off-axis spherical
concave reflector which enhances the maximum flux illuminating a
small target and the amount of collectable flux density by a small target.
The off-axis spherical concave reflector described in this patent has
certain disadvantages, namely, astigmatism parallel to the direction of
the off-axis displacement and the physical limitations inherent in the
requirement to minimize this distance. The effect of astigmatism is to
decrease the concentrating efficiency of the system and thereby reduce
the flux collected at a target. The requirement to minimize the off-axis
distance between the source and the target (i.e., minimize astigmatic
distortion), imposes limitations on the physical dimensions of a source
and target of the described embodiment. The teachings of the use of a
