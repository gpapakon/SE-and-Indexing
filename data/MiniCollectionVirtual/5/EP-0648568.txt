<ABSTRACT>
A hot air circulation apparatus and method of heating for use in a wave 
soldering machine which heats air from a high-pressure air source and directs it 

at the flux applied to a printed circuit board. The heated and pressurized air 
also circulates air within the wave soldering machine to force the moisture out. 

A plurality of hot air knives are mounted adjacent heaters within the wave 
soldering machine and are coupled to the pressurized air source. The hot air 

knives include a hollow metal cylindrical member which conducts heat from the 
heater, and contain a plurality of orifices which increase the pressure of the air 

and direct the air at the flux.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to soldering and soldering
machines, and more specifically to a hot air circulation
apparatus and method of heating for use in a wave soldering
machine.Wave soldering machines are typically used to solder
components onto printed circuit boards. Such machines employ a
fluxer for applying flux to the solderable surfaces of the
printed circuit boards, preheaters to preheat the printed circuit
boards, and a solder wave to apply liquid solder to the
solderable surfaces.The preferred flux used in wave soldering machines is a
resin flux. However resin fluxes contain environmentally harmful
and flammable volatile organic compounds.An alternative to resin fluxes is a water-based flux, such
as the 970 and 970CTX flux products from Kester Corporation. An
air knife is typically located after the flux tank to remove
excess flux from printed circuit boards and prevent dripping on
preheater surfaces. A warm gentle airflow is required so as not
to blow the flux off the board.The water-based flux is environmentally safe, but when used
in wave soldering machines suffers from the disadvantage that the
water cools the printed circuit board and causes solder balls to
form. Previous attempts at making the water-based flux usable in
wave soldering machines have been unsuccessful.In EP96967, Cooper Industries Inc., a wave soldering device
is provided with a high velocity heated gas stream for removing
excess solder from a printed circuit board, but does not address
the problem of removing water from water-based fluxes.It is accordingly an object of the present invention to
provide a hot air circulation apparatus and method for wave
soldering machines which is suitable for use with water based
flux.According to a first aspect of the present invention there
is provided a wave soldering machine comprising conveyer means 
for conveying printed circuit boards past a fluxer and solder - 2
application means, characterized by a hot air circulation
apparatus for drying water-based flux on said printed circuit
boards, said apparatus comprising a pressurized air source; and
means coupled to the pressurized air source for heating the
pressurized air and directing heated air towards the printed
circuit board, said apparatus being located upstream of the
solder application means.According to a second aspect of the present invention there
is provided a method of removing moisture from a water-based flux
on a printed circuit board moving through a wave soldering
machine, comprising the steps of: providing a
