<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an ink jet 
recording apparatus comprising a conveying means (304) for 

a recording medium substantially in a horizontal 
direction, a head holding means (305) for holding a plurality 

of ink jet heads in such a manner that the ink jet 
heads discharge ink downwardly toward the recording 

medium conveyed by the conveying means (304) substantially 
in the horizontal direction, a vertical shifting means 

for shifting the head holding means (2009) substantially in 
a vertical direction, a head recovery means (306) for 

recovering and preventing the non-discharge of ink 
from the plurality of ink jet heads, in a condition 

confronting relation to the plurality of ink jet 
heads, and a horizontal shifting means for shifting 

the head recovery means (306) substantially in a horizontal 
direction into a spatial area provided above the 

recording medium by lifting the head holding means 
substantially in the vertical direction by means 

of the vertical shifting means, so that the head 
recovery means (306) is in confronting relation to the 

plurality of ink jet heads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet 
recording apparatus, and more particularly, it 
relates to an ink jet recording apparatus having 
the function of, for example, a facsimile, copying 
machine or printer, and an ink jet recording 
apparatus used as an output device for a composite 
machine having such functions or a work station. Non-impact recording methods are one of 
effective recording methods in a point that the 
noise generated in the recording operation is so 
low as to be negligible. Among the non-impact 
recording methods, an ink jet recording method 
which permits a high speed recording and which can 
record an image on a plain paper without a specific 
fixing treatment is extremely effective. A recording head used in an ink jet recording 
apparatus generally includes fine liquid discharge 
openings (orifices), liquid passages, energy acting 
portions disposed in the liquid passages, and energy 
generating means acting on the energy acting portions, 
for generating the energy utilized to discharge ink 
from the discharge openings.  
 The recording processes utilizing such energy 
generating means include a recording process using 
electrical/mechanical converters such as piezo-electric 
elements, a recording process using energy 
generating means wherein the electro-magnetic wave 
such as a laser beam is illuminated onto the liquid 
(ink) so that the electro-magnetic wave is absorbed 
by the liquid to heat the latter, thereby discharging 
the liquid as liquid droplets flying toward a 
recording medium, a recording process using energy 
generating means wherein the liquid is heated by 
electrical/thermal converters such as heat generating 
elements having heat generating resistors, thereby 
discharging the liquid, or the like. Among these recording processes, recording 
heads used in an ink jet recording process wherein 
the liquid is discharged by the thermal energy permit 
the recording with high resolving power since the 
liquid discharge openings (orifices) for discharging 
the liquid as recording liquid droplets can be 
arranged with high density in the head. Among them, a recording head using the 
electrical/thermal converters as the energy 
generating means can be easily small-sized as a 
whole, can fully utilize the advantages of the IC 
technique and/or micro-working technique that the 
remarkably been improved in the recent semi-conductor  
 
field, can easily attain the multi-nozzle arrangement 
and high density arrangement since it can easily be 
lengthened and
