<ABSTRACT>
The sealing for flooring joints between two structural units (11, 12) consists of a covering section (2) of preferably equilateral trapezoidal cross-section and, depending on specifications for sealing, the seals (2.4, 2.5), as well as a sealing membrane laid plane-parallel to the floor under the structural units (11, 12), as well as clamping devices (3) that jut into the construction joint (11, 12, 13) and that can be expanded between the walls of the joint, using the clamp screw (6), such that they press against the walls of the construction joint (11, 12) and are anchored there by force locking due to the friction of the clamping device (3) on the walls of the construction joint (11, 12). Although the covering elements are manufactured to a uniform length, their shift-type ends provide for watertight jointure and therefore any length of sealings of the construction joints.
