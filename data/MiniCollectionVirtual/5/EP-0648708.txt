<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a container for storing 
high-viscosity fluids. The container comprises two halves (2,3) 

between which a hat-like diaphragm (10) is provided. An aperture (12) 
for filling and emptying the container is provided on the 

lower side of the container. A compressed-air connection (14) is 
provided on the upper side of the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container filled 
with a high-viscosity fluid such as silicone paste, the container comprising an 
outlet aperture near its lower side. It has so far been common practice to store such 
high-viscosity fluids, for example, silicone paste, in 
containers having a capacity of approximately 200 litres. The 
fluid is present in such containers in a large synthetic resin 
pouch sealed at its lower side by a sealing sheet. In 
addition, a few pouches containing hygroscopic material are 
usually incorporated in the container to prevent moisture from 
contacting the said fluid. After emptying such a container, the pouch in which 
the paste is incorporated, and the sealing sheet remain behind 
as waste material, while comparatively much material adheres 
to said waste material and is also discarded. The processing 
of such waste material is becoming a problem which is more and 
more difficult to solve and only at higher and higher costs. 
Moreover, a rather large quantity of valuable fluid is lost. The use of pouches for viscous and semi-viscous 
products has been described in US-A-4,796,788.  
 It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide a container for storing high-viscosity fluids in 
which the disadvantages inherent in the so far commonly used 
solutions for storing such fluids can be avoided. According to the invention this can be achieved in 
that the container is constructed from two equal parts which 
are connected together near the centre of the container 
according to a plane extending at least substantially perpendicularly 
to a longitudinal axis of the container, one end of a diaphragm 
which can be moved between a first position in which the 
diaphragm substantially engages the inner wall of one 
container half and a second position in which the diaphgragm 
substantially engages the inner wall of the second container 
half, being clamped between the interconnected ends of the container halves, and which container comprises an outlet aperture near its lower side and a connection for providing a pressurised medium between the inner wall of the container and the diaphragm on the side remote from the outlet aperture. "GB-A-2 098 667 describes containers for water. The container described 
in GB-A-2 098 667 is also provided with a diaphragm. When using a container according to the invention, 
an effective and uniform emptying of the container can be 
achieved, also when containers are used which have a 
considerably larger capacity than the

<CLAIMS>
A container filled with a high-viscosity fluid such as silicone 
paste, the container being constructed from two equal container parts (2, 3) 

which are connected together near the centre of the container according to 
a plane (A) extending at least substantially perpendicularly to a longitudinal 

axis (6) of the container, one end of a diaphragm (10) which can be moved 
between a first position in which the diaphragm substantially engages the 

inner wall of one container half and a second position in which the 
diaphragm substantially engages the inner wall of the second container 

half, being clamped between the interconnected ends (4,5) of the two container 
halves, and which container comprises an outlet aperture (12) near its lower 

side and a connection (14) for providing a pressurized medium between the 
inner wall of the container and the diaphragm on the side remote from the 

outlet aperture. 
A container as claimed in claim 1, wherein the container is 
supported on a frame (7) which comprises a framework which has a structure 

which may be compared with a pallet. 
A container as claimed in any of the preceding Claims, 
wherein the container part comprising the outlet aperture is internally 

covered with a coating preventing the sticking of the fluid.
