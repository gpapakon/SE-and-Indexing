<ABSTRACT>
A drain case 4 is disposed between the bottom wall of 
a unit case and the lower end of refrigerant passage pipes 15 

of a stacked type refrigerant evaporator. The drain case 4 is 
W-shape in cross section, and comprising two pieces of outside 

inclined walls 32 contacting the side ends of two pieces of 
tank parts 16 and 17 formed at the lower end side of the 

refrigerant passage pipes 15, a chevron type protruded wall 33 
contacting a recessed part 28 formed at the bottom end of the 

part between the adjacent two pieces of tank parts 16 and 17, 
and inside inclined walls 34 having a drain hole 36. In this 

arrangement, the condensed water flows from the side ends of 
the two pieces of tank parts 16 and 17 and the part between 

the two pieces of tank part 16 and 17 into the lower ends 
thereof reaches the two pieces of outside inclined walls 32 

and protruded wall 33 of the drain case 4 before reaching the 
bottom end of the two pieces of tank parts 16 and 17, and then 

is efficiently drained therefrom. Localized corrosion that 
may occur at the lower end part of refrigerant passage pipes 

is prevented by not allowing the condensed water to stay at 
the lower end side of the refrigerant passage pipes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
cooling unit for air conditioners according to the preamble of claim 1 which coding unit is furnished with a 
drain case suitable for efficiently draining the condensed 
water generated on the surface of a refrigerant evaporator 
housed within a unit case, by way of examples, as shown in Fig. 20-28. As illustrated in FIGS. 20 and 21, there has conventionally 
been an air conditioner which houses a refrigerant 
evaporator 102 within a recessed part 101 of a unit case 100 
serving as a duct for sending the air into a vehicle 
compartment. In this air conditioner, a drain port 103 is 
formed at the bottom wall part of the recessed part 101, which 
drain port 103 being opened under the refrigerant evaporator 
102, to drain the condensed water adhered to the surface of 
the refrigerant evaporator 102 from the unit case 100 to 
outside. On the other hand, as illustrated in FIG. 22, the 
refrigerant evaporator 102 has been composed by stacking a 
plurality of plural pairs of formed plates 106 with which 
refrigerant passage pipes 104 and two pieces of tank parts 105  
 
are integrally formed at the end part side of the refrigerant 
passage pipes 104. A core part 107 of the refrigerant 
evaporator 102 is so composed that fins 108 are disposed 
between the adjacent refrigerant passage pipes 104. The air side heat transmission surface of the 
refrigerant evaporator 102 (the surface to which the condensed 
water adheres) is formed from the surfaces of the fins 108 and 
the surfaces of the refrigerant passage pipes 104. As 
illustrated in FIG. 23, the condensed water adhered to the 
surface of the fins 108 flows along the fins 108 to the side 
of the refrigerant passage pipes 104. On the other hand, as 
illustrated in FIG. 24, a plurality of inclined ribs 109 are 
formed in the protruded state at the inside of the refrigerant 
passage pipes 104 (in the recessed state at the air side heat 
transmission surface) to improve the heat transmission 
efficiency. The condensed water flows along the inclined ribs 
109 to the lower end side of the core part 107. Based on the 
principle of draining the condensed water as described in the 
above, the condensed water adhered to the surfaces of the fins 
108 and refrigerant passage pipes 104 is drained to the lower 
end side of the core part 107. Incidentally, a folded part 
113 prevents the fins 108 from buckling. There are two types of surface treatments for refrigerant 
passage pipes 104 formed by a pair of plates 106 and the 
fins 108; one
