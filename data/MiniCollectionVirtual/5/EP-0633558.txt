<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shoulder rest (1) with clamping devices (3, 4), at least one adjustable clamping device (3, 4) being mounted on the rest plate (2) via a support arm (8, 8a) which is essentially sliding in the longitudinal axis of the rest plate (2) and self-lockingly adjustable, and the support arm (8, 8a) being fixed in its position both by a bearing block (11, 11a) known per se and by an eccentric clamp (12, 12a).

<CLAIMS>
A shoulder support (1) comprising two double-armed 
adjustable clamping devices (3, 4) clampingly holding at two 

opposing points the edge of the stringed instrument (6) to be 
held, arranged on a support plate (2) and equipped with 

threaded pins (7), at least one adjustable clamping device 
(3) or (4) being mounted in a bearing block (11) on the 

support plate (2) via a self-lockingly adjustable support arm 
(8) sliding substantially in the longitudinal axis of the 

support plate (2), this bearing block (11) being arranged, 
together with a fixable clip (12) displaceable on the support 

arm (8), between two bearing eyelets (9, 10), characterized 
in that the clip (12) is constructed as an eccentric clip. 
A shoulder support according to claim 1, characterized 
in that two support arms (8, 8a) are provided, which are each 

provided with a bearing block (11, 11a) and a clamping device 
(12, 12a). 
A shoulder support according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the support arms (8, 8a) are of curved construction 

in the plane of the support plate (2), the curvature of the 
support arm (8) being oriented in opposition to the curvature 

of the support arm (8a). 
A shoulder support according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the bearing eyelets 

(9, 10; 9a, 10a) are bent out from the support plate (2) and 
an abutment plate (16) is inserted into the free space in the 

support plate (2) under the eccentric (14) of the eccentric 
clip.
