<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method of treating a medical condition associated with increased proteolytic activity of Calpain in a mammal. The method includes administering a pharmaceutical composition containing a Calpain inhibitor compound to the mammal in an amount that is pharmacologically effective to treat the condition. The inhibitor is a compound in one of the following groups of compounds: Peptide Keto-Compounds, Substituted Heterocyclic Compounds or Halo-Ketone Peptides. Examples of conditions that can be treated using the methods of the present invention include cardiac muscle tissue damage, cataracts, smooth muscle damage and vasospasm. The present invention also provides a method of inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation and thereby preventing the restenosis of a blood vessel which has been undergone therapeutic angioplasty. This method includes the administration of a calpain inhibitor to the blood vessel during or after the angioplasty procedure. Further, methods of blocking the establishment of the tonically contracted state in smooth muscle and relaxing tonically contracted smooth muscle are disclosed. These methods involve the administration of a calpain inhibitor, thereby reducing or preventing smooth muscle contraction associated with vasospasm and bronchospasm.

<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF CALPAIN INHIBITORS IN THE INHIBITIONAND TREATMENT OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITHINCREASED CALPAIN ACTIVITYBackground of the Invention The present invention relates generally to medical treatments involving the inhibition of calcium-activated proteases, such as Calpain. More specifically, the present invention relates to the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions, coronary disease, circulatory pathology, cataract formation, and other medical conditions associated with calcium-activated protease activity using inhibitors of these proteases.Neural tissues, including brain, are known to possess a large variety of proteases, including at least two calcium-stimulated proteases, termed calpain I and calpain II, which are activated by micromolar and millimolar Ca2+ concentrations, 

respectively. Calpains are a family of calcium activated thiol proteases that are present in many tissues and use a cysteine residue in their catalytic mechanism. Calpain II is the predominant form, but calpain I is found at synapses and is thought to be the form involved in long term potentiation, synaptic plasticity and cell death. Thiol proteases are distinguished from serine proteases, metalloproteases and other proteases by their mechanism of action and by the amino acid residue (cysteine) that participates in substrate attack. Although several thiol proteases are produced by plants, these proteases are not common in mammals, with cathepsin B (a lysosomal enzyme), other cathepsins and the calpains being among the few representatives of this family that have been described in mammals. Calpain I and calpain II are the best described of these, but several other members of the calpain family have been reported.Other Ca2+ -activated thiol proteases may exist, such as those reported by Yoshihara et al, in /. Biol Chem., 265:5809-5815 (1990). The term "Calpain" is used hereinafter to refer to any Ca2+ -activated thiol proteases including the Yoshihara enzyme and calpains I and II.Although Calpains degrade a wide variety of protein substrates, cytoskeletal proteins seem to be particularly susceptible to attack. In at least some cases, the products of the proteolytic digestion of these proteins by Calpain are distinctive and persistent over time. Since cytoskeletal proteins are major components of certain types of cells, this provides a simple method of detecting Calpain activity in cells and tissues.Specifically, the accumulation of the breakdown products ("BDP's") of spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein, has been
