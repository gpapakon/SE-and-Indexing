<DESCRIPTION>
Benzopyran, benzothiopyran and benzofuran derivatives as 5-HT4 antagoni stsThis invention relates to the use of compounds as 5-HT4 receptor antagonists 5 in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, CNS disorders including migraine and/or cardiovascular disorders, and to certain novel compounds having 5-HT4 receptor antagonist activity.European Journal of Pharmacology 146 (1988), 187-188, and Naunyn- 10 Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. (1989) 340:403-410, describe a non classical 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor, now designated the 5-HT4 receptor, and that ICS 205-930, which is also a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, acts as an antagonist at this receptor.15 WO 91/16045 (SmithKline and French Laboratories Limited) describes the use of cardiac 5-HT4 receptor antagonists in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias and stroke.EP-A-501322 (Glaxo Group Limited) describes indole derivatives having 20 5-HT4 antagonist activity.Some 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been disclosed as of potential use in the treatment of certain aspects of irritable bowel syndrome [EP-A-189002 (Sandoz Limited) and EP-A-201165 (Beecham Group p.l.c)].255-HT3 receptor interactions which are of potential use in the treatment of IBS are those associated either with the visceral pain and abnormal perception of sensation aspects of this disease, or they are related to the ability of some 5- HT3 receptor antagonists to cause constipation in volunteers.30Some 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been disclosed as of potential use in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders associated with upper gut motility [EP-A-226266 (Glaxo Group Ltd.) and EP-A-189002 (Sandoz Limited)]. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are also well known antiemetics, such as 35 ondansetron, granisetron and tropisetron [Drugs of the Future 1989, 14 (9) p.875 - F.D. King and G.J. Sanger]. 

EP-A-234872 (Adria), US 4859683 (Rorer) and EP-A-307172 (Lilly) describe 5-HT3 receptor antagonists derived from a benzoic acid nucleus, 2,3- disubstituted by alkyleneoxy.It has now been discovered that certain of the compounds embraced by the general formulae disclosed therein, and related compounds, have 5-HT4 receptor antagonist properties, and are therefore of potential use in the treatment of IBS or atrial arrhythmias and stroke.The compounds of the present invention also have a potential use in the treatment of CNS disorders such as anxiety and/or migraine, in the treatment of upper gut motility disorders and as antiemetics.Accordingly, the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula
