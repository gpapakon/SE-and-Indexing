<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process and a device which are intended for extracting elements in the form of precipitated or co-precipitated paramagnetic "flock particles" contained in liquid effluents which pass through at least one treatment chamber (9) subjected to the action of a high-intensity magnetic field, under the action of magnetisation means (5, 7), in particular of the superconducting-coil type, so as to trap the flock particles in the treatment chamber (9). In this process and this device, the effluents to be treated pass through an extraction matrix (8, 8a, 8b, 8c) arranged in the treatment chamber (9, 9a, 9b, 9c) and rinsing is carried out, during which the inlet of effluents into the treatment chamber (9) is interrupted, and a rinsing solution, of composition suitable for dissolving the flock particles, is let into this treatment chamber, and the "pollution liquid", namely that constituted by the dissolved flock particles and the rinsing liquid, is extracted from the said treatment chamber (9).
