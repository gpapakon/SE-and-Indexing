<ABSTRACT>
The controller is intended to allow the implementation of at least one rule from fuzzy logic. It includes a circuit for determining the global truth rating of the premises of the rule and a circuit for determining the values to be provided as output. The circuit for determining the global truth rating includes a plurality of distance-determining circuits (5) each providing a distance value which is equal to zero when a particular condition of the rule is satisfied exactly, and which is a quadratic or linear function of the difference between the input value and the reference value of this condition. A transformation circuit which receives as input the sum of the distance values for the various conditions delivers a signal representing the truth rating of the premises of the rule.

Fuzzy logic controller permitting the
implementation of at least one behaviour rule, each of

said rules having at least one condition expressed by a
relational operator between an input variable (X) and a

reference value (A), said controller functioning by
attributing to a set of output variables (Y) magnitudes

(Vout) which are determined on the basis of predetermined
values (VA) by weighting each of them by an overall degree

of truth of a rule, said overall degree truth being
determined by combining the degrees of truth of the

different conditions of said rule, said degree of truth of
a condition being equal to 1 when the condition is

strictly verified and equal to 0 when the condition is
considered non-verified, said controller having at least

one determination circuit of said overall degree of truth
(figure 4) and one determination circuit of said

magnitudes of the output variables (figures 8 and 9) and
being characterized in that said determination circuits of

the overall degree of truth comprise:

a plurality of distance determination circuits
(5;105a,105b) which each provide, at the output, a

distance signal, the amplitude of which is zero when said
condition is verified between said input variable (Iin)

and said reference value (IA), and the amplitude of which
is an increasing function of the absolute difference (ΔI)

between said input variable and said reference value when
these two magnitudes (Iin,IA) do not verify said

condition;
a summation circuit by rule (27,36) realising the
sum (Iout) of the amplitudes of said distance signals

obtained for said rule; and
at least one transformation circuit (7;107)
receiving said sum supplied by said summation circuit and

delivering a signal (Iweight) which equals 0 when said sum
is greater than a given threshold value, equals 1 when

said sum is at the minimum and assumes continuously 
increasing values between 0 and 1 when said sum varies

between, respectively, said given threshold value and said
minimum value.

verify said condition.
Controller according to claim 1, characterized in
that the amplitude of said distance signal supplied by

each of said distance determination circuits (5;105a,105b)
