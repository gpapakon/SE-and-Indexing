<ABSTRACT>
On the basis of the inversion-kinematic system of Paul Schatz (DE-C 589 452), the driver elements (1 to 6) used for material displacement are designed in such a way that each driver element engages in a radial indentation (7) of the adjacent element, and thus renders it possible for an inversion-kinematic movement to be achieved by means of driver elements in a more uncomplicated and thus more cost-effective form. Use for material displacement, mixing of substances, compost conversion and as a ship's (marine) propulsion unit.

A device for converting a rotational movement for the purpose of directed displacement of a 
fluid, flowable or pourable substance surrounding the device at least in part, such as for 

example gaseous, liquid, pasty or granulated substances or other substances present in a 
loose form, with a frame 
(m)
 and two rotatably mounted stationary shafts 
(x, y)
 which 
are arranged at a distance from each other on the said frame 
(m)
 and to which are articulated 
the two end portions of a half cube-belt linkage comprising two lateral links 
(o, p)
 
and a central link 
(n)
, wherein the two lateral links 
(o, p)
 are connected to the stationary 
shafts 
(x, y)
 and the central link 
(n)
 by pivot shafts 
(a to f)
 which are successively 
staggered by 90° from one another in each case, and wherein at least two entrainment 

elements are associated with the links 
(o, p, n)
, 
characterized in that
 the central link 
(n)
 
and at least one of the two lateral links 
(o, p)
 of the half cube linkage are constructed in 
the form of flat entrainment elements suitable for displacing flowable or pourable substances 

at least one of two adjacent entrainment elements (1 to 6; 11, 12; 15, 16; 26, 
27
; 28, 29) with respect to the unobstructed movement of the adjacent element has a free 
zone which is directed at right angles towards the pivot shaft 
(a
 to 
g)
 of the adjacent 
element and into which the adjacent element projects in a rotating manner during the 

inversion-kinematic course of movement, in such a way that, when uncomplicated shapes 
of the entrainment elements are used, displacement of the substance over large areas is 

made possible with the substance on adjacent entrainment elements being wiped off in a 
reciprocal manner. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 at least one of two mutually adjacent 
entrainment elements comprises a radial recess (7) as a free zone, which extends 

from the periphery of the said entrainment element to approximately its median axis and 
the width of which corresponds to at least the thickness of the adjacent element projecting 

into the recess. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it comprises two half cube-belt 
linkages in a mirror-inverted arrangement. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the entrainment elements 
(1 to 6; 11, 12 ; 15, 16) are at least approximately in the shape of circular discs.  

 
A device according to Claim 1 for use in a solid pourable medium, preferably for the disintegration 
of material in loose ground and for turning over compost, 
characterized in 
that
 the entrainment elements (26, 27) have a serration 
(Z)
 over part of their periphery. 
A device according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the entrainment elements are made 
spherical and are provided at least in part with serrated turning-over members 
(Z)
 on 
their surface. 
A device according to Claim 1 with only two entrainment elements (11, 12), of which 
one (12) has a radial recess (7) as a free zone into which the other (11) projects, 
characterized 
in that
 an endless transmission device 
(K)
, which is guided over two wheels 

(W3, W4)
 coupled to the drive shafts 
(x, y)
 of an inversion-kinematic articulation system 
(11, 12) is connected to a drive shaft 
(U)
, wherein two turning- over wheels 
(W1, W2)
 
producing a change in the rotational direction of the said wheels 
(W3, W4)
 are additionally 
mounted on a jointed cross-shaft axle (14) in such a way as to compensate the 

fluctuations in velocity of the two contrarotating drive shafts 
(x, y)
 of the articulation 
system caused by the cardanic dislocation of the articulation system. 
A device according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the entrainment element (16) provided 
with the said recess (21) is suspended on a double fork (22), the two double arms 

of which practically rest against the surfaces of the entrainment element (16) and thus act 
as wipers, wherein the two portions of the double fork (22) form an angle α of at most 

120°. 
A device according to Claim 1 for use as a drive for a ship, 
characterized in that
 the 
entrainment elements are constructed as hollow members in order to reduce their weight. 
A device according to Claim 1 for use as a cleaning appliance, 
characterized in that
 the 
entrainment elements are provided with brushes on their periphery.
