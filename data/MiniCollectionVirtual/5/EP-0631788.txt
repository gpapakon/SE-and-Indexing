<ABSTRACT>
Gel-like fragrance composition which comprises an 
aqueous gel comprising an aqueous fluid and a gelling agent 

incorporated an oil-absorbable resin carrying a fragrant 
material. Without unfavourable changes of fragrant 

material, occurring in the preparation of fragrance, such as 
volatile emission, spoilage, discoloration and foreign odour 

development, there is provided a gel-like fragrance 
composition allowing the fragrance selection spectrum to be 

wided, with excellent lasting deodorant effect and fragrant 
balance, and in particular with good durability of the
 
fragrance at latter stages of use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gel-like 
fragrance composition, in particular to such composition 
with good volatilisation-control property. Conventionally, gel-like fragrance compositions have 
been used in order to solidify fragrant fluid materials, to 
control the degree of volatilisation, and to provide a good 
appearance due to mouldability and transparency. Gel-like 
fragrance compositions are roughly divided into two 
categories, i.e. an aqueous gel-like and an oilly gel-like. 
Of the aqueous gel-like, the aroma component-containing oil 
phase is emulsified in a water phase containing natural 
aqueous gelling agents, such as agar and carragennan (JP-A-54-135229) 
and the like, or synthesised gelling agents, such 
as a water-soluble polymer (JP-A-55-81655) and the like. Of 
the oilly gel-like, those prepared in that an aroma 
component is solubilised in an oil phase containing oilly 
gelling agents, such as higher fatty acid soap, in 
particular sodium stearate (US-A-4117110), dibenzylidene 
sorbitol (JP-A-59-77859) and the like; and those in which an 
oil-absorbable resin (EP-A-0 441 512) is employed. Recently, the design of fragrance products has 
become of considerable interest in connection with domestic 
environment equipment and consumers' preferances, and it is 
also seen that many such products are applied to fashionable 
goods. However, for product to be fragrant, it is still 
necessary to select the quality and kind of the aroma as the 
most important features. The development of fragrance bases 
and volatile emission systems aiming at the following 
effects as fragrance is desired: no changes in the constant 
volatile emission; good quality of scent; sufficient 
fragrance strength; and a defined terminating point.  In view of the nature of the goods, it is required 
that the aroma be constant over a long period without 
deterioration. On the other hand, concerning fragrance 
bases of the spray, liquid, solid or gel and the like, seen 
in the current market, the aromatic components are emitted 
by volatilisation starting with the lower boiling point 
components. If the emitted aroma components are not 
compensated for, the tone balance is lost over the time, and 
simultaneously the aroma becomes weak. Accordingly, it was 
impossible to maintain a fixed fragrance tone for a long 
time. In order to achieve a well-balanced volatile 
emission, there is employed the technique of controlling 
changes of the scent by incorporation of solvents with high 
boiling points, so-called fixatives,
