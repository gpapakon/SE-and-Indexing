<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to therapeutically active hydroxamic acid derivatives, to 
processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, 
and to the use of such compounds in medicine. In particular, the compounds are 
inhibitors of the release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) from cells. TNF is a cytokine which is produced initially as a cell-associated 28kD precursor. It 
is released as an active, 17kD form (Jue, D-M et al., (1990) Biochemistry 29:8371-8377), 
which can mediate a large number of deleterious effects in vivo. When 
administered to animals or humans it causes inflammation, fever, cardiovascular 
effects, haemorrhage, coagulation and acute phase responses, similar to those 
seen during acute infections and shock states. Chronic administration can also 
cause cachexia and anorexia. Accumulation of excessive TNF can be lethal. There is considerable evidence from animal model studies that blocking the effects 
of TNF with specific antibodies can be beneficial in acute infections, shock states, 
graft versus host reactions and autoimmune disease. TNF is also an autocrine 
growth factor for some myelomas and lymphomas and can act to inhibit normal 
haematopoiesis in patients with these tumours. Preventing the production or action of TNF is, therefore, predicted to be a potent 
therapeutic strategy for many inflammatory, infectious, immunological or malignant 
diseases. These include, but are not restricted to, septic shock, haemodynamic 
shock and sepsis syndrome (Mathison et al. (1988) J. Clin. Invest. 81:1925-1937; 
Miethke et al. (1992) J. Exp. Med. 175:91-98), post ischaemic reperfusion injury, 
malaria (Grau et al., (1989) Immunol. Rev. 112:49-70); mycobacterial infection 
(Barnes et al. (1992) Infect. Imm. 60:1441-6), meningitis, psoriasis, congestive 
heart failure, fibrotic disease, cachexia, graft rejection, cancer, autoimmune 
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, radiation damage, toxicity 
following administration of immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies such as 
OKT3 or CAMPATH-1 and hyperoxic alveolar injury.  
 Current clinical anti-TNF strategies involve the use of corticosteroids such as 
dexamethasone. and the use of cyclosporin-A or FK506, which are non-specific 
inhibitors of cytokine gene transcription. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as 
pentoxyfilline have been shown to be more specific inhibitors of TNF gene 
transcription (Endres S et al. (1991) Immunol. 72:56-60, Schandene et al. (1992) 
Immunol. 76:30-34, Alegre ML, et al.
