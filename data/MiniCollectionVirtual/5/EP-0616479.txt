<ABSTRACT>
The method relates to reconfiguration of meshed networks for time-division multiplex telecommunications, that is to say a modification of the routing of the signals in order to ensure that they are broadcast as well as possible despite breaks in the network.   In a network including nodes distributed into a loop (N1-N14) and possibly lateral nodes (Na, Nb), when breaks cut the loop into k segments (N14-N4, N5-N8, N9-N13), the method consists in using standby highways (A21-A23), if they exist, to link the segments together and to select k-1 (A21, A22) of these standby highways to reunite the nodes into a network reconfigured by a path without redundancy, that is to say by a path in which the highways are travelled once and only once in each direction. Application to networks for time-division multiplex telecommunications.

Method for the reconfiguration of a meshed network
formed by at least three nodes and four lines, the nodes

having ports, it being possible to allocate quite distinct
priorities to each of the nodes, the network being

designed for the transmission, by the lines, of signals
between the nodes, and each line connecting a port of one

of the nodes to a port of another of the nodes,
characterised in that each line has a primary link and a

secondary link, the two links of one and the same line
having opposite directions of signal transmissions, that

transmission in the network is carried out under the
control of one of the nodes known as the control node, and

that since the network is a network in which the nodes
have at most three ports, 
n
 of the nodes and 
n
 of the
lines, where 
n
 is greater than 2, so-called main nodes
(N1-N14) and main lines (A1-A14) are disposed in a main

loop, and 
m
 of the lines, where 
m
 is a positive integer at
most equal to 
n
/2, form standby lines (A21-A23) not used
when the network is operating normally, between nodes of

the main loop, said method consisting, when main lines are
defective, in determining whether there are at least two

sections (N14-N4, N5-N8, N9-N13) constituted by non-defective
parts of the main loop, each limited by two of

the defective main lines, determining whether there is a
group formed by 
k
 of the sections, where 
k
 is an integer
greater than 1, which may be connected to one another by

means of 
k
-1 of the standby lines, and in creating a
reconfigured network by determining, in the group, a

single path using the 
k
 sections of the group and said 
k
-1
standby lines (A21, A22), this single path passing once

and no more than once through each of the primary links
and secondary links of each of the 
k
 sections of the group
and of each of said 
k
-1 standby lines. 
Method of reconfiguration according to claim 1,
characterised in that it consists in performing a search,

in the sections of the group, for nodes (N1, N3, N8, N12)
able to take the direction of the reconfigured network,

and if there are any, in selecting the node with the
highest priority (N12).
Method of reconfiguration according to claim 1,
characterised in that it consists in performing a search

in the group, section by section (N14-N4, N5-N8, N9-N13),
for a node with the highest priority capable of taking the

direction of the reconfigured network, and making
comparisons, through the standby lines (A21-A23), between

the highest priorities of the different sections in order
to enable the selection of the node with the highest

priority of the group (N12), deleting all but one of the
lines that terminate at one and the same section and via

which one and the same priority value arrives for
comparison.
Method of configuration according to claim 3,
characterised in that it consists, in each section, in

circulating a token (J1, J2, J3) constituted by a message
in which the nodes can write their address in the network

and their priority when they are traversed by said token,
said record being made by replacing a record already made

in the token by a preceding node but only taking place if
the priority of the traversed node is higher than that

indicated by the record already made in the token.
Method of reconfiguration according to claim 4,
characterised in that it consists in putting one of the

nodes into a state of transparency as soon as it appears
that said node is not capable of taking the direction of

the reconfigurated network, either because it is not a
candidate for said direction or because of its position in

the network to be reconfigured, this putting of said node 
into a state of transparency consisting, as far as the

node is concerned, in not affecting the tokens that
traverse it, and in waiting until a node to take the

direction of the reconfigured network has been found.
