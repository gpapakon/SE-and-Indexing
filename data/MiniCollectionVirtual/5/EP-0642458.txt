<CLAIMS>
Shelf storage system having a storage 
container (L) which has a gripping zone for a handling 

arrangement (A, B) which is formed for the purpose of 
pushing and pulling the storage container (L), wherein 

the gripping zone is provided on at least one face of 
the storage container (L) and has on both sides a notch 

(E) which is formed so that a respective stud (B) of 
the handling device (A, B) can be engaged in a formlocking 

and/or force-locking manner, characterised in 
that each stud (B) has a thickened portion at at least 

one end and in that the notch (E) at the point of 
engagement is narrower than the thickened portion. 
Shelf storage system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that each stud (B) tapers from its 

ends towards the centre.

preceding claims, characterised in that each stud (B) 

has on its upper end a final portion which protrudes 
over the periphery of the stud (B). 
Shelf storage system according to claim 5, 
characterised in that the final portion is formed in 

the shape of a plate. 
Shelf storage system according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the notches (E) 

are made in a plate (P) horizontally provided at the 
upper edge of the face (S) of the storage container 

(L).
