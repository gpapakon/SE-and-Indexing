<ABSTRACT>
New composite-coated flat-rolled steel products and new methods of manufacture in which low-carbon steel (16), as received in cold-reduced continuous strip form is prepared for plating; a corrosion prevention plating (24) is applied, and a polymeric coating with lubricant (26) is applied as a finish surface. The resulting composite-coated steel substrate is cold-rolled (36) to decrease the gage of the coated substrate. Optionally, cold-rolling steps (14) and/or stress relief heat treatment steps (10, 20) may be employed prior to surface treatment. This process provides for tin mill manufacture of composite-coated steel of various weights per unit area, for example, in the range of 35 to about 100 lb/bb, useful in the manufacture of can bodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new manufacturing methods for
new composite-coated flat-rolled steel product.Basic US Patent Application No. 08/047451, from which priority
is claimed, is a continuation in part of copending and co-owned U.S. Patent
Application Serial No. 07/812,567, filed December 20, 1991, and of
copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/926,055 filed August 6, 1992 as
a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/573,366 filed August 27,
1990 (now abandoned), which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent
application Ser. No. 855,694 filed April 25, 1986, now U.S. patent
#4,812,365."Tin mill practice," has encompassed electrolytic plating of tin,
zinc, and chrome/chrome oxide (TFS) on cold-rolled steel "black plate" as
provided to the tin mill. Whether plating tin, zinc or TFS, the plating stage,
prior to the present invention, essentially completed the "tin mill practice"
carried out in commercial steel plants. (See Making, Shaping and Treating of
Steel, 8th Ed., ©1964, pp. 950, 951, U.S. Steel, Pittsburgh, PA, and/or the
10th Ed. ©1985 by AISE, Chapter 36, pp. 1139-1153, printed by Henbeck and
Held, Pittsburgh, PA).Previously, as disclosed in U.S. Patent #4,812,365 (reference
above), flat-rolled steel was coated while at its cold rolling mill finished
thickness gage of up to about 0.31 millimetres (one hundred ten 1b/bb) with
chrome-chrome oxide prior to subsequent coating with organic polymer(s) for
desired fabrication. However, no prior patent or publication discloses a step
of cold rolling thickness gage reduction of flat-rolled steel after such organic
coating as is disclosed below.According to the present invention there is provided a process for
manufacturing composite-coated flat-rolled steel, comprising the steps of: 
providing cold-reduced flat-rolled steel substrate in continuous-strip
form having a gage in the range of about 0.21 to 0.38 millimeters (75 to
135 1b/bb),preparing both planar surfaces of such steel substrate for coating,
characterized by, prior to completion of cold rolling thickness gage reduction,applying a corrosion-prevention plating selected from the group
consisting of an electrolytically-applied polymeric coating primer, a metallic
plating, and a metallic plating in combination with an inorganic surface
passivating treatment, to such steel substrate prepared surfaces.applying an organic polymeric coating material and lubricant as a
