<ABSTRACT>
The feed device comprises a platform (9) intended to receive at least one item of mail (4; 4A, 4B) laid flat on the platform and a plurality of rollers (10) each having a flat (10B). These rollers are mounted rotatably under the platform so as to occupy alternately a first position in which they remain beneath the platform and a second position in which they project above the platform. A sensor (30) of weight is mounted beneath the platform so as to carry the latter, this sensor being sensitive to a vertical displacement of the platform in such a way as to deliver a signal (C) indicative of the load applied thereto when the rollers together occupy the said first position.

<CLAIMS>
A device for feeding mail items to a franking machine, including
a platform (9) adapted to receive at least one mail item (4; 4A, 4B) laid flat

on it and a plurality of rollers (10) each having a flat (10B), said rollers
being mounted to rotate under the platform to occupy alternately a first

position in which they remain below the platform and a second position in
which they project above the platform, 
characterised
 by at least one
weight sensor (30) mounted under the platform to carry it, said sensor

being responsive to vertical displacement of the platform to deliver a
signal (C) indicative of the load applied to it when the rollers are all

substantially in said first position.
Feed device according to claim 1, in which four weight sensors
are disposed under the platform which has a rectangular surface under

each corner of which is one of the weight sensors.
Feed device according to claim 1, in which each sensor is
protected against 
overloading of the platform by an abutment (34)
disposed under the platform.
Feed device according to one of claims 1 to 3, in which each
weight sensor (30) is a strain gauge.
Feed device according to one of claims 1 to 4, in which the
control means (50) are provided which are connected to the weight sensor

for commanding either rotation of the rollers to move a mail item on the
platform to one end of the latter or halting of rotation of the rollers so that

they occupy said first position in order to begin a phase of weighing an
item resting on the platform.
Feed device according to claim 5, in which the control means
(50) command halting of rotation of the rollers in response to a signal

supplied by a photo-electric cell (7) co-operating with a ring (5) rotationally
coupled to the rollers (10).
Feed device according to claim 5, in which the control means
(50) are adapted to operate in the following manner when a stack of mail

items is resting on the platform:

a) to determine the mass of the stack of mail items resting on the platform
in response to the signal supplied by each sensor (30) if the rollers (10)

occupy the first position; 
b) to command rotation of the rollers (10) to separate a first mail item from
the stack of mail items;
c) to command halting of rotation of the rollers (10) when they occupy the
first position and said first mail item has been extracted from the stack;
d) to determine the mass of the stack of mail items resting on the platform
in response to the signal supplied by each sensor (30);
e) to calculate the mass of said first item on the basis of the difference
between the mass determined in step a) and the mass determined in step

d).
Modular franking machine including a feed device (1) according
to one of claims 1 to 7 and a franking module (2) connected to interwork

with the feed device so that the latter feeds it with mail items and
simultaneously supplies it with data indicative of the mass of the mail

items or their franking amount.
