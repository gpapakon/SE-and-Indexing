<ABSTRACT>
A hot-melt ink comprises ionomers and an image-forming agent, the melting point of the ionomers being from about 50  C to about 130  C, the ink exhibiting, in the molten stage, a viscosity from about 5 to about 60 centipoises (cps) at about 90  C to 140  C. A method for ink jet printing comprises application of the ink in the molten state. A hot-melt ink jet composition comprises a solid carrier component, an image-forming composition, and from about 5 to 75 percent, by weight of an emulsifier and is useful for ink jet printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
 I0N0ME BASED HOT-MELT INKSThis invention relates to the field of ink-jet ink compositions, particularly solid inks, which are used in thermal ink-jet printers, typically termed hot melt inks and, more particularly, to a new and improved hot melt ink.Liquid inks have been used in many types of ink-jet printers of which the major categories are "Drop-On-Demand" ink-jet and "Continuous" ink-jet. For Drop-On-Demand ink-jet, ink is normally stored in a reservoir and delivered by capillary action to a nozzle in the print head of the printer. A means exists to force a single drop of ink out of the nozzle whenever it is needed to print a single spot on the printed medium (for example, paper) . For Continuous ink-jet, ink is forced out of the nozzle as a stream, which is broken into regularly spaced droplets by the application of mechanical perturbations. The trajectory of each drop is controlled typically by determining the change on each droplet and subjecting it to electrostatic forces. The drop can be directed either to a catcher for recycling through the main ink system or can be directed to the printed medium to form a printed spot. Most ink-jet inks are liquids at room temperature. Liquid inks present various difficulties; for example, they do not respond the same to different printing media. Typically, liquid ink on office papers will produce a feathered appearance because it penetrates and spreads into the paper following fiber lines. Liquid inks that are designed for minimum feathering still require time to set, which may limit the rate that printed pages are stacked.The print quality usually depends on the type of paper used, which also has an effect on the drying time and on 

waterfastness. Although water-borne inks have been widely used, they exhibit poor waterfastness. Also, in order to prevent the ink from drying in the jet, high concentrations of humectant such as diethylene glycol have been used. This also leads to a long drying (set) time for the print on the medium and poor print quality.Liquid inks without curable additives typically are not useful on nonporous surfaces, such as metal, glass or plastic, because they are too prone to smearing.Further, liquid inks are very sensitive to temperature changes which influence the ink viscosity and interfacial tension, which, in turn, influences the ink interaction with the medium.It is clear from the foregoing that major problems with liquid ink-jet inks are (i) media dependent print quality, (ii) poor reliability, (iii) poor waterfastness, and
