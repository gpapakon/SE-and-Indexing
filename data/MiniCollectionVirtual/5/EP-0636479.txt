<ABSTRACT>
Droplet ejector apparatus (10) having a plurality of 
droplet ejecting ports (26) capable of ejecting 

ink droplets (16) onto a recording medium (18) and 
having a capping structure (12) that 

alleviates debris contamination. The capping structure (12) 
includes a plurality of openings (14), 

some of which allow ejected droplets (16) to pass onto 
the recording medium (18). The capping 

structure (12) is removably spaced above a channel 
plate (24) of the droplet ejector (10) using spacers 

(34) which mate with other openings (14) in the capping 
structure (12) and with indentations (32) 

in the channel plate (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a droplet ejector apparatus, and more particularly to capping
structures which reduce contamination in ink droplet ejecting printers.Various droplet ejecting printer technologies have been or are being developed. One such
technology, acoustic ink printing (AIP), uses focused acoustic energy to eject a marking material
(generically referred to herein as ink) onto a recording medium. For a more detailed
description of acoustic ink printing, reference may be made to U.S.-A-4,308,547, 4,697,195, and
5,028,937, and the citations therein.US-A-5,111,220 describes an accoustic ink jet printhead having
a base comprising an accoustic lens and an overlying plate with an opening
positioned directly above the lens.A concern in AIP printing is keeping debris, such as paper dust, from contaminating the droplet
ejectors and thereby reducing print quality. Contamination may affect the droplet ejectors in
at least three ways. First, debris can disturb the location of the free surface of the ink, thereby
disturbing the very important spatial relationship between the acoustic energy's focal area and
the free surface of the ink. Second, debris can partially or completely block the path between
the ink and the recording medium. Third, debris can disturb the internal flow path of the ink
inside the droplet ejector, preventing replenishment of ejected ink.It is an object of the present invention to alleviate debris contamination of print quality in a
droplet ejecting printer.A droplet ejector in accordance with the present invention includes a base containing a plurality of droplet
ejecting ports capable of ejecting individual ink droplets onto a recording medium. Over the droplet
ejecting ports is a capping structure having a plurality of openings, some of which align with
the droplet ejecting ports. The aligned openings allow ejected ink droplets to pass onto the
recording medium. Other openings align with spacers that retain the capping structure in
place. The spacers maintain a gap between the base and capping structure. The capping
structure beneficially is implemented such that it is removable.The present invention thus provides droplet ejectors having capping structures that alleviate
debris contamination, that can be fabricated at low cost, and that can be implemented such
that removal of the capping structure from the remainder of the droplet ejector is possible.Aspects of the present invention will become apparent as the following description proceeds
and upon reference to the drawings, in

<CLAIMS>
A droplet ejector apparatus for ejecting droplets (16) of a marking material onto a
recording medium (18), comprising:


a base (24) containing a plurality of individual droplet ejectors (26) for ejecting droplets
(16) of a marking material;
characterized by
a capping structure (12) adjacent said base, said capping structure having a plurality of
openings (14), some of which axially align with said individual droplet ejectors to permit

individual droplets ejected from said individual droplet ejectors (26) to pass through said capping structure; and
a plurality of spacers (34) between said capping structure and said base, said spacers
being adapted to mate with said capping structure, and said spacers maintaining the

spatial relationship between said base and said capping structure and maintaining the
alignment of said openings through which droplets are to be ejected with said individual

droplet ejectors.
The droplet ejector apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said capping structure
(12) is removably mounted over said base.
The droplet ejector apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said spacers
(34) are substantially spherical.
The droplet elector apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said spacers
(108) are substantially cylindrical.
The droplet ejector apparatus of any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said spacers
engage in indentations (32) in the base and in openings (14) in the capping structure.
The droplet ejector apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 5, further including
a pressure means (38) for pressuring the gap (36) between said cappings structure and said

base such that debris is blown away from said openings.
A droplet ejector apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein each
droplet ejector is an acoustic droplet ejector comprising:


a substrate (22) having top and bottom surfaces;
a transducer (20) attached to said substrate for converting input electrical energy
into acoustic energy;
