<ABSTRACT>
A metalorganic arsenic source comprising R
3-m
AsH
m
, where 
R is an organic radical selected from the group consisting of 

C
n
H
2n+1
, and C
n
H
2n-1
, where n ranges from 1 to 6, and where m is 1 
or 2, such as tert-butyl arsine (t-BuAsH₂), is useful in 

terminating a silicon surface with arsenic without carbon 
contamination, thereby permitting subsequent growth of high 

quality II-VI films, such as ZnSe. Use of this metalorganic 
arsenic source allows the full potential of the metalorganic 

molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE) deposition technique, which has 
demonstrated superior flux control than that achieved by MBE, 

to be realized in the heteroepitaxy of HgCdTe on silicon 
substrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the deposition of II-VI 
semiconductor films, and, more particularly, to the deposition 
of ternary chalcogenide semiconductor films, such 
as HgCdTe and HgZnTe, onto silicon substrates. Ternary II-VI semiconductor films find use in many infra-red 
(IR) applications, such as in IR focal plane arrays 
(FPAs). Examples of such ternary II-VI semiconductor compounds 
include HgCdTe and HgZnTe, which are also known as 
chalcogenides. The current size of HgCdTe focal plane arrays which 
are fabricated from homoepitaxial material is limited to 
64x64 pixels because of delamination problems with the silicon 
readout to which the FPA is bonded by indium bump 
technology. The delamination problem is a consequence of 
the large thermal expansion mismatch between silicon and 
the CdZnTe substrate on which the active HgCdTe layers are 
grown. Direct growth of HgCdTe on silicon not only accommodates 
this mismatch by forcing the FPA to expand and contract 
with the silicon substrate but allows HgCdTe growth 
on large area high quality substrates which are not available 
for homoepitaxy. Direct growth of HgCdTe on silicon 
is difficult, however, due to the large lattice mismatch  
 
(approximately 20%) and the polar versus nonpolar nature of 
HgCdTe versus silicon. Buffer layers of ZnSe (4% lattice mismatch with silicon) 
and ZnTe (8% lattice mismatch with silicon) can be 
grown to step grade the transition to HgCdTe, but direct 
growth of these materials on silicon also yields poor quality 
or polycrystalline films. Recently, it has been reported that high quality layers 
of ZnSe can be grown on silicon by molecular beam epitaxy 
(MBE) if the silicon substrate is terminated by a layer 
of arsenic atoms; see, e.g., R.D. Bringans et al, Materials 
Research Society Symposium Proceedings, Vol. 242, pp. 
191-202 (1992). It is hypothesized that the function of 
arsenic is to passivate the silicon surface by fully coordinating 
the surface layer as well as providing an initial 
polarization of the surface for subsequent II-VI 
growth. The first demonstration of the MBE growth of ZnTe on 
As-terminated silicon was recently the subject of patent 
application Serial No. 08/043,644, filed April 6, 1993, and 
assigned to the same assignee as the present application. Successful growth of ZnSe on Si terminated with a 
monolayer of As (henceforth referred to as ZnSe//As:Si) 
achieved by MBE, however, does not mean that the same 
approach will be successful in a metalorganic MBE (MOMBE) 
environment.
