<ABSTRACT>
A two-wire transmitter includes a pressure sensor (5; 160) comprising first (11; R9, R10) and second (13; R11, R12) sensing means each having an impedance value which varies with pressure being measured and with a predetermined environmental condition, such as line pressure or temperature. A fixed impedance (CL1, CL2; R13) has an impedance value which is substantially unchanged by variations in the predetermined environmental condition. A switch (208, 210, 212, 214; 234, 238) alternately connects the fixed impedance into operative relation with the first and second sensing means to derive first and second signals which are each functions of pressure being measured and the predetermined environmental condition. A correction circuit (206) processes the first and second signals, such as by a polynomial series or with a lookup table, to derive a corrected pressure signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention involves measuring
pressure, and particularly, to transmission of signals
representative of two variables through a single analog-to-digital
converter with minimum loss of information and
minimum aliasing errors. More particularly, the present
invention relates to correcting the output signal of a
measurement circuit for errors in a differential pressure
signal due to changes in line pressure or temperature on
a differential pressure sensor, and to correcting the
output signal for errors in a line or static pressure
signal due to changes in temperature.Capacitive differential pressure sensors often
include a sensor housing having an inner chamber divided
into two cavities by a deflectable diaphragm. A first
pressure is provided to the first cavity, while a second
pressure is provided to the second cavity. Difference
between the first and second pressures causes the
diaphragm to deflect, the amount of deflection being
based on the amount of the difference in pressure.The diaphragm typically includes a conductive
portion separated from, and aligned with, conductive
portions on the inner walls of the cavities to form first
and second variable capacitors within the first and
second cavities, respectively. As the diaphragm deflects
due to differential pressure, the capacitive values of
the two variable capacitors change. The pressure sensor
is connected to a measurement circuit to provide an
output signal representative of the capacitive values of
the variable capacitors. The output signal provides a
measurement of the differential pressure.However, problems can arise due to nonlinearities
in the capacitive pressure sensor. For 
example, stray capacitances in the system can cause nonlinearities
which must be compensated.Also, errors can result due to changes in line
pressure. Line pressure, also commonly referred to as
static pressure, can be defined in several ways. To
illustrate the different definitions of line pressure,
assume the first and second pressures provided to the
first and second cavities of the capacitive pressure
sensor have values of 2990 psi (PL) and 3000 psi (PH)
creating a differential pressure of 10 psi (3000 psi -
2990 psi). By one definition, line pressure is defined
as the average of PH and PL, or 2995 psi in the example.
Other definitions define line pressure as simply PH or
PL, alone. Regardless of which definition is used for
line pressure, errors in the output signal of the
pressure sensor can result based on variations in line
pressure.The effects of
