<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a new ac electric discharging power supply which is
capable of permitting electric discharge to appear without difficulty

even in the atmosphere of reduced gas pressure or even though undesired
dielectric material should be accidentally adhered to the electrode

surface, and in which power supply the plasma parameters vary hardly
with time.
The signal from master oscillator (1) is divided into a plurality
of divisions by power divider (2), and each power division is controlled

in phase and amplitude by phase-shifters (3) and power amplifiers (4).
Oscillating frequency, phase and amplitude are controlled coordinately

by control (7), and the final voltages appearing at the output terminals
of power amplifiers (5) are applied to electrodes 6, which are arranged

in an electric discharging vessel.
One output terminals of all power transformers (5) are connected
in common, ordinarily in floating condition, thereby permitting

electric discharges to appear between selected electrodes (6).
The phases and amplitudes of different voltages applied to
electrodes (6) may be controlled to be same or appropriate for a

particular application. Also, the shape and arrangement of electrodes
(6) may be so selected as to be most appropriate for a particular

application.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new electric discharging power
supply which is capable of permitting stable electric discharge to
appear effectively in plasma discharge appliances.Generally speaking, the method of producing electric discharge
includes four different electric discharges, that is, dc or ac electric
discharge, high-frequency, static-electricity coupling electric
discharge, high-frequency, inductive magnetic coupling electric
discharge and microwave electric discharge.The feature of each electric discharge is described blow in terms
of discharging condition, power supply structure and other factors.The feature of dc electric discharge is: advantageously plasma
density, plasma temperature and other plasma parameters are stable with
time, and no load matching is required. Accordingly the structure of
power supply can be simplified. Disadvantageously accidental adhesion
of undesired dielectric substance to the electrode surface causes
disappearance of electric discharge. Electric discharge cannot appear
easily at a relatively low gas pressure.The feature of ac electric discharge is: advantageously required
oscillation and amplification of applied voltage can be easily attained
because of its low frequency, and the load matching can be easily
attained, too. Particularly electric discharging power supplies of
commercial frequency (50 or 60 Hz) can be composed of transformers
only, and therefore, power supplies of increased capacity can be easily
built up.Disadvantageously plasma parameters, however, are liable to vary 
with the frequency of power supply, and accidental adhesion of
undesired dielectric substance to the electrode surface causes
disappearance of electric discharge. Electric discharge cannot appear
easily at a relatively low gas pressure, as is the case with the dc
electric discharge.The common feature both of high-frequency, static-electricity
coupling electric discharge and high-frequency, inductive magnetic
coupling electric discharge is: electric discharge cannot be adversely
influenced by undesired dielectric substance even if accidentally
adhered to the electrode surface, and the electric discharge remains
stable. Electric discharge can be initiated even at a relatively low
gas pressure.Disadvantageously plasma parameters, however, are liable to vary
with the frequency of power supply. Required oscillation-and-amplification
and the load matching cost much because of the high
frequency used, and plasma cannot be evenly expanded in a relatively
large space without

A phase-controlled, multi-electrode type of ac electric discharging
power supply characterized in that it comprises:


electric power dividing means for dividing ac power into a
plurality of divisional power quantities;
phase controlling means for controlling the divisional power
quantities in phase;
a plurality of electrodes arranged in an electric discharging
vessel; and
power feeding order setting means for setting the order in which
the electrodes are fed with electric power,

whereby a high-density plasma is produced in the space delimited by the
surrounding electrodes by feeding the electrodes with phase-and-amplitude

controlled power in a predetermined order.
