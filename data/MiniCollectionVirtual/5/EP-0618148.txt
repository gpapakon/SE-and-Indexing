<ABSTRACT>
A package (10) for compressed flexible articles (11) comprising one 
or more unit packages, wherein each unit package comprises m
ore than one 
compressed flexible articles (11), said unit packages being surrounded 

by a covering (19) made from a film of thermoplastic material 
characterised in that each unit package is maintained in its compressed

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaging for compressed, 
flexible articles 
according to the preamble of claim 1, 
especially disposable absorbent products 
such as diapers. In particular the invention aims to reduce 
the overall weight (and cost) of packing materials required 
for compressed, flexible articles, and, furthermore to 
replace some of the plastic packaging with paper packaging, 
which can be more readily recycled. Also, it is possible to 
use a greater proportion of recycled materials in the 
packaging than previously, without compromising the 
appearance of the package.  
 Flexible articles, such as disposable diapers, have been 
compressed prior to packing and shipping for about the last 
5 years. It is intended that the total volume of the 
flexible articles should be greatly reduced prior to sale. 
This allows the consumer to reduce purchase frequency, as 
well as being more economical in use of space. Although, it has been suggested to make the packaging 
material either partly or completely from paper the 
practice has been to use plastic materials. One of the 
disadvantages of this trend, however, has been the need to 
use higher strength packaging materials (eg. plastic sheets 
or foils) in order to maintain the flexible articles in 
their compressed state without tearing the package. EPA 349 050, published on 3rd January, 1990, relates to 
flexible bags filled with compressed flexible articles. 
This application focuses on an improved opening device 
which is able to resist the tearing force of the compressed 
flexible articles without the need for any reinforcing 
material. Although the application says that "the bag can 
be made of any flexible material, like different types of 
plastic film, paper, or any combination of those", it does 
not, however, teach the benefits of a paper inner container 
to resist expansion forces of the compressed articles, in 
combination with a lightweight plastic outer covering. EPA 425 008, published on 2nd May, 1991, discloses a paper 
bag used to compactly pack compressed flexible articles. 
The application states that the polyethylene bags of the 
prior art, when filled with compressed flexible articles 
have certain disadvantages, in particular the poor 
biodegradability of polyethylene and the lack of suitable 
recycling facilities. This problem is solved by the use of 
paper as a more environmentally friendly outer container. 
However there is no suggestion that a paper inner container  
 
could be advantageously combined with a plastic outer 
co

<CLAIMS>
A package (10) for compressed flexible articles (21) comprising one or 
more unit packages (20), wherein each of said unit packages (20) comprises 

more than one of said compressed flexible articles (21), each of said unit 
packages (20) is maintained in its compressed condition by a paper wrapping 

(12) which comprises at least four sides, at least two opposing sides of which 
are disposed parallel to the direction of compression of said flexible articles 

(21),
 
characterised in that
 
said unit packages (20) are surrounded by a covering (19) made from a film 

of thermoplastic material, said package (10) comprising a continuous line of 
weakness (17) defining an opening in said film of thermoplastic material to 

allow access to the units (20) of compressed articles (21) contained within 
said film; and a corresponding opening means in said paper wrapping (12) 

which enables said paper wrapping (12) to be broken open, or partly open, 
and allows said flexible articles (21) to be removed from s
aid package (10). 
A package (10) according to claim 1 wherein said paper wrapping (12) 
consists of a four-sided sleeve. 
A package (10) according to any of the preceding claims wherein said 
paper wrapping (12) of each of said unit packages (20) has an inner surface 

and an outer surface, and is formed from paper having a weight per unit 
area of from 40 grams per square metre to 125 grams per square metre. 
A package (10) according to any of the previous claims wherein said 
paper wrapping (12) of each of said unit packages (20) is made from a 

material having a tensile strength of at least 4 kN per metre, and an 
extensibility (at rupture) of not more than 1.04 times its original length, 

when measured in the machine direction. 
A package (10) according to any of the previous claims in which said 
covering (19) made from a film of thermoplastic material forms the outer  

 
layer of said package (10), said package (10) comprising a front panel (13) 

and a back panel (15) connected to one another by means of a pair of 
opposed end panels (14, 14'), said package having a top panel (18) secured 

about its periphery to said front (13), back (15) and end (14, 14') panels, 
said package (10) further having an open bottom end which can be closed to 

complete said package (10) when filled with said unit packages (20) of said 
compressed flexible articles (21). 
A package (10) according to claim 5 in which said covering (19) made 
from a film of thermoplastic material further comprises a handle (16) and 

said opening means comprising at least one substantially continuous line of 
weakness (17) of said end panel (14) defining a predetermined portion of 

said end panel (14) to be separated from remainder thereof. 
A package (10) according to claim 5 wherein said covering (19) made 
from a film of thermoplastic material is chosen from low density 

polyethylene (LPDE), high density polyethylene (HPDE), polypropylene, 
polyester or combinations, or laminates of these; and which may be either 

pigmented or printed, or a combination of these, or transparent. 
A package (10) according to claim 7 comprising one or more of said 
paper wrappings (12) which are printed on the outer surface and further 

comprising said outer covering (19) made from transparent thermoplastic 
film. 
A method of making a package (10) of compressed flexible articles (21) 
according to any of the previous claims, said method comprising the 

operations of: 

a) compressing one or more stacks (24) of said flexible articles (21); 
b) pre-forming one or more of said paper wrappings (12); 
c) forming a covering (19); 
d) placing said pre-formed paper wrapping directly inside said covering (19), 
e) inserting said compressed stack (24) directly into said preassembled 
paper wrapping (12) and said covering (19).
