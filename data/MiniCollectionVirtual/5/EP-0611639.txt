member (1) defining the boundary of the pattern to be 
produced, a peripheral frame (2) surrounding the partition 

member at a prescribed spacing therefrom and a cover (3) 
for closing the upper ends of the partition member and the 

peripheral frame; at least one feed port (5A) for supplying 
particles into a pattern space (4A) enclosed by the 

partition member; at least one suction port (18A) for 
sucking particles out of the pattern space (4A); at least 

one feed port (5B) for supplying particles into a pattern 
space (4B) between the partition member and the peripheral 

frame; at least one suction port (18B) for sucking 
particles out of the pattern space (4B); charging means 

(7, 9) for supplying particles to at least one of the

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a molding apparatus for
producing patterned shaped articles from various types of
particles and to a method for using the molding apparatus
to produce patterned shaped articles such as patterned
shaped concrete articles, patterned shaped artificial stone
articles, raw products for sintering into patterned shaped
ceramic articles, patterned shaped ceramic articles, shaped
articles having impasto layers, shaped plastic articles,
patterned shaped foodstuffs and the like.The term "particles" used throughout this
specification is defined to include particles, grains and
granules, either alone or in combination with each other.Up to now the only way available for providing a
part of a surface, such as of paving blocks, with a pattern
indicating a crosswalk, a stop sign or other such traffic
control mark or for providing the entire surface of the
blocks with a pattern has been to paint the surface with a
coating material such as paint or to inlay the desired
pattern.Since the patterns painted on a part or all of
the surface of paving blocks are exposed to abrasion from,
for example, the shoes of pedestrians walking on the blocks 
and the tires of vehicles driving over them, they quickly
wear off and have to be redone at frequent intervals.
The amount of labor involved in this work is
considerable. Where the pattern is formed by inlaying,
the work itself is troublesome and very costly.The present invention was accomplished in view of
the foregoing circumstances and has as its object to
provide an apparatus and a method for rapidly producing
patterned shaped articles which do not lose their surface
patterns and do not become unsightly even when exposed
to surface abrasion.Reference is also made to GB - A 2,215,266 which
discloses a moulded object such as a traffic bollard
having a directional arrow moulded flush with the surface
of the bollard.For achieving the aforesaid object, the molding
apparatus for patterned shaped articles according to the
invention comprises a form for molding a shaped article
and suction means for sucking material out of said form,
characterised in that:
the form has a cover for closing the upper end
thereof and a partition member which defines a pattern
space therein; and byone or more feed ports for supplying particles into
the pattern space of the form;charging means connected to said one feed port or
at least one of said feed ports for supplying particles
under pressure into said pattern space using compressed
air; andone or more suction ports, said one

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for molding a patterned shaped article,
comprising:


a form (M) for molding a shaped article and suction
means (8) for sucking material out of said form,

characterised in that:

the form (M) has a cover (3) for closing the upper
end thereof and a partition member which defines a

pattern space (4A) therein; and by
one or more feed ports (5A,5B) for supplying
particles into the pattern space of the form;
charging means (7, 8) connected to said one feed
port or at least one of said feed ports for supplying

particles under pressure into said pattern space using
compressed air; and
one or more suction ports (18A, 18B), said one
suction port or at least one of said suction ports having

suction means (2) connected thereto for removing by
suction the particles inside the pattern space of the

form.
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in
that in said form (M) the partition member (1) defines

the boundary of the pattern to be formed and a peripheral
frame (2) surrounds said partition member at a prescribed

spacing therefrom.
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in
that said form (M) comprises a partition member (1)

defining the boundary of the pattern to be formed.
An apparatus according to any one of Claims 1, 2 and
3, characterised in that said one or more feed ports (5A, 

5B) are formed in said cover (3).
