<ABSTRACT>
Each node (N1) of the network is connected to each of the subscriber stations (P1-1) which are associated with it by a single optical fibre (FP1-1) on two different wavelengths. It is connected to each of some other nodes by a single fibre (FN1-2) at a single wavelength.   In this node, the electrical signals are supplied by two optical receivers (2, 6) and are transmitted by means of amplifiers (8, 10) to a single transmitter (4). A passive directional coupler (22) and a wavelength separator (20) provide the necessary optical connections. Passive optical dividers (24, 26) form two interfaces with the stations and with the other nodes. The invention applies particularly to industrial transmission networks.
