<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
polymerization of conjugated diolefins and more 
particularly to a polymerization process whereby a 
polybutadiene having a high cis-1,4-content is produced 
with a reduction in gel formation. Processes are known for the production of 
polybutadienes wherein a high percentage of the 1,3-butadiene 
units are present in the cis-1,4-configuration. 
The majority of these processes are of 
the continuous type and involve the polymerization of 
1,3-butadiene in an inert liquid polymerization medium 
in the presence of a homogeneous catalyst system 
prepared by the combination of a transition metal salt, 
in particular, a cobalt salt, with an RnAlX3-n aluminum 
compound such as an alkyl aluminum dihalide or a dialkyl 
aluminum monohalide or mixtures thereof. However, there 
is a tendency for gel to be formed in addition to the 
high cis-1,4-polybutadiene. The gel can take the form 
of small suspended particles which have an adverse 
effect on the quality of the high cis-1,4-polybutadiene 
produced or the gel can be of the type that adheres to 
the walls of the vessels containing the polymerization 
mixture and to the heat transfer surfaces thereby 
affecting the heat transfer of the equipment necessary 
for proper control of the reaction. Thus the formation 
of gel in either form is, desirably, to be avoided. Furthermore, with increasing environmental concerns 
over the use of aromatic and halogenated hydrocarbon 
solvents in large scale manufacturing processes, it 
would be advantageous if a catalyst system that does not 
require the use of such solvents could be developed for  
 
use in the polymerization of 1,3-butadiene to high cis-1,4-polybutadiene. In U.S. Patent Number 3,094,514, it is disclosed 
that a high molecular weight polybutadiene with more 
than 90 percent cis-1,4-content is produced by 
polymerizing 1,3-butadiene in a hydrocarbon diluent 
medium in the substantial absence of oxygen at a 
temperature between -25 and 50°C and in the presence of 
a catalyst dissolved in said hydrocarbon medium, the 
catalyst being prepared by combining (1) a substantially 
anhydrous divalent cobalt salt in the amount of at least 
0.001 gram millimol of cobalt per litre of the 
hydrocarbon medium (2) a monoalkyl aluminum dihalide and 
(3) a dialkyl aluminum monohalide, the molar ratio of 
said monoalkyl aluminum halide to said dialkyl aluminum 
halide being in the range of 1:10 to 10:1 and separating 
the polybutadiene which does not contain more than 5 
percent
