<ABSTRACT>
A drive system (30) for a closure device at the casting nozzle of a metallurgical vessel (10) has a piston/cylinder unit (40) which is attached to the said vessel, controls the closure device via a linkage and has a valve lock which is made up of a control valve (55) and of a by-pass valve (55) used for the manual operation of the closure device. According to the invention, the piston/cylinder unit (40) is designed as a synchronised-motion cylinder, the cylinder of which has a part (46) that forms the working chamber (49) for the piston (45) sliding therein and a part (48) which is connected to the abovementioned part and contains the valve block. Part (48) and the piston rod (42') arranged therein are provided with a travel sensor (60) while the piston rod (42) opposite the piston (45) is coupled to the linkage for the movement of the closure member (20). These two parts (46, 48) of the cylinder are furthermore manufactured from aluminium. This and the fact that the said lines and hence the valve lock are fully integrated into the said parts (46, 48) give the considerable advantage over the known solutions that this piston/cylinder unit (40) is very light overall and, furthermore, very compact and, as a result, very small in size.
