Process for the colouring of building materials such 
as concrete or asphalt by inorganic pigment 

granulates, characterized in that inorganic pigments 
are mixed with binders in amounts of 0.1 to 10 wt% 

with formation of a cohesive powder, this cohesive 
powder is subjected to a compacting stage at line 

forces of 0.1 to 15 kN/cm, the flakes of a density of 
0.5 to 3.0 g/cm
3
 formed in the course of this are 
broken down by subsequent crushing in a screen 

granulator into nuclei and powder and these are 
completely pelletized by rerolling on a rotating pan 

or in a rotating drum and mixed with the building 
materials. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the line forces amount to 0.5 to 10 kN/cm. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that iron oxide pigments, titanium 

dioxide pigments, chromic oxide pigments and/or rutile 
mixed phase pigments are used as inorganic pigments. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that water, aqueous solutions of 

salts from the group of phosphates, silicates, 
aluminates, borates and/or aqueous solutions of 

polysaccharides, cellulose ethers and/or oils from 
organic farming, refined paraffin- and/or naphthene-base 

crude oils and/or synthetic oils are used as 
binders. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that organic binders are used in 

amounts of 0.1 to 6 wt%.  

 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that 0.1 to 10 wt% of water is used 

as binder. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that 0.1 to 10 wt% aqueous solutions 

having up to 50 % salts or polysaccharides or 
cellulose ethers are used as binder. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that oils from organic farming or 

technical or synthetic production in an amount of 0.01 
to 6 wt%, preferably 0.1 to 5 wt%, are used as binder. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 4, 6 and 8, 
characterized in that oils with a kinematic viscosity 

of 1.6 to 1500 mm
2
/s at 40 Â°C according to DIN 51 562 
are used as binder. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that mixtures or emulsions of the 

substances according to Claims 3 to 7 are used as 
binder. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the granulates are after-dried.
