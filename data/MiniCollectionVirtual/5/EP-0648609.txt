<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a portable thermal printer (20) 
having a printer housing (21), a printing mechanism and an 

ink ribbon cartridge (24) containing an ink ribbon 
cartridge containing an ink ribbon. The cartridge (24) has 

a cartridge housing (23) and an improved brake for applying 
a slight braking force on a core (C1) of an ink ribbon 

supply roll in the housing. The cartridge (24) is easy to 
load onto the printer (21). The cartridge forms part of 

the printer housing and is latched thereto. The 
cartridge (24) is slid onto the printer (20) and the cartridge 

housing (23) detents into position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an ink ribbon
cartridge for use in a printer as described in the precharacterising
portion of claim 1. Such an ink ribbon
cartridge is known from US-A 5,085,531. This prior art uses a
linkage to control a brake member located within the core.
The brake means is not solely inside the core.US-A 4,944,619 employs a slip clutch mechanism in the
mechanical drive train.The present invention aims to provide an improved,
simplified and less cumbersome ink ribbon cartridge for use
in a printer.An ink ribbon cartridge in accordance with the present
invention is described in claim 1.A preferred embodiment of the claimed ink ribbon
cartridge provides an improved arrangement for coupling an
ink ribbon cartridge into a printer. In a specific
embodiment, the ink ribbon cartridge includes a housing with
first and second housing members spaced apart to provide an
opening. The print head has a line of printing elements and
is mounted on a support. The cartridge is mounted onto the
printer so that the support and the print head enter the
opening between the housing members of the cartridge.It is another preferred feature of the claimed cartridge
is a flexible resilient housing wall within which the ink
ribbon is based. The housing wall deflects resiliently while
the cartridge is being inserted until the housing wall
encounters a recess which causes the cartridge to detent
essentially into its operating position.Preferably, the ink ribbon cartridge forms part of an
improved housing assembly of a printer. In a specific
embodiment, a portion of the cartridge is received in the
printer housing and another portion extends outside the 
printer housing. The print head is mounted on a support and
the cartridge has an opening for receiving the support. The
printer, thus, has a very compact organisation.In a preferred embodiment an improved housing assembly
is provided for a printer in which the printer includes a
printer housing and the ink ribbon cartridge coupled to the
printer housing. In a specific embodiment, the cartridge is
located and latched in its operating position, preferably by
toggle mechanism.Preferably also a thermal printer is provided operable
in both thermal direct and thermal transfer modes, wherein
the ink ribbon cartridge housing is effective for forming a
portion of the guideway for the web to be printed upon and
for providing part of the printer housing during operation in
the thermal direct mode, and wherein the cartridge housing is
effective additionally for 
supplying
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An ink ribbon cartridge for use in a printer having a
platen and a print head cooperable with the platen, the ink

ribbon cartridge comprising a cartridge housing, an ink
ribbon supply roll having a tubular core (C1) onto which an

ink ribbon has been wound, the core having an inner surface,
means within the cartridge housing for mounting a roll of

spent ink ribbon,

characterized in that braking means (143) are disposed solely
within the core (C1) for applying a braking force to the

core, the braking means (143) including a brake member (144),
and the brake member having a frictional outer surface (145)

acting on the inner surface of the core (C1) for applying a
braking force to the core.
An ink ribbon cartridge as defined in claim 1, wherein
the brake member (144) comprises a tubular sleeve.
An ink ribbon cartridge as defined in either claim 1 or
claim 2, wherein the mounting means for the supply roll

includes a stationary shaft (132) within the cartridge
housing (23), and the frictional member is on the shaft.
An ink ribbon cartridge as defined in any one of claims
1 through 3, wherein the brake member (144) is compressed

between the frictional outer surface and the inner surface.
