A method of measuring electric voltages by 
employment of the electrooptical effect which occurs in a 

crystal (1), in which a polarized lightwave (17) is passed 
through the crystal (1) and by means of electrodes (5,6;7,8) 

which run along opposite surfaces of the crystal (1) in 
parallel with the path (21) of the light and are energized 

at a voltage (9;10,11) which is to be measured, the field 
strength in the crystal (1) along the path (21) of the light 

and thereby the refractive index of the crystal (1) is 
altered to correspond with the voltage applied to these 

electrodes (5,6;7,8), and the alteration of the lightwave 
(17) generated by alteration of the refractive index is 

employed as a measure of the voltage applied to the 
electrodes (5,6;7,8), characterized in that the electrodes 

(5,6;7,8) connected to the voltage (9;10,11) which is to be 
measured, are fitted in planes parallel with the plane 

extending through the x- and y-axes of the crystal (1), in 
such a way that with voltage (9;10,11) applied a gradient of 

the electric field strength (E
z
) occurs in the crystal (1) 
along the path (21) of the ligth, directed in the direction 

of the z-axis of the crystal (1) to run across the direction 
of propagation of the lightwave (17), which runs in the 

direction of the x- axis or y-axis of the crystal (1), and a 
gradient of the refractive index (n) thereby occurs, and 

that through the gradient which arises the lightwave (17) is 
deflected in the crystal (1) in the y-direction or the x-direction 

in dependence upon the voltage, and this 
deflection is employed for determination of the voltage to 

be measured, which is applied to the electrodes (5,6;7,8).  
 
A method of determining electric field strengths by

crystal (1), in which a polarized lightwave (17) is passed 
through the crystal (1) and by means of electrodes (5,6;7,8)

at respective potentials (28,29), the field strength in the 
crystal (1) along the path (21) of the light and thereby the 

refractive index of the crystal (1) is altered to correspond 
with the potential difference which is to be measured, 

applied to these electrodes (5,6;7,8), and the alteration of

crystal (1) to run across the direction of propagation of 
the lightwave (17), which runs in the direction of the x-axis 

or y-axis of the crystal (1), and a gradient of the 
refractive index (n) thereby occurs, and that through the 

gradient which arises the lightwave (17) is deflected in the 
crystal (1) in the y-direction or the x-direction in
