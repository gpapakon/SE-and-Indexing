<ABSTRACT>
An arc stabilization arrangement for a discharge lamp having a light 
transmissive arc tube containing a fill of gas excitable to a discharge state 

upon introduction thereto of a drive signal having a predetermined 
frequency associated therewith, includes a modulating arrangement 

effective for providing a modulating signal which is imposed onto the drive 
signal. The modulating signal has a frequency associated therewith which 

approximates the acoustic resonance of the gases within the fill, such 
modulating signal frequency being less than the frequency of the drive 

signal. In one embodiment of the invention the modulating arrangement 
is an amplitude modulating scheme effective such that a modulating 

amplitude of greater than about 5% of the amplitude of the drive signal is 
achieved. In yet a further implementation of the present invention, the 

frequency of the modulating signal is swept about a range of frequencies 
so that a varying acoustic resonance frequency can be encompassed by 

the modulating signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an arrangement for stabilizing the 
discharge arc within an arc discharge lamp by use of a modulation 
scheme using frequencies in the acoustic resonant band. More 
particularly, this invention relates to such an acoustic resonance arc 
stabilizing arrangement that is applicable to any type of discharge lamp 
which utilizes radio frequency energy to excite the discharge arc and 
which is susceptible to arc instability under certain conditions. In a discharge lamp wherein the arc discharge is initiated and/or 
maintained by means of a time varying drive signal such as a radio 
frequency (RF) current signal, there is a risk that under certain conditions, 
such arc discharge could become unstable and wander around the arc 
tube rather than remaining in a stable position as desired. This arc 
wandering or instability can cause the light output to flicker as well as to 
eventually extinguish altogether thus resulting in the need to restrike the 
lamp. This condition can occur in several different types of discharge 
lamps, including high intensity discharge (HID) and microwave excited 
sulfur lamps regardless of whether the lamp is electrodeless or electroded 
or, if in an electrodeless lamp, whether the drive signal is inductively or 
capacitively coupled to the fill within the arc tube. An example of one 
lamp which is susceptible to arc instability under certain conditions is an 
inductively-coupled, electrodeless HID lamp typically comprising an arc 
tube of quartz or other high-temperature light transmissive material in 
which an electrodeless toroidal arc discharge is developed. US Patent  
 
No. 4,810,938 issued to Johnson et al and assigned to the same assignee 
as the present invention illustrates the electrodeless HID lamp which 
utilizes an excitation coil disposed in surrounding relation to a portion of 
the arc tube and which is energized by an RF signal to develop a 
solenoidal field within the arc tube; the solenoidal field is effective for 
generating the above-described toroidal arc discharge. Thereafter, the 
excitation coil acts as a primary winding of a transformer, and the toroidal 
arc discharge, inductively coupled to the primary winding, acts as the 
secondary winding of this transformer. Other examples of further 
developments relating to this type of discharge lamp can be found in US 
Patent Nos. 4,812,702 issued to Anderson, 5,047,692 issued to Borowiec 
et al, 5,140,227 issued to Dakin et al and 5,150,015 issued to Heindl et al, 
all of which are assigned
