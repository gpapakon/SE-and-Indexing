<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides an improved method for
error-corrected near field monitoring of the far field pattern
generated by a Microwave Landing System (MLS) transmitting
antenna. More particularly, the invention relates to a method
of MLS near field signal monitoring which reconstructs the
entire main beam portion of the far field pattern generated by
a scanning phased array antenna, and does so in a fashion
which compensates for near field effects.Field monitors are employed in airport Microwave Landing
Systems to check the accuracy and quality of the signal
radiated by the MLS antenna. For realism, the field monitor
should measure the same guidance beam as would be measured by
an airborne MLS receiver. However, such realism requires that
the monitor antenna be located in the far field of the MLS
antenna, far removed from the distortions encountered in the
near field of the MLS antenna. It is generally recognized
that far field antenna pattern measurements should be
conducted at a minimum distance of 2 D2/λ, where D is the
aperture of the antenna and λ is the wavelength of the
radiated signal, if near field distortions are to be avoided.
If this criterion is followed for a typical MLS antenna where D is 3.657 m, λ = 6.1 cm (D =
12 feet, λ = 0.2 feet), the monitor antenna must be located at
a minimum distance of 439 m (1440 feet) from the MLS antenna.Few airport environments provide an obstacle-free path of
adequate length to permit antenna pattern measurements to be
conducted in the far field. Moreover, the signals received by
the monitor would likely be corrupted by refractions and
reflections from airport installations and from aircraft
movements on the runway. The preferred distance for location
of the monitor antenna is therefore about 46 m (150 feet) from the
MLS antenna, ahead of such obstructions as runway approach 
lights. Clearly, the monitor antenna is then well into the
near field of the MLS antenna and cannot measure the guidance
beam as would a distant airborne receiver.Near field distortion effects occur because the r.f. path
delays between the monitor antenna and radiating elements of
the array at the outer edges of the transmitting antenna
aperture are significantly different from the path delays
between the monitor antenna and radiating elements near the
center of the transmitting antenna aperture. Near field
effects may be overcome by applying certain compensating
factors to the transmitting antenna to cause the guidance beam
to be refocused at the monitor antenna. Such a
