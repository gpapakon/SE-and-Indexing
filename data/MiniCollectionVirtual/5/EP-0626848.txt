<ABSTRACT>
The use of 4-aminopyridine to treat a neurological condition is described. In particular, the present invention relates to the use of 4-aminopyridine to treat spinal cord injured individuals. It has been found that 4-aminopyridine can reduce pain and spasticity in a spinal cord injured individual when given in doses from about 18 to about 30 milligrams intravenously. The results are quite significant due to the high incidence of these problems and the intractable nature of central pain in the spinal cord injured individuals. 4-aminopyridine is also useful in increasing sensory ability and motor control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of 4-aminopyridine
(4-AP) in the treatment of neurological
diseases. In particular, the present invention relates
to the use of 4-aminopyridine in spinal cord injured
individuals to increase motor control and sensory ability
and to reduce chronic pain and spasticity.Neurological deficits resulting from traumatic
injury to the spinal cord are traditionally ascribed to
transection of axons in white matter pathways, which
normally mediate interaction between regions of the
neuraxis above and below the site of direct damage.
Clinical pathological studies of spinal cord injury
confirm that there is extensive loss of white matter,
although the most severe damage usually occurs within
central gray matter (Kakulas and Bedbrook, 1969;
Jellinger, 1976; Kakulas, 1984). Complete transection of
the spinal cord is relatively rare, but the extent of
axonal survival is not usually determined, even in the
small minority of cases where postmortem examination is
performed. The completeness of the lesion is an
important issue, however, since conduction failure in any
surviving pathways may contribute to losses of sensory
and motor function. Experimental studies in animals
(e.g. Eidelberg et al., 1977; Eidelberg et al., 1981a;
Eidelberg et al., 1981b; Blight, 1983a; Blight and
DeCrescito, 1986; Bresnahan et al., 1987; Noble and
Wrathall, 1989; Blight, 1991), and a very few clinical
observations (Noordenbos and Wall, 1976) have shown that
complex neurological functions can be mediated by a small
proportion of surviving axonal pathways. Electrophysiological recordings from isolated spinal
cord have shown chronic failure of action potential
conduction in surviving myelinated axons, following a
blunt contusion injury (Blight, 1983b). Some of this
conduction block can be overcome, at the level of single
nerve fibers, using the drug 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)
(Blight, 1989). Intravenous injection of this compound
in animals with experimental or naturally occurring
spinal cord injuries, produces significant improvements
in electrophysiological (Blight and Gruner, 1987) and
behavioral function (Blight et al., 1991). An initial
study in spinal cord injury patients was organized by Dr.
Keith Hayes, and indicated a potential for modest
therapeutic benefit, mostly at the electrophysiological
level, combined with a lack of serious side effects
(Hayes et at., 1991 and submitted for publication).In accordance with the present invention, a clinical
trial was designed to examine the potential functional
