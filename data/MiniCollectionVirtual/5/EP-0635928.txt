<ABSTRACT>
A motor improved in the torque 
stiffness, and reduced in the resonance 

vibration when the motor rotates. The 
fixed magnetic poles each have two or 

more small teeth which are arranged at 
the same interval as the tooth pitch of the 

rotor. The total number (NS) of small 
teeth of the stators of an asymmetrical 

type is determined by 

NS = 5 x (n0 + n1) 
 
(where n0 is the number of small 

teeth of each of five fixed magnetic poles, 
and n1 is the number of small teeth of 

the other five fixed magnetic poles). The 
stators of asymmetrical type having n1 

small teeth are arranged between the stators 
of asymmetrical type having n0 small teeth. 

The stators of asymmetrical type having 
the n0 small teeth are arranged on the 

side opposite to the stator of asymmetrical 
type having n1 small teeth across the shaft, 

respectively. In the winding wound on 
the asymmetric stator, N and S poles are 

generated. In both full-step and half-step 
modes, the numbers of the N and S poles 

are equal because of the magnetization of 
the poles in each step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
5-phase hybrid stepping motor and drive arrangement.Hybrid stepping motors have been well known for over a
quarter of the century as actuators appropriated for highly
accurate positioning movements. The hybrid stepping motors
are widely used in various machine tools, e.g. with fully
automated production lines, as well as computer related
instruments including printers, plotters, facsimile machines,
and disk drive units.US-A-4 000 452 discloses a 5 phase hybrid stepper
motor which has a rotor an axially magnetised permanent
magnet and two pole caps mounted one on each end of the
permanent magnet. Each pole cap is made of soft magnetic
material and has a plurality ZR of teeth arranged at
eaual intervals on its circumferential surface. The
teeth of the two pole caps are displaced by 1/2 of the
teeth pitch (1/2 TR) from each other. The motor stator
has a plurality of stator segments disposed around the
rotor. Each asymmetrical stator segment has ten fixed
magnetic poles extending radially inwardly, each having
a winding with no taps wound on it and each having four
small teeth arranged at the same pitch as of the teeth
of the rotor. In the main embodiment the total number of
the stator teeth is 40 and the total number of rotor
teeth is 50. A number of different ways are disclosed
for connecting the stator windings together and to a
power supply.European patent application number 93 306 065.9 was
published after the filing of the present application,
but was filed on 30/07/93 claiming a priority date of
31/07/92 from a Japanese application JP 224844/92. Its
content as filed is therefore comprised in the state of
the art pursuant to Article 54(3) and (4) EPC. The application
discloses a multiphase hybrid stepper motor
generally similar to that in US-A-4 000 452 but with an
asmmetrical stator in which the number of pole teeth is
increased by one on alternate poles.For increasing the versatility in use, there is made an
attempt to minimize the step angle of such a hybrid stepping
motor. To this respect, four- and five-phase types of the
stepping motor are now commonly provided.The conventional four- or five-phase stepping motors
however have some disadvantages that torque stiffness is
unstable, that static torque is varied depending on the stop
position, and that the step angle is not at a high accuracy.
It is an object of the present invention to eliminate the
foregoing disadvantages.For achievement of the above object,
a multi-phase hybrid type stepping motor

A multi-phase hybrid type stepping
motor and drive arrangement, wherein the stepping motor has a rotor (5) provided with one or more

permanent magnets (7) magnetized in the axial direction of a
rotary shaft and two pole caps (8), one mounted to

each end of the permanent magnet, each
pole cap (8) being made of a soft magnetic material and having a

plurality (NR) of teeth (6) arranged at equal intervals on the
circumferential surface thereof, the teeth (6) of the two pole

caps (8) being displaced by 1/2 of the teeth pitch (1/2 Tp) from
each other, the motor also having a plurality of stator segments (1) of an asymmetrical

form disposed around the rotor, each asymmetrical
stator segment having ten fixed magnetic poles (S,S') thereof

extending radially inwardly each fixed magnetic
pole (S,S') having a winding (2, P1-P10) wound thereon with no taps and being

provided with two or more small teeth (3) arranged at equal
intervals of the same pitch as of the teeth (6) of the rotor (5),

the total number (NS) of the small teeth (3) of the asymmetrical
stator segment (1) being determined by NS=5x(n0+n1), where n0 is

the number of the small teeth (3) on each of five of the ten
fixed magnetic poles and n1 is the number of the small teeth (3)

on each of the remaining five fixed magnetic poles, n1 being not equal to n0, the
fixed magnetic poles with the n1 small teeth (3) being arranged

alternately with the fixed magnetic poles with the n0 small
teeth (3), the n1 small teeth poles and the n0 small teeth poles

being disposed opposite to each other about the axis of the
rotary shaft, the relationship between the total number (NR) of

the teeth (6) of the rotor (5) and the total number (NS) of the 
small teeth (3) of the stator segment (1) being expressed by

N
S
 â‰¥ 0.8 NR, the
difference between NR and NS being calculated from NR-NS=K(S0-S1)+10(S1-1+B)

where K is an integer from 2 to 5, S0
and S1 are smallest possible integers and may be equal, and B

is a fraction of 1 so that 10B (ten times B) is always an
integer, the ten stator windings (P1-P10) on their respective fixed

magnetic poles being coupled to one another in the
order of P1, P6, P2, P7, P3, P8, P4, P9, P5, and P10,

where the stator windings are numbered P1 to P10 in a circular manner around the stator,
five

terminals being disposed between P1 and P10, P6 and P2, P7 and P3,
P8 and P4, and P9 and P5 respectively, whereby

the ten fixed magnetic poles (S,S') are polarised via the five terminals at each step of the rotating
movement, such that North and South poles of the same number are generated.
