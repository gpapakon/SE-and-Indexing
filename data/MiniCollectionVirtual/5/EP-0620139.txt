<ABSTRACT>
A reaction canister for a vehicle occupant 
inflatable restraint system includes an integral extruded 

aluminium body part (100) including opposite side walls 
(110,112) and an apertured inflator chamber (106). End 

closures comprising a plate and a base which extends 
through the plate to engage an inner surface of the 

inflator chamber (106) are connected to each end of the 
body part (100) by screws which engage channel shaped 

preparations in the body part (100). Attachment sleeves 
(142) are provided for retaining an air bag (134) and a 

diffuser device (140) in place. Thermally conductive material 
such as aluminium wool (151) may be located in gas cooling 

cavities (150) provided with rearwardly facing vent holes 
(149). A protective cover (154) and canister mounting 

portions (184A,184B) may also be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to inflatable passive
restraint systems such as used in motor vehicles to restrain the
movement of a seated occupant during a collision. One aspect of
the invention is more particularly directed to an improvement in
the design of an air bag module used in such restraint systems to
minimize deformation of the module and possible damage to the
dashboard and/or instrument panel of a vehicle with the deployment
of the air bag. Such improvement is in the structure internal to
the module for a) housing and positioning the inflator and the air
bag and b) directing the inflating gas flow or jet for best
deployment of the air bag.In another aspect, the invention more particularly relates to
an improvement in the structure used in such systems for housing a
gas generation material and an inflatable bag to further reduce the
weight of the assembly and to permit the more effective and
economical incorporation therein of various design features.Some terminology herein is used for convenience in reference
only and is not intended to be limiting. The words "forwardly" and
"rearwardly" refer to the normal forward and reverse directions of
travel of the vehicle to which a passenger passive restraint module
is attached. The phrase "thrust neutral" refers to the production 
by an inflator of zero thrust when initiated as, for example,
during a deployment event or accidentally such as during shipping,
storage, or handling thereof. That is to say, the gas discharge
openings in the inflator are so positioned that the gas is
discharged in opposing directions whereby there are no resulting
forces tending to cause physical movement of the inflator. Hence,
the inflator will expend the energy generated thereby, generally in
place.The state of the prior art is indicated by the following U.S.
patents:
