<ABSTRACT>
Nucleic acid sequences coding for the chondroitinase ABC gene and 
isolated chondroitinase ABC protein produced in a host cell transformed with 

a nucleic acid vector directing the expression of a nucleotide sequence coding 
for chondroitinase ABC protein are described. Chondroitinase ABC prepared 

by chemical synthesis is also described. Monoclonal and polyclonal 
antibodies which are specifically reactive with chondroitinase ABC protein 

are disclosed. The isolated chondroitinase ABC can be used in methods of 
treating intervertebral disc displacement, promoting neurite regeneration, and 

detecting galactosaminoglycans.

<DESCRIPTION>
Chondroitin lyase (EC 4.2.2.4) or chondroitinase ABC is an enzyme
which catalyzes the depolymerization of chondroitin sulfate. Through β-elimination
of 1,4 hexosaminidic bonds, chondroitinase ABC degrades
chondroitin, chondroitin 4-sulfate (chondroitin A sulfate), dermatan sulfate
(chondroitin B sulfate), chondroitin 6-sulfate (chondroitin C sulfate) and
hyaluronate to the respective unsaturated disaccharides (Δdi-OS for
chondroitin, Δdi-4S for chondroitin A sulfate, Δdi-4-6S for chondroitin B
sulfate and Δdi-6S for chondroitin C sulfate, respectively). The enzyme has
been isolated in various strains of bacteria (Neuberg, C. et al., (1914)
Biochem. Z.67: 82-89) (Neuberg, C. et al. (1931) Biochem. Z.234: 345-346;
Yamagata, T. et al., (1968) J. Biol. Chem. 243: 1523-1535) including Proteus
vulgaris (Yamagata, T. et al. (1968) J.Biol. Chem. 243: 1523-1535;
Thurston, C.F. (1974) J. Gen. Microbiol. 80:515-522; Sato N. et al, (1986)
Agric. Biol. Chem, 50: 1057-1059; Sato N. et al, (1986) Biotechnol.Bioeng.
28: 1707-1712; Sato, N. et al. (1986) J. Ferment. Technol,64: 155-159).Chondroitin sulfate consists of alternating β 1-3 glucuronidic and β 1-4
N-acetylgalactosaminidic bonds, and is sulfated at either C-4 or C-6 of the
N-acetylgalactosamine pyranose. Chondroitin sulfate is known to be widely
distributed in mammalian tissue, such as in skin, cornea, bone and especially
in cartilage. Thus, chondroitinase ABC has been used as an experimental
reagent for the determination or quantitation of total amount of
galactosaminoglycans in the field of orthopedic surgery (Linker, A. et al.
(1960) J. Biol. Chem.235: 3061-3065; Saito, H. et al, (1968) J. Biol. Chem.
243: 1536-1542; Pettipher, E. R. et al, (1989) Arthritis Rheum.32: 601-607;
Caterson, B. et al. (1990) J. Cell Science97: 411-417; and Seibel, M. J. et al,
(1992) Arch. Biochem. Biophys.296: 410-418).Recently, chondroitinase ABC has been reported to be a potential
reagent for chemonucleolysis, an established treatment for intervertebral disc
displacement (Kato, F. et al. (1990) Clin. Orthop. 253: 301-308; Henderson,
N. et al, (1991) Spine16: 203-209). However, for the utilization of 
chondroitinase ABC as a clinical reagent, there are many problems to be overcome.
For example, the preparation of chondroitinase ABC from P. vulgaris require
tedious and intricate procedures, since the cellular content of the enzyme is low.EP 0355 831 A2 describes a method of purification of glycoseaminoglycan
degrading enzymes, for example of chondroitinase ABC from P. vulgaris
