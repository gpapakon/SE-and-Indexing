<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a process for the continuous production of cyclindrical rods (24) with at least one and preferably a plurality of internal helical channels (26) of predetermined cross-section uniformly distributed around the periphery. This process is used especially in the production of a sintered metal or ceramic blank in which the plastic compound forming the blank is pressed out of a nozzle mouth (14), with the compound (12) flowing along the axis (44) of the helically twisted pin (40, 42) journal secured on a nozzle mandrel. To simplify the process and eliminate as far as possible the dependence of the result of extrusion on the extrusion process parameters, there is a rotatable cooling channel former in the nozzle aperture having at least one helically pretwisted pin (40, 42) rigidly attached to a shaft (30) at least at the securing point, thus being dimensionally stable. The helical pretwist exactly corresponds to the shape of the helix of the internal channels (26) to be formed in the blank. Thus a constant rotary impulse defined by the pitch of the helix is imposed on at least one pin (40, 42) by the plastic compound (12) flowing along its axis (44) essentially over its entire length, with the result that the compound (12) cannot be plastically deformed in the nozzle mouth (26).
