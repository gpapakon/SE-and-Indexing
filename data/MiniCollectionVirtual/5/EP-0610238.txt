<CLAIMS>
A cup-seal non-return valve (1) for pressure-fluid-operated 
piston assemblies, which is manufactured in 

one piece of elastomeric material, including a cylindrical 
inner wall (14) and a circumferential sealing lip (13) 

connected to the inner wall, which form together a profile 
of V-type configuration,
characterized
 in that several radial supporting 
walls (15) made of the same material are arranged 

between the inner wall (14) and the sealing lip (13) 
spaced from each other such as to permit at least in part 

lifting of the sealing lip (13) in the direction of the 
inner wall (14) during pressure increase from the closed 

end of the V-shaped profile. 
A cup-seal non-return valve (1) as claimed in 
claim 1,
characterized
 in that exactly three 
supporting walls (15) are arranged spread over the 

periphery. 
A cup-seal non-return valve (1) as claimed in 
claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized
 in that the supporting walls 
(15) are one and a half to three times as thick as the 

sealing lip (13). 
A cup-seal non-return valve (1) as claimed in any 
one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the cylindrical inner  
 

wall (14), at the open end of the V-profile, projects 
beyond the sealing lip (13) and the supporting walls (15). 
The use of a cup-seal non-return valve (1) as 
claimed in any one of the preceding claims in a pressure-reducing 

valve (2).
