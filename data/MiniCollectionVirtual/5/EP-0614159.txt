<ABSTRACT>
Security protection is accomplished in an IC card by achieving security protection of data at an item level, allowing a high 

speed access, and preventing illegal use. The IC card includes means (12) for managing service-wise an access level value allotted 
to each data item, means (13) for retrieving a data item designated by access level value information from outside by looking up a 

management access level value designated by service kind information from outside, and means (11) for gaining access collectively 
to the data item values retrieved. The IC card further includes means (23) for initiating time count processing from an initial 

value whenever a normal access processing is completed, means (24) for judging whether or not data is greater than a time limit 
value of time count graphic definition, and means (25) for reporting an error occurrence to outside when a time-over state of the 

time count value is judged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an IC card and,
particularly, to an improved novel IC card which enables
not only high-speed access but also realizing the data
security at an item level as well as to an IC card which
realizes the data security by preventing unauthorized
access.Use of IC cards becomes popular as the information
technologies are developed. Since important personal
data are stored in the IC cards, it is necessary to
provide IC cards the functions which do not permit
unauthorized access to the data of individual persons.Fig. 1 shows a method of making access to an IC card
that has heretofore been proposed. Referring to the IC
card 1 of Fig. 1, PIN which is a personal identification
number of a card owner, a key which is a password formed
by the terminal equipment, a file name at the destination
of access, and access right are input to the IC card in
compliance with a program in the terminal equipment in
which the IC card is inserted. Access is permitted to a
designated file data when the PIN that is input is in
agreement with a PIN key that has been set in a file at a
destination of access, when a key that is input is in
agreement with a key that has been set in the file at the
destination of access, and when access right that is
input is in agreement with access right that has been set
in the file at the destination of access. The file data
to which access is permitted comprises a plurality of
data items as shown in Fig. 2.Here, the access right stands for such kinds of
right as right for reading the IC card, right for writing
on the IC card and right for reading and writing on the
IC card. The "Item No." in Fig. 2 may not often be 
stored as data in the file data and, when addresses have
been determined for each of the data, the "Name of Data
Item" in Fig. 2 may not often be stored as data.According to such an access method, protection of
secrecy of data is realized with the file data as a unit
arousing a problem in that access can be obtained to data
items which have not really been aimed at by the program.
That is, referring to the example of Fig. 2, it becomes
possible to make access to the data item "OFFICE" in a
file even though the program is not really making access
to this data item. Thus, the secrecy of data is not
protected.To cope with this problem, the present applicant has
previously filed a patent application entitled "SYSTEM
FOR PERMITTING ACCESS TO DATA FIELD AREA IN IC CARD FOR
MULTIPLE SERVICES" (see Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 63-73348).In the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An IC card for managing item values of a plurality of data items utilized for
single or plurality services, comprising:


managing means (12) for managing, depending upon the services, access level

values and access rights allocated for the data items;
retrieval means (13) which, when a kind-of-service data and an access level
value data are given as an access code from an external unit, makes reference to the

management data of said managing means (12) designated by said kind-of-service
data, and retrieves data items designated by said access level value data on condition

of having an access right; and
access means (11) which makes a batchwise access to the item values of the
data items retrieved by said retrieval means (13).
An IC card according to claim 1, wherein the retrieval means (13) retrieves data
items of access level values smaller than an access level value given from an external

unit.
An IC card according to claim 1, wherein the retrieval means (13) retrieves data
items of access level values larger than an access level value given from an external

unit.
An IC card according to claim 1, wherein the managing means (12) manages,
depending upon the services, the specific access level values that are common for

said plurality of data items utilized for single or plurality services and the specific
access level values at destinations of link allocated to said data items.
An IC card according to claim 4, wherein the retrieval means (13) retrieves data
items of access level values smaller than an access level value given from an external

unit.
An IC card according to claim 4, wherein the retrieval means (13) retrieves data
items of access level values larger than an access level value given from an external

unit.
