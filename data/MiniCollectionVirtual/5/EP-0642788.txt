<CLAIMS>
A drug in tablet form which exhibits delayed release of an active ingredient, and
which contains at least one moisture-insensitive, physiologically compatible salt of

tramadol as an active ingredient and at least one cellulose ether and/or cellulose
ester, which has a viscosity between 3000 and 150,000 mPas in a 2 % by weight

aqueous solution at 20°C, as a pharmaceutically acceptable matrix former.
A drug according to claim 1, characterised in that it contains at least one cellulose
ether and/or cellulose ester which has a viscosity between 10,000 and 150,000 mPas

in a 2 % by weight aqueous solution at 20°C as a pharmaceutically acceptable
matrix former.
A drug according to one or both of claims 1 to 2, characterised in that it contains at
least one substance selected from the group comprising methylhydroxypropyl

celluloses, hydroxyethyl celluloses, hydroxypropyl celluloses, methyl celluloses,
ethyl celluloses and carboxymethyl celluloses as a pharmaceutically acceptable

matrix former.
A drug according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it contains at

least one substance selected from the group comprising methylhydroxypropyl
celluloses, hydroxyethyl celluloses and hydroxypropyl celluloses as a

pharmaceutically acceptable matrix former.
A drug according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the content
of delayed-release active ingredient is between 10 and 85 % by weight and the

content of pharmaceutically acceptable matrix former is between 10 and 40 % by
weight.
A drug according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the content
of delayed-release active ingredient is between 25 and 70 % by weight and the 

content of pharmaceutically acceptable matrix former is between 10 and 40 % by
weight.
