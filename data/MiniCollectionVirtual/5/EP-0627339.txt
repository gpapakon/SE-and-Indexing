<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a dual position child restraint for 
use on a motor vehicle seat in two different position. The 

child restraint has a number of longitudinal stiffening ribs 
(14) that extend across the rear surface (11, 12) of the 

child restraint seat (10). The seat comprises a back portion 
(11) and a seat portion (12) where in a first position of use 

the back support (11) is in a substantially reclined 
position, and in a second position of use the back use 

portion (11) is in a substantially vertical position. The 
invention is characterised by the use of a base support (17) 

which is secured to the child restraint (10) and arranged to 
distribute load over a substantially large surface area to 

prevent damage to the vehicle seat upon which the child 
restraint (10) is placed. The base support (17) is arranged 

to be secured to the child restraint (10) in at least two 
positions so that it can support the child restraint (10) on 

the vehicle seat in either of the two positions of use. The 
invention allows a simplified moulding process while at the 

same time allowing the child restraint (10) to be used in two 
different positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a child restraint, and in 
particular to a child restraint that is capable of use in two 
positions. The use of child restraints in motor vehicles is well-known. 
Depending on the age of the child, various types of 
restraints are used. For young infants from birth to the age 
of six months, the restraint normally comprises a cradle 
device which is anchored to a seat such that the child or 
infant's back is facing towards the direction of movement. 
These restraints normally provide an inclined surface for 
support of the back which prevents forward motion of the 
infant during a collision. In addition, some form of 
releasable belt is normally fastened around the infant to 
assist in keeping the infant within the cradle. When an infant grows and increases in size, a different type 
of restraint is required. At the age of six months and over, 
the infant is quite capable of sitting upright. Therefore a 
child restraint or booster seat in which the infant sits 
upright and faces forward is used. A safety harness is used 
within the seat. In both instances, the cradle for an infant from birth to six 
months and the child restraint for six months and over are 
secured to the seat of a motor vehicle with existing vehicle 
lap sash seat belts. Additional securing harnesses can be 
attached between the booster seat or cradle and the motor 
vehicle at a point directly behind the vehicle seat. The 
arrangement of harnesses and seat belts normally provide 
secure attachment of the restraint to the vehicle seat. One obvious disadvantage is that as a child grows, it is 
necessary to discard the earlier cradle style restraint and 
purchase a further restraint for seating in the upright 
position. This represents a significant expense, and it is 
therefore desirable to provide a dual position child 
restraint which is suitable for use with a child from the age  
 
of birth to six months, and is also suitable for use with 
older children for seating them in an upright position. Dual position child restraints are known, and normally 
comprise a seat arrangement which in a first position acts as 
a cradle having a sloping portion against which the back of 
an infant may rest, and which in a second position can be 
used with an infant sitting upright. A single restraint can 
be arranged so that it is supported on a vehicle seat in two 
different positions. In the case of a cradle style 
restraint, the infant is reclined with the cradle positioned 
so that the infant's back is facing the

<CLAIMS>
A dual position child restraint for use on a motor 
vehicle seat comprising a child restraint seat having 

longitudinal stiffening ribs extending across the rear 
surfaces thereof, the seat comprising a back support portion 

and a seat portion and being positionable on the vehicle seat 
so that in a first position of use the back support portion 

is in a substantially reclined position, while in a second 
position of use the back portion is in a substantially 

vertical position, characterised in that the seat is provided 
with a base support arranged to distribute load over a 

substantially large surface area to prevent damage to said 
vehicle seat, said base support being adapted for attachment 

to said seat in two support positions so that it can support 
the child restraint seat on the vehicle seat in either of 

said two positions of use. 
A dual position child restraint according to claim 1 
wherein said base support is hingedly attached to said child 

restraint seat so that it can rotate between its two support 
positions. 
A dual position child restraint according to claim 1 or 
claim 2 wherein said base support has longitudinal channels 

and recesses formed in each of its major surfaces, said 
channels and recesses being arranged to receive and locate at 

least some of said longitudinal stiffening ribs. 
A dual position child restraint according to claim 2 
wherein said base support has clips formed thereon which 

engage portions of the child restraint seat to releasably 
clip said base support in at least one of its support 

positions. 
A dual position child restraint according to any one of 
the preceding claims wherein a spacer is placed between said 

base support and said child restraint seat to vary the 
inclination of said child restraint seat. 
A dual position child restraint according to any one of 
claims 1 to 4 wherein tilt support means is attached to said 

base support and operable to vary the inclination of said 
child restraint seat. 
A dual position child restraint according to claim 6 
wherein said tilt support means comprises a tilt frame that 

is pivotally attached to said base support so that it can be 
stored in an out-of-use position within the base support, and 

rotated out of the base support when used to vary the 
inclination of said child restraint seat. 
A dual position child restraint according to claim 7 
wherein said tilt frame comprises a lever arm connected 

thereto for manually actuating movement of the tilt frame. 
A dual position child restraint according to claim 7 or 
claim 8 wherein said base support is provided with clip means 

for releasably clipping the tilt frame to the base support 
when the tilt frame is in its out-of-use position. 
A dual position child restraint as hereinbefore 
described with reference to and as illustrated in the 

accompanying drawings.
