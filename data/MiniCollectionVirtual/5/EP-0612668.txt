<ABSTRACT>
A plastic tamper indicating closure (12) including a base wall (13), 
a peripheral skirt (14) having an inner surface with interengaging 

threads (15) 
engaging cooperating threads on a container such that said closure (12) 

is removed by relative rotation. A first interrupted score line (18) 
extends circumferentially about the skirt defining a weakened line 

by interrupted scores forming bridges and defining a wider connecting 
portion (19). The score line (18) defines a tamper indicating band (17) 

which has 
portions for engaging an annular bead (26) on a container (11) to inhibit 

removal of the closure (12) such that the bridges must be broken to 
remove 

the closure. The tamper indicating band has a first axial score 
line (20) adjacent the connecting portion (19) that has its upper end 

intersecting the interrupted score line (18). A second axial score line 
(21) is spaced circumferentially from the first axial score line (20) 

and 
extending from the lower edge of the tamper indicating band (17) and has 

an upper edge spaced from the weakened line of the band to define a 
strap (22) such that the band (17) successively expands at the second 

score 
line (21) and the first score line (20) as the closure (12) is applied 

to a container (11) 
and as the closure (12) is removed, the strap (22) yields and the 

weakened line 
is broken and the strap (22) is severed at said second score line (21) 

leaving 
the tamper indicating band (17) attached to the closure (12) by the 

connecting portion (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tamper indicating closures 
as defined in the preamble of claim 1 as well as a method of 
making such a closure. In providing tamper indicating closures, it is conventional 
to form a tamper indicating band that is connected to the closure 
by integral bridges and the band has means thereon for engaging an 
annular flange or the like on the container such that when the closure 
is unthreaded from the container the bridges are broken. Such 
closures are shown for example in Unites Patents 4,613,052, 4,721,218, 
4,801,030, 4,801,031, and 5,080,246. Another aspect of tamper indicating closures is to provide 
the band so that it is not completely severed from the closure when 
the closure is removed from the container. Such constructions are 
shown, for example, in United States patents 3,904,062, 4,033,472, 
4,205,755, 4,530,436, 4,545,496, 4,458,821, 4,666,053 
(corresponding to the preamble of claim 1), 
4,720,018, 
4,978,016 and 5,080,246, 
and in Specification GB-A-2255553. Among the objectives of the present invention are to provide 
an improved tamper indicating closure which will accommodate the 
expansion of the tamper indicating band during application; wherein 
the tamper indicating band passes over the retention bead or flange 
on the container and fully seats on the container after closure 
application; wherein when the closure is removed from the container, 
the tamper indicating band is maintained on the closure; and wherein 
a portion of the connecting band provides a large gap giving more 
visual indication that the tamper indicating band has been severed 
from the container.  
 In accordance with the invention, the plastic tamper 
indicating closure comprises a base wall, a peripheral skirt having 
an inner surface with interengaging threads engaging cooperating 
threads on a container such that said closure is removed by relative 
rotation. A first interrupted score line extends circumferentially 
about the skirt defining a weakened line by interrupted scores forming 
bridges and defining a wider connecting portion. The score line 
defines a tamper indicating band. The band has portions for engaging 
an annular bead on a container to inhibit removal of the closure 
such that the bridges must be broken to remove the closure. The 
tamper indicating band has a first axial score line adjacent the 
connecting portion that has its upper end intersecting the interrupted 
score line. A second axial score line is spaced circumferentially 
from the first axial score line

<CLAIMS>
A plastic tamper indicating closure comprising 

a base wall (13), 
a peripheral skirt (14) having an inner surface with thread 
means (15) adapted to engage cooperating thread means (16) on a container 

such that said closure is removed by relative rotation, 
an interrupted score line (18) extending circumferentially 
about the skirt defining a weakened line by interrupted scores 

which form bridges and define a wider connecting portion (19), 
said score line defining a tamper indicating band (17) having 
interengaging means (25) thereon for engaging means (26) on a container to 

inhibit removal of said closure such that the weakened line must be 
broken to remove said closure, 
a first axial score line (20) on said tamper indicating band (17) 
adjacent said connecting portion 

and a second axial score line (21) on said tamper indicating 
band spaced circumferentially from said first axial score line 

(20) and extending from the lower edge of said tamper indicating 
band characterised in that said first axial score line (20) has 

an upper end 
intersecting said interrupted score line (18) and a lower end spaced 

from the lower edge of said tamper indicating band, 
and said second axial score line (21) has 
an upper edge spaced from the upper end of said band to form 

a strap (24) such that said band successively expands at said second 
score line and first score line as the closure is applied to a container 

and as the closure is removed, said strap yields and the weakened 
line is broken and the strap is severed from the tamper indicating  

 
band leaving the tamper indicating band attached to said closure by 

said connecting portion. 
The tamper indicating closure set forth in claim 1 
wherein said first (20) and second (21) score lines are positioned such that 

said strap is deformed beyond its elastic limit when the closure is 
removed providing further visual evidence of the removal of the 

closure. 
The tamper indicating closure set forth in claim 2 
wherein said interengaging means on said closure for engaging means 

on a container comprises flange means (25) extending upwardly and 
inwardly from said band, said second score line also extending 

through said flange means. 
The tamper indicating closure set forth in any one of 
claims 1-3 including a container having bead means engaging said 

interengaging means. 
The method of making a plastic tamper indicating closure 
comprising 


forming a plastic closure having a base wall, a 
peripheral skirt an inner surface with thread means adapted to  

 
engage cooperating thread means on a container such that said 

closure is removed by relative rotation, 
providing a first interrupted score line extending 
circumferentially about the skirt to define a weakened line by 

interrupted scores forming bridges and defining a connecting 
portion, said score line defining a tamper indicating band having 

means thereon for engaging means on a container to inhibit removal 
of said closure such that the weakened line must be broken to 

remove said closure, 
forming a first axial score line adjacent said connecting 
portion and having an upper end intersecting said interrupted score 

line, 
forming a second axial score line spaced 
circumferentially from said first axial score and extending from 

the lower edge of said band and having an upper edge spaced from 
the interrupted score line of said tamper indicating band to define 

a strap such that said band successively expands at said second 
score line and said first score line as the closure is applied to 

a container and as the closure is removed, said strap yields, the 
bridges are broken and the strap is severed at said second score 

line leaving the tamper indicating band attached to said closure by 
said connecting portion. 
The method set forth in claim 5 including the step of 
forming flange means comprising said interengaging means.  

 
The method set forth in claim 6 including the step of 
forming said second score line such that it extends through said 

flange means.
