<ABSTRACT>
An automatic device has a pipette (46) which is movable by motors along a guided path (48) between first and second locations at which a supply and storage vial (43) and a rack (45) for carrying one or more receptacle tubes (44) are respectively positioned. The motors operate also to lower the tip of the pipette (46) into positions to aspirate liquid from the storage vial (43) and to expel the aspirated liquid into one of the receptacle tubes (44), and the pipette has associated with it an automatically operating device for drawing liquid into and expelling liquid from the pipette tip. In an alternative construction, a single location is provided in which either a supply vial or a dispensing container can be positioned. In automatic operation, all of the liquid in the vial is drawn into the pipette and is subsequently discharged in required quantities into dispensing containers placed successively in said locations. In both constructions, all essential data concerning the contents of the vial are automatically read from the vial and stored and/or displayed. Similarly essential data relating to the contents discharged into the dispensing containers is stored and/or displayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a storage and dispensing device for liquids 
and has an important application in dealing with small volumes of radioactive or 
toxic solutions. In present practice such materials are commonly handled by 
manual methods involving the use of hand held pipetting devices to remove 
quantities of the material from the container in which the material is supplied by 
the manufacturer. The use of such manual pipetting devices to effect removal of 
material can expose the user to certain hazards arising from the process. In 
order to remove liquid from the container or vial with such a device the user is 
required to open the vial, insert the tip of the pipette, draw up the required 
volume, remove the tip from the vial and then dispense the aspirated liquid into a 
further container. During this process the user is exposed to the contents of the 
vial with the potential risk of exposure to radiation from a radioactive substance or 
to toxic vapours or aerosols from a toxic substance. Furthermore, during the 
operation the liquid contained within the tip of the pipetting device is transferred 
between the storage vial and the second container giving a potential risk of 
spillage or contamination of the working area or the user. Publication No. WO 88/05541 describes apparatus for dispensing a 
medium into receptacles arranged in groups on plates. The apparatus is 
especially suited for conducting immunochemical and microbiological analysis. 
The apparatus includes a gripping head movable in three space directions and 
automatic means for actuating a pipette to draw and expel a controlled volume of 
the medium. The apparatus also includes means for detecting the presence of a 
suitable receptacle. U.S. Patent No. 4671123 discloses a pipetting device in which 
manual dispensing operation is replaced by a piston actuated by an electronically 
controlled motor. The device is however directly equivalent to the manual 
pipetting device in that in the handling of radioactive or toxic substances the 
operator is still exposed to the same degree of hazard.  
 The handling of such toxic or radioactive materials is often 
governed by local or statutory  
 
regulations that require the user accurately to record 
usage of the material and account for all waste 
disposed from experimental use of such materials. In 
common practice, where manual pipetting of the material 
is used to effect transfer of the material from the 
stock vial, such recording is achieved by means of a 
written record. Under

<CLAIMS>
A pipetting device comprising means for locating a supply 
container (43) in a predetermined position, a pipette (46), automatic means 

(47,48,49,50,51) for actuating guided movement of the pipette (46) into said 

predetermined position and selected operative positions for abstracting liquid from 
said supply container (43) and discharging the abstracted liquid into receiving 

containers (44) disposed in said selected operative positions respectively, means 
for drawing controlled volumes of liquid into and expelling liquid from the pipette 

(46), means for detecting the presence of a container in said predetermined 
position or in an operative position towards which the pipette is actuated to move 

by said automatic means and adapted to interrupt operation of the device in the 
absence of the container, and a rack (45) removably and replaceably disposed in 

a predetermined location and comprising a base portion (62) having means for 
locating the receiving containers (44) in said respective selected positions, said 

pipetting device being characterised in that the rack (45) further comprises a lid 
assembly (64,66) comprising upper (66) and lower (64) lid elements, whereof the 

lower element (64) has vertical holes (65) for extending about the respective 
receiving containers (44) and the upper element (66) has vertical holes (67) and is 

movable into and out of a position in which the holes (67) therein register with the 
holes (65) in the lower element to open access to the receiving containers (44). 
A device as in claim 1, wherein means is provided which initiates 
automated pipetting operation of the device in response to movement of the rack 

(45) into a predetermined position in the device. 
A device as in claim 1 or claim 2 which incorporates an electronic 
memory which monitors the volumes of liquid dispensed and a display to show 

the remaining volume after each dispensing operation. 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
means is provided for reading coded information carried on a container fed into 

the device and for displaying the decoded information. 
A device as claimed in claim 4, wherein means is provided for  
 

producing a printed record of and/or storing said information. 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the device is provided with a means of preventing unauthorised use. 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
the pipette has a tip (21) which can be discarded and the rack (45) has means 

adapted to carry a replacement tip in a position in which the pipette can be moved 
for automatically attaching the tip thereto. 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
means is provided for dislodging and propelling into a container from which the 

pipette has just been withdrawn any residual liquid adhering to the pipette. 
A device as claimed in claim 8, wherein the means for dislodging 
and propelling said residual liquid into the container comprises a downwardly 

directed air nozzle to which nozzle air under pressure is supplied. 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims further 
comprising a shield (18) which is mounted for movement into and out of a position 

in which it is disposed between an operator of the device and the pipette. 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
said means for drawing controlled volumes of liquid into and expelling liquid from 

the pipette (19) comprises a linear stepping motor (20) connected to a piston in
