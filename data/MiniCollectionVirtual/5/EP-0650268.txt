<ABSTRACT>
A radio system has a master station including a wideband receiver (102), 
an A/D converter (103) and a digital signal processing module (104) for each of a 

plurality of space diversity antennas (101-1,---101-M), the digital signal processing 
module being for converting the digitized samples into the frequency domain (in 

110), and weighting (in 111) the frequency domain signals. The weighted signals 
are then combined (in 112) and separated (by 113,114,115) into signals 

corresponding to those transmitted from the remote stations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to systems having a plurality
of space diversity antennas.Mobile radio is today presented with a number of
alternative and largely incompatible signal transmission
systems, including the analog system of AMPS, the North
American Digital Mobile Radio Standard IS-54, and Qualcomm's
CDMA system. The systems each require dedicated,
application-specific hardware and most of the hardware
designed for one system is useless with the others.
Furthermore, although various techniques have been proposed
in each of these systems to improve performance and increase
capacity by reducing signal interference and fading
problems, implementation of these techniques in any given
system is often seriously constrained by the expense
entailed in the required hardware addition and/or
replacement.For example, the use of space diversity reception at
the base station has been proposed to overcome fading and
signal interference. In a space diversity radio system,
signals received by a plurality of antennas are processed to
overcome fading and interference due to other users. See,
in this regard, "Optimum Combining in Digital Mobile Radio
with Cochannel Interference", J. H. Winters, in the IEEE
Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol. SAC-2, No.
4, July 1984. Such processing can include multiplying the
signal from each antenna element by a controllable weight to
adjust the phase and amplitude of the signal and then
combining these signals to generate the output signal. The
pattern of the adaptive array is thereby changed to reduce
the power of interfering signals and to optimize desired 
signal reception, substantially increasing the capacity and
performance of mobile radio systems. Similarly, multiple
transmit antennas at the base station can be used to improve
the capacity and performance at the mobile. In particular,
using optimum combining, whereby the signals are weighted
and combined to minimize the mean square error in the output
signal, an M-fold increase in capacity can be achieved with
M antennas, as shown in "The capacity of wireless
communication systems can be substantially increased by the
use of antenna diversity", R. D. Gitlin, J. Salz, J. H.
Winters, in the Proc. of the First International Conference
on Universal Personal Communications, September 29 - October
2, 1992, Dallas, TX, pp. 28-32. Thus, modular growth can be
achieved by simply adding antennas to the base station.
Although the major cost of such improvements is now at the
base station, where the cost is shared among the
