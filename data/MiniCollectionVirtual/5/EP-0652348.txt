<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connecting device for the parts of a frame, in particular of a door-frame lining, comprising     - a securing means   - a tightening element and   - a connecting piece, it being possible for the securing means and the tightening element to be inserted into in each case one of two opposite depressions in the mitred region of the frame parts and for the connecting device to be tightened after the insertion. In order to facilitate mounting, the connecting device (1) exhibits, at one end, a claw-type device (KV), which holds itself in one depression (7, 7'), as securing means and is provided, at the opposite end, with an adjustment-screw tightening device (VS). It is possible to gain access to the latter from the outside by way of a concealable bore (6) in the frame.
