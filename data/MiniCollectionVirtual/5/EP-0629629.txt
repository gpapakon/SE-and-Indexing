<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a pulverulent organometallic compound containing tin and a halogen, especially fluorine, intended to be pyrolysed under the effect of heat at the surface of a transparent substrate, especially made of glass, in order to form there a layer of tin oxide doped with a halogen possessing properties on (regarding) infrared and/or electrical radiation. Its particle size is chosen such that the d90 particle diameter is between 40 and 200 micrometres, especially 50 and 150 micrometres and preferably 60 and 100 micrometres.
