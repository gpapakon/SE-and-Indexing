<ABSTRACT>
Multi-user communications system which combines means (12, 22) (12B, 22B) implementing the technique of spread spectrum coding SSC with means (14n, 24n) (14Bn, 24Bm) implementing the technique of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM. This makes it possible to enhance the performance of the SSC system by simplifying certain data acquisition and processing mechanisms. One favoured use is in systems for telephone communication between mobile stations (U1, U2) and base stations (B). Application: telephone communications system.
