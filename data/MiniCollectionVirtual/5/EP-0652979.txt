<DESCRIPTION>
 INORGANIC PERBROHIDE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOFFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to compositions containing inorganic perbromides and having desirable physical characteristics such as high bromine levels and low bromine vapor pressures. The invention further relates to the use of such compositions for the recovery of precious metals, including platinum and palladium, from a variety of sources thereof. The invention further relates to a method for the electrolytic production of bromine solutions, and to the use of electrolytically produced from mixed halide bromine solutions in applications including precious metal recovery and water treatment. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTIt is desirable in a number of applications to have a source of bromine in high concentration, but without requiring the handling of liquid bromine or solutions having a substantial bromine vapor pressure. While various bromine compositions have been proposed in the prior art, many of these have had disadvantageous physical properties such as high bromine vapor pressures, high thermodynamic crystallization temperatures or poor freeze/thaw stability. Bromine solutions have been used for the recovery of certain precious metals. Prior art recovery processes using molecular bromine have been effective, but pure bromine is a corrosive, fuming liquid which generates a suffocating vapor and must be subjected to special handling. Bromine can be dissolved in water to a certain extent, but the resulting solutions exhibit a substantial bromine vapor pressure. Molecular bromine can be generated from the acidification of alkali metal bromates, but by themselves bromates provide only a limited source of molecular bromine, and bromate salt solutions have a high crystallization temperature which makes them inconvenient to use as leaching agents for precious metals.
