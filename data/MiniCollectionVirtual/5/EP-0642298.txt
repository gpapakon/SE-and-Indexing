<ABSTRACT>
The soldering system uses at least one soldering device which is heated via an electrical resistance heating, with a reflow soldering electrode (1) displaced upwards and downwards relative to the electronic component terminals (3). The solder edge (6) of the electrode contacts a row of component terminals and presses them against projecting solder pads (4) carried by the surface of a PCB, the temp. at the solder points being raised to the melting temp., while the melting temp. is maintained, the applied force is increased in steps until a max. force is reached. The latter is then reduced before reducing the temp. to a residual value maintained during hardening of the solder

Method for soldering surface-mountable electronic 
components having terminal legs (3) on printed circuit 

boards (2), use being made of at least one soldering 
device which contains a rigid iron electrode (1) for 

reflow soldering, which electrode can be heated by 
electrical resistance heat, can be moved upwards and 

downwards perpendicularly to the row of terminal legs and 
via which a pressure force acting on the terminal legs 

(3) of the component and directed at associated pads (5) 
is applied in a regulated manner as a function of the 

temperature at the soldering location, having the following 
steps: 


the yoke electrode (1) is placed by its soldering 
edge (6) on a row of terminal legs (3) and is 

pressed with a small force (F1) onto the highest 
upwardly projecting solder deposit (4) on an associated 

pad (5), 
the temperature at the soldering location is 
increased to the melting temperature (T2) and temporarily 

held, 
while the melting temperature (T2) or a subsequent 
excessive temperature (T3) is present, the force 

applied by the yoke electrode (1) is increased in a 
plurality of steps or continuously up to a maximum 

force (F24), thereby producing a constant pressure 
force, referring to the number of terminal legs (3) 

pressed down simultaneously, over the time characteristic 
of the force increase, and 
before the maximum temperature present is reduced, 
the maximum applied force is reduced down to a  

 
residual force (F3) and held until the solidification 

process is concluded, thereby enabling stresses 
in the as yet unsolidified solder (4) to be 

relieved. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the temperature at the soldering location and the 

force applied by the yoke electrode (1) are regulated to 
obtain linear temperature/time and force/time characteristics.
