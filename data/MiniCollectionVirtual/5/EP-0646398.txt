<ABSTRACT>
A remote controller comprises a housing having a 
steering wheel portion 1. A pendulum 4 inside the 

housing is pivotally fixed at one end so that its other 
end is free to swing under the influence of gravity. 

When the housing is tilted to the left or the right the 
pendulum 4 comes into contact with a left or a right 

contact plate 7, completing an electrical circuit of a 
control unit and causing a signal to be transmitted to 

the remotely controlled device to turn either to the 
right or to the left.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to remote control 
devices and in particular, though not necessarily, to 
remote control devices for use with toys, for example 
cars, trucks, boats, aeroplanes and other toys whose 
movement can be controlled remotely. The various remote controllers for toys available 
at present comprise user operated pendulum to control 
the direction of movement of the toy. Generally, a 
pendulum is pushed to the right to make the toy move to 
the right or the pendulum is pushed to the left to make 
the toy move to the left. This process, though 
logical, lacks intuitiveness as, when the toy is facing 
the operator, the definitions of left and right are 
reversed. This arrangement also does not provide the same 
feeling as driving with a steering wheel which is, 
after all, the "real world" situation. According to the present invention there is 
provided a controller for issuing control command 
signals, the controller comprising a housing containing 
means for transmitting left and right turn command 
signals to a remote device, characterised in that there 
is mounted within the housing means arranged to move 
under the influence of gravity in dependence upon the 
tilting of the housing in one direction or another and 
means responsive to those movements for causing the 
respective turn command signals to be transmitted. A preferred embodiment of the present invention 
has the outward appearance of a steering wheel of a 
car. It has two parts: a front cabinet shaped like a 
steering wheel and a rear cabinet. The major 
components are: a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) on which 
are mounted electronic components, mechanical  
 
controlling components, a power switch, a forward and 
reverse control knob, a battery compartment and an 
antenna. The forward and reverse control knob is located at 
the hub or central region of the steering wheel and is 
easily accessible to either of the operator's thumbs. 
Pushing the knob towards the top of the unit produces 
forward motion of the remotely controlled toy whilst 
pulling the knob towards the bottom produces reverse 
motion of the toy. Left and right directional control is achieved by 
tilting the steering wheel to the left or to the right. 
This characteristic is achieved by means, in the 
preferred embodiment, of a pendulum located inside the 
cabinet and rotatably fixed to it at only one end 
region. The opposite end region of the pendulum is 
free to move under the influence of gravity until it 
touches one of two metal contact plates located

<CLAIMS>
A controller for issuing control command signals, 
the controller comprising a housing (1, 2) containing 

means (IC101) for transmitting left and right turn 
command signals to a remote device, characterised in 

that there is mounted within the housing (1, 2) means 
(4) arranged to move under the influence of gravity in 

dependence upon the tilting of the housing in one 
direction or another and means (7) responsive to those 

movements for causing the respective turn command 
signals to be transmitted. 
A controller according to claim 1, wherein a 
portion (1) of the housing has the outward appearance 

of a steering wheel. 
A controller according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
means (4) arranged to move under the influence of 

gravity comprises a pendulum arrangement (4) movable 
relative to the housing. 
A controller according to claim 3, wherein the 
means (7
) responsive to movement comprises contact 
means arranged to be actuated by the pendulum when the 

housing is tilted in the one and the other direction. 
A controller according to claim 4, wherein the 
contact means comprises left and right contact means 

(7) located respectively to one and the other side of 
the pendulum arrangement (4). 
A controller according to claim 5, wherein the 
pendulum arrangement (4) comprises a projecting 

electrically conducting member (15) arranged to contact 
one or other of the contact means (7) when the housing 

is tilted and thereby to complete an electrical 
circuit. 
A controller according to claim 4, 5 or 6, wherein 
the contact means (7) are fixed only at one end region 

so that their remaining portions are free to bend and 
recover elastically. 
A controller according to claim 7, comprising means 
(16) projecting from the housing so as to lie between 

the free portions of the contact means (7) thereby to 
prevent the contact means from contacting the pendulum 

arrangement (4) when the device is held in an upright 
position. 
A controller according to any one of claims 3 to 
8, wherein the pendulum arrangement (4) comprises a 

hollow cylindrical portion (17) which is sleeved on a 
post projecting from an inside surface of the housing 

so that the pendulum arrangement can pivot about the 
post. 
A controller according to any one of claims 3 to 9 
wherein the lowermost end of the pendulum arrangement 

(4) comprises a metal plate (13). 
A controller according to any one of claims 3 to 
10, wherein the range of pivoting of the pendulum 

arrangement (4) with respect to the housing is limited 
by two stops (12). 
A controller according to claim 11, wherein the 
stops are positioned to provide a limit of no more than 

about 35o each way from a central position. 
A controller according to claim 12, wherein the 
limit is no more than about 25o. 
A controller according to any one of the preceding 
claims, comprising an antenna (11) attached to the 

housing and extending substantially vertically when the 
housing is in a central position.
