<ABSTRACT>
A method of testing semiconductor chips is disclosed. The 
individual semiconductor chips have I/O, power, and ground 

contacts. In the method of the invention a chip carrier is 
provided. The chip carrier has contacts corresponding to the 

contacts on the semiconductor chip. The carrier contacts have 
dendritic surfaces. The chip contacts are brought into 

conductive contact with the conductor pads on the chip carrier. 
Test signal input vectors are applied to the inputs of the 

semiconductor chip, and output signal vectors are recovered from 
the semiconductor chip. After testing, the chip may be removed 

from the substrate. Alternatively, the chip may be bonded 
through the dendritic conductor pads to the substrate after 

successful testing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to integrated circuit chip testing. 
Typically, integrated circuit chips are attached to a chip 
carrier, thermally conductive module chip carrier, circuit card 
or board, e.g., by solder bonding, controlled collapse chip 
connect, or the like. For the first time since the wafer was 
diced, the chip is tested, e.g., electrically tested and 
logically tested. Some of the tests are subtle, for example 
tests for active and passive pattern faults and "stuck at 1" or 
"stuck at 0" faults. When a fault is found, the chip is removed 
from the card or board. This is not a simple "desoldering" 
step, especially in the case of high I/O density integrated 
circuit chips, bonded with encapsulation chip connect 
technologies, and usually present in multi-chip modules. When a 
chip is found to be defective, it must be removed, the chip site 
redressed, and a new chip installed for testing. In the case of 
a polymeric substrate, redressing the chip site might include 
milling. According to the method of the invention, there is provided a 
method of testing semi-conductor chips. The individual 
semiconductor chips have I/O, power, and ground contacts. In 
the method of the invention a chip carrier is provided. The 
chip carrier may be the substrate, or a dedicated fixture just 
for testing chips. This chip carrier has contacts corresponding 
to the contacts on the semiconductor chip. The carrier contacts 
are low contact resistance contacts adapted for holding the 
integrated circuit chip in place during testing, with low 
impedance, while allowing easy removal of defective chips and 
their replacement by other chips.  According to the invention the test fixture contacts have 
dendritic surfaces. By dendrites are meant essentially vertical 
members extending outwardly from a generally planar area of 
conductive material. The dendrites, produced by a columnar 
growth process, generally have an aspect ratio, of vertical to 
horizontal dimensions, of at least about 1.0, a height above the 
planar area of conductive material of about 10 to 100 
micrometers. The chip contacts are brought into conductive contact with the 
dendrite bearing conductor pads on the chip carrier. Conductive 
contact requires a low impedance, low contact resistance 
contact, with the integrated circuit chips being secured from 
lateral movement with respect to the substrate or fixture. Test 
signal input vectors are applied to the inputs of the 
semiconductor chip, and output signal vectors are recovered from 
the
