Central buffer coupling for rail vehicles with a 
two-part coupling shaft which is formed of a front shaft 

part carrying the coupling head of the central buffer 
coupling and of a rear shaft part articulated so that it 

can pivot horizontally on the frame of the rail vehicle 
and whose two shaft parts are joined together by a 

vertical connecting pin and pivotable about this 
connecting pin and in relation to one another and one 

shaft part of which in the articulation area engages over 
the other shaft part in the manner of a yoke with an 

upper and a lower yoke limb, whereby the two shaft parts 
are lockable in relation to one another in their mutually 

extended position in which the coupling head lies outside 
the vehicle profile, by a locking device forming a rigid 

coupling shaft and whereby the front shaft part is 
pivotable, after releasing the locking device, into a 

position in which the coupling head lies inside the 
vehicle profile, and whereby the locking device provided 

is a bolt which is displaceable to a limited degree in 
the longitudinal direction on the coupling shaft and in 

the mutually extended position of the two shaft parts is 
displaceable by the force of a spring into a locking 

position in which the bolt associated with one shaft part 
engages in a slot associated with the other shaft part to 

make the coupling shaft rigid, characterised in that the 
slot (6) and the bolt (7) are disposed in the vertical 

central longitudinal plane, in that the bolt (7) is 
supported vertically by means of in each case one 

retaining plate (8) on the upper and the lower yoke limbs 
of the yoke (4) with the aid of pins (9) and is 

displaceable against the force of the spring (13) within 
a vertical slot (16) disposed in the front shaft part (2  

 
or 3), in that the retaining plates (8) are secured 

pivotably to the upper and lower yoke limbs by means of a 
further pin (11) on one side of the vertical central 

longitudinal plane, in that the pins (9) in the retaining 
plates (8) are in each case guided in an elongated hole 

(17) and in that an operating element (handle 18) is 
secured to the retaining plates (8). 
Central buffer coupling according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the slot (6) is formed with a 

receiving mouth widening towards the front. 
Central buffer coupling according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the front shaft part (2) is 

pivotable in relation to the rear shaft part (3) through 
approximately 150°. 
Central buffer coupling according to one of claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the retaining plates (8) are 

pivotable through approximately 60°. 
Central buffer coupling according to one of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the locking device with the 

bolt (7) and the slot (6) is disposed between the 
connecting pin (5) and the coupling head (81). 
Central buffer coupling according to one of claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that on one side of the vertical 

central longitudinal plane the rear shaft part (3) 
exhibits a bevelled leading face (20) against which the 

bolt (7) comes to bear when pivoted out of the pivoted 
position into the extended position and on which the bolt 

(7) is displaced against the force of the spring (13) 
towards the rear in the direction of the thrust element 

(14) when pivoted further. 
Central buffer coupling according to one of claims 1 

to 6, characterised in that a cover (21) which covers the 
slot (6) of the rear shaft part (3) in the pivoted 

position, is secured to the front shaft part (2).  
 
Central buffer coupling according to one of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the locking device with the 

bolt (7) and the slot (6) is disposed between the 
connecting pin (5) for the two shaft parts (2,3) and the 

articulation of the rear shaft part (3). 
Central buffer coupling according to one of claims 1 
to 4 or 8, characterised in that on one side of the 

vertical central longitudinal plane the front shaft part 
(3) exhibits a bevelled leading face (20) against which 

the bolt (7) comes to bear when pivoted out of the 
extended position and on which the bolt (7) is displaced 

against the force of the spring (13) towards the rear in 
the direction of the thrust element (14) when pivoted 

further. 
Central buffer coupling according to one of claims 1 
to 4 or 8 to 9, characterised in that a cover (21) which 

covers the slot (6) of the front shaft part (2) in the 
pivoted position, is secured to the rear shaft part (3).
