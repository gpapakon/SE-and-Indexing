<ABSTRACT>
A system for positioning a work point (6) has a plurality of reeving systems (2, 3) spaced apart fom one another, with each reeving system having an adjustable support element (4, 5) connected to it. These support elements are also connected to the work point, with the length of the support elements between the work point and the reeving determining the work point's location. Associated with each reeving system is an actuator (46) adapted for releasing and taking up the support element. A control system (43) controls the actuators to release and take up each of the support elements to move the work point with respective to at least two spatial coordinate axes while controlling at least one motion parameter of the work point in a predetermined manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYSTEM FOR POSITIONING A WORKPOINTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application is being filed with an appendix of computer program listings.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a system for positioning a workpoint.There are many industrial tasks that require the positioning of a human worker or a tool or machine well above or below ground level. For example, in nuclear power plants, radioactive contamination may adhere to the reactor cavity walls during refueling operations. This contamination can become airborne when the reactor cavity walls are left to dry, thus contaminating the entire building. To prevent this, reactor cavity walls must be quickly cleaned before the drying can occur. 

The cleaning process can involve abrasive scrubbing, application of superheated pressurized water followed by vacuuming, high pressure blasting or application of a strippable coating which binds the contamination. In any of these decontamination processes, a human worker and/or a tool or working machine must be positioned at a point near the reactor wall to begin the cleaning operation, and must be moved up, down and across the cavity wall so that the entire structure may be cleaned completely. Because the reactor cavity wall is tall, the positioning and movement required to carry out the work is cumbersome, costly and often dangerous.Typically, the worker or machine is deployed through the use of a crane positioned above a reactor cavity. A cleaning machine may be affixed to the arm of the crane, which then positions the machine at a point in the x-y plane adjacent the wall. Alternatively, a human worker having the necessary cleaning equipment enters a basket at the end of the crane arm, and is moved from place to place along the wall to effect manual cleaning. In either case, the crane is generally deployed from above the reactor cavity. This deployment is undesirable, since the use of these cranes is vital for other tasks, and their unavailability to support reactor cavity decontamination can extend the length of the refueling outage. This is a very costly situation.Many other industrial applications require a similar positioning of a human worker, tool or machine. Fossil boilers, storage tanks for commodities such as water and conventional fuels, shipyards, dams and bridges, commercial and industrial buildings, skyscrapers, hangars, silos and towers all have a tall vertical surface that may need to be fully traversed to effect 

cleaning, painting, maintenance, repair or construction
