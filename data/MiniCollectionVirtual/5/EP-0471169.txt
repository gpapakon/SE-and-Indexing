<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for regulating the mixture or fuel quantity fed to the cylinders of an internal combustion engine, with a device for the variable metering of the mixture or fuel quantity to the cylinders of the internal combustion engine, a device for detecting the actual value of the mixture or fuel quantity fed in by means of the measurement of the stroke of a valve means arranged in such a way that it can move in the metering device, and with a device for regulating the movement of the valve. In order to be able to determine the actual metered quantity with great accuracy while using simple and inexpensive sensors, it is proposed that the stroke duration of the valve means assigned to each cylinder be determined with the aid of a position sensor and regulated to an identical value for all the valve means.

Method for regulating the mixture quantity fed to 
the cylinders of an internal combustion engine using an 

inlet valve for the variable metering of the mixture 
quantity to the cylinders of the internal combustion 

engine, a device for acquiring the actual value of the 
mixture quantity fed in, by means of measuring the stroke 

of the inlet valve, and an arrangement for regulating the 
inlet valve movement, characterized in that the stroke 

duration (Δt₁, Δt₂ etc.) of the inlet valve allocated to 
each cylinder (2) is determined by establishing the time 

difference from the overshooting of a predetermined 
threshold value (h
s
) for the stroke (h), which lies in 
the stroke range above the run-up ramp (11) of the stroke 

characteristic, to the undershooting of the predetermined 
stroke threshold value (h
s
) of the inlet valve and is 
regulated to an identical value for all the inlet valves. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the stroke duration (Δt₁, Δt₂ etc.) is regulated as 

a function of engine operating parameters (8). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that for each inlet valve a position sensor (3) is 

provided which in each case outputs a signal when a 
particular stroke of the inlet valve is overshot or 

undershot.
