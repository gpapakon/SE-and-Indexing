<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing synthesis gas by
reacting a hydrocarbyl feed material with a source of oxygen at an elevated
temperature. More particularly, this invention relates to the preparation of
synthesis gas using new nickel-containing catalytic materials that are
unusually resistant to deactivation. Additionally, this invention relates to new
nickel-containing catalyst precursor and catalyst compositions that are
useful for the production of synthesis gas and which catalysts are resistant to
coke formation when used to catalyze the reaction of a hydrocarbyl
compound with an oxygen-containing gas at elevated temperatures to form
synthesis gas.Synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular
hydrogen (H2), is a valuable industrial feedstock for the manufacture of a
variety of useful chemicals. For example, synthesis gas can be used to
prepare methanol or acetic acid. Synthesis gas can also be used to prepare
higher molecular weight alcohols or aldehydes as well as higher molecular
weight hydrocarbons.Perhaps the most common commercial source of synthesis gas is the
steam reforming of coal or a hydrocarbon, particularly natural gas. In the
steam reforming process, a mixture of water and the hydrocarbon are
contacted at a high temperature, for example, in the range of about 850 to
about 900°C, and typically in the presence of a catalyst, to form a mixture of
hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Using methane as the hydrocarbon, the
theoretical stoichiometry for the steam reforming reaction is as follows:
CH4 + H2O ------------> 3H2 + CO.
In prior steam reforming processes, because of the large amount of steam
typically necessary to reduce coke formation, the ratio of H2 to CO produced
is typically greater than 3:1 and can be 5:1.The steam reforming reaction is a highly endothermic reaction, and,
as discussed above, it produces a relatively high molar ratio of hydrogen to
carbon monoxide when conventional processes are used. In some
processes using synthesis gas, the excess hydrogen is not necessary and
must be separated from the CO. For example, the manufacture of methanol 
or acetic acid from synthesis gas requires less than a 3:1 molar ratio of
hydrogen to carbon monoxide.There are other methods for preparing synthesis gas that are more
attractive than the steam reforming reaction. Synthesis gas produced by the
partial oxidation of methane, for example, is an exothermic reaction and
produces synthesis gas having a lower ratio of hydrogen to carbon
monoxide, according to
