<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluid 
separation composite membranes prepared from sulfonated 
aromatic polymers in lithium salt form with sulfonic 
acid groups attached to aromatic rings that are 
incorporated into the main polymeric backbone. Permeable or semipermeable membranes are 
known to be used in a variety of fluid separations 
including reverse osmosis and gas separations. These 
membranes can offer, inter alia, significant cost 
savings over other fluid separation means, such as 
adsorption and distillation means. The effectiveness 
of the membranes in fluid separation, however, is 
highly dependent on the permeability and selectivity of 
the membranes, which, in turn, are often dependent on 
membrane forming materials. Sulfonated aromatic polymers are known in the 
art as materials useful in the preparation of fluid 
separation membranes. Among sulfonated aromatic 
polymers, those that can be used advantageously to 
prepare fluid separation membranes, including gas 
separation membranes, are sulfonated polysulfones, 
sulfonated poly(phenylene oxides), sulfonated 
polyetherketones, sulfonated polyamides and sulfonated 
polyureas to name a few. Examples of preparation of 
sulfonated aromatic polymer-based membranes can be 
found in U.S. Patents 4,971,695; 4,954,143; 4,866,099; 
4,717,395; 3,780,496; 3,735,559; 3,709,841, and 
European Patent Application publication 0394505. Preparation of asymmetric and composite  
 
membranes from sulfonated aromatic polymers is 
described extensively in the art. For example, 
preparation of asymmetric polysulfone membranes is 
described in U.S. Patent 3,855,122, and by Graefe et 
al. in "Research on Advanced Membranes for Reverse 
Osmosis," an annual report to the Office of Saline 
Water, Department of the Interior, Contract No. 14-30-2999, 
1973. Preparation of composite sulfonated 
polysulfone membranes is described in U.S. Patents 
5,009,678 and 4,981,498, and by J. E. Cadotte et al. in 
"Research on In Situ-Formed Condensation Polymer for 
Reverse Osmosis Membranes," Final Report, Office of 
Water Research and Technology, U.S. Department of the 
Interior, Contract No. 14-34-001-6521, 1978. 
Preparation of composite sulfonated poly(phenylene 
oxide) membranes is described by A. F. Graefe in 
"Development of a Composite Reverse Osmosis Membrane 
for Single Pass Seawater Desalination," Final Report to 
the Office of Water Research and Technology, Contract 
No. 14-34-0001-7541, 1979, and by R. Huang and J. Kim
