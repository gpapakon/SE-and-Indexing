<ABSTRACT>
Electrode-holder jaws for arc welding, comprising, inside an insulating casing, an internal conducting piece (21), the rear part of which is intended to receive an electrical current-supply cable, and on which is rotationally mounted a lever (11) and a spring (16) acting between the body and the rear arm of the lever. The base of a welding electrode, passing through an insulating cap (10) surmounting the end of the casing, may be clamped between grooves (15) made at the front ends of the piece and of the lever. More particularly, the casing is a sleeve (4) made as a single piece of a flexible and insulating material, completely covering the lever (11) and the conducting piece (21), and being coupled to a cap (10) made of thermosetting and insulating synthetic material.

Electrode holder jaws usable for arc welding comprising, 
inside a one-piece insulating sleeve (4) an internal conducting 

member (21) whereof the rear part is intended to receive an 
electrical current supply cable and on which is rotatably mounted 

a lever (11) and a spring (16) acting between the body and the 
rear arm of the lever, the base of a welding electrode passing 

through an insulating cap (10) surmounting the end of the 
insulating sleeve (4), the base of the electrode being able to 

be gripped between grooves (15) provided in the front ends of the 
member (21) and of the lever (11), characterised in that the 

sleeve (4) is made of flexible material and is connected to the 
cap (10) of thermosetting synthetic material, the lever (11) and 

the conducting member (21) being completely covered by the sleeve 
(4) and the cap (10). 
Electrode holder jaws according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the sleeve (4) comprises, corresponding to the lever 

(11), a rounded longitudinal moulding (2). 
Electrode holder jaws according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the rear end of the flexible sleeve (4), adjacent the 

conductor-wire, comprises various sectile inner diameters (23). 
Electrode holder jaws according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the conducting member (21) has a longitudinal recess (13) 

at the level of the rear arm of the lever (11). 
Electrode holder jaws according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the compression spring (16), ensuring the pressure of the 

lever (11) against the electrode, is installed between the lever 
and the conducting member and this is substantially in the middle 

of the rear arm of this lever. 
Electrode holder jaws according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the insulating cap (10) may be oriented by rotation  

 
through 180Â° about its axis. 
Electrode holder jaws according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the insulating cap (10) has a L-shaped opening (8). 
Electrode holder jaws according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the lever (11) and the conducting member (21) are 

connected by a copper braid (7).
