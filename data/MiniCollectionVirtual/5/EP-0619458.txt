<ABSTRACT>
To provide a rotary furnace burner using solid fuels such as finely granulated coal dust, having a coal dust annular-gap nozzle (12) which is wear-resistant and guarantees a long service life of the burner, it is proposed according to the invention that the solid-fuel duct (10) has in the region of its annular-gap nozzle (12) which lets out the solid-fuel/transporting-air suspension, on at least one of the boundary walls of the annular-gap nozzle, a wear protection consisting of an inherently rigid sleeve-like ceramic body (21) which is detachably and exchangably fixed on a metallic carrying body (22) via an interposed flexible ceramic-fibre layer (23).

A burner for cylindrical rotary kilns, with a channel (10) arranged in an
annular manner for the pneumatic transport of fine-grain solid fuel (carbon

dust) and concentrically enveloped by a primary air ring channel (13) with
exit nozzles (15) distributed over the circumference through which primary

air streams flow with increased speed, 
characterised in that
 in the region of
its annular gap nozzle (12), through which the suspension of solid fuel and

transport air passes, the solid fuel channel (10) is provided with protection
against abrasion for at least one of the annular gap nozzle limiting walls, the

said protection comprising a ceramic body (21) which is secured to a
metallic carrier (22) in a detachable and interchangeable manner with a

flexible ceramic fibre layer (23) arranged between the ceramic body (21) and
the carrier (22).
A burner according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 where the solid fuel
annular gap nozzle (12) diverges outwardly the ceramic body (21) is in the

form of a ceramic cone which is secured to the radial inner limiting wall of
the annular gap nozzle (12) through corresponding conical metallic carriers

(22).
A burner according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the metallic carrier of
the ceramic conus (21) comprises two longitudinal sections (22, 22a),

wherein the longitudinal section (22a) facing away from the opening of the
annular gap nozzle is provided with a ring shoulder (24) which serves as a

limit stop to enable the ceramic cone (21) to be centred and tensioned on
its carrier (22) and on the flexible ceramic fibre layer (23).
A burner according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 a
further primary air channel (18) is arranged radially within the solid fuel

channel (10) and has a torsion generator (19) arranged on its exit opening.
