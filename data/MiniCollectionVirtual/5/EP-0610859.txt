<ABSTRACT>
A section (1), for example, a truss type extruded 
aluminum section (1) is formed of a pair of planar 

plates (2)(3) and ribs (4)(5)(6), wherein hollow 
portions (7)(8)(9) are formed within said section (1) by 

the ribs (4)(5)(6) and the planar plates (2)(3). 
Vibration-damping resin is provided on the inner 

surfaces of hollow portions (7)(8)(9), and particularly, 
on the inner surface of the planar plate (3) and on a 

single surface of the inclined rib (4). With this 
arrangement, the vibration energy bending the planar 

plate (3) and the rib (4) is converted into a heat 
energy. In the case of manufacturing such truss type 

extruded aluminum vibration-damping section (1), for 
making easy the insertion of the vibration-damping resin 

in the hollow portion, the vibration-damping resin is 
stuck on a plastic film (11) to form a long planar body. 

The plastic film (11) serves as a cover or an adhesive. 
Moreover, in the case of directly inserting the 

vibration-damping resin sheet (14), the vibration-damping 
resin sheet (14) is subjected to embossing on 

the adhesive-bonding side for allowing air to be 
escaped. Additionally, in the case using an age-hardening  

 
type aluminum alloy, the adhesive-bonding for 

the vibration-damping resin by heating is performed 
along with the heat treatment for age-hardening. The 

section on which vibration-damping resin is provided is 
not limited to the truss type extruded aluminum section 

(1); but includes a π type extruded or welded aluminum 
section (50). By use of these aluminum sections for 

structural members for a transport vehicle, it is 
possible to extremely prevent the noise energy from 

being transmitted in a cabin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibration-damping
section according to the preamble of claim 1, which is used
for portions required to be prevented from vibration and noise, which comprises a
truss type section formed of a pair of planar plates and
ribs wherein hollow portions are internally formed
and
to a structural member for a transport vehicle using the
above vibration-damping section, see for example FR-A-910.998For example, structural members used for railway
vehicles running in high speed such as the Shinkansen
require materials having light weight and high rigidity.
To meet this requirement, the structural members have
been formed of extruded and/or welded aluminum sections.
A truss type extruded aluminum section, in which ribs
are disposed in zig-zag between two planar plates, is 
used for a floor surface. On the other hand, a π type
extruded aluminum section or a π type welded aluminum
section, in which ribs project from a single surface of
one planar plate, is used for a side wall and roof.Incidentally, an aluminum material being light in
specific gravity tends to transmit vibration and noise
as compared with iron and like being heavy in specific
gravity, and therefore, vibration and noise must be
reduced in consideration of the riding feeling of
passengers. As for the truss type extruded aluminum
section, to prevent the transmission of rolling noise
and motor noise from bogie, the present inventors have
proposed the adoption of a constrained type vibration-damping
structure in which an elastic plate such as an
aluminum plate is stuck on the planar plate on a cabin
side through a resin. Moreover, as for the π type
aluminum section, the recessed portions formed by the
planar plate and ribs have been buried with glass wool
for absorbing sounds.However, for vehicles running in high speed over
270 km/h, the truss type extruded aluminum section is
disadvantageous in that the vibration energy is
attenuated by the portion of the sandwich structure; but
the vibration energy passing through the sandwich 
structure is transmitted by way of the ribs without any
suppression. Further, when the vehicle runs with such a
high speed, there is generated an aerodynamic noise,
which causes a phenomenon of vibrating side walls and a
roof at high frequency. The above-described glass wool,
which is intended to mainly absorb the sound energy
propagating in air, cannot absorb the vibration energy
generated on the side walls and the roof. As a result,
the vibration energy is transmitted to the cabin by way
of the
