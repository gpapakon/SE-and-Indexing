<ABSTRACT>
A wax-free chewing gum is provided, which chewing gum includes a gum base comprising about 20 to about 60 weight percent of a blend of at least two synthetic elastomers, 0 to about 30 weight percent of at least one natural elastomer, about 5 to about 55 weight percent of at least one elastomer plasticizer, about 4 to about 40 weight percent of at least one filler, about 5 to about 40 weight percent of at least one softener, and optional minor amounts of miscellaneous ingredients such as colors, antioxidants, etc. The chewing gum compositions containing the wax-free gum base above also have an initial soft bite, as measured by Taber Stiffness and Instron yields. Taber Stiffness and Instron yields are preferably at least 5 percent lower than those for a comparable wax containing gum. The wax-free chewing gums may be produced and wrapped at about from 10 percent to about 60 percent of the time required for comparable wax containing chewing gums.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
International Application No. PCT/US92/11317, filed on 
December 30, 1992, which in turn is a continuation-in-part 
of International Application No. PCT/US92/09615, 
filed on November 6, 1992, which in turn is a 
continuation-in-part of PCT/US92/01686, filed on March 3, 
1992. The present invention relates to an improved 
chewing gum of the type which does not contain wax, and 
to certain wax-free chewing gum products having an 
initial soft bite as measured by a Taber Stiffness Test 
(Taber Units) and by Instron yield data. The gum also 
has excellent tempering times, a good surface toughness 
and can be produced more quickly than comparable wax 
containing gums. U.S. Patent 3,984,574, issued to Comollo, 
discloses an abhesive chewing gum base in which the non-tack 
properties were achieved by eliminating conventional 
chewing gum base ingredients which were found to 
contribute to chewing gum tackiness, and by substituting 
non-tacky ingredients in place of the conventional 
ingredients. Specifically, it was discovered that three  
 
classes of materials account for conventional chewing gum 
tackiness. These materials are elastomers, resins, and 
waxes. Comollo eliminated natural and some synthetic 
elastomers from chewing gum base, and substituted in 
their place one or more non-tacky synthetic elastomers 
such as polyisobutylene, polyisoprene, isobutylene-isoprene 
copolymer and butadiene-styrene copolymer. 
Comollo also eliminated the tack-producing natural resins 
and modified natural resins and used instead relatively 
high amounts of hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated 
vegetable oils or animal fats. Finally, Comollo 
completely excluded waxes from the gum base, but included 
polyvinylacetate, fatty acids, and mono and diglycerides 
of fatty acids. Comollo provided no information relating 
to the relationship of initial soft bite and toughness. In US-A-5023093, there is disclosed a 
chewing gum base with reduced calorie content. The 
central components of that gum base are 10-25% 
polyvinyl acetate having a medium molecular weight of 
about 35,000 to 55,000, 4.5% to about 10% acetylated 
monoglyceride. In GB-2241957 there is described a method by 
which the chicle or jelutong content and water are 
separated from a tree sap containing said components 
and other natural resins such as rubber hydrocarbons. 
Examples of gum bases incorporating said components 
are given which include microcrystal and wax.  
 The present invention is directed to 
impr
