<ABSTRACT>
The upper surface (1) of the mattress proposed has an approximately plane central section (6), designed to support the chest and stomach of a person lying on the mattress, plus, in a head section (10), a sunken area with a rest (9) for the forehead. Extending across the mattress between the head section (10) and the central section (6) is a transverse recess (7). On the feet side of the central section (6) is a hollow (11) designed to accomodate the legs. This mattress design ensures a comfortable position and unrestricted breathing when lying on the stomach.

Air mattress with a top surface (1), an approximately 
plane bottom surface (2), a face (3) on the head side, 

a face (4) on the foot side and two lateral sides (5), 
wherein 


the top surface has spaced apart from both end 
faces an approximately plane central section (6) which 

runs approximately parallel to the bottom surface (2) 
for resting the chest and stomach of a person in lying 

position; 
adjoining the central section towards the head 
side a recess (7) runs transversely between the two 

lateral sides; 
adjoining the recess towards the head side a rest 
area (9) is arranged for the forehead of a lying 

person, the spacing from the bottom surface of which 
is greater than the spacing of the base of the recess 

from the bottom surface characterised in that, 
the spacing of the rest area (9) from the bottom 
surface (2) is smaller than the spacing of the central 

section (6) from the bottom surface (2); 
adjoining the rest area (9) towards the head side 
there extends an end section (10), the spacing from 

the bottom surface (2) of which at least corresponds 
to that of the central section (6) from the bottom 

surface (2); and 
adjoining the central section (6) towards the 
foot side a hollow (11) extends partway the width of 

the air mattress for the accommodation of the legs of 
a person lying, whereby the foot side end of the 

hollow (11) has a spacing from the bottom surface (2) 
which approximately corresponds to that of the central 

section (6). 
Air mattress according to claim 1, characterised in 
that, the rest area (9) is formed as an arc-formed 

depression of the end section (10). 
Air mattress according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that, the top surface (1) has one lateral section 

(12) respectively on each of the two sides of the 
hollow (11), which section has approximately the same 

spacing from the bottom surface (2) as the central 
section (6). 
Air mattress according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that, the central section (6) 

neighbouring the two lateral sides (5) is sloped 
towards the recess (7). 
Air mattress according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that, the recess (7) is closed on 

both sides with a bridge (14) which extends 
approximately to the height of the rest area (9). 
Air mattress according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that, the recess (7) is closed on 

both sides with a bridge (14), the height of which 
extends from the bottom surface (2) to the top surface 

(1). 
Air mattress according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that, the hollow (11) has one depth 

(16) over its entire length, whereby this depth (16) 
approximately corresponds to the spacing of the base 

(8) of the recess (7) from the top surface (6).
