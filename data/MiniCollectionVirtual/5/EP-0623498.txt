<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a loading device for load carriers, in particular for standardised interchangeable containers or pallets which can be used for the loading surfaces of lorries or waggons, the said invention having lifting, centering and/or fixing devices for the positionally accurate placing of the load carrier on the vehicle (F) or its loading surface (7). The loading device comprises a drivable lifting device with a horizontal support frame (3) which can be moved vertically by means of at least two rockers (21), the loading device having means for holding the support frame (3) horizontal during its vertical movement and means for horizontally displacing the load carrier on the support frame (3). Special guide devices and centering devices ensure exact vertical lifting of the support frame (3) and positioning of the load carrier after the latter has been picked up from the support frame (3). In a railway train all the loading devices can be coupled to one another so that a multiplicity of load carriers can be picked up and centered simultaneously.
