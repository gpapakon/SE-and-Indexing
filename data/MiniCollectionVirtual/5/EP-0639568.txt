<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to therapeutically active piperidine compounds, 
a method of preparing the same and to pharmaceutical compositions 
comprising the compounds. The novel compounds are useful in the 
treatment of anoxia, traumatic injury, ischemia, migraine, epilepsy, Parkinson's 
disease, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. It is well known that accumulation of calcium in the brain cells (calcium 
overload) is seen after periods of uncontrolled hyperactivity in the brain, 
such as after convulsions, migraine, anoxia and ischemia. As the concentration 
of calcium in the cells is of vital importance for the regulation of cell 
function, and uncontrolled high concentration of the cell calcium will lead to, 
or indirectly cause the symptoms and possibly also the degenerative 
changes combined with the above diseases. Therefore, calcium overload blockers selective for brain cells will be useful 
in the treatment of anoxia, traumatic injury, ischemia, migraine, epilepsy, 
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative 
diseases. Well known calcium antagonists such as nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem 
have activity against peripheral calcium uptake, e.g. in blood vessels and 
the heart, however, they have shown only very low activity against calcium 
overload in brain cells. Accordingly it is an object of the invention to provide novel compounds 
having activity against calcium overload in brain cells.  The novel compounds of the invention are of formula I 
wherein
 
A is 
or - O - R⁴
 
wherein R² and R³ independently are hydrogen, straight or branched C₁₋₆-alkyl 
optionally substituted with an amino group which amino group is 
optionally mono or disubstituted with straight or branched C₁₋₆-alkyl, straight 
or branched C₂₋₆-alkenyl or straight or branched C₂₋₆-alkynyl; or
 
R² and R³ together form a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic ring containing 
one to four N, O or S atom(s) or a combination thereof which heterocyclic 
ring is optionally substituted at a carbon or nitrogen atom with straight or 
branched C₁₋₆-alkyl, straight or branched C₂₋₆-alkenyl, straight or branched 
C₂₋₆-alkynyl or phenyl which phenyl group is optionally substituted with 
halogen, C₁₋₄-alkyl, C₁₋₄-alkoxy or trifluoromethyl, or one or two carbon 
atom(s) in the heterocyclic ring together with one or two oxygen atom(s) 
form one or two carbonyl group(s), or which heterocyclic ring is optionally 
fused with a benzo group; and
 
R⁴ is straight or branched C₁₋₆-alkyl optionally
