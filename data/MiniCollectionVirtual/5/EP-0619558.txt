<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for classifying signal configurations operating via successive dichotomies. The method comprises a learning phase intended to structure a classifying apparatus with treelike structure adapted to specific classifying tasks. This learning phase is undertaken on a trio or a combination of trios of classifying means. A trio comprises a first classifying means formed by a binary separator (N1) followed by two classifying means (C1, C2) which may themselves be binary separators or advanced classifiers. The learning phase is conducted globally on the three classifying means of a trio by provisionally attributing probabilities of success to each second classifying means. By adding successive trios, for which individal learning is carried out with each trio, a classifying apparatus with treelike structure is thereby generated. Application: character and phoneme recognition, classification of signal configurations.

<CLAIMS>
A method for the classification of signal patterns by successive
dichotomies, comprising a learning phase which is performed on a batch of examples of

signal patterns, said examples being classified by a trio of classification means or by a
combination of several trios of classification means, said trio or each of said trios being

formed by a first binary separation means (N1-N5) which is followed by two second
classification means (C1-C6), said first means distributing signal patterns to the second

classification means, the learning phase comprising the following steps:

A- interactive calculation, for said trio or each of said trios of respective
adaptive parameters of said first means and said second means so as to distinguish, at

the output of said second means, two respective classifications by minimizing an error
criterion,
B- freezing the parameters of the first means when at least one of said
second means does not provide a classification with an expected homogeneity, and

replacing each second means which does not provide a homogeneous classification by
an additional trio of classification means,
C- repeating the above steps for each additional trio until all second
classification means supply respective classifications with the expected homogeneities,
D- freezing the respective parameters of all trios of classification means.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that for the interactive
calculation of the adaptive parameters of a said trio, the method comprises the following

steps:

estimating, for each first means and for each signal pattern, a probability
concerning one of the binary classifications and a complementary probability concerning

the other binary classification,
calculating, for each second means and for each signal pattern, a success
rate relating a result supplied by said second means and the relevant probability,
calculating an overall result for the trio, grouping the success rate of the
two second classification means, 
comparing the overall result of the trio with an overall result of expected
homogeneity and determining an error measuring the gaps stemming from this

comparison,
minimizing the error by modifying the adaptive parameters of the first
means and those of the second means for the entire batch of examples.
A method as claimed in one of the Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the
method is applied conjunctively to two trios (L1, D1, D2) (L2, D3, D4) of

classification means, the two first binary separation means (L1, L2) being preceded by a
preliminary binary separation means (L0) for distributing the signal patterns to the two

said first means, said preliminary means having adaptive parameters, the learning phase
being applied generally to said two trios and to the preliminary means so as to enable

classifications having the expected homogeneities due to adaptation of the adaptive
parameters, to be distinguished at the output of said second means.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the first binary
separation means are neurons.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the second
classification means are radial base function classifiers, nearest-neighbour classifiers, or

approximation function classifiers.
