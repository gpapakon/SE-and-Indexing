<ABSTRACT>
In a continuous casting process for steel, a molten core 
inside a strand is stalled at a specific point Q in a pass line 

of the strand to form a cored portion including no molten steel 
in the strand downstream of the specific point Q, and the cored 

portion is rolled by a pair of rolls under pressing into a solid 
strand in the latter half of a strand drawing stroke. The resulting 

solid strand comprises a skin formed of a chill crystal and 
the interior formed of a columnar crystal by addition of proper 

casting temperature. A through continuous casting/rolling process 
in which the above improved continuous casting process is combined 

with a subsequent hot rolling process is also disclosed. A 
drastic increase in the casting efficiency, an improvement in 

quality, and an equipment capable of freely adjusting a casting 
thickness can be resulted so that direct coupling between continuous 

casting and rolling is achieved and near-net-shaping of 
various steel materials is promoted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a continuous casting process
for steel according to the preambles of the independent claims
1 and 5 as well as to a continuous casting/rolling process
according to claim 8.More
particularly, the present invention relates to development of a
continuous casting process which can drastically increase casting
efficiency and can improve quality of strands, and a combination of
the continuous casting process with hot rolling to provide a
continuous casting/rolling process which can successively produce
hot-rolled steel from continuous casting in a through process.With a view of tremendously reducing the production cost
of hot-rolled steel, a method of directly coupling a continuous
casting (hereinafter referred to as c.c.) line and a hot rolling
line is proposed on the one side, and a method of modifying the
c.c. process, which is originally regarded to be closer to the
near-net-shaping process than the ingot making, so as to become
even closer to near-net-shaping is researched on the other side.Both the above methods are not contradictory to each
other, but have common objects and common technical
problems. The unison of the two methods will be an optimum production 
system. This system has already reached in part a level
of the actual production for low-grade hot coils, but has faced
difficulties for medium- and high-grade hot coils and other steel
materials (such as angles, flat bars, bars and wire rods.)Two typical and important technical problems relating to
achievement of direct coupling and near-net-shaping will be
described below. The problems incidental to the actual operation
are not of course limited to thereto, but those two problems are
at least be settled before.In a conventional c.c. process, particularly in a curved
type c.c. process with which a strand is drawn right below from a
mold and then further drawn while being curved, the casting
efficiency per strand is about a half or a quarter of the efficiency of
succeeding rolling even for billets, blooms and slabs. Therefore,
simple mechanical coupling between the upstream c.c. line and the
downstream rolling line is very inefficient. Alternatively, if
hot billets, blooms and slabs are immediately transferred to be
rolled from multi-strand c.c., the efficiency would be balanced,
but the direct coupling effect would be greatly sacrificed.On the other hand, it has been attempted to increase the
cross section of a strand or the metallurgical length for the
purpose of improving the efficiency of c.c. However, the
