<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing brushes, in particular toothbrushes, in which firstly a brush body (1) of thermoplastic is injection-moulded, which has a given number and arrangement of continuous brush holes (11) in the region of the brush head to be formed and a cutout on the back extending at least over all the brush holes (11), in which subsequently prepared bristle tufts (7) are inserted in all the tuft holes (11), and in which finally the previously formed cutout is injection-filled with further plastic, characterised in that the preformed brush body (1), provided with tuft holes and a cutout on the back, is fed from the injection-mould to a separate bristle insertion station, at which the prepared bristle tufts (7) are inserted and melted at their inner ends, and in that the brush body fitted with bristles is subsequently moved into a further injection-mould for injection-filling of the cutout.

Method for the production of brushes, especially 
toothbrushes, in which firstly a brush body (1) is 

injection moulded from thermoplastic plastic, which in 
the region of the brush head (2) to be formed has a 

preset number and arrangement of piercing brush holes, 
characterised in that a rearward recess (17) extending 

at least over all of the brush holes is provided in 
which subsequently prepared bundles of bristles (7) 

are inserted into all of the bundle holes (11) and in 
which finally the previously formed recess (17) is 

filled out by injection with further plastic, the 
prefabricated brush body (1) provided with bundle 

holes (11) as well as with a rearward recess (17) 
being fed from the injection mould (4) to a separate 

bristle-fitting station in which the prepared bundles 
of bristles (7) are inserted and fused at their inner 

ends, and that the brush body (1) fitted with bristles 
is subsequently moved into a further injection mould 

(16) for filling out the recess (17) by injection. 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the individual bundles of bristles (7) are configured 

in the bristle-fitting station. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the bristle ends on the usage side of the individual 

bundles of bristles (7) are rounded off in the 
bristle-fitting station. 
Method according to at least one of the Claims 1 - 3,
 
characterised in that
 
the prepared bundles of bristles (7) are inserted into  

 
the bundle holes (11) from the bristle area of the 

brush head (1). 
Method according to at least one of the Claims 1 - 3,
 
characterised in that
 
the prepared bundles of bristles (7) are inserted into 

the bundle holes (11) from the rearward side of the 
bristle area of the brush head (1). 
Method according to Claim 4,
 
characterised in that
 
bundles of bristles (7) formed by folding are inserted 

into the bundle holes (11). 
Method according to at least one of the Claims 1 - 6,
 
characterised in that
 
the bundles of bristles (7) are inserted directly into 

the bundle holes (11). 
Method according to at least one of the Claims 1 - 6,
 
characterised in that
 
the bundles of bristles (7) are inserted into an 

intermediate plate and only from the same into the 
bundle holes (11). 
Method according to at least one of the Claims 1 - 8,
 
characterised in that
 
the recess (17) of the brush body (1) is filled out by 

injection with a plastic different from the brush 
body. 
Method according to at least one of the Claims 1 - 9,
 
characterised in that
 
the recess (17) extends wholly or in part up to the 

edge of the brush body (1). 
Method according to at least one of the Claims 1 - 10,
  
 

characterised in that
 
the recess (17) extends wholly or at least in part 

into the neck (3) or handle of the brush.
