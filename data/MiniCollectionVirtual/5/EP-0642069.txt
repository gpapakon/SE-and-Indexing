<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a regulation device having a controller (12, 12') which is connected to at least one actual value transmitter (7, 30, 36), a desired value transmitter (40) and an actuator (14/15/17) and a control path. In order to improve the control behaviour, it is provided that a fuzzy controller (10, 10') is arranged in the desired value path (43) of the controller (12, 12'). In a method for regulating the process water discharge temperature of a circulating water heater, it is for example ensured, by means of a fuzzy controller acting as logical coupling element, that before changing over the circulating water heater from hot water to process water tapping operation at high forward flow temperature, the output signal of the logical coupling element is kept small, or vice versa.

Process for controlling the service water outlet temperature of a closed-circuit
water heater having a burner (17) controlled by a proportional gas

valve (15) and serving as an actuating element, and further having a secondary
heat exchanger (29), a conventional controller (12, 12') and a fuzzy

controller (10, 10') arranged in the setpoint path (43) of the said conventional
controller (12, 12'), such fuzzy controller (10, 10') being provided with a

service water outlet temperature sensor as a first actual-value detector
(36), a first setpoint selector (40) for the desired service water outlet temperature,

a second actual-value detector (7) for the upstream temperature
and, if required, with further detectors for essential disturbance variables,

especially an input device (63) for information on the characteristics of the
conventional controller (12, 12'), moreover with a third actual-value detector

(30) for the temperature in the interior of the secondary heat exchanger
(29), and a selector for the equipment power rating, with such fuzzy controller

making a selection of the essential current disturbance variables and
effecting a linkage of the same in accordance with preset relation-ships,


characterized in that
 prior to switching the closed-circuit water heater
from heating operation to service water tapping operation the output signal

of the fuzzy controller (10, 10') is held low if the upstream temperature is
high, and vice versa. 
Process as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the output signal of
the fuzzy controller (10, 10') is high if the setpoint value for the service

water temperature is high, and vice versa.
Process as claimed in any of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 the
output signal of the fuzzy controller (10, 10') is low if there is a great difference

between the actual upstream temperature and the actual service
water outlet temperature and if the equipment has a high power rating, and

vice versa.
Process as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the output
signal of the fuzzy controller (10, 10') is low if there is a small difference

between the actual upstream temperature and the actual service
water outlet temperature, and vice versa.
Process as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the output
signal of the fuzzy controller (10, 10') is high if there is a great difference

between the actual reservoir temperature of the secondary heat
exchanger (29) and the actual service water outlet temperature, and vice

versa.
Process as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the
output signal of the fuzzy controller (10, 10') is high if there is a great

difference between the actual upstream temperature and the actual
reservoir tempe-rature of the secondary heat exchanger (29) and if the

equipment has a low power rating, and vice versa. 
Process as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the output
signal of the fuzzy controller (10, 10') is high if the actual upstream

temperature is changing rapidly, the equipment has a low power rating and
if there is a great difference between the setpoint upstream temperature

and the actual upstream temperature, and vice versa.
Process as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the output
signal of the fuzzy controller (10, 10') is high if the difference between

the setpoint service water outlet temperature and the actual upstream
temperature is positive, and vice versa.
Process as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the output
signal of the fuzzy controller (10, 10') is low if there is a small control

deviation of the service water outlet temperature and if the actual service
water outlet temperature is changing rapidly, and vice versa.
Process as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the output
signal of the fuzzy controller (10, 10') is at a medium level if there is a

small control deviation of the service water outlet temperature and the
actual service water outlet temperature is changing slowly.
