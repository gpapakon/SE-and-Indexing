<ABSTRACT>
Improved apparatus for rotary printing of a strip of 
paper (1) or similar material, comprising a printing 

roller (2) provided with a cliche" (3) brought into 
contact with a back pressure roller (4) and a screened 

roller (5) to quickly interrupt and resume the printing of 
the paper (1), said means comprising a support (20) to 

which the printing roller (2) is rotatingly connected and 
which is, in turn, rotatingly connected to a fixed pivot 

(21) eccentric with respect to the printing roller (2) and 
around which rotation occurs by means of an actuator (22). 

Washing means (15) are also provided for the cliche' (3) 
and a mobile support (30) of the ink roller (6) which 

allows it to be distanced from the screened roller (5) so 
as to create a space (8) which promotes the formation of a 

film of ink on the screened roller (5) itself suitable to 
keep it damp and prevent drying.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the field
of printing apparatuses and more precisely it relates to
an improved apparatus for continuous rotary typographic
printing, in particular suitable for high speed and
intermittent printing.In existing printing apparatuses, in particular
those of a rotary typographic type, the material to be
printed, normally a continuous strip of paper, is brought
into contact with a printing roller supporting a cliche'
on which the portions which print the signs or characters
on the paper are raised. The paper is pressed against the
cliche' of the printing roller by a pressure roller and
the cliche', before entering in contact with the paper to
be printed on, is dampened with ink on the raised
portions.According to printing techniques which at present
are consolidated and improved, the cliche' is dampened
with ink directly by an ink roller which dips in rotation
in the ink and comes into contact with an intermediate
roller, called a "screened" roller, which is able to hold
only a quantity of ink sufficient to dampen one pass of
the cliche' on the paper. The ink is spread uniformly on
the intermediate roller thanks to its screened surface
against which the ink roller engages by pressing along a
common generatrix. The pressure between the ink roller
and the screened roller determines the quantity of ink
which remains on the latter, more specifically inside the
very thickly-woven screen on its surface.Rotary printing is used for producing a large number
of identical pages corresponding to the cliche' used. At
the conclusion of printing, or at a break in printing, the
printing roller is disengaged from the pressure roller and
from the screened roller in order to make the substitution
of the cliche' possible. The means for disengagement are 
normally manually or automatically operated sliding means,
and they set into motion a slow translation. The cliche'
are commonly made of copper, zinc, or flexible plastic
material, and in this last case, the corresponding
printing is called flexography.For some types of printing, for example in the case
of data printers, the problem of being able to associate
the data printer with an intermittent typographic printer,
superimposing the print of the latter on the former, on
the same sheets of paper, is strongly felt. In fact, data
are normally printed on paper by means of a laser printer
or the like which is very suitable to the printing of
characters varying from one sheet to the next. Currently,
data is superimposed on a second printing

<CLAIMS>
Rotary typographic printing apparatus for a
strip (1) of paper and similar materials, in particular

suited for high speed and intermittent printing,
comprising a printing roller (2) holding a cliche' (3), for

example of a flexographic type, said strip (1) passing
between a pressure roller (4) and said printing roller(2),

the latter being dampened with ink by a screened roller
(5) which is, in turn, in contact with an ink roller (6)

partially dipped in an ink well (7), said printing roller
comprising means for its disengagement from said pressure

roller (4) and said screened roller (5) at the completion
of a printing phase, characterized in that said means of

disengagement comprise a first support (20) to which said
printing roller (2) is rotatingly connected and which is

rotatingly connected to a fixed pivot (21) eccentric with
respect to said printing roller(2), said first support

(20) being connected to an actuator (22) of rotation
around said fixed pivot (21), a second mobile support (30)

on fixed guides (33)
being also

provided to which said ink
roller (6) is rotatingly connected (32) so that the space

(8) existing with respect to said screened roller (5) can
be varied, the latter being able to be dampened to a

greater degree with the ink (7) in case of long breaks in
printing, means (15) being provided for washing said

printing roller (2) in case of long breaks.
Printing apparatus according to claim 1,
wherein said washing means (15) comprises a support (16)

provided with translation means (19) for said printing
roller as well as sprayers (17) and means (18) for

collection and recirculation of the washing water.
