<ABSTRACT>
In a probe element for coordinate measurement systems which use micro probes (2) and piezo-resonators (3, 4, 5) whose resonance characteristics change when the probe is touched, the probe element comprises piezo-resonators (3, 4, 5) configured in a polygonal pattern on which micro-probes (2) are mounted in a polygonal pattern and trace inner and outer surface contours in various coordinates. Contact between the micro probes (2) and the surface of the sample is detected by measuring the changes in the resonance characteristics of the piezo-resonators (3, 4, 5).
