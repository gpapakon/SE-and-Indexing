<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to detergent compositions for fabric cleaning
and more especially to high density granular detergent compositions
comprising one or more surfactant-containing particulate components.Granular detergent compositions containing linear alkyl benzene
sulfonate salts are well known in the art and are in widespread
commercial use. Conventionally the linear alkyl benzene sulfonate salt
forms part of a surfactant mixture in association with one or more
other anionic or nonionic surfactants. The former dissolves readily in
water over a wide range of temperatures and, at ambient i.e. cool water
temperature may aid solubilisation of any of the other anionic or
nonionic surfactants which are relatively water-insoluble.Concern has recently been expressed over the fate of linear alkyl
benzene sulfonates and their biodegradation products in the
environment. Of particular concern is the persistence in surface water
of certain di-alkyl tetralin compounds which are found as impurities in
commercial supplies of linear alkyl benzene sulfonates. Interest has
therefore increased in the use of alternatives to alkyl benzene
sulfonates as major components of detergent products.Examples of primary anionic or nonionic surfactants that are readily
biodegradable and which could replace the alkyl benzene sulfonate
component either partially or in toto include alkyl sulfate salts, alkane
sulfonate salts, alkyl methyl ester sulfonate salts and polyhydroxy fatty
acid amides. However, where the alkyl benzene sulfonate forms part 
of a mixture with such primary anionic or nonionic surfactants in a
granular component of a high density detergent composition, its
removal gives rise to a major change in the physical properties of that
granular component. The principal effect is to make the granule
hydrophobic in character, with a consequential decrease in its rate of
dissolution, particularly in water of temperatures <40Â°C.This hydrophobicity can be utilised to advantage where the granule
forms part of a laundry detergent product introduced into an
automatic washing machine through a dispensing drawer, and the
commonly assigned copending European Application Publication No.
0342043 seeks protection for a product having such characteristics.However, the excessive hydrophobicity of any granular components has
been found to lead to unacceptable dissolution characteristics for a
concentrated high-density detergent product, i.e. one of density
>550g/litre, containing such components as a significant fraction.
