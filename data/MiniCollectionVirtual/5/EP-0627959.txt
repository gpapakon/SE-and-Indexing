<ABSTRACT>
A method of conducting a continuous multi-phase catalytic reaction such as the conversion of syngas to higher hydrocarbon fuels. Gaseous reactants are introduced via a gas permeable plate (15) into a slurry (16) which includes the product and a finely divided catalyst. The liquid product is separated from the remainder of the slurry by means of a filter unit (13) including a filter member (22). A pressure differential is established across the filter member (22) by means of a constant level device (23) within the filter unit which maintains a level of filtrate (32) within the filter unit (22) below the level of the slurry (16). The slurry (16) is maintained in a constant state of agitation by the introduction of the gaseous components as a steam of bubbles. Fluctuations in the pressure differential across the filter member (22) prevent the filter member from clogging, and the gas space (28, 29) is above the filtrate (32) and the slurry (16) are in communication.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
conducting a continuous multi-phase catalytic reaction
and is particularly, though not exclusively, applicable
to the catalytic conversion of syngas, produced by the
reforming of methane, to hydrocarbon fuels, by a
Fischer-Tropsh type of synthesis. Other reaction
systems to which the method is applicable include
various slurry reactions for the production of
petrochemicals, the production of oxygenates from
synthesis gas and dehydrogenation reactions.Three-phase catalytic reaction systems are used in
a number of chemical processes and their application in
the petrochemical industry appears to be increasing. Of
the three-phase systems in use, mechanically agitated,
loop and bubble column slurry reactors contain small
catalyst particles dispersed in the liquid. In most
applications, the liquid will have to be separated
from the slurry to remove liquid products or for
catalyst regeneration purposes. In those cases where
the liquid is an inert medium, occasionally, it may
have to be replaced due to degradation or the build-up
of impurities.Mechanically agitated slurry reactors are
particularly convenient for batch process due to the
low mass-transfer and heat resistance. These features
also make them suitable for the determination of
reaction kinetics in the laboratory. A serious
disadvantage and limitation of this reactor type, 
however, is the difficulty in the separation of
catalyst particles in any continuous operation.Commercially, it is only mechanically agitated
reactors that are used in the hydrogenation of double
bonds in oils from cottonseed, soybean, corn, sunflower
etc. By employing a nickel catalyst, the products
include margarine, shortening, soap and greases. The
choice of reactor is based on the low diffusivities and
high viscosities of the fatty oils. Fixed-bed
operation has been proposed due to the advantage of
completely catalyst-free products without filtration.
A number of other hydrogenation reactions are also
carried out in agitated reactors, e.g. the
hydrogenation of nitrocompounds.The operation of bubble column slurry reactors is
simple, since mechanically moving parts are avoided.
Combined with the low diffusional resistance and
efficient heat transfer, these reactors are attractive
for many industrial processes. However, solid-liquid
separation is usually performed outside the reactor in
elaborate filtering and settling systems. The catalyst
slurry is to be recycled to the reactor, sometimes with
the use of a slurry pump. Thus, serious

least one liquid component and the catalyst is a finely
