<ABSTRACT>
A procedure for preventing a reduction of flexibility in a material containing vinyl chloride after ageing at high temperature, a thermoplastic material and an application of this material. A polymer mixture is used containing 20-100 weight % of a copolymer consisting of 80-99.9 weight % VCM and 0.1-10 weight % acrylate containing glycidyl, 0-80 weight % PVC and 0-80 weight % of other copolymers based on at least 70 % VCM. The material is specially suited for vehicle cables, hoses, seals and packings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a procedure for preventing the 
reduction of flexibility of a plasticised material containing 
vinyl chloride after ageing at high temperature, a thermoplastic 
material containing vinyl chloride and an application of this 
material. For individual areas of use such as, for example, for cables for 
application in the transport industry, one of the most important 
requirements is that the cable retain as much of its flexibility 
as possible after ageing at warm temperatures. According to the 
French standard for vehicle cables, NFR 13-415, a cable must 
tolerate fatigue tests carried out at -25°C after thermal ageing. 
For a type 3 cable in accordance with this standard, which is 
used in the engine room, among other places, the thermal ageing 
is carried out at 155°C for 240 hours. According to Volvo's standard STD 7611,13 class 3, a cable must 
be able to withstand ageing at 170°C for 6 hours, and at 120°C 
for 1000 hours and then pass a cold bending test at -30°C. It is thus important that the cables retain as much of their 
flexibility as possible after ageing. This is emphasised by the 
fact that the more flexibility a cable retains after ageing, the 
more rigid it can be made, which is of advantage for many of the 
other tests within the scope of the standard, such as, for 
example, the deformation test under heat, resistance to chemicals 
and resistance to wear. It is difficult to find insulating materials which satisfy these 
requirements and the requirements of other standards for 
flexibility after ageing at a reasonable price and which do not 
require additional processing.  
 Polyvinyl chloride is a material which is easy to process and is relatively reasonably priced. 
However, PVC materials which are exposed to ageing at high temperature become more brittle 
on account of the fact that the material is broken down combined with a reduction in 
plasticiser. The loss of plasticiser means that there is a certain connection between the weight 
loss and the flexibility. European patent No. 0 264 916 discloses the use of vinyl chloride copolymers in magnetic 
coatings. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) may be included in the copolymer if improved thermal 
stability is desired. The material does not contain plasticiser. In contrast to this, the main 
feature according to our invention is to maintain the flexibility in a plasticised system, which 
means that the loss of plasticiser is reduced. The method according to our invention relates to 
a better flexibility after heat
