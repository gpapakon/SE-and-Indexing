<ABSTRACT>
A breast prosthesis (1) made from a material which in its consistency and flexibility approximates natural breast tissue, preferably a shell-shaped body made from a flexible-set, additively cross-linking two-component silicone-rubber substance and welded into plastic foils, is connected near its edge (5), at least in places, to a holding strip (3) which has a permanently adhesive layer (4) for attachment to the breast of the bearer, and to form a longer-lasting attachment, the connection (4) is situated only in the central area of the holding strip (3).

<CLAIMS>
Prosthesis, being a breast prosthesis made of a 
material which in terms of its consistency and mobility 

is similar to the natural breast tissue, the breast 
prosthesis preferably comprising a cup-shaped article 

which is made of a nonrigid, addition-crosslinking 2-component 
silicone rubber composition and which is welded 

into plastic films, and a support strip (3), the breast 
prosthesis in its edge area being connected at least in 

places to the support strip (3) via a connection (4, 9), 
which support strip (3) is provided with a permanently 

adhesive layer for securing it on the user's breast, and 
the connection (4, 9) being located only in the middle 

area of the support strip (3), characterized in that the 
connection (4, 9) is nonreleasable. 
Prosthesis according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the connection comprises connection spots (9) which 

are arranged at a distance from one another. 
Prosthesis according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the support strip (3) is provided 

with convexly curved edge areas (10) on its side directed 
away from the user's breast. 
Prosthesis according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that this is provided on its reverse 

side with an indentation (8) into which a masking cushion 
(2) of fibrous and/or textile material is inlaid, which 

masking cushion (2) at at least one point passes through 
the connection between the prosthesis edge (5) and the 

support strip (3). 
Prosthesis according to Claim 4, characterized in  
 

that the masking cushion (2) is provided with a 
continuation (6) which passes through the gap between the 

prosthesis edge and the support strip (3) in the middle, 
lower area of the support strip (3). 
Prosthesis according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that the inner edge of the support strip 

(3) engages at least partially over the edge of the 
masking cushion (2).
