<ABSTRACT>
In a device for active acoustic sound compensation of disturbing sound in cavities of a motor vehicle, having a sensor which supplies a sensor signal which essentially corresponds to the disturbing sound and whose output is connected to an input of an adaptive digital filter unit, and having a sound transmitter, which is connected downstream of the adaptive digital filter unit, for the generation of a compensating sound, an amplitude smoothing unit is interconnected between the output of the sensor and the input of the adaptive digital filter unit, the amplitude smoothing unit producing essentially the same amplitude for each frequency component of the sensor signal.

<CLAIMS>
A device for active acoustic compensation of an interfering sound in cavities 
in a motor vehicle, comprising a sensor which delivers a signal substantially 

corresponding to the interfering sound and whose output is connected to an input 
of an adaptive digital filter unit, a sound generator for generating a compensating 

sound being disposed downstream of the adaptive digital filter unit, characterised 
in that an amplitude smoothing unit (1) is interposed between the output of the 

sensor (S1) and the input of the adaptive digital filter unit (4) and generates 
substantially the same amplitude for each frequency component of the sensor 

signal (x
1
). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the amplitude smoothing 
unit (1) substantially constructs the inverse autocorrelation function of the sensor 

signal (x
1
).
