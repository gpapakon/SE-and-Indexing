<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a platform for ladders (1). The platform has a tread (10) which can be pivoted about a vertical axis (5) running beside the ladder (1) between a position of use and a stand-by position, in which, in the position of use, the tread (10) lies in front of the rungs (3) of the ladder (1) and is swung away to the side in the stand-by position, and to a device for locking the tread (10) in the position of use and/or the stand-by position. The locking device has an actuating device which can be operated by the foot of a user standing above the tread (10) in order to release the locking device.

<CLAIMS>
Rest platform for a middle stringer ladder (1) whose 
middle stringer has a front open square or "C" profile, the 

rest platform comprising a tread surface (10) which can be 
swivelled about a vertical axis (5) running adjacent the 

ladder (1) between an operating position and a rest position 
so that, in the operating position, the tread surface (10) is 

located in front of the rungs (3) of the ladder (1) and, in 
the rest position, the tread surface (10) is swivelled away to 

the side, and a device for locking the tread surface (10) in 
the operating position and/or in the rest position, the 

locking device including an operating mechanism which can be 
operated by an operator standing over the tread surface (10) 

with the foot for releasing the locking, 

characterized
 in that the locking device for locking the 
operating position of the tread surface (10) is provided with 

an angle lever (15) having two lever arms (17, 18) and being 
articulated below the tread surface (10) so that the first 

lever arm (17) protrudes outwards with its free end (pedal 
plate 21) laterally beyond the tread surface (10) so that it 

can be reached at its free end by the operator with the foot 
and with a locking bolt (19) being provided at the free end of 

the second lever arm (18) which, in the rest position of the 
angle lever (15), engages in the opening (8) of the square or 

"C" profile and which is released from this opening (8) when 
the angle lever (15) is swivelled out of its rest position by 

the operation of the free end (pedal plate 21) of the first 
lever arm (17). 
Rest platform according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the locking device is provided with a catch  

 
mechanism for locking the rest position of the tread surface 

(10) with the catch mechanism having a catch (22) which can be 
operated with the foot. 
Rest platform according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized
 in that at least one tread extension (14) 
protrudes forwards from the tread surface (10) and rests on a 

rung (3) in the operating position.
