<ABSTRACT>
An endothermic reaction furnace (102) includes one or more elongated tubes (110) defining therein an endothermic reaction flow path and a combustion flow path for providing heat to drive the endothermic reaction. The combustion flow path is arranged so that fuel and combustion air are separately heated by the heat inside the furnace (102) to significantly above their autoignition temperature before being combined in a combustion zone (116) where they mix, autoignite and burn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to endothermic reaction apparatus and use of
the apparatus in carrying out an endothermic reaction.US-A-1,934,836 discloses that in the process for the production of gases
containing hydrogen by the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons by steam at
elevated temperatures the catalysts may be arranged in externally heated long
chambers, the walls of which consist of a material of high heat conductivity which
is resistant to high temperatures. A reaction vessel similar to a tube boiler may be
employed and the contact substances may be arranged either within the tubes, in
which case a heating medium, for example hot combustion gases, is conducted
through the space surrounding the tubes, or vice versa. When using unactivated
catalysts, and in the case of very impure initial gases or vapours, it is beneficial to
work with the hydrocarbons and the heating medium in a counter current. When
employing activated catalysts it is best to pass the gases in the same direction as the
heating medium.US-A-4,224,298 discloses apparatus for the reforming of hydrocarbons
comprising a fluidised bed furnace housed in a pressure vessel able to withstand an
internal pressure in excess of 2.54 MPa (50 atmospheres) absolute, and
substantially vertical reformer tubes extending through, or located in, the zone
occupied by the fluidised bed in operation of the furnace.Our earlier published European Patent Application 0 450 872 A1,
corresponding to application USSN 07/504,375, filed April 3, 1990, describes an
endothermic reaction apparatus or furnace for carrying out various types of
endothermic reactions such as steam methane reforming, pyrolysis of ethane to
ethylene and the like. In order to drive the endothermic reaction, a heat source
comprising a ceramic combustion tube and a fuel feed pipe inside the combustion 
tube is positioned inside the furnace. Fuel and air, which are separately supplied to
the fuel feed pipe and combustion tube, respectively, mix, ignite and burn inside the
combustion tube to thereby generate heat. Endothermic reactants are fed to the
interior of the furnace outside of the combustion tube where they react due to the
heat produced inside the tube.
In a preferred embodiment, the endothermic reactant and product gases
(hereinafter "reaction gases"), on the one hand, and the combustion fuel, air and
combustion product gases (hereinafter "combustion gases"), on the other hand,
flow countercurrently through 
the furnace. By this means, the separately-fed combustion fuel and air
