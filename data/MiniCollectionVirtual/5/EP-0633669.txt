<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to a detection method according to the preamble of claim
1 for transmission of data in an electric power transmission network.The invention also concerns a detection apparatus for use in transmission of data
in an electric power transmission network.Such method and apparatus is disclosed in EP-A-0 254 846.Electric power transmission networks are nowadays utilized in the transmission of
data employed for the control and supervision of the network operation. Data
transmission today typically takes place via phase-modulated serial channels
having a carrier frequency of, e.g., 3025 Hz. Correspondingly, data transmission
rates in concurrent systems typically are 12.5 bit/s or 50 bit/s. This makes the
duration of a single symbol transmission equal to 80 or 20 ms, respectively.When transmitting, e.g., at 50 bit/s data transmission rate in a 50 Hz power
system, the harmonics of the power system fundamental frequency coincide with
the main lobe of the data signal power spectrum causing significant impairment of
the bit error rate. Obviously, the same problem occurs in a 60 Hz power system
when using a 60 bit/s data transmission rate. As increasing the data transmission
rate also increases the bandwidth of the signal main lobe in the signal power
spectrum, the higher data transmission rate also increases the number of harmonics
of power system fundamental frequency coinciding with the main lobe of the
signal power spectrum, which results in greater disturbance problems at higher
data transmission rates.Moreover, pink noise and a DC component in the signal to be detected cause
errors in the determination of symbol values from the detected signal. It is an object of the present invention to achieve an entirely novel type of
detection method and apparatus for transmission of data in an electric power
transmission network.The invention is based on performing the detection of a digital signal comprised
of n symbols by assuming the first symbol (or symbols) of a data sequence
known a priori and then integrating the symbols for the period duration of the
disturbance harmonic component, or some multiple thereof, and finally
determining the new symbol on the basis of the integration result and the
symbol(s) known a priori. The integration is performed n-j times for a data
sequence of n symbols, where j is the number of a priori known symbols. Hence,
according to the definition of the invention, the a priori known symbols are
included in the length of the data sequence. Additionally, the detected
