<ABSTRACT>
An information transfer 
apparatus includes a random access 

storage medium, request information 
input means connected to a 

removable information recording 
apparatus and information output 

means connected to the removable 
information recording apparatus, 

wherein information is read out 
at random from the recording 

medium on the basis of request 
information inputted through the 

request information input means, 
and it is output through the 

information output means. The 
information recording apparatus 

stores temporarily the information 
inputted through the information 

input means in the recording 
means, and then records it into the 

recording medium consisting of 
a plurality of recording medium 

pieces. Accordingly, even when the 
recording medium has a relatively 

low write speed, it can record the 
information correctly and at a high 

speed. The information transfer 
apparatus assumes versatile memory constructions, and sequentially transfers the stored information on the basis of 

the information transfer request signal requesting the information transfer from the information recording apparatus 
which records and reproduces the inputted information. The information recording apparatus executes recording 

control so that the inputted information is recorded in a plurality of recording medium pieces in a transverse sequence 
and in parallel. Accordingly, the information can be recorded in parallel by a simple control into a variety of 

information recording apparatuses constituted by recording media having various write times, and the information 
can be transferred at a high speed by using a simple hardware.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an information recording device
for recording, at a high speed, information into recording
media in which write speeds are not uniform, and describes an information
transfer system for transferring, at a high speed, information
to various information recording devices.The applicant of this invention has already proposed
information transfer means for transferring information at a high
speed from an information providing device to a recording
(reproducing) device in which semiconductor memory is included,
as described in the respective specifications and drawings of the
Tokuganhei No. 4-304706 (Japanese Patent Application No.
304706/1992) and tokuganhei No. 5-21729 (Japanese Patent
Application No. 21729/1993).JP 4268284 A discloses an information recording device comprising:
a plurality of recording medium pieces,information input means to which information is inputted,temporary recording means, andmeans for writing the information read out from the temporary recording means
into the plurality of recording medium pieces in parallel.In JP 3191450 A, the defective ratio of a memory card is reduced by including a
stand-by memory chip in the memory card, and if a defective chip exists, the
stand-by memory is substituted for the defective chip.In JP 5046489 A, a memory card is provided with a plurality of EEPROMs having
data area consisting in blocks each of them has the constant capacity and a relief
area and a control means writing data to be written in an erroneous block by
retrieving an idle block in the relief area while detecting a write error in the block of
the data area in this EEPROM.FIG. 19 shows appearance of information
recording/reproducing device 200 to which technology as described
above is applied. At this information recording/reproducing
device 200, information providing device connecting (coupling)
terminal 201 is provided. Trough this terminal, information can
be copied from information providing device of which indication
is omitted into recording medium provided within the information 
recording/reproducing device 200. Moreover, display means 202
and reproduction selector means 203 are equipped at this
information recording/reproducing device 200. The content of
information recorded in the recording medium within information
recording/reproducing device 200 can be displayed on display
means 202. Further, user of this device 200 can selectively
reproduce necessary information by using reproduction selector
means 203 such as push-button switch, etc. on the basis
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An information recording device (2) comprising:

information input means for receiving input
information;
temporary recording means (22) for temporarily recording
the input information; and
means for recording the input information on a
recording medium (31
1
, ..., 31
N
), thereby to temporarily store information
input through the information input means in the temporary

recording means and thereafter to record it in the recording
medium, wherein the temporary recording means has a higher

write speed than the recording medium, the recording medium
comprises a plurality of recording medium pieces (31
1
, ..., 31
N
), recording
into the plurality of recording medium p
ieces is carried out
in parallel, the information input means time-divides the

input information to record the divided information into the
plurality of recording medium pieces, and the times required

for recording into the respective recording medium pieces
vary from one to another of said recording medium pieces, so

that recording in at least one of said recording medium
pieces is sometimes not completed within a predetermined

time;
means for exceptional recording of information not
recorded within said predetermined time; and
recording information recording means (41) for recording
information about said exceptional recording.
The information recording device as set forth in
Claim 1, further comprising request information output means

for successively outputting request information of
information units of the input information, whereby the

information input means carries out input of information
units of the input information on the basis of the request

information.
The information recording device as set forth in 
Claim 2, wherein the information input means includes the

request information output means, and is operative to time-divide
an output of the request information and an input of

the input information.
