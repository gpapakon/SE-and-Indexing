<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel thiazolopyrimidine 
derivatives and salts thereof which exhibit antiangiogenic 
activity. The compounds are useful for treatment and cure of 
diseases, the development of which may be related to 
angiogenesis. Examples of such diseases include diabetic 
retinopathy, various chronic inflammation conditions, growth or 
metastasis of malignant solid tumors, rheumatism and psoriasis. The term "antiangiogenic" as used herein means having 
the activity of suppressing the formation of new blood vessels. 
Angiogenesis is related to several pathological conditions such 
as diabetic retinopathy, growth and metastasis of solid tumors, 
and various inflammation conditions including rheumatism, 
psoriasis and the like. Accordingly, research on antiangiogenic compounds has 
been undertaken and reported. Such reports include research 
on, for example, protamine (Nature, 297:307, 1982), a 
combination of heparin with cortisone acetate (Science, 
221:719, 1983), fumagillin and its derivatives, and the like. In addition, α-interferon is reported to have 
antiangiogenic activities and to act well on infantile lethal 
angiosarcoma.  However, these compounds were found to have problems 
with activity, maintenance of activity and side effects such as 
cytotoxicity, fever, bleeding and the like. An object of the invention is to provide novel 
compounds having excellent antiangiogenic activity. The present inventors have conducted extensive studies 
for the the purpose of obtaining compounds with more excellent 
activity and higher safety, and have found that 
thiazolopyrimidine derivatives exhibit excellent antiangiogenic 
characteristics. The present invention provides compounds represented by 
the following general formula 
wherein n represents an integer of 1 to 3;
 
R¹ and R² represent independently a hydrogen atom or an alkyl 
group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms;
 
R³ represents a hydroxyl group, an alkyl group having from 1 to 
12 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 6 carbon 
atoms, a halogenoalkylgroup having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a  
 
cyanoalkyl group having from 2 to 7 carbon atoms, an 
alkoxyalkyl group having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms, an 
alkoxycarbonylalkyl group having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, a 
carboxyalkyl group having from 2 to 7 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl 
group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a cycloalkoxyl group 
having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxyalkoxyl group having 
from 2 to 9 carbon atoms, an alkoxycarbonylalkoxyl group having 
from 3 to
