<ABSTRACT>
In a method for mixing two initial (precursor) solutions to give a working solution with exactly known mixing ratio, it is proposed to subject the two initial solutions to rough mixing in a first step with a mixing ratio in a predeterminable range then, in a second step, to determine the value of an internal parameter of the working solution, the value of which is known in the two initial solutions and is significantly different and, in the third step, to determine the exact mixing ratio of the working solution from the measured value of the internal parameter.

<CLAIMS>
A method for mixing two initial solutions to produce a 
calibrating solution with an accurately known value for at least 

one calibrating parameter, 
characterized in that
 the calibrating 
solution is produced by coarsely mixing the two initial solutions 

in a first step, the mixing ratio being within a predetermined 
range, and that the value of an internal parameter of the 

calibrating solution, which is independent of the calibrating 
parameter, is determined in a second step, the internal parameter 

being an inherent quantity of at least one of the initial 
solutions, whose value is known and differs significantly for the 

two initial solutions, and further that the exact mixing ratio of 
the initial solutions and the exact value of the calibrating 

parameter are determined from the value measured for the internal 
parameter in a third step. 
A method as in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the value 
measured for the internal parameter is employed as a controlling 

or adjusting variable for correcting the mixing ratio during 
coarse mixing. 
A method as in claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 at least 
one variable from the group of pH value and CO
2
 partial pressure 
of the calibrating solution is used as calibrating parameter.  

 
A method as in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 at 
least one ionic concentration of the calibrating solution is 

employed as calibrating parameter, i.e., preferably the 
concentration of Na
+
, K
+
, Li
+
, Ca

, Mg

, Cl

 ions. 
A method as in any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 at 
least one enzyme substrate concentration of the calibrating 

solution is employed as calibrating parameter, i.e., preferably 
the concentration of glucose, lactate, urea, or creatinine. 
A method as in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 
the conductivity or electrical resistance of the calibrating 

solution is measured as internal parameter. 
A method as in any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 
the optical transmission, optical absorption, or intrinsic 

luminescence of the calibrating solution is measured as internal 
parameter. 
A calibrating system for analyzers with a measuring chamber, 
which measuring chamber is provided with a device (10) for 

measuring the conductivity of sample and calibrating solutions 
delivered into the measuring chamber by means of a pump, 


characterized in that
 the calibrating system comprises two 
containers (1, 1') 
with different initial solutions, controlled  
 

valves (4, 4') being provided for coarse mixing of the initial 
solutions to produce a calibrating solution in a passage (3), and 

that the passage (3) can be connected to the device (10) for 
conductivity measurement, and further that an evaluation unit 

(18) is provided for calculation of the exact mixing ratio of the 
initial solutions and of the exact value of at least one 

calibrating parameter from the value measured for conductivity.

measurement of blood gases, electrolytes and/or enzyme 

substrates.
