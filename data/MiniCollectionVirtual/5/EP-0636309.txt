<ABSTRACT>
A regulated flow restrictor device 
particularly useful as a drip irrigation emitter 

includes a housing (20) having an inlet opening (23), an 
outlet opening (24) and a flow-restrictor passageway 

including baffles (28,29) defining clearances with the 
passageway walls, which clearances, by the displacement 

of a displaceable wall in the form of an eastomeric 
membrane (31), vary the resistance of the flow of a 

fluid through the passageway in response to variations 
in the pressure of the pressurized fluid. The clearances 

are of increasing height in the direction from one of 
the openings (23,24) towards the other of the openings 

(23,24) such that the clearances are sequentially closed 
with increasing pressure in the pressurized fluid to 

maintain a substantially uniform flow to and through the 
housing outlet opening (24) despite variations in the 

pressure of the pressurized fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a regulated flow 
restrictor device. The invention is particularly useful for 
drip irrigation emitters, and is therefore described below 
with respect to this application. Drip irrigation systems have come into widespread 
use for irrigating plants since they supply a minimum of 
water directly to the root region of the plants. Regulated 
emitters have also come into widespread use since they 
produce a fairly uniform output despite variations in the 
inlet pressure, and thereby enable drip irrigation lines to 
be of relatively long lengths and to be used over uneven 
terrain. Many techniques have been developed for regulating 
emitters. Some involve varying the cross-section of a 
labyrinth in response to changes in the inlet pressure; 
whereas others involve varying the cross-section of a 
control chamber or of an outlet port in response to changes 
in the inlet pressure. Another proposed technique, as 
described in Eckstein US Patent 5,111,996, varies the 
effective length of a labyrinth in response to changes in 
the outlet pressure. A drip irrigation as described in the preamble 
of claim 1 is known from EP-A-467 386. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel structure for a regulated flow restrictor device, and 
particularly for a drip irrigation emitter, which has a 
number of important advantages over the existing structures, 
as will be described more particularly below. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a regulated flow restrictor device particularly 
useful as a drip irrigation emitter, comprising: a housing 
having an inlet opening connectible to a source of 
pressurized fluid, an outlet opening, and a passageway 
including first and second opposed walls connecting the 
inlet opening to the outlet opening; one of the walls being  
 
displaceable towards and away from the other wall; and a 
plurality of baffles extending transversely of, and 
longitudinally spaced between, the first and second walls to 
define a flow-restrictor imposing a resistance to the flow 
of the fluid through the passageway; the baffles defining 
clearances with the passageway walls, which clearances, by 
the displacement of the displaceable wall, vary the 
resistance of the flow of the fluid through the passageway 
in response to variations in the pressure of the pressurized 
fluid; characterized in that the clearances are of 
increasing height in the direction from one of the openings 
towards the other of the openings such that the clearances 
are
