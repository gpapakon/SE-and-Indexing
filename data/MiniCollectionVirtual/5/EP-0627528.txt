<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a spreading apparatus (1) 
comprising a container (4) for spreadable granular material which 

is provided with an outlet which is closable with a 
controllable metering valve (9) and which connects to spreader 

members (10-12), a reservoir (13) for liquid wetting agent whereof an 
outlet (15) provided with a pump (16) is connected via a feed conduit 

(17) for wetting agent to the spreader members (10-12), wherein the feed 
conduit (17) forms a siphon (19) which extends above the filling level 

(20) of the reservoir (13) for liquid wetting agent and is provided 
with venting means (21) and connects via an open feed conduit end 

to the spreader members (10-12), and to a distribution chamber (27) 
therefor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spreading apparatus 
and to a distribution chamber therefor. The present invention 
relates more particularly to a spreading apparatus wherein 
granular material for spreading is made wet with a liquid 
wetting agent. The spreading of wettened spreadable material has the 
advantage that the wettened spreadable material adheres 
better and remains adhered to the place where it falls. It is 
thus possible for preventive spreading of a road surface to 
be carried out with wettened road salt, wherein the wettened 
road salt adheres to the road surface and is not blown away, 
while the forecast ice formation only occurs some time later. In spreading with wettened material it is essential 
that the supply of liquid wetting agent is adapted to the 
variable metering of spreadable granular material. In 
spreading of road salt the delivery is thus dependent on the 
speed of the vehicle on which the spreading apparatus is 
placed, which speed is measured with a measuring wheel which 
also serves to energize the hydraulic system. According to known prior art liquid wetting agent is 
supplied via a pump, wherein the flow rate of the pump 
depends on the delivery or metering of the spreadable 
granular material. In order to avoid the reservoir of liquid 
wetting agent draining through the pump it is necessary for 
the feed conduit which supplies wetting agent from the pump 
to the spreader members to be provided with a biased non-return 
valve which must have for instance an additional seat 
pressure of about 1.5 bar. The invention has for its object to provide a spreading 
apparatus not having the above stated drawback, which 
spreading apparatus is characterized for this purpose in that 
it comprises a container for spreadable granular material 
which is provided with an outlet which is closable with a 
controllable metering valve and which connects to spreader  
 
members, a reservoir for liquid wetting agent whereof an 
outlet provided with a pump is connected via a feed conduit 
for wetting agent to the spreader members, wherein the feed 
conduit forms a siphon which extends above the filling level 
of the reservoir for liquid wetting agent and is provided 
with venting means and connects via an open feed conduit end 
to the spreader members. Because the feed conduit is embodied as a siphon which 
extends above the filling level of the reservoir the pump, 
driven variably subject to the metering speed of spreadable 
material, only has to pump wetting agent up to this constant

<CLAIMS>
Spreading apparatus comprising a container for 
spreadable granular material which is provided with an outlet 

which is closable with a controllable metering valve and 
which connects to spreader members, a reservoir for liquid 

wetting agent whereof an outlet provided with a pump is 
connected via a feed conduit for wetting agent to the 

spreader members, wherein the feed conduit forms a siphon 
which extends above the filling level of the reservoir for 

liquid wetting agent and is provided with venting means and 
connects via an open feed conduit end to the spreader 

members. 
Spreading apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the pump is drivable with a variable, adequate flow rate and 

the feed conduit is provided with a controllable distribution 
chamber which, depending on the position of the metering 

valve, distributes the wetting agent over the feed conduit 
and over a return conduit which connects onto the reservoir 

for wetting agent. 
Spreading apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein 
the distribution chamber is located at a level above the 

filling level of the reservoir. 
Spreading apparatus as claimed in claims 1-3, 
wherein the distribution chamber comprises means for 

distributing the supplied volume of wetting agent, subject to 
the position of the metering valve, in a volume part for the 

feed conduit and a volume part for the return conduit. 
Spreading apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein 
the distribution chamber comprises a chamber with an inlet 

connected to the feed conduit and an adjustable partition 
wall which extends over the inlet aperture and adjustably 

divides the chamber into a chamber portion which connects to 
the feed conduit and a chamber portion which connects to the 

return conduit. 
Spreading apparatus as claimed in claim 4, wherein 
the distribution chamber comprises a feed chamber connected 

to the feed conduit, a return chamber connected to the return 
conduit, and a distribution dish which is provided with 

outlets and is rotatable in the distribution chamber and 
which forms a division between the feed chamber and the 

return chamber. 
Distribution chamber as claimed in claims 4-6.
