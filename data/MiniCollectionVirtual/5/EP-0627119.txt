<ABSTRACT>
A polarized relay includes a coil block having an elongated coil bobbin, a core inserted therein, and an excitation coil wound about the coil bobbin. The core has opposed pole ends projecting upwardly from longitudinal ends of the coil bobbin. A permanent magnet is interposed between the pole ends on the coil bobbin. Disposed on the coil block is an armature block which comprises an elongated generally flat armature and a set of movable springs carrying movable contacts. The movable springs are held together with the armature by means of an electrically insulating harness molded on the armature. The armature is pivotally supported on the coil block to be movable between two contact operating positions and constituting a magnetic circuit with the core and the permanent magnet for polarized operation of the armature. A terminal assembly is provided to include coil terminals leading to the excitation coil and fixed contact terminals provided respectively with fixed contacts at contact ends of the contact terminals. The polarized relay is characterized in that the coil block and the terminal assembly are molded together from an electrically insulating material into a single integral base unit on which the armature block is assembled with the movable contacts held in an engageable relation with the fixed contacts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a polarized relay, 
and more particularly to a polarized relay having an 
armature pivotally supported at its center to be swingable 
between two contact operating positions. Polarized relays having a swingable armature are well 
known in the art, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. 
Nos. 4,695,813, 4,703,293, and 4,499,442. Such prior art 
polarized relay comprises a coil block and an armature block 
which are fabricated as separate units and assembled 
together into a housinq provided with a set of contacts and 
contact terminals extending therefrom. The coil block 
includes a coil bobbin having an excitation coil wound 
therearound, a core inserted therethrough, and coil leads 
extending from the ends of the excitation coil. A permanent 
magnet is disposed between the opposed legs of the core 
projecting on the ends of the coil bobbin. The armature 
assembly includes an armature and a set of movable springs 
with movable contacts which are held together and movable 
with the armature. The armature is pivotally supported on 
the casing so as to movable between two contacting operating 
positions of closing and opening the movable contacts with 
respect to the corresponding contacts on the side of the 
casing. Since such prior polarized relay requires to  
 
assemble the separately fabricated coil block and the 
armature block into the casing, a special care should be 
taken in order to place the coil block and the permanent 
magnet into an exact position in relation to the armature 
block in order to assure a predetermined magnetic gap between 
the core of the coil block and the armature of the armature 
block. Also, another care should be taken to isolate the 
movable springs from the coil by a distance sufficiently for 
effective electrical insulation therebetween. The above 
problems will be more prominent when the relay is to be 
miniaturized. The document EP-A 0 481 371 discloses a polarized relay 
comprising a coil block having an elongated coil bobbin, a 
core inserted therein, and excitation coil means wound about 
said coil bobbin, said core having opposed pole ends 
projecting upwardly from longitudinal ends of said coil 
bobbin, said coil block including a permanent magnet 
interposed between said ends; and armature block having an 
elongated generally flat armature and a set of movable springs 
carrying movable contacts and held together with said armature 
by means of an electrically insulating harness molded on said 
armature, said armature
