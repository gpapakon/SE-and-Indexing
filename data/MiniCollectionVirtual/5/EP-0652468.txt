<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for changing a guide width is 
provided to automatically change a width of a width guide 

depending upon papers differing from each other in true 
width in spite of the same nominal size. The mechanism 

comprises a width guide, a pulse motor (16) for moving the 
width guide in a width direction of the paper, a detecting 

board (18) with detecting holes (20) attached to a guide member (13) of 
the width guide and a position sensor (19) detecting a standard 

position of the detecting holes, and is provided to move 
the guide member (13) only a distance of indicated pulses from 

the standard position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
automatically changing a guide width and a mechanism therefor
and, more particularly, to a method and a
mechanism for automatically changing the width of a guide so
that a photosensitive material can be guided properly
with respect to its width direction in a conveyance
course of photosensitive materials in a photo-processing
apparatus.The conventional width guide, as shown in Fig.
6 for example, comprises a pair of V-shaped members 51
guiding both side edges of a photosensitive material P and
screw shafts 52. The distance between the members 51 is
adjusted by turning the grew shafts 52 to move both or one
of the V-shaped members. A similar width guide is described in US-A-4,903,064 (cf: Fig. 3). It is also known to use a rack and
pinion (not illustrated) for moving the V-shaped members.The width of the width guide is fitted to the width of
a photosensitive material to be treated by turning the
screw shaft of the width guide or the pinion with a
operator's hand, or a motor and the like.In the concrete, the width of a width guide is
adjusted by inserting a photosensitive material to be
treated into a first width guide, looking at a clearance
between the width guide and an edge of the photosensitive
material and moving the width guide by a manual or
electromotive operation.DE 3 538 048 A1 describes a method for changing the width of a guide depending on the
true width of the photosensitive material to be processed in a photo-processing apparatus,
whereby the guide is adjusted manually or by sensoring the real width of the paper. The
guide has to be adjusted manually or automatically until it is set to the proper width. This
results in slow performance and it takes a long time until the guide is set up for
photographic papers of a different size.Another means for adjusting the width of a guide is disclosed in US-A-4,243,314, where
the width of a guide is adjusted manually or by a stepper motor. For changing the width
of the guide it is necessary to operate the stepper-motor by performing the corresponding
number of steps. This also results in slow performance.It takes, however, a long time and requires
complicated operations to adjust each width guide one by
one according to a photosensitive material every time the
photosensitive material is changed, since many width
guides are provided in a photo-processing apparatus along
a conveyance course of photosensitive material.Thus, there has been employed a
simple method wherein the width of a width guide for every
nom

Method of automatically changing the width of a guide
(13) for rolled photosensitive materials (p) in a photo-processing

apparatus (11, 12) suitable for processing
photosensitive materials of a plurality of nominal

widths, comprising the step of :

providing a guide comprising a pair of parallel
movable members (13),

characterized by the steps of:

memorising a plurality of standard guide member
widths one by one corresponding to each of a

plurality of nominal widths of photosensitive
materials (p) and a plurality of guide members

removal distances for each nominal width,
automatically driving the guide members to a standard
width corresponding to the nominal width of the

actual photosensitive material to be processed in the
apparatus,
automatically detecting the standard width of the
guide members corresponding to said nominal width,
automatically correcting the width of the guide
members by extending and/or reducing it by a guide

members removal distance relative to the detected
standard guide members width depending on the actual

width of said actual photosensitive material (p), so 
that a proper guide members width is reached for

guiding the actual photosensitive material in said
guide.
Mechanism for automatically changing the width of a guide
(13) for a rolled photosensitive material (p) to be used

in a photo-processing apparatus (1,2) depending on the
width of the photosensitive materials comprising:


a guide comprising a pair of parallel movable members
(13),

characterised by

memory means for storing a plurality of standard
guide member widths one by one corresponding to each

of a plurality of nominal widths of the photosensitive
materials to be processed in the apparatus and a

plurality of guide members removal distances for each
nominal width,

material (p) to be used in the apparatus,
a detecting means (17) for automatically detecting
standard widths of the width guide (13) members, and

an indication means (19) for automatically indicating
to the driving means (14) a standard width of the

guide members (13) to be reached, said width
corresponding to a nominal width of the actual

photosensitive material (p) to be used in the
apparatus and for further automatically indicating to

the driving means (14) the necessary guide members
removal distance from said standard width, depending

on the actual width of said actual photosensitive 
material, so that a proper guide members width is

reached for guiding the actual photosensitive
material in said guide.
