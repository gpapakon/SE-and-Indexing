<ABSTRACT>
A return pipe conveyer including an endless conveyer belt (1) 
supported between opposing rollers, support rollers (5) for 

supporting the belt and an object (8) to be conveyed during a 
conveying trip (1a) of the belt, shape supporting rollers (6) 

for rounding the belt (1) into a substantially pipe-shaped 
cross section during a return trip (19) of the belt (1) and 

pressing units (11) for pressing opposite lateral edges of 
the belt against the supporting rollers (5) to suppress 

warping of the belt caused by the shape supporting rollers 
(6) during the return trip (16), thereby ensuring smooth and

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a return pipe 
conveyer having an endless conveyer belt which is conveyed 
in a flat, guided manner for the conveying trip, and in a 
rounded, pipe-like shape for at least a middle part of the 
return trip. The conventional return pipe conveyers shown in Figs. 
5 and 6 have an endless conveyer belt 1 supported between 
a front roller 2 and a rear roller 3. The front roller 2 
or the rear roller 3 is rotated with a driving means (not 
shown), such as a motor, to circulate the conveyer belt 1 
around the rollers 2, 3. Multiple support frames 4 are 
appropriately spaced (e.g., equally spaced or staggered) in 
the direction of motion of the conveyer belt 1 between the 
rollers 2, 3, and above each support frame 4, there are 
multiple support rollers 5 which support the belt 1 during 
a conveying trip 1a of the belt 1 in a flat or slightly 
curved shape, while multiple shape supporting rollers 6 at 
the bottom part of the support frames 4 form the belt 1 
into a substantially rounded or pipe-like shape during the 
return trip 1b. The conveyed object 8 is placed on the conveyer belt 
1 from the supply hopper 7 during the conveying trip 1a,  
 
and then conveyed to the discharge hopper 9 where it is 
released. Multiple shape supporting rollers 6 are used for the 
return trip 1b of the conveyer belt 1 in order to wrap the 
conveying side of the belt 1 inwardly into a pipe-like 
shape so that portions of the conveyed object 8 which may 
be stuck on the surface of the conveying side of the belt 
1 do not fall out of the belt. A similar device is disclosed in Unexamined Japanese 
Patent Application No. (Kokai) 59-149211. In this conventional return pipe conveyer, the belt 1 
has a tendency to remain deformed in the round, pipe-like 
shape during the conveying trip, as shown by the dotted 
lines in Fig. 6, so that the sides of the belt on the 
conveying trip do not contact, and thus are not guided by, 
the supporting rollers 5. This is undesirable as it causes 
the belt to run unsteadily during the conveying trip. The object of the present invention is to supply a 
return pipe conveyer that eliminates the above-mentioned 
problems found in the conventional technology by 
suppressing the warping of the belt so as to supply smooth 
and stable action during the conveying trip. To achieve the above object, the present invention  
 
uses a return pipe conveyer having an endless conveyer belt 
supported in either a flat or curved shape by multiple 
support rollers each supported by a
