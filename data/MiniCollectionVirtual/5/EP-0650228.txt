<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement is proposed which is intended for closing an opening (18) which is used for the insertion of a plug into a casing (1) of an appliance. The opening (18), which is constructed on two mutually intersecting walls of the housing (1), is assigned a casing component (17) which is constructed as an angled piece. Folding connections are constructed in opposite senses on the walls of the casing (1) and on the casing component (17), in such a manner that the casing component (17) is installed such that it is flush with the wall and is self-securing.
