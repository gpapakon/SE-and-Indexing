<ABSTRACT>
A device for sawing slots in corrugated and composite pipes, which alternately have in each case annular prominences (36) and annular recesses (37), has a machine frame (1) with a pipe channel (32a) and a stroke slide (15) for pulling a pipe (33) through the pipe channel (32a). Two groups of holding and centring levers (39, 40) are provided which can be brought into engagement with a pipe (33) in order to axially and radially orientate and hold the pipe (33). Furthermore, saws (76) are provided which are arranged between two groups of holding and centring levers (39, 40) on the machine frame (1) and can be moved rectilinearly and radially towards or away from the axis (8) of the pipe channel (32a).

Apparatus for cutting slots in corrugated and twin-wall pipes having annular
elevations (36) alternating with annular impressions (37), comprising

the following features:

a machine frame (1) with a pipe duct (32a) for a pipe (33), the pipe duct
(32a) having a central longitudinal axis (8),
a lifting carriage (15) drivable by means of a lifting drive (22) in the direction
of the axis (8) for a pipe (33) to be moved through the pipe duct

(32a) in the direction of production (11),
two groups of holding and centering levers (39, 40) which are provided
with clamping segments (44), the groups - referred to the direction of

production (11) - being spaced from each other on the frame and
mounted to be pivotable from a position of engagement of the clamping

segments (44) with the annular impressions (37) to a position of release
of the pipe (33), and the holding and centering levers (39, 40) of each

group enclosing the pipe duct (32a) by more than 180°,
a group of conveying levers (41) which are provided with clamping
segments (44) and which are mounted on the lifting carriage (15) to be

pivotable from a position of engagement of the clamping segments (44)

with the annular impressions (37) to a position of release of the pipe
(33), these conveying levers (41) enclosing the pipe duct (32a) by more

than 180°,
pivoting drives (53, 54, 55) each provided for the driving of a group of
levers (39, 40, 41),
saws (76) disposed on the machine frame (1) between the two groups of
holding and centering levers (39, 40) and movable towards, and away

from, the pipe duct (32a).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the saws (76) are
disposed on carriages (70a) displaceable lineally towards, and away from,

the pipe duct (32a).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 2, 
characterized in that
 the
lifting carriage (15) is provided with at least one stop lever (42), which is

supported on the lifting carriage (15) to be pivotable from a position of
contact with the pipe (33) to a position of release from the pipe (33).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the
levers (39, 40, 41, 42) of each group are pivotably drivable by a common

pivoting drive (53 to 56).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the
levers (39, 40, 41, 42) of each group are connected with a pivoting drive

ring (46 to 49) which is pivotable about the central longitudinal axis (8)
and connected with a pivoting drive (53 to 56).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the
saws (76) each have at least one rotatably drivable circular saw blade (80,

80'), which is lineally displaceable radially to the axis (8).
Apparatus according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 at least one drive of
the pivoting drives (53 to 56) and the lifting drive (22) is a linear drive. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the at least one linear
drive (46 to 49 and 22) is adjustable by means of a spindle drive in the

direction of its linear direction of drive.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the
holding and centering levers (39) located upstream in the direction of production

(11) are provided with clamping elements (44a) to rest on a socket
(35) united with the pipe (33).
