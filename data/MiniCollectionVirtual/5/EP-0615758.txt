<ABSTRACT>
An immunogen suitable for use as an anti-tumor vaccine for 
inducing an anti-tumor immune response in cancer patients is derived from 

modified tumor cells and is capable of inducing an anti-tumor immune 
response. The immunogen is prepared by exposing tumor cells 

simultaneously to a crosslinking agent being a 2',3'-nucleoside or nucleotide 
dialdehyde at a concentration and for a time sufficient to cause crosslinking 

of proteins in the cell's plasma membrane and to hydrostatic pressure of 
about 1200-1400 atm a time sufficient to cause displacement of the proteins 

in the cell's plasma membranes. The exposure to said crosslinking agent and 
to hydrostatic pressure are preferably simultaneous.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally in the field of cancer therapy
and concerns novel immunogens,
a process for the preparation of said immunogens, an in vitro method of sensitizing
immune cells, a vaccine preparation capable of inducing an anti-tumor immune response
and the use of said vaccine preparation for the manufacture of a medicament.The immunogens of the present invention comprise
tumor cells which were treated to increase their specific immunogenicity and / or
plasma membranes of such cells.As is well known and documented, cancer cells generally
contain on their external surface specific neo-antigens which are foreign to
the host body. Nevertheless, for reasons which are not entirely clear, the 
immune system fails to develop an effective immune reaction against the
tumor cells. Attempts have been made to immunize cancer patients with
preparations that will stimulate their immune systems to develop a reaction
against the neo-antigens with the hope that such an immune reaction will
destroy the residing cancer.U.S. Patent No. 4,931,275 discloses anti-tumor vaccines which
contain as active ingredient tumor cells which have been treated to augment
their immunogenic properties, their plasma membranes or specific membrane
proteins obtained from these cells or membranes. The treatment which
augments their immunogenicity in accordance with this patent consists of
either exposure of the cells to cholesteryl hemisuccinate which rigidifies the
lipid layer of the plasma membrane, the application of hydrostatic pressure
up to about 1500 atm, or a combination of these two treatments.Ramakrishna & Shinitzky (Cancer Immunol. Immunother.,
1991, 33:1-8) showed that delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to
syngeneic tumors could be potentiated by cells treated with either hydrostatic
pressure up to 1200 atm, crosslinking with adenosine 2',3'-dialdehyde, or
with hydrostatic pressure followed by crosslinking.It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel
immunogen capable of inducing an anti-tumor immune response. More
specifically, it is an object of the present invention, to provide such an
immunogen which comprises modified tumor cells and/or plasma
membranes thereof.It is another object of the present invention to provide a
process for preparing said immunogen.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a
vaccine comprising said immunogen. In accordance with the present invention it was found, that an
immunogen having superior anti-tumor immunogenicity can be obtained
from
