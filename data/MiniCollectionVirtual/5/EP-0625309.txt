<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a method of sealing and/or 
shaping a food product and apparatus for use in 

performing the method. Food product is placed on a 
support surface (10), and a moulding surface - comprising 

a flexible diaphragm (25) is lowered over the food 
product. Air pressure acting on the diaphragm applies a 

force to the food product for the purpose of sealing 
and/or shaping the food product. The arrangement 

produces a more random appearance to the resulting food 
product. A plurality of food products are acted on by a 

respective moulding surface which are carried from a 
common framework. The support surface is preferably a 

conveyor belt and the framework is mounted for 
reciprocal movement so that moulding pressure can be 

applied to the food product during an indexing movement 
of the support surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and 
apparatus for sealing and/or shaping a food product. There is an increasing trend to give basic foods, 
be they meat, poultry or fish, added value by adding 
ingredients and/or presenting it in a certain shape or 
format. There is also an increasing trend to introduce 
automation into the production of such food products 
since it is perceived as reducing possible 
contamination by virtue of reducing the handling by 
humans. One area where automation has been introduced 
is in the sealing and shaping of food products in which 
a mould is employed usually comprising two halves in 
which the food product is introduced and pressed into 
shape conforming to the internal shape of the mould. 
However, this has the disadvantage that each product has 
substantially the same shape and this is perceived as a 
negative feature. Accordingly, it is an aim of the present 
invention to have an advantage of automation whilst 
avoiding the perceived disadvantages. Accordingly, a first aspect of the invention  
 
provides a method of sealing and/or shaping a food 
product comprising placing a food product to be further 
processed on a support surface, placing over the food 
product a sealing and/or shaping unit comprising a 
moulding surface by which pressure is applied to the 
food product to seal and/or shape same, and subsequent 
releasing the resulting product. Another aspect comprises apparatus sealing and/or 
shaping a food product comprising a support surface, a 
sealing and/or shaping unit comprising a moulding 
surface adapted to be moved towards and away from a food 
product placed on the support surface for the purposes 
of sealing and/or shaping same. Conveniently the positioning of the food product 
on the support surface is done manually and this can 
give rise to slight differences in the relative 
positioning between the food product and the processing 
station which, in turn, gives rise to a random shaping 
effect. It is preferred for the moulding surface to 
comprise a flexible diaphragm to which pressure is 
applied to urge it into contact with the food product. 
It is further preferred that the flexible diaphragm have 
a preformed starting shape. Pressure on the diaphragm 
will produce a largely uniform pressure on the food 
product and as a consequence the resulting shape will 
also be influenced by the original shape of the flexible  
 
diaphragm and by the composition of the food product, 
eg. relative density of the product, some parts of which 
may

A method of sealing and/or shaping a food product 
comprising placing a food product to be further 

processed on a support surface (10), placing over the 
food product a sealing and/or shaping unit comprising a 

moulding surface (25) by which pressure is applied to 
the food product to seal and/or shape same, and 

subsequently releasing the resulting product. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which 
positioning of the food product on the support surface 

is done manually. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in which the 

moulding surface comprises a flexible diaphragm (25) to 
which pressure is applied to urge it into contact with 

the food product. 
A method as claimed in claim 3 in which the 
flexible diaphragm has a preformed starting shape. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 
in which the moulding surface extends to a continuous 

periphery which is disposed beyond the extent of the 
food product and which is brought into sealing contact 

with the support surface. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 
comprising moving the support surface from a food 

product positioning station, lowering the sealing and/or 
 

shaping unit over the food product, moving the sealing 
and/or shaping unit and support surface in synchronism 

whilst applying pressure to the food product, raising 
the sealing and/or shaping unit and moving it upstream 

to its staring position and repeating the steps for 
subsequent food product. 
Apparatus for sealing and/or shaping a food 
product comprising a support surface (10), a sealing 

and/or shaping unit comprising a molding surface (25) 
adapted to be moved towards and away from a food product 

placed on the support surface for the purposes of 
sealing and/or shaping same. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7 in which the 
moulding surface comprises a flexible diaphragm. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8 in which the 
flexible diaphragm has a preformed starting shape. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 7, 8 or 
9 in which the moulding surface extends to a continuous 

periphery which is disposed beyond the extent of the 
food product.
