<ABSTRACT>
A process and apparatus (100) for delivering an involatile solid source reagent material having a vapor pressure of less than about 0.1 torr at 25  DEG C and 1 atmosphere conditions, and which is thermally unstable at its vaporization temperature, as a source reagent material vapor into a CVD reactor (12) comprising a vaporization zone (22) and a flash vaporization matrix structure (26) for flash vaporizing the involatile solid source reagent material. The invention is particularly useful for delivery of Group II reagents and compounds and complexes of early transition metals such as zirconium and hafnium, and may be usefully employed with Group II beta-diketonate source reagents to form high temperature superconductor material layers as well as for forming interlayers of Group II metal fluorides between superconductor or gallium arsenide overlayers, and for depositing thin films of photonic and ferroelectric materials, e.g., BaTiO3, BaxSr1-xNb2O6, and PbZr1-xTixO3.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for delivering reagents
in a form suitable for introduction into a deposition zone wherein films or layers
are formed on a substrate by decomposition of the reagent. More specifically,
the invention relates to apparatus and method for delivering involatile solid
source reagent materials having a vapor pressure less than about 13.3 Pa (0.1 torr) at
25°C and 101.3 kPa (1 atmosphere) conditions and which is thermally unstable at its
vaporization temperature, as a source reagent material vapor into a CVD reactor.
The invention has particular utility in film formation applications in which close
control of stoichiometry and uniform compositional control are primary
considerations.Recently many refractory materials have been identified as having unique
materials properties. The recently discovered high temperature superconducting
(HTSC) materials include YBa2Cu3Ox, wherein x is from about 6 to 7.3,
BiSrCaCuO, and TIBaCaCo. Barium titanate, BaTiO3, has been identified as a 
ferroelectric and photonic material with unique and potentially very useful
properties. BaxSr1-xNb2O6 is a photonic material whose index of refraction
changes as a function of electric field and also as a titanate, PbZr1-xTixO3, is
ferroelectric material whose properties are very interesting. The Group II metal
fluorides, BaF2, CaF2, and SrF2, are materials that are useful for scintillation
detecting and coating of optical fibers.Many of the potential applications of these materials require their use in thin
film, coating, or layer form. The films or layers may also be advantageously
epitaxially related to the substrate upon which they are formed. Applications in
which the refractory materials may need to be deposited in film or layer form include
integrated circuits, switches, radiation detectors, thin film capacitors, holographic
storage media, and various other microelectronic devices.Uses that are currently envisioned for the copper oxide superconductors
include high speed switches, bolometers, and high frequency communications
components such as mixers. These applications would desirably use the HTSC
material in the form of thin films in devices that can be made using well-known
microelectronic fabrication technology.Thin films comprising the Group II metal fluorides, BaF2, CaF2, and SrF2,
are potentially vary useful as buffer layers for interfacing between silicon
substrates and HTSC or GaAs overlayers or between GaAs substrates and
HTSC or silicon overlayers, and combinations, of two
