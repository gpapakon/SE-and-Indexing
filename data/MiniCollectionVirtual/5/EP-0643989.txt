<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for mixing a liquid with another liquid or a solid by blowing a gas onto the liquid surface, and a system for carrying out the process. The gas is blown onto the liquid surface from a distance which can be set on the basis of a determination of the liquid surface. A system according to the invention therefore contains both a device for blowing a gas onto a liquid surface and a device for detecting a liquid surface.

<CLAIMS>
Method for mixing a liquid with at least one other
liquid or with at least one solid in a vessel made

of an optically transparent material that can be
accessed through an opening, using at least one jet

of gas emerging from a mixing element which
comprises the steps


a) moving the mixing element towards the liquid
surface,
b) measuring the distance between the mixing
element and liquid surface,
c) ending the movement of the mixing element when a
predetermined distance between the mixing

element and liquid surface is reached,
d) blowing a gas from the mixing element onto the
liquid surface so that the liquid is set in

motion,

wherein the distance measurement is carried out
optically by means of a device outside the vessel.
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the mixing
element contains devices which serve to deliver

liquids into the vessel.
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the predetermined
distance between the mixing element and

liquid surface is 3 to 6.5 mm. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a gas is
blown from the mixing element towards the liquid

surface in order to displace foam or substances
that are on the liquid.
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the blowing
of the gas is not interrupted in the meantime.
Method as claimed in claim 1 including a step which
comprises detection of mixing.
Apparatus for mixing a liquid with at least one
other liquid or with at least one solid which

comprises the following elements:

a) a vessel made of an optically transparent
material which contains the substances to be

mixed and at least one opening,
b) a mixing element which has at least one nozzle
through which a jet of gas can emerge,
c) a device for measuring the distance between the
liquid surface and mixing element,
d) a device for moving the mixing element towards
and away from the phase boundary,
e) an evaluation and control device with which the
positioning of the mixing element and discharge

of gas from the mixing element can be controlled
based on signals from the detection device

taking into account an operating cycle programme

wherein a device for the optical measurement of the
distance is located outside the vessel. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7, wherein the mixing
element has a nozzle with an opening perpendicular

to the longitudinal axis of the mixing element and
at least one additional nozzle whose opening is

tilted with respect to the longitudinal axis of the
mixing element.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7, wherein the mixing
element has a set of nozzles whose openings are

essentially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis
of the mixing element and which are further away

from the tip of the mixing element than the
aforementioned nozzles.
