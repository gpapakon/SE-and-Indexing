<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 3-halo-5-halomethyl-2-oxazolidinones
and to the method of their
preparation. This invention also relates to methods of use
of these compounds as microbicides.A large number of commercial, industrial, agricultural,
and wood products are subject to microbiological attack which
reduces or destroys their economic value. Examples of
materials that may be subject to microbiological degradation
are surface coatings, wood, agricultural seed, leather and
plastics, including flexible plastics.The temperature at which these products are stored and
their intrinsic characteristics make these products
susceptible to the growth of microorganisms. These
microorganisms can be introduced during the manufacturing of
these products by exposure to air, tanks, pipes, equipment,
and humans and/or during their use from multiple openings and
reclosures of packaged products and by the introduction of
contaminated objects to stir or remove material.Aqueous systems containing organic materials are also
highly subject to microbiological attack. Such aqueous
systems include latexes, surfactants, dispersants,
stabilizers, thickeners, adhesives, starches, waxes,
proteins, emulsifying agents, detergents, cellulose products,
agricultural irrigation fluids,and resins formulated in
aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions.These systems frequently contain relatively large
amounts of water causing them to be well-suited environments
for microbiological growth and, thus, attack and degradation.
Microbiological degradation of aqueous systems containing
organic materials may manifest itself as a variety of 
problems, such as loss of viscosity, gas formation,
objectionable odors, decreased pH, emulsion breaking, color
change, and gelling.Another objectionable phenomenon occurring in industrial
process systems involving water is slime formation. Slime
consists of matted deposits of microorganisms, fibers and
debris. It may be stringy, pasty, rubbery, tapioca-like, or
hard, and may have a characteristic undesirable odor that is
different from that of the liquid suspensions in which it is
formed.The microorganisms primarily involved in slime formation
are different species of spore-forming and nonspore-forming
bacteria, in particular capsulated forms of bacteria which
secrete gelatinous substances that envelop or encase the
cells. Slime microorganisms also include filamentous
bacteria, filamentous fungi of the mold type, yeasts, and
yeast-like organisms. Slime reduces yields in paper
production and causes
