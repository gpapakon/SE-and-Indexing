<ABSTRACT>
A grip for stick has a moulded body (20) made of a dimensionally stable material mountable on an end of the stick and a grip casing (22) made of a grasp-friendly material which encloses the shaped body (20). In order to obtain a light grip with a comfortable gripping surface suitable for mass production, the grasp-friendly material is a mixture of an elastomer and of a cork material applied on the inner shaped body (20), in particular by an injection moulding process, in order to form the grip casing (22).

Grip for stick having an inner moulded body (20) consisting of a 
dimensionally stable material and adapted for being attached to 

one end of the stick, and a grip jacket (22) made from a material 
that grips well,
characterised in that
 
the well-gripping material is a mixture of an elastomer and a cork 

material which is injection-moulded onto the inner moulded body 
(20) for forming the grip jacket (22). 
Grip for stick according to claim 1, characterised in that the cork 
content in the well-gripping material is between 30 % and 98 %, 

preferably between 65 % and 90 %, especially 80 %. 
Grip for stick according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
cork material consists of cork granules or cork pow
der, the grain 
size of the granules or powder being between 0.3 and 3 mm, 

preferably between 0.5 and 2 mm, and especially approximately 1 
mm. 
Grip for stick according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that 
the well-gripping material contains thermoplastic elastomers, 

especially ethyl propylene mixed polymers (EPM) or ethyl vinyl 
acetate (EVA) copolymers or mixtures of EPM/EVA copolymers.  

 
Grip for stick according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that pigments and/or lightguard waxes are 

admixed to the well-gripping material. 
Grip for stick according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the inner moulded body has a profiled, 

especially an undulated surface.
