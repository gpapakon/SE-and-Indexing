<ABSTRACT>
The dashboard (1) of a motor vehicle has an interior rigid strengthening board (10), a plastic foam layer (8) above the latter and an outer skin (7) which covers the latter, a lid (6) of the same structure being integrated via an airbag unit (2) in the dashboard, being capable of being moved away in the event of a collision so as to release an aperture via which an airbag (3) is able to unfold from the storage space behind the dashboard. According to the invention, the strengthening section (11) of the lid (6) is a separate part of the adjoining strengthening board surface. To produce a dashboard of this type, action is taken to ensure that the aperture lid (6) is separated from the strengthening board before or after the entire strengthening board is covered with foam.

<CLAIMS>
Instrument panel in a motor vehicle, having an
interior, rigid reinforcement panel (10), a foamed-plastic

layer (8) located thereabove and an outer skin
(7) which covers said layer, a cover (6) which likewise

exhibits this construction and lies above an airbag unit
being integrated into the 
instrument panel, which cover,
in the event of a crash, can move away and releases an

opening through which an airbag (3) can unfold out of the
receiving means (22) behind the instrument panel, a

reinforcement portion (11) of the cover (6) comprising a
part which is separated off from the reinforcement panel

along the contour of the cover, characterized in that, in
cross-section, the parting joint of the reinforcement

portion (11) of the cover (6) runs at an angle other than
90Â° with respect to the extent of the cover and, as a

result, the reinforcement portion can be subjected to
loading from the outside.
Process for producing an instrument panel according
to Claim 1, characterized in that the reinforcement

portion (11) of the cover (6) is separated off after
foaming of the reinforcement panel (10).
Process for producing an instrument panel according
to Claim 1, characterized in that the reinforcement

portion (11) of the cover (6) is separated off before
foaming of the reinforcement panel (10) and, for the

purpose of foaming, is connected to said panel by
releasable connecting elements.
