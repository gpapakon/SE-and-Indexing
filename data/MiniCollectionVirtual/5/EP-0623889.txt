<ABSTRACT>
An optical bar code scanner has a laser for generating a 
coherent light beam, and a multifaceted rotatable mirror for 

scanning the beam. The scanned beam is reflected from at 
least three fixed mirrors. Two of these mirrors reflect the 

beam horizontally through a window (12) in the scanner housing. 
Another mirror reflects the beam upwards, through a hologram, 

within the housing. The hologram converts the horizontal 
scanning pattern of this upwardly-reflected beam into a 

vertical scan pattern, directed horizontally through the 
window.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical bar code scanners for
scanning bar code labels. Such scanners are typically used,
for example, in retail check-out stations to read bar code
labels on packages.The invention is particularly concerned with optical bar code
scanners of the type in which the scanning optics are
positioned to the side of the scanning area, rather than
being positioned below the scanning area. One such side
scanner is described, for example, in US Patent No 4652732.The side scanner described in the above-mentioned patent
produces three scanning light beams directed into the
scanning area. Two of these beams are scanned in a generally
horizontal direction and the other beam is scanned in a
generally vertical direction. The vertical scan lies between
the two horizontal scans.The object of the present invention is to provide an improved
optical scanner, compared with the above-mentioned patent. According to the invention bar code scanning apparatus
comprises:
(a) a housing having an optically transmissive window in a
side wall of the housing, said window defining a
scanning region horizontally adjacent to said window;(b) a light source within said housing, for generating a
coherent beam of light;(c) scanning means mounted within said housing for
deflecting said beam of light to produce a scanning beam
of light which traces a scan pattern comprising a
plurality of substantially parallel spaced apart scan
lines;(d) first, second and third redirection means mounted within
said housing, for redirecting said scanning beam of
light to produce first, second and third output beams of
light which respectively trace first, second and third
scan patterns each comprising a plurality of
substantially parallel spaced apart scan lines, the scan
lines of said first and second scan patterns being
oriented substantially horizontally and the scan lines
of said third scan pattern being oriented substantially
vertically; and(e) means for detecting light reflected back through said
window from a bar code being scanned within said
scanning region; 
characterised in that
(f) the scan lines of said third scan pattern enter said
scanning region through said window to one side of and
not between the scan lines of said first and second scan
patterns;(g) each of said first and second redirection means
comprises only a single mirror; and(h) said third redirection means comprises only a single
mirror and a single holographic element.Figure 1 is a sectional side view of an optical scanner in
accordance with the invention.
