 NON-PLANAR FLEXIBLE GRAPHITE SEALING RINGSBackgroundThis invention relates to a non-planar flexible graphite sealing ring used to minimize fluid leakage in a valve stuffing box that occurs between the valve stem and the stuffing box housing.In a fluid handling device, such as a pump or a valve, where a moving stem or shaft extends through a wall of the device, a seal is required at that point to prevent the fluid from leaking from the device. Leakage from such fluid handling devices is undesirable for obvious health, air quality, and safety reasons. For example, a leak of a toxic or flammable fluid could pose a direct threat to human life. Today's heightened environmental consciousness is another influential driving force behind minimizing leaks of toxic or other potentially harmful liquids or gasses onto the ground or into the atmosphere.Accordingly, such fluid handling devices are often sealed by placing a formed packing material around the shaft, and containing the packing material in the compressed state in a stuffing box. Ideally, the packing material selected should be resilient such that it deforms under compression to conform to the interior of the stuffing box and forms a tight interference seal against the shaft. The packing material should also present a low friction surface to the moving shaft and 

 be stable under the environmental conditions to which it may be exposed. It is also desirable that the packing material act to keep the shaft clean and clear of debris by wiping the surfaces of the shaft as the shaft is passed through the stuffing box. Preferably,_ the packing is a self energized seal, i.e., that it o seals by application of pressure on the seal. It is also desirable that the packing material itself be resistant to fire since many applications are for petrochemical service where fire may be a concern.Flexible graphite is known in the art and has long 0 been employed as a packing material to form seals for the stuffing box assembly of pumps, valves and like fluid handling devices. Flexible graphite refers to graphite which has been exfoliated and recompressed to a coherent body. The advantage of using graphite as a 5 packing material lies in its excellent thermal stability and chemical resistance. Graphite is also 'a low friction composition that has commonly been used as a lubricant in certain applications. However, as practiced in the art, flexible graphite has not always 0 proven to be an adequate sealing material due to the lack of resiliency inherent in the particular form

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A shaft seal comprising: a shaft; a stuffing box around the shaft; a packing between the shaft and stuffing box comprising a sealing ring having at least one non-planar end face; and means engaging each face of the ring for biasing at least one edge of the non-planar face of the ring toward the shaft or stuffing box for sealing against the shaft or stuffing box respectively; and wherein the ring is formed substantially entirely of axially compressed exfoliated graphite having bonded faces transverse to the axis of the shaft.
2. A shaft seal as recited in claim 1 wherein the sealing ring comprises a chevron shaped cross section having approximately complementary inner and outer end faces.
3. A shaft seal as recited in claim 1 wherein the end faces of the sealing ring comprise a chevron in transverse cross section, one end face of the chevron being convex and the other end face being concave, the included angle of the convex chevron being greater than the included angle of the concave chevron.
4. A shaft seal as recited in either of claims 2 or 3 wherein the chevron comprises a convex face has a relatively larger included angle nearer the center of the chevron and a relatively smaller included angle nearer each edge of the chevron.
5. A shaft seal as recited in claim 4 wherein the convex face has an included angle adjacent to the apex which is relatively larger than the included angle of 


 the concave face, and the included angle of the convex face nearer the inner and outer diameters of the ring is relatively smaller than the included angle of the concave face of the chevron.
6. A shaft seal as recited in either of claims 2 or 3 wherein the chevron is asymmetrical, being relatively narrower near the shaft and relatively wider further from the shaft.
7. A shaft seal as recited in claim 1 wherein the non-planar sealing ring comprises a cross section having approximately complementary curved or toroidal shaped inner and outer end faces.
8. A shaft seal as recited in any of the preceding claims wherein the graphite ring has a density in the range of from 1.2 gm/cm
3
 to 2.3 gm/cm
3
.
9. A shaft seal as recited in any of the preceding.claims wherein each ring has a layer between a bonded face and the end of the ring which is thinner than a layer between adjacent bonded faces.
10. A shaft seal as recited in any of the preceding claims wherein the means for engaging the ends of the sealing ring comprises: a first end ring for one end of a stack of sealing rings, the first end ring having a convex face similar to a convex face on a sealing ring, and an opposite end face with a flat bearing surface and a concave circumÂ¬ ferential groove in the flat surface; and a second end ring for the other end of a stack of sealing rings, the second end ring having a concave face similar to a concave face on a sealing ring, and an opposite end face with a flat bearing surface and 


two concave circumferential grooves in the flat surface.
11. A valve comprising: a valve body including a fluid flow passage through the valve; means for closing the fluid flow passage; a shaft for actuating the means for closing the fluid flow passage; and a shaft seal between the shaft and valve body, the seal comprising: an annular cavity surrounding the shaft; and a plurality of packing rings in the cavity as recited in any of the preceding claims.
12. A method for forming a flexible graphite sealing ring comprising the steps of: compressing exfoliated graphite into sheets; stacking a plurality of sheets of compressed exfoliated graphite; cutting a ring from the stacked sheets with the circumferential edges of the ring being transverse to the faces of the sheets; and axially compressing the ring for further compressing the exfoliated graphite, bonding the faces of the sheets together, and forming non-planar end faces on the ring.
