<ABSTRACT>
11 beta -substituted 14,17-ethanoestratrienes have general formula (I), in which R
<
1
>
 stands for a hydrogen atom, a C1-C12-alkanoyl group, a straight- or branched-chain C1-C12-alkyle, a C3-C7-cycloalkyle or a C4-C8-alkylcycloalkyle group; R
<
2
>
 stands for a hydrogen atom or a C1-C12-alkanoyl group and R
<
3
>
 for a grouping (A) or (B) or R
<
4
>
 -SO-; n equals 0, 1 or 2; and R
<
4
>
 and R
<
5
>
 represent independently from each other a hydrogen atom or a straight- or branched-chain C1-C8-alkyle group that may also be partially fluorinated. Also disclosed are a process for producing these compounds, pharmaceutical preparations containing these compounds and their use for producing medicaments.
