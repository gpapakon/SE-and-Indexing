<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for introducing sealing material into at least one tubular injection element (12, 13), such as a hose and/or channel, in a concrete joint-sealing system, the injection element joining forming a sealant-injection path in the interior of the concrete and being laid between a primary and a secondary concrete slab on the surface of the primary slab and surrounded by the secondary slab. On injection, sealent flows out of the injection element into the joints between the concrete slabs. The device consists of a target element (1) which is connected for sealant transfer with the injection element and forms a cavity in the secondary concrete slab. In comparison with the injection element, the cross-sectional dimensions of the target element (1) are considerably larger, the target element (1) acting as a target for a bore made from outside, after producing the secondary concrete slab, through the secondary slab into the target element (1), the sealant being introduced through the bore into the target element (1) and, from there, into this injection element (12, 13).

concrete slab, with 


a) at least one injection hose (14) or injection channel (12, 13) or 
the like which can be laid on the surface of the primary concrete slab

dimensions of the injection hose (14) or injection channel (12 or 13) or 
the like element, and which serves as a target for a bore made from 

outside through the secondary slab into the target element (1) after the 
secondary concrete slab has been cast, through which the sealing
