<ABSTRACT>
A process for significantly improving the 
adhesion of a refractory metal deposited on diamond is 

disclosed. The process involves depositing an initial 
thin metal coating by low pressure chemical vapor 

deposition on diamond, heat treating in a non-oxidizing 
environment, and continuing the deposition 

of the initial metal coating until a desired thickness 
is achieved. Diamond sheets that have undergone the 

inventive process where 15 micrometers of tungsten are 
deposited, exhibit tungsten adhesive values in excess 

of 10,000 pounds per square inch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to significant
improvements in adhesion of metal coatings on diamond
and more particularly concerns a method of producing
improved adhesion of tungsten on diamond.Reference is made to a commonly assigned,
copending application, EP-A-0611091 (US Serial No. 08/016,367,
filed in USA February 11, 1993) for A Process for Making
Metallized Vias in Diamond Substrates.Diamond has been widely used as
superabrasive grit in sawing, drilling, dressing, and
grinding applications because of its hardness.
Diamond is also an attractive choice for use in high
frequency, high-power, high temperature,or high
radiation field applications. This is due to its wide
band gap (5.5 eV), unequaled thermal conductivity (20
W/cm2-K), high electric field breakdown voltage, high
electron saturation velocity, and high electron and
hole mobilities.Further, since synthetic diamond is a
lightweight insulator with a thermal conductivity four 
times that of copper, it represents an ideal high
performance multi-chip module substrate. Such use of
diamond would not only reduce chip temperatures in
conventional 2-D multi-chip modules, but also make it
practical to implement ultra high performance, 3-dimensionally
interconnected multi-chip modules (see
EP-A-0 611091). Thus, there exist many present
and potential applications for non-gem and synthetic
diamond in the marketplace.However, in order to use non-gem and
synthetic diamonds in industrial applications, a metal
coating on the diamond is often required. Depending
on the application, the metal coating may need to be
several microns thick. This requirement has often
been a limitation because of poor adhesion of the
metal coating on diamond.For instance, when diamond is used as
superabrasive grit in sawing applications, the grit is
typically held in a matrix of nickel, copper, iron,
cobalt, or tin, or alloys thereof, by mechanical bonds
and the matrix is connected to a tool body. In an
attempt to improve grit retention, diamond particles
have been coated with carbide forming transition
metals, such as titanium or zirconium, by metal vapor
deposition. The coating's inner surface forms a
carbide with the diamond. A second layer of a less
oxidizable metal, such as nickel or copper, can then
be applied to protect the inner layer from oxidation.Tensile testing of double layer coated
diamond having an inner layer, such as titanium, and
an outer layer, such as nickel, shows that fracturing
occurs at the interface between the inner and outer 
layers. This suggests that the
