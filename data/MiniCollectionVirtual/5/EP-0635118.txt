<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of meters and
particularly to meters for continuously measuring the
composition and mass flow rate of mixtures containing
hydrocarbons. Many types of measurement apparatus have been
proposed and are being used for continuously measuring water
content, density, or composition of hydrocarbon or
hydrocarbon and water mixtures. But most suffer from a
number of limitations caused by difficulties with measuring
mixtures containing liquid and gas or difficulties
associated with variations in the specific gravity of the
hydrocarbon being measured. Measuring the composition of
oil, water, and gas mixtures is one example. Meters for
this purpose are typically referred to as multiphase
composition meters. See U.S. Patents 4,458,524 and
4,760,742 and U.K. Patent 2,210,461.The current practice in the oil industry for measuring the
quantities of oil, water, and gas being produced by a given
well or group of wells is to separate the components in a
separator and measure the components individually. The
separators are large, expensive, maintenance intensive, and
typically provide production information only at long
intervals. With continuous multiphase meters to replace the
separators, oil producers can dramatically improve the crude
oil and natural gas production process, particularly
offshore production. Most proposed multiphase composition meters are designed to
continuously measure the volume fractions of oil, water, and gas
being produced. The composition meter can be combined with a
flowmeter such that production rates for the three components can be
calculated. One variety of proposed multiphase composition meter
combines a dielectric constant measurement means with a density
measurement means. See, for example, U.S patent 4,458,524. These
devices take advantage of the different dielectric constant and
densities of oil, water, and gas, respectively, to determine their
volume fractions. Temperature and pressure sensors are included in
the metering package to facilitate these calculations.In order for them to function properly, they must be able to
calculate the dielectric constants and/or densities of the three
individual components at the measurement conditions. This is
impossible. Several of the lower-density hydrocarbon components
(ethane, propane, butane, and pentane among them) can exist in
either a liquid or a gaseous state at pressures between 20 and 250
atm. Therefore, the fundamental methods and equations used by these
meters to determine the composition of the
