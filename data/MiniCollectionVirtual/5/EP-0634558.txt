<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a panel for a roller shutter with plastic slats fitted by interaction of a hooked border (4) of a slat retained by a lip (6) of a female border of the following slat, characterised in that the lateral locking of the slats is achieved by interaction of a notch (14) of a slat and of a portion of wire (3) pushed into the other slat, notch and portion of wire being parallel to an edge of the panel and at a predetermined distance (x) from the latter. The invention also relates to a method and a machine for implementing it. The invention is of interest to manufacturers of roller shutters or slatted curtains.

Method of assembling slats of a roller shutter apron, each slat 
comprising an internal face (7) and an external face (8) which are 

separated by ribs (9, 10, 11, 12, 13), said method being of the type 
comprising a step of positioning a slat (2) by sliding its hook-shaped 

edging (4) into the female edging (6) of the preceding slat (1), comprising 
at least the steps of: 


forming a slot (14) in one edging of a slat parallel to, and at a 
distance (x) from, the edge of the slat, and 
positioning a piece of wire (3) parallel to the edge of the apron and 
at the distance (x) therefrom, 
 
characterised in that the positioning of the piece of wire (3) consists of 

mserting a portion of said piece of wire into one of the edgings of one of 
the slats until it abuts against one of the internal ribs (11) of said slat, and 

accommodating the other portion of said piece of wire (3) in the slot (14) 

of the other slat. 
Method according to the preceding claim, characterised in that the 
slot (14) is formed in the female edging (6) of the slat (2), and in that the 

piece of wire is inserted into the opposite rib (13) just above the hook-shaped 
edging (4) of the preceding slat (1). 
Method of assembly according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that it further comprises the steps of: 


presenting the slat with the hook portion turned towards the 
preceding slat;  

 
introducing the slat (1) and putting it in the cutting position at a 
predetermined distance (D) from the edge of the apron; 
cutting the slat; 
then, after the slot has been formed and the piece of wire has been 
positioned, removing the slat (2) from the apron; and 
completing the assembly by transferring the slat (1) into the 
definitive position and rolling-up the apron. 
Apron for a roller shutter with plastic slats interlocked by the co-operation 
of a hook-shaped edging (4) of a slat (2) retained by a lip (6) of 

a female edging of the following slat, each slat comprising an internal face 
(7) and an external face (8) which are separated by ribs (9, 10, 11, 12, 13), 

the lateral locking of the slats being achieved by the co-operation between 
a slot (14) of a slat and a piece of wire (3) inserted into the other slat, the 

slot and the piece of wire being parallel to an edge of the apron at a 
predetermined distance (x) therefrom, characterised in that the piece of 

wire (3) comprises a portion inserted perpendicularly into an edging of a 
slat and abutting against an internal rib (11) of said slat, the other portion 

of the piece of wire (3) being accommodated in the slot of the other slat. 
Apron for a shutter according to the preceding claim, characterised 
in that the slot (14) is provided in the female edging (6) and the piece of 

wire inserted into the rib (13) opposite and just above the hook-shaped 
rib (4).  

 
Apron for a shutter according to one of claims 4 and 5, 
characterised in that the wire is chamfered. 
Machine for accomplishing the method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that it comprises: 


a grinding wheel movable in a vertical plane in order to form a slot 
(14) at a distance (x) from the edge; and 
an assembly of a wire straightener (25), cutting tool (27) and jack 
(43) for sending a wire (23) coming from a reel (24) into the slat. 
Machine according to the preceding claim, characterised in that it 
further comprises: 


a guide bar placed on a feed table; 
a drive wheel (20) and a retractable stop member for putting the 
slat in the cutting position; 
a gripping means (31) retaining the slat between its pressing 
finger (32) and a compensating block (33); 
a spacer member (28) opening the edging of the apron; and 
a sensor (29) for instructing two jacks (41, 42) to push the apron 
by the width of a slat. 
Machine according to one of claims 6 and 7, characterised in that it 
comprises a drive motor and an axle for rolling-up the apron as it is being 

formed. 
Machine according to one of claims 6 to 9, characterised in that it 
comprises a rear station (40) comprising sensors and limit means and  

 
carrying the stop member (21) at a fixed distance (D), the whole assembly 

being displaceable.
