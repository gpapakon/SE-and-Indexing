<ABSTRACT>
Process for the recovery of fluorinated sulphonic 
acid catalyst from tar being formed during alkylation of 

hydrocarbons in the presence of the fluorinated sulphonic 
acid catalyst and containing spent fluorinated sulphonic 

acid catalyst in form of salts with basic components in the 
tar, which process comprises,

 
   treating the tar with a proton donating acid by 

mixing of the acid and the tar, thereby, converting the 
spent catalyst to the fluorinated sulphonic acid;

 
   separating the obtained fluorinated sulphonic acid 

from the tar-acid mixture by stripping off the acid from 
the mixture with an inert stripping agent at a temperature 

of 0-200
o
C and pressure of 0.001-1 atm; and finally
 

   recovering the separated fluorinated sulphonic acid 
from the stripping agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to improvements 
in catalyzed alkylation of aliphatic hydrocarbons. More particulary, the invention is related to the 
recovery of a fluorinated sulphonic acid catalyst from acid 
tar being formed as by-product during alkylation of hydrocarbons. In US Patent No. 4,096,199 a method for 
the recovery of fluorosulphuric acid catalyst is 
suggested by which the acid is regenerated from an acid-water 
mixture by addition of sulphur trioxide to a gase phase 
resulting from the acid-water mixture and containing hydrogen 
fluoride. By reaction of sulphur trioxide the fluorosulphuric 
acid catalyst is regenerated from hydrogen fluoride. Use of proton donating acid for recovering acetic acid is 
disclosed in GB Patent Application No. 2,139,624.  
 Acid catalyzed alkylation of aliphatic hydrocarbons 
with olefinic hydrocarbons is a well known process for the 
preparation of high octane gasoline products. Alkylation of 
aliphatic hydrocarbons is generally accomplished in the 
liquid phase by reacting paraffins and olefins in the presence 
of a strong acid catalyst. Utilization of fluorinated sulphonic acids as efficient 
alkylation catalysts in the alkylation of aliphatic 
hydrocarbons with olefins is disclosed in European Patent 
Application No. 433,954. 
By the disclosed process, a process stream including 
a hydrocarbon substrate and an olefinic alkylating 
agent is reacted in contact with a fluorinated sulphonic 
acid catalyst in a fixed bed alkylation reactor containing 
polar contact material. On the contact material is established 
a reaction zone with the fluorinated sulphonic acid 
catalyst adsorbed within a confined area of the contact 
material. In the reaction zone, the process stream is 
converted at alkylating conditions to a product stream of 
alkylated hydrocarbons by catalysis of the fluorinated 
sulphonic acid adsorbed on the contact material. During the alkylation reaction, the acid catalyst 
and, consequently, the reaction zone, moves as a well-defined 
band between the ends of the reactor due to interaction 
with the process stream flowing through and reacting 
in the zone.  
 Although it is possible to reuse the acid catalyst 
as it reaches the outlet end of the alkylation reactor by 
reversing the flow direction of the process stream introduced 
into the alkylation reactor, small amounts of the 
acid catalyst will continuously be trapped in tar by-product 
being formed by side reactions during the process. The tar 
adsorbs like the acid catalyst as a movable
