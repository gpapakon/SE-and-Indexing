<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multiple-column press or similar press installation for forming sheet metal parts, having a bed plate (7) or bed plates, pressing columns (1, 2) and a plurality of pressing rams (8, 9), which are driven by the press drive (12), for workpiece upper parts (10) which interact with workpiece lower parts (11), the gear for converting the rotary movement of the motor drive (13) into the reciprocating movement of the pressing rams (8, 9) being each situated between pressing columns (2) which are situated opposite one another and form a pair of columns in each case and above the point at which force is imparted to the pressing rams (8, 9), two gears being incorporated in each pair of columns of the two pressing rams (8, 9). This design makes it possible to drive the pressing rams (8, 9) which are assigned to a pair of pressing columns from one pressing column region.

<CLAIMS>
Multi-column press or similar press installation
for forming sheet-metal parts, having a press table or

press tables (7), press columns (1,2) and a plurality of
press rams (8,9) which are driven by the press drive (12)

and are intended for top die parts (10) which interact
with bottom die parts (11), the gear mechanisms (14,15)

for turning the rotary movement of the motor drive (13)
into the up and down movement of the press rams (8,9)

being arranged between mutually opposite press columns
(1,2), each forming a column pair (1,1 or 2,2), and above

the point at which force is initiated (16) into the press
rams (8,9), and two gear mechanisms (14,15) being introduced

in the respective column pair (1,1 or 2,2) of two
press rams (8,9), and force initiation (16) into the two

press rams (8,9) assigned to one column pair (2,2) taking
place symmetrically with respect to the tie rods (3) of

said column pair (1,1 or 2,2), characterized in that in
each case two tie rods (3) form a press column (2) of the

column pair assigned to two press rams (8,9), the centres
of said tie rods being arranged on a common line (17).
