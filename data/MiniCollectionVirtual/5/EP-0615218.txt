<ABSTRACT>
The compensating method involves using a second light transmitter(LS2) is provided, which with the existing light receiver(LE) detects a moisture coating on the receiver optic(EL). Whilst periodically the smoke density(MWR) is measured with t he first light transmitter(LS1), and at times alternates with the humidity(MWF) measured with the first light transmitter(LS2). The two measurement values are processed. The second light transmitter is arranged in the direct vicinity of the light receiver(LE) or its receiver optic(EL), such that the transmitted light brushes the receiver optic(EL) approximately tangentially, and the moisture coating(WT) reflects the light of the second light transmitter. So that the receiver output signal weakens, depending on the thickness of the moisture coating.

Method for compensating the atmospheric humidity 
in a scattered-light detector (SM), having a measuring 

chamber (MK), an opto-transmitter (LS1) with associated 
optical system (SL), and an opto-receiver (LE) with 

associated optical system (EL), the output signal of 
which opto-receiver represents a measured value for the 

smoke density and serves to raise the alarm in a fire 
alarm system having a control centre (Z) and primary 

alarm lines (ML) to which the scattered-light detectors 
(SM) are connected, it being the case that the atmospheric 

humidity in the measuring chamber (MK) is measured 
and a measured humidity value (MWF) is determined by 

means of a device for linearizing measured values and is 
compensated by means of the measured humidity value (MWF) 

above a specific limiting value of the measured smoke 
density value (MWR), and the compensated measured smoke 

density value (KMWR) is further processed in order to 
form alarm criteria, characterized in that a further 

opto-transmitter (LS2) and the already present opto-receiver 
(LE) are used to detect a film (WT) of moisture 

on the receiving optical system (EL) by periodically 
measuring the smoke density (MWR) by means of the first 

opto-transmitter (LS1) and, temporally offset therefrom, 
measuring the humidity (MWF) by means of the second opto-transmitter 

(LS2) and processing the two measured values, 
the second opto-transmitter (LS2) being arranged in the 

direct vicinity of the opto-receiver (LE) or its receiving 
optical system (EL) in such a way that the 

emitted light grazes the receiving optical system (receiving 
lens surface EL) approximately tangentially, and the  

 
film (WT) of moisture reflects the light of the second 

opto-transmitter (LS2) and thus attenuates the receiver 
output signal as a function of the thickness of the film 

of moisture. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that in the absence of a film of moisture the receiver 

output signal is given a basic setting via the driving 
output of the second opto-transmitter (LS2). 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the basic setting is selected such that an amplifier 

(E-Sch) connected downstream of the opto-receiver (LE) is 
operated in the upper drive range. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized either in that the compensation is performed 

in the scattered-light detector (SM; µR) and the 
compensated measured smoke density value (KMWR) is 

transmitted to the control centre (Z), or the measured 
smoke density value (MWR) and the measured atmospheric 

humidity value (MWF) are transmitted alternately to the 
control centre (Z). 
Device for carrying out the method according to 
one of Claims 1 to 4, the scattered-light detector (SM) 

having the following features: 

a first transmitter circuit (S-Schl), which drives the 
first opto-transmitter (LS1), 
a second transmitter circuit (S-Sch2), which drives the 
second opto-transmitter (LS2), which latter is arranged 

in the immediate vicinity of the opto-receiver (LE) or 
the receiving optical system (EL) thereof in such a way 

that the emitted light grazes the receiving optical 
system approximately tangentially, 
a receiving circuit (E-Sch) which amplifies the output 
signal of the opto-receiver (LE) and feeds it to a 

microcomputer (µR) which drives the two opto-transmitters 
(LS1, LS2) in an alternating fashion and digitizes (ADW) 

the received signal for the purpose of further processing, 
the microcomputer (µR) storing the measured smoke 

density values (MWR) and using a linearization table in  
 

the read-only memory (EPROM) to determine the value of 
the atmospheric humidity from the measured signals for 

the atmospheric humidity (MWF) and storing said value as 

a measured humidity value (MWF).
