<ABSTRACT>
The drink-dispensing device proposed has a casing (10) designed to hold a bag (22) containing a drink. Fitted to the bag (22) is a tap (24) which penetrates via an aperture (28) through the casing (10). Disposed on the bag (22) is a cooling element (32) which not only cools the drink but also has an indicator (38), visible from outside, which shows how much drink has been taken from or remains in the bag (22).

Drink-dispensing device, with a housing (10) 
which has a passage (28) for a spout (24) and which is 

intended to receive a tight bag (22) which comprises the 
spout (24) and in which the drink is stored, characterized 

by a cooling element (32) which is intended to lie 
upon the bag (22) in the interior (20) of the housing 

(10), and an indicator device (38, 40, 42) which is 
connected to the cooling element (32) and which is for 

indicating the amount of drink which has been used up or 
which still remains. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the cooling element (32) has a receptacle (34) for 

receiving a cooling medium (36), preferably ice cubes. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the receptacle (34) is made of thermally conductive 

material, preferably aluminium. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the housing (10) has a thermally 

insulating layer. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that there is a gap present between the 

housing (10) and a bag (22). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the housing (10) has an indicator 

opening (40) or an indicator window, and the cooling 
element (32) is connected to a marker (38) which can be 

seen from the outside through the indicator opening (40) 
or the 
indicator window. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6,  
 

characterized in that the base (14) of the housing (10) 
has an opening (30) in order to simplify the insertion of 

the spout (24) into the passage (28). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the housing (10) has, at the 

passage (28), a holding member (44) for the spout (24). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that a pedestal element (60) is arranged
