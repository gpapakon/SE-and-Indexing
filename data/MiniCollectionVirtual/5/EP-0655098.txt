<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE; FRAME FOR SIGNThe present invention relates to a frame for supporting a sign and in particular though not exclusively a sign used to provide a warning of roadworks or other excavations.Utilities and local authorities are now statutorily obliged to provide signs warning both car-users and pedestrians of roadworks and other excavations. The signs which may be triangular flat plastic sheets are mounted on frames usually of steel. One type of frame has a sign-supporting face to which the sign is attached or mounted together with supporting legs for holding the sign upright.The present variety of frames are expensive and as they are frequently removed or damaged by vandals the cost of replacement can be prohibitive.It is an object of the present invention to provide a frame which is less expensive than the present frames so that the cost of replacing lost and damaged frames is reduced.According to the present invention we provide a frame for supporting a sign, the frame comprising three members which are interconnectable in such a way as to form a three-sided figure with one side forming a base and at least one of the other sides forming a mounting for the sign. 

Preferably at least one of the frame sides is disconnectable from an adjacent side to enable the frame to be collapsible.Suitably each member is in the form of a hoop which conveniently is of tubular section.The hoop may be of polyethylene.Preferably the hoops are of different diameters so that on collapse the hoops rest one within another.An embodiment of the invention will now be particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:-Figure 1 is a view from the rear and to one side of an assembled frame,Figure 2 is a view of a side of the assembled frame, andFigure 3 is a view from above and to one side of a collapsed or folded down frame after or before use.Referring to the drawings, the frame 1 comprises three hoops 2, 3 and 4 which are interconnected to each other by means of connectors 5, 6 and 7 as shown in Figure 1. Each hoop is made of a tubular plastic material such as polyethylene. This may take the form of a length of pipe the ends of which are welded 

 together to form the hoop. The pipe, preferably of 25mm external diameter, may be waste or scrap gas service pipe material used to replace or renew existing metallic service pipes. Thus the manufacturing cost of the frame can be negligible. The hoops are of different diameters, hoop 2 being of the smallest diameter, hoop 3 being of intermediate diameter and

CLAIMS
1. A frame for supporting a sign comprises three members which are interconnectable in such a way as to form a three sided figure with one side forming a base and at least one of the other sides forming a mounting for the sign.
2. A frame as claimed in claim 1 in which at least one of the sides is disconnectable from an adjacent side to enable the frame to be collapsible.
3. A frame as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 in which each member is in the form of a hoop.
4. A frame as claimed in claim 3 in which the hoop is of tubular section.
5. A frame as claimed in claim 4 in which the hoop is of polyethylene.
6. A frame as claimed in any of claims 3 to 5 in which the hoops are of different diameters so that on collapse the hoops nest one within another.
7. A frame substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the drawings.
