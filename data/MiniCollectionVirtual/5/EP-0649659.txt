<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed herein relates to a rapamycin formulation for intravenous
injection (iv). In one aspect the invention comprises a concentrate solution of rapamycin
in propylene glycol, in combination with a diluent consisting of a polyoxyethylene
sorbitan ester, polyethylene glycol 400 and water, all in given proportions as described
below.Rapamycin is a macrolide antiobiotic produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus
which was discovered first for its properties as an antifungal agent. It adversely affects
the growth of fungi such as Candida albicans and Microsporum gypseum.. Rapamycin,
its preparation and its antibiotic activity were described in U.S. Patent No. 3,929,992,
issued December 30, 1975 to Surendra Sehgal et al. In 1977 Martel, R. R. et al. reported
on immunosuppressive properties of rapamycin against experimental allergic
encephalitis and adjuvant arthritis in the Canadian Journal of Physiological
Pharmacology, 55, 48-51 (1977). In 1989, Calne, R. Y. et al. in Lancet, 1989, no. 2, p.
227 and Morris, R. E. and Meiser, B. M. in Medicinal Science Research, 1989, No. 17,
P. 609-10, separately reported on the effectiveness of rapamycin in inhibiting rejection in
vivo in allograft transplantation. Numerous articles have followed describing the
immunosuppressive and rejection inhibiting properties of rapamycin, and clinical
investigation has begun for the use of rapamycin in inhibiting rejection in transplantation
in man.Rapamycin is insoluble in water and is only slightly soluble in solubilizers, such
as propylene glycol, glycerin and PEG 400, commonly used in preparing parenteral
formulations. It is only sparingly soluble in PEG 300 and is insoluble or very slightly
soluble in commonly used aqueous injectable co-solvent systems, such as, 20%
ethanol/water, 10% DMA/water, 20% Cremophor EL®/water and 20% polysorbate
80/water. For these reasons clinically and commercially acceptable injectable
formulations of rapamycin have been difficult to make. An injectable composition of
rapamycin is described in European Patent Publication No. 0041795, published
December 16, 1981. In this injectable formulation rapamycin is first dissolved in a low
boiling point organic solvent, namely, acetone, methanol or ethanol. This solution is
then mixed with a nonionic surfactant selected from polyoxyethylated fatty acids;
polyoxyethylated fatty alcohols; and polyoxyethylated glycerin hydroxy fatty acid esters,
e.g. polyoxyethylated castor oil, exemplified by Cremophor® EL and polyoxyethylated
hydrogenated castor
