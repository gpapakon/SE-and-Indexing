<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shirred, tubular film conditioned ready for filling coextruded in at least two layers for encasing fillings packaged in the liquid or pasty state, in particular sausage meat emulsion, containing at least one outer layer which predominantly comprises hydrophilic, aliphatic polyamide and containing at least one further layer having a water vapour-barrier character, characterised in that the polyamide portion of the outer layer has a water content which corresponds to the saturation concentration of the polyamide and the surface of the outer layer is wetted with a shoring lubricant made of an aqueous oil emulsion.

<CLAIMS>
A shirred, at least two-layered coextruded tubular
film, conditioned ready for filling, for wrapping

contents packed in liquid or paste-like condition, in
particular sausage meat, the film containing at least

one outer layer consisting predominantly of
hydrophilic, aliphatic polyamide which can absorb at

least 8 wt.% water before it is saturated, and
containing at least one other layer acting as a

barrier to water vapour, characterised in that, as a
result of the application of an aqueous oily emulsion

during the shirring process, the polyamide component
of the outer layer has a water content which

corresponds to the saturation concentration of the
polyamide and the surface of the outer layer is wetted

with a shirring lubricant made of the aqueous oily
emulsion.
A shirred tubular film conditioned ready for filling
according to claim 1, characterised in that it is

biaxially stretched.
A shirred tubular film conditioned ready for filling
according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that it is

thermofixed completely or to such an extent that the
residual shrinkage can be thermally initiated.
A shirred tubular film conditioned ready for filling

according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the outer polyamide layer

consists substantially of polyamide 6 and/or
copolyamides based on caprolactam and/or mixtures of

the same. 
A shirred tubular film conditioned ready for filling
according to at least one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that one or more layers acting as a
barrier to water vapour consist of polyethylene or

polypropylene or of copolymers based on ethylene or
propylene or of mixtures of the same.
A shirred tubular film conditioned ready for filling
according to at least one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that the oily emulsion used for
shirring on the outer polymer layer consists

substantially of water and oil and optionally contains
one or more emulsifiers for the oil.
A shirred tubular film conditioned ready for filling
according to claim 6, characterised in that the oily

emulsion used for shirring contains olive oil, linseed
oil, palm oil, sunflower oil or coconut oil and/or a

paraffin oil or silicone oil.
A shirred tubular film conditioned ready for filling
according to at least one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that it is shirred by means of
standard, wobble plate, axial or screw tightening

processes.
The use of the tubular films according to any of
claims 1 to 8 as sausage casings.
