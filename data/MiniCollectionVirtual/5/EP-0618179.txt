<ABSTRACT>
2.1. For the protection of building materials, synthetic products such as organosilicon compounds and polymers are used. Problems arise in particular on sandstones bound by carbonate and clay. The building protection agents available today often lose their effect after a few years. The new building protection agent is to make possible impregnation with a high penetration depth and to fulfil a hydrophobicising (waterproofing) and strengthening function. 2.2. A prepolymer comprising a (meth)acrylate ester, an ethylenically unsaturated monomer which bears an epoxide function and, if desired, an ethylenically unsaturated alkoxysilane group, where the (meth)acrylate ester is present in an amount of from 48 to 98% by weight and the epoxydic monomer is present in an amount of from 0.5 to 50% by weight, is suitable for impregnating porous building materials. The prepolymer can be used together with a crosslinker. The prepolymer has a low viscosity 
<
 10 cP, is soluble in many solvents and has a high penetration depth with good hydrophobicisation and strengthening of the building material. The prepolymer forms a polymer film 3 which binds together individual stone elements 1 and leaves pores 2 free. 2.3. Impregnation of building materials, building protection.
