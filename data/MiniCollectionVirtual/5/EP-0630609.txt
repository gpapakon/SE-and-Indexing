<ABSTRACT>
Blood lancet device for obtaining blood samples for diagnostic purposes, comprising a housing (10), a lancet holder (11) which is movable in the housing (10) for mounting of a lancet (4), and a lancet drive for driving the puncturing and withdrawal movement of the lancet holder (11). At the front end in the puncturing direction the housing has an exchangeable skin contact member (5) provided with a contact surface (42) for pressing it on to the skin during use of the blood lancet device (1). The skin contact member (5) and the lancet (4) form part of a disposable part (3) intended for single use and insertable in a handling step at the front end (2) of the housing (10). The disposable part (3) is designed such that the lancet (4) can be inserted only together with the skin contact member (5). In order to rule out reliably any re-use of any component of a blood lancet device that could come into contact with the blood of the patient it is proposed, according to the invention, that the skin contact member (5) and the plastic lancet body (31) in the disposable part (3) are connected to form a unit and that a first intended breaking point, via which the skin contact member and the lancet body can be separated from one another after insertion of the disposable part (3), is provided at the connection point between the skin contact member (5) and the lancet body (31).

Blood lancet device (1) for withdrawing blood for
diagnostic purposes, comprising


a housing (10),
a lancet holder (11), movable within the housing
(10), for holding a lancet (4) which comprises a lancet

body (31) made of a plastics material and a lancet
needle (33) fixed in the lancet body (31)

and
a lancet drive (12) to drive the puncturing and
retraction movement of the lancet holder (11) with a

lancet (4) held therein,

in which
the housing (10) has, at its anterior end (2) in the
puncturing direction, an exchangeable skin-contact

part (5) with an outlet opening (6) for the lancet
(4), said skin-contact part (5) being provided with a

contact surface (42) for pressing against the skin
when using the blood lancet device (1), and

the skin-contact part (5) and lancet (4) form components
of a disposable item (3) for once-only use

which can be inserted at the anterior end (2) of the
housing (10) in a single handling operation, said

disposable item (3) being designed in such a way that
the lancet (4) can be inserted only together with the

skin-contact part (5),
characterized in that
 
in the disposable item (3), the skin-contact part (5)

and the lancet body (31) are connected to one another
forming an unit and at the point of connection between

the skin-contact part (5) and the lancet body
(31) a first predetermined breaking section (52) is

provided by means of which the skin-contact part (5)
and the lancet body (31) are separable from one

another following insertion of the disposable item
(3).
Blood lancet device according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the lancet (4) has a tip-protection cap
(7) made of a plastics material, which is connected

with the lancet body (31) via a second predetermined
breaking section (53), and both predetermined breaking

sections are separable following insertion of
the disposable item (3).
Blood lancet device according to claim 2, 
characterized
in that
 the disposable item (3) is designed in
such a way that the first predetermined breaking section

(52) and the second predetermined breaking section
(53) are separable in a single handling operation.
Blood lancet device according to claim 3, 
characterized
in that,
 following insertion of the disposable
item (3), the lancet (4) in the lancet holder (11) is

non-rotatably mounted and a rotation-limiting stop
(58) for the skin-contact part (5) is provided at the

anterior end (2) of the housing (10), both predetermined
breaking sections being separable by rotation

of the tip-protection cap (7) relative to the lancet
(4) and the skin-contact part (5). 
Blood lancet device according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the lancet drive
(12) has means (64) for ensuring that repeated tensioning

of the lancet drive (12) is possible only after
removal of a lancet (4) which during the preceding

puncturing and retraction movement was located
in the lancet holder (11).
Blood lancet device according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the skin-contact
part (5) is designed as a ring-shaped part (41),

which essentially forms only the anterior face of the
housing (10).
Disposable item for once-only use with a blood lancet
device (1) comprising


a lancet (4) which comprises a lancet body (31) made
of a plastics material and a lancet needle (33) fixed

in the lancet body (31) and,
located at the anterior end of the blood lancet device
in its puncturing direction, an exchangeable

skin-contact part (5) with an outlet opening (6) for
