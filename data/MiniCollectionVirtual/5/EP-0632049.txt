<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing 3-methyl-1-phenylphospholene 
oxide by subjecting dichlorophenylphosphine and isoprene to an addition 

reaction and then subjecting the resulting adduct to solvolysis, 
wherein the addition reaction between dichlorophenylphosphine and 

isoprene is conducted in a solvent to obtain an adduct in the form of a 
slurry or solution and the slurry or solution is subjected to solvolysis. 
This process can easily produce 3-methyl-1 -phenylphospholene 
oxide which is used in various reactions, and is free from the 

drawbacks of the conventional process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 3-methyl-1-phenylphospholene
oxide.Phospholene oxides having a basic structure represented
by the following formula

are useful compounds which are used as a catalyst in various reactions.
Use of 1-phenylphospholene oxide or 3-methyl-1-phenylphospholene
oxide as a catalyst effective for conversion of an organic diisocyanate
into a polycarbodiimide is disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 348934/1992, and use of 3-methyl-1-phenylphospholene
oxide as a catalyst effective for conversion of an
organic diisocyanate into a polycarbodiimide is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Application Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 9252/1993.Of the phospholene oxides having the basic structure represented
by the above formula, 3-methyl-1-phenylphospholene oxide 

or

is thought to be advantageous in reactivity. The 3-methyl-1-phenylphospholene
oxide having a double bond at the 3-position has
been produced by a process represented by the following reaction
formula, shown in Organic Synthesis, 43, 73 (1963).
That is, said 3-methyl-1-phenylphospholene oxide has
been produced by reacting dichlorophenylphosphine (1) and isoprene 
(2) in the presence of an antioxidant to form a solid adduct (3), hydrolyzing the adduct,
neutralizing the reaction mixture, extracting the neutralized mixture with chloroform,
and drying the extract and subjecting it to distillation.The above conventional process, however, has various problems. Since isoprene
(a starting material) is incorporated inside the solid adduct, the solid adduct
must be ground and the ground adduct must be washed with, for example, petroleum
ether for isoprene removal before the hydrolysis step; this makes the process
complicated and moreover there arises the leakage of isoprene vapor during grinding
and washing, deteriorating the working environment.With respect to the above conventional process, a problem of yield is also
pointed out. That is, the yield remains as low as about 57-63% even when there are
used such controlled reaction conditions as (a) isoprene is used in an amount of
about 3 moles per mole of dichlorophenylphosphine and (b) the reaction is conducted
at room temperature for 5-7 days or even longer. The yield becomes even
lower when the reaction time is shortened or the amount of isoprene is decreased.Thus, in order to obtain 3-methyl-1-phenylphospholene oxide in an economical
yield by the above-mentioned process, isoprene must be used in excess. Consequently,
isoprene is incorporated inside
