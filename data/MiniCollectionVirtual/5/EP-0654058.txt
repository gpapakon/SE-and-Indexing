<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polymeric peroxycarbonates, a process 
for making the polymeric peroxycarbonates and initiator compositions 
comprising these polymeric peroxycarbonates. The polymeric 
peroxycarbonates of the present invention provide significant 
advantages in the polymerization of vinyl monomers. Several types of polymeric peroxides are known in the prior art. For 
example, in Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 60, 5293d and 10892e (1964) one 
finds diacyl-type polymeric peroxides obtained by reaction of a 
chloride of an aliphatic dibasic acid and sodium peroxide. Ester-type 
polymeric peroxides are known, for example, from European Patent 
applications 0 384 660 and 0 364 169. Further, from Zh. Org. Khim., Vol. 13, No. 9, page 1,842 (1977) it is 
known that the reaction of an aliphatic or aromatic dibasic acid 
chloride with 2,5-dimethylhexane-2,5-dihydroperoxide results in the 
production of the corresponding polymeric peroxy ester. A similar 
preparation process is also disclosed in U.S. patent 3,117,166. Also known are a wide variety of polymers which contain several 
peroxide groups therein. Examples of acyl peroxide-containing 
polymers can be found in U.S. patent 4,304,882. Peroxycarbonate 
group-containing polymers can be found in Japanese patent application 
J5 8023-807 and U.S. patent 3,879,353. However, none of these 
publications discloses the peroxycarbonate polymers of the present 
invention. None of the foregoing polymeric peroxides offer a combination of low-temperature 
initiation, storage stability and high molecular weight 
polymer products which is satisfactory for a wide range of 
applications. Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a 
specific peroxycarbonate polymer which exhibits a unique combination 
of properties which makes it particularly suitable for polymerization 
of vinyl monomers.  
 The present invention relates to a polymeric peroxycarbonate which 
comprises at least two structural units represented by the formula I: 
 
wherein R is selected from C1-C6 alkylene, alkyne, alkadiyne, 
1,3-phenylene, 1,4-phenylene, cis- or trans-alkene, and alkadiene; R1 
and R2 are independently selected from C1-C6 alkyl, C6-C10 aryl and R1 
and R2 may combine to form a C3-C12 alkyl ring; and R3 is selected 
from (A)-(F): 
 
wherein R4 and R5 are independently selected from C1-C6 alkyl, C6-C10 
aryl and R4 and R5 may combine to form a C3-C12 alkyl ring; R6 is 
selected from methylene, 1,4-phenylene, 
 
and 
 
wherein R7 is selected from hydrogen and methyl;
