<ABSTRACT>
A docking module for removable disk drives 
provides, in one embodiment, space for two such disk 

drives within a standard half-height bay. The docking 
module provides cammed insertion and removal together with 

hot swappability of disk drives. Alterative embodiments 
provide ten or more disk drives at a density of two drives 

per half-height bay.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
U.S. Patent Application S.N. 07/764,590, filed 
September 24, 1991, entitled High Capacity, Low Profile 
Disk Drive System, which is incorporated herein by 
reference. This application relates to disk drives 
generally, and particularly relates to docking modules for 
removable disk drives. Mass storage requirements for computers have 
matured substantially since the introduction of the 
personal computer. In the current computing environment, 
whether for large systems or personal computers, typical 
requirements for mass storage devices are in the hundreds 
of megabytes to several gigabytes. In conjunction with 
such mass storage requirements are the data security 
issues which require that these large mass storage devices 
be backed up in one way or another to ensure that there is 
minimal loss of data even in the event of a system 
failure. There are several ways to achieve these goals. 
A conventional approach for the mass storage device is one  
 
or more fixed disk drives permanently mounted within a 
chassis. A typical approach for data backup is a tape 
drive providing archival storage. In some high end 
systems, such as file servers, it is known to provide 
mirrored drives, in which two functionally identical 
drives are installed with one drive serving as the backup 
to the other drive. In many such systems, a tape backup 
is also provided to provide archival storage. There are a number of difficulties with these 
approaches to mass storage and backup devices. One 
difficulty with permanently installed drives is that, in 
the event of a failure, the entire system must be taken 
down to replace the drive; even if the system includes 
mirrored drives, it is generally not recommended to 
disconnect a permanently installed drive while the system 
is powered up. Part of the problem relates to the fact 
that the drives are installed within the cabinet, and are 
not readily accessible without substantial disassembly of 
the system. A second difficulty involves the availability of 
multiple drive bays for a system. In a conventional 
system, the number of drive bays available for mass 
storage devices can be fairly limited. While oversized 
cabinets have been built to accommodate the desire for 
multiple, large drives, the trend toward smaller, more 
compact systems is at odds with the desire for large 
storage capacities. A third difficulty with permanently installed 
drives is that the capacity is limited to a specific 
number of megabytes. Even if a

<CLAIMS>
A docking module for use with removable disk 
drives comprising: 

   a housing member having a plurality of slots 
therein, each slot configured to receive a removable disk 

drive; 
   a door rotatably mounted within the housing and 

configured to serve as a lever arm; 
   a slide mounted within the housing and connected 

to the door so that rotation of the door causes at least a 
portion of the slide to move forward and back w
ithin the 
housing; 

   connection means for electrically connecting the 
removable disk drive to a host; and 

   engagement means for urging the disk drive into 
the connection means when the door is closed, and urging 

the disk drive out of the connection means when the door 
is opened. 
A method for providing hot swappability of disk 
drives comprising: 

   establishing a tri-state condition on a bus; 
   detecting the insertion of a disk drive; 

   supplying power to the disk drive; and 
   removing the tri-state condition by connecting 

the bus to the disk drive. 
A docking module for use with removable disk 
drives comprising: 

   a housing having at least two slots, each 
capable of receiving internally therein a drive having a 

nominal width of 4 inches, a nominal depth of 5.75 inches, 
and a nominal height of one-half inch; 

   at least two doors for insertion of removable 
disk drives; and

 
   connection means for connecting the disk drives 

to a host system.
