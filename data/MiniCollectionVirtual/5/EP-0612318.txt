<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to heteroarylpiperidines,
pyrrolidines and piperazines. More particularly, this
invention relates to heteroarylpiperidines, pyrrolidines and
piperazines having antipsychotic activity and to their use as
antipsychotic drugs.The therapeutic treatment of schizophrenic patients by
administration of neuroleptic drugs, such as chlorpromazine,
haloperidol, sulpiride, and chemically closely related
compounds, is widespread. While control of schizophrenic
symptoms has been successful, treatment with these drugs does
not cure the psychotic patient, who will almost certainly
relapse if medication is discontinued. There exists a
continuing need in the art for antipsychotic drugs for the
treatment of psychoses.Moreover, some of the known neuroleptics produce
unwanted side effects. For example, the side effects of many
antipsychotic drugs include the so-called extrapyramidal
symptoms, such as rigidity and tremor, continuous restless
walking, and tardive dyskinesia which causes facial
grimacing, and involuntary movements of the face and
extremities. Orthostatic hypotension is also common. Thus,
there also exists a need in the art for antipsychotic drugs
that produce fewer or less severe manifestations of these
common side effects.GB 2163432 discloses the synthesis of compounds of formula
 
wherein R2 is lower alkyl or H, R3 and R4 are independently chosen from H,
lower alkyl, lower acyloxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkyl thio, halogen, OH or
CF3. They are expected to possess an analgesic activity.In the following, the term 'lower' is equivalent to the expression 'C1-C6'.This invention aids in fulfilling these needs in the art
by providing the use of a compound of the formula:

wherein
X is -O-, -S-,
R2 is selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl,
aryl lower alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, aroyl, alkanoyl, and
phenylsulfonyl groups;p is 1 or 2;Y is hydrogen, lower alkyl, hydroxy, chlorine, fluorine,
bromine, iodine, lower alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, nitro, or
amino, when p is 1;Y is lower alkoxy, hydroxy and halogen when p is 2 and X
is -O-;Q1 is
 
where Z is

andY2 is

in which n is 1 or 2; R4 to hydrogen or

all geometric, optical and stereoisomers therreof 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.This invention also aids in fulfilling these needs in
the art by providing a compound of the formula:

wherein
X is -O-, -S-,
R2 is selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl,
aryl lower alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, aroyl, alkanoyl, and
