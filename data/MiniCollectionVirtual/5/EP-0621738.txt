<ABSTRACT>
A security element (15) is provided as security for a tubular heater when running dry or in the case of another unacceptable handicap for the heat transfer, which security element consists of a heating resistor made of PTC material. It is thermally coupled in the same or a similar manner to the medium as the remaining heating resistor. In the case of an unacceptably reduced heat transfer the temperature rises rapidly due to the current impressed in the PTC element (15) and leads to the self-destruction of the security element.

Safety device for an electric heating element (11) so as to prevent an
inadmissible temperature drop through the medium to be heated, with at

least one heating resistor (14) and a fuse (15) connected in series therewith,
which is located in an area cooled by the medium and/or is thermally

coupled to the heating resistor (14) or components (12) heated by it and in
which the fuse contains a resistor with positive temperature characteristics

of the electric resistance behaviour (PTC), characterized in that
the PTC resistor having clearly pronounced, positive temperature characteristics

is constructed as a blowout fuse and its electrical resistance, in
the normal operation of the heating element (11), represents below 2% of

the overall resistance of the heating element (11).
Safety device according to claim 1, characterized in that the fuse (15)
is placed in a tubular heater (11), preferably in the end region thereof

and is preferably constructed as a coil embedded in compressed insulating
material (13) within the casing (12) of the tubular heater (11).
Safety device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the fuse
(15) is axially connected to the helical heating resistor (14), optionally

by means of a connecting piece (22).
Safety device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the fuse (15) is placed on a support (16).
Safety device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the electrical resistance of the fuse (15), in the normal operation of

the heating element, represents below 1% of the overall resistance of the
heating element.
Safety device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the fuse (15) is made from a material, whose specific electrical

resistance in a temperature range above the normal operating temperature of
the heating element has a resistance increase preferably exceeding in

jump-like manner the up to then existing resistance increase with rising 
temperature, such as an iron-cobalt-based material, particularly Co-25Fe.
Safety device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the PTC material of the fuse (15) covers a resistance range of 0.05 to

2 ohm mm
2
/m and/or has a specific resistance increase between 20 and
1000Â°C of more than 5 times, preferably more than 10 times.
