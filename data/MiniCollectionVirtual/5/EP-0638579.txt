<ABSTRACT>
Triphenylphosphine (TPP) is obtained from a solution of a triphenylphosphine-aluminium chloride complex in chlorobenzene by decomplexation, hydrolysis and extraction by means of water and subsequent separation of the liquid/liquid dispersion - consisting of a chlorobenzene phase containing TPP and a water phase containing Al and Cl compounds - into a chlorobenzene phase containing TPP and into a TPP-free water phase containing Al and Cl compounds, characterised by   - dispersing water in the chlorobenzene phase in a 1st mixing device in the ratio of 0.6 to 0.95 kg of water per kg of chlorobenzene solution such that as a result of the hydrolysis a temperature in the range from 60 to 90 DEG C is established, residence times of 5 to 30 minutes and energy densities of 2 to 10 kW/m

<CLAIMS>
A process for isolating triphenylphosphine (TPP)
from a triphenylphosphine/aluminum chloride complex

dissolved in chlorobenzene by decomplexation, hydrolysis
and extraction using water and subsequent separation of

the liquid/liquid dispersion, which is composed of a
TPP-containing chlorobenzene phase and of an Al and Cl

compound-containing aqueous phase, into a TPP-containing
chlorobenzene phase and into a TPP-free, Al and Cl

compound-containing aqueous phase, wherein

water is dispersed in the chlorobenzene phase in a
ratio of 0.6-0.95 kg of water per kg of chlorobenzene

solution in a 1st mixing apparatus in such a way
that the temperature resulting from the hydrolysis

is in the range from 60 to 90Â°C, the dispersion
being carried out with holdup times of 5-30 minutes

and energy densities of 2-10 kW/m
3
,
a second dispersion is carried out in a 2nd mixing
apparatus with holdup times of 5-60 minutes and

energy densities of 0.05-0.5 kW/m
3
, and
the heavier TPP-containing chlorobenzene phase is
separated from the lighter TPP-free, Al and Cl

compound-containing aqueous phase in a phase separator.
