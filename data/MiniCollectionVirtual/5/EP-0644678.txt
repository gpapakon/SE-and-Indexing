<ABSTRACT>
So that a receiver for ASK-modulated signals achieves high input sensitivity at minimum circuit cost, an envelope detector is provided whose non-linear component (VD) is a controlled reactance. A receiver of this type can be used advantageously in "On Board Units" of road users and in the stationary receiving installations in traffic information and control systems.

<CLAIMS>
Receiver for ASK-modulated microwave signals,
which has an envelope curve detector having at least

one non-linear element, characterized in that the non-linear
element (VD, VD1, VD2) is composed predominantly

of a controlled reactive impedance.
Receiver according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the non-linear element (VD, VD1, VD2) is a

varactor diode.
Receiver according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the non-linear element (VD, VD1, VD2) forms a

resonant circuit together with a planar antenna
(A, A1, A2) connected to it.
Receiver according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that two non-linear elements

(VD1, VD2), which are each coupled to their own
antenna (A1, A2), are operated in a push-pull mode, and

in that an adder (AD) combines the signals detected on
the non-linear elements (VD1, VD2).
Receiver according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the coupling of a planar

antenna (A) on one side of a substrate (S) to a planar
supply line (LE) on the opposite side of the

substrate (S) is provided via a varactor diode (VD)
which is connected to the antenna (A) and passes

through the substrate (S).
