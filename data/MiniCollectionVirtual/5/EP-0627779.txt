<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sealed type nickel-metal
hydride alkaline storage cell including a negative
electrode comprised of a hydrogen-storage alloy capable of
absorbing and desorbing hydrogen reversibly, particularly to
an improvement of cell characteristics of the sealed type
nickel-metal hydride alkaline storage cell.Along with a development of the information-oriented
society, a number of sophisticated functions are applied to
portable electronic devices such as a cordless telephone, a
word processor, a laptop computer, and a video camcorder.
However, advantages and a further development of these portable
electronic devices will not be confirmed without improving
cells as the power source or backup source. Conventionally,
nickel-cadmium storage cells have been commonly applied to
portable electronic devices. However, to meet the recent
demand of highly efficient cells, nickel-hydride cells (nickel-metal
hydride alkaline cells) are becoming more popular, since
they have a higher energy density, and the operation voltage
is substantially same as that applied to nickel-cadmium storage
cells. However, the conventional sealed type nickel-hydride 
cells have the drawbacks in that they do not work well under
unfavorable temperature conditions, also the cells are forced
to be unworkable by a cell safety vent operated if they are
charged continuously under an unfavorable condition for a long
time.The drawbacks of the convention sealed type nickelhydride
alkaline cells will be described hereinbelow. First
of all, the nickel-hydride cells must be sealed to be applied
to portable electronic devices; however, in order to seal the
cells, the capacity of the cell must be governed by the
positive electrode. The reason for this is stated now.During the continuous charge, the positive electrode is
fully charged first, since its capacity is smaller than the
capacity of the negative electrode. If the cell continues to
be charged even after this, the positive electrode will be
over-charged, and oxygen gas is generated from the positive
electrode [Equation (1)]. The oxygen gas moves from the
positive electrode to the negative electrode through a
separator, and generates water when it is reacted with the
hydrogen included in the hydrogen absorbing alloy, which has
some parts uncharged [Equation (2)]. The generated water is
consumed by the negative electrode according to its usual
charge reaction [Equation (3)]; therefore, the oxygen generated
from the positive electrode will not be accumulated inside the
cell.
