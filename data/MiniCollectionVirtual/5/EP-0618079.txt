<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal transfer 
imaging, and in particular to a novel thermal dye and 
thermal mass transfer receptor sheet for such printing 
using an opaque microporous thermal insulating film 
beneath a dye receiving layer to reduce unwanted heat 
loss and to improve the formation of dye (and pigment 
in binder) images with better color uniformity and 
densities on the dye or pigment receiving layer. The 
film is transparentizable and is therefore also 
suitable for making transparencies and transferable 
(e.g., laminable) images with exceptionally high color image 
densities. The process for making this type of thermal 
transfer is also disclosed. There is a growing interest in electronic color 
imaging for technologies that are dry processable and 
environmentally friendly. Among them, direct thermal, 
thermal mass transfer, thermal dye transfer, and dry 
silver imaging are the most practical and well-received 
processes. In all of these processes, heat is the main 
driving force that generates visible images. 
Therefore, these imaging processes are strongly 
dependent on how efficient the heat is utilized for 
imaging without unnecessary heat losses to the 
surrounding areas. In thermal dye transfer imaging, an image is 
formed on a receptor sheet by selectively transferring 
a dye to a receptor sheet from a dye donor element 
(sheet or ribbon) placed in intimate contact with the  
 
receptor sheet. Material (e.g., dye) is transferred 
from the donor element, e.g., the ribbon, upon 
localized heating (such as that directed by a thermal 
print head, which consists of small electrically heated 
elements [print heads]). Heat generated momentarily 
from these elements is transferred through the dye 
donor to the dye receiving layer and the base of the 
receptor in several milliseconds. The thermal energy 
is used to heat and mobilize the dye, to soften the 
interpolymeric cohesion, and to open up free space in 
the resinous binders used in the donor dye layer and 
dye receiving layer allowing passage and "parking room" 
for the traveling dye molecules. Temperature plays a 
critical role here; the higher the temperature, the 
higher the dye image density. Thermal dye transfer systems in general have 
advantages over thermal mass transfer systems in that 
the former is capable of producing high quality, 
continuous tone, full color images. However, the 
systems suffer from two major drawbacks that impair 
their ability to make truly photographic quality color 
hardcopies. One of the
