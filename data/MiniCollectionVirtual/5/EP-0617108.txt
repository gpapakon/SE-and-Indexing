<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improved 
single component phosphor for use in cathode ray tubes 

(CRTs) which are employed in the recording of information, 
typically a tricolor-decomposed color photograph, onto 

photographic print material. Typically, a CRT is used as 
the source of optical radiation (light) employed to expose 

the image (record the information) onto the photographic 
print material. More particularly, the present invention is 

directed to the chemical composition of the phosphor 
deposited on the faceplate of the CRT and the relation of 

its optical properties to the characteristics of the 
photographic print material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
single component phosphor for use in cathode ray tubes 
(CRTs) which are employed in the recording of information, 
typically a tricolor-decomposed color photograph, onto 
photographic print material. Typically, a CRT is used as 
the source of optical radiation (light) employed to expose 
the image (record the information) onto the photographic 
print material. More particularly, the present invention is 
directed to the chemical composition of the phosphor 
deposited on the faceplate of the CRT and the relation of 
its optical properties to the characteristics of the 
photographic print material. It is known to form a hardcopy image, which can 
take the form of a transparency or a reflection print, from 
a tricolor-decomposed digital representation of the original 
image which is then exposed onto a photographic media. A 
system for generating such images is shown in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,726,675 and generally comprises a monochromatic 
cathode ray tube (CRT). Each color component of the 
original image, for example, blue (B), green (G) and red 
(R), of the tricolor-decomposed digital representation of 
the original image, is sequentially converted to a pattern 
of light on the monochromatic CRT which is collected and 
focused onto a photosensitive medium, such as a photographic 
film or paper, by an optical system. A plurality of color 
filters which each transmit a selected color, for example, 
blue, green and red, are sequentially inserted into the 
light path so that light only of that color corresponding to  
 
the tricolor component of the image being displayed on the 
CRT is transmitted to the photosensitive medium. Following 
the exposure of the photographic medium to each of the light 
components, the photosensitive medium is processed to obtain 
a color transparency or a reflection print. The referenced 
patent teaches the use of a phosphor whose spectral output 
is matched to the photosensitive print medium, particularly 
to the use of a mixture of two fluorescent substances, the 
first composed of (Y.Gd)O₂S:Tb and the second selected from 
Y₂O₃:Eu or Y₂O₂S:Eu. It has been found that the use of mixtures of 
phosphors has the disadvantage that the dispersibility of 
the different phosphors is poor and they tend to form 
aggregates upon the preparation of the fluorescent surface 
resulting in spatial nonuniform emission of light of each of 
the colors. Homogeneous mixtures of multi-component 
phosphors are both difficult to make and difficult to 
maint
