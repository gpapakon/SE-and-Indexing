<ABSTRACT>
A wall furniture item comprises at least one pair of attachment 
devices (14) for attachment to a retaining element (20, 22) fixed 

to the wall, in which each of said attachment devices (14) 
comprises a coupling element (15) position-adjustable in terms of 

both depth and height and arranged to engage said retention 
element (20, 22) fixed to the wall. According to the invention, 

the coupling elements (15) of said attachment devices (14) are 
interconnected by a bar (19) to be hooked to said retention 

element (20, 22) fixed to the wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention comprises a wall furniture item with a wall
attachment system comprising a bar position-adjustable in terms of
height and depth.Preferably but not necessarily, the wall furniture item according
to the present invention is a kitchen furniture unit.To wall-mount an item of wall furniture it is known to the expert
of the art to use an attachment device in which a coupling element
is articulatedly secured to a frame or plate and is position-adjustable
relative to said plate.The plate is arranged to be fixed to the side panel and possibly
also to the top panel of the item, either to the rear or to the
front of the back panel (depending on whether the attachment
device is to be hidden or exposed), whereas the coupling element
freely engages a channel-shaped bar, or hooks or hook plugs fixed
to the wall, or to a member suitable for this purpose.The aforesaid attachment devices are provided with linkages
comprising operating screws for adjusting the vertical position of
the coupling element relative to the plate, or its length, or the
angle formed between the plate and the coupling element, in 
accordance with the extent of opening of this latter.Said operating or adjustment screws are accessible either from the
interior of the furniture item, or through one or more holes
formed in the back panel in the case of a hidden attachment
device.In this manner it is possible, within certain limits, to adjust
the position of the wall furniture item in terms both of depth and
height, after it has been mounted on the wall by engaging the
coupling elements of the attachment devices fixed to the item side
panels with the bar or hook plugs fixed to the wall.Attachment devices of the aforesaid briefly described type are
illustrated for example in German patents 2,717,169, 3,036,984 and
3,111,357, in EP-A-389054 and in US-4143846.The coupling element of attachment devices of the known art is
easily and comfortably engagable with a channel-shaped bar fixed
to the wall, but if individual hook plugs or bar hooks are used,
it is essential for the hook plugs or the successive hooks on the
bar to be in a predetermined position apart corresponding to the
distance between the axes of the furniture item attachment
devices.This means that bars Fixed to the wall have to be provided with hooks at a distance
apart corresponding to that between the attachment devices on the
furniture item, or that the hook plugs have to be fixed into the
wall with extreme accuracy.The general object of the present invention is to obviate the
