<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a castor including a wheel (2) which can be pivoted about a vertical pivot axle (3) substantially orthogonal to the rotation axle (4) of the wheel (2) and offset with respect to the latter, a support bearing (8) exhibiting at least one annular dish (9, 10) which is fixed via its central part onto the lower end of the said pivot axle (3), a support clevis (6) exhibiting at least one lateral cheek (5), the lower end of which bears the said wheel (2) and also exhibiting a skirt (7) located around the said lower end of the pivot axle (3), the said skirt (7) being connected to the upper end of the said cheek (5) and interacting with rolling-contact bearing members (11, 13) of the said bearing (8), and means (16) for locking the pivoting of the said wheel (2) with respect to the said pivot axle (3) in at least one predetermined position, the said locking means (16) comprising a leafspring (17), characterised in that the leafspring (17) is located in the space lying between the support bearing (8) and the tread (2a) of the wheel (2) and articulated via its middle part on the clevis (6), the said leafspring (17) including a first end (19) pressed onto the skirt (7) and a second end (20) including a locking device (21) capable of engaging in a depression (23) provided on the annular dish (9, 10).

Swivel castor comprising a wheel (2) adapted to pivot about a 
vertical pivot pin (3) substantially orthogonal to the axle (4) of the wheel (2) 

and offset with respect thereto, a support bearing (8) presenting at least one 
annular dish element (9, 10) which, via its central part, is fixed on the lower 

end of said pivot pin (3), a supporting fork joint (6) presenting at least one 
lateral cheek (5) whose lower end bears said wheel (2) and also presenting 

a skirt (7) disposed around said lower end of the pivot pin (3), said skirt (7) 
being joined to the upper end of said cheek (5) and cooperating with the 

rolling members (11, 13) of said bearing (8), and means (16) for blocking 

the pivoting of said wheel (2) with respect to said pivot pin (3) in at least one 
predetermined position, said blocking means (16) comprising a spring blade 

(17), which is disposed in the space included between the support bearing 
(8) and the tread (2a) of the wheel (2), characterized in that the spring blade 

(17) is articulated by its median part on the fork joint (6), said spring blade 
(17) comprising a first end (19) bearing on the skirt (7) and a second end 

(20) comprising a blocking lock (21) capable of engaging in a depression 
(23) provided on the annular dish element (9, 10). 
Castor according to claim 1, characterized in that the skirt (7) 
comprises means (25) for guiding the blocking lock (21). 
Castor according to claim 2, characterized in that said guide 
means (25) comprise a notch made in the skirt (7). 
Castor according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the spring blade (17) is mounted on the fork joint (6) by means of a hinge 

pin (18) disposed parallel to the axle of the wheel (2). 
Castor according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the spring blade (17) comprises lateral tabs (26) presenting embossed 

portions (27) cooperating with openings made in the fork joint (6). 
Castor according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the blocking lock (21) bears via the spring blade (17) on the free edge 

(22) of the annular dish element (9, 10) and in that at least one depression 
(23) for blocking is provided in said free edge (22). 
Castor according to claim 6, characterized in that said 
depression (23) presents inclined ramps (24) in order to allow unblocking of 

the pivoting of the wheel (2) by a torque exerted on the fork joint (6) or on 
the pivot pin (3).  

 
Castor according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
the blocking lock (21) is formed in the wall of the spring blade (17). 
Castor according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that it 
further comprises means for adjusting the force exerted by the spring (17). 
Castor according to claim 9, characterized in that the means for 
adjusting the force of the spring comprise an adjusting screw cooperating 

with the skirt. 
Castor according to claim 4, characterized in that the hinge pin 
(18) is pivotable and comprises at least one cam (42) on which the spring 

blade (17) is articulated. 
Castor according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterized in 
that the spring blade (17) comprises at its second end (20) a pedal (41) 

allowing manual unblocking of the pivoting of the wheel (2).
