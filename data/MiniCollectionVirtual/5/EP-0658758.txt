<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for in-situ endpoint detection of an 
etching of a film on a substrate is disclosed. The apparatus 

comprises a means for providing a first excitation beam of 
light having a prescribed wavelength, the first light beam 

substantially containing only a first harmonic component 
thereof. A directing means directs the first light beam at 

a prescribed incident angle to an interface between the film 
and the substrate, the first light beam being reflected off 

the interface to thereby provide a second light beam, the 
second light beam containing the first harmonic component of 

the first light beam and a generated second harmonic 
component. A detecting means detects the generated second 

harmonic component and provides a first output signal 
representative thereof. A means for producing a generated 

second harmonic component reference of the first light beam 
provides a second output signal representative of a generated 

second harmonic component reference. A normalizing means 
responsive to the first and second output signals normalizes 

the detected second harmonic component of the first light 
beam in real-time, providing a third output signal 

representative of an occurrence of a prescribed change in the 
normalized detected second harmonic component, the prescribed 

change corresponding to an etching endpoint of the film on 
the surface of the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to optical 
measurements, and more particularly, to a method and 
apparatus for detection of an endpoint in the fabrication of 
integrated circuits. Modern integrated circuit devices are complex structures 
formed by many repeated steps of material deposition, 
reaction, modification (e.g., annealing), and removal. These 
processes are common to the fabrication of integrated circuit 
devices. While typical dimensions of lateral features in 
integrated circuit devices are frequently in the range of 
several microns, the thickness of fabrication layers is often 
far smaller than this scale, sometimes down to the range of 
10 nanometers. A thickness of 10 nm corresponds to 
approximately 50 atomic layers. It can be easily understood 
that precise measurement of the dimensions during processing 
is crucial to device performance and device yield in the 
manufacturing process. One of the critical general issues during the manufacture of 
an integrated circuit device is the detection of a boundary 
during the removal of material. Material removal may occur 
by methods such as chemical etching or by a plasma process 
such as reactive ion etching. It is generally necessary to 
determine the time at which all of the desired material has 
been removed and for which the underlying layer has not been 
etched significantly. This determination generally 
constitutes detection of an end point.  In the removal of material, the etched material and the 
underlying material are frequently made of different 
compositions, such as silicon dioxide on a silicon layer. 
They may, however, differ primarily in their crystalline 
structure or doping level and not in their gross chemical 
composition. This poses particular challenges for end point 
detection during an etching process. For example, in the 
manufacture of bipolar transistors, the fabrication step of 
forming an emitter opening involves etching an area of a 
deposited layer of polycrystalline silicon down to an 
epitaxial (single crystal) layer. This operation may be 
performed by a wet chemical etching bath which does not 
present any obvious means for real-time etching end point 
detection. The consequences of improper etching are, however, 
significant. Underetching will cause a degradation of the 
gain of the transistor, while over etching will result in a 
degraded contact between the intrinsic and extrinsic base 
regions. End point detection of etching is therefore 
important and critical for preventing over etching and
