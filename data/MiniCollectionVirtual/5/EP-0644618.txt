<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector includes a dielectric 
housing (10) having generally rigid walls (18, 20) defining 

an elongated terminal-receiving passageway (16a, 16b). At 
least one latch wall (22a, 22b) is disposed within and 

extends longitudinally of the passageway. The latch wall 
defines opposite longitudinal edges thereof, with one 

longitudinal edge (24) being integrally joined to the 
generally rigid walls of the housing. The other 

longitudinal edge (26) of the latch wall is free and 
projects into the passageway for transverse flexing about 

the one joined edge. A latch shoulder (28a) is provided on 
the latch wall at least on a flexing portion of the wall. 

A terminal (14) is adapted to be inserted into the passageway. 
The terminal has a latch shoulder (42) for snapping 

behind the latch shoulder of the latch wall to prevent 
removal of the terminal from the passageway.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a latching
system or means for holding terminals in passageways of a
connector housing.A wide variety of mating electrical connectors
employ pairs of interengaging pin and socket terminals for
interconnecting a plurality of circuits or wires through
the mated connectors. The pin and socket terminals often
are called male and female terminals, respectively.The terminals are mounted in a plurality of
terminal-receiving passageways in a dielectric housing of
the electrical connector. The terminals generally are
elongated and are inserted into the passageways along the
longitudinal axes of the terminals. Some form of latch
means normally are provided to hold the terminals in the
passageways against withdrawal therefrom.Various types of terminal latch means have
consistently presented various problems. For instance, the
terminals often are provided with outwardly projecting,
cantilevered flexible latch arms which snap behind shoulders
within the terminal-receiving passageways of the
connector housing. The cantilevered latch arms have a
tendency to bend, break and/or snag on other parts. For
instance, the latch arms may be bent or collapsed on a reel
of interconnected terminals during shipping, prior to
fabricating the connector. In addition, in order to have 
any significant latching capabilities, the latch arms must
be of a sufficient width which often limits the width of
the contact portions of the terminals and, in turn, causes
over-heating.A connector with a centilevered latch arm is, for instance, known from DE-U-85 20 470 against which claim 1 is delimited.In order to avoid those problems wherein the
latch means are provided by cantilevered flexible latch
arms on the terminals, cantilevered latch arms have been
provided on the connector housing itself. The housing
normally is molded of plastic material, and the
cantilevered latch arms are molded integrally therewith and
extend inwardly into the terminal-receiving passageways
from interior housing walls. These cantilevered latch arms
on the housing have limited strength and durability. They
also present problems during manufacture, because the
molded plastic material must flow down the entire length of
the arms. The arms also take up "real estate" within the
connector housing and make it difficult to provide adequate
insulation between adjacent terminals.This invention is directed to solving the above
myriad of problems by providing a simple and reliable
latching

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector which includes

a dielectric housing (10) having generally rigid
wall means (18, 20) defining an elongated terminal-receiving

passageway (16a, 16b),
a terminal (14) adapted to be inserted
longitudinally into the passageway, the terminal having a

longitudinal axis (33) and a mating portion (32) adapted to
mate with a complementary terminal inserted into the

passageway, and
latch means to hold the terminal in the terminal-receiving
passageway in the housing,
at least one latch wall (22a, 22b) disposed
within and extending longitudinally in the terminal-receiving

passageway of the housing, the latch wall
defining opposite edges thereof, one

edge being joined to the generally rigid
wall means of the housing, the other edge

being free and projecting into the passageway for
transverse flexing about the one joined edge and a latch

shoulder (28a) on at least a flexing
portion of the latch wall,

and
said terminal (14) including a latch shoulder
(42) for snapping behind the latch shoulder of the latch

wall when said terminal is inserted longitudinally into
said passageway to prevent removal of the terminal from the

passageway, characterised in that the edges are the longitudinal edges (24, 26) of the latch wall and in that the latch wall is adapted to be located
between said rigid wall means (18, 20) and said terminal

(14) when said terminal is inserted into said passageway.
In an electrical connector as set forth in
claim 1, wherein said latch shoulder (28a) on the latch

wall is defined by a latch boss (28) projecting
transversely into the terminal-receiving passageway.
In an electrical connector as set forth in
claim 1, including a pair of said latch walls (22a, 22b)

extending along opposite sides of the terminal-receiving
passageway (16a, 16b).
In an electrical connector as set forth in
claim 1, wherein said dielectric housing (10), including

said generally rigid wall means and said latch wall, is
unitarily molded of plastic material, whereby a

longitudinal integral juncture (24) between the rigid wall
means and the latch wall defines a living hinge for
 flexing
of the latch wall.
In an electrical connector as set forth in
claim 1, wherein said terminal (14) includes a male mating

end (32), a terminating end (34) and an intermediate body
portion (36) between the ends, the latch shoulder (42) on

the terminal being located on the intermediate body portion
thereof.
In an electrical connector as set forth in
claim 5, wherein said terminal (14) comprises a stamped and

formed sheet metal component.
