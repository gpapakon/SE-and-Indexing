<ABSTRACT>
The instant invention concerns an industrial sewing 
machine of the type comprising a double clamp (1) for 

gripping and transporting the patch and the fabric on 
the work surface (2), this clamp being applied to the 

front of a trolley, connected both to the slide of a 
cross shaped table, activated by a motor (10) by means of a 

toothed belt (9), and to the rack rod of a reel-rack 
kinematic pair, activated by a motor; this sewing 

machine is characterised by the fact that the 
aforementioned cross shaped table is positioned above 

the trolley and fixed below a support plate (7), in its 
turn screwed below the projecting arm (8) of the sewing 

machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention concerns an industrial
numerically controlled sewing machine under the head
of which there is fixed a cross shaped supporting
table for the trolley which transports the double
clamp used for the sewing of patch pockets.In order to better underline the advantages offered by
the machine according to the invention, it is
considered important to briefly describe the
structrural configuration and the functioning of the
industrial machines currently used for the automatic
sewing of patches, like for example pockets, on fabric
or leather.These special machines are fitted with a double clamp,
supported and sliding along the work surface, and
fixed to a trolley able to carry out movements along
the axes (x and y) of a cartesian plane and namely in
the left-right direction (x axis) or in the forward-backward
direction (y axis).This double clamp is made up of one plate for the
clamping of the support and a second plate, which
works inside the first plate, for the clamping of the
patch; more precisely, the larger clamp support plate
is fitted with a central window exactly the same size
as the patch to be sown.The patch fixing plate is similar in shape to the
aforementioned window, but smaller, in such a way as
to be able to leave a perimetral surround free, which
is used by the needle in the sewing phase. The double clamp has two functions:
to separately clamp the patch and the support fabric
on the sewing work surface;to pull the patch and the support fabric along a
closed curved path which coincides exactly with the
sewing line to be followed.The transport trolley, to which said double clamp is
applied is connected to two distinct motorization
groups, one intended to impose transversal movements
in a straight line along the x axis, the other
intended to impose longitudinal movements in a
straight line along the y axis.The group which enables the trolley to move in the
longitudinal direction ( forwards and backwards) is
positioned above the work surface and comprises a
reel-rack kinematic pair, activated by a motor flanged
to the bearing column of the sewing machine.More precisely, the abovementioned rack-rod protrudes
from the front of this column and is fixed to the back
of a transversal bracket, which supports the
transversal bars used to sustain and guide the clamp-holding
trolley.The group which enables the trolley to move in the
transversal direction (left-right) is positioned below
the work surface and comprises a cross-shaped table,
fitted with its own motorization, which provides
