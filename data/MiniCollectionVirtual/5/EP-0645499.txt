<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an installation for dispensing water onto the ground, for cleaning or for fire safety, this installation being characterised in that the washing water is taken from a water storage tank (1) so as to be conveyed under pressure through a feed pipe (2) to a tank (3) situated in a high position; the tank (3) is coupled to a distribution circuit (4) with which there is associated at least one nozzle (5) for distribution to the ground; the water pouring out of the nozzle (5) onto the ground (6) is collected back into the water storage tank (1). The cycle for distributing water to the ground may be repeated several tens of times with the same water which is recycled. The water consumption with respect to the number of cycles carried out with the said water is approximately 1 litre of water per cycle for 5 m
