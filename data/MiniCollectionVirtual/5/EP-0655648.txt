<ABSTRACT>
Photographic elements comprising certain 2-phenylcarbamoyl-1-naphthol 
image-modifying couplers 

exhibit proper hue, a resistance to dye 
crystallization, and a resistance to leuco cyan dye 

formation. Such couplers can be utilized for their 
image-modifying effect and can contribute substantially 

to the overall dye density of an image.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic
elements and to novel two-equivalent 2-phenylcarbamoyl-1-naphthol
image-modifying couplers.Modern photographic materials, particularly
color negative films, contain a variety of so-called
image modifying couplers including development
inhibitor releasing (DIR) couplers, switched or timed
inhibitor releasing (DIAR) couplers, bleach accelerator
releasing couplers (BARCs) and colored masking
couplers. DIR couplers, such as those described in
U.S. Patent 3,227,554, and DIAR couplers, such as those
described in U.S. Patent 4,248,962, perform such useful
functions as gamma or curve shape control, sharpness
enhancement, granularity reduction and color
correction. BARCs, such as those described in European
Patent Application 193,389, facilitate the oxidation of
developed silver in bleach solutions. They may also
enhance silver developability, thereby affecting gamma
(contrast). Masking couplers, such as those described
in J. Opt. Soc. Am, 40, 171 (1950) and in U.S. Patent
2,428,054, are used to correct for the unwanted
absorptions of various imaging dyes.Modern color negative films often contain
both image couplers, which contribute solely to the
production of dye, and image-modifying couplers, such
as those described above. The image-modifying
couplers, in addition to having an image modifier
component (e.g. bleach accelerator or development 
inhibitor), also comprise an image dye parent. In
films which comprise both image couplers and image-modifying
couplers, much of the ultimate color density
exhibited by the film is often derived from the parent
of the image-modifying coupler.Many films today contain large amounts of
such image-modifying couplers in the red-sensitive,
cyan-dye-containing layers. These image-modifying
couplers typically have cyan image dye parents which
generate cyan dye upon reaction of the image-modifying
couplers with oxidized developer. Because such cyan
dye substantially contributes to the total red density
in these films, it is important that the dyes generated
from the image-modifying couplers have suitable
properties. Desirable properties include good hue,
good stability, resistance to reduction in seasoned
bleaches or in bleaches of low oxidizing strength, and
resistance to hue changes on storage at low
temperatures.Resistance to reduction in seasoned bleaches
is particularly important because certain cyan dyes are
prone to being reduced by ferrous ion complexes (such
as ferrous EDTA) and other reducing agents, which are
found in seasoned
