<ABSTRACT>
A solid-phase anchor carrying nucleic acids which can amplify the amount of nucleic acid probes on a solid-phase 
support and is satisfactorily usable in the separation and purification of DNA-binding proteins on a practical 

scale and in gene cloning; and a method of adjusting the anchor. The anchor contains a solid-phase support provided 
with an amplifier group having a number of branching ends, each of which has a binding group which can be bound 

to a functional group positioned at one end of a nucleic acid fragment to be bound to a predetermined nucleic acid 
probe. By appropriately selecting the amplifier group, it is possible to form hundreds to thousands of binding groups 

at one binding site of the solid-phase support and thus mount a number of nucleic acid probes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anchor for 
immobilizing nucleic acids, capable of immobilizing or 
deimmobilizing a vast amount of DNA required for the 
separation and purification of DNA binding proteins and 
for DNA cloning, and to a method for preparing the same. cDNA cloning having been frequently carried 
out in recent years requires preliminary extraction and 
purification of mRNA. For such purpose, a single 
stranded oligo-dT immobilized onto a solid phase has 
been available currently. In such case, mRNA should be 
once separated and purified prior to subsequent cDNA 
synthetic process. Because the separation and 
purification process involves more or less mRNA 
decomposition with a resultant lower recovery, the 
process still remains within the range of conventional 
plate screening.  For isolation of a protein binding to a double 
stranded DNA having a specific nucleotide sequence or 
for detecting or separating an objective DNA by using a 
nucleic acid probe, a highly efficient and simple 
process of immobilizing a double stranded DNA onto a 
solid carrier is a very useful technique. However, such 
technical process has not yet been known. Furthermore, cDNA synthesis on the basis of 
mRNA isolated by using oligo-dT attached onto a solid 
carrier has frequently been done in recent years. In 
this case, mRNA is purified after its preliminary 
dissociation from the immobilized oligo-dT. Then, the 
thus purified mRNA is used for cDNA synthesis. It 
should be expected that if such reaction is done in a 
solid state, the efficiency and yield of the reaction 
may be distinctively elevated, but conventional oligo-dT 
is problematic because a double stranded cDNA as the 
final product cannot be separated readily from such 
solid carrier. Alternatively, it is known for example in 
Japanese Patent Application No. H3-147800 an anchor for 
immobilizing a nucleic acid, capable of enzymatically 
binding the nucleic acid to a solid carrier along with a 
method for preparing the same.  When cloning is done by a solid phase method, 
it is evident that nucleic acid probes as well as 
desired DNA fragments are used as in the form of double 
stranded DNAs in most cases and that nucleic acid probes 
on a solid phase are attached to the solid carrier while 
the desired DNA fragments are suspended in solution. In the hybridization of a desired DNA fragment 
with a nucleic acid probe on a solid carrier, therefore, 
the probability that a single stranded DNA from the 
desired DNA fragment hybridizes with the
