<ABSTRACT>
A fuel cell includes an electrolyte layer (1) in form of a plate, an 
oxygen 

electrode (2) formed on one surface of the electrolyte layer, a fuel 
electrode (3) formed 

on the other surface of the electrolyte layer, and a conductive 
separator (4) opposed 

to the oxygen electrode or fuel electrode for defining 
oxygen-containing gas 

passages or fuel gas passages. The separator includes a plate-like 
portion (4a) opposed 

to and spaced from the oxygen electrode or fuel electrode, a pair of 
strip-shaped 

projections (4b) extending along opposite ends of the plate-like portion 
for contacting 

opposite edges of the electrolyte layer, and a plurality of ridges (4c) 
for defining gas 

passages in form of grooves between the pair of strip-shaped 
projections. A 

fuel cell system includes a plurality of such fuel cells stacked one 
over another 

in a spaced relationship to define fuel gas passages or 
oxygen-containing gas 

passages in between. A flexible conductive element is disposed between an 
adjacent pair of the fuel cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fuel cells and a fuel cell system. More
particularly, the invention relates to fuel cells each including an electrolyte layer
in the form of a plate, an oxygen electrode applied to one surface of the electrolyte
layer, a fuel electrode applied to the other surface of the electrolyte layer, and a
gas passage defining device formed of a conductive material and opposed to the
oxygen electrode or fuel electrode for defining oxygen-containing gas passages
or fuel gas passages; and to a fuel cell system using such cells.Fig. 11 shows a cell C of this type known in the art.This cell C includes a separator 31 formed of a conductive material and
having a plate portion 31a and a pair of strip-shaped projections 31b extending
along opposite ends of the plate portion 31a. The separator 31 is attached to an
oxygen electrode 2 (or fuel electrode 3), with the strip-shaped projections 31b
contacting opposite edges thereof, respectively. A plurality of conductive
columnar members 32 are arranged between the separator 31 and oxygen electrode
2 (or fuel electrode 3). Thus, the separator 31 and oxygen electrode 2 (or fuel
electrode 3) are connected in conductive state to each other, with a plurality of
groove-like oxygen-containing gas passages "s" (or fuel gas passages "f") formed
between the pair of strip-shaped projections 31b.That is, a gas passage defining device R is formed of the separator 31 and
the plurality of columnar members 32 formed separately from the separator 31.A fuel cell system is composed of a plurality of such cells C stacked one 
over another in a spaced relationship to define fuel gas passages "f" (or oxygen-containing
gas passages "s".However, the conventional fuel cells involve a high manufacturing cost
since the separator and columnar members must be manufactured separately.
Furthermore, the cell manufacturing process is complicated by the necessity to
arrange the plurality of columnar members between the separator and oxygen
electrode (or fuel electrode) in addition to a step of attaching the separator to the
oxygen electrode (or fuel electrode).Moreover, since the oxygen electrode and fuel electrode are formed porous
to be permeable to gases, it is necessary to seal positions of contact between the
strip-shaped projections and oxygen electrode (or fuel electrode) to prevent gas
leakage. This further complicates the cell manufacturing process.In JP-A-2 195 656, there is a fuel cell disclosed where gas passage defining ridges are integrally
formed with the
