<ABSTRACT>
A method for processing domestic garbage 
characterized by the steps of sorting the garbage into 

two or more classes and placing each class into a unified 
domestic container (10). The container (10) is divided 

into a respective number of compartments (12, 14). The 
containers (12, 14) are transferred to a garbage dump 

site and dismembered into their compartments. Each 
compartment (12, 14) is transferred to its respective 

garbage class treatment location.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
domestic garbage collecting and processing. Ecological as well as energy and natural 
resources preservation considerations play a more 
and more intensive roll in the direction of altering 
the traditional processing methods relating to the 
collection and discarding of domestic garbage. One 
of the main developments has been expressed by State 
or Municipal Regulations, directed to enforce a 
change in the collection habits of the public. In 
general, directives has been issued in more and more 
countries to compel the individual households to 
perform a selection or sorting of the garbage into 
two or more classes, each requesting a separate type 
of treatment. The sorting of the garbage at its 
source enabled a subsequently different treatment of 
every class in a more economic manner with regard to 
the processing thereof, be it complete discarding 
(burning, burying), recycling or reusing. Sorting at 
the source became a milestone in the struggle of 
mankind towards less pollution and waste of precious 
energy. At present, the pre-sorting of garbage is 
effected in a most primitive fashion, namely that 
the household owner puts one class into a first 
container, another class into a second container,  
 
etc.; the containers are usually plastic bags, which 
are then carried down to the building collecting 
location and put into separate receptacles, from 
which they are emptied into the garbage trucks, 
during their usual rounds on their way to the dump 
site. The containers of the different classes are 
distinctly marked, to facilitate their subsequent 
separation and different methods of treatment. A further development or refinement of this 
approach has been introduced concerning a garbage 
collecting timetable imposed by the municipal 
authorities, limiting the collection to once or 
twice a week, compelling the citizens to conform by 
allowing the garbage to be taken out only at the 
night, preceding the prescribed collection day. This compulsive garbage handling routine 
imposes a considerable amount of inconvenience on 
the public at large. It is therefore the prime 
object of the present invention to improve the pre-sorting 
operation of garbage in making it more 
convenient -- and thereby more likely to be adhered 
to by the public -- and more economic regarding the 
handling at the garbage dump sites. It is a further object of the invention tp 
provide an improved container for use in the 
proposed method. It is a still further object of

<CLAIMS>
A method of processing domestic garbage 
characterized by the steps of sorting the garbage 

into two or more classes, placing each class into a 
unified domestic garbage container (10) comprising a 

respective number of compartments, collecting and 
transferring the container to a garbage dump site, 

dismembering the container into its compartments, 
and transferring each compartment to its respective 

garbage class treatment location. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the container 
is in the form of a bag (10) made of a pliable sheet 

material having an envelop portion (12a, 14a) and an 
open mouth portion (12b, 14b). 
A method as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the bag (10) 
is made of plastics. 
A method as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the bag (10) 
comprises a series of integrally formed pockets (12, 

14). 
A method as claimed in Claim 4 wherein the pockets 
(12, 14) are seamed to each other at their open 

mouth portions (12b, 14b). 
A method as claimed in Claim 5 wherein the bag (10) 
is closable by a tying strip (18). 
A method as claimed in Claim 6 wherein the said 
dismembering is effected by cutting the tied-together 

portion (16) of the bag (10) to thereby 
separating the bag (10) into its respective number 

of pockets (12, 14). 
A method as claimed in Claim 7 wherein the bags (12, 
14) are loaded on movable conveying means (22), and 

adapted to become sliced during movement by 
stationary cutting means (24), each separated pocket 

(12, 14) being transferred by separate conveying 
means (26, 28) to a predetermined destination. 
A multi-compartment container for use in the method 
as claimed in Claim 1, the container being in form 

of a bag (10) made of a pliable material, subdivided 
into at least two pockets (12, 14). 
A multi-compartment container as claimed in Claim 9 
wherein the bag is made of p
lastic sheet material. 
A multi-compartment container as claimed in Claim 10 
wherein the said pockets (12, 14) are integrally 

formed with the bag (10). 
A multi-compartment container as claimed in Claim 11 
wherein the bag has an elongated open mouth portion 

(12b, 14b) and an envelop body portion (12a, 14a) 
said pockets (12, 14) being seamed to each other 

along the said mouth portion (16). 
A multi-compartment container (10) as claimed in 
Claim 11 wherein each pocket (12, 14) is of a 

different color. 
A multi-compartment container as claimed in Claim 11 
wherein the material of each pocket (12, 14) is of a 

different texture.
