The invention relates to the heat treatment of the body (2) of a preform (1) or of an intermediate container made of thermoplastic material during a process for manufacturing a container, such as a flask or a bottle, especially by blowing or drawing-blowing; the entire body (2) of the preform is heated to a temperature above the softening temperature of the material and at least one longitudinal portion (13) of the body (2) of the preform, rotating about itself, is at an even higher temperature than that of the rest (14) of the body, this enabling a final container with a body of complex shape to be obtained.

Process for the heat treatment of the body (2) of a preform 
(1) or of an intermediate container made of a thermoplastic 

material during the course of a fabrication process for a 
container (1
3
), such as a flask or bottle, notably by blow-moulding 
or drawing and blow-moulding, a heat treatment 

during the course of which the preform is rotated about 
itself and moved through a heating oven (5) such that the 

whole body (2) of the preform (1) is heated to a 
temperature above the softening temperature of the 

material,
 
characterized in that at least part of the length of the 

body (2) of the preform (1) rotating about itself (18, 20) 
is caused to pass alternately in front of heating zones (6, 

26) and zones of lesser or no heating (21, 25) situated at 
least to one side of the displacement path (D) of the 

preform (1) through the heating oven (5), such that at 
least one longitudinal portion (13) of the preform body, or 

several longitudinal portions circumferentially separated 
from one another, extending over at least the said part of 

the length of the body, is raised to a temperature even 
higher than that of the rest of the body, the spacing (d) 

of the heating zones being determined as a function of the 
longitudinal portions (13) of the preform body that have to 

be heated preferentially and of the perimeter of the body 
(2) of the preform, such that the longitudinal portions 

(13) of the preform body to be heated preferentially come 
before the successive heating zones (6, 26) during the 

combined displacement and rotation movement of the preform 
while the longitudinal portions between them (14) that have 

to be heated less come before the successive zones of 
lesser or no heating (21, 25), thanks to which there are 

created in the body (2) of the preform (1) or the 
intermediate container one or more longitudinal portions 

(13) which are relatively hotter, alternating with 
intermediate longitudinal portions (14) which are  

 
relatively less hot, the former being able to deform more 

easily than the latter during the subsequent deformation of 
the preform body, this making it possible to fabricate 

containers of complex body shape (not rotationally 
cylindrical) with a wall thickness (e) which is 

approximately the same all over. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
displacement speed of the preform (1) and its speed of 

rotation about itself are approximately constant, and in 
that the heating zones (6, 26) are spaced apart at 

essentially fixed intervals (d). 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
from at least one side of the oven (5), the preform bodies 

are heated discontinuously by successive heating zones (6) 
spaced apart along the displacement path (D) of the 

preform, which constitute the aforesaid heating zones. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in that on at 
least one side of the oven are provided several successive 

means of heating (6) spaced apart along the displacement 
path of the preform. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in that on at 
least one side of the oven there are continuous means of 

heating, in front of which are successive screens spaced 
apart along the displacement path of the preform. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the preform body is heated (6) from one side of the 

oven, and in that from the opposite side of the oven the 
heat radiation is reflected in successive reflecting zones 

(26) spaced apart along the displacement path (D) of the 
preform, which constitute the aforementioned heating zones. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in that on the  
 

said opposite side of the oven several successive 
reflectors (26) are provided, spaced apart along the 

displacement path of the preform. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in that on the 
said opposite side of the oven an essentially continuous 

reflector is provided and in front of it there are 
successive non-reflecting screens spaced apart along the 

displacement path of the preform. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in that on the 
said opposite side of the oven an essentially continuous 

non-reflecting wall (25) is provided and in front of it 
there are successive reflectors (26) spaced apart along the 

displacement path of the preform. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that at 
least one annular portion (36) of the body (2) of the 

preform or intermediate container, or several annular 
portions spaced longitudinally apart from one another, is 

raised to a temperature lower than that of the remainder of 
the body, thanks to which in the body of the preform or 

intermediate container there are one or more annular 
portions (36) relatively less hot, alternating with 

relatively hotter annular portions, the former being able 
to deform less easily than the latter during a subsequent 

deformation of the preform body, which makes it possible to 
fabricate containers whose body has at least one 

circumferential reinforcement zone (39) of increased 
thickness. 
Process according to Claim 10, which is put into operation 
by setting the preform into rotation about itself (20) and 

displacing it (D) through a heating oven, characterized in 
that the body of the preform is heated from one side of the 

oven, and in that from the opposite side of the oven the 
heat radiation is not reflected by at least one non-reflecting  

 
zone in the form of a strip (42) extending 

essentially parallel to the displacement direction (D) of 
the preform and situated opposite at least one annular 

portion (36) of the body (2) of the preform which must be 
relatively less hot, whereas the heat radiatio
n is 
reflected by at least one reflecting zone in the form of a 

strip (41) extending essentially parallel to the 
displacement direction of the preform and situated opposite 

the remainder of the preform body which must be relatively 
hotter.
