<ABSTRACT>
Self-laminating data-tags having a polyester substrate coated with a 
pencil receptive writing surface and a non-conducting reinforcer are 

obtained. Provisions are made for protecting the writing surface, replicating 
the data and removing the data-tag. Such data-tags are particularly useful as 

warning tags for utility equipment and in severe environmental conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to data-tags or labels for the utility 
industry, and more particularly to a self-laminating polyester data-tag having 
a pencil receptive writing surface and a reinforcing grommet for use in 
severe environments. The utility industry uses warning data-tags or labels in a variety of 
situations to instruct personnel that a potentially dangerous situation exists. 
For example, when a piece of equipment or a transmission line is disabled 
so that it can be serviced, the service person attaches a lock or warning tag 
to the switch while he is servicing the line or equipment, often at a remote 
location not visible from the switch. The workers will not accidentally re-energize 
the equipment while the lock or tag is present. The use of such tags is mandated not only by common sense, but in 
some instances government regulations require their use. A suitable data-tag should be constructed from materials which are 
resistant to severe environmental conditions and non-hazardous. The design 
of the tag should be such that the instruction posted on it is protected from 
the environment, clearly visible and readable under adverse lighting 
conditions, and tamper-resistant, over an extended period of time. 
Eventually the tag may have to be removed or destroyed because the need 
for a warning is eliminated and a means for so doing should be provided. In 
many applications provisions for duplicating the information on the tag 
should be incorporated. The most common type of data-tag presently being used is a vinyl 
tag. Vinyl has the advantages of being readily available to tag manufacturers 
and relatively inexpensive. However, we have found that vinyl is not strong 
enough in some situations. For example, when the tag is applied to switches 
on utility transmission lines in coastal or other high wind areas, the tag may 
rip and blow off the line. This type of failure may have fatal consequences. 
Vinyl also becomes brittle when exposed to ultra-violet rays, such as 
sunlight. Adding UV absorbers to vinyl is a possible solution, but vinyl 
with such absorbers is less commonly available and more expensive. We have found that polyester is a better material for manufacturing 
warning tags. Polyester has a much higher tear resistance than vinyl.  
 
Polyester may discolor after long term exposure to the sun, but does not 
become as brittle as vinyl, and therefore provides a much more secure tag. 
Polyester has a much higher melting point than vinyl. Therefore polyester 
can be used in

A durable, non-conducting self-laminating data-tag resistant to 
wet and windy weather conditions and to tampering for securely attaching to 

a piece of equipment to provide instructions to users comprising: 
   a tear resistant, environmentally stable, polyester substrate from 

about 5 mils (0.125mm) to about 15 mils (0.375 mm) thick having a 
mounting hole for receiving a fastener; 

   a non-conducting, strong, plastic grommet less than about 200 mils 
(5mm) thick mounted in said mounting hole for preventing substrate damage 

by the fastener and imparting pull strength to the data-tag, whereby the 
plastic grommet securely locks on the data-tag and is hard to disassemble; 

   a receptive coating on said polyester substrate for writing thereon 
whereby pencil markings are shown in a blacker, more durable form; and 

   a sheet of clear material overlying said receptive coating and 
adhesively attached thereon and not extending beyond said substrate thereby 

forming a laminate for protecting the receptive coating and the readability of 
the instructions thereon. 
The data-tag of Claim 1 in which the polyester substrate is at least 
10 mils (0.25 mm) thick. 
The data-tag of Claim 1 comprising a pencil receptive coating on 
at least a portion of the substrate for permitting information to be recorded on 

the tag after manufacture. 
The data-tag of Claim 1 comprising a stress concentrating notch 
for assisting a user to start a tear in the substrate for removing the tag. 
The data-tag of Claim 4 having a generally rectangular shape in 

which the mounting hole is adjacent a first edge of the substrate and the 
stress concentrating notch is adjacent a second edge. 
The data-tag of Claim 1 in which the sheet of clear material 
comprises an adhesive layer and a removable protective sheet covering the 

adhesive layer. 
The data-tag of Claim 6 having a generally rectangular shape in 
which the sheet of clear material is attached to the substrate adjacent a first 

edge of the substrate. 
The data-tag of Claim 6 comprising indicia relating to the use of 
the tag printed on the removable protective sheet. 
The data-tag of Claim 1 comprising a printed form having 
luminescent indicia on the polyester substrate. 
The data-tag of Claim 1 further comprising a removable form 
attached to the tag. 
The data-tag of Claim 10 in which the removable form is 
attached to the substrate by a line of perforations. 
The data-tag of Claim 10 further comprising carbon paper or 
carbonless-type coated paper for replicating information entered on the tag 

and on the removable form simultaneously. 
The data-tag of Claim 1 in which the substrate and the sheet of 
clear material have matching rounded corners to reduce the tendency of the 

sheet of clear material for delaminating from the substrate. 
The data-tag of Claim 1 having a generally rectangular shape 
comprising a plurality of mounting holes formed adjacent the edges of the 

tag. 
A durable, non-conducting self-laminating data-tag resistant to 
wet and windy weather conditions and to tampering for securely attaching to 

a piece of equipment to provide a visible warning comprising: 
   a tear resistant, environmentally stable polyester substrate from about 

10 mils (0.25mm) to about 15 mils (0.375 mm) thick; 
   a layer of pencil receptive material comprising titanium dioxide coated 

on the substrate whereby pencil markings are shown in a blacker, more 
durable form; 

   a sheet of clear material adhesively attached to the substrate at a first 
end and free from the substrate at a second end, the second end overlying the 

layer of pencil receptive material and not extending beyond said substrate; 
   a layer of adhesive material on the sheet of clear material; 

   a removable protective sheet covering the unattached end of the clear 
material thereby forming a laminate for protecting the receptive coating and 

the readability of the instructions thereon; and 
   a non-conducting, two piece, plastic snap-grommet less than about 

200 mils (5mm) thick, 
   in which the plastic grommet occupies a mounting hole extending 

through the clear sheet and substrate adjacent the first end, reinforcing the 
hole, preventing substrate damage and providing a means for receiving a 

fastener; and 
   in which the substrate is provided with a notch in an edge of the 

substrate for initiating a tear.
