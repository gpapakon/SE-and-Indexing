<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bromination process and more particularly 
to a process for the bromination of methyl 2-(2-methylphenyl)-3-methoxypropenoate. A process for brominating (E)-methyl 2-(2-methylphenyl)-3-methoxypropenoate 
with bromine in chloroform in the presence of azodiisobutyronitrile 
and light is described in EP-A-0278595. A process for brominating 
(Z)-methyl 2-(2-methylphenyl)-3-methoxypropenoate to form (E)-methyl 
2-(2-bromomethylphenyl)-3-methoxypropenoate using N-bromosuccinimide is 
described in EP-A-0299694. The side chain bromination of aromatic 
molecules with a bromine complex of poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) is 
described in J. Org. Chem. 1986, 51, 929-931. According to the present invention there is provided an improved 
process for preparing a compound of formula (I) which comprises contacting 
with bromine the (E)- or (Z)-isomer of a compound of formula (II) or a 
mixture of both isomers, in an inert organic solvent, in the presence of a 
polymeric base (as hereinafter defined) and light. By "inert organic solvent" is meant an organic solvent which does not 
react chemically to any significant extent with bromine under the 
conditions of the process. Suitable solvents include halogenated, for 
example chlorinated, aliphatic and aromatic organic solvents having a 
boiling point not less than 20°C, for instance carbon tetrachloride and 
chlorobenzene. By the term "polymeric base" is meant an organic polymer comprising 
repeat units containing a basic group which will form a salt with an 
inorganic acid, in this case hydrogen bromide, without generating water. 
For example, the basic group may be an amino group, such as a tertiary 
amino group. Typically the polymeric base will comprise repeat units 
containing a tertiary nitrogen atom which is a member of a heterocyclic 
ring. The heterocyclic ring may be aromatic, for example a pyridine ring, 
or non-aromatic, for example, a pyrrolidine ring. Suitable polymeric bases 
include cross-linked poly(vinylpyridine) polymers, cross-linked copolymers 
of styrene and vinylpyridine, for instance 4-vinylpyridine, and 
poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) polymers. Commercially available examples include 
poly(4-vinylpyridine) 2% cross-linked with divinylbenzene, 
poly(2-vinylpyridine-co-styrene) having a styrene content of 30%; poly(4--vinylpyridine-co-styrene)  
 
having a styrene content of 10%; polyvinylpyrrolidone, 
cross-linked (PVPDC) mp >300°C; and polyvinylpyrrolidone 
(povidone, PVP) of varying average molecular weights of 10,000,
