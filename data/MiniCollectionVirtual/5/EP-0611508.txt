<ABSTRACT>
In a method according to the invention, a transmitting party sends a transfer request to a transfer network. Upon receiving the request the transfer network allocates a service number (SN) to the transmitting party if allowed by the current traffic load. The service number identifies the transmitting party for a predetermined period. On sending the service number to the communicating party which originated the transfer request, the transfer network preferably starts a timer which monitors the validity period of the service number. The transmitting party sends the destination address (DN) over the transfer network only once during the validity period of the service number. The transfer network associates the destination address (DN) to the service number allocated to the transmitting party. The transmitting party utilizes only the service number (SN) as an identity in the data packets transferred during the actual data transfer, and the transfer network routes the packet to the destination address associated with the service number.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for the transfer
of packet data from a transmitting party over a
transfer network to a receiving party on the basis of
the destination address.In the transfer of packet data, the data packet
usually contains not only the user data to be transferred
but also overhead data, such as the identification
(address) of the receiving party, on the basis of
which the transfer network is able to route the data
packet to its destination. However, standard addresses
used in data communication systems (telephone numbers,
subscriber identities, equipment identities, etc.) are
relatively long so that they require packet transfer
capacity which otherwise could be utilized for the
transfer of user data. This problem is further aggravated
when very short data packets have to be used e.g.
due to the characteristics of the transmission
channel. In such very short data packets, standard
addresses would use almost all of the packet transfer
capacity. In the worst case, the transfer capacity of
the data packet is not sufficient to accommodate the
address. However, as mentioned above, each data packet
in a normal packet data transfer should contain
address data in order that the system could identify
and route the packets, especially in cases where there
are several subscribers transmitting packet data simultaneously
on the same channel. EP-A-0332818 discloses a packet-switched cellular
system comprising a cellular switch and base sites for
providing packet-switched data services to cellular
mobile stations. Base sites are coupled to the cellular
switch by T1 span lines which are coupled to the
landline telephone network. All the slots in the span
lines are clear channels containing no trunk signalling
information, one time slot in each direction being
dedicated for common channel signalling. Multiple data
calls are assigned to each packet-mode radio channel to
conserve the radio channel spectrum.EP-A-0522636 discloses a TDMA communication system
in which data packets are transmitted with lengths
essentially corresponding to the lengths of the time
slots of the common communication channel so that more
information can be transmitted per data packet.The object of the invention is a packet data 
transfer method which alleviates the above problem and
utilizes the available transfer capacity more efficiently
than the prior art methods.One concept of the invention is a method for the
transfer of packet data from a transmitting party over
a transfer network to a receiving party. The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Method for the transfer of packet data from a
transmitting party over a transfer network to a

receiving party on the basis of the destination address
of the receiving party, characterised in that


the transmitting party sends the destination
address (DN) to the transfer network only once for each

transfer transaction;
the transfer network allocates the transmitting
party a service number (SN) at the beginning of the

transfer transaction so as to identify the transmitting
party and the destination address (DN), the service

number being shorter than the destination address;
the transmitting party utilizes the allocated
service number (SN) in place of the destination address

(DN) in the data packets sent during the transfer
transaction; and
the transfer network identifies the data packets
sent by the transmitting party on the basis of the

service number (SN) and forwards the data packets on the
basis of the destination address (DN) associated with

said service number (SN).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the service number (SN) allocated to the transmitting

party is valid for a predetermined period, the expiry of
said period freeing the service number for reallocation.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that
the transmitting party monitors the lapse of said

predetermined validity period of the service number
(SN), and the transmitting party continues the transfer

of packet data after the expiry of the validity period
of the service number by sending a new packet data 

transfer request to the transfer network, and the
transfer network allocates a new service number (SN) to

the transmitting party if allowed by the traffic load of
the transfer network.
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 3 for the
transfer of user data in packet format in a cellular

radio system comprising at least one base station (BTS)
in each cell, the base station communicating with mobile

stations (MS) residing in the cell and comprising at
least one common control channel (CCCH) shared by all of

the mobile stations for sending connection establishment
requests and response messages thereto from the base

station (BTS) to the mobile stations (MS) and from the

mobile stations to the base station for establishing an
actual connection on another channel, characterised in

that the transmitting party is a mobile station and the
transfer network is a fixed network in the cellular

radio system, and that the user data in packet format is
transferred between the base station (BTS) of the fixed

network and the mobile radio stations (MS)in modified
