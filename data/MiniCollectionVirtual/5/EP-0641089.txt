<ABSTRACT>
A portable radio communication apparatus has a main 
unit and a detachable and chargeable battery pack. The 

main unit has a power amplifier (power module) for sending 
out high frequency power to a whip antenna for transmitting/receiving 

use and a transmit/receive signal processing 
section for signal processing in transmission and reception. 

The battery pack further has a nickel hydride battery of 
a layered structure, which is low in internal resistance 

and outputs a high voltage, for supplying power to the 
transmission power amplifier which consumes a large 

current, and a low-voltage lithium ion battery, which 
is high in internal resistance, for supplying power to 

the transmit/receive signal processing section which 
consumes a relatively small current. This configuration 

makes unnecessary the otherwise required stabilizing 
circuit for supplying a low voltage to the transmit/receive 

signal processing section. At the same time, 
the voltage fluctuations of the nickel metal hydride 

battery when the power amplifier begins transmission or 
at any other time would not affect the voltage from the 

lithium ion battery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable radio
apparatus, and more particularly to a portable radio
communication apparatus for supplying a plurality of
circuits including a large current consuming circuit
with optimal power for the operation of each from a
plurality of types of batteries.A conventional radio apparatus has a main unit and
a pack of chargeable batteries, which serves as power
source for the main unit. The main unit has a power
amplifier for supplying high frequency power to a whip
antenna and a transmit/receive signal processing section
for processing transmit signals and receive signals. The
battery pack has built-in nickel cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries
or nickel metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries.The main unit and the battery pack have a detaching
mechanism, which allows them to be detached when the
batteries are to be charged and to be put together again
when the charging is completed. The main unit and the
battery pack respectively have power input terminals and
power output terminals, which come into contact with each
other when the two units are joined. In such a portable
radio apparatus, when the operating voltage is to be 
supplied to the power amplifier and the transmit/receive
signal processing section of the main unit, the circuit
operation may be adversely affected by any voltage
fluctuation. For instance, if the voltage of the Ni-Cd
batteries has fallen to a certain prescribed low level,
the transmit/receive signal processing section will
still operate normally, but the power amplifier may not,
failing to supply the required transmitting power. Or,
when the power amplifier does operate, i.e. at the time
of transmission, if a large current will flow to invite
a substantial voltage drop, the transmit/receive signal
processing section may be prevented from normal operation.
For this reason, batteries of a relatively high-voltage,
which is needed to obtain transmitting power efficiently,
are used, and at the same time there is provided a
stabilizing circuit for converting this high voltage to
a low voltage required for the operation of the transmit/
receive signal processing section. Furthermore, where
the circuitry of the apparatus is complex, a large number
of stabilizing circuits are needed to supply a stabilized
voltage to each processing circuit.Another known such apparatus according to the prior
art is described in JP-A-62-232 222.
Said apparatus
is provided with a control unit for the transmission
output for detecting the source voltage that is supplied 
and sending out the
