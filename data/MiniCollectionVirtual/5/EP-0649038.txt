<ABSTRACT>
A cladding layer (2) covers a part of a substrate (1) and 
two core layers (8,9) are formed in the cladding layer. The 

two core layers merge with each other and a head (3c) of a 
common part of the two core layers appears on a side wall of 

the cladding layer. A guide portion a groove, or a pair of protrusious 
(4a,4b), or a recess is located near the side 

wall. A reflective element (5) having an end face coated with a 
reflective film (6a) is positioned by the guide portion so 

that the head of a common part of the two core layers 
adheres to the reflective film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical path converter, and more
particularly relates to a waveguide-type optical path converter for converting
a propagation direction of light using an end face reflection technique.Optical communication systems and optical signal switching
systems typically include an optical modulator, optical switch and optical
multiplexer/separator, etc., which are optical waveguide-type devices.
Recently, research on optical wiring and the like on an optical waveguide
substrate has been carried out and techniques for efficient arrangement with
little loss of optical waveguide-type devices are of increasing importance.
Among them, an optical path converting technique for converting a
propagation direction of light is important to miniaturize apparatus which use
optical devices.As an optical path conversion technique, an end face reflection
technique is well known in the art. For example, this technique is disclosed
in S. Valette, "State of the art of integrated technology at LETI for
achieving passive optical components', Journal of Modern Optics. 1988,
Vol. 35, No. 6, pp. 993-1005.The end face reflection technique has a feature that optical path
conversion efficiency is high and it has a wide range of optical path 
conversion. In this technique, an end face of a substrate and a waveguide
is ground so that an angle between a waveguide face and the end face being
ground becomes 90 degrees and so that a head of the waveguide appears on
a face being ground. Next, the ground face is coated with a reflective film.Referring to Fig. 1, a conventional waveguide-type optical path
converter will be described. Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of the
conventional converter.In Fig. 1, a silicon (Si) crystal substrate 1 is covered with a
cladding layer 2, in which first and second core layers 8 and 9 are formed.
The cladding layer 2 and the first and second core layers constitute two
optical waveguides. The first and second core layers 8 and 9 merge with
each other near one side of the cladding layer 2.An end face of a common core layer 3c is exposed by cutting
the common core layer at a plane normal to the waveguides. The exposed
face is ground and is covered with a reflective film 6.In addition, the other ends 3a and 3b of the first and the second
core layers appear on the opposite side of the cladding layer 2.Since the cladding layer 2 has a lower refractive index than that
of the core layers 8 and 9, light propagates mainly through the core layers.When light is inputted through the end surface 3a
