<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel β-lactams.
The β-lactams of the present invention
find utility as intermediates in the preparation of
sidechain-bearing taxanes such as taxol and taxol
derivatives. The present invention also relates to
novel methods of coupling β-lactams to form such
sidechain-bearing taxanes, and to novel sidechain-bearing
taxanes.Taxanes are diterpene compounds having
utility in the pharmaceutical field. For example,
taxol, a taxane having the structure:

where Ph is phenyl, Ac is acetyl and Bz is benzoyl,
has been found to be an effective anticancer agent.Naturally occurring taxanes such as taxol
may be found in plant materials, and have been 
isolated therefrom. Such taxanes may, however, be present in plant materials in
relatively small amounts so that, in the case of taxol, for example, large numbers of the
slow-growing yew trees forming a source for the compound may be required. The art
has thus continued to search for synthetic, including semi-synthetic routes for the
preparation of naturally occurring taxanes such as taxol, as well as routes for the
preparation of synthetic, pharmaceutically useful analogs thereof.EP 0400971 (Florida State University) discloses a series of β-lactams, a
process for their preparation, and a process for the preparation of taxol involving the
use of such β-lactams.WO 93/06079 (Florida State University) discloses a process for preparing N-acyl,
N-sulphonyl and N-phosphoryl substituted isoserine esters in which a metal
alkoxide is reacted with a β-lactam. Similarly, WO 93/06094 (Florida State
University) relates to metalic alkoxides useful in the preparation of taxol.WO 90/10443 (University of Kansas) discloses derivatives of taxol which have
improved water solubility compared to taxol per se and which still exhibit good
antitumour activity.EP 0537905 (Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties, Inc.) discloses water
soluble taxol derivatives with antineoplastic activity. Such derivatives include 2'-acryloyltaxol
and sulphonated 2'-0-acyl taxol derivatives.EP 0495718 (Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer SA) relates to β-phenylisoserine -(2R,3S)
compounds and salts thereof, together with methods of preparation thereof and their
use in the synthesis of taxane derivatives.EP 0569281 (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company) relates to 2'-N-substituted-aminomethyl
benzoate or 2'-N-substituted-amino-benzoate taxol derivatives optionally
substituted with a (phosphonooxyphenyl) alkanoyloxy, (phosphonooxy) alkanoyloxy
or [(phosphonooxyalkyl)-phenyl] alkanoyloxy group at the C-7
