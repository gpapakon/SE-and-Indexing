an electrophotographic process comprising forming a 

peelable transfer layer mainly containing a resin (A) 
capable of being removed upon a chemical reaction 

treatment on the surface of an electrophotographic 
light-sensitive element, forming a toner image on the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
preparation of a printing plate by an electrophotographic
process,
and more particularly to a method for preparation of a
printing plate by an electrophotographic process
comprising transfer of a toner image formed by an
electrophotographic process together with a transfer
layer and removal of the transfer layer wherein the
transfer layer is easily transferred and removed and
good image qualities are maintained during a plate-making
process thereby providing prints of good image
qualities.Lithographic offset printing plates currently
employed include PS plates which are produced by using a
positively working photosensitive composition mainly
comprising a diazo compound and a phenolic resin or a
negatively working photosensitive composition mainly
comprising an acrylic monomer or a prepolymer thereof.
Since all of these conventional PS plates have low
sensitivity, it is necessary to conduct contact exposure 
from a film on which an image has already been recorded
for plate-making.On the other hand, owing to the recent technical
advancements of image processing by a computer, storage
of a large amount of data and data communication, input
of information, revision, edition, layout, and pagination
are consistently computerized, and electronic
editorial system enabling instantaneous output on a
remote terminal plotter through a high speed communication
network or a communications satellite has been
practically used. The need of the electronic editorial
system has been increasing especially in the field of
printing newspaper requiring immediacy. Also in the
field where an original is preserved as a film from
which a printing plate may be reproduced in case of
necessity, it is expected that digitalized data will be
stored in very large volume recording media such as
optical discs.However, few direct type printing plate precursors
directly preparing printing plates based on the
output from a terminal plotter have been put to
practical use. For the time being, even in the field
where an electronic editorial system actually works, the
output is once visualized on a silver halide photographic
film, which is then subjected to contact 
exposure to a PS plate to produce a printing plate. One
reason for this is difficulty in developing a direct
type printing plate precursor having high sensitivity to
a light source of the plotter, e.g., an He-Ne laser or a
semiconductor laser, sufficient for enabling plate-making
within a practically allowable period of
