<ABSTRACT>
An automatic blood pressure monitor (10) having a blood pressure 
cuff (12), an air pump (16) applying pressurized air to the cuff (12), an 

air valve (18) selectively 
venting the cuff (12), and a pressure transducer (20) generating an 

output signal 
having a D.C. component indicative of the steady-state pressure in the 

cuff, 
and an A.C. component indicative of oscillometric pulses. The pressure 

transducer (20) output is amplified and applied to an analog-to-digital 
converter (24) 

which generates a digital word indicative of the steady-state cuff 
pressure. 

The amplified pressure transducer output is also applied to one input 
of a 

differential amplifier (26) having an output that is applied to an 
analog-to-digital 

converter (24) having a limited operating range. The other input of the 
amplifier 

receives an offset signal from a voltage source (32) to offset the 
amplified 

pressure transducer output so that the output of the differential 
amplifier will 

not exceed the operating range of the analog-to-digital converter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automatic blood pressure monitors, 
and more particularly, to an automatic blood pressure monitor that 
minimizes the loss of oscillometric data caused by changes in the cuff 
pressure. Automatic blood pressure monitors are commonly used to 
periodically measure the blood pressure of a patient. In most automatic 
blood pressure monitors, a pressure cuff is attached to a patient's arm over 
the brachial artery. The cuff is first pressurized with an applied pressure 
that is high enough to substantially occlude the brachial artery. The cuff 
pressure is then gradually reduced, either continuously or in increments. As 
the pressure is reduced to systolic pressure, the flow of blood through the 
brachial artery beneath the cuff increases substantially. When the blood flows through the brachial artery following 
each contraction of the heart, it imparts a pulsatile movement to the wall of 
the artery. This pulsatile movement is coupled to a blood pressure cuff 
extending over the artery as minute changes in the cuff pressure, which are 
known as oscillometric pulses. Automatic blood pressure monitors 
employing the oscillometric method measure and record the amplitude of 
the oscillometric pulses at a number of cuff pressures. After the blood 
pressure measurement had been completed, a table contains the 
oscillometric pulse amplitudes recorded at each cuff pressure. In theory, the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood 
pressures can then be determined from the values in the table using 
theoretical and/or empirical definitions of these parameters as a function of 
the amplitudes of these oscillometric pulses. However, blood pressure 
measurements are often adversely affected by artifact, generally produced 
by patient movement. Motion-induced artifact can substantially alter the  
 
measured amplitude of oscillometric pulses, thus introducing inaccuracies in 
the measurement of the patient's blood pressure. Another problem associated with automatic blood pressure 
monitors using the oscillometric method occurs when the cuff pressure is 
changed from one pressure to another, particularly if the pressure is 
incrementally changed at a relatively high rate. The cuff pressure consists of 
two components, a relatively constant, or "DC", component and a relatively 
variable, or "AC", component. The relatively constant component defines 
the occlusive force of the blood pressure cuff, while the relatively variable 
component is produced by the oscillometric pressure pulses
