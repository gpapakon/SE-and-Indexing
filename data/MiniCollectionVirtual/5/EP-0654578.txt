<ABSTRACT>
Fire-protection structural element with a prestressed glass pane with a peripheral insertion border. The insertion border of the glass pane has on both sides, on the glass-pane side, a heat-conducting coating, said coating being designed in order to conduct large heat currents, which are absorbed in the event of a fire, into the insertion border.

<CLAIMS>
A fire-protection module comprising a glass pane (1)
and an all-round holding rim (2), in which the holding

rim (2) contains a heat-conducting coating (5) on both
surfaces and in which the coating is designed to conduct

high heat flows absorbed in case of a fire into
the holding rim, 
characterised
 in that the holding
rim containing the coating (5) is connected to a support

frame (3) by glass retaining strips (4), forming a
receiving groove for the holding rim (2) as well as a

sectional heat transfer strip (6) which, viewed in
cross section, contains a holding rim flange (7), a

covering section (8) and a radiation flange (9) and in
which, in case of a fire, the sectional heat transfer

strip (6) takes up thermal energy on the fire side and
gives off the transferred thermal energy on the opposing

side into the surroundings via the holding rim (2)
of the glass pane (1).
A fire-protection module according to claim 1, in which
the holding rim flange (7) is arranged between the

coating (5) of the holding rim (2) and the associated
glass retaining strip (4) and against the holding rim

(2) and in which the covering section (8) covers the
assigned glass retaining strip (4) and the radiation

flange (9) is positioned on the outside and in front of
this glass retaining strip (4).
A fire-protection module according to claim 1 or 2, in
which a heat insulating material (10) is arranged 

between the sectional heat transfer strip (6) and the
glass retaining strips (4).
A fire-protection module according to one of the claims
1 to 3, in which the retaining frame is made of metal

and the sectional heat transfer strips (6) and the

coating (5) of the holding rim (2) are designed in
such a way, that the fire-protection module offers a

fire resistance period in excess of 60 minutes during a
fire test according to DIN 4102 and preferably in

excess of 90 minutes.
A fire-protection module according to one of the claims
1 to 4, in which the sectional heat transfer strips (6)

are made from a good heat-conducting metal alloy, whose
melting point lies below that of the glass pane.
A fire-protection module according to one of the claims
1 to 5, in which at least the covering sections (8)

and radiation flanges (9) of the sectional heat transfer
strips (6) contain a coat of high IR-absorbing and

IR-emitting paint.
A fire-protection module according to one of the claims
1 to 6, in which the sectional heat transfer strips (6)

and the coating (5) of the holding rim (2) are designed
in such a way that at least some areas of the sectional

heat transfer strip (6) on the fire side melt during
the specified fire protection period.
A fire-protection module comprising a glass pane (1)
and a surrounding holding rim (2), in which the holding 

rim (2) contains a heat-conducting coating (5) on both
surfaces and in which the coating is designed to conduct

high heat flows absorbed in case of a fire into
the holding rim, characterised in that the holding

rim containing the coating (5) is connected to a support
frame (3) via glass retaining strips (4) forming a

receiving groove for the holding rim (2) and in which
the coating (5) comprises a heat-conducting module (5)

and a receiving groove (11), in which the said receiving
groove (11) accepts the holding rim (2) and the

glass pane (1) and in which the side legs of the
receiving groove (11) are in thermal contact with both

main sides of the glass pane (1).
A fire-protection module according to claim 8, in which
the receiving groove (11) contains at least one side

leg, whose length corresponds to the thickness of the
glass pane or exceeds the thickness of the glass pane.
A fire-protection module according to claim 8 or 9, in
which at least one side leg of the receiving groove

(11) cantilevers over the glass support strips (4).
A fire-protection module according to claim 10, in
which the side leg cantilevers by at least 10 mm.
A fire-protection module according to claim 10 or 11,
in which the cantilevering side leg is covered by a

decorative cover (14). 
A fire-protection module according to one of the claims
8 to 12, in which the receiving groove (11) has a U-shaped

cross section.

thick and the heat-conducting module (5) contains a web
(19) that can be inserted into the receiving channel

for glazing, in which the pane (1) is retained outside
of the receiving channel by the side legs of the

receiving groove (11) of the heat-conducting module
(5).
