<ABSTRACT>
A television set provided with internal devices (1, 3, 5) for generating a delayed source signal in order to affect the magnitude (X) of the delay and enable a portion of the programme being watched to be replaced or skipped. The invention relates particularly to colour television and television sets incorporating video signal compression and decompression devices.

<CLAIMS>
Television receiver comprising:

means for obtaining a source signal,
display means for viewing images representative of
said source signal,
internal means making it possible to defer the
application of the said source signal to the said

display means, the said deferment being obtained
by writing and reading the images of the said

source signal to and from a buffer memory of
sufficient capacity to contain a plurality of the

said images, and
means for causing the said deferment to undergo an
abrupt change of its value on request, followed by

automatic and progressive resumption of its
initial value so as to satisfy a subsequent

request.
Receiver according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said internal means comprise: a writeable and

erasable information medium, means for causing the said
medium to pay out past a recording head and past a

reading head and means for displacing the said reading
head, so as to modify its position within that region

of the said medium which is scanned by the said
recording h
ead.
Receiver according to Claim 2, characterized in
that means are provided for digitizing the said source

signal prior to writing it to the said medium. 
Receiver according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that the said head and the said medium

form a write/read system of magneto-optical type.
Receiver according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the said buffer memory is

a random access memory managed by microprocessor.
Receiver according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the said buffer memory is

a semiconductor memory.
Receiver according to Claim 5 or 6,
characterized in that the said memory can be extended

by adding modules.
Process for a deferred transmission of a
sequence of moving images in a television receiver via

a buffer memory associated with means for write- and
read-addressing, the said buffer memory having a

sufficient capacity to contain a plurality of images of
the said sequence; on request by choice, it abruptly

increases the value of the deferment in such a way as
to repeat the reading of a portion of the said

sequence, and then it automatically and progressively
decreases the value of the deferment so as to return to

its initial value; or else, it abruptly decreases the
value of the deferment in such a way as to skip a

portion of the said sequence by accelerated reading or
by instantaneous jump in reading, and then it

automatically and progressively increases the value of
the deferment, by duplicating the reading of an image

undergoing reading after a predetermined number of
images read, doing so repetitively, so as to return to

its initial value so as to satisfy a subsequent
request.
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the signals representative of the said images are

subjected to a compression processing prior to their
writing to the said buffer memory and in that the

signals resulting from the reading of the said buffer
memory undergo an inverse processing before being

applied to display means. 
Process according to Claim 8 or 9,
characterized in that the write-addressing of the said

memory is incremented image by image as is the read-addressing;
the disparity between the write- and read-addressing

being modified by several units so as to
change the value of the said deferment in one direction

and then in the inverse direction, unit by unit, at a
rate which is a submultiple of the rate of reading of

the said images, so as to return to the initial
disparity.
Process according to any one of Claims 8 to 10,
characterized in-that the nondeferred source signal is

used in a phase of normal operation, whilst means are
provided for substituting it with the deferred source

signal in a transient phase ending in the resumption of
the said normal operation.
