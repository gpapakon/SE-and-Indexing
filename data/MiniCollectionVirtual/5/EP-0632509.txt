<ABSTRACT>
A linear optocoupler (71) having a light emitting diode 
(28) and a detector diode (29) formed on a common 

semiconductor substrate (33). Light emitted by the light 
emitting diode (28) is transmissive to semiconductor substrate 

(33). A layer of light reflective material (34) is formed on a 
side opposite from which the light emitting diode (28) and the 

detector diode (29) on the semiconductor substrate (33). A 
portion of light emitted by the light emitting diode (28) 

transmits through the semiconductor substrate (33) to be 
reflected by the layer of light reflective material (34). The 

reflected light transmits through the semiconductor substrate 
(33) to be received by the detector diode (29). A photo detector 

diode (61) and the semiconductor substrate (33) including the 
light emitting diode (28) and the detector diode (29) are 

mounted on a lead frame (51) co-planar to one another. A light 
flux coupling media (76) couples light from the light emitting 

diode (28) to the photo detector diode (29).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general to optocouplers, and more 
particularly to an integrated circuit combining a light emitting diode and a 
detector diode on a common substrate for a linear optocoupler. Standard transistor optocoupler circuits are generally built and 
assembled from discrete components. For example, a common linear 
optocoupler comprises a light emitting diode (LED), a detector diode (or 
servo detector diode), and a photo detector diode. Typically, the light 
emitting diode and the servo detector diode are gallium arsenide diodes. The 
photo detector diode is normally a silicon photo diode. Each component is a 
discrete device that is mounted and aligned within a complex package such 
that the detector diode and photo detector diode each receives light emitted 
from the light emitting diode. The components are placed in close proximity 
to one another to maximize light transmission and reception (within the 
constraints of the package) Silicone gel is sometimes used as a light flux 
coupling media between the light emitting diode and the servo and photo 
detector diodes. There are several problems that can be traced to the use of discrete 
components. First, a fairly complex package must be designed to hold each 
component in a very exacting relationship to one another. For example, a 
non-planar lead frame package having two opposed surfaces is well known in 
the optocoupler art. A light emitting diode and a servo detector diode are 
placed on one surface. A photo detector diode is placed on the other surface 
across from the LED. The photo detector diode is aligned to maximize light 
reception from the LED. This type of packaging is difficult to manufacture 
and expensive. Second, alignment is critical. For example, the LED flux coupling 
factor between the LED and the detector diode depends on the placement 
accuracy of the detector diode with respect to the LED. This problem can be 
reduced by the use of light flux coupling media as described above. Third, using discrete components decreases linearity of a linear 
optocoupler due to manufacturing tolerances. Also, temperature and aging 
affects are magnified due to the different manufacture of each component. Finally, using individual components requires more part testing, more 
handling, and increased potential for yield losses or field failures. It would  
 
be of great benefit if a linear optocoupler could be formed which increases 
linearity, simplifies manufacture, and reduces cost. European Patent Application no.
