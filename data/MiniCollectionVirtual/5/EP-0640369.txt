<ABSTRACT>
A liquid filter (10) for fuel is proposed in which a star insert (22) through which flow passes radially is installed in the interior of a housing (11) using a sleeve-type shaped seal ring (31). The seal ring (31) is pushed onto a tube stub (17) projecting into the interior (18) of the housing (11) and enables radial sealing in a small diameter. The shaped seal ring (31) fixed in the filter insert (22) has a resilient annular bead (37) by which it rests against radially running ridges (91) fixed in the housing and which enables an axial compensation of manufacturing tolerances with minimal counterforce for the star insert (22) fixed in the housing (11).

Liquid filter, especially for fuels, with a 
housing which accommodates a radial-flow star-shaped 

insert and comprises a cap-shaped housing part and a 
cover which is connected nonreleasably to the latter, 

these components each having, for the formation of a line 
filter, connections situated at the end and centrally in 

the housing, and in which the two end edges of the star-shaped 
insert are secured leaktightly in two end caps, a 

first end cap of which closes a centrally situated 
opening leading to the interior of the filter insert 

while the second end cap has an aperture associated with 
the interior, and a radially acting sealing element which 

separates the dirty side from the clean side rests 
against the said end cap, and in which the star-shaped 

insert is supported axially in the housing by means of 
its first end cap, characterized in that the sealing 

element is constructed as an essentially sleeve-shaped 
preshaped sealing ring (31) of flexible material which is 

arranged leaktightly and firmly in the aperture (29) in 
the second end cap (26), in that a tubular stub (17, 53) 

which projects into the interior of the housing (11, 41) 
and on which the radially sealing preshaped sealing ring 

(31) is secured is formed on a connection (16), so that 
the connection (16) is connected to the inner chamber 

(24) of the filter insert (22), and in that means (37) 
which compensate for axial tolerances are arranged on the 

preshaped sealing ring (31), these means having an 
annular bead (37) which is arranged on the end of the 

preshaped sealing ring (31) and is supported by way of  
 

radially extending webs (19, 52) against the inner wall 
of the housing (11, 42), in particular the cover (13, 

43). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that rubber is used as the flexible material for the 

preshaped sealing ring (31). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a relatively soft plastic, especially Viton, is 

used as the flexible material for the preshaped sealing 
ring (31). 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the preshaped sealing ring (31) has 

a section (32, 34) with an external annular groove (33), 
by means of which it is fitted in the second end cap 

(26), in the circular rim of the aperture (29). 
Liquid filter according to one or more of Claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that the housing (11) is composed 

of plastic and its cup-shaped housing part (12) has 
pedestals (27) which lie close to the bottom (14), which 

serve to provide axial support for the star-shaped insert 
(22) and on which ribs (28) serving for the radial 

clamping of the end cap (25) are arranged. 
Liquid filter according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the webs (19) extending on the inside of the 

cover (13) extend essentially over the entire diameter of 
the latter. 
Liquid filter according to one or more of Claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that the housing (41) is composed 

of metal, and the cover (43) accommodates a plug 
(47) in a manner secured against rotation in a depression 

(46), the tubular stub (53) which projects into the 
interior (18) of the housing (41) and the radial webs 

(52) being formed on this plug. 
Liquid filter according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the cover (43) has a depression (46) of hexagonal 

cross-section and the plug (47) is composed of plastic 
with an embedded nut (49), and the external hexagon (48) 

of the plug (47) is matched to the depression (46). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized  
 

in that radial guide bosses (45) which centre and 
provide axial support for the filter insert (22) in the 

housing (41) are arranged on the outside of the first end 
cap (25).
