<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic ejector comprises a rigid support 
member 18 having a base portion 20 and an upstanding boss 

21 integral with the base portion, and an elastomeric 
ejection element 19 having a diaphragm portion 27 and a 

skirt portion 28 surrounding the diaphragm portion and 
secured to the boss. The support member 18 has an air 

inlet passage 22 for supplying air under pressure to move 
the diaphragm away from the boss. The upper end of the 

upstanding boss may be concave and the diaphragm may be of 
complementary shape. The diaphragm may have an integral 

protrusion 29 upstanding from a central region of the 
diaphragm. Additionally or alternatively, the diaphragm 

may have an integral protrusion 30 which depends from a 
central region of the diaphragm and which extends into a 

through bore 23 in the upstanding boss, the through bore 
communicating with the air inlet passage in the support 

member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pneumatic ejector and 
more particularly to such an ejector for ejecting cut sheet 
from between the cutting blades of a die-cutting press, and 
to a die-cutting press equipped with such ejectors. Known pneumatic ejectors comprise a plastics base 
and an elastomeric bellows device attached to the base by 
trapping the lowermost part of the bellows device between 
a plastics disc and the plastics base. The disc has an 
internally threaded hub which threadably engages an 
externally threaded boss on the base and the boss has a 
through bore which communicates with an air inlet passage 
in the base. The bellows device contracts as the board is 
cut in the die cutting press and is expanded by pressurised 
air supplied by way of the air inlet passage in the base to 
eject the cut sheet from between the cutting blades of the 
press. The present invention seeks to provide a 
pneumatic ejector in an improved form. According to a first aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a pneumatic ejector comprising 
a rigid support member having a base portion and an 
upstanding boss integral with the base portion, and an 
elastomeric ejection element having a diaphragm portion and  
 
a skirt portion surrounding the diaphragm portion and 
secured to the boss, the support member having an air inlet 
passage for supplying air under pressure to move the 
diaphragm away from the boss. Preferably, the skirt portion is moulded onto the 
upstanding boss. Additionally or alternatively, the skirt 
portion is bonded to the upstanding boss by adhesive. Preferably, the upstanding boss has an annular, 
circumferential groove receiving a part of the skirt 
portion of the ejection element. Preferably, the upper end of the upstanding boss 
is concave and the diaphragm is of complementary shape. Preferably, the diaphragm has an integral 
protrusion upstanding from a central region of the 
diaphragm. Advantageously, the diaphragm has an integral 
protrusion which depends from a central region of the 
diaphragm and which extends into a through bore in the 
upstanding boss, said through bore communicating with the 
air inlet passage in the support member. According to a second aspect of the invention 
there is provided a die-cutting press comprising a movable  
 
bed supporting a die for cutting a sheet, a pressing roller 
for applying pressure to the combination of the die and the 
sheet supported on the bed to form the required cuts in the 
sheet, a drive unit for rotating the pressing roller and 
for

<CLAIMS>
A pneumatic ejector comprising a rigid support 
member (18) having a base portion (20) and an upstanding 

boss (21) integral with the base portion, and an 
elastomeric ejection element (19) having a diaphragm 

portion (27) and a skirt portion (28) surrounding the 
diaphragm portion and secured to the boss, the support 

member having an air inlet passage (22) for supplying air 
under pressure to move the diaphragm away from the boss. 
A pneumatic ejector as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the skirt portion (28) is moulded onto the 

upstanding boss (21). 
A pneumatic ejector as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2, wherein the skirt portion (28) is bonded to the 

upstanding boss (21) by adhesive. 
A pneumatic ejector as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the upstanding boss (21') has an annular flange 

(35) with a plurality of apertures (36) therein and the 
skirt portion (28') is moulded around the flange and has 

parts extending through the apertures in the flange. 
A pneumatic ejector as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the upper end of the upstanding 

boss (21) is concave and the diaphragm portion (27) is of 
complementary shape. 
A pneumatic ejector as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the diaphragm portion (27) has an 

integral protrusion (29) upstanding from a central region 
thereof. 
A pneumatic ejector as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein the diaphragm portion (27) has an 

integral protrusion (30) which depends from a central 
region of the diaphragm portion and which extends into a 

through bore (23) in the upstanding boss, said through bore 
communicating with the air inlet passage (22) in the 

support member. 
A die-cutting press comprising a movable bed (7) 
supporting a die (15) for cutting a sheet (14), a pressing 

roller (5) for applying pressure to the combination of the 
die and the sheet supported on the bed to form the required 

cuts in the sheet, a drive unit for rotating the pressing 
roller and for moving the bed relative to the pressing 

roller so that the combination of the die and the sheet is 
roll pressed between the pressing roller and the bed, a 

support roller (6) for supporting the bed during movement 
of the bed relative to the pressing roller, and one or more 

pneumatic ejectors (18, 19) as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims for ejecting cut sheet from between 

cutting blades (16) of the die.
