<ABSTRACT>
The guide bolts (15) at the ends of the slats (7) exhibit a sliding part (19) which is connected to said slats such that it can be displaced parallel to the longitudinal edges (29) of the slats (7). In this manner, the slats (7) can be individually connected to the vertical guides (5) or released therefrom. In order to mount the screen, the latter no longer has to be inserted in its entirety into the vertical guides from above or from beneath.

A venetian blind with multiple slats at whose 
extremities guide pins with an attachment part and a 

T-shaped guide part are attached and which, for 
lateral guidance, are guided in vertical guides with 

slot-shaped guide grooves facing the extremities of 
the slats, characterised in that the guide parts 

(19, 119, 219) are designed in such a way that from 
a mounting position in which they do not project - 

or only slightly project - beyond the extremities of 
the slat, they are movable into a functional 

position in which they project beyond the 
extremities of the slat into the vertical guides (5, 

105, 205). 
A venetian blind according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the guide parts (19, 119) are arranged on 

the slats (7, 107) in such a way that they are 
movable parallel to the latter's longitudinal edges 

(29, 129). 
A venetian blind according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the guide bolts (15, 115) are movably 

retained in a guide groove (31, 131). 
A venetian blind according to claim 3, characterised 
in that the guide groove (131) is developed as an 

incision at the extremity of the slat (107). 
A venetian blind according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the guide parts (219) are swivellably 

attached to the slats (207).  
 
Venetian blinds according to one of claims 4 or 5, 
characterised in that attached to the slat (7, 107, 

207) is a catch arrangement in the shape of an 

indentation (37) or a drill hole (137, 237), which a 
cam (35, 135, 235) at the attachment part (17) or 

the guide pin (115, 215) respectively is intended to 
engage. 
A venetian blind according to one of claims 4 to 6, 
characterised in that the attachment part (117) 

comprises a guide tongue (149) intended to engage 
the guide groove (131). 
A venetian blind according to claim 3, characterised 
in that the guide groove (31) is arranged at the 

attachment part (17) which is attached to the slat 
(7). 
A venetian blind according to claim 8, characterised 
in that the guide groove (31) is designed as a 

dovetailed or T-shaped groove. 
A venetian blind according to one of claims 8 or 9, 
characterised in that the guide part (19) is movably 

and lockably held in the attachment part (17).
