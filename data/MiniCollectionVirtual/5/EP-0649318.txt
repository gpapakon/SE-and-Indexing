<ABSTRACT>
The syringe for medicinal purposes consists of a syringe barrel (1), one end of which is formed as an adapter (2) for a cannula or a closure (3), e.g., in the form of a tip cap, and of a plunger (4), arranged within the syringe barrel (1), and movable by a piston rod (5). At the end of the syringe barrel (1) facing away from the adapter (2), a plunger brake (6) is arranged, which is formed by a rest piece surrounding the syringe barrel (1) and connected removably to it. The rest piece has a projection extending into the lumen of the syringe barrel (1), which forms a stop for the side of the plunger (4) away from the adapter (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a syringe for medicinal purposes,
with a syringe barrel, one end of which is designed
as an adapter for a cannula or a closure piece,
e.g., in the form of a tip cap, and with a plunger arranged
in the syringe barrel and movable via a piston
rod.Syringes of this type are increasingly being marketed,
especially as ready-to-use syringes in prefilled form,
for self-administration by the patient, as has long
been the case, especially for regular administration of
insulin in diabetics.In the case of unskilled or infirm people, there is a
risk that before application the plunger will accidentally
be pulled out of the syringe barrel so that, as a
rule, the product is no longer usable. US-A-4 711 637 discloses a syringe having a barrel with
an outwardly extending barrel projection at the proximal
end thereof. A sheet member is connected with the barrel
projection, said sheet member having a radially inwardly
directed protrusion extending between the vanes of a
plunger rod. If the plunger rod is rotated about the
longitudinal axis of the plunger rod, a sloping edge
portion of the protrusion digs into the outer edges of
the vanes of the plunger, to cause retention of the
plunger and the barrel. The sheet member connected with
the barrel is not intended to serve as a plunger brake,
but it has a similar function. The sheet member has
foldable tabs which may be bent around the barrel projection
for fixing the sheet member to the barrel. It is an object of the present invention to provide a
syringe having a plunger brake that may be readily
mounted to the syringe barrel in a defined position.The syringe of the present invention is defined by claim
1. According to the invention,
which is provided for syringes in which the end of the
syringe barrel away from the adapter has an annular
projection extending radially outward, the rest piece
is formed by a flat slip-on piece consisting of two
disks separated by an interval, wherein the two disks
are connected at the edges and between them, form a
receiving pocket for the annular projection of the syringe
cylinder, open toward one edge, and wherein the
disk away from the adapter is provided with a circular
opening coaxial to the syringe barrel, the diameter of
which is smaller than the internal diameter of the barrel,
and the other disk has a recess, open toward the
edge, for passage of the barrel.The edge of the coaxial opening in
the one disk forms the stopper for the plunger. This
slide-on piece guarantees firm connection with the cylinder
and

<CLAIMS>
A syringe comprising an elongate hollow barrel having
a distal end, an open proximal end and a chamber

therebetween for retaining fluid, a tip at said distal
end of said barrel having a passageway therethrough

in fluid communication with said chamber,
said barrel (1) including a radially outwardly extending

barrel projection at said open proximal end,
a plunger rod assembly (4,5) including a piston (4)

in slidable fluid tight engagement inside said barrel
(1) and an elongate plunger rod (5) connected to

said piston (4) and extending proximally through
said open end of said barrel, a plunger rod assembly

brake removably attached to said open proximal end
of said barrel (1) including a mounting member

(10,11) partially surrounding and removably engaging
said open proximal end of said barrel, a projection

on said brake for engaging a complementary protrusion
on said plunger rod assembly (4,5) so that

proximal movement of said plunger rod assembly (4,5)
with respect to said barrel (1) will cause said

projection and said complementary protrusion to engage
and prevent removal of said plunger rod assembly

(4,5) from said barrel (1) during normal use of
said syringe,
characterized in that

said mounting member (10,11) is a rest piece housing
having a planar element (10) proximally spaced from

a rest piece housing portion (11) and connected to
said rest piece housing portion (11) to form a pocket

(12) consisting of two disks separated by an interval 
and receiving said radially outwardly extending

barrel projection, said planar element (10) including
a circumferentially closed opening (13)

therethrough, said brake projection being formed in
said opening (13).
The syringe of claim 1 wherein said opening (13) is
circular and said brake projection defines an inside

diameter smaller than the inside diameter of
said barrel (1).
The syringe of claim 2 wherein said brake projection
defines a frusto-conically shaped inside diameter

being smaller on the distal side of said planar
element (10) than on said proximal side of said planar

element (10).
The syringe of one of claims 1-3 wherein said complementary protrusion on said plunger
rod (5) includes a disk-shaped structure substantially

perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of
said plunger rod (5).
The syringe of claim 4 wherein said disk-shaped

structure has a tapered frusto-conically shaped out-side
diameter being larger on the proximal side of

said disk than on said distal side of said disk.
The syringe of one of claims 1-5 wherein the rest
piece housing portion (11) has a recess (14), open

toward the edge, said recess (14) being coaxial with
the opening (13) and surrounding the barrel (1)

somewhat more than 180Â°.
