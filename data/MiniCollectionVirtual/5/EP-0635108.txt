<CLAIMS>
A multilayer synthetic material tube manufactured 
by co-extrusion for carrying motor vehicle fuel, comprising 

from the inside towards the outside, a first layer is made 
of high-density polyethylene, a second layer of polyethylene 

is made of maleic anhydride copolymer adhesive, and an 
third layer is made of polyamide. 
A tube according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the high-density polyethylene is cross-linked. 
A tube according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized 
in that the layer thicknesses are: 


polyethylene layer: 0.5 mm to 0.8 mm, 
adhesive layer: 0.2 mm, 
polyamide layer: 0.3 mm to 0.5 mm. 
A tube according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the inner layer is of polyethylene filled with an 

electrically conductive powder material to form an 
antistatic layer.
