<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to spray cooled furnace systems, 
e.g. electric and furnace systems, and more particularly to 
an assembly for raising a hollow spray cooled roof of a 
furnace and moving the roof laterally to a position away from 
the furnace and back again. The invention especially relates to a furnace roof 
lifting and moving device comprising, in combination, 
(a) a horizontally disposed, removable, substantially 
hollow, internally spray cooled roof member of an electric 
furnace formed from welded-together steel plate into a 
sloped, unitary frusto-conical structure, said roof member 
having a peripheral side portion and (ii) a generally 
centrally located vertical opening spaced inwardly from said 
peripheral side portion for the passage therethrough of 
furnace electrodes; (b) vertical mast post means for raising and lowering the 
furnace roof member and being rotatable to laterally displace 
the furnace roof member when engaged thereto; (c) a support member cooperatively engaged with said mast 
post to be raised, lowered and rotated thereby, which support 
member has a first element extending horizontally from said 
mast post above said roof member and being supportably 
engaged with said vertical mast post to be raised, lowered 
and rotated thereby. The invention also relates to a furnace roof to be used 
with such a device. Spray cooled electric furnace systems of the type 
disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,715,042, 4,815,096 and 4,849,987 
involve the spray cooling of furnace closure elements, e.g. 
removable furnace roofs, which are unitary, i.e. formed into 
one piece from steel plates, are hollow to contain spray 
elements, and typically have a generally frusto-conical shape 
with a central opening for furnace electrodes. The roof of  
 
the furnace is regularly raised, moved to the side of the 
furnace to permit charging and subsequently returned and 
lowered to enclose the furnace. The systems currently used to raise, move and lower spray 
cooled roofs are typically massive and include the use of 
multiple hoist arrangements which are expensive and time 
consuming in operation and have horizontally extending 
support members which extend across the furnace roof close to 
the central opening and which are significantly exposed at 
their middle portions to heat from interior the furnace. A device and furnace roof according to the precharacterizing 
part of claim 1 and claim 12, respectively, is 
disclosed in EP-A1-0,367,906 which is based on US-A-4,849,987.
