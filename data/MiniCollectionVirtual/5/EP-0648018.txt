<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a circuit indicating the first or last signal activated among n signals (CK1 to CKn), comprising flip-flops (30) associated respectively with signal pairs (CKi, CKj), a first signal (CKi) of each pair being applied to a 0-reset input of the flip-flop and a second signal (CKj) of each pair on a 1-setting input, and logic gates (52, 56) associated respectively with each signal in question (CKp), connected in order to indicate that the signal in question is the first or the last activated when the flip-flops associated with all the pairs of signals (CKp, CKj) including the signal in question are in appropriate respective states after the activation of the first or last signal activated.

<CLAIMS>
A circuit for indicating the signal having
the maximum lag or the minimum lag among n signals (CK1-CKn),

characterized in that it includes:

n(n-1)/2 flip-flops (30) associated each with
a different pair of signals (CKi, CKj), a first signal

(CKi) of each pair being applied to a reset input of the
flip-flop and causing a reset when activated and a second

signal (CKj) of each pair being applied to a set input
and causing a set when activated ; and
logic gates (52, 56) providing indications
respectively associated with each considered signal

(CKp), and connected to the output of the flip-flops for
indicating whether the considered signal is that having

the maximum lag or the minimum lag when said flip-flops
associated with all the pairs of signals (CKp, CKj)

including the considered signal are at respective
suitable states after the activation of the signal having

the maximum lag.
The indication circuit of claim 1,
characterized in that a gate (52, 56) associated with a

considered signal (CKp) is enabled when the flip-flops
associated with the signal pairs (CKp, CKj), in which the

considered signal is the first signal, are in a first
state, and when the flip-flops associated with the signal

pairs (CKj, CKp), in which the considered signal is the
second signal, are in a second state, opposite to the

first state.
The indication circuit of claim 1, wherein
the signals are periodical signals having the same

frequency, the states of said gates (52, 56) being 
provided to flip-flops of a register (50, 54) enabled

when all the signals are in an active state.
An adjustment circuit for adjusting the skew
between several clock signals (CK1-CKn) that have the

same frequency and respectively provided by amplifiers
(60), wherein the output impedance of the amplifiers is

adjustable, said circuit including:

the indication circuit (70) of claim 1, for
indicating the clock signal having the maximum phase lag;

and
control means (62) for controlling the
increase of the output impedances of the amplifiers (60)

associated with the clock signals different from the
clock signal having the maximum phase lag.
The adjustment circuit of claim 4, wherein
said control means include means (80) for incrementing

the impedance of an amplifier associated with a signal in
phase advance until the switching of the flip-flop (30)

associated with the pair of signals including the signal
having the maximum phase lag and said signal in phase

advance.
The adjustment circuit of claim 5, wherein
each amplifier (60) includes a plurality of inverters

(MP2/MN2) that may be individually connected in parallel
with a first inverter (MP1/MN1), depending on the state

of a register (80) whose content is modified by successive
pulses (C) provided by the control means (62).
