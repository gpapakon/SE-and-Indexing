<ABSTRACT>
A load/eject system for a magnetic tape recorder receiving a 
magnetic tape cartridge. The system provides a motor/worm 

gear/pinion and rack transport mechanism which drives a chassis 
having grippers and lifters engaged in cammed slots for gripping 

and lifting a cartridge partially inserted into the recorder and 
transporting the cartridge to an operating position. The system 

locks the cartridge in proper longitudinal and vertical position 
for operating. At that operating position, a lost motion spring 

arrangement imparts a resilient holding force of the cartridge in 
a longitudinal direction, and deflectable fingers resiliently 

clamp the cartridge in a select vertical position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mechanism for loading a
tape cartridge into a read/write unit, and particularly for
loading a 3½ inch data cartridge into a magnetic recorder.In read/write units utilizing 3½ inch data cartridge, the
data cartridge is inserted longitudinally into the read/write
unit in a direction toward a longitudinally fixed read/write head
which moves vertically to read tracks on the magnetic tape
carried in the cartridge. It is known to provide a system
wherein the 3½ inch cartridge is manually longitudinally inserted
to its operating position within the read/write unit. It is not
known in a read/write unit for a 3½ inch data cartridge to
provide a mechanical transport system for loading the cartridge
into the read/write unit. The US-A-5 025 334 and the document EP-A-0 394 581 both
disclose, according to the preamble of claim 1, a system where the read/write head of the read/write
unit is not in a longitudinally fixed position but in a side
position. They both disclose an automatic movement of the cartridge
towards the read/write head after the cartridge has
been inserted and fixed manually onto a tray or table that is
moved by the system. The systems of US-A-5 025 334 and EP-A-0 394 581 therefore refer
to different systems.A device for drawing such a cartridge into a read/write unit
which also resiliantly locks the cartridge in proper longitudinal
and elevational position is also not known.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
a tape cartridge load mechanism or apparatus for loading a
tape cartridge into operating position in a magnetic read/
write unit, ensuring an automatic loading of the tape cartridge.The object is solved by a mechanism or apparatus according to
claim 1. Claims 2 to 17 show preferred embodiments of a mechanism
or apparatus according to the invention. According to the present invention, an auto load/eject
system is provided for receiving a cartridge partially inserted
into a magnetic recorder, and transporting the cartridge inwardly
of the magnetic recorder to a proper position, horizontally and
vertically, and locking the cartridge in the proper position
securely.The auto load and eject system provides an electric motor
having a worm gear drive extending axially from its drive shaft 
and engaged to a pinion shaft arranged axially at right angles to
the drive shaft. The pinion shaft provides a drive pinion having
outer gear teeth engaged to the worm gear for axial rotation of
the pinion shaft with the motor drive shaft. The pinion shaft
