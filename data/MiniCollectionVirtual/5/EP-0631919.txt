<ABSTRACT>
A bogey spring for elastic connection between a bogey and a running gear structure of a railway vehicle is to be improved in such a way that generation of noise can be avoided even when running empty or with partial load, at the same time it is to be possible for the spring to be mounted and replaced easily and it is to be ensured that the spring can be manufactured simply and precisely without adversely affecting its function and rigidity. This is achieved in that the said spring is formed from a round spring rod (2) with at least one end (3,4) which has been rolled out flat, the rolled-out spring rod (2) being wound in a helical shape such that the rolled-flat end surface (3a,4a) extends transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction of the spring.

A bogie spring for the resilient connection between a bogie and 
a chassis structure of a rail vehicle comprising a spring bar (2) with at 

least one end (3, 4) which is rolled out flat, wherein the rolled-out 
sprig bar is wound in a helical configuration in such a way that the 

flat-rolled end surface (3a, 4a) extends transversely to the longitudinal 
direction of the spring, characterised in that the spring bar (2) is of 

round cross-section and the width (3b, 4b) of the at least one rolled-out 
spring end (3, 4) corresponds to the diameter (2b) of the round spring 

bar (2). 
A bogie spring according to claim 1 characterised in that both 
ends (3, 4) of the spring bar (2) are rolled-out flat in the same 

direction. 
A process for producing a bogie spring according to claim 1 or 
claim 2 characterized in that a round spring bar is heated approximately 

to forging temperature, then at least one end thereof is rolled out flat 
in such a way that the width of the rolled-out end of the spring 

corresponds to the diameter of the round spring bar, and that the spring 
bar which has been rolled out at the end is then wound in a helical 

configuration in such a way that the at least one end flat-rolled surface 
extends transversely to the longitudinal direction of the spring. 
A process according to claim 3 characterised in that the spring 
bar is drawn through at least one pair of rollers, wherein the two 

rollers are brought into pressure contact with the spring bar only in the 
region thereof which is to be pressed flat. 
A process according to claim 3 or claim 4 characterized in that 
the rollers are driven at a lower peripheral speed than the speed at  

 
which the spring bar is pulled therethrough. 
A process according to claim 3, claim 4 or claim 5 characterised 
in that the rollers are driven and moved into and out of the rolling 

position under computer control in dependence on the position of the 
spring bar and the speed at which it is pulled therethrough.
