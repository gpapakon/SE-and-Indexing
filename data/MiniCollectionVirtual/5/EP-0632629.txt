<ABSTRACT>
Updated operating code and parameters can be 
reprogrammed into a modem system with no disassembly 

of the modem hardware. The modem system includes an 
in-circuit reprogrammable memory chip (3,17) in which 

operating code and parameters are stored. Two control 
programs control the reprogramming of updated 

operating code. One of the control programs is 
designed for manufacturing and testing purposes. The 

other control program allows remote reprogramming of 
updated operating code or parameters from a remote 

location such as a customer site. The modem system is 
portable, obtaining po
wer from a standard 9 volt 
battery. Therefor, various power saving features are 

also incorporated into the modem system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
communications systems and in particular to a modem in
which the firmware which controls the operation of the
modem can be changed or upgraded remotely.Presently, there are several mechanisms
through which software upgrades, bug fixes and the
like are distributed to users. In systems employing
firmware storage of operating programs, such as
Electrically Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM) and
the like, bug fixes or enhancements to system firmware
require programming a new EPROM with the updated code
and shipping the new EPROM to the customer. A
technician then travels to the site, disassembles the
hardware, and replaces the old EPROM with the new one.Unfortunately, these methods are very
inconvenient. First, a considerable time delay is
encountered while waiting for the manufacturer to
program and ship the replacement parts. Second, the
hardware may not be operable if the user is waiting
for a bug fix. Especially true in cases of bug fixes
where the hardware might not be operable without the
updated operating code. Also, the replacement of the
old with the new EPROM requires a technician to travel
to the site and use special tools to disassemble the
hardware and replace the outdated on faulty part or
parts. This results in an increased expense for
repairs or upgrades because technician time and
special tools are required. Current update methods
are thus time consuming, expensive and inefficient.There is a need in the art, therefore, for a
modem which allows remote changes and/or upgrades to
be made to the firmware stored operating code, without
requiring disassembly and replacement of parts, 
technician time, or special tools, thus resulting in the more
efficient and cost effective means of updating firmware.IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol 26, No 1, June 1983
pages 261-262 "Dynamic Setting of modem parameters" discloses
dynamic setting of modem parameters and includes a discussion
of modems provided with non volatile random access memory.To overcome the shortcomings in the art described above, and
to provide other advantages which will become apparent upon
reading and understanding the present specification comprises
reprogrammable modem system, comprising:
a communications module, the module comprising:communications interface means connected for
communicating with a first device for transferring data
between the first device and the communications module;telephone line interface means for connection to a
telephone line;control means for executing operating
