<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to pentapeptide
pharmaceutical compositions and uses thereof, in
particular, uses thereof for
making a pharmaceutical preparation for
treatment of
immunodepressed states and of opportunistic
infections in immunodepressed states associated with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.The present invention is based in part on the
discovery that certain pentapeptides exhibit a broad
range of efficacy for prevention and treatment of
opportunistic infections in immunodepressed states,
and for therapeutically effective treatment of
immunodeficient states, particularly AIDS. This is
believed to be highly unexpected for such a
relatively small compound to exhibit such a broad
range of activity. Furthermore, we have not found
any significant side effects from the use of the
peptides according to the present invention. Due to
its simple nature, the pentapeptides are relatively
inexpensive to manufacture.As used herein, the terms "immunomodulator" and
"immunomodulating" encompass the activity of
enhancing or restoring the subject's immune system, 
as evidenced by measurable blood parameters and/or
the patient's improved ability to combat infection or
disease, and the ability to heal tissue. Hence,
immunomodulation encompasses improvement of the
immune system due to an immunodeficient state (for
example, caused by removal of the thymus), and/or an
immunodepressed state (for example, caused by
exposure to radiation). Furthermore, the present
invention provides for modulation of the immune
system by lowering blood parameters and other indicia
of the immune state if these indicia are abnormally
elevated. The present invention encompasses the
therapeutic method of treating the immunodeficient,
immunodepressed or elevated immune state perse, thus
providing prophylaxis against infection and disease,
as well as a treatment of infection or disease
indirectly by enhancing the immune system.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide pharmaceutical compositions of the pentapeptide
which have broad immunomodulating activity,
as well as activity for other uses such as treatment
of infections, enhancement of metabolic processes,
and many other uses.These and other objects will be apparent from the
following description and appended claims.The present invention provides pharmaceutical
preparations comprising a pentapeptide of the Formula
I, using the normal convention wherein the first
named amino acid is the amino terminus and the last
named amino acid is the carboxyl terminus.
