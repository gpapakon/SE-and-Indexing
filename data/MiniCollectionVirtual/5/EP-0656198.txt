<ABSTRACT>
An artificial body vessel to be inserted into a human organ is 
collapsed and introduced into a catheter, which is brought to a required 

position in the human organ, where the artificial body vessel is 
released therefrom. A pair of foldable, elastic wire rings 10 are 

provided at the opposite ends of the artificial body vessel. A 
plurality of connecting wire rings bridge the end wire rings 10. A 

plurality of intermediate wire rings 12 bind and keep the connecting 
wire rings 11 transformed to a generally elliptical shape. The end 

wire rings 10, the intermediate wire rings 12 and the connecting wire 
rings 11 are folded thereby to collapse the artificial body vessel 7. 

The collapsed artificial body vessel 7 is inserted into a catheter. 
At the objective position of the blood vessel the artificial body 

vessel 7 is released, so that the resiliency of the end wire rings 10, 
the intermediate wire rings 12 and the connecting wire rings 11 

restores the artificial body vessel 7 to its original tubular shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for introducing
a medium into a human body.At present, treatment of, say, aortic aneurysms is
conducted by implanting artificial blood vessels. In
particular, the portion of a blood vessel which has an aneurysm
is removed by resection, and an artificial blood vessel is
implanted in place of the resected portion and connected to the
remaining blood vessel by suturing.The above mentioned method of surgically implanting
artificial blood vessels for treatment of aortic aneurysms,
however, is highly dangerous. Especially, emergency operation
for treatment of a ruptured aneurysms has a low life-saving
rate, and operation on dissecting arotic aneurisms is difficult
and has a high death rate.The document US-A-4878906 discloses a device for introducing a
stent into a human body which comprises a tube having a side
window adjacent to its front end. Furthermore, it comprises a
second window in a certain distance from the first window. The
tube is to be inserted through a stent. A wire which is
inserted through the tube extends so as to protrude from the
first window and to be reinserted into the second window,
whereby the stent can be engaged and held by the tube and the
wire.The present invention has been accomplished to solve the
above-mentioned problems encountered in the prior art. The
object of the present invention is to provide a device for
introducing a medium into a human body as well as a method for preparing a system containing such a device.This object is achieved by the device according to claim 1 and by a method according to claim 11. Further advantageous features subject-matters of the dependent claims.An advantage of the
invention is that a medium or an appliance is provided which is
collapsible for insertion into human organs, such as a blood
vessel, and which can be brought to an affected or constricted
part thereof, where the appliance is released so as to be
expanded and implanted there without fail.  The appliance collapsible for insertion into human organs and
capable of resilient restoration
comprises a pair of foldable, elastic end wire
rings are provided at opposite ends; that a plurality of foldable,
elastic connecting wire rings having a generally circular shape
when no external force is applied thereto are provided to bridge
the opposite end wire rings and fixed thereto; and that a plurality
of intermediate wire rings are provided between the opposite
end wire rings so as to keep the connecting wire rings resiliently
transformed to a generally

<CLAIMS>
A device for introducing a medium into a human body
comprising:


a tube (2) having a front end, wherein said tube is
formed with a side window (1) adjacent its front end, said

tube (2) is prepared to be inserted through said medium;
a wire (3) inserted through said tube, slidably
received therein and extended through said front end of

said tube so as to extend inside and along said side window
(1) of said tube; and
at least one string (4), having a first end being
fixed to said tube adjacent said side window (1) and a

second end, said string (4) being arranged so as to be
engaged with said medium and wound around said wire (3)

where said wire extends inside and along said side window
of said tube, so as to have its second end releasably fixed

to said tube (2).
A device according to claim 1, further comprising a
flexible guide tube connected to said front end of said

tube.
A device according to claim 2, wherein said flexible
guide tube further comprises a coil spring. 
A device according to claim 2 or 3, wherein said
flexible guide tube is short.
A device according to claim 1, further comprising a
long flexible guide tube connected to a rear end of said

tube.
A device according to claim 5, wherein said long
flexible guide tube further comprises a coil spring.
A device according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein said wire (3) is slidably supported within said

tube (2).
A device according to claim 1, wherein said at least
one string (4) further comprises a second end, said second

end being nipped between said tube (2) and said wire (3) so
as to be held by said tube and said wire.
A device according to claim 8, wherein said second end
of said at least one string (4) is formed into a knot (14).
A system consisting of a device according to any of
the preceding claims and a medium to be introduced into a

human body, wherein a front opening of said medium is
provided with at least one loop (13) through which said

string (4) is passed.
Method for preparing a system according to claim 10 to
be subsequently inserted into a catheter comprising the

following steps: 

introducing said tube (2) through said medium so that it
extends beyond its front end;
passing said string (4) through said loops (13) and
winding it about said wire (3) in a half, one or several

turns at the side window (1) of said tube (2).
Method according to claim 11, further comprising the
steps of


taking said front end portion of said wire (3) out of
the side window (1);
winding said string (4) about said wire (3);
inserting the front end of said wire (3) into said tube
(2).
Method according to claim 11, further comprising the
step of


nipping said string (4) between the edge of the side
window (1) and said wire (3) so that the string (4) is held

securely.
