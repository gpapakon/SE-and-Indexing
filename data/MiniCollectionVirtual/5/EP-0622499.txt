<ABSTRACT>
The fastening device is for a plate (15), one side 
edge of which is been inserted in a groove (7) in a 

building component, such as a window frame, a flashing 
slat, etc., wherein the width of the groove is substantially 

larger than the thickness of the plate (15), and 
wherein one side surface of the plate (15) abuts one 

side wall of the groove (7). The fastening device 
comprises a spring clip device (10) for pressing against 

the second side surface of the plate (15) and preventing 
movement of the plate (15) in a direction out of the 

groove (7) by means of a catching fin (4) engaging in 
the second side surface of the plate (15). The spring 

clip device (10) comprises a foot part (1) having a 
width substantially corresponding to the width of the 

groove (7) at its bottom and having barbs (2) at at 
least one of its sides, adapted to penetrate into the 

side wall of the groove (7), and an upright part (3), 
extending obliquely upwards in relation to and across 

the foot part (1). The catching fin (4) extends 
obliquely downwards from the upright part (3) to the 

same side as the foot part (1) and at a distance from 
it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fastening device
comprising a spring clip device comprising a foot part
with an upright part extending obliquely upwards in
relation to and in over the foot part, wherein at a
distance from the foot part, a catching fin extends
obliquely downwards from the upright part to the same
side as the foot part.A fastening device of this type is known from EP-A-0
262 282 which relates to a clamp suitable to secure
two panels together to form a picture holder and apt to
have a frame applied to it. The clamp is shown in
different embodiments mounted in undercut grooves in
frame elements.The invention also relates to an assembly comprising
the fastening device of the invention.The assembly of this type is known from the publication
EP-A-0 221 766 relates to spring clips of
various types for retention of plates which constitute
the sides of a lining for a window. Fig. 9 of said
publication shows a spring clip, and Fig. 8 shows how
the clip is fastened by means of a screw on a slightly
bevelled side wall in a groove in a wooden frame. When
the plate is pressed into the groove, the catching fin
of the spring clip will give way until the plate has 
reached the bottom of the groove. The tip of the
catching fin will be pressed against the plate owing to
the spring power and, depending on the quality of the
plate, will cut slightly into it so that an outward
pull in the plate will cause the tip to penetrate
further into the plate and in this manner increase its
power of retention so that the plate becomes more
difficult to pull out of the groove.However, the hardness of the plates used may vary
so that either the tips of the fins cannot get a good
grip on the plate, or the plate is not firm enough to
resist the load normally originating from the weight of
the lining. Therefore, the lining is also retained by
means of screw fittings known per se, which are positioned
on the outside of the lining.The object of the present invention is to provide
a fastening device and an assembly as mentioned above,
whereby the fastening of a plate in a groove by means
of spring clip devices is simplified in relation to
known art.This object is achieved by means of a fastening
device of the type mentioned above, which is characterized
in that the foot part is provided with barbs
extending outwardly and upwardly at at least one of its
sides.The object is further achieved by means of an
assembly comprising a building component, such as a
window frame, a flashing slat, etc., a plate and a
fastening device according
