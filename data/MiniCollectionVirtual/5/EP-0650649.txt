<ABSTRACT>
A method for optimizing the use of channels, the changing of channels and handover procedures in a mobile telecommunications system for instance, wherein parameters (C/I, P, I, L, N,  rho , m) belonging to the mobile telecommunications system generate the load values (Bc, Bp, Bi, Bl, Bn, B rho , Bm) for the connections via different channels/base stations between subscribers in a public telephone network and mobile stations in the mobile telecommunications systems. Different kinds of parameters can be compared directly by means of the load values (Bc, Bp, Bi, Bl, Bn, B rho , Bm) which are combined (S1-S5) to provide a total load value (Btot2, Btot4) for each connection. A first total load value (Btot2) is generated for a connection set-up between one of the subscribers and one of the mobile stations. The total load values (Btot4, Btot5) for the connection are estimated for alternative channels/base stations and these total load values are compared with the first total load value (Btot2). The system changes to the channel/base station that has the most favourable load value (Btot4), on the basis of the comparison. The load values (Btot2, Btot4) can also be used to optimize the resources within one or more base stations, so that the sum of the load values for the connections within one or more base stations will become the most advantageous.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for setting-up a
connection in a radio communications system which includes at
least one first radio station having at least one transmitter/receiver,
wherein the radio communications system has
access to channels that are intended for connections between
at least one first subscriber and at least one further radio
station, and wherein the properties of the connections are
contingent on system parameters. The invention also relates
to handover procedures, optimization of channel utilization
and channel changes, and also relates to an arrangement for
carrying out these methods and procedures.When setting-up connections between two subscribers in a
mobile telephone system for instance, two-directional
connections are established between mobile stations and base
stations. Each connection includes two channels, of which one
is used for communication from one of the mobile staions to
one of the base stations, and the other channel is used for
communication in the opposite direction. It can be established
whether or not the properties of a connection are sufficiently
good for two-directional communication, by measuring parameters
which reflect the properties of the connection.One method of determining the properties of a connection
between a base station and a mobile station is to calculate
the C/I-value of the connection. This can be effected both in
the uplink, i.e. the connection from the mobile station to the
base station, and in the downlink, i.e. the connection from
the base station to the mobile station. In the case of the 
uplink, the C/I-value is the quotient between the signal
strength C of a mobile station detected by a receiving base
station and the sum of the signal strengths of interfering
mobile stations in the local cell or in neighbouring cells
detected by said base station. Thus, the C/I-value is a
measurement which is used as a parameter in determining
whether or not the properties of a connection are sufficiently
good.A channel can be allocated a connection in a known manner when
the channel fulfils a predetermined criterion. In this regard,
one method of channel allocation is to estimate the C/I-value
of all channels, by assuming a given transmission power, among
other things. The criterion for channel allocation is to
allocate the channel that has the highest C/I-value. One
drawback with this method is that the channel is not allocated
on the basis of the actual need of the mobile, and instead the
mobile is allocated the best channel, meaning

third total load value (B
tot5
) is less advantageous than
the sum of the aforesaid alternative total load values.
The arrangement according to claim 29 or 30, 
characterized in
that
 the radio communication system (PLMM) is comprised of a mobile
telephone system (PLMN), the radio stations are comprised of base

stations (BS1, BS2) and the further radio station (MS1) is
comprised of a mobile station, and wherein the first connection is

set-up between the first subscriber (A) and a first of the mobile
stations (MS1) via the base station (BS1), said first connection

being loaded with the first total load value (B
tot2
), and a second
connection is set-up between a second subscriber (A2) and a second

of the mobile stations (MS4) via a second of the base stations
(BS2), said second connection being loaded with a fourth total load

value, wherein the system is constructed to generate the
alternative total load values partly for the connection between the

first subscriber (A) and the first mobile station (MS1) via the 
second base station (BS2) and partly for the connection between the

second subscriber (A2) and the second mobile station (MS4) via the
first base station (BS1), and wherein the system is constructed to

change base stations so that the connection between the first
subscriber (A) and the mobile station (MS1) will use the second

base station (BS2) and the connection between the second subscriber
(A2) and the second mobile station (MS4) will use the first base

station (BS1), when the sum of the first total load value (B

tot2
) and the fourth total load value is less advantageous
than the sum of the aforesaid alternative total load

values.
The arrangement according to any one of claims 29 to 40,

characterized in that
 the first radio station (BS1) has access to
at least one subset of the system channels (K1, K2, K3) on which

connections are set-up, said connections being set-up via the first
radio station (BS1), and wherein the comparator (KOMP1) is

constructed to choose one of the parameter sets such that the
sum of the total load values for the connections which

belong to the first radio station (BS1) will be optimally
advantageous.
