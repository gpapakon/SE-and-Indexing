<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a self-service payment counter comprising at least one conveyor (1, 2) and a computer and at the input side for the articles, a stationary scanner (4) for the customer and possibly a customer display (6) and a display (8) and a keyboard (9) for registering of unregistered articles by an operator. The invention is characterized in that a keyboard (5) preferably having symbols at the input side and a scale (3) which is integrated in the conveyor (1) cooperate via the computer with the scanner (4) and/or the keyboard (5) for identifying an article or numbers thereof. Moreover, sensors (7) are arranged along the conveyor (2) which inform, the operator about the kind of the articles and their position on the conveyor (2) and which can stop the conveyor automatically when an unregistered article passes a sensor (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self service payment 
counter of the kind that is used in grocery stores and the 
like where the customer himself places his articles on a 
conveyor belt which passes a cashier who receives payment 
for the articles and where the customer himself collects 
his articles and removes them from the counter after 
payment. Payment counters of different kinds are earlier known. They 
are mainly based on the principle that a conveyor moves the 
articles past a cashier who registers the value of each 
article in a cash register after which the articles are 
collected in an area from where the customer can pack them 
into bags. To facilitate the work of the cashier, the 
majority of the articles are provided with a code which 
makes it possible for the cashier to merely let the code on 
the article pass a detector which, by means of a computer, 
registers the price of the article. For articles which have 
not been registered by means of a code, the cashier has to 
register the price manually by means of a key board. More recently check out desks have been further developed 
and i.a. detectors or so called scanners have been arranged 
at the input side for the articles on the conveyor, which 
scanners are used by the customer for registering the 
articles. One or more such detectors are arranged along the 
track for the articles. The aim with these check out desks 
is that the articles shall be registered automatically 
without manual service so that the cashier only has to 
receive the payment. It has, however, turned out that it is  
 
difficult to bring about such a payment counter which works 
automatically without being too dependent on the readiness 
of the customer for the registration. An example of such a 
desk is disclosed in the international patent application 
No WO 90/13873. A great number of customers also have difficulties in 
following given advice and some are also apt to cheat so 
that an article becomes "free" or is registered as an 
article having a lower price. To prevent this cheating a 
cover has some times been arranged above that part of the 
conveyor on which the article runs. Desks of prior art are described for instance in WO 
91/10962 and US patent 4 964 053. The desks of these 
patents with the exception of the US-patent are limited to 
registration of goods marked with a price article code. The 
desks are provided with systems for preventing errors or 
cheating by the customer. The main technical problem with the manual payment counters 
is that
