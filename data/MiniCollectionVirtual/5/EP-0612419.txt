<ABSTRACT>
A composition of matter including an onium salt and a method of forming images. The onium salt has a chromophore which absorbs ultraviolet radiation, an S, Se, As, N or P atom which is free of substituents exhibiting a higher energy occupied molecular orbital than the chromophore; an insulating group which links the chromophore to the S, Se, As, N or P atom of the salt and substantially prevents (pi) resonance from the chromophore through the S, Se, As, N or P atom; and an anion. The onium salt is capable of forming a Bronsted acid upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation in the presence of a proton source. In the method of forming images, the onium salt is exposed to ultraviolet radiation in the presence of a proton source, to convert said onium salt to a Bronsted acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TJLTRAVIOLET LIGHT SENSITIVE ONIDM SALTS AND THE USETHEREOF AS PHOTOINITIATORSThis invention relates to certain novel onium salts and, more particularly, to ultraviolet light sensitive onium salts. It also relates to the use of such salts as photoinitiators.It is well known that various onium salts, upon exposure to radiation, are capable of forming a Bronsted acid, and that the Bronsted acid thus formed can cure a wide variety of materials. See, for example, UV Curing: Science and Technology, edited by S. Peter Pappas and published (1978) by Technology Marketing Corporation, 64 estover Road, Stamford, Connecticut 06902. The problem with such salts is that they do not absorb out to 400 nm, and commonly must be used in combination with a light-absorbing photosensitizer in order to carry out photoinitiation at longer wavelengths than 300 nm. Research Disclosure Vol. 289, May 1988, page298, published by Kenneth Mason Publications Ltd., London, England, describes sulfonium salts and oxysulfonium salts which, upon exposure to visible radiation, undergo irreversible intramolecular rearrangement to form a Bronsted acid. The light- absorbing capability of these sulfonium and oxysulfonium salts depends upon overlap of molecular orbitals, that is, π resonance throughout the molecule. The photo products of these salts absorb at shorter wavelengths than the starting sulfonium and oxysulfonium salts.European Patent Application 0 447 544, published September 25, 1991, discloses onium salts which form Bronsted acids upon absorption of visible radiation by means of a chromophore joined to the remainder of the molecule by a linkage which interrupts 

π resonance. The chromophore can be selected to match the wavelength of the visible light. The onium salts have; as a substituent on a S, Se, As, N, or P atom in addition to the linked chromophore; at least one electron withdrawing group which exhibits a lower unoccupied molecular orbital than the chromophore.There is a need in the art for onium salts which absorb ultraviolet radiation, are highly efficient and are thermally stable to the release of acid. It is desirable that such salts be capable of forming a Bronsted acid upon exposure to ultraviolet light of a chromophore joined to the remainder of the molecule through an insulating linkage, since the chromophore could be selected to match the desired exposing radiation.In the broader aspects of the invention, there is provided a composition of matter including an onium salt and a method of forming images.
