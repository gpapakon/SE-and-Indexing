<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tubular bobbin core (10) onto which 
roving or slubbing (11) is wound and which is able to be 

transported overhead with its axis substantially vertical, 
suspended by its upper part. In order to avoid unwinding 

of said roving or slubbing during core transport, said 
core shows, in a tube portion below the wound area, at 

least one projecting part (14) which can grip the running end 
of the roving or slubbing wound on by a winding machine or 

freely uncoiling from the wound bobbin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tubular cores for yarn 
bobbins, on which is wound roving or slubbing as the final 
operation prior to spinning in a manner already known on 
appropriate machinery. These bobbins, in the most recent automatic machines, are 
usually transported from the winding machines to the 
spinning bays in a suspended condition from overhead rails 
to which the individual bobbin tubes are hooked, hanging 
down freely with their axes substantially vertical. In this position, the running end of the roving or 
slubbing can fall away from the rest of the bobbin and 
hang down towards the ground. Under these conditions, such 
bobbins often uncoil, especially if the hanging running 
end of the roving or slubbing touches the ground or comes 
into contact with anything that retains it. In cases where 
such automated plants are left operating unattended for 
relatively long periods e.g. over a weekend, a 
considerable quantity of roving or slubbing can accumulate 
along the transporter path, resulting in a significant 
waste of material and in a labour cost of cleaning-up. The present invention proposes a tube of the type used for 
the purpose stated above, which eliminates the 
aforementioned drawbacks in a cheap and simply manner, and 
ensures that the running end of the roving or slubbing is 
kept on the tube while it is being transported without  
 
increasing the work at the end of the winding or the 
beginning of the unwinding steps. According to the present invention, what above is achieved 
by a tubular core onto which roving or slubbing is wound 
and which is able to be transported overhead with its axis 
substantially vertical, suspended by its upper part, 
characterized in that it shows, in a tube portion below 
the wound area, at least one projecting part which can 
grip the running end of the roving or slubbing wound on by 
a winding machine or freely uncoiling from the wound 
bobbin. Said projecting part, generally formed by a ring element 
with one or more gripping teeth or one or more areas with 
a high coefficient of friction for the roving or slubbing, 
may be an integral part of the tube or fitted to it. The external diameter of such projecting part will be 
slightly greater than the tube itself if the winding 
machine is set in such a manner to pull the running end of 
the roving or slubbing on it, or said diameter will be 
greater if the projecting part has to catch the end of the 
roving or slubbing when freely hanging from the bobbin. The present invention will now be

<CLAIMS>
A tubular bobbin core onto which roving or slubbing is 
wound and which is able to be transported overhead with 

its axis substantially vertical, suspended by its upper 
part, characterized in that it shows, in a tube portion 

below the wound area, at least one projecting part which 
can grip the running end of the roving or slubbing wound 

on by a winding machine or freely uncoiling from the wound 
bobbin. 
A tubular core according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that said projecting part is in the form of a ring 

component with one or more studs or teeth radially 
directed toward the outside. 
A tubular core according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that said teeth have an essentially sawtooth shape, all 

teeth being oriented in a direction opposite to that of 
the roving or slubbing uncoiling. 
A tubular core according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that said teeth show an essentially isosceles trapezoidal 

shape with their larger base at the outside. 
A tubular core according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that said projecting part is in tha form of a ring 

component having one or more areas of high coefficient of 
friction with respect to the roving or slubbing. 
A tubular core according to one of the preceding 
 

claims, characterized in that said projecting part is 
formed by a separately produced ring component which is 

fitted to the lower end of the tubular core. 
A tubular core according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the diameter of said 

projecting part is slightly larger than the outer diameter 
of the core itself. 
A tubular core according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the diameter of said projecting 

part is in the size order of the external diameter of the 
roving or slubbing windings.
