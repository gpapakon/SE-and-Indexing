<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a universal joint
for the transmission of torque between two rotatable
shafts. The present invention has particular
application in motor vehicles, and in particular for
providing drive to steerable driven wheels on a motor
vehicle.It is well known to provide a universal
joint of the Rzeppa type between two rotatable joint.
A Rzeppa joint is a constant velocity joint which
typically comprises an inner race connectable to one
shaft, an outer race connectable to the other shaft,
and a number of balls retained in a ball cage between
the two races. This type of joint provides for
transmission of torque between the two shafts such
that the torque input and torque output are
substantially constant up to an angle of approximately
42° between the two shafts, beyond which the torque
output starts to decrease relative to the torque
input. At an angle of approximately 45°, the shaft
connected to the inner race comes into contact with
the outer race to prevent further increases in the
angle between the two shafts.There is a need to provide a universal joint
which will allow for angles between the shafts of up
to approximately 60°. The above mentioned Rzeppa
joints could be modified by chamfering the outer edge
of the outer race to allow for greater angles.
However, such a modification reduces the running area
for the balls, and weakens the outer race. US Patent
No. 3,310,960 discloses a high angle, constant
velocity, universal joint which consists of a Rzeppa
joint integrated in a ball joint. This arrangement is
complicated and expensive to produce, and would
require an additional ball cage for the numerous outer
balls in order to retain the balls in the joint. It is also well known to provide a universal
joint of the tripot type between two rotatable shafts.
A tripot joint typically comprises an outer housing
connectable to one shaft, an inner housing connectable
to the other shaft, and trunnions connected to the
inner housing and axially slidable and tiltable in
channels in the outer housing. In a tripot joint, the
output speed fluctuates sinusoidally relative to the
input speed, with the pitch of the sinusoidal wave
increasing as the angle between the shafts increases.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a universal joint which will allow for angles
between the shafts of up to approximately 60°, but
which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages.To this end, a universal joint in accordance
with the present invention comprises a Rzeppa joint,
as herein defined,

<CLAIMS>
A universal joint (10) for transmitting
torque between two rotatable shafts (28,46) comprising

an inner race (16) connectable to one of the shafts; a
substantially annular outer race (18) surrounding the

inner race and pivotable relative to the inner race; a
ball cage (22) positioned between the inner and outer

races; a plurality of balls (20) retained by the ball
cage and rotatable in corresponding grooves (30,32) in

the inner and outer races; a substantially annular
inner housing (18) secured to and surrounding the

outer race; a substantially annular outer housing (38)
surrounding the inner housing and connectable to the

other shaft, the inner housing being pivotable
relative to the outer housing; characterised in that a number of

substantially cylindrical trunnions (40) is secured to
the inner housing, extending in a radial direction

towards the outer housing, and slidable and tiltable 
in axially extending channels (50) in the outer

housing; wherein the inner race, the outer race, the
inner housing, and the outer housing are substantially

concentric.
A universal joint as claimed in Claim 1,
wherein the outer race (18) and the inner housing (18)

are integrally formed.
A universal housing as claimed in Claim
1 or Claim 2, wherein the inner housing (18) can only

pivot relative to the outer housing (38) when the
angle between the two shafts (28,46) exceeds

approximately 45°.
A universal joint as claimed in Claim 3,
wherein a resilient mounting means (54) is secured to

the inner and outer housings (18,38) to restrict the
pivotal movement of the inner housing relative to the

outer housing.
A universal joint as claimed in Claim 4,
wherein the outer housing (38) is substantially

cup-shaped and has a base (42) and an annular wall
(44) upstanding from the base, the inner housing (18)

being positioned inside and adjacent the wall, the
resilient mounting means (54) being secured to the

base and to the inner housing.
A universal joint as claimed in Claim 5,
wherein the resilient mounting means (54) is a

laminate comprising a first layer (56) adjacent the
base (42) and a second layer (58) adjacent the inner

housing (18), and wherein the second layer is harder
than the first layer.
A universal joint as claimed in Claim
6, wherein the first layer (56) is of elastomeric

material, and the second layer (58) is of steel.
