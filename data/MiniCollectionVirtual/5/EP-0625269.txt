<ABSTRACT>
A three-dimensional waveguide has path regions which share a common confining region, preferably of uniform refractive index. The path regions are located at two or more levels. The structure is implemented in silica with distributed dopants to distinguish path regions from the confining region. The structure is made using flame hydrolysis to deposit layers. Melting point depressants are incorporated so that later deposited layers can be melted without melting the whole structure. Some layers of pure silica can be deposited by chemical vapour deposition. These layers are never melted and they provide a stabilising skeleton when complicated structures are melted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to waveguides in which a substrate
provides the mechanical support for the functional structure.
As is conventional, the functional structure comprises path
regions having a higher refractive index enclosed in a
confining region, having a lower refractive index.In many implementations of waveguides of the type described
above, the characteristic functional pattern of the path
regions can be fully described in two dimensions. In one
configuration, the waveguide takes the form of ribs of path
material which project from a substrate having a planar
surface and this configuration is sometimes called a "rib
waveguide". Air is capable of acting as the confining region
for silica (or doped silica) ribs and, therefore, functional
structures are achieved if the ribs are left exposed.
However, it is more usual to cover these ribs with a material
of lower refractive index, because covering reduces
transmission loss and it also protects the ribs, e. g. against
mechanical damage and against contamination. Where the path
region is covered the structure is often known as a "channel
waveguide".Waveguides as described above are used to provide a variety
of functions, e.g. couplers, splitters, ring resonators and
as other optical signal processing elements.It has been proposed that channel waveguides be implemented
in silica, and silica is also used to make waveguides in the
form of fibre. In fibre technology dopants such as GeO2, TiO2
and B2O5 are used to increase the refractive index of the core
(which constitutes the path region of a fibre). It is also
known to use dopants such as boron and fluorine to decrease
the refractive index of the cladding (which constitutes the
confining region of a fibre). These dopants provide the 
optical function of the fibre waveguide, but it is also known to use dopants such
as boron, phosphorous and fluorine to reduce the melting point of silica, in order to
facilitate processing. The dopants used to reduce the melting point may affect the
refractive index and this must be taken into account when selecting the
concentration of the dopant used to adjust refractive index. Boron tends to reduce
the refractive index whereas phosphorous increases the refractive index of the
silica, but they both reduce the melting point. Therefore a balanced mixture
provides a melting point depressant which has little or no effect upon the refractive
index. Dopants are also used to support lasing, e.g. rare earths such as Nd and Er.US patent specification 5059475 relates to integrated
