<ABSTRACT>
The error correction system measures the motor position for given phase current combinations, each of which is associated with an error-corrected position. The motor position for one phase current combination is measured for a number of different motor loadings to determine the load-dependent phase shift. Pref., the phase shift is determined at the different motor positions for a number of phase current combinations to determine the dependence of the phase shift on the motor position.

An error correcting method for driving a stepper motor which can be driven in main and 
intermediate steps by phase current combination, in which by way of measurements, motor 

positions at certain phase current combinations are recorded, whereupon an error corrected motor 
position is allocated to each phase current combination and taken into account in the control, 

characterised in that by way of measurements, motor positions at at least one given phase current 
combination but at various motor loads can be recorded, whereupon the phase shift dependent 

on the load may be determined and taken into account in the control. 
An method according to claim 1, characterised in that the determination of the phase shift 
is effected at various phase current combinations at a different motor position and that the phase 

current shift is effected dependent on the motor position. 
A method according to claims 1 or 2, characterised in that before determining the load 
dependent phase shift, the phase current courses of the individual phases are altered in the signal 

size relative to one another, so that the error component which has the same periodicity as the 
individual phases becomes reduced. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that before determining the load 
dependent phase shift, the phase current courses of the individual phases are altered in the phase 

position relative to one another, so that the error component which has the same periodicity as 
the individual phases becomes reduced. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that before determining the 
load dependent phase shift, the phase current courses between the main steps are so modulated 

that the stepper motor comprises a spring constant which is largely independent of the motor 
position.  

 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that during the operation of 
the motor, the motor loading is determined and transmitted to the motor control for the purpose 

of the error correction.
