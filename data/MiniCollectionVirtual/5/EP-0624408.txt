<ABSTRACT>
To separate heavy metals from contaminated materials, a mixture of degradable organic matter (24) and water is fed to the contaminated material to be mixed together as a suspension with oxygen cover. The solubility of the heavy metals is increased by reducing the pH value of the suspension by the microorganisms in the organic matter (24) which form organic acids (28) and convert the heavy metals into a watery phase (26). The matter predominantly free of heavy metals is separated from the watery phase (26) and the watery phase containing heavy metals (26) is passed to a biogas reactor (20). The solubility of the heavy metals in the watery phase (26) is reduced by biological degrading of the organic acids (28) by oxygen exclusion in the biogas reactor, for heavy metal compounds to be formed by the heavy metals which dissolve with difficulty, to be separated from the watery phase (26) free of heavy metals.

A method of separating heavy metals from contaminated
materials, in particular disperse solids, soils, organic

wastes, sewage sludge and the like
characterized by
 the following steps:

a) Supplying decomposable organic substance (24) and
water into the material contaminated with heavy

metals;
b) Mixing the resulting suspension in the absence of
oxygen and increasing the solubility of the heavy

metals by reducing the pH value of the suspension by
means of organic acids (28) forming from the organic

substance (24) by means of microorganisms in the
absence of oxygen and converting the heavy metals

into an aqueous phase (26);
c) Separating the material now largely free of heavy
metals from the aqueous phase (26) containing the

heavy metals;
d) Feeding the aqueous phase (26) containing the heavy
metals into a biogas reactor (20);
e) Reducing the solubility of the heavy metals in the
aqueous phase (26) by biologically decom
posing the
organic acids (28) formed in step b) in the absence

of oxygen in the biogas reactor (20), thus forming
not readily soluble heavy metal compounds; and
f) Separating the not readily soluble heavy metal
compounds from the aqueous phase (26) now free of

heavy metals.
