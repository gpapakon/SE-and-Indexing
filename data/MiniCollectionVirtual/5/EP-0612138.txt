<ABSTRACT>
An electricity generator for uses such as camping, gardening and boats has an internal combustion engine (20) whose engine shaft (22) is operatively connected to a rotor (34) of a generator (30), which items are accommodated in a framework (12) which supports these components. In order to simplify production and design as well as to achieve economical manufacture it is proposed to use a standard production lawnmower engine (20) whose standard production engine shaft end section (24) is connected in a rotationally locked manner to an end section (42) of the rotor (34), said end section (42) being matched to the end section (24), and furthermore to provide an adaptor (50) which can be fitted on one side to the existing mounting points on the lawnmower engine (20), and on the other side is connected to the generator (30).

Electricity generator for purposes such as 
camping, gardens or boats, having an internal-combustion 

engine whose engine shaft (22, 92) is operatively connected 
to a rotor (34, 106) of an electricity-producing 

generator (30, 100), and having a framework (12) which 
supports these components, characterized in that the 

internal-combustion engine is a standard-production 
lawnmower engine (20, 90) whose standard-production 

engine shaft end section (24) is directly connected to an 
end section (42) of the rotor (34, 106) which is matched 

to this end section (24), and in that an adaptor (50) is 
provided which, on the one hand, is fitted to existing 

mounting points on the lawnmower engine (20, 90) and, on 
the other hand, is connected to the generator (30, 100). 
Electricity generator according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the end section (42) of the rotor 

(34, 106) is designed as a sleeve (44, 104) in which the 
standard-production end section (24) of the motor shaft 

(22, 92) is accommodated. 
Electricity generator according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the end section (24) of the engine 

shaft (22, 92) is cylindrical and is provided along an 
outer line with an outer groove (26), in that an axially 

running groove (46) is provided on the inside of the 
sleeve (44) on the end section (42) of the rotor (34), 

and in that a key (48) is provided, which extends both 
into the groove (26) on the motor shaft (22) and into the 

groove (46) in the sleeve (44) so that, in consequence a 
rotationally locked connection is produced between the  

 
engine shaft (22) and the rotor (34). 
Electricity generator according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that a standard-production 

generator is used as the generator (30, 100), whose 
standard-production rotor is replaced by a rotor (34, 

106) whose end section (42) is matched to the end section 
(24) of the engine shaft (22) of the lawnmower engine 

(20). 
Electricity generator according to one of Claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that the adaptor (50) can be 

fitted, on the standard-production generator side, at 
mounting points which exist on the latter. 
Electricity generator according to one of Claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the assembly comprising the 

lawnmower engine (20) and the generator (30) is mounted 
on the framework (12) via the adaptor (50). 
Electricity generator according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that the assembly is mounted on the 

framework (12) via damping elements (66), such that 
vibration is damped out. 
Electricity generator according to one of Claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that the adaptor (50) is 

designed as a separate adaptor plate (52, 82) which is 
matched on one side to the lawnmower engine (20) and on 

the other side to the generator (30). 
Electricity generator according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that at least one opening (84) is 

provided in the adaptor plate (82), through which opening 
(84) cooling air can reach the area of the oil sump of 

the lawnmower engine (20, 90). 
Electricity generator according to one of Claims 
1 to 9, characterized in that a spacer (110) is fitted 

between the lawnmower engine (90) and the generator 
(100). 
Electricity generator according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that the spacer (110) is pushed over the 

engine shaft (92), and in that it is matched to the 
respective contour of the lawnmower engine (90) and 

generator (100) in the area in which it rests on them.  
 
Electricity generator according to one of Claims 
1 to 11, characterized in that the lawnmower engine (20) 

is arranged in an upper region of the framework (12), in 
that its end section (24), which points downwards, of the 

engine shaft (22) runs coaxially with the rotor (34) of 
the generator (30), which is arranged underneath the 

lawnmower engine, and in that the adaptor (50) is connected 
to the framework (12) such that vibration is 

damped out. 
Electricity generator according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that the engine shaft (22) and the rotor 

axis run vertically when the framework (12) is upright.
