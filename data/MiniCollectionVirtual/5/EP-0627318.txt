<ABSTRACT>
A "barrier reef" configuration, comprising a plurality 
of cays, or pillars, (
26
) is provided, each pillar associated 
with the entrance to a firing chamber (
15
) in a thermal 
ink-jet printhead. Each firing chamber is formed in a 

photopolymer layer (
17
), together with an associated barrier 
inlet channel (
14
) that fluidically communicates with 
a common ink feed channel (
18
) which acts as a common reservoir 
to the each firing chamber, in which resides a resistor 

element (
16
). When energized, the resistor element 
fires a droplet of ink toward a print medium. Over each 

resistor element is a nozzle (
20
), formed in an orifice 
plate (
22
), for firing the droplets of ink orthogonal to 
the resistor element. The pillars, which are positioned 

near the ink refill channel, serve to support the orifice 
plate and act as pillars between the substrate (
12
) and the 
orifice plate, thereby avoiding any pinching effect that 

would otherwise occur for an unsupported region. Advantageously, 
the pillars are spaced apart by an amount equal to 

the smallest dimension of the system and are placed as 
close as possible to the common ink feed channel so as to 

keep contaminant particles outside the firing chamber and 
in the common ink feed channel region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printheads employed 
in ink-jet printers, and, more particularly, to control of 
internal particle contamination. Ink-jet pens comprise a reservoir of ink and a print-head 
comprising a plurality of orifices from which ink is 
expelled toward a print medium, such as paper. Between the 
reservoir of ink and the printhead are passages, including 
a plurality of firing chambers and a plenum for supplying 
ink to the firing chambers. Each firing chamber includes 
a resistive heating element, which is energized upon demand 
to fire a droplet, or bubble, of ink through the orifice 
associated with that resistor. The orifices through which the ink is expelled in the 
printhead are on the order of 50 µm in diameter. The passages 
can be as small as widths of ∼40 µm and heights of 
∼25 µm. Any particles larger than about 25 µm can become 
trapped at various locations within the pen in or near the 
firing chamber and cause clogging. Of course, smaller particles 
can also become trapped, depending on the aspect ratio 
of the particle. Such clogging, of course, interferes 
with the quality of the printed image.  
 Present ink-jet pens have a fine mesh filter to separate 
internal particle contamination from the bulk ink supply 
before the ink reaches the firing chambers. The mesh is 
sized to about 25 µm. However, as ink-jet technology is used 
to produce higher resolution printing, a smaller diameter 
jet, or orifice, is required. This is achieved by 
decreasing printhead nozzle diameter. As a result, an 
increase in the internal particle problem is anticipated. 
If this is true, then a finer mesh filter may be required, 
which in turn would require a larger filter area so as to 
minimize pressure drop across the filter. These changes 
would affect pen design, cost, and manufacturing strategy. In US-A-4882595 there is disclosed an ink-jet printhead 
including a plurality of ink-propelling elements, each of 
which comprises a resistor element disposed in a separate 
drop ejection chamber. The drop ejection chamber is defined 
by three barrier walls and a fourth side which is open to a 
reservoir of ink common to at least some of the ink-propelling 
elements and which defines a barrier inlet 
channel. The printhead also includes a plurality of nozzles 
comprising orifices disposed in a cover plate near the ink-propelling 
elements for ejecting a quantity of ink through 
the orifices towards a print medium in defined patterns to 
form alphanumeric characters and graphics thereon, and
