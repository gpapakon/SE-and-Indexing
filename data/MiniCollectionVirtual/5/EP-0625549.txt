  where   R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each independently of the others hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted C1-C4-alkyl,   B is an aliphatic bridge member, Y1 and Y2 are independently of each other halogen or carboxypyridinium, A1 is the radical of an anthraquinone, phthalocyanine, dioxazine, formazan or disazo dye or a radical of the formulae (2a) to (2h) indicated in claim 1, and A2 has the meanings indicated above for A1 or is a radical of the formulae (2i) to (2m), with the proviso that A1 and A2 have different meanings, are suitable in particular for dyeing or printing hydroxyl- or nitrogen-containing fibre materials. The dyeings are obtained in a high yield with good fastness properties.
