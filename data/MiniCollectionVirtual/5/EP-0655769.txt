<ABSTRACT>
A method, apparatus and system for preparing ions for electrospray and restoring signal 
sensitivity to mass spectrometric analysis of chromatographic effluents containing ion pairing 

species, in particular, strong acids or the salts of strong acids. Through the addition of high 
concentrations of weak acid before or during droplet formation stage, the suppressive effects 

of TFA and like chromatographic additives are eliminated and the signal sensitivity of 
spectrometric analysis restored.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for preparing an electrospray ion 
source, for example to improved electrospray performance in the presence of certain high-performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC) additives, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 
which behave as ionic species in chromatographic effluent. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has recently gained enormous popularity 
as a technique bridging high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass 
spectrometric analysis. The electrospray phenomenon (also known as electrohydrodynamic 
atomization) is a process of disintegration of a liquid surface in the presence of a strong 
electric field into a spray of fine, highly charged droplets. In electrospray mass 
spectrometry, solutions of involatile organic molecules and biopolymers (such as proteins 
and DNA) are electrosprayed to produce a large number of small, highly charged droplets 
containing the components of interest. The solvents are rapidly evaporated from the 
droplets and the residual biopolymer ions are transported through orifices or capillaries into 
a mass spectrometer where mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) are accurately determined. As an 
interface between liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, electrospray's popularity 
is due not in small part to its sensitivity, but to its ability to analyze compounds of large 
molecular weight on standard mass spectrometry instrumentation through the techniques of 
multiple charging and mathematical deconvolution as well. These characteristics, among 
others, make electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) particularly useful in biochemistry 
and protein science. A substantial impediment to reaping the full benefits of electrospray mass 
spectrometry, most particularly to the remarkable degree of ESMS sensitivity, is the 
presence of signal-suppressing solvents in the chromatographic effluents. Certain solvents 
or mobile phase additives widely used in high-performance liquid chromatography severely 
curtail the sensitivity of subsequent analysis through ESMS. For example,trifluoroacetic 
acid (TFA) is widely used in high-performance liquid chromatography because it is uniquely  
 
suited to protein and peptide related chromatography owing to its excellent 
chromatographic/ion pairing characteristics, its low UV absorbance in the range in which 
proteins and peptides absorb (200-220 nm), and its volatility. One drawback to TFA, 
however, is that it suppresses signal in ESMS analysis of HPLC effluent. That is to say, the

A method of preparing an electrospray ion source of the type which includes an ionization 
chamber (18) comprising the steps of: 


a) selecting an effluent mixture (22) which contains the anions of a strong acid that has a 
dissociation constant (pKa) of three or less; 
b) adding to the effluent mixture an additional flow fluid (28) that contains a weak acid 
that has dissociation constant of three or greater; 
c) forming a resultant mixture (32) wherein the weak acid is present in greater 
concentration than the strong acid; 
d) controlling mixing of the resultant mixture (32); and 
e) introducing the resultant mixture (32) into the ionization chamber (18). 
A method as in claim 1, including the step of selecting the strong acid from the group 
consisting of trifluoroacetic acid(TFA), heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), hydrochloric acid
