<ABSTRACT>
A hinged door is provided for covering the slot opening in a magnetic recorder 
housing through which tape cassettes are loaded and unloaded. The door rotates 

inwardly of the recorder housing when opened. A specially configured fulcrum device 
is disposed within the recorder housing and connected to the door to normally bias 

the door closed. For loading a cassette into the recorder housing, the biasing force 
exerted by the fulcrum device on the door is overcome by the force of the operator 

pressing the inwardly facing, leading edge of the cassette against the door. Upon 
unloading of a cassette from the recorder housing, the bottom surfaces of the cassette 

engage a cam surface connected on the fulcrum device and the cassette is pressed 
down on the cam surface so as to again overcome the biasing force on the fulcrum, 

such that the door is swung open in advance of the cassette being ejected from the 
recorder housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnetic tape recorder in which an elongate,
rectangular tape cartridge or cassette is endwise loaded and unloaded from a
rectangular recorder housing. In particular, the invention relates to a mechanism for
opening the access door of the recorder housing, through which the tape cartridge is
passed for loading and unloading.The endwise loading and unloading of a rectangular magnetic tape cassette in a
magnetic tape recorder housing has been known for some time. See U.S. Patent
4,573,091. Within such magnetic tape recorders, the magnetic tape contained in the
cassette records data or has its data read therefrom. The magnetic tape cassette is
constructed in accordance with standard specifications, and generally appears as
depicted in U.S. Patent 3,976,262.In the case of such magnetic recorders the recorder housing includes a
generally rectangular base and upstanding, generally rectangular outward face wall.
The outward face wall of the magnetic recorder housing is exposed to the operator for
loading the tape cassette into and unloading the tape cassette from the interior of the
magnetic recorder. The outward face wall of the housing is formed with a generally
rectangular slot having dimensions slightly larger than the ends of the tape cassette,
so that when the end of the cassette is aligned with the slot, the cassette is easily
insertable therethrough. As is generally known, after the tape cassette has been
partially loaded into the recorder housing through this access slot, the cassette is
engaged by an automated mechanism which continues the endwise movement of the
cassette until the cassette has been fully inserted into the recorder housing. When
unloading of the cassette from the recorder housing is desired, the operator engages
the automated mechanism within the recorder housing to reverse the process and 
cause the cassette to be endwise ejected through the access slot in the outward face
wall, where upon the operator can manually grasp the outward facing end of the
cassette and remove the cassette fully from the housing to complete the unloading.As is also known, the access slot formed in the outward face wall of the
recorder housing may be provided with a hinged door, which serves to prevent the
ingress of dust and other possibly harmful matter from passing through the access
slot. See, for example U.S. Patent 4,622,606.In document DE-A 4 129 945 a door opening mechanism is
disclosed which is activated due to the movement of a toothed
wheel which is connected to the

<CLAIMS>
Magnetic recorder housing having a
rectangular slot (2) formed in the outward face wall (0)

thereof and through which magnetic tape cassettes (C) of
rectangular configuration pass for loading and unloading in

the recorder housing (R), comprising :

a rectangular shaped door (1) disposed on said recorder
housing (R) to cover said slot (2), said door being hinged at

one end thereof for rotation between a closed position and an
opened position;
a generally elongated member (6) disposed within said
recorder housing (R) and journalled for rotation about an axis

(8) parallel to the axis of rotation of the door hinge, one
end of said elongated member (6) being connected to a side

edge of said door
a spring force applied to said elongated member (6) such
that said one end normally holds said door (1) closed;

   characterized in that

said one end being connected approximate the journaled
end of said door (1); and
the other end (10) of said elongated member is extending
across the travel path of a magnetic tape cassette (C), said

rotation of said elongated member being induced by said
magnetic tape cassette (C) abutting said other end (10).
The magnetic recorder houging
of claim 1, wherein said door (1) rotates

inwardly of said recorder housing (R) to open.
The magnetic recorder housing of claim 1 or 2, further comprising an
abutment surface (3) formed on the other end of said door for

engagement against a hard stop (4) formed in the frame of said
recorder housing (R) when said door is closed, such that

rotation of said door (1) beyond said hard stop (4) is
prevented and the other end of said door (1) is sealably

closed against said hard stop (4) under the influence of said
spring force.
The magnetic recorder housing of claim 2, wherein said spring force is
provided by a spring arm (11) and said elongated member (6) is

integrally formed with said one end, said other end, and said
spring arm (11).
The magnetic recorder housing of claim 1, wherein the rotational
movement of said elongated member (6) is defined by an arc-shaped

groove (14) formed in a wall (13) between said one end
of said elongated member (6) and said side edge of said door

(1) and through which groove (14) said one end of said
elongated member (6) and said side edge of said door (1) are

connected.
The magnetic recorder housing of claim 1, wherein said other end of said
elongated member (6) is formed as a curved cam surface (10)

over which the bottom surface of the cassette (C) being
unloaded must pass en route to said door (1) covering said

slot (2).
The magnetic recorder housing of claim 6, further comprising an abutment
(15) located approximately above said cam surface (10) of said

elongated member (6), said abutment (15) being engaged and
holding down said cassette (c) being unloaded against said cam

surface (10), so as to overcome the spring force on said 
elongated member (6), causing said elongated member (6) to

swing open said door (1) in advance of said cassette (C) being
unloaded from said recorder housing (R).
