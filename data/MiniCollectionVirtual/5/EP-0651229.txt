<ABSTRACT>
A firing head for a firing system adapted for use in a perforating gun 
includes an outer pressure bulkhead housing which simultaneously 

conducts two separate and independent currents: a wireline current from a 
wireline and a return current from an initiator embodied in the firing head. 

A fire set circuit provides a discharge pulse to the firing head, and a wireline 
conductor cable p
rovides a wireline current to the fire set circuit. The firing 
head includes an outer pressure bulkhead housing adapted for conducting 

the wireline current from the wireline conductor cable to the fire set circuit, 
and an exploding foil initiator (EFI) responsive to the discharge pulse from 

the fire set circuit for initiating the detonation of a secondary explosive. The 
discharge pulse energizing the firing head passes through the exploding foil 

initiator (EFI) and emerges from the EFI as an EFI return current. As a 
result, the outer pressure bulkhead housing of the firing head conducts two 

separate and independent currents: the EFI return current from the EFI to 
a ground potential, and the wireline current from the wireline conductor 

cable to the fire set circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a firing system adapted for use in a perforating 
gun connected to a wireline conductor cable in a wellbore, and more particularly, 
provides an exploding foil initiator (EFI) firing system for use in the perforating 
gun, the EFI firing system including an outer housing adapted to function as an 
electrical conductor for conducting a return current to ground potential from the 
EFI firing system and a wireline current from the wireline conductor cable. EFIs have been used for initiating the detonation of a secondary explosive. For 
example, US Patent 4,788,913 to Stroud et al discloses a typical EFI. In 
addition, US Patent 3,978,791 to Lemley et al and US Patent 4,471,697 to 
McCormick et al also disclose EFI or "slapper" detonators. Furthermore, US 
Patent 4,441,426 to Barrett and US Patent 4,762,067 to Barker et al disclose the 
use of exploding foil initiators in a perforating gun for propelling a flying plate 
into a secondary explosive and detonating the perforating gun. In addition, US 
Patent 5,088,413 to Huber et al discloses an exploding foil bubble activated 
initiator for use in a perforating gun. However, although these initiators perform 
well, certain additional problems, associated with the use and/or performance of 
EFIs in general and the exploding foil bubble activated initiator of the Huber et  
 
al patent in particular, in a perforating gun wellbore environment, have yet 
to be solved. For example, initiation of a perforating gun string in a wellbore can be 
accomplished using secondary explosives, such as HNS4. This explosive can 
be initiated using an EFI that receives a high energy pulse from a 
fire set. Typically, the fire set consists of a high voltage power supply, an 
energy storage capacitor, and a switch that rapidly dumps stored energy 
into the EFI through a high frequency connector. This connector must have 
a very low effective series resistance (ESR). However, after detonation, the 
fire set must be contained in a protected housing which is isolated from the 
well fluids and the pressures in the wellbore. Therefore, a pressure 
bulkhead must be electrically and physically connected to the fire set and 
the EFI for electrically connecting the fire set and the EFI to ground 
potential so that the EFI can ultimately detonate the secondary explosives 
in the perforating gun string. In addition, when perforating oil wells, 
sometimes it is necessary to selectively shoot multiple guns in the same gun 
string. In order to detonate the gun
