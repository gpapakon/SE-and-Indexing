<ABSTRACT>
An improved power factor DC power supply in 
accordance with the present invention (100 or 200) 

employs a power factor correcting network (120), a 
full-wave rectifier means (122), a pair of filter 

capacitors (124 and 126), and three current steering 
diodes (128, 130 and 132). The power factor 

correcting network (120) includes both an inductor 
means (136 and 240) and a capacitor (138), the 

combination configured to improve the power factor DC 
power supply (100 or 200) presents to the AC power-line 

(102) by reducing the level of harmonic currents 
the DC power supply generates on the AC power-line. 

The filter capacitors (124 and 126) are configured 
with the current steering diodes (128, 130 and 132) 

such that the filter capacitors are charged in series 
and discharged in parallel. In addition, the filter 

capacitors (124 and 126) and the current steering 
diodes (128, 130 and 132) are configured such that 

during the periods when the level of the voltage being 
developed across the load (104) exceeds one-half the 

peak level, the improved power factor DC power supply 
(100 or 200) functions as though the filter capacitors 

were not in the circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the power factor
which loads present to AC power-lines generally and
more specifically to the reduction of the harmonic
currents generated on an AC power-line by a DC power
supply.The power factor, PF, that a load presents to an
AC power-line has long been of concern. Typically, DC
power supplies employ a bridge rectifier, a filter
capacitor, and sometimes a filter choke. The input of
the rectifier is coupled (by a fuse, switch, etc.)
across an AC power-line. The output of the rectifier
is either coupled by a series choke across the
capacitor (choke input filter) or, in the absence of the
choke, directly connected across the capacitor
(capacitor-input filter) to develop a DC output potential
across the capacitor.With the choke (input filter), DC power supplies
draw from the AC power-line a current the waveform of
which approximates a square wave (when the inductance
of the choke is much greater than what is commonly
referred to as the "critical" inductance). Without the
choke, the waveform more approximates a series of
pulses each of which is synchronized with a
corresponding peak of the AC power-line potential. In
either case, the current drawn from the AC power-line
includes harmonic components, one for each of the odd
harmonics of the AC power-line frequency. DC power supplies do not conform to all of the
old power factor conventions. (For example, it makes
little sense to define the power factor a DC power
supply presents to an AC power-line as the cosine of
the phase angle between the voltage developed across
the input of the DC power supply and the current
flowing into it.) However, DC power supplies do
present many of the same problems. DC power supplies,
like other loads having a relatively low power factor,
draw from the AC power-line a current the rms level of
which is disproportionately high in relation to the
current that should be drawn for the power consumed.
[In other words, they do conform to the definition
which states that the power factor of a load (in this
case, a DC power supply) is given by the ratio of the
actual power consumed to the apparent power.]
Capacitor-input filter type DC power supplies present
to an AC power line a power factor, PF, of
approximately 58% and generate on the line harmonic
currents (the total harmonic distortion, THD) the
level of which is approximately 160%.A relatively high AC power-line rms current is of
concern in that the AC power-generating facilities and
AC power-transmission facilities (lines and
transformers) must
