An image-bearing member for supporting thereon 
images formed by a thermofusible or heat-softening ink 

comprising a dye coloring component, at least part of 
said image-bearing member comprising a paper layer which 

comprises cellulose fibers and a decolorising agent 
capable of decolorising the dye coloring component of 

the thermofusible or heat-softening ink.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image-bearing 
member comprising a support material, at least part of 
which comprises a paper layer capable of bearing images 
formed by a thermofusible or a heat-softening ink, which 
image-bearing member can be recycled, and a method for 
recycling the above-mentioned image-bearing member. Because of recent rapid development of office 
automation, a large quantity of papers for printers and 
copying machines has been used and consumed. This has 
caused the problems of the environmental disruption of 
the earth due to deforestation. Conventionally, in order to recycle papers of this 
kind, printed ink is removed from the paper, and the ink-free 
paper is crushed and paper is made therefrom again. 
This has been an only method of recycling this kind of 
paper materials. However, recently a method for recycling used copy 
papers by cleaning printed images off the surface of the  
 
copy paper has been developed, and examples of such a 
recycling method have been described, for instance, in 
the following references: There is proposed a sheet-shaped image-bearing 
member for supporting images thereon. This image-bearing 
member can be reused by treating one side of the sheet to 
make releasable, and this kind of sheet is distinguished 
from a plain copy paper by marking the sheet. However, 
this kind of sheet has the following drawbacks: 
(a) This surface-treated image-bearing sheet is a 
special paper, so that it is not easy to apply this sheet 
to the commonly used copying machines and printers. (b) Therefore, it is difficult to mix this surface-treated 
papers and plain copy papers and use them in the 
same copying machine. (c) In view of the significance of recycling resources, 
duplex copies which bear images on both sides thereof are 
useful and will become very popular in the future. Under 
such circumstances, however, the method for recycling 
copy papers by applying a releasing agent to one side of 
a copy paper is neither effective nor useful. (d) Since a releasing agent is applied to a support 
sheet, the image fixing performance thereof is poor as a 
matter of course. A toner-image-bearing copy paper is immersed into an 
organic solvent in which a resin contained in the toner 
images formed on the copy paper is soluble, and is then 
subjected to an ultrasonic wave treatment, thereby 
removing toner images from the copy paper. This method, 
however, has the shortcomings that organic solvents used 
cause air pollution problems and are ignitable and toxic,

comprises cellulose fibers and a decolorising agent 
capable of decolorising the dye coloring component of 

the thermofusible or heat-softening ink. 
An image-bearing member as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein said paper layer further comprises at least one 

component selected from the group consisting of a 
surfactant and a water-soluble polymer. 
The image-bearing member as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein said decolorising agent is a bleaching agent 

capable of bleaching the dye coloring of the 
thermofusible or heat-softening ink. 
A method of recycling an image-bearing member 
comprising a support material, at least part of said 

support material comprising a paper layer which 
comprises cellulose fibers and bears images formed by a 

thermofusible or heat-softening ink which comprises a

decolorising the dye coloring component of the 
thermofusible or heat-softening ink; and 
peeling said images off said paper layer by an image 
peeling-off member with the application of heat and/or 

pressure thereto. 
The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein said 
aqueous solution of said discolorising agent further 

comprises at least one component selected from the group 
consisting of a surfactant and a water-soluble polymer. 
A method of recycling an image-bearing member 
comprising a support material, at least part of said 

support material comprising a paper layer which bears 
images formed by a thermofusible or heat-softening ink 

comprising a dye coloring component, and comprises 
cellulose fibers and a decolorising agent capable of 

decolorising the dye coloring component of said 
thermofusible or heat-softening ink, comprising the 

steps of: 

bringing said image-bearing member into contact with 
water, or an aqueous solution of at least one component 

selected from the group consisting of a surfactant, a 
water-soluble polymer, and said decolorising agent, and 
peeling said images off said paper layer by an image
