<ABSTRACT>
A support member (22) capable of holding a laminated core member having a predetermined axial length with 
opposite axial end faces of the core member held down is used to hold a small size laminated core member (24) having 

a smaller axial length and a spacing element (48) having a thickness substantially equal to the difference in axial length 
between these laminated core members and interposed between one axial end face of the laminated core member (24) 

and a cap element (32) of a support member (22). Then the laminated core member (24) and the spacing element 
(48) held by the support member (22) are received in a mold (20) which can form a conductor portion integrally with 

the laminated core member which is held by the support member (22) and has the predetermined length. With this 
position kept, molten metal is poured into slots (38) of the laminated core member (24) and annular spaces (44, 46) 

to solidify for integral forming of a conductor portion on the laminated core member (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
producing a squirrel-cage rotor for an induction motor, 
and more particularly to a method of producing a 
squirrel-cage rotor wherein a conductor portion is 
integrally formed within a laminated core member by a 
casting process. Also, the present invention relates to 
a device for carrying out this method. In the field of induction motors, a cast squirrel-cage 
rotor, which includes a laminated core member made 
by stacking magnetic laminations, and a conductor portion 
integrally formed with the laminated core member by 
pouring molten metal, such as molten aluminum or copper, 
into a plurality of slots provided in the laminated core 
member, is well known. Such a cast squirrel-cage rotor 
has the advantage of good productivity, and thus is 
frequently used in induction motors as, e.g., drives for 
machine tools. One example of a conventional casting process for a 
squirrel-cage rotor is described below with reference to 
Fig. 6a. In this casting process, a plurality of 
laminations forming a laminated core member 1, are held 
by a holding member 2 in a laminated state, and then are 
placed together with the holding member 2 in a mold 3. 
Thereby, axially extending slots 4 are formed at an outer 
periphery of the laminated core member 1. Also, 
balancing ring members 5 are generally arranged for 
ensuring a rotor balance at respective axial ends of the 
laminated core member 1. The outer diameters of the 
balancing ring members 5 are smaller than the outer 
diameter of the laminated core member 1, whereby annular 
cavities 6 for communicating the cavities of the slots 4  
 
with each other are formed at respective axial ends of 
the laminated core member 1 placed in the mold 3. The laminated core member 1 accommodated in the 
mold 3 is positioned in such a manner that, e.g., the 
axis thereof is vertically oriented. Then, molten metal 
is poured, at a predetermined pressure, into the mold 
cavity through a gate 8 from a molten-metal pouring 
opening 7 located beneath the laminated core member 1. 
In this case, the molten metal flows in a direction 
opposite to gravity and successively fills one (lower) 
annular cavity 6, slots 4, and the other (upper) annular 
cavity 6, whereby secondary conductors in slots 4 and end 
rings in annular cavities 6 are respectively formed 
integrally with the laminated core member 1. The mold 3 
is provided with a plurality of air-vents 9 for 
communicating the other (upper) annular cavity 6 with the 
outside of the mold.
