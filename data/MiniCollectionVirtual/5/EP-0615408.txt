<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a field trap for selective capture of one or 
more species of fly primarily, but not necessarily exclusively, for analysis of 
fluctuations in the population of the species. Field fly traps are widely used in agricultural research and pest monitoring to 
assess when and how best to apply insecticide sprays or adopt other measures 
to protect a field of crop. The simplest traps for this purpose comprise one or more strips of brightly 
coloured adhesive and, optionally, insecticide-coated paper, or a simple 
water-containing bowl which is often brightly coloured as an attractant to flies 
and which may have additional surfactant to assist in drowning flies which 
land in the water. These traps are however non-discriminatory, the choice of 
attractant colour having little effect in selection of fly species, and give rise to 
considerable problems in subsequently discriminating between the insect 
corpses to identify the species in question. A more refined prior art technique involves use of a "lobster pot" trap which 
comprises an open-topped pot substantially sealed, in use, by a lid but having 
a funnel-shaped entrance in the base thereof for entry of insects (see Figure 
1). This trap is mounted to a stake which raises it above ground level in use.  
 The base of the pot (B) is usually opaque while the main body and upper 
portions (A) of the pot are transparent. The light within the pot and any 
suitable chemical attractant which is placed therewithin acts to entice the 
flies up through the funnel entrance into the pot where it is intended that 
they will subsequently become disorientated and fail to find their way out 
again. Whereas the lobster pot design of trap is comparatively more effective in 
selecting the desired species of fly rather than the two afore-mentioned traps, 
it is not reliable. This design of pot relies heavily upon the selectively 
attractive effect of the chemical attractant and is liable to give misleading 
results due to seasonal and daily variations in the heating of the pot thereby 
giving rise to fluctuating rates of emission of the chemical attractant which 
vaporises far more readily under the glare of the mid-summer sun. A further 
problem that arises is desiccation and embrittlement of the fly specimens. It is a general objective of the present invention to provide a species selective 
fly trap which overcomes the problems of conventional traps. A species-selective field trap for flies which comprises a receptacle having a

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A species-selective field trap for flies which comprises a receptacle (1) 
having a removable lid (4) and a base (7) said receptacle forming a 

substantially closed chamber (5), when the lid is in place, within which a 
source of chemical attractant vapour attractive to the selected species of fly 

and unattractive to most other species or fly is positionable and having one or 
more small apertures (6) in a/the side of the receptacle (1) or the lid (4) 

thereof, said apertures being the primary means by which the chemical 
attractant vapour is emitted from the receptacle (1) the receptacle (1) having 

a substantially opaque upper end extending for a major proportion of the 
height of the receptacle (1) and which is coloured as a visual attractant to the 

selected species of fly, and characterised in that the one or more small 
apertures are adapted to closely accommodate passage of the selected 

species of fly therethrough and the base of the receptacle is translucent. 
A field trap as claimed in Claim 1, wherein a shroud (9) is provided 
extending downwardly from the base. 
A field trap as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the receptacle (1) is 
adapted to be partially filled with an entrapment liquid. 
A field trap as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the aperture(s) (6) of the 
receptacle are located substantially immediately above the level to which it is 

intended that the entrapment liquid will rise in use. 
A field trap as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the inner face 

of the lid of the receptacle has a retaining member (8), (8') for the source of 
chemical attractant.  

 
A field trap as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the retaining member (8') 
is adapted to provide a snap-fit mounting for a vial containing the chemical 

attractant. 
A filed trap as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the trap has a 
main body portion (1) and a base (3) the base (2) being that portion within 

which the flies collect, in use, the main body portion (1) and the base (2) 
being separable. 
A field trap as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the trap 
further comprises a vial containing the source of chemical attractant and said 

vial has a rubber septum. 
A field trap as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein the one or 
more small apertures have a diameter of approximately 6 millimetres.
