<ABSTRACT>
A method and device for scissor cutting strip 
material, whereby a continuous strip (10) is fed by a 

conveyor (9) to a cutting station (11) where it is cut 
into bands (3) by a cutting unit (12) presenting a 

number of inner blades (30) with a cutting edge (37) 
parallel to the surface of the strip (10), and 

corresponding outer blades (27) with a cutting edge (28) 
sloping in relation to the cutting edge (37) of the 

inner blades (30); each inner blade (30) travels with 
the conveyor (9) through the cutting station (11) in 

time with a corresponding outer blade (27), and is 
gradually moved through the conveyor (9) into a 

partially extracted cutting position so as to be 
gradually engaged by the oblique cutting edge (28) of 

the corresponding outer blade (27) and so scissor cut 
the strip (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
device for scissor cutting strip material.Here and hereinafter, the term "scissor cutting"
is intended to mean a cut made by two blades contacting
each other at successive points, which contact may be
made in two distinct ways depending on whether the
planes of the two blades are inclined or parallel to
each other.With blades in inclined planes, scissor cutting is
normally effected by "grazing" of the substantially
coplanar cutting edges of the blades which are moved
substantially crosswise to their planes. With blades in
parallel planes, on the other hand, scissor cutting is
normally effected by "penetration", the cutting edge of
one blade being positioned obliquely in relation to that
of the other, and the two blades being moved in relation
to each other within the plane.Both the above scissor cutting methods are used to
advantage in the tobacco industry in general, and in the
manufacture of cigarettes in particular to which 
specific reference is made in the following description
purely by way of example, and wherein scissor cutting is
employed, among other things, on filter assembly
machines, for cutting filter-cigarette connecting bands
from a continuous strip.Connecting bands are known to be graze scissor cut
from a continuous strip using the device described in
US Patent n. 4,943,341 granted to the present Applicant,
wherein a strip feed roller presents a number of
inclined blades, the cutting edge of each of which is
grazed at successive points by the cutting edge of a
respective blade on another roller to cut the strip into
segments.Though highly accurate, in general, graze scissor
cutting as described in the above patent requires
relatively accurate assembly of the blades, adapts
poorly to variations in temperature, and is subject to
relatively severe wear of the cutting edges of the
blades.In an attempt to overcome the above drawbacks,
British Patent Application n. 2,220,878 relates to a
penetration scissor cutting device comprising a conveyor
roller for feeding a continuous strip to a cutting
station and in turn comprising a succession of
peripheral suction sectors separated by grooves
extending along respective generating lines of the
roller. Each of the grooves presents a cutting edge and
is gradually engaged, in the region of the cutting 
station, by the oblique cutting end of an outer blade
positioned substantially radially on a cutting roller
parallel to and rotating in the opposite direction and
in time with the conveyor roller.The above

A method of scissor cutting strip material, the
method comprising the steps of:


feeding a continuous strip (10) onto a first rotating
cutting cylinder (9) and into a cutting region (11) in

between of the first cutting cylinder (9) and a second
cutting cylinder (12) parallel to the first cutting

cylinder (9) and rotated in synchronisation therewith,
the first cutting cylinder (9) comprising a plurality of

circumferentially spaced first cutting means (30) and
transport segments (15) therebetween for holding the

strip (10) at a peripheral surface (14) of the first
cutting cylinder (9); the second cutting cylinder (12)

comprising a plurality of second cutting means (27)
having second cutting edges (28), which are inclined in

relation to an axis (23) of rotation of the second
cutting cylinder (12) so that, in the cutting region

(11), the successive second cutting means (27) engage
with the first cutting means (30), progressively and in

a longitudinal direction of the first cutting means
(30), to cut the strip (10) into strip segments (3); and
successively transporting the strip segments (3) held
by the transport segments (15) to a conveyor (4);

characterised in that each first cutting means (30)
comprises a cutting blade (30) arranged in a radially

and longitudinally extending slit (16) provided through
said peripheral surface (14); each cutting blade (30) 

having a first cutting edge (37) and being radially
movable in the relevant slit (16) between a first

position, in which said first cutting edge (37) is
inside said peripheral surface (14), and a second

position in which said first cutting edge (37) protrudes
out of the slit (16) and outside said peripheral surface

(14); each cutting blade (30) being moved so that the
relevant first cutting edge (37) protrudes outside said

peripheral surface (14) at least when the cutting blade
(30) travels through the cutting region (11), and is

arranged inside said peripheral surface (14) when the
cutting blade (30) travels through another region.
