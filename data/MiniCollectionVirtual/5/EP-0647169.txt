<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for holding a tool assembly in a constant position relative to a non-planar surface. For this purpose, the assembly comprises a plate (2) and a number of acoustic sensors (11, 12, 13, 14, 15) mounted thereon. The attitude of the plate may be adjusted by means of a gimbal system (5-7) enabling the plate to be pivoted (arrows 6 and 8) so that each acoustic sensor remains at an approximately constant distance (D) away from a corresponding area on the component (S) and the sensor axis remains approximately perpendicular to said area. Contactless checking of components with complex surfaces may thus be performed.

A method for keeping a set of tools (1) in a 
constant relative position with respect to a non-planar 

surface (S), the set of tools (1) and/or the surface (S) 
moving with respect to one another and having to remain 

spaced apart from one another by a constant distance (D), 
characterized in that : 


from at least two points integral with the set of 
tools (1), at least two separate signals are transmitted 

towards the surface (S), these signals being received, 
after reflection on the surface (S), by the transmission 

points or by separate receiving points close to the 
respective transmission points, 
one of the signals reflected by the surface (S) is 
processed so as to ensure that the corresponding 

transmitted signal travels a constant preset distance (D), 
this signal serving as a reference signal, 
a maximum tolerable time offset (I) is fixed between 
the travel times of the two signals from the moment when 

they are transmitted up to the moment when they are 
received, 
and, as soon as the maximum tolerable offset (I) is 
exceeded, action is taken on the set of tools (1) so as to 

separate or bring closer to the surface (S) at least one of 
the points of the set of tools (1) from where the signals 

are transmitted. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, in which more 
than two signals are sent from separate points on the set 

of tools (1), characterized in that all the transmission 
points (12-15) are arranged at an equal distance from a 

central transmission point (11) of the reference signal. 
The method as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that it is applied to a contactless 

component checking system. 
A device intended to work on a component with a 
non-planar surface and implementing the method as claimed  

 
in any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it 

includes: 

a plate (2) carrying at least two signal 
transmission and reception means (11-15), arranged 

substantially perpendicularly to the plate (2), 
a control mean (9, 10) making it possible to bring 
together and/or to separate each of the transmission means 

(11-15) of the surface (S) of the component, 
means (P
A
;P
B
) for detecting the offset in the travel 
times of the two signals from the moment when they are 

transmitted up to the moment when they are received, and 
means (18) invoking the mean (9, 10) of controlling 
the movement of the transmission means with respect to the 

surface (S), depending on the response from the detection 
means (P
A
;P
B
). 
The device as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 
that one of the transmission and reception means (11) 

transmits a reference signal ensuring that the transmission 
means is kept at a constant distance (D) with respect to 

the surface. 
The device as claimed in either of claims 4 or 5, 
characterized in that the signal transmission and reception 

means (11-15) are fixed with respect to the plate (2) which 
carries them. 
The device as claimed in claim 6, characterized in 
that the control mean (9, 10) pivots the plate (2) about at 

least one axis (5, 7) perpendicular to the plane passing 
through the two signal transmission means, the plate (2) 

being mounted in an articulated way on a support (4). 
The device as claimed in any of claims 5 to 7, 
including more than two signal transmission and reception 

means, characterized in that the transmission mean (11) 
transmitting the reference signal is situated at an equal 

distance from all the other transmission means (12, 13, 14, 
15). 
The device as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 8, 
intended for contactless checking of components,  

 
characterized in that the transmission and reception means 

(11-15) of the signal are ultrasonic sensors. 
The device as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 8, 
characterized in that the mean of controlling the pivoting 

of the plate is a motor (9, 10) carried by the 
support-plate assembly (4, 2). 
The device as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 
10, characterized in that the means of detecting the offset 

in the journey times of the signals consists of an 
ultrasonic apparatus (18). 
The device as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 
11, characterized in that the mean invoking the mean of 

controlling (9, 10) the plate consists of a signal sent by 
the ultrasonic apparatus (18) to said check means.
