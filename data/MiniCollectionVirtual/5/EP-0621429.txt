<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sealing element for 
forming a liquid-tight seal between two tubular elements (1,11) 

running essentially parallel. The sealing element consists 
of positioning means which are in the form of a flange (2) 

which is fixed to the inner element of the tubular elements 
and which is provided on its periphery with a groove (4) which 

accommodates, in a slightly wedged fit, an endless element (3) 
of flexible material sealing the groove. On the inside of 

the groove one or more supply apertures for a compressed 
medium are present. When the compressed medium is supplied, 

the endless element of flexible material is moved outwards 
against the outer element of the tubular elements, in order 

to form a liquid-tight seal between the two columns. 
The element can be manufactured simply and cheaply 
from commercially available materials. The element is also 

easy to remove from the positioning means and replace. 
If water is used as the compressed medium, in the 
event of leakages, no damage is caused to the products. 
The sealing element according to the invention can 
be used in a curd drainage apparatus for removing whey in 

cheesemaking. 
The invention also relates to a device for removing 
whey from a whey/curd mass, provided with at least one 

sealing element according to the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a whey draining apparatus for
draining whey from a whey/curd mass, said apparatus
comprising at least one column including an inner tubular
element disposed in an outer tubular element and at least one
sealing element for forming a liquid-tight seal between the
two tubular elements, said sealing element at least
comprising an endless element of flexible material which
interacts with one of the tubular elements and of which at
least a part of the periphery can be moved in such a way
under the influence of a pressure medium that it rests
against the other tubular element and provides a seal,
wherein said endless element of flexible material is
connected to positioning means fixed to the inner
tubular element.Such a whey draining apparatus is known from practice.In the preparation of cheese, a whey/curd mass produced
following the addition of enzymes and a starter (bacterial
culture of lactic acid) to milk is guided through a drainage
apparatus, in order to remove whey from the mass. Such an
apparatus comprises one or more moulding pipes which are made
up of an inner and an outer column. The space between these
columns is divided by partitions into several chambers which
are separated from each other by means of sealing elements.
The chambers thus formed, called counterpressure chambers,
are connected to riser pipes for removing whey from the
whey/curd mass. These counter pressure chambers combined with
the riser pipes regulate the removal of whey by building up a
counter pressure.In the known apparatus such a sealing element is
situated on the inside wall of the outer column. The
positioning means comprise a flange which is provided on its
inner periphery with a groove. An inflatable rubber band or
hose is placed in the groove. The band, which has a special
profile and a special shape, is situated in a press fit in
the groove of the flange. The flange is provided with a
supply pipe for a pressure medium, in particular air. 
This supply pipe is permanently fixed to the rubber band. The
band can be inflated by supplying the medium through this
pipe. When the band is inflated, it expands and moves
slightly out of the groove, thereby coming into contact with
a flange placed on the inner column, in order to form a
liquid-tight seal between the two columns.The band or hose must have a special profile and a
special shape, because while is it being inflated only the
inner periphery of the band can move. The outer periphery is
held in place by the groove of the flange.The special shape and
