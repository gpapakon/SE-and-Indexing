<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a video signal recording
apparatus for recording video signals and its reproducing
apparatus and more particularly, to a video signal recording
apparatus and reproducing apparatus capable of obtaining a
picture having high picture quality in such a high speed
reproduction that is made at a speed as high as n times the
normal speed and suppressing a degradation in picture
quality even if erroneous in case that a coded signal coded
by MPEG (Moving Picture Coding Expert Group) or such an
intra-/inter-picture adaptively coded digital video signal
that is in use for ATV (Advanced Television) which is now
under consideration in America was digitally recorded in VCR
(Video Cassette Recorder).Such a video signal recording apparatus has been
conventionally proposed that when recording a video signal 
on a recording medium, by recording newly formed data for
the high speed reproduction use into a sub-code area which
is a position corresponding to a trace pattern of a head
when reproducing at high speed, the picture quality in high
speed reproduction can be improved (refer to Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application No. 2-94071).With the conventional apparatus, it is presupposed that
an input video signal is subjected to coding so as to be
entirely finished on an intra-picture basis and yet, the
amount of thus coded data is constant for each picture.With the conventional apparatus, however, such a
problem has been arisen that an improvement is limited to a
picture that is to be reproduced at a speed of two times the
normal speed.With the conventional apparatus, in addition, there
arises such a problem that it cannot be applied for a case
that the input video signal is coded by inter-picture coding
or it is. not coded with a fixed length code for each
picture. As a result, intra-/inter-picture adaptively coded
input video signal data, as with MPEG or ATV, does not have
a constant data amount for each picture and the inter-picture
coded part thereof cannot be directly decoded, so 
that the input video signal cannot be recorded.Besides, when considering upon a fact that valiable-length
data for the high speed reproduction use is recorded
into the sub-code area, it is necessary to ensure a range
where the maximum value is considered, thus arising such a
problem that unnecessary range may occur.Also, an error correction code generally uses a product
code that performs correction in a track unit. As a result,
if the reproduction is made so that the head obliquely
traverses recording tracks during
