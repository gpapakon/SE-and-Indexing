<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a conveyer device using a plurality of motor-incorporated 
rollers. The conveyer device related to the invention 

provides advantageous structure in that motor-incorporated rollers 
are highly interchangeable and practically usable with very high 

supply voltages. Each pair of the motor-incorporated rollers for 
composing the conveyer device are connected in series to each other. 

Each motor built in the motor-incorporated roller is based on star 
connection as per 200VAC of rated voltage. Interphase impedance of 

each motor built in the roller is 700Ω against supply power. The 
conveyer device itself uses 400VAC of power source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conveyer device, more 
particularly, to a conveyer device using a plurality of rollers each 
incorporating an AC-motor as drive source. In addition, the invention 
also relates to structure of the connection of rollers each incorporating 
a drive motor. Pulleys of any conventional belt-conveyer unit and rollers 
of any conventional roller-conveyer unit are respectively driven by a 
plurality of motors secured to frames. However, in response to industrial 
demand for easier assembly work and minimizing cubic space 
occupied by conveyer installations, recently, a greater number of 
drive pulleys and drive rollers each incorporating an AC-motor have been 
introduced. The term "roller incorporating a motor" designates such a 
roller internally being equipped with a drive motor which rotatably 
drives the roller itself such as the one typically disclosed in the 
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No, SHO63-235207 
(1988) and the Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No. 
HEI4-243720 (1992) for example. Taking a conventional roller conveyer for example, a plurality  
 
of rollers each incorporating a motor are secured to frames as 
basic structure of such a conventional conveyer unit using plural 
rollers incorporating motors. Those motor-incorporated rollers used for any conventional 
roller conveyer by way of being secured to frames respectively incorporate 
motors each having rated voltage exactly matching supply 
voltage conventionally being available. Those motor-incorporated rollers used for such a conventional 
roller conveyer respectively incorporate a motor having connection 
to the power source in parallel. In terms of supply voltage, normally, 200VAC is commercially 
available for three-phase alternating current in Japan. Nevertheless, 
in some cases, 400VAC is also introduced as factory power-source. 
On the other hand, not only 400VAC, but, in many cases, 
more than 400VAC of supply voltages are also conventionally used in 
the U.S.A. and European countries. In other words, there are a wide 
variety of motor-incorporated rollers using a variety of rated voltages 
in the world. In consequence, in spite of identical diameter 
and length, many of those conventional motor-incorporated rollers 
are devoid of interchangeability. As a result, users and dealers of conveyer units are obliged 
to constantly hold a wide variety of motor-incorporated rollers to 
prepare for repairing those conveyer units. Furthermore, such a conventional conveyer
