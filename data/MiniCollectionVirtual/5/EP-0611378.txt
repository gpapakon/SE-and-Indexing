<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing
polyethylenes having a broad molecular weight
distribution. More particularly, it is concerned with a
continuous process for preparing polyethylene of varying
polydispersities by combining an aluminoxane with a
chromium compound and varying the ratio of these metal
components.In general, polyolefins used for obtaining molded or
formed articles such as bottles, cable conduits and
ultrathin films are required to fully withstand molding
or forming conditions in plastisized state and be formed
into desired shapes easily. This requirement may be
satisfied by the use of a polyolefin having an increased
melt index (a lowered average molecular weight). Such a
polyolefin, however, can only afford a product inferior
in strength, e.g. impact resistance and tensile strength.
On the other hand, a polyolefin having a low melt index
affords a product superior in strength, which product,
however, is inferior in moldability. It is known that
this problem can be solved by using a polyolefin having a
broad molecular weight distribution.Moreover, physical properties required for polyethylenes
have been diversified recently, and also from the
standpoint of resources saving there is a tendency to
using polymer resin in an amount as small as possible in
a range not impairing physical properties. For example,
as to bottles and films, there is now a tendency to make
them as thin as possible while maintaining their
strength. A polyethylene which even in a small amount
exhibits good processability and high impact strength, 
tensile strength and resistance to environmental stress
cracking is keenly desired. Ziegler-Natta and chromium
based systems comprise the two major classes of olefin
polymerization catalysts. Aluminoxanes, especially
methylaluminoxane, have recently found wide application,
in conjunction with Group IV and V metallocenes, as
components of Ziegler-type olefin polymerization
catalysts. (See, for example, numerous papers by
W. Kaminsky and J.C.W. Chien).In contrast, the use of aluminoxanes in conjunction with
chromium catalysts is limited. Catalysts produced from
aluminoxanes and chromium salts, usually alkanoates, and
an electron donating ligand such as hydrocarbyl
isonitriles, amines, or ethers (U.S. Patent No. 4,668,838
to Briggs), or carbon dioxide (U.S. Patent No. 4,777,315
to Levine) have been reported as ethylene trimerization
catalysts. Some polyethylene is also produced.In the late 1960's Manyik et al. disclosed polymerization
