<DESCRIPTION>
 INDOLE DERIVATIVES AS 5-HT1 -LIKE AGONISTSThe present invention relates to indole derivatives which act on 5- hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors.More particularly the present invention relates to 3,5-disubstituted indoles which are selective agonists at the "5-I-πγiike" subtype of the 5- hγdroxytryptamine receptor. Such ,,5-HT1-like" receptors are present in the carotid vascular bed and their activation causes vasoconstriction with a consequent reduction in carotid blood flow. Compounds which have "5-r-πγiike" agonist activity are therefore useful in the treatment of medical conditions which are thought to result from excessive dilation of the carotid bed such as migraine, cluster headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and headache associated with vascular disorders. Certain compounds of the present invention are also agonists at central 5-HT- receptors and are therefore useful for the treatment of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, obesity and drug abuse.The present invention provides compounds of the formula:-...(I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein R is phenyl, pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pγrimidinyl, pγrazinyl, furyl or thienyl, all of which may be optionally substituted by halo, Ct-C4 alkyl, 0,-04 alkoxy or a group of the formula:--X-R2 ; 

R1 is H, C Cβ alkyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyi, C3-C7 cycloalkenyl, C3- C6 alkenyl or C3-Cβ alkynyl, said alkyl group being optionally substituted by C3-C7 cycloalkyi, C3-C7 cycloalkyloxy, OH, C,- Cβ alkoxy, CONR3R*, SO2NR3R*, CORε, SORB, SO2Rε, CO2Rβ, aryl, aryloxy, aryI(C,-Cβ)alkoxy or heteroaryl, said alkenyl group being optionally substituted by aryl and said cycloalkyi group being optionally substituted by OH; the cycloalkyi and cycloalkenyl groups being optionally linked to the N-atom by a C,-C2 alkylene moiety;R2 is COR7, CO2R7, SOR7, SO2R7, CONR3R*, SO2NR3R*, NHCOR7, NHCONR^*, I\IHS02R7, HSOj R^*, OH or CIM;R3 and R4 are either each independently selected from H, C3- C7 cycloalkyi and Cl-Cβ alkyl, said alkyl group being optionally substituted by C3-C7 cycloalkyi or aryl, or R3 and R* taken together represent C3-Cβ alkylene optionally interrupted by 0, S(O)n, NH or NfC^C,, alkyl);Rs is C,-Ce alkyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyi, C3-C7 cycloalkyKC,- Cβ)alkylene, aryI(C.-Cβ)aIkylene, or aryl;R6 is C,-Cff alkyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyi or aryKC^C^alkylene;R7 is C,-Cβ alkyl;X is a direct link or Ct-C7 alkylene;m is 1 or 2; and
