<CLAIMS>
The use of a compound from the class of metal-free 
or metal-containing phthalocyanines, metal-free or 

metal-containing naphthalocynanines, nickel dithiolene 
complexes, aminium compounds of aromatic amines, methine 

dyes or azulenesquaric acid dyes which have their absorption 
maximum in the range from 600 to 1,200 nm and/or a 

fluorescence maximum in the range from 620 to 1,200 nm, 
as a marker for liquids. 
The use of a compound as claimed in claim 1, 
which comes from the class of metal-free or metal-containing 

naphthalocyanines or nickel dithiolene 
complexes. 
The use of a compound as claimed in claim 1, 
which comes from the class of metal-free or metal-containing 

naphthalocyanines. 
A method for detecting a marker in liquids, 
wherein the marker is detected from its fluorescence in 

the NIR spectral region. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
fluorescence is excited by means of a semiconductor laser 

or a semiconductor diode. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the 
fluorescence light is detected by means of a semiconductor 

detector. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein a semiconductor 
laser or a semiconductor diode having a wavelength 

of maximum emission in the spectral range from 
λ
max
-100 nm to λ
max
 +20 nm is used, where λ
max
 is the 
wavelength of the absorption maximum of the marker. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein a semiconductor  
 

laser or a semiconductor diode having a wave-length 
of maximum emission of from 620 to 1,200 nm is 

used. 
A detector for carrying out the method as claimed 
in claim 4, which comprises an NIR light source selected 

from a semiconductor laser and a semiconductor diode, one 
or more optical filters, an NIR polarizer and a photodetector 

selected from a silicon photodiode and a 
germanium photodiode and, if desired, optical fibers or 

optical fiber bundles.
