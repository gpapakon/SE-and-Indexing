<ABSTRACT>
In a method and an apparatus for manufacturing a blister pack (B) with an additional cardboard ply (K) (cardboard blister pack BK), a blister pack (B) is provided as an endless band having products sealed in cups (N). At a combining station (11), an additional cardboard ply (K), which has recesses for the cups (N) of the blister pack (B) and which has essentially the length of a cardboard blister pack (BK) in the conveying direction of the blister pack, is laid true to dimension onto the blister-pack band, the recesses of the additional cardboard ply engaging over the cups of the blister pack. By means of a feed pawl (10), holding tongs (9) and draw-off rollers (15), the blister-pack band is fed in steps to the combining station (11) and, after the additional cardboard ply has been laid onto it, is displaced further in steps. In a sealing station (12), the additional cardboard ply is sealed together with the blister-pack band. Subsequently, in a cutting station (16), individual cardboard blister packs are cut off from the cardboard blister pack band.
