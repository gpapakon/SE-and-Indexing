<ABSTRACT>
An improvement on simplified fully automatic umbrella is disclosed. This 
umbrella comprises a shank consisting of an inner tube (11) and an outer tube 

(12), the inner tube has at upper section a middle ring (13) and an extension 
(14) while the outer tube has at upper end a lower ring (15) with an upper 

pawl (16); an umbrella opening spring (2) received within the extension; a 
cylinder (3) mounted around the extension and provided at lower end with an 

upper ring (31); an umbrella closing spring (4) mounted around the inner 
tube; an actuating mechanism consisting of a push button (51), an upper 

insert (52) containing a compression spring (521), a lower insert (53) 
containing a lower pawl (17), an actuator (533) and a detent (536), and a 

wire (54) interconnected between the two inserts; a canopy structure (6) 
connected to the upper, middle and lower rings; and a handle (7) provided 

at bottom of the outer tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a simplified fully automatic 
umbrella, particularly to an improvement on the actually mechanism 
of the automatic umbrella. European Pat. Application No. 92120933.4 filed by this same 
inventor disclosed a simplified fully automatic umbrella. Upon 
exploitation the present inventor found that the actuating mechanism 
and its operation can be further simplified and improved to reduce 
the probablities of malfunction. Thus, this invention is 
accomplished for this purposes. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide 
an improvement of actuating mechanism in the simplified fully 
automatic umbrella. This object is achieved by an automatic umbrella according to 
the present application which comprises a shank consisting of an 
inner and an outer tubes capable of relative sliding movement with 
respect to each other, in which said inner tube provided at upper 
section with a middle ring and an extension and formed along the 
length with upper, middle and lower lock holes, while said outer 
tube provided at upper end a lower ring with an upper pawl and 
formed with an upper slot and a lower lock hole; an umbrella 
opening spring telescopically received within said extension of said 
inner tube; a cylinder mounted around said extension for sliding 
movement relative thereto and provided at lower end with an upper 
ring; an umbrella closing spring telescopically mounted around said 
inner tube within the limits between said middle ring and the top 
end of said outer tube; an actuating mechanism consisting of a push 
button, an upper insert containing a compression spring, a lower 
insert containing a lower pawl, an actuator and a detent in 
interaction relationship, and a wire interconnected between said  
 
upper and lower inserts; a canopy structure connected with said upper, 
middle and lower rings corresponding in conventional manner; and a 
handle provided at lower end of said outer tube of the umbrella shank. The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the 
invention will be apparent from the following particular description 
of preferred embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the 
accompanying drawings. Fig.1 is an elevational cross section illustrating the 
automatic umbrella according to the invention in the closed state; Fig.2 is similar to Fig.1 provided illustrating the umbrella in 
the preparative state ready for opening; and Fig.3 is similar to Fig.1 provided illustrating the umbrella in 
the open state. Now, referring to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A fully automatic umbrella comprising, in combination: 
   a shank consisting of an inner tube and an outer tube 

capable of sliding movement relative to each other, in which said 
inner tube being provided at upper section with a middle ring and an 

extension outreached over said middle ring, and formed along the 
length with an upper hole, a middle hole and a lower hole as well as 

a lock hole, while said outer tube being provided at upper end with 
a lower ring having an upper pawl and formed with an upper slot and 

a lower aperture; 
   an umbrella opening spring telescopically received within 

said extension of said inner tube; 
   a cylinder mounted around said extension for sliding 

movement relative thereto and provided at lower end with an upper 
ring; 

   an umbrella closing spring telescopically mounted around 
said inner tube within the limits between said middle ring and the 

top end of said outer tube; 
   an actuating mechanism consisting of 

   a push button connected at inner side with an elastic 
press member; 

   an upper insert capable of pushing away said upper pawl 
engaged into said middle hole to release said umbrella 

opening spring; 
   an lower insert containing a lower pawl extended 

downwards at its free end; an actuator formed at inner side 
with first and second step and at outer side with a 

protrusion capable of locking into said lock hole; and a 
detent having a finger and a claw, said finger as well as 

the leading end of said actuator being extended into the 
field of said free end of said lower pawl at opposite sides, 

and said claw (538) being engaged into either said first step 
or said second step of said actuator (533) depending upon 

whether said umbrella being in closed or open status; and 
   a wire interconnected between said upper insert and said 

lower insert;
 

   a canopy structure connected via respective one end of 
constituting ribs with said upper, middle and lower rings 

correspondingly; and 
   a handle provided at bottom of said outer tube. 
An fully automatic umbrella according to claim 1, wherein 
said upper pawl is biased through said upper slot of said outer tube 

either to retain said umbrella opening spring in a compressed state, 
or into said upper hole of said inner tube to reinforce the 

stability of opened canopy structure. 
A fully automatic umbrella according to claim 1, wherein 
said lower pawl is biased by an expansion spring through said lower 

hole of said inner tube into said lower aperture to retain said 
umbrella closing spring in a compressed state. 
A fully automatic umbrella according to claim 2, where said 
pawl is pushed away said middle hole when said upper insert is 

driven upwards, so as to release said umbrella opening spring from 
its compressed state. 
A fully automatic umbrella according to claim 3, wherein 
said lower pawl is pivoted against said expansion spring as soon as 

its free end is pushed away by said actuator and retreated from said 
lower aperture of said outer tube, so as to release said umbrella 

closing spring from its compressed state. 
A fully automatic umbrella according to claim 1, wherein 
said lower insert is inclined at bottom for readily to be driven 

upwards by means of said push button.
