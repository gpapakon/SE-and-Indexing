<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a penetrating tool system. In such
a tool system, a penetrating tool is designed to penetrate a workpiece, for
example by piercing, boring, drilling, cutting, sawing, shearing, milling or
the like.Examples of such penetrating tool systems are cutting
machines of differing types such as saws, drills, sewing machines, planers,
shearing mechanisms or the like. These systems can be incorporated in
hand-held or portable tools or in fixed machine tools. With all such
known systems, there is imparted to the penetrating tool or to the
workpiece with respect to the tool, a basic displacement which can be
linear or rotational, and which can be uni-directional or reciprocating.
Thus, for example, a hand saw has imparted to it a reciprocating linear
basic displacement, and this is also the case with the needle of a sewing
machine.In most cases, however, with known penetrating tool systems,
the penetration of the tool into the workpiece involves a significant
energy consumption (and consequent heat generation) as well as in many
cases the generation of waste (possibly contaminating) material such as
sawdust or the like. Thus, for example, most hand-held power drills for
drilling in concrete or the like involve the use of a hammer
mechanism which, in addition to involving a high degree of energy
consumption, also includes relatively expensive components which
have to be frequently replaced.US 3,642,002, discloses a surgical tool having a drive
for establishing in the tool a basic reciprocating movement in
the form of short strokes. The tool is provided with a
counterweight in order to counterbalance vibrations caused by
such movement.EP-A-362019, discloses an apparatus for cutting and
punching a sheet material, such as cloth, along a specific
profile, which apparatus includes means for movement of a cutting
tool along the profile and for reciprocating the tool in the
direction normal to said movement.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
new and improved penetrating tool system wherein the above-referred-to
disadvantages and drawbacks are substantially reduced
and overcome.According to the present invention, there is provided
a penetrating tool system for penetrating a workpiece,
comprising:
a penetrating element;first means for imparting to said element a reciprocating
displacement having a frequency and amplitude which are
substantially invariant in time with respect to reactions of the
workpiece to penetration;second means for generating a force in said system so as
