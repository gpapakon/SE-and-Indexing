<ABSTRACT>
A magneto-optical head device includes a semiconductor 
laser (1), an objective lens system (3,4), a diffractive 

element (2), photodetectors (6,7), and an analyzer (8,9). 
The diffractive element (2) has diffraction efficiency 

dependent on a polarization direction of incident light. 
The photodetectors (6,7) receive the light reflected from a 

magneto-optical disk and diffracted at the diffractive 
element. The analyzer (8,9) splits at least a part of the 

diffracted light from the diffractive element into two 
polarized components orthogonal to each other. The diffractive 

element (2) has characteristics with which the 
polarized component in a predetermined direction in the 

incident light is partially diffracted and the polarized 
component orthogonal thereto is substantially totally 

diffracted. The diffractive element (2) is disposed such 
that the polarization direction of the light emitted from 

the semiconductor laser coincides with the predetermined 
direction, and the analyzer (8,9) are disposed such that 

the two polarized components split by the analyzer make an 
angle of about 45° with respect to the polarization direction 

of the light emitted from the semiconductor laser. 
The amounts of the main polarization component beams that  

 
reach the two photodetectors can be made substantially 

equal with each other and the common-mode noise elimination 
ratio during the differential detection operation can be 

raised. Also, the ratio of the magneto-optical signal 
component that reaches the photodetectors used for magneto-optical 

signal detection can be raised.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magneto-optical 
head device, and more particularly to a magneto-optical 
head device for recording, reproducing and erasing data on 
a magneto-optical disk. In recent years, for purposes of size and cost reduction 
of the magneto-optical head device, a research is 
being made for development of a structure utilizing a 
diffractive element whose diffraction efficiency is dependent 
on the direction of polarization of incident light. An example of a conventional magneto-optical head 
device using such diffractive element as above is shown in 
Fig. 1 (description of which is found, for example, in 
Japanese Patent Application Kokai Publication No. Hei 4-232633). 
In such conventional magneto-optical head device, 
the light emitted from a semiconductor laser 20 is transmitted 
through a polarizing diffraction grating whose 
diffraction efficiency is dependent on a polarization 
direction of incident light and, after being converted to 
parallel light by a collimator lens 14, is converged on a 
magneto-optical disk 12 by an objective lens 13. The  
 
reflected light from a magneto-optical disk 12 is again 
converted to the parallel light by the objective lens 13 
and, after being transmitted through the collimator lens 
14, is diffracted by the polarizing diffraction grating 15. 
The +1st order diffracted light and the -1st order diffracted 
light from the polarizing diffraction grating 15 
are received respectively by photodetectors 18 and 19 
equipped with analyzing function. The analyzing-function-equipped 
photodetectors 18 and 19 are constructed such that 
analyzers 16 and 17 which transmit only a predetermined 
polarized light component of the incident light are bonded 
respectively on photodetectors 21. The analyzers 16 and 17 
are disposed so as to allow the polarization directions of 
the transmitted light to be orthogonal to each other. 
Thus, the magneto-optical signal is detected from a difference 
between the outputs of the analyzing-function-equipped 
photodetectors 18 and 19. The photodetectors 21 used in 
the analyzing-function equipped photodetectors 18 and 19 
are divided respectively into three light receiving sections 
21a - 21c and 21d - 21f. Appropriate calculation of 
outputs from the light receiving sections enables detecting 
a focusing error signal and a tracking error signal. The polarizing diffraction grating 15 in the conventional 
magneto-optical head device described above has 
characteristics wherein the diffraction efficiency is dependent
