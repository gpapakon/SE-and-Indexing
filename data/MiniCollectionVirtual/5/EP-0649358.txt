<ABSTRACT>
A laser drilling process capable of producing a plurality of holes in a pharmaceutical dosage form, at high speed, is presented. The process utilizes a digital laser marking system (DIGIMARKTM variable marking system) (22) to produce an unlimited number of holes through the surface or coating of a dosage form (12), at rates up to 100,000 units or more per hour.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONHIGH SPEED PROCESS FOR PREPARING ORIFICES INPHARMACEUTICAL DOSAGE FORMSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThere is a need within the pharmaceutical industry to produce an opening in the surface of many types of dosage forms. For example, certain controlled release devices rely on an opening which extends from outside the device, through an outer coating or housing and into the core of the device, as a means of releasing material stored within the core to the environment of use.Often these controlled release devices rely on osmotic pressure, diffusion or surface hydration to deliver the contents of the core through the opening.U.S. Patent 4,088,864 reported the use of a laser to produce outlet passage-way in the walls of pills which dispense their contents osmotically. This technique comprised moving the pills in succession along a predetermined path at a predetermined velocity; tracking the moving pills seriatim with a laser of a wavelength which is absorbable by the walls. The laser beam dimensions at the wall, the laser power and the firing duration were such as to cause the laser beam to heat and pierce the wall and produce an outlet passageway 4 to 2000 microns in diameter through the wall and into the device core.There is further a need to produce dosage forms containing multiple holes through the dosage form and into the core of the dosage form. Application 07/815,304, filed December 28, 1991, for example, relies in part on multiple holes drilled through a water impermeable membrane. The holes expose multiple portions of the dosage form core to the environment of use, allowing for delivery of the drug stored within the core.Jain, N.K. and Naik S.U., J. Pharm Sci., 73, 1806-1811 (1984), have reported on the use of a laser to drill holes in capsules. To vary the number of pores, the capsule was mounted on a linear drive and moved at a speed of 2 mm/sec. By changing the laser frequency 

and keeping the power and pulse width constant 25 to 100 pores were drilled on the body of the capsule shell.Technology required to produce multiple patterns of openings through the dosage form shell or coating without repositioning of the dosage form has previously not been available. A process which provides for rapid through-put of dosage forms, capable of providing such a pattern of openings, without such manipulation is desirable.Recently, laser systems which employ a linear array of individual laser tubes have been developed. These systems allow the user to pulse only those lasers needed so as to

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A process for producing a dosage form having a plurality of apertures in its outside surface, using a digital laser marking system focused at a laser stage, the steps comprising:
(a) moving the dosage form into the laser stage of the digital laser marking system;
(b) pulsing the digital laser marking system to energize those laser tubes needed to drill the desired apertures along a linear array on the dosage form;
(c) moving the dosage form on the laser stage and pulsing the digital laser marking system to produce an additional linear array of apertures as required;
(d) removing the dosage form from the laser stage.
2. The process of Claim 1, wherein the apertures are arranged in the form of an m by n matrix to generate a desired pattern of apertures, where m and n range from 1 to about 1000.
3. The process of Claim 2, wherein the plurality of laser tubes can be energized individually or in parallel.
4. The process of Claim 3, wherein the dosage form is designed to deliver a chemical to an environment of use.
5. The process of Claim 4, wherein the dosage form is designed to deliver medicament to an animal.
6. The process of Claim 5, wherein the dosage form is designed to deliver medicament to a human.
7. The process of Claim 6, wherein the dosage form is selected from the group consisting of tablets, capsules, lozenges, boluses, pills, wafers, disks, expandable devices, patches, suppositories, 


collars, pellets, controlled release devices, slow release devices and other medicament delivery devices.
8. The process of Claim 7, wherein the dosage form is a core covered with a water insoluble and water impermeable coating.
9. The process of Claim 8, wherein the apertures are drilled through the film coating and terminate in the core of the dosage form.
10. The process of Claim 9, wherein the apertures extend completely through the dosage form.
