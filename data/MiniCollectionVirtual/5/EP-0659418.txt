<DESCRIPTION>
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a degenerative brain 
disorder characterized clinically by progressive loss of 
memory, cognition, reasoning, judgment and emotional 
stability that gradually leads to profound mental 
deterioration and ultimately death. AD is a common cause 
of progressive mental failure (dementia) in aged humans and 
is believed to represent the fourth most common medical 
cause of death in the United States. AD has been observed 
in varied races and ethnic groups worldwide and presents a 
major present and future public health problem. The 
disease is currently estimated to affect about two to three 
million individuals in the United States alone. To date, 
AD has proven to be incurable. The brains of individuals with AD exhibit 
neuronal degeneration and characteristic lesions variously 
referred to as amyloidogenic plaques, vascular amyloid 
angiopathy, and neurofibrillary tangles. Large numbers of 
these lesions, particularly amyloidogenic plaques and 
neurofibrillary tangles, are generally found in several 
areas of the human brain important for memory and cognitive 
function in patients with AD. Smaller numbers of these 
lesions in a more restricted anatomical distribution are 
found in the brains of most aged humans who do not have 
clinical AD. Amyloidogenic plaques and vascular amyloid 
angiopathy also characterize the brains of individuals with 
Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome) and Hereditary Cerebral 
Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of the Dutch-Type (HCHWA-D). 
At present, a definitive diagnosis of AD usually requires 
observing the aforementioned lesions in the brain tissue of 
patients who have died with the disease or, rarely, in 
small biopsied samples of brain tissue taken during an 
invasive neurosurgical procedure. Several lines of evidence indicate that 
progressive cerebral deposition of particular amyloidogenic  
 
proteins, β-amyloid proteins, (βAP), play a seminal role in 
the pathogenesis of AD and can precede cognitive symptoms 
by years or decades. See, Selkoe, (1991) Neuron 6:487. 
Recently, it has been shown that βAP is released from 
neuronal cells grown in culture and is present in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of both normal individuals and AD 
patients. See, Seubert et al., (1992) Nature 359:325-327. A possible correlation to the plaque pathology 
has been developed by several groups demonstrating the 
direct βAP neurotoxicity toward, cultured neurons. Direct 
neurotoxicity of βAP was recently reported to be attenuated 
by co-treatment with TGF-β (Chao et al., Soc.
