<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a process for treatment of waste 
water streams having a sodium sulfate content of above 20 

percent. The process is useful for treating waste water 
generated in the production of polyethyleneimine and 

cyclohexanone. The process includes the steps of removing sodium 
sulfate from waste water (10,12) by the addition of organic solvent (14). 

The waste water having reduced sodium sulfate content is then 
subjected to biological treatment with activated sludge. First 

the waste water is subjected to pre-treatment. Pre-treated waste 
water is combined other waste water and treated by 

denitrification and nitrification.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of waste water 
treatment. More specifically, the invention relates to a waste 
water treatment process including the removal of sodium sulfate 
from a waste water stream and biological treatment of waste 
water. Waste water resulting from the production of 
polyethyleneimine production and cyclohexanone production contain 
high concentrations of ammonia, organic carbon, oligomers and 
sodium sulfate and are unusually resistant to two sludge waste 
water treatment processes. A two sludge treatment system 
includes a denitrification step and a nitrification step. 
Denitrification removes carbon from waste water with the use of 
carbon metabolizing bacteria. Nitrification is the removal of 
ammonia from the waste water by bacterial oxidation of ammonia to 
nitrate (NO3-). Nitrification is carried out by a limited number 
of bacterial species and under restricted conditions, including a 
narrow range of pH and temperature. Nitrifying bacteria grow 
slowly and nitrogen oxidation is energy poor in relation to 
carbon oxidation. In addition, nitrification is inhibited by the 
presence of a large number of compounds, including ammonia and 
nitrite ion (NO2-). Also, nitrifying bacteria subsist only under 
aerobic conditions and require inorganic carbon (CO3-) for 
growth. The nitrification process met with recurring failure. 
Failure is exhibited by the change from nearly complete ammonia 
removal where no polyethyleneimine waste is present in the waste 
water, to essentially no ammonia removal, where 6 percent 
polyethyleneimine waste is present in the waste water, within a 
period of 48 hours.  
 The present invention is identification of the factors 
causing the failure of the polyethyleneimine waste water 
treatment process and development of a process to treat the waste 
water. It was found that biological pre-treatment of the 
polyethyleneimine waste stream, in order to reduce the inhibitory 
effect of the polyethyleneimine waste water on the nitrification 
process, is not feasible since the high content of sodium sulfate 
in the stream prevents biological activity. To solve this problem a waste water treatment process 
including removal of sodium sulfate from the waste water in 
conjunction with biological pre-treatment, denitrification and 
nitrification was devised. The present invention is a process for treatment of waste 
water streams generated from production of polyethyleneimine and 
cyclohexanone, including the steps of removing sodium sulfate 
from
