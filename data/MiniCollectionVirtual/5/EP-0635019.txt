<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to novel opiate derivatives which are synthesized for the covalent attachment to antigens (proteins or polypeptides) for the preparation of antibodies or receptors to the opiates and opiate metabolites. The resulting novel antigens may be used for the production of antibodies or receptors using standard methods. Once generated, the antibodies or receptors and the novel derivatives which are covalently attached to proteins, polypeptides or labels may be used in the immunoassay process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of ligand receptor
assays, including immunoassays, for the detection of
selected metabolites of opiates in a fluid sample. More
particularly, this invention relates to methods for the
synthesis of novel opiate derivatives and protein and
polypeptide opiate derivative conjugates and labels for
use in the preparation of antibodies to opiates and opiate
metabolites and for use in the immunoassay process.Opiates are a class of alkaloids produced by plants
of the poppy family. The most common opiates produced by
the poppy plants are morphine and codeine. These opiates
have been used for centuries to prevent pain but their
continual use leads to addiction. Synthetic analogues of
morphine also exhibit the narcotic and addictive properties
of the natural opiates and include heroin (diacetyl-morphine),
hydromorphone, hydrocodone, levorphanol, oxycodone
and oxymorphone. The illicit use of opiates, particularly
heroin and morphine, has resulted in a medical
need for antibodies and diagnostics to rapidly detect the
opiate metabolites in order to monitor and treat opiate
addiction.The preparation of antibodies to the class of opiates
and opiate metabolites requires the synthesis of an opiate
derivative in order to covalently attach the derivative to
an antigenic polypeptide or protein. In addition, the
opiate derivative is covalently attached to various polypeptides,
proteins or labels for use in screening antibodies
and in the immunoassay process. The opiate derivative
should mimic the structure of the opiate metabolite 
sought to be measured. Therefore, the selection and synthesis
of the types of opiate derivatives for covalent
attachment to proteins, polypeptides or labels is critical.
In addition, the opiate derivatives need to be
stable to hydrolysis in an aqueous solution.Opiate compounds and conjugates for immunization and
immunoassay have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos.

in Science 176, 1143 (1972), and Science 178, 647 (1972).The present invention is directed to novel opiate
derivatives which are synthesized for the covalent attachment
to antigens (proteins or polypeptides) for the preparation
of antibodies to the opiates and opiate metabolites.
The resulting novel antigens may be used for the
production of antibodies using standard methods. Once
generated, the antibodies and the novel derivatives which
are covalently attached to proteins, polypeptides or
labels may be used in the immunoassay process.In accordance with
