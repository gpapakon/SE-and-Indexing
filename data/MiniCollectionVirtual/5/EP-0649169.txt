<ABSTRACT>
A process for selectively etching a substrate (20) having a 
molybdenum disilicide layer (25) with a resist material 

(26) on portions of the molybdenum silicide layer (25) is 
described. The substrate (20) is placed into an etch zone 

and a process gas comprising SF
6
 and HBr is introduced into 
the etch zone. Preferably, the volumetric flow ratio of 

SF
6
:HBr is from about 1:10 to about 1:1, and more 
preferably, an oxygen containing gas such as O
2
 is added to 
the process gas. A plasma is generated in the etch zone to 

form an etch gas from the process gas that anisotropically 
etches the MoSi
x
 layer (25) with good selectivity and 
reduced profile microloading.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for etching molybdenum 
silicide in semiconductor processing. Reactive ion etching processes are used to fabricate devices 
having submicron sized features, such as semiconductor integrated circuit chips. 
These processes are used to selectively etch a substrate, where portions of the 
substrate are protected by a patterned etch resistant "resist" material, such as 
photoresist or oxide hardmask. The resist protected portions form "features" on 
the substrate which become part of the integrated circuit being processed. 
Etching is effected by introducing a process gas into a chamber and generating a 
plasma in the chamber to create an etch gas from the process gas. The etch 
gas etches the substrate to create volatile etch byproduct compounds, which 
are then removed from the chamber. Typically, the process gas is a mixture of gases such as for 
example a mixture of Cl₂ or CCl₄, O₂, and an inert gas such as He or Ar. Often a 
chloroflurocarbon gas is added to the process gas. However, there are several 
problems with these process gases. One problem is that chloroflurocarbon 
gases are environmentally toxic. Thus, processes using these gases are subject 
to strict environmental regulations. Another problem is that these gases chemically react with the 
resist on the substrate, and cause relatively thick residues or deposits to form on 
(i) the chamber walls, (ii) the sidewalls of the etched features, and (iii) the resist 
material. This deposit or residue layer can flake off and form particles that  
 
contaminate the wafers. The contaminant particles are not detected until the 
wafer is fully processed and can results in loss of the entire wafer at a cost of 
$5,000 or more. Another problem with these gases is that they etch features 
having "reentrant" profiles. By reentrant profiles, it is meant that the sidewalls 
of the features are inwardly sloped, forming angles of less than 85° with the 
substrate. Reentrant profiles are caused by isotropic etching or undercutting, 
which occurs when etching proceeds horizontally below the resist layer, instead 
of vertically through the uncoated portions. It is preferable to have features 
having vertical sidewalls with angles close to 90°, which occur when the 
process gas anisotropically etches the substrate and etching proceeds vertically 
through the uncoated portions of the substrate. Typical reactive ion etching systems can also result in high profile 
microloading. High profile microloading occurs when the
