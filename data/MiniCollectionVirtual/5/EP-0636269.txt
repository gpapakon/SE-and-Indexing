<ABSTRACT>
The universal data storage element presents a uniform form factor exterior housing and enables the user to vary the contents among a variety of media types, data storage and/or recording characteristics. These types and characteristics are identified by an apparatus inserted in a recess located on the exterior housing. The front side of this apparatus includes a plurality of coding apertures arranged in a linear array and placed as a function of the type of media or characteristics of the media. One of the apertures is manually definable by a slide mechanism to enable a user to set the write protect status of the media.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data storage systems 
and, in particular, to a data storage element form 
factor that can contain media of variable type and 
configuration, which media is identified by the use 
of a plurality of apertures imprinted on the 
exterior of the data storage element housing. A problem exists in data processing systems in 
that most data storage systems (recording media and 
hardware) fail to provide data storage capacity 
that is adaptable to the varying needs of the 
computer system. Existing data storage systems are 
inflexible, based on a single type of media that 
has predetermined mechanical, electrical, and 
operational constraints. A computer system user 
must therefore purchase a mixture of data storage 
systems to match the data storage capabilities with 
the nature of the data stored thereon. The 
selection of a data storage system also forces the 
user to restrict the media to a type that matches 
the installed data storage system. Often, the cost 
of additional incompatible data storage systems is 
prohibitive. The transition from one media to 
another is generally controlled by the need to 
change one of the primary data storage system 
characteristics such as volumetric efficiency of 
data stored per unit of space occupied, access  
 
performance (e.g. load, search, transfer times, 
etc.), cost, reliability, archival data storage 
capabilities (e.g. shelf life, environmental 
hardness, format standards, etc.), or management 
(e.g. media interchange, automated handling, 
catalogue systems, physical facilities, etc.). For removable media types, the effects of such 
transitions are exacerbated by the use of large 
automated library systems. An example of these 
automated library systems is the 4400 Automated 
Cartridge System manufactured by Storage Technology 
Corporation, which provides economical and 
efficient handling of thousands of the industry 
standard 3480-type magnetic tape cartridges for an 
associated plurality of tape cartridge drive 
systems. An automated library system requires the 
user to commit to a significant investment in 3480-type 
tape cartridges and tape drives. The robotic 
media handling elements in an automated library 
system typically can not handle diverse types of 
media, since such robots are designed to handle a 
specific media having a specific form factor. 
Furthermore if it were possible to introduce 
different media of similar form factor, media 
management requires a way to identify and 
differentiate individual media units. Thus,

<CLAIMS>
A data storage cartridge (100) that 
comprises a substantially rectangular housing (101) 

for enclosing a data storage media (103), wherein 
said housing (101) includes a recess (302) of 

predefined dimensions in one exterior surface 
thereon, said data storage cartridge (100) capable 

of being inserted into a unit for reading writing 

data on said data storage media (103), and capable of 
identifying said data storage media (103), being 

CHARACTERIZED BY: 

means (301), insertable into said recess 
(302) , for providing a plurality of coding 

apertures (300); and 
means (111), sandwiched between said 
providing means (301) and said housing (101) and 

slidable with respect to said providing means 
(301), for defining at least one (333) of said 

coding apertures (300), including: 

a first projection (323) for 
blocking said at least one aperture (333) 

when said defining means (111) is in a 
first position; and 
a second projection (324), 
accessible via an access slot in said 

providing means (301), for enabling a 
user to slide said defining means (111) 

into said first position to thereby 
manually define at least one (333) of 

said coding apertures (104). 
The cartridge of claim 1 wherein said 
providing means (301) includes:
 
   a block (301) of exterior dimensions 

substantially the same as said predefined 
dimensions of said recess (302) and including a  

 
recess on one side thereof to enclose at least a 

part of said defining means (111) between said 
providing means (301) and said housing (101). 
The cartridge of claim 1 wherein said 
providing means (301) includes:
 
   color coding, substantially surrounding 

said plurality of coding apertures (300). 
The cartridge of claim 1 wherein said 
coding apertures (331, 332, 333) are substantially 

rectangular in shape. 
The cartridge of claim 1 wherein said 
plurality of coding apertures (300) are aligned in 

a linear array on one surface of said providing 
means (301). 
The cartridge of claim 1 wherein said 
defining means (111) includes:
 
   indicator means (325) alignable with a 

corresponding indication (326) on said housing 
(101) to denote in human readable form the state of 

said at least one aperture (333). 
The cartridge of claim 1 wherein said 
data storage cartridge (100) includes an opening 

(102) in one corner thereof for accessing said data 
storage media (103), said recess (302) being 

5 located proximate said opening (102) and on the 
same side of said housing (101) as said opening 

(102). 
The cartridge of claim 7 wherein said at 
least one aperture (333) defines a write protect 

state of said data storage media (103), said 
defining means (111) includes:
  
 

   human readable indicator means (325) 
alignable with a corresponding human readable 

indication (326) on said housing (101) to denote 
said write protect state of said data storage media
