<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF DETECTING TUMORS CONTAINING COMPLEXES OF P53AND HSP70 This invention was made with Government support under NCI Grant 1 F32 CA08899-01. The Government has certain rights to this invention.Related Applications5 This application is a continuation-in-part of copending application Serial Number 07/869,292, filed 14 April 1992, the disclosure of which is to be incorporated herein by reference.Field ofthe Invention 10 The present invention relates to the finding that the class of mutant p53 proteins which bind to HSP70 defines a group of mutant p53 proteins which elicit serum autoantibodies.Background ofthe Invention15 Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are* found at a high frequency in a wide variety of primary ^ human cancers. See, e.g., M. Hollstein et al., Science* 253, 49-53 (1991). Breast cancer is typical of human carcinomas with respect to p53 involvement, and it has20 been reported that approximately 10% of breast cancer patients have circulating antibodies directed against the 

p53 protein. L. Crawford et al. , Int. J. Cancer 30, 403-408 (1982) . The diagnostic significance of circulating p53 antibodies has, however, been uncertain: it has subsequently been found that 21% of patients with benign mammary fibroadenomas show elevated levels of the p53 protein in tumor tissue samples, and that more than half of patients with serum p53 antibodies show no elevation of the p53 protein in tumor tissue. L. Crawford et al.f Î›fol. Biol . Med. 2, 261-272 (1984).Summaryofthe InventionIn the study leading to the present invention, p53 immunogenicity was examined in breast cancer patients with particular regard to the type of p53 mutant being expressed by tumor cells and the ability of these proteins to bind the 70 kd heat shock protein. As discussed in detail below, we have now found that the class of mutant p53 proteins which bind to HSP70 defines a group of mutant p53 proteins which elicit serum autoantibodies. Because p53 proteins which bind HSP70 tend to be more tumorigenic, see P. Hinds et al., Cell Growth Differ. 1, 571-580 (1990); 0. Halevy et al., Science 250, 113-116 (1990), this finding provides a way to use serum p53 auto antibodies for the diagnosis and prognosis of disease. In view of the foregoing, a first aspect of the present invention is a method of classifying tumor cells for the ability to produce serum p53 autoantibodies in a patient carrying such tumor cells. The method comprises collecting a sample of tumor cells from the patient, and then detecting (e.g., by
