<ABSTRACT>
Two equiangular beams are formed by one antenna plane, and a plurality of planes are combined to generate 

multiple beams. It becomes possible in this way to make the apparatus compact in size and to reduce the wind pressure 
against the antenna receives. Accordingly, a greater number of antennas can be mounted to one support structure, and 

the weight of the support structure can be substantially reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is utilized for antenna devices in fixed or mobile radio
communication systems. It relates in particular to multibeam antenna devices which
can generate a plurality of beams by means of a single antenna.A method hitherto used in the field of mobile radio communications to increase
channel capacity is to divide a single zone into a plurality of sector zones. An
example of this sort is shown in Figure 1. In this example, service zone 20 is divided
into a plurality of sector zones 21.1, 21.2, .... Multibeam antenna device 23 capable
of generating a plurality of beams is provided at base station 22 in service zone 20,
and main beams 24.1, 24.2, ... of this multibeam antenna device 23 are directed at
sector zones 21.1, 21.2, ..., respectively.A plurality of antennas with narrowed 3 dB beamwidth in the horizontal plane
is used as multibeam antenna device 23. Specific examples of the prior art are
illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Figure 2 is a perspective view and Figure 3 is
a sectional view. A plurality of array antennas is used in this prior art, and these are
arranged so that each antenna face forms one side of a polygon. That is to say, a
plurality of array antennas is formed by arraying a plurality of radiators 31 in each of
antenna faces 30.1―30.4, and these array antennas are arranged so that each forms
one side of a polygon (in this example, so that four sides of a hexagon are formed by
four faces). This results in antenna faces 30.1―30.4 facing directions which differ
by 60° from one face to the next, and in main beams 32.1―32.4 being obtained in
these respective directions. The 3dB beamwidths of main beams 32.1―32.4 are set
at 60°. Planar radiators or dipole antennas fitted with reflectors are used as radiators
31.Figure 4 shows an arrangement for obtaining a beam with any given 3dB
beamwidth. Power divider 42 gives equal-amplitude, equal-phase power to two
radiators 41.1 and 41.2 arranged side by side horizontally in antenna face 40. A beam
of any desired 3dB beamwidth can then be formed by adjusting the spacing d of
radiators 41.1 and 41.2. A multibeam antenna device can be constructed by arraying
such radiator pairs in one face and then combining a plurality of faces. In the prior
art examples shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3, radiator pairs which have been set to
give 3dB beamwidths of 60° are arranged in four faces, and four beams are formed. Figure 5 and Figure 6 show, in similar fashion to Figure 2 and Figure 3, an
arrangement wherein six beams are formed using six antenna
