Apparatus includes an infrared laser source (22), a polarized frequency shifter (24) which produces a polarized-modulated infrared laser beam, a piezoelectric transducer (26) for driving the polarizing frequency shifter (24), and an optical transducer (30) with a glucose measuring head (32).

The probe beam, after passing through the finger, is converted into a probe electrical signal, the reference beam is converted into a reference electrical signal, the probe and reference electrical signals are compared, and the obtained phase difference is processed by an electronic signal processing unit (34) which presents the results in the form of blood glucose concentration. Alternate embodiments based on measurement of circular dichroism caused by the presence of glucose in blood are included. The polarized frequency shifter may be crystal optic or fiber-optic based.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NON-INVASIVE BLOOD GLUCOSE MEASUREMENTField of the InventionThe present invention relates to measuring the concentration of glucose, more particularly to the non-invasive, phase-sensitive measurement of the glucose concentration in blood.Background of the InventionAs of 1992, more than ten million people in the United States of America suffer from diabetes (an increased level of glucose in the blood) and hypoglyce ia (a reduced level of glucose in the blood) . Individuals afflicted with either disease in a severe form typically perform an invasive blood glucose level analysis four or more times a day. Invasive techniques require withdrawal of a blood sample from the patient each time an analysis is to be performed. An accurate laboratory blood analysis requires withdrawing from 5 to 10 ml of blood and analyzing it using a laboratory instrument designed for performing such a biochemical analysis. However, the results of the test often are not available for several hours, and sometimes days. In addition, the instruments necessary to perform such an analysis are expensive and require that the blood samples be taken and analyzed by trained technicians. Another invasive technique, referred to as a "finger poke" or a "finger stick" uses an integrated, self-contained instrument that evaluates a much smaller blood sample (approximately 0.25 ml). The small blood sample is obtained by puncturing a finger with a small lancet. The sample is then placed on a chemically treated carrier and inserted 

 into the instrument. The finger poke devices normally provide the glucose concentration results in a few moments. However, they are still quite costly for private use, i.e., in the range of several thousand dollars. More recently, portable finger poke instruments have become available which require the use of single use, disposable, chemically treated carrier "strips." Although the portable instruments have a relatively low cost (about $100 to $300 U.S.D.), the cumulative cost to diabetics for the normal supply of disposable carrier "strips" is considerable.Invasive techniques for glucose analysis are problematic and suffer from poor patient compliance. Many people who would benefit from knowing their glucose concentration are reluctant to have blood withdrawn by a finger poke or a hypodermic needle or have a generalized fear of invasive medical procedures. Still others suffer anxiety in connection with the sampling and worry about the discomfort (pain) and possibility of infection. Another problem is that frequent
