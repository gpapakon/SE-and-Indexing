<ABSTRACT>
A toroidal carcass (1) for road vehicle tires, of 
the type presenting two annular beads (2, 3) connected 

by a toroidal reticulated structure (5) defined by two 
numbers of loops (6, 7) extending in offset radial 

planes of the carcass (1) and from the respective beads 
(2, 3) to the center line of the reticulated structure 

(5); the loops (6, 7) being formed by winding respective 
continuous cords (8, 9) about the beads (2, 3), and 

being connected by a further continuous cord (13) 
extending along the center line of the reticulated 

structure (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toroidal 
carcass for road vehicle tires. In particular, the present invention relates to a 
toroidal carcass of the type comprising two annular 
beads; and a toroidal reticulated structure connecting 
the beads and in turn comprising a number of elongated 
reinforcing elements extending in substantially radial 
planes in relation to the beads. A tire of this type, which discloses the features of the 
preamble of claim 1, is known e.g. from EP-A-0 549 869. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a carcass of the aforementioned type, wherein 
the reticulated structure may be formed cheaply and 
easily using continuous cords, i.e. cords which need not 
be precut for forming the reticulated structure. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a carcass of the aforementioned type, 
characterized by the fact that said elongated elements 
are defined by two numbers of loops extending in 
respective radial planes in relation to and from the 
beads, and forming part of respective turns of 
respective first continuous cords wound about the beads;  
 
a second continuous cord connecting the loops in said 
two numbers of loops. A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention 
will be described by way of example with reference to 
the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a schematic partial view in 
perspective of a preferred embodiment of the carcass 
according to the present invention; Figure 2 shows a partial plan view of the Figure 1 
carcass. Number 1 in Figure 1 indicates a toroidal carcass 
for a road vehicle tire. Carcass 1 comprises two annular beads 2 and 3 with 
respective fillers 4; and a toroidal reticulated 
structure 5 connecting beads 2 and 3, and in turn 
comprising a number of elongated reinforcing elements 
defined by two numbers of substantially U-shaped, 
substantially identical loops 6 and 7 extending from 
respective beads 2 and 3 to the center line of structure 
5, offset in relation to one another, and in 
substantially radial planes in relation to beads 2 and 
3. Each number of loops 6, 7 is formed from a 
respective continuous cord 8, 9 wound about respective 
bead 2, 3 to form a number of turns, each of which is 
drawn towards said center line of structure 5 to define 
a respective loop 6, 7 having two substantially parallel 
arms 10 and 11 connected by a curved portion 12.  
 Structure 5 is completed by a third continuous 
cord 13 extending along said center line and alternately 
engaging curved portions 12 of

<CLAIMS>
A toroidal carcass (1) for road vehicle tires, 
the carcass (1) being of the type comprising two annular 

beads (2, 3); and a toroidal reticulated structure (5) 
connecting the beads (2, 3) and comprising a 

number of elongated reinforcing elements extending in 
substantially radial planes in relation to the beads (2, 

3); characterized by the fact that said elongated 
elements are defined by two pluralities of loops (6, 7) 

extending in respective radial planes in relation to and 
from the beads (2, 3), and forming part of respective 

turns of respective first 
and second 

continuous cords (8, 9) wound 
about the beads (2, 3); and a third continuous cord (13) 

connecting the loops (6, 7) in said two numbers of loops 
(6, 7). 
A carcass as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that the radial planes of the loops (6, 7) 

in said two numbers of loops (6, 7) are offset in 
relation to one another. 
A carcass as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized by the fact that said first cords (8, 9) 

are so wound that the respective loops (6, 7) present 
substantially the same length and such that the second 

cord (13) extends along the center line of the 
reticulated structure (5). 
A carcass as claimed in any one of the 
foregoing Claims, characterized by the fact that each  

 
said loop (6)(7) presents two substantially parallel 

arms (10, 11) connected by a curved portion (12) engaged 
by said second cord (13); an end portion of each said 

loop (6)(7), adjacent to the respective curved portion 
(12), being twisted 180Â°.
