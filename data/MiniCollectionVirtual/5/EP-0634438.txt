<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymer composite
material reinforced by dispersion of a rigid polymer in a thermoplastic
polymer matrix at the molecular level and a method for
preparing said composite.Unique properties are generally established in a
polymer material due to its high-order structure. The high- order
structure is influenced by such a primary structure as molecular
weight, molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, orientation
and so on it particularly depends largely on its molecular structure.
Therefore, there have been proposed macro fiber reinforced composite
materials since the past so as to overcome the limit of
mechanical properties, which occur naturally.Examples of filament fibers having a high elastic
modulus and a high strength used in, a macro fiber reinforced
composite material include carbon fibers, glass fibers, aramide
fibers and so on. However, these fibers are usually aggregates of
fibril and micro fibril and thus contain defects at each place which
cause micro cracks. For example, the ends of molecular chains,
micro fibrils or fibers, which are propagation paths of destruction
cracks, are stressed higher than the average stress in the structure 
subjected to an external force, that causes concentration of
the stress. And since the diameter of the filament is about 10 µm,
an interface bonding between the fiber and the matrix must be
strong enough to distribute the external stress uniformly over
oriented fibers in the matrix and draw out a possible ultimate
property of the fiber .As for these problems of the structural defects of the
macro fiber and the interface bonding, the far-reaching effects of
the fatal defects can be reduced and the strength can be enhanced
by minuteness of the diameter. That is, the minuteness of the
diameter prevents the stress from concentrating at a local part
and increase its aspect ratio L/D (L and D are the length and the
diameter of the reinforcing fiber, respectively), thereby increasing
the contact area, with the result that the problem of the interface
bonding with the matrix molecule can be eliminated. Therefore, it
is a best mode to disperse the rigid polymer in the matrix, which
mode makes a critical aspect ratio easily achieved if the molecular
diameter of the rigid polymer is D, resulting in establishment of
the theoretical strength of the molecule if the interface bonding
between the fiber and the matrix is enough since rupture of the
composite material means rupture of the covalent bond of the
molecular chain in the composite
