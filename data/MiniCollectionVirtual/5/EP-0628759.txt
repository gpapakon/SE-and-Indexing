<ABSTRACT>
A guide ring (1) for centring a tube in a tube or passage has low friction runners (3) arranged along the outer face at a distance from each other. The runners (3) are connected to each other by a flexible, elastic and pref. recoverable part (4) which one or more length restrictors are attached. In a mfg. process runners (3) are attached to a continuous band (8) of elastic material forming a base. Alternatively plastic shells with integrally formed runners (3) are attached to the band (8). The runners (3) or shells with runners (21) are permanently attached to the base (8). The band (8) can be rolled up for storage. Ring (1) mfr. is effected by cutting off a length of the band (8) slightly shorter than the circumference of the pipe on which it is to be mounted. End connectors (7) are bonded or welded to the ends of the cut band (8), the ring (1) is wrapped around the pipe and the ends (7) connected together.
