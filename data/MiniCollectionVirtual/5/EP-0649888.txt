<ABSTRACT>
An ink composition for an ink jet recording is provided 
which has excellent various properties, particularly can 

realize printing with less bleeding. The ink composition 
comprises a dye, propylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether (PGmBE) 

and/or dipropylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether (DPGmBE) and a 
water-soluble glycol ether other than PGmBE and DPGmBE, the 

total amount of PGmBE and DPGmBE being 3 to 30% by weight 
based on the ink composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink composition for
ink jet recording.Various properties are required of ink compositions for
ink jet recording. For example, ink compositions for ink jet
recording should provide a print on various recording media
without bleeding. In order to prevent bleeding, various ink
compositions have hitherto been proposed in the art (for example,
Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 2907/1990, 15542/1989
and 3837/1990).Furthermore, a proposal has been made on the prevention
of bleeding through an improvement in penetration of an ink
composition. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,156,675 discloses
an ink composition containing diethylene glycol monobutyl
ether. U.S. Patent No. 5,183,502 discloses an ink composition
containing a surfactant. U.S. Patent No. 5,196,056 discloses
an ink composition containing diethylene glycol monobutyl
ether and a surfactant. Diethylene glycol monobutyl ether is
called "butylcarbitol" and disclosed in, for example, U.S.
Patent No. 3,291,580. U.S. Patent No. 2,083,372 discloses an
ink composition containing diethylene glycol ether.According to the above ink compositions, although
bleeding can be prevented to some extent, an ink composition,
which is less likely to cause bleeding, has been desired in
the art.In recent years, recycled paper has become used from
the viewpoint of environmental protection. The recycled paper
comprises components of various types of paper. Thus,
penetration of an ink composition into the recycled paper
varies from component to component, which results in bleeding
in the print. In order to prevent bleeding in the recycled
paper, a method has been proposed wherein recording paper is 
heated at the time of printing. In this method, however, a
certain period of time is required for the paper to be heated
to a predetermined temperature. Furthermore, power
consumption becomes high, which is not cost-effective.
Moreover, there is a fear of the recording paper and print
being deteriorated by heating.The ink composition for ink jet recording should
satisfy further property requirements including that it should
provide a good print density and a long intermittent printing
time and be stable and less likely to clogging of nozzles.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide an ink composition for ink jet recording which has
various excellent properties, especially an ink composition
for ink jet recording which can realize printing with less
bleeding.The ink composition for ink jet recording according to
the present
