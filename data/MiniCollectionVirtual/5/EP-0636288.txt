<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of logarithmic
amplifiers. More particularly, the present invention relates to a multi-stage
logarithmic amplifier, incorporating high performance, low power logarithmic
amplifier cells, providing accurate logarithmic intercept and slope response.Until recently, logarithmic amplifiers were practically unavailable which
are useful for both low frequency and high frequency applications, and which
are inherently free of sensitivity to temperature variations and production
tolerances of the devices comprising the active elements so as to provide high
accuracy log-law performance over a wide temperature range and in the
presence of large production variations.U.S. Patent No. 4,933,641 is directed to a logarithmic intermediate
frequency amplifier which has an extended dynamic range. The successive
detection technique is implemented in a modified form utilizing parallel
channels. The parallel channels are each comprised of successive identical
stages. One channel receives the input at full signal strength while the other
channel receives a signal which has been attenuated. As a result, the non-attenuated
channel includes more stages than the parallel connected attenuated
channel.U.S. Patent No. 5,057,717 is directed to a logarithmic amplifier circuit
operable with a low power supply voltage while having a wide dynamic range.
A first plurality, n, of differential amplifiers is connected in cascade and a
second plurality, n + 1, of rectifying circuits each connected to an input of
each stage and an output of a final stage of the differential amplifiers are set
forth. Accordingly, the outputs of the rectifying circuits are a combination of
hyperbolic characteristics and square-law full-wave rectifying characteristics.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,929,909 and 4,990,803 (hereafter referred to as
"the '909 patent" and "the '803 patent", respectively), assigned to the present
applicant, to which the reader's attention is directed, describe a logarithmic
amplifier which does not suffer from the above-noted limitations. FIG. I is a block diagram of the logarithmic amplifier disclosed in the
'803 patent. The amplifier includes a plurality of amplifier/limiter/detector
stages (hereinafter referred to as "gain" stages or "logarithmic amplifier gain
stages") 100-1 through 100-n, a gain bias generator 102, a scale bias
generator 104, and an offset generator 106, which are common to all gain
stages. All of the gain stages working together produce a logarithmic output
signal
