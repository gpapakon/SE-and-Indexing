Device for modifying the natural pressure 
distribution of a ski, such as especially an alpine ski, 

over its gliding surface, adapted to equip an assembly 
comprising a ski, front (3) and rear (4) binding elements 

adapted to retain the ends of a boot (2), at least one 
support element (8, 12) on which the sole of the boot rests,
 
   characterized by the fact that it comprises: 


a sensor element (12), provided to support a portion 
of the boot, the sensor element being movably mounted along 

a vertical direction, 
a front base plate (25, 45) and a rear base plate 
(13) provided to be fixedly assembled to the ski, 
a front compression bar (31, 61) and a rear 
compression bar (14) respectively connected to the front and 

rear base plates, 
a linkage tipping element (30) connected to the 
sensor and to the front and rear compression bars, 
the sensor being connected to the tipping element 
such that a vertical movement of the sensor causes a 

rotation of the tipping element, 
the compression bars being connected to the linkage 
tip
ping element such that the rotation of the tipping 
element resulting from a downward movement of the sensor 

causes a frontward and rearward movement of the ends of the 
front and rear compression bars, respectively. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the sensor is carried by one of the compression 

bars that is mounted to oscillate about an axis of rotation 
borne by a base plate. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the 
fact that the compression bar that carries the sensor is the 

rear compression bar.  
 
Device according to claim 2, characterized by the 
fact that the tipping element (30) has an L-shaped section, 

the end of horizontal arm (35) of which rests on a wedge 
(38) whose vertical arm (36) has, at each end of its 

vertical arm, a connection for the end of the front and rear 
compression bars. 
Device according to claim 4, characterized by the 
fact that the front compression bar (31) is connected to the 

upper end of the vertical arm (36) of the tipping element, 
and the rear compression bar (14) is connected to the lower 

end of the vertical arm (36) of the tipping element. 
Device according to claim 4, characterized by the 
fact that the wedge (38) on which the tipping element rests 

is affixed to the front end of the rear base plate (13). 
Device according to claim 6, characterized by the 
fact that the wedge (38) is provided to be affixed to the 

ski in front of the rear base plate (13), independently 
thereof. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the front base plate (25, 55, 53) has, at its 

upper surface, a mounting zone provided to receive the base 
(6) of the front binding element (3) and has, in addition, a 

raised rear end (27) to which the front compression bar is 
connected. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the front compression bar is connected to the 

front base plate by a second tipping element (52) journalled 
about a transverse axis, which has a free end engaged 

beneath the rear edge (54) of the base plate. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the rear compression bar (14) is a slide provided 

to receive the body (9) of a rear binding element (4).  
 
Device according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that one (61) of the compression bars is in two 

segments (62, 63) journalled between them in the central 
zone of the bar in the manner of a knuckle joint. 
Assembly of alpine ski front and rear binding 
elements, characterized by the fact that it further 

comprises a device according to any of the preceding claims. 
Alpine ski, characterized by the fact that it is 
equipped with a device according to any of the preceding 

claims.
