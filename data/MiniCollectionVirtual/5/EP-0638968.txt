<ABSTRACT>
Choke coils (5) are attached to the inner part (1) of a two-part end cap assembly by 
means of first and second leads (9 and 30). Contact means (10) attached to the outer 

part (6) of the assembly are provided with two slotted plugs which each have two legs. 
On insertion of each slotted plug in a respective slot formed in the external surface of 

the inner part (1) of the assembly, the two legs of the slotted plug engage opposite 
sides of a first lead (9) of one choke coil (5) extending transversely across the slot and 

bite the opposite sides so as to make good electrical and mechanical contact with the 
first lead. Both legs of each slotted plug are formed with retaining teeth for 

engagement with the end walls of the slot into which the slotted plug is inserted, to 
resist withdrawal of the slotted plug from the slot. This helps secure the inner and 

outer parts in axial engagement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an end cap assembly for a fractional horsepower PMDC 
electric motor and, in particular, to such an assembly fitted with at least one 
suppression element. It is common to provide electric motors with suppression elements to prevent or 
reduce electrical interference which, in automotive environments, may impair the 
functioning of on-board microprocessors. Typically, these elements take the form of a 
choke connected in series between a power supply terminal and a motor brush or a 
capacitor connected between a motor brush and earth or between two motor brushes. 
Diodes may also be used in more sophisticated suppression circuits. These 
suppression elements are conveniently mounted on the motor end cap. However, for 
smaller size electric motors, difficulty is often encountered in accommodating these 
suppression elements. One way to overcome this difficulty is to provide a two-part 
end cap and to accommodate the suppression elements between the two parts of the 
end cap. Thus, as disclosed in UK Patent Specification No GB -A- 2 222 316, it is known to provide an 
end cap assembly, for a fractional horsepower PMDC electric motor, comprising an 
inner part having internal and external surfaces; brush gear mounted on the internal 
surface of the inner part; a suppression element mounted on the external surface of the 
inner part in electrical contact with the brush gear; an outer part shaped for axial 
engagement with the inner part and formed with at least one terminal aperture; and a 
terminal extending through the aperture. In this case, the terminal is mounted in the inner part and the outer part serves as a 
protective cover for the suppression element. Separate means must therefore be 
provided for supporting the suppression element on the external surface of the inner 
part, for making a permanent connection between the suppression element and the 
brusli gear and for making a permanent connection between the terminal and the 
suppression element. This results in a complicated structure which, as a consequence, is relatively difficult 
and costly to produce.  
 The purpose of the present invention is to overcome or at least reduce these 
disadvantages and to provide a two-part end cap assembly of simpler construction 
which is easier and less costly to produce. This is achieved by providing an assembly in which the suppression element has at least 
one lead mounted on the external surface of the inner part; and contact means are 
attached to the terminal and engaged with
