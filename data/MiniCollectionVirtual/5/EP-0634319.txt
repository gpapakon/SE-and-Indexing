<ABSTRACT>
A crank device which can produce a large torque 
without increasing the locus of the crank arm. The crank 

arm (6) has first (7) and second arms (8) which are longitudinally 
slidably coupled together through a pinion (13). The second arm 

is formed with two sets of rack teeth (17,18) on both sides of the 
pinion. The pinion has along its circumference a plurality 

of teeth (19) which are adapted to alternately come into mesh 
with the respective sets of rack teeth every time the crank 

arm makes a half turn in the same direction. Thus, the 
entire length of the crank arm alternately becomes maximum 

and minimum every time the crank arm turns by 180Â°. By 
applying a driving force to the crank arm when the length 

of the crank arm is maximum, it is possible to produce a 
large torque.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a crank device for use in
the crank-pedal mechanism of a bicycle or for use as a
coupling member between a piston and the crankshaft of an
automotive engine.Fig. 4B shows a conventional crank device of this
type. It has a crank arm 111 having one end thereof
coupled to a rotary shaft 112. Driving force F is applied
to the other end of the arm 111.The arm 111 of this conventional crank device has a
fixed length L', so that it makes a completely circular
movement about the rotary shaft 112. Torque T is thus
produced at the rotary shaft 112.Let us now consider the crank-pedal mechanism of a
bicycle. Force is applied to the pedal only while the
pedal is moving down, i.e. only in a range about half the
full one rotation cycle. In the other half of the cycle,
the crank arm is rotated by inertia with no external force
being applied.Similarly, in case of an automotive engine, driving
force acts on the crank arm not throughout the entire range
of the rotation cycle of the crank arm but only while the
piston is being accelerated by the combustion of the air-fuel
mixture in the cylinder. At other times, the crank 
arm is rotated by inertia.In order to produce as large torque T as possible
with the conventional crank device shown in Fig. 4B, the
length L' of the crank arm 111 has to be correspondingly
large. But a long crank arm leads to increase in the size
of the entire crank device as well as its working space.If the crank-pedal mechanism of a bicycle has such
long crank arms 111, the rider will have a hard time
applying force on the pedals because the turning radius of
the pedals is very long and thus he has to move his feet
along a correspondingly large circular path. FR-A-2356550 discloses a crank device according to the pre-characterizing
part of the independent claims 1 or 5.It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved
crank device.This object is achieved by a crank device according to claim
1 or claim 5. The dependent claims are related to further advantageous
aspects of the present invention.It is one advantage of the present invention to provide a
crank device that can produce a maximum torque for a predetermined
force while keeping the locus of the crank arm to a
minimum. In an arrangement, the connection between the
motion converting means and the one arm is separable. The
crank device further comprises means for changing the
connecting position between the motion converting means and
the one arm.In a further arrangement, the motion converting
means
