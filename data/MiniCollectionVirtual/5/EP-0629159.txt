<ABSTRACT>
A conductor rail support, in particular for underground and tramways, has a holder made of plastic parts that interlockingly enclose a conductor rail arranged at a defined distance from a running rail. The conductor rail support and the running rail rest on sleepers. The holder itself is composed of at least two mutually interlocking profiles made of thermoplastic material, preferably glass-fiber-reinforced polyamide with the admixture of carbon black. To prevent current flow, the surface of the holder may be provided with ribs. No metallic parts are required for securing the conductor rails to the holder. The conductor rail is blocked by clamping profiles on a complementary shaped part of the holder. The holder may rest on a conductor rail bearing for mounting on standard track and pointing sleepers of normal length. A special intermediate mounting for the bearings may be arranged with the rail fastening means or on the sleeper itself, so that it is not necessary to exchange the sleepers for long special sleepers for conductor rail supports. The conductor rail bearing is composed of a truss girder-shaped plastic profile which extends away from the sleeper as a tapering, C-shaped component with high section modulus.
