<ABSTRACT>
Saw blade, especially circular saw blade, with replaceable tips wedged in recesses along the periphery of the blade, and held there by elastic forces, where inwards of each recess but not connected with the recess is at least one tension distributing hole, and where the contour of the blade body runs inwards from a line between the edges of the tips so far that the bottom of the contour lies farther from that line than the outer part of the tension distributing holes, but closer to that line than the inner part of said holes, whereby the elastic wedging forces produce tangential tension stresses and only local compressive stresses.

<DESCRIPTION>
Circular saws have long been used for sawing of wood as well 
as metal. It is known that in order to saw straight, saw 
blades with a thickness less than one percent of the 
diameter have to be provided with internal stresses 
comprising tensile stresses around the periphery and 
compressive stresses in the center, which is accomplished 
through tensioning by hammering or rolling of the central 
parts of the saw blade. A saw blade with correct tensioning 
can be made with a thickness down to 0.5 % of the diameter. 
If in addition the thickness is varied by making the central 
parts thicker, the peripheral parts can be made with a 
thickness down to 0.2 % of the diameter. Thin kerfs are 
economically important because of lesser consumption of raw 
materials and energy. Similarly, to make straight cuts with 
a bandsaw, compressive stresses at the edges must be 
avoided. Since large circular saw blades are heavy and bulky, a need 
has long been felt to make them with replaceable cutting 
tips, to avoid removing and regrinding of the whole saw 
blade when one tooth is damaged. Some earlier suggested 
solutions are shown in the patents US 174,216, US 246,703 
and US 303,787. This need has become stronger as more wear 
resistant but brittle materials have become available, such 
as sintered tungsten carbide, and have been much used as 
permanently brazed tips on circular saw blades and to lesser 
extent on bandsaws. Replaceable tips have found little application on saws, 
restricted to thick circular saws for wood, and for thick 
slot milling cutters. The tip holder designs commonly used 
for lathe tools have not been possible to use on saw blades, 
for several reasons. Tip holders comprising screws require a 
substantial thickness to make room for a screw with 
sufficient strength, and the same holds for holders  
 
comprising various kinds of excentrics. Tip holders where the tip is elastically wedged produce 
compressive stresses in the vicinity and can thus not be 
used for thin saw blades, although they have been used for 
turning of narrow grooves and for slot milling cutters. The 
use of elastically wedged tips is further prevented by the 
heating of the tips and their vicinity relative to the rest 
of the saw blade during sawing, and by tungsten carbide 
having lower heat expansion than steel and thus needing 
harder wedging than what corresponds to the cutting forces. 
It is known that arrangements of slots or holes close to the 
periphery of the saw blade can lower the thermal stresses 
and

Saw blade with replaceable tips (11) of harder material 
which are wedged into a plurality of recesses along the 

periphery of the blade and held there by forces created by 
elastic deformation of the saw blade, and with a contour 

which between the recesses runs inwards from a line between 
the cutting edges forming gullets or slots with a bottom 

(21,22), and with a group of tension distributing holes 
located inwards of each recess, 
characterized
 
in that the group of holes comprises at least one hole 

(18,31,34,35) not connected with the recess, and in that, 
measured from a line between the cutting edges of the tips 

(11), the distance to the bottom of the recess is less than 
the distance to the outer part (19) of the tension 

distributing holes, which is less that the distance to the 
bottom of the contour (21,22), which in turn is less than 

the distance to the inner part (20) of the tension 
distributing holes. 
Saw blade according to claim 1, characterized by the 
group of tension distributing holes having a larger 

tangential extent at the inner part (20) than at the outer 
part (19). 
Saw blade according to claim 2, characterized by the 
group of tension distributing holes comprising a hole with 

inverted T-shape (18). 
Saw blade according to claim 2, characterized by the 
group of tension distributing holes comprising two L-shaped 

holes (34,35). 
Saw blade according to claim 1, characterized by the 
contour comprising one or more slots (23,24,29,30) and by 

the bottom of the contour (21,22) being part of a slot.

tension distributing holes being at least partly narrow 

slots (31,34,35) with curled ends (32).
