<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns novel, crosslinked
polymeric ammonium salts. Uses for these compositions
are as absorbents, electroconductive agents, charge
transfer agents, chelating agents and ion exchange
resins. These salts are also useful as bile acid
sequestrants, i.e., when administered orally, the
polymers lower blood cholesterol levels in mammals.U.S. Patent 4,071,478 describes the use of
crosslinked polymers containing quaternary ammonium
groups in the polymer backbone which are separated by
trimethylene groups. No mention is made of the use of
polymers containing ammonium salts which are not
quaternary ammonium salts.U.S. Patent 4,775,384 describes the reaction of
various organic compounds containing two halogen groups
with various diamines to form polymeric ammonium salts.
These salts are described as water soluble, and are thus
not crosslinked. After further reactions, they are
described as being useful as fiber finishes.U.S. Patent 4,147,586 describes the reaction of
certain dihaloalkanes with alkylene diamines to form
"adducts" which are water soluble. The adducts are
useful, after reaction with an epihalohydrin, for
increasing the wet strength of paper.Several different types of bile acid sequestrants
are known. Some of these are polymers which contain
ammonium salts (amine groups in the salt form) which are
bound to or are part of a polymer molecule. Such
polymers vary in their ability to bind bile acids, their
toxicity and their ease of administration. Thus,
improved bile acid sequestrants are still being sought. U.S. Patent 3,383,281 describes the use of
crosslinked polymers containing amine groups as bile
acid sequestrants. In particular, the use of
crosslinked styrenes containing quaternary ammonium
groups is described. Such resins, which are also useful
as ion exchange resins, are believed to be the active
ingredient in the commercially available cholestyramine
which is used to lower blood cholesterol levels.U.S. Patent 4,027,009 describes the use of linear
(not crosslinked) polymers containing quaternary
ammonium groups in the polymer backbone as bile acid
sequestrants. The nitrogen atoms of the polymer are
connected by methylene chains of designated size, or
other designated groups. No mention is made in this
patent of the use of crosslinked polymers (except as
background information), or the use of polymers
containing ammonium salts that are not quaternary
ammonium salts.This invention includes crosslinked polymeric
ammonium salts, useful as bile acid sequestrants, as
absorbents or as
