<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
detecting and measuring various biological information 
generated by the body of a subject, and particularly it 
relates to a biomagnetic field-measuring apparatus for 
measuring at a high precision the strength of weak magnetic 
fields generated by organs such as the brain, arms, eyeballs 
and heart. The human body generates a variety of biological 
information in response to changes in the external 
environment, and as used herein, the term "biological 
information" refers not only to physiological quantities 
generated by the body, but also includes the absorption of 
X-rays and magnetism. An X-ray tomographic apparatus, known as an X-ray CT 
scanner, provides two-dimensional cross-sectional images 
from the X-ray absorption of sections of the body, and the  
 
images enable the diagnosis of diseases of the head and 
abdomen. A magnetic resonance computed tomography apparatus, 
known as an MRI apparatus, provides information on the 
resonance absorption of hydrogen or carbon atoms, which 
reflects their electronic state, particularly enabling the 
diagnosis of oncocytes. Biomagnetic field-measuring apparatuses, also known as 
MEG apparatuses, detect extremely weak biomagnetism of 10⁻¹² 
T or less from human organs, and they are useful for 
preparing magnetoencephalograms and magnetocardiograms and 
may thus be used for the diagnosis of epilepsy, 
encephalopathy, etc. These measuring apparatuses are all 
weighty, especially biomagnetic field-measuring apparatuses 
which have a total of weight of about 200 kgf. In general, supporting means suspends biomagnetic field-measuring 
means from the ceiling, which is more subject to 
vibration than the floor, and whose vibration is difficult 
to prevent. Another typical prior technique employs a construction 
in which magnetic field-measuring means is mounted on an 
rocking arm anchored to the wall, etc. of a magnetically 
shielded room. With this technique, it is difficult to 
support the magnetic field-measuring means so that it does 
not vibrate.  Also, in an embodiment disclosed in Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Publication (KOKAI) JP-A 2-116767 (1990), the 
foundation of the magnetically shielded room is enlarged, 
and a supporting pillar is provided to directly connect the 
foundation of the magnetically shielded room with the 
supporting means. This construction is a very effective 
means of preventing vibration, but there is no mechanical 
connection between the magnetically shielded room and the 
supporti
