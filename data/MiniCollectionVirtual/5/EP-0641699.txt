<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pneumatic, preferably indirectly controlled brake installation for rail vehicles, with at least one air reservoir 40, at least one pneumatic brake cylinder 3 and at least one control valve 2 for controlling the filling and venting of the brake cylinder, which has a twin-pressure valve 5 connected to the main air line 1 for generating a control pressure for the brake cylinder 3 by means of a fixed filling or charging throttle 19. For uniform release of the brake system, for shortening the release times and for improved charging of the reservoir, the brake installation according to the invention has a pressure differential maintaining device 21 assigned to the twin-pressure valve 2, which device in each release sequence maintains the pressure differential at the charging throttle 19 at a predetermined value.

A pneumatic braking device for rail vehicles, consisting
of


at least one air supply tank (40),
at least one pneumatic braking cylinder (3), and
at least one control valve (2) for controlling the
filling and venting of the brake cylinder (3),

comprising a double pressure valve (5) connected to the
main air supply line (1) for the generation of a

control pressure for the brake cylinders (3) by means
of a fixed filling or loading throttle (19),

characterized in that

the control valve (2) comprises a pressure difference
holding means (21) associated to the double pressure

valve (5), holding in each release operation the
pressure difference at the loading throttle (19) at a

predetermined value.
The braking device according to claim 1,

characterized in that

the pressure difference holding means (21) comprises a
membrane (23) acted upon, for one thing, by a spring (26)

and the pressure in a control chamber (10) of the double 
pressure valve (5) and, for another, by the pressure upstream

of the loading throttle (19), and interacts with a
valve (25, 31) for control of the compressed air

connection between the main air supply line (1) and the
loading throttle (19).
The braking device according to claim 2,

characterized in that

the membrane (23) in a housing (22) separates a chamber
(27) with the spring (26), connected to the control

chamber (10), from a chamber (28) connected to the
loading throttle (19), and in that the valve (25, 31)

controls an opening between a chamber (29) connected to
the main air supply line (1) and the chamber (28)

connected to the loading throttle (19).
The braking device according-to claim 3,

characterized in that

a supply tank (40) communicates with the chamber (28) of
the pressure difference holding means (21), connected to

the loading throttle (19).
The braking device according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that

between the pressure difference holding means (21) and
the loading throttle (19) an operating mode change-over

switch (20) including a shutoff valve (34) and a throttle
(35) connected in parallel thereto is disposed.
The braking device according to one of the preceding
claims,

characterized in that

on the double pressure valve (5) a change-over means for
changing the braking device over from graduated to direct

release operation is arranged. 
The braking device according to one of claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that

to a main chamber (9) of the double pressure valve (5),
connected to the main air supply line (1), a pressure

relief valve (57, 59) controlled by its membrane (7) is
associated.
