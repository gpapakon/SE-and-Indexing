<ABSTRACT>
A process of producing aluminum sheet articles made of 6000 or 2000 series aluminum alloy suitable for manufacture into automotive parts. The process comprises direct chill casting the alloy to produce a cast ingot, scalping the cast ingot to form a scalped ingot, homogenizing the scalped ingot at a temperature between 480 and 580  DEG C for less than 48 hours to form an homogenized ingot, hot rolling the homogenized ingot to an intermediate gauge to form an article of intermediate thickness, and cold rolling the article of intermediate thickness to final gauge, wherein the cold rolling reduces the thickness of the intermediate sheet article by an amount in the range of 15 to 40 % to the final gauge. By limiting the amount of reduction brought about by cold rolling, roping effects exhibited in the fimal product in T4 temper (normally following solutionizing and pre-aging) can be reduced or eliminated. In fact, the cold rolling step can be eliminated entirely, if a suitable reduction of sheet thickness can be achieved by hot rolling alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process of producing
aluminum alloy sheet material having good formability and
yield strength improvement when subjected to the painting
and baking operations typically employed during the
fabricating automotive parts. More particularly, although
not exclusively, the invention relates to the production
of aluminum alloy sheet material suitable for fabricating
automotive parts that are visible in the finished
vehicles, such as automotive skin panels and the like.The automotive industry, in order to reduce the
weight of automobiles, has increasingly substituted
aluminum alloy panels for steel panels. Lighter weight
panels, of course, help to reduce automobile weight, which
reduces fuel consumption, but the introduction of aluminum
alloy panels creates its own set of needs. To be useful
in automobile applications, an aluminum alloy sheet
product must possess good forming characteristics in the
as-received (by the auto manufacturer) T4 temper
condition, so that it may be bent or shaped as desired
without cracking, tearing or wrinkling. At the same time,
the alloy panels, after painting and baking, must have
sufficient strength to resist dents and withstand other
impacts.Several aluminum alloys of the AA (Aluminum
Association) 2000 and 6000 series are usually considered
for automotive panel applications. The AA6000 series 
alloys contain magnesium and silicon, both with and
without copper but, depending upon the Cu content, may be
classified as AA2000 series alloys. These alloys are
formable in the T4 temper condition and become stronger
after painting and baking (steps usually carried out on
formed automotive parts by vehicle manufacturers). Good
increases in strength after painting and baking are highly
desirable so that thinner and therefore lighter panels may
be employed.To facilitate understanding, a brief explanation of
the terminology used to describe alloy tempers may be in
order at this stage. The temper referred to as T4 is well
known (see, for example, Aluminum Standards and Data
(1984), page 11, published by The Aluminum Association)
and refers to alloy produced in the conventional manner,
i.e. without intermediate batch annealing and pre-aging.
This is the temper in which automotive sheet products are
normally delivered to parts manufacturers for forming into
skin panels and the like. T8 temper designates an alloy
that has been solution heat-treated, cold worked and then
artificially aged. Artificial aging involves holding the
alloy at elevated temperature(s) over a

A process of producing sheet articles made of 6000 series aluminium
alloy, in which a cast ingot is formed by direct chill casting, the ingot is

scalped to form a scalped ingot, the scalped ingot is homogenized at a
temperature between 480 and 580°C for less than 48 hours to form an

homogenized ingot, and the ingot is rolled to form a sheet article of final
gauge, wherein said homogenized ingot is re
duced in thickness
by hot and optionally cold rolling to form an article of intermediate gauge that

requires a reduction in thickness in the range of 15% to less than 30% to
reach final gauge, followed by cold rolling said article of intermediate gauge to form

said sheet article of said final gauge, provided that, when both hot and
cold rolling are employed to produce said article of intermediate gauge, a heat

treatment step is carried out on said article of intermediate gauge to anneal
said article, prior to cold rolling to final gauge.
