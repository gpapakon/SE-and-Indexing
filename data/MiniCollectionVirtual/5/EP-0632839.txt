<ABSTRACT>
The invention is an apparatus and method for performing automated sample preparation, DNA amplification and detection, which includes specimen carriers (30) for holding specimens and reagents, device for heating (12) and cooling (48) and maintaining the specimen to or at any given temperature for any given time periods, and a computer (60) to generate signals that control temperatures and times. The specimen carrier (30) may be used with other kinds of heating (12) and cooling device (48) as an evaporation-controlled device when the specimen carrier base (33) and cover (44) are brought together to form a chamber over the biological specimen area (58).

<DESCRIPTION>
 THERMAL PROCESSING OF BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to the field of automated analyzers for nucleic acid"---. diagnostics, in particular to temperature control devices which can quickly heat and 5 cool, maintain a stable setpoint and contain the sample and reagents during thermal cycling. Description of the Related ArtThis invention more fully describes an embodiment of the carrier which incorporates a standard microscope slide as part of the carrier and a temperature control10 system and its integration with a carrier assembly for more precise temperature regulation, as first described in U.S. Patent No. 5,188,963 issued February 23, 1993, and also in international patent application No. PCT US90/06768. The carrier assembly comprises multiple carriers, which may use a microscope slide as the main portion of each specimen carrier base. The carrier in the aforementioned references15 contains a fixed biological specimen during biochemical and molecular reactions and allows a first reagent to be added and displaced by a second reagent or wash through a unidirectional fluid-flow channel, said channel defined by the carrier base and a cover, through which reaction fluids are introduced for complexation with target molecules of a specimen, with the provision of a collection trough into which spent fluids drain from20 the carrier base. In this invention another embodiment of the carrier cover forms at least one closed chamber over a standard microscope slide or a carrier base during steps in the processing requiring evaporation control.The in situ amplification process (described in U. S. Patent No. 5,188,963 and international patent application No. PCT/US90/06768 filed November 16, 1990) uses25 enzymes such as polymerase or ligase, separately or in combination, to repeatedly generate more copies of a target nucleic acid sequence within cells by primer extensions to incorporate new nucleotides or by ligations of adjacent complementary oligonucleotides, wherein each template generates more copies and the copies may themselves become template. By melting complementary strands of nucleic acids, the30 original strand and each new strand synthesized are potential templates for repeated primer annealing or ligation reactions to make and expand the number of specific, amplified products. A thermostable polymerase with reverse transcriptase activity and 

a thermostable ligase are now both available and increase the choice of enzymes and

CLAIMS What is claimed is:
1. An apparatus for providing temperature control to a specimen carrier, comprising: (a) one or more specimen carriers, each of said specimen carriers comprising a thin compartment for holding a specimen and reaction fluids; (b) a temperature-controlled plate having a first position in thermal contact with one side of said specimen carriers placed at said site and a second position out of said thermal contact; (c) means for moving said temperature-controlled heating plate between said first position and second position; (d) means for providing laminar air flow between said temperature- controlled plate and said specimen carriers when said temperature- controlled plate is in said second position; (e) temperature control means capable of adjusting the temperature of said temperature-controlled plate in response to control signals; and (f) computer control means connected to said temperature control means and to said means for providing laminar air flow, wherein when said temperature-controlled plate is in the first position, the temperature of the specimen carriers may be brought to a first temperature through thermal contact with the temperature-controlled plate and when the temperature- controlled plate is in the second position, laminar air flow provided between the temperature-controlled plate and the specimen carriers may be used to bring the carriers to a second temperature.
