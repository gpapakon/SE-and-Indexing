<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for the production of screens for the protection of electrical and/or electronic components, appliances or installations against electrical or magnetic interference fields, which method is characterised in that a non-woven (fleece), a filter, a woven fabric or a gauze 7 made of a metallic material which is at least electrically conductive is fitted, such that it covers the surface, into a bounded moulding cavity 4 in an injection-moulding die 1, and is then stabilised by spraying or moulding a plastic material layer 8 on at least one side to form a composite structured body 6.
