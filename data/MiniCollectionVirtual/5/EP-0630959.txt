<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel additive composition for
use in motor fuels. The additive comprises the reaction product
obtained by reacting a 4-alkyl-2-morpholinone with a
hydrocarboxypolyoxyalkylene amine to produce a motor fuel -
soluble amidoalkanolamine compound which provides a number of
valuable properties in a motor fuel composition.The combustion of a hydrocarbon motor fuel in an internal
combustion engine leads to the formation and accumulation of
deposits on various parts of the combustion chamber as well as
on the fuel intake and exhaust system of the engine. The
presence of deposits in the combustion chamber seriously reduces
the operating efficiency of the engine. First, deposit
accumulation within the combustion chamber inhibits heat transfer
between the chamber and the engine cooling system. This leads
to higher temperatures within the combustion chamber, resulting
in increases in the end gas temperature of the incoming charge.
Consequently, end gas auto-ignition occurs causing engine knock.
In addition, the accumulation of deposits within the combustion
chamber reduces the volume of the combustion zone, causing a
higher than design compression ratio in the engine. This, in
turn, can also lead to engine knocking. A knocking engine does
not effectively utilize the energy of combustion. Moreover, a
prolonged period of engine knocking can cause stress fatigue and
wear in pistons, connecting rods, bearings and cam rods of the
engine. The phenomenon noted is characteristic of gasoline
powered internal combustion engines. It may be overcome by
employing a higher octane gasoline which resists knocking for 
powering the engine. This need for a highen octane gasoline as
mileage accumulates has become known as the engine octane
requirement increase (ORI) phenomenon. It is particularly
advantageous if engine ORI can be substantially reduced or
eliminated by preventing or modifying deposit formation in the
combustion chambers of the engine.Another problem common to internal combustion engines is the
formation of intake valve deposits. Intake valve deposits
interfere with valve closing and eventually will lead to valve
burning. Such deposits interfere with valve motion and valve
seating and tend to reduce the volumetric efficiency of the
engine and to limit the maximum design power. Valve deposits may
be produced from thermally and oxidatively unstable fuel or from
lubricating oil oxidation products. The hard carbonaceous
deposits produced collect in the tubes and runners that are part
of the
