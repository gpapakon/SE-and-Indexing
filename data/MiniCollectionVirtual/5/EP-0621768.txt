<ABSTRACT>
Hearing aid, comprising at least one microwave generator (9) which receives an electrical signal from, for example, a microphone (27) and generates a frequency-modulated electrical signal composed of bursts, the burst frequency depending on the sounds picked up by the microphone, which frequency-modulated signal is fed to a radiator (25, 26) which generates microwave radiation (28) made up of bursts, at least the radiator (25, 26) of the hearing aid being situated in the ear canal (11) of a hearing organ and the microwave generator (9) being designed in such a way that the burst frequencies are at least virtually equal to the sound frequencies of the sounds picked up by the microphone.

<DESCRIPTION>
Hearing aid based on microwavesThe present invention relates to a hearing aid, comprising at least one microwave generator which receives an electrical signal from a sound transducing unit, for example a microphone, and gener¬ ates a frequency-modulated electrical signal composed of bursts, the burst frequency depending on the sounds picked up by the sound transducing unit, which frequency-modulated signal is fed to a radiator which generates microwave radiation made up of bursts. Such a hearing aid is disclosed by US Patent Specification US-A-4,877,027. A device is described therein in which a deaf per¬ son is irradiated with microwaves having a pattern which is such that when they arrive at the brain of said deaf person, they excite a hearing sensation. The device is composed of a microphone or the like for converting sound waves into an electrical audio signal. Said audio signal is fed to a pulse generator which excites bursts of microwave pulses. The microwaves are in the region between 100 MHz and 10,000 MHz, the neutral spacing of the bursts depending on the intensity of the electrical audio signal. In this connection, only intensity values of the electrical audio signal above a prede¬ termined threshold value are taken into consideration. In this way, a frequency modulation of the electrical audio signal takes place. With the aid of a microwave generator, the frequency-modulated sig¬ nal is converted into microwaves which are transmitted via an aer- ial in the direction of the head of the deaf person. The microwaves generated reach the brain through the skull of the person and excite electrical signals therein which are perceived as sound sensation. The known device has several disadvantages. First of all, it is difficult to keep the microwave bundle which is radiated directed at the head of the deaf person, which is generally in con¬ tinuous movement. Secondly, the spacing between the aerial and the person concerned is not constant, with the result that the oper¬ ation of the known device will depend on the position which the person concerned assumes. Moreover, it is unclear how the de odu- lation of the frequency-modulated signal takes place in the known device: the frequency of the bursts of microwave pulses is between 1 kHz and 100 kHz, which does not directly correspond to the fre¬ quencies of the sound waves perceived, which are, after all, pri- 

 marily in the region of a few tens of Hz to approximately 20 kHz. The quality of the sound perception of the deaf person is therefore mediocre

Claims
1. Hearing aid, comprising at least one microwave generator which receives an electrical signal from a sound transducing unit, for example a microphone, and generates a frequency-modulated elec- trical signal composed of bursts, the burst frequency depending on the sounds picked up by the sound transducing unit, which frequen¬ cy-modulated signal is fed to a radiator which generates microwave radiation made up of bursts, characterized in that at least the radiator (25, 26) of the hearing aid is situated in the ear canal (11) of a hearing organ and the microwave generator (9) is so designed that the burst frequencies are substantially equal to the sound frequencies of the sounds picked up by the sound transducing unit (27).
2. Hearing aid according to Claim 1 , characterized in that the microwave frequency within the bursts is selected on the basis of the precise composition of the gas mixture in the middle-ear cavity (15) of the hearing organ in such a way that a photoacoustic effect occurs in the middle ear.
3. Hearing aid according to Claim 1 , characterized in that the microwave frequency within the bursts is selected on the basis of the precise composition of the fluid in the cochlea (17) of the hearing organ in such a way that a photoelectric effect occurs therein.
4. Hearing aid according to Claim 1 , characterized in that the microwaves within the bursts comprise two frequency components, one of which excites a photoacoustic effect in the middle ear and the other a photoelectric effect in the inner ear.
5. Hearing aid according to Claim 1 , characterized in that two radiators (25, 26) are situated in the ear canal (11) and excite microwave radiation (28) having a wavelength of approximately 9.5 cm which is directed into the hearing organ in such a way that it is able to reach the cochlea (17) via the oval window in order to remedy auditory hallucinations.
