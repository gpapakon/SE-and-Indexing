<ABSTRACT>
The lock according to the present invention comprises a slide (3) that, when the door comes near to the wing, is freed and released by a spring latch (2) and performs a downward movement until a lower dead point, thus causing the insertion of the bolts into the respective seats and the operation of a stop (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a lock for the automatic 
closing of doors, main doors, shutters and similar, 
of the kind that determines a block without any 
intervention by the user. In the art, European patent EP A 099 292 is known 
in which a safety locking device for doors is 
shown, presenting the following features 
and functionalities: 
locking of the latches only at the end of the 
run, while in the intermediate positions said 
latches are free and therefore may be opened; it is necessary to use the key for unlocking the 
lock of the latches, from inside as well as from 
outside, so that only after the use of the key 
and by means of a handle said latches will be 
taken out of their seats; it is necessary to use springs and 
counterweights for supplying a considerable 
force for operating the system, braked by the 
presence of contrast springs; the functionality of the click or slide of the 
lock, which has no other function than the one 
of determining the outlet of the latches, as it 
remains inside withour reaching the outlet 
position; the need of addition of a conventional lock, as 
the invention consists of a device that causes 
the movement of a group of locks. The lock according to the present invention solves 
the problem of performing, at each closing, the 
automatic insertion of safety means by means of 
purely mechanical controls making use of the force 
of gravity acting on the single components. Such a problem is solved by an automatic closing lock according to claim 1. The advantages of the lock according to the present 
invention are many and considerable: 
it determines the automatic closing of the bolt 
due to the force of gravity; it allows the opening from inside by means of 
a handle; from the outside, due to the particular shape 
of the key, the same may be inserted, through an 
eyelet much smaller than the safety cylinder, and 
the opening is possible in whatever position the 
lock mechanism is placed at the moment of use. The lock accoding to the present invention will 
be described more in detail hereinbelow according 
to the enclosed drawings, in which a preferred embodiment 
is shown. 
Figure 1shows a plan view of the automatic closing lock  
 
with the components in the position cf open 
door. Figure 2shows the lock in the closing step, with the 
spring latch nearly completely returned. Figure 3shows the outlet position of the bolts CA 
in a door being already in safety conditions. Figures 4 and 5show, in an exemplified form, the single 
elements of the lock. The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An automatic closing lock comprising a slide (3) 
connected with bolts (CA) and provided with a 

first abutment (F) and a second abutment (D), said 
slide (3) being blocked in a first position by a 

spring latch (2) provided with a plane engaging 
the first abutment (F) of the slide, and released 

by the spring latch (2) when the door gets near to 
the wing, so that the slide can slide downwards 

due to gravity, inserting the bolts (CA) into 
their respective seats, and moving a connecting 

rod (4) of a further bolt (5) as to insert the 
bolt (5) into its respective seat, while the 

second abutment (D) of the slide abuts against a 
stop (13), characterized in that the slide (3) is 

further provided with a blocking element (B) 
having three steps which, when the slide is 

released by the spring latch (2) and reaches its 
lower position, are engaged by the teeth of a gear 

segment (8), connected to the slide (3) in such a 
way that sliding of the slide (3) involves a 

rotation of said gear segment (8), as to block the 
slide and all elements connected thereto, the 

spring latch (2) being then pushed by a lever (11) 
and a spring (12) into a suitable hole provided in 

the wing, and in that the plane (H )of the spring  
 

latch (2) is an inclined plane and the bolt (5) is 
a rotating bolt, which is rotated by the 

connecting rod (4) to be inserted into its seat. 
An automatic closing lock according to claim 1, 
characterized in that when the lock is opened from 

outside through the rotation of a key (19), said 
rotation is transferred to a pinion (7), which 

matches with the gear segment (8), said segment 
being provided with a pin (M) which acts onto the 

upper side of a hole (C) of the slide (3) as to 
rise the slide which, by moving, causes first the 

drawing of the bolts (CA) and, in the last part of 
its run, releases the stop (13) by means of the 

push of a third abutment (E) of the slide on a 
portion (S) of the stop (13) and, by action of an 

element (G) of the slide (3) onto a part (I) of a 
return lever (11) provided with a hole (N) jointed 

to a pin (O) of the spring latch (2), moves the 
spring latch inside the lock. 
An automatic closing lock according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the opening of the lock from 

inside is obtained by rotation of a handle, wihout 
any use of a key, by means of a lever (9) having 

its fulcrum with a pin (Y) inserted therein, and 
provided with a square joint at the end of said  

 
pin for coupling with said handle and, at the 

opposite end, provided with a pin (K) that 
connects said lever (9) with a connecting rod (10) 

provided with eyelet so that, during the rotation 
of the handle, the connecting rod is moved and, 

through the eyelet hooked to a pin (M) of the gear 
segment (8), the movement is transmitted to the 

gear segment (8), said pin acting onto the upper 
side of a hole (C) of the slide (3) as to rise the 

slide which, by moving, causes first the drawing 
of the bolts (CA) and, in the last part of its 

run, releases the stop (13) by means of the push 
of a third abutment (E) of the slide (3) on a 

portion (S) of the stop (13) and, by action of an 
element (G) of the slide (3) onto a part (I) of a 

return lever (11) provided with a hole (N) jointed 
to a pin (O) of a spring latch (2), moves the 

spring latch inside the lock.
