<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluorinated polymers
containing perfluoropolyoxyalkylene sequences and having
thermoplastic elastomeric properties, endowed with high flexibility
at low temperatures and superior mechanical properties
at high temperatures. Such products can be utilized as
sealing agents or for the manufacture of gaskets or fittings
(pipes, couplings, etc.) to be employed in severe
working conditions, where strong thermal variations and
chemically aggressive substances are present.From US Patent 3,810,874 fluorinated polymers are
known, such as polyurethanes, polysiloxanes, polyesters,
polycarbonates, polyesters-polyurea, polyamides, polyimides,
containing perfluoropolyoxyalkylene sequences of formula:
-CF2O-(CF2CF2O)m-(CF2O)n-CF2-
wherein m/n = 0.2-5, linked each other by non-fluorinated
monomeric units. Such polymers are obtained starting from a
perfluoropolyoxyalkylene corresponding to formula (I) functionalized
at both ends with a suitable reactive group (for
example -OH, -NH2, -CN, etc.) capable of giving polycondensation
reactions with the typical organic reagents utilized 
in polycondensation reactions, such as polyisocyanates, polyacids,
phosgene, anhydrides, diacylhalides, etc.Other fluorinated polymers having polyacetalic structure,
obtained by polycondensation of perfluoropolyoxyalkylene
diols with formaldehyde, are described in Italian patent
application No. 1990/MI 92A in the name of the Applicant.As illustrated in US patent 3,810,874 above,
the functionalized perfluoropolyoxyalkylenes
are prepared starting from the corresponding
perfluoropolyoxyalkylenes having -COF end groups.For instance diols of formula:
HO-CH2-CF2O-(CF2CF2O)m-(CF2O)n-CF2-CH2-OH
are preparable by reducing by means of lithium and aluminium
hydride diacylfluorides of formula:
FCO-CF2O-(CF2CF2O)m-(CF2O)n-CF2-COFThe hydroxyl groups of the diols of formula (II) can be
in their turn transformed into other functional groups, such
as sulphonic, amino, nitrile groups, etc., by reactions well
known in the art. For instance from diols of formula (II)
the sulphonic esters of formula
CF3SO2OCH2CF2O(CF2CF2O)m-(CF2O)n-CF2CH2OSO2CF3
can be obtained by reaction with CF3SO2F.In their turn, the sulphonic esters of formula (IV) can 
be utilized for the preparation of the corresponding diamines
of formula:
H2N-CH2-CF2O-(CF2CF2O)m(CF2O)nCF2-CH2-NH2
by reaction with anhydrous liquid ammonia.As known, perfluoropolyoxyalkylenes having -COF end
groups, and therefore all the other functionalized perfluoropolyoxyalkylenes
