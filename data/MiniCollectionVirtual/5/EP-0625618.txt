<ABSTRACT>
The facade panel (1) for a curtain wall comprises a rectangular backing panel (2) and a decorative and weather-resistant cladding layer (3) which is arranged on the outer side (2a) of said backing panel. The backing panel (2) is a panel which is reinforced on both sides with glass fabric and consists of expanded glass granules bound by means of a foamed organic binder. The backing panel (2) is enclosed on its borders (2b) by a frame (4) and is connected to the latter via a plurality of screws or rivets (7) which extend through the backing panel (2). The frame (4) comprises four aluminium profiles (5) each having an essentially L-shaped cross-section, of which the short leg (5a) encloses the backing panel (2) on the border (2b) and the long leg (5b) bears on the rear side of the backing panel (2) and is penetrated by the rivets (7) or screws. Formed on the outer side, of the long leg (5b), directed away from the rearside of the backing panel is a fit-in groove (8) which is open towards the short leg (5a) and is intended for fitting on retaining angles (9) which, for their part, may be fitted on vertical posts (10) of a substructure connected to the building.
