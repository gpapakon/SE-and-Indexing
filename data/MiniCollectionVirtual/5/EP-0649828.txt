<ABSTRACT>
In order to remove the olefinic impurities (in particular 1-chloro-2,2-difluoroethylene and polyfluoropropenes) present in crude 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (F134a), a gaseous mixture of crude F134a, hydrofluoric acid and oxygen or air is treated in the gas phase, in the presence of a fluorination catalyst, at a temperature of between 200 and 350 DEG C and at a pressure of between atmospheric pressure and 2.5 MPa, the HF/F134a molar ratio being between 0.05 and 0.5 and the O2/F134a molar ratio between 0.001 and 0.1.

Process for the purification of a crude 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane 
(F134a) containing unsaturated 

impurities, characterized in that a gaseous mixture of 
crude 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, hydrofluoric acid and 

oxygen or air is treated in the gas phase, at a temperature 
between 200 and 350Â°C and at a pressure ranging from 

atmospheric pressure to 2.5 MPa, in the presence of a 
fluorination catalyst, the HF/F134a molar ratio being 

between 0.05 and 0.5 and the O
2
/F134a molar ratio being 
between 0.001 and 0.1. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which the 
unsaturated impurities are 1-chloro-2,2-difluoroethylene 

and/or C
3
 or C
4
 (chloro)fluorinated olefins. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
reaction is carried out at a pressure between atmospheric 

pressure and 1.5 MPa. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in 
which the contact time is between 10 and 200 seconds, 

preferably between 20 and 100 seconds. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in 
which the HF/F134a molar ratio is between 0.125 and 

0.200. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in 
which the O
2
/F134a molar ratio is between 0.005 and 0.05. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, in 
which the reaction is carried out with pure oxygen. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, in 
which air is used. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8, in 
which the fluorination catalyst is a bulk or supported  

 
catalyst based on chromium, nickel, iron, manganese, 

cobalt and/or zinc.
