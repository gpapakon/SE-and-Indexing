<ABSTRACT>
The chuck (3), the bar (7) which operates it, and the 
cylinder and piston assembly (5) which moves the bar are 

axially hollow and form a vertical duct (C) which is open at 
the top next to the workpiece (P) and which is open at the 

bottom over a conveyor (13) with a filter and a unit for 
collecting and pumping the cutting fluid. The chips from the 

piece are channelled and removed downwards through the said 
duct (C) by at least one jet of fluid at high pressure, 

which has a location and direction such that it strikes the 
chip after its formation without interfering with the normal 

jet of fluid at low pressure which is applied to the tool 
(315). The said jet or jets of fluid at high pressure 

consist of the same cutting fluid as that which is directed 
against the tool at low pressure. The chips leaving the 

lower end of the said duct fall on to the conveyor (13) 
which removes them and separates them from the cutting fluid 

which, when suitably filtered, is returned to circulation by 
low-pressure and high-pressure pumps (19-20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is intended to resolve the problem 
of the removal of chips in boring mills, in order to prevent 
the chips from remaining in the working region of the tool 
and causing problems concerning the quality of machining of 
the piece, the life of the tool and the automation of the 
working cycle of the boring mill.  
 JP-A-61-203246 describes a 
method for the controlled removal of chips in a boring 
mill of the type comprising a table for holding a workpiece, 
a cutting tool (315) for cutting the 
workpiece, 
means disposed above said workpiece 
for feeding a cutting fluid to said workpiece during the 
cutting operations, and means 
for collecting said cutting fluid, 
the method comprising the steps of 
forming a vertical duct through said table 
open at the top end next to the said workpiece 
held by table, and open at its bottom end over 
said cutting fluid collecting means, 
directing at the cutting zone 
cutting fluid to lubricate and cool the tool, 
removing by filtration said chips from said cutting fluid, 
and 
recycling said filtered cutting fluid.  
 JP-A-61-203246 also describes a 
boring mill comprising a table 
for holding a workpiece, holder 
means for a cutting tool for cutting said 
workpiece, 
a vertical duct in said table which is 
open at the top end next to the workpiece held by the 
table and which is open at the opposite, bottom end over 
cutting fluid collecting means, cutting fluid 
supplying means for 
directing at the cutting zone 
cutting fluid to lubricate and cool the tool, 
means for removing by filtration said chips from said 
collected cutting fluid, and pump means for 
recycling said filtered cutting fluid.  
 The invention resolves this problem by the method as claimed 
in claim 1 and by a boring mill as claimed in claim 9. 
The chuck of the boring 
mill and the corresponding operating bar, together with the 
moving unit of the cylinder and piston assembly which 
provides the axial movement of the bar, are made with an 
axially hollow shape, so that they form a vertical duct 
which is open at the top next to the workpiece mounted in 
the chuck, and with is open at the bottom above a conveyor 
with a filter and a unit for collecting and pumping the 
cutting fluid. The chips which are formed during the 
machining of the piece mounted in the chuck are transported 
and removed downwards, through the said duct, by at least 
one jet of fluid at high pressure, for example of the order 
of at least 130-200 bar, which has a location and direction
