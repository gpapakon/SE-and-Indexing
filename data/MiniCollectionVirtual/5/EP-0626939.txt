<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel series of tri-substituted phenyl derivatives,
to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions
containing them, and to their use in medicine.Many hormones and neurotransmitters modulate tissue function by
elevating intra-cellular levels of adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate
(cAMP). The cellular levels of cAMP are regulated by mechanisms which
control synthesis and breakdown. The synthesis of cAMP is controlled by
adenyl cyclase which may be directly activated by agents such as forskolin
or indirectly activated by the binding of specific agonists to cell surface
receptors which are coupled to adenyl cyclase. The breakdown of cAMP
is controlled by a family of phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes, which
also control the breakdown of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate
(cGMP). To date, seven members of the family have been described
(PDE I-VII) the distribution of which varies from tissue to tissue. This
suggests that specific inhibitors of PDE isoenzymes could achieve
differential elevation of cAMP in different tissues, [for reviews of PDE
distribution, structure, function and regulation, see Beavo & Reifsnyder
(1990) TIPS, 11: 150-155 and Nicholson et al (1991) TIPS, 12: 19-27].There is clear evidence that elevation of cAMP in inflammatory leukocytes
leads to inhibition of their activation. Furthermore, elevation of cAMP in
airway smooth muscle has a spasmolytic effect. In these tissues, PDE IV
plays a major role in the hydrolysis of cAMP. It can be expected,
therefore, that selective inhibitors of PDE IV would have therapeutic
effects in inflammatory diseases such as asthma, by achieving both anti-inflammatory
and bronchodilator effects.The design of PDE IV inhibitors has met with limited success to date, in
that many of the potential PDE IV inhibitors which have been synthesised
have lacked potency and/or have been capable of inhibiting more than one
type of PDE isoenzyme in a non-selective manner. Lack of a selective 
action has been a particular problem given the widespread role of cAMP in
vivo and what is needed are potent selective PDE IV inhibitors with an
inhibitory action against PDE IV and little or no action against other PDE
isoenzymes.WO 92/19594 describes N-substituted pyrrolidinones as PDE IV inhibitors.We have now found a novel series of tri-substituted phenyl derivatives,
members of which compared to known structurally similar compounds are
potent inhibitors of PDE IV at concentrations at which they have little or no
inhibitory action
