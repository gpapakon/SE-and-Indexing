<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made in the course of research supported in part by NIH grants AR38188 and AR39740.
The Government may have certain rights in this invention.Expression of many exogenous genes is readily obtained in a variety of recombinant host-vector systems,
but becomes difficult to obtain if the protein normally requires extensive post-translational processing. This is the likely
reason that expression in a fully recombinant system has not been reported for any of the major fibrillar collagens that
require processing by post-translational enzymes. See Prockop and Kivirikko, N. Engl. J. Med. 1984, 311, 376-386.
Prolyl 4-hydroxylase is probably one of the most important post-transiational enzyme necessary for synthesis of procollagen
or collagen by cells because it is required to hydroxylate prolyl residues in the Y-position of the repeating -Gly-X-Y-
sequences to 4-hydroxyproline. Prockop and Kivirikko, N. Engl. J. Med.1984, 311, 376-386. Unless an appropriate
number of Y-position prolyl residues are hydroxylatedto 4-hydroxyproline by prolyl 4-hydroxylase, the newly synthesize
chains cannot fold into a triple-helical conformation at 37°C. If the hydroxylation does not occur, the polypeptides remain
non-helical, are poorly secreted by cells, and cannot self-assemble into collagen fibrils. Recently, prolyl 4-hydroxylase,
was expressed in baculovirus. Vuorio, K. et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, U.S.A.,1992, 89,
7467-7470.Schnieke et al., Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A.1987, 84, 8869-8873 and Lee et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1989, 264,
20683-20687, disclose rescue experiments in two different systems that synthesized only one of the two chains for
type I procollagen. Schnieke et al. reported that a gene for the human fibrillar collagen proal(I) chain, the COL1A1
gene, can be expressed in mouse fibroblasts and that the chains are used to assemble molecules of type I procollagen,
the precursor of type I collagen. However, in this system the proα2(I) chains found in the same molecule are of mouse
origin. In the system of Lee et al. the proα1(I) chains are of rat origin. Thus, synthesis of a precollagen molecule in
which all three chains are derived from an exogenous gene was not obtained by either Schnieke et al. or Lee et al.Failure to obtain expression of genes for fibrillar collagens in a fully recombinant system has hampered attempts
to study the normal structure-function relationships of the proteins and to study the effects of mutations. In
particular, mutations in the gene for type II
