<ABSTRACT>
The interface circuit [1] gives the user two-way 

communication with electric appliances [APP1, APP2,APPn] 

connected to a data bus [S,N] for integrally managing a 

household kitchen via the telephone line. 
Around a main controller [2], it comprises signal detector 

[6] that is inter-connected with telephone tone detector/ 

generator [3], and voice and tone signals recorder/ 

reproducer (4), in addition to having variable user 
message memories [5]
 belonging to the recorder (4), and 
various external memories holding fixed response data 

addressed by the controller using a decoding process, and 
a FSK modem [11]
 for coupling said data bus [S,N] to 

interface circuit [1].

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a interface circuit transmitting 
electrical communications received from the telephone line 
in the form of audio signals or multi-frequency tone 
signals, to a household data bus for controlling 
electrical appliances, data processed and converted into 
suitable signals so that the circuit interconnects both 
paths, the telephone line and the appliance data bus by 
two way addressing of signals and messages. Remote or local household appliance control systems are 
known which comprise an electric circuit controller 
telephone interface circuit, or appliance management 
terminals which, in addition to a telephone tone 
detector/generator, include an on-line audio player/recorder 
are known, those described in Patent 
Specifications WO 89/11194, US 4,885,766, GB 2 230 163, US 
5,038,372 T-D, and CA 2,022,293. These systems or devices transmit coded telephone signals 
directly from the controller to a range of individual 
switches related to the electric household appliances or 
to other telephone receivers for starting and stopping 
them, and such transmission takes place through a range of 
multiplexer paths leading from the controller. The audio 
recorder-player which embodies these systems fulfils 
merely the function of an audio interface to record the  
 
transmitter telephone audio messages and subsequently play 
them back and transmit controller responses into the 
telephone line to confirm that correct codes have been 
received, but it does not take part in managing each 
appliance. The device provided with the interface circuit for the 
systems in the above-mentioned patents is not itself an 
household appliance which performs integral control tasks 
with other appliances connected to the household data bus, 
and instead merely acts as an interface with the 
particular paths or switches for each appliance. In the procedure pursued for connection and communication 
between the remote telephone and the appliances, the above 
mentioned systems receive from the appliance to which the 
command is addressed, a reply to denote the on/off 
switching condition of the relevant breaker, or 
alternatively a power consumption reading if a power meter 
has been connected to such breaker, but no other kind of 
situations such as status of carrying out an appliance 
program, deficiencies and operating faults in the 
appliance, or message data relating to the coordination 
among several inter-related appliances, because those 
appliances possess no integral smart system, nor are they 
co

1.- A TELEPHONE INTERFACE CIRCUIT (1) FOR AN APPLIANCE 
DATA BUS for operating such appliances (APP1,APP2,APPn) 

locally or from a remote telephone, with means of coupling 
to the telephone line for detecting the call, and for 

detecting audio signals and tone signals, a circuit (1) 
capable of performing the tasks of a telephone answering 

machine with audio replies and audio message recording 
using a player/recorder (4) provided with external 

memories (5), and capable of decoding commands sent by the 
user from the telephone line by means of an DTMF 

detector/generator (3), so that they can be processed by 
an integral controller (2) which relays them to the 

electric household appliances, where said controller is 
provided with external memories (23,24) for storing 

program data and system fixed messages, characterized in 
that for its application in managing through a common data 

bus (S, N) a plurality of household appliances which are 
fitted with integral smart system, it transmits message 

data and execution and monitoring commands in both 
directions, and in one direction it records the audio 

messages, or converts the telephone line dual tones into 
binary data signals to be distributed via said common data 

bus (S, N), and in the other direction, converts data from 
the appliances into audio messages or telephone call 

signals for the user, for which purpose, on the one side, 
the signal detector (6), a recorder/reproducer (4), and 

the DTMF detector/generator (3) are interconnected with 
and assist controller (2) to distribute, interpret and 

execute the command in the form of transmitted tones, or 
the message in the form of a transmitted voice, using 

therefore the recorder integral memories (5) storing 
variable user messages, and the controller external 

memories (23,24) storing permanently fixed data from the 
interface circuit procedure, and on the other, an FSK 

 
modem 11 allows direct communication with each appliance 

via said common bus. 
2.- AN INTERFACE CIRCUIT in accordance with Claim 1, 
wherein the controller (2) used for processing and 

transmitting two directional data comprises in combination 
a micro-controller (20) fitted with an internal digital 

data transceiver, a chip selector (21) which assists 
discriminating voice and audio signals and distributes 

them automatically to recorder (4) or to detector (3) 
respectively, a decoder (22), and a logical circuit (26), 

both of which assist the chip selector in addressing a 
range of external program data and permanent set data 

memories (23, 24) that correspond to preset responses 
related to the working of the electric household 

appliances (APPn). 
3.- AN INTERFACE CIRCUIT in accordance with the preceding 
Claims, wherein the dual telephone tone detector/generator 

(3) comprises a transceiver (30) which integrates all 
detection, conversion, recording, generation and 

transmission tasks, and a logical circuit (31, 32) 
interposed on the signals originating from controller (2). 
4.-AN INTERFACE CIRCUIT in accordance with Claim 1, 
wherein the FSK modem (11) for direct data transmission 

between controller (2) and an electric household appliance 
(APPn) via power line comprises a current carrier 

transceiver (60), a signal conditioner circuit (62), and 
a transformer coupling circuit (62).
