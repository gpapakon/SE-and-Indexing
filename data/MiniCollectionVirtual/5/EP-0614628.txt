<ABSTRACT>
A compact (10) for containing material (e.g., cosmetics), 
having a base (11) and/or a cover (12) constituted of a 

peripheral frame (24) and a central panel (28) mounted 
therein for rotation between inwardly and outwardly facing 

positions. In a base so constituted, the panel is a 
material-holding tray. In a cover so constituted, at least 

one side of the panel may bear a mirror.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compacts, and in an important
specific sense more particularly to compacts for containing
cosmetics for application by an end user.For purposes of illustration, the invention will be described
herein as embodied in compacts for cosmetics, it being understood,
however, that its broader aspects the invention is not limited
thereto but may be embodied in compacts for containing other types
of materials as well.Many cosmetics materials, including face powders, foundations,
eye shadows, blushes, and some lipsticks and mascaras, are commonly
placed (for retail sale and subsequent end use) in containers known
as compacts. A conventional compact includes a base formed as a
tray with one or more upwardly open recesses for holding the
cosmetic material in compressed or like stable condition, and a
cover for overlying the base and enclosing the tray to prevent the
contents from drying out, becoming contaminated, spilling, or
soiling outside objects. One or more brushes, pads or other
implements for applying the cosmetics may also be placed within the
compact between the base and cover.In these conventional compacts, the base and cover are
typically molded of plastic or formed of metal, and are hinged
together in clamshell fashion along one side of the compact, a
manually operably latch being provided on the other side to hold
them in closed position. The compact is dimensioned to be held in
the hand, and may be square, rectangular, oval, circular, or of
other regular or irregular shape. To apply the contained cosmetics,
the user opens the compact, draws an applying implement (or
a finger) across the cosmetic material held in a recess of the base 
tray to pick up some of the material, and conveys it on the
implement to the appropriate facial area.It is frequently desirable to package a compact in a manner
enabling retail customers to view the contained cosmetic material
at the point of sale without exposing the material to contamination
such as can occur if a compact is opened at a store by a prospective
purchaser. Accordingly, the compact may be sealed in a
transparent plastic film, e.g., in a blister package, with the
cover opened to lie flat with the base so that the contents of the
compact are clearly visible through the blister film. A problem
with this type of packaging, however, is that the area of the
package must ordinarily be at least twice the area of the closed
compact, because the base and cover lie open at 180°, or approximately
at 180°, to each other; hence the packages

<CLAIMS>
A compact comprising a hingedly connected base member and cover
member, the base member comprising a frame defining a through opening

and a panel formed as a tray for holding material which is pivotally mounted
about an axis extending across the through opening, wherein the panel is

rotatable about the axis into and out of at least one position in which the
panel lies substantially flush with the framed, the through opening being on opening which

extends entirely through the base from the exterior to the interior of the compact. 
A compact as claimed in claim 1, wherein the panel has opposed major
faces and is shaped and dimensioned to be received within the through

opening in substantially flush relation to the frame, one of the major faces of
the panel being formed as a tray for holding material to be contained in the

compact; and wherein the frame and one of the major faces of the panel are
exposed to the exterior of the compact when the compact is closed.
A compact as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the base member
includes means for retaining the panel in said one position relative to the

frame.
A compact as claimed in claim 3, wherein the retaining means
comprises a projection on one of the frame and the panel and a portion of the

other of the frame and the panel shaped and positioned to engage the
projection when the panel is in said one position relative to the frame.
A compact as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 4, wherein the panel is
shaped and dimensioned to be rotatable about the axis, relative to the frame,

through at least 180°, between said one position and a second position, in
which second position the panel lies substantially flush with the frame and the

other of said major faces is exposed to the exterior of the compact when the
compact is closed. 
A compact as claimed in claim 5, wherein the retaining means
comprises means for releasably holding the panel in each of said one

position and said second position relative to the frame.
A compact as claimed in claim 6 or claim 7, wherein in said one
position the tray is oriented toward the interior of the compact and in said

second position the tray is exposed to the exterior of the compact, the
compact being closable when the panel is in either of said positions.
A compact as claimed in any previous claim, wherein the cover
member also comprises a frame and a panel as defined in any previous claim

but wherein instead of being formed as a tray the panel of the cover member
bears a mirror.
