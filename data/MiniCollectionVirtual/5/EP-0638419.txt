<CLAIMS>
A supporting framework for a roller rotary printing machine, comprising at least
one printing unit (5) which is accommodated in the supporting framework and is

formed by a roll element (6) having a plurality of rolls (7, 8, 9) and by inking
and wetting units (11, 15) associated with the roll element (6), the roll element

(6) and the inking and wetting units (11, 15) being supported in the supporting
framework (2) on fixed uprights (30) of the supporting framework (2), the

supporting framework (2) being stable in a load-bearing manner, at least when
firmly connected to the roll element (6), and at least parts of the inking unit and

of the wetting unit (11, 15) being combined to form modular units,

characterised in that
 the modular units can be moved in a straight line in the
direction of the axes of rotation (21) of the rolls (7, 8, 9) opposite the roll

element (6) between a working position and a maintenance position, so that a
correspondingly exposed part of the roll element (6) is accessible for

maintenance work.
A supporting framework as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that
, in the
supporting framework (2), the entire roll element (6) can be moved in the

direction of the axes of rotation (21) of the rolls (7, 8, 9) as a modular unit (10;
6).
A supporting framework as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 at least parts of the wetting unit (15) co-operating with the
inking unit (11) are combined with the movable parts of the inking unit (11) to

form the modular unit (10). 
A supporting framework as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised in that
 entire
inking and wetting units (11,15) each form a movable modular unit (10).
A supporting framework as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the supporting framework (2) is provided with runners (19)
on which the modular unit (10) is movably held in a suspended or resting

manner.
A supporting framework as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the roll element (6) is provided with runners (19) on which
the modular unit (10) is movably held in a suspended or resting manner.
A supporting framework as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the movable modular unit (10) has its own drive.
A supporting framework as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the movable modular unit (10) has its own control
mechanism.
A supporting framework as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the movable modular unit (10) has its own travel drive.
A supporting framework as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the movable modular unit (10) can be supplied via trailing
cables.
A supporting framework as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the movable modular unit (10) can be supplied via a plug-type
connector (21). 
A supporting framework as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the uprights (30) are precision-machined only in the regions
for holding the roll elements (6) and the inking and wetting units (11, 15).
A supporting framework as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the supporting framework (2) is extended in the direction in
which the modular unit (10) is moved out, in order to accommodate the moved-out

modular unit (10).
A supporting framework as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the supporting framework (2) is provided with movable
operating platforms (35).
A supporting framework as claimed in claim 14, 
characterised in that
 the
operating platforms (35) can each be moved under moved-out modular units

(10).
A supporting framework as claimed in claim 14 or 15, 
characterised in that
 the
operating platforms (35) can each be moved above moved-out modular units

(10).
A supporting framework for a roller rotary printing machine, comprising a
printing tower which is accommodated in the supporting framework, the

printing tower consisting of at least one printing unit (5), which is formed by a
roll element (6) having a plurality of rolls (7, 8, 9) and by inking and wetting

units (11, 15) associated with the roll element (6), a folding device (3), which is
formed by rotatable cutting and folding rolls, and a printing stock roller frame

(4), which is formed by at least one printing stock roller seating, the elements (6,
11, 15) that form the printing unit (5), the main parts that form the folding

device (3), and the main parts that form the printing stock roller frame (4) being 
held in the supporting framework (2), which is stable in a load-bearing manner,

at least when firmly connected to the elements (6, 11, 15) that form the printing

unit (5), and at least parts of the inking and wetting units (11, 15) being
combined to form modular units (10), 
characterised in that
 the modular units
can be moved in a straight line in the direction of the axes of rotation (21) of the

rolls (7, 8, 9) opposite the roll element (6) between a working position and a
maintenance position, so that a correspondingly exposed part of the roll element

(6) is accessible for maintenance work.
