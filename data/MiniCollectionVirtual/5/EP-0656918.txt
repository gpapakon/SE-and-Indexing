<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed herein a process for preparing an oriented polyethylene terephthalate article, by (a) surface treating the article to obtain good adhesive bonding by increasing the concentration of surface polar groups, and then (b) contacting the treated surface with suitable solvent that preserves the good adhesive bonding characteristics but removes undesirable blocking characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLEPROCESS FOR SURFACE TREATMENT OF POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHAUTE ARTICLEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPolyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been demonstrated as an effective polymer for a wide variety of products. Its properties of strength, durability and the like make it suitable for any number of applications, from filaments and fibers to beverage containers. The preparation of polymeric linear terephthalic esters is disclosed in U.S. 2,465,319 and is incorporated by reference herein. In general this preparation involves the condensation of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.Many uses of polyethylene terephthalate are derived from the film form. Films are prepared by any number of techniques well known to the practitioner, including extrusion. Moreover if the polyethylene terephthalate film is olecularly oriented, certain physical properties such as tensile strength, impact strength, flex life, water vapor, and organic vapor permeability and tensile modulus are enhanced. U.S. 2,823,421 which is incorporated by reference herein, is directed to the stretching of polyethylene terephthalate film to produce an oriented product having an outstanding combination of physical, chemical and electrical properties. An extruded, molten, amorphous film of polyethylene terephthalate is continuously longitudinally stretched at least at the rate of 400 percent per minute no greater than 3.25 times at a temperature of between 80-90째C. The longitudinally stretched film is preheated at between 90-95째C and continuously transversely stretched substantially the same amount of at least 400 percent per minute at a temperature of 90-110째C to 

produce a balanced film. The biaxially stretched film is thereafter heat-set at a temperature within the range 150-250째C.Oriented polyethylene terephthalate is widely used in a variety of industries including electronics (as dielectrics, coverings, and the like), the wire and cable industry (as for example filaments and protective sheaths), fibers, and polymeric articles of manufacture (such as beverage containers) , to name a few. It finds particular application in the medical device field, including medical dilatation products where strength is a critical property. For example, U.S. Re 33,561 relates to balloon catheters especially useful in medical dilatation procedures, and is incorporated by reference herein. This patent provides for balloon catheters useful for the relief of arterial stenosis and other ailments requiring a surgical procedure involving insertion of an instrument

(a) treating an article on the surface thereof and subsequently
(b) contacting the surface thereof with solvent. 2. The process of Claim 1 wherein the article of oriented polyethylene .terephthalate has an initial polarity associated therewith, and the surface treatment
(a) increases the polarity and further the solvent contact (b) decreases the polarity resulting from (a) , so that the polarity of the polyethylene terephthalate after the surface treatment (a) and the solvent contact
(b) is increased relative to the initial polarity.
3. The process of Claim 1 wherein the surface treatment (a) is selected from the group consisting of electrical stress accompanied by corona treatment, plasma treatment, flame treatment, ultraviolet light treatment, and chemical treatment.
4. The process of Claim 3 wherein the surface treatment (a) is plasma treatment . 5. The process, of Claim 4 wherein plasma treatment is conducted for less than about 16 minutes and at less than about 300 watts.
6. The process of Claim 1 wherein the solvent in (b) is selected from the group consisting of ketones, alcohols, and esters having from 3 to 12 carbons, amides having from 2 to 12 carbons, chloroform, and carbon disulphide.

isopropanol, acetone, carbon disulphide, chloroform, cyclohexanol, and formamide.
8. The process of Claim 1 wherein the polyethylene terephthalate is biaxially oriented. 9. The process of Claim 8 wherein solvent contact (b) further comprises contacting the biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate with acetone for a period of at least about 1 minute, at ambient temperature.
10. The process of Claim 9 wherein solvent contact (b) further comprises contacting the biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate with acetone for a period of from about 60 minutes to about 120 minutes, at ambient temperature.
11. The process of Claim 1 wherein substantially all of the solvent in (b) is removed after contact with the surface of the article.
12. A process for the preparation of an article of polyethylene terephthalate exhibiting low self-adhesion and high bondability to other surfaces, compxising: (a) forming an article of biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate, said article having a ratio of a polar surface tension to a dispersive surface tension of about 0.25;
(b) treating said article on a surface thereof by exposure to an ionizing energy source such that the ratio of the polar surface tension to the dispersive surface tension is greater than about 0.7;
(c) contacting said article after treatment (b) with a solvent such that the ratio is decreased from the ratio of (b) and increased from the ratio of (a) ; and
(d) removing substantially all of said solvent of (c) .
