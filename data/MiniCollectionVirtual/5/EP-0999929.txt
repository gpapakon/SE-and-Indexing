<ABSTRACT>
An extruder of the Tranfermix type comprises a barrel (2) in which a screw (1) rotates for transporting and mixing visco-elastic compounds. The extruder has an inlet, a compression section, a plasticizing section and an exit section. The plasticizing section is of the Transfermix type, in which a helical groove (3) in the screw (1) varies in cross section from full area to zero area, while the cross section of an oppositely handed helical groove (4) in the barrel (2) varies from zero area to full area. A return section (5) follows the plasticizing section, and the operative contact surface of the return section (5) is formed by a sleeve (7) which forms a cylindrical gap (8) between the sleeve (7) and the screw (1), the sleeve (7) being axially movable to close or open the gap to produce a continuously adjustable throttle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to continuously operating mixers and extruders for
flowable media mainly, but not exclusively, of the visco-elastic kind,
having an inlet, an outlet and between these at least a mixing/plasticising
section of the Transfermix type.GB-A-842 692 shows a Transfermix section, relating particularly to
mixers and extruders comprising a driven rotor and a stator having
respectively an internal and an external helical groove, the grooves being
coaxial but of opposite hand and the helical groove in the one component,
e.g. the rotor, varying from a full flow cross-section to zero cross-section
over the axial length of one Transfermix section while the helical groove
in the other component, e.g. the barrel, varies from zero cross-section to
full cross-section over substantially the same axial length, and vice versa
in a possibly following Transfermix return section. In operation, the
material being transported initially in the one component at the entry to
the Transfermix section is transferred layer-by-layer from this as the
giver-component to the other as the taker-component until by the end of a
Transfermix section it will have been transferred, mixed and worked
layer by layer in an orderly sequence.A Transfermix section provides the property that throttling of the flow
material changes the intensity with which the throughput is being
influenced, more particularly the mechanical work input, in any case
uniformly but to a degree of uniformity which depends upon the
geometrical design of the Transfermix section. A first generation of Transfermix is described in GB-A- 842 692, while
GB-A- 1 585 531and 1 585 532 show a second generation with multiple
grooves, and EP-B-0 574 172 shows a third generation with longitudinal
mixing.In extruders or mixers having the function of shaping an extrudate
through a die at the end of the outlet-section, the amount that the medium
is throttled is predetermined by the cross-sectional shape, form and
length of its flow-channel. However, the concern of this invention is with
additional throttles for influencing the amount of work input into the
medium generally and compensating for different throttle-effects
inherent in different dies that may be used, in order to obtain a required
quality in the first place and the same quality of the extrudate out of
different dies, in the second place. Throttling devices could also be
formed by screens situated at the outlet end of the screw, if required for
the removal of particulate impurities from the extrudate, but

<CLAIMS>
An extruder for visco-elastic compounds comprising a barrel (2) in
which a screw (1) is rotatably mounted and driven to coact with the barrel

(2), the extruder comprising successively an inlet for material to be
extruded, a compression section, a plasticising section and an exit

section, the said plasticising section embodying a Transfermix geometry
in which a helical groove (3) in the screw (1) varies in cross-section from

full area to zero area and in a substantially corresponding length of the
barrel (2) the cross section of the oppositely handed helical groove (4)

varies from zero area to full area, whereby in operation the material is
transferred from the screw (1) into the barrel (2) while being mixed and

plasticised, and in which following said plasticising section is a return
section (5) of which the internal diameter of the operative contact-surface

(6) for the material in the barrel (2) is reduced from that corresponding to
the greatest depth of the barrel groove (4) to one having substantially a

running clearance to the outside diameter of the screw (1) and the helical
groove in the screw varies in cross-sectional area from zero to full depth;


characterized in that
 a sleeve (7) of at least partially cylindrical shape and
having substantially the radial thickness of the maximum depth of said

barrel groove (4) forms the operative contact-surface (6) of the return
section (5) in the barrel (2), the said sleeve (7) being mounted in said

barrel (2) so as to form a substantially cylindrical gap (8) between the
innermost edge (9) of the operative contact-surface (6) of said sleeve and

a diametral edge (10) of the screw (1) at which the depth of the helical
groove (3) thereon is substantially zero, the side sleeve (7) being mounted

in the said barrel by means adapted to prevent rotation thereof and by
means for axially displacing the said sleeve (7) as to close or open the 

said gap (8) to produce a continuously adjustable throttling effect between
substantially fully open and fully closed.
An extruder according to claim 1, in which the said operating
contact surface (6) of the said sleeve (7) is provided with a groove (11) of

the same hand as the helical groove (4) in said barrel in the plasticising
section.
An extruder according to claim 2, in which the said helical groove
(11) in the said sleeve has a lesser number of starts than the barrel groove

(4) in the plasticising section.
An extruder according to claim 3, in which the threads (12)
forming the sides of the said groove (11) in the sleeve (7) project

backwards against the axial direction of flow, by a length equal to the
maximum width of the said gap (8) whereby with the gap fully open the

said threads (12) form in coaction with the barrel surface the said helical
groove (11) also within the gap.
An extruder according to claim 4, in which threads (13) which in
part form the groove (4) in the plasticising section of the barrel and which

correspond in position axially to the threads (12) of the sleeve (7) are
shortened in the axial direction by an amount equal to the projection of

the sleeve threads (12) whereas threads (14) which also in part form
groove (4) and which do not so correspond are not shortened.
An extruder according to any of the preceding claims, in which a
space (18) in the cylindrical barrel wall which opens upon the sleeve (7)

being axially moved from its fully open position is closed against ingress
of the material by a thin cylindrical overlap sleeve (15), having an 

internal diameter equal to that of the barrel surface and an external
cylindrical surface (16) which is supported on both axial sides of the said

space (18) against the pressure of the said material and which when the
sleeve (7) is fully open is substantially flush with the interior surface of

the barrel.
An extruder according to claim 6, in which corresponding edges
(19) of the said sleeve (7) and of the said thin overlap sleeve (15) are

bevelled to further the squeezing out of a thin layer of the material when
the gap (8) is being opened and when said gap is fully open, to form a

ring slot (19) which, with a visco elastic material having cohesion, is
swept out by the lands (17) of the screw also when feeding has stopped.
An extruder according to any preceding claim, in which the length
of the return section (5) is of the order of the maximum depth of either

the helical groove (3) in the screw or that (4) in the barrel
