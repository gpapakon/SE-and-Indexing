<ABSTRACT>
The mirror housing (20) of the automobile sideview mirror (10) is of 
an ordinary 

shell type and so formed at the lower edge (21) of the front 
opening (20a) thereof as to 

have a generally V-shaped section (23) of which the front arm of the 
letter "V" 

protrudes outwardly and is followed by a portion (25) bent at the end of 
the front 

arm and extending almost horizontally and inwardly of the mirror 
housing (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sideview mirror comprising a 
mirror, a mirror holder, a means of supporting the mirror 
holder tiltably and a shell-type mirror housing which houses 
the mirror holder and the supporting means, the mirror housing 
having at least a front opening. Ordinary sideview mirrors of automobiles have a mirror housing 
designed in the form of a shell in order to minimize the air resistance to the 
mirror when the automobile is running. When a car having such a 
conventional shell-type sideview mirror runs at a speed as high as 150 km/h or 
more, an eddy flow of air is likely to take place near the front opening of the 
mirror housing, possibly causing a whizzing, the mirror to vibrate or a dust or 
dirt whirled in an air flow from the road surface to enter and heap in the 
mirror housing through the front opening thereof. Any of the whizzing, 
mirror vibration and the dust heaping in the mirror housing, caused by such a 
turbulent flow will apparently be an inconvenience to the safety in a car driving 
at a speed higher than 150 km/h. Therefore, it is demanded at present to 
provide a sideview mirror having a mirror housing designed to meet the 
aerodynamic requirements in order to solve such problem. Mirror housings having various esthetically improved outer 
configurations have so far been proposed to meet a variety of needs from the 
consumers. However, the above-mentioned aerodynamic requirements have 
not yet been met but still limit the designs of the outer configuration of the 
mirror housing, proposed to meet such consumers' needs. A sideview mirror as defined in the opening statement is known 
by the applicant. Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to overcome 
the above-mentioned drawback of the prior art by providing a 
side mirror having an improved mirror housing which meets the 
aerodynamic requirements at high speed and allows various 
configurations in respect of the design.  
 This object is accomplished with a sideview mirror as defined 
in the opening statement wherein the mirror housing has a 
portion thereof so swelled outwardly near and at the lower edge 
of the front opening as to have a V-shaped section with a front 
arm portion of the V-shaped section being contiguous to a 
portion which extends almost horizontally and inwardly into the 
mirror housing. In other words, the lower portion near the 
lower edge of the front opening is formed to have a generally 
V-shaped section of which the front arm of the letter "V" 
extends outwardly of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A side view mirror comprising: 

a mirror (12), 
a mirror holder (14), 
a means of supporting the mirror holder (14) tiltably, 
and 
a shell-type mirror housing (20) which houses the mirror 
holder (14) and the supporting means, the mirror housing 

(20) having at least a front opening (20a),
characterized in that
the mirror housing (20) has a portion (23) thereof so 
swelled outwardly near and at the lower edge (21) of the 

front opening (20a) as to have a V-shaped section with a 
front arm portion of the V-shaped section being 

contiguous to a portion (25) which extends almost 
horizontally and inwardly into the mirror housing (12). 
Side view mirror, according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the means tiltably holding the mirror holder (14) 
comprise: 


a drive unit (24) which is housed in the shell-type 
mirror housing (20) to support the mirror holder (14) 

tiltably, and 
a means of operatively coupling a pair of plungers (18) 
to the mirror holder (14); 
the side view mirror further comprises a mechanism which 
enables the mirror housing (12) to be folded forwards 

and backwards; 
and the shape of the front opening (28) of the housing 
(20) generally corresponds to the outer configuration of 

the mirror (12). 
Side-view mirror, according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 the horizontally extending portion 
(25) has the same thickness as the V-sectional portion 

(23). 
Side-view mirror, according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 the space (S) defined between the 
V-sectional portion (23) and the horizontally extending 

portion (25) is open in the direction of a lateral 
opening (20b) of the mirror housing (20).
