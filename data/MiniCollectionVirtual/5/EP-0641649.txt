<ABSTRACT>
In a process, to strip the stencil coating on stencil carriers of screen printing formes, above all of rotary printing formes, the stencil coating is removed from the stencil carrier under the effect of a liquid. In order that the removal of the stencil coating from screen printing formes can be carried out without using media which are difficult to dispose of, a liquid jet (49) is directed onto the stencil carrier (23) at an impact pressure which is sufficient for the mechanical or hydraulic removal, and the stencil coating is removed progressively by relative movement between the liquid jet (49) and the stencil carrier (23), said stencil carrier (23) being supported on the side facing away from the liquid jet (49), at least in the impact region thereof.
