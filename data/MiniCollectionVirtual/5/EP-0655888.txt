 PRODUCTION OF HUMAN HEMOGLOBIN IN TRANSGENIC PIGS*5 1. INTRODUCTIONThe present invention relates to the use of transgenic pigs -for the production of human hemoglobin. -The transgenic pigs of the invention may be used as an e ficient and economical source of cell- 20 free human- hemoglobin that may be used for transfusions and other medical applications in humans.2.ι BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION ..-• 2.1. HEMOGLOBIN15 ■_ . < , < > Oxygen absorbed through the lungs is carried by hemoglobin inured blood cells for delivery to tissues throughout 'the body. At high oxygen tensions, such as those- found in >the proximity of the lungs, oxygen, binds to hemoglobin, but is released in areas20 of J°w oxygen tension, where it is needed.Each .hemoglobin molecule consists of two alpha globin and "two beta globin subunits. Each subunit, Jn turn., is noncovalently associated with an iron-containing.>heme group capable of carrying an25 oxygen molecule. Thus, each hemoglobin tetramer is capable of binding four molecules of oxygen. The subunits work together in switching between two conformational states to facilitate uptake and release of oxygen at the lungs and tissues, respectively.30 This effect is commonly referred to as heme-he e interaction or cooperativity.The hemoglobins of many animals are able to interact with biologic effector molecules that can further enhance oxygen binding and release. This35 enhancement is manifested in changes which affect the allosteric equilibrium between the two conformational states of hemoglobin. For example, human and pig hemoglobin can bind 2, 3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3 DPG) , 

 which influences the equilibrium between the two conformational states of the tetramer and has the net, effect o£ powering the overall affinity for oxygen at 5. the, tissue level. , As a result, 2,3-DPG increases the efficiency. of oxygen delivery to the tissues.t _ 2.2. GLOBIN GENE EXPRESSION ., -,, Hemoglobin protein is expressed in a tissue 0sP^?ifip manner in red blood cells where it accounts for sgproximately ninety percent of total cellular protean. Thus, red blood cells, which have lost their nucJeus and all but a minimal number of organelles, arp effectively membrane-enclosed packets of 5_ heppgjqbinι dedicated to oxygen transfer. „ , , ι , Humans and various other species produce^ different types of hemoglobin during embryonic, fetal, and adult developmental periods. Therefore, the factory that influence globin gene expression must be 0 able to achieve tissue specific control, quantitative
