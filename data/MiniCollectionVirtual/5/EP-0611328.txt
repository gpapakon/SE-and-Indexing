<DESCRIPTION>
 HYBRID CENTRIFUGE SAMPLE CONTAINER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Scope of the Invention The present invention relates to centrifugation, and in particular, to a composite centrifuge container for supporting sample in a centrifuge rotor.2. Description of Related ArtIn the past, centrifuge containers or adapters, for supporting sample carriers in a centrifuge rotor, have been machined from metal using conventional metal working processes. Even thin walled containers can constitute a significant percentage of the total weight of a centrifuge rotor. This imposes additional forces on the load bearing surfaces of the rotor which in turn must be reinforced. In addition, a heavy container translates to additional centrifugal forces on the rotor. This reduces the maximum safe operating speed of the rotor as its critical stress will be approached at lower speed. In terms of customer convenience, it is preferred that the weight of centrifuge containers be kept light. The present invention makes use of composite technology to produce structurally superior centrifuge containers which offer significant weight reduction. 

 STJMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to a hybrid composite sample holder or container to improve overall strength-to-weight of the rotor. The container has a base which comprises a metal neck and a fiber composite portion integrally attached. The metal neck can be machined for close tolerance coupling with a closure means of the container.

CLAIMS .
1. A centrifuge rotor having a body in which cavities are defined for receiving containers for. supporting samples for centrifugation, the containers each having a base characterized by a hybrid structure of metal and fiber reinforced material.
2. A centrifuge container-for supporting a sample for centrifugation characterized by: a fiber reinforced base; and a metal neck coupled to the fiber reinforced base.
3. A hybrid centrifuge container as in claim 2 wherein the metal neck is molded to the fiber reinforced base.
4. A hybrid centrifuge container as in claim 3 wherein the metal neck is provide with an annular channel which when molded to the fiber reinforce base form an interlocking structure.
5. A hybrid centrifuge container as in claims 2 or 4 wherein the metal neck is machined to accept a threaded closure.
6. A hybrid centrifuge container as in any one of claims 2 to 5 wherein the fiber reinforced base comprises several layers of fiber material wherein fibers in adjacent layers are oriented in different directions.
7. A method for making a hybrid centrifuge container for supporting a sample for centrifugation characterized by the steps of: 


 providing a mandrel having an external shape conforming to the internal shape of the container; wrapping fibers around the mandrel to form a dry fiber preform; slipping a metal sleeve around at least a portion of the dry fiber preform; molding resin material onto the dry fiber preform to form a fiber reinforced base of the container; and curing the resin material whereby the metal sleeve is interlocked to the base forming an integral neck to the base.
8. A method as in claim 7 wherein the wrapping step comprises wrapping several layers of fibers whereby the fibers in adjacent layers are oriented at different directions.
