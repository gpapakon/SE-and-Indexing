<ABSTRACT>
A cut sheet feeder (1) for use with an image forming 
apparatus (2), comprising: a sheet feed mechanism (3) for picking 

up stacked cut sheets (68) one at a time from a predetermined 
position and for feeding each sheet (68) to an image recording 

portion; a sheet feed unit (10) vertically movable relative to the 
sheet feed mechanism (3); a first sheet feed table (12) located 

above the sheet feed unit (10) and including a cutout portion (14) 
for avoiding interference with the sheet feed mechanism (3) when 

the first sheet feed table (12) moves vertically in combination 
with the sheet feed unit (10); and a second sheet feed table (50) 

located in a lower part of the sheet feed unit (10) and vertically 
movable relative to the sheet feed unit (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cut sheet feeder
for use with the image forming apparatus such as a copier
or a printer, the feeder feeding the apparatus with cut
sheets of recording paper.PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 12, No. 432 (M-763) 15
November 1988 and JP-A-63 165 255 describe a paper feeding
device which simplifies the structure of a driving system
by providing a paper feeding means which selectively
enables both cassette feeding and manual feeding by the use
of one roller, or the paper feeding opening part of a
picture image forming device body, in an electronic copying
machine, etc.US-A-4,108,427 discloses a feeding device which
comprises a plurality of cassettes capable of supporting
thereon copy mediums, a cassette cradle for holding the
cassettes in an operatively associated relationship with
one another, feed means for feeding the copy mediums,
control means for controlling the feed means to
intermittently feed the copy mediums, and means for 
selectively displacing the cassette cradle to at least two
positions to selectively locate at least one of the
cassettes at a position where it may be acted on by the
feed means, whereby copy mediums may be fed from one of the
cassettes.The image forming apparatus is most often used to
record images on a large number of cut sheets of the same
size which are fed continuously (e.g., from a sheet feed
table for bulk printing). But occasionally, it is
desired to interrupt the ongoing process of image
printing involving many cut sheets so as to insert image
printing of a different kind typically on a smaller
number of sheets (fed typically from a cassette). Some
of the conventional cut sheet feeders for use with the
image forming apparatus have mechanisms that meet the
requirements for the on-demand inserted printing.Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) are perspective views showing
a conventional image forming apparatus equipped with a
cut sheet feeder capable of feeding sheets from either a
sheet feed table or from a cassette. In the figures, the 
cut sheet feeder 91 is attached to one side of the image
forming apparatus 90. The cut sheet feeder 91 comprises
a frame 92 mounted retractably from the feeder body 91a,
pick-up rollers 93 attached to a top side of the frame
92, a sheet feed table 95 which moves up and down inside
the frame 92 and which has a large number of cut sheets
94 stacked thereon, and a sheet guide 96 adjustable in
the longitudinal direction of the cut sheets 94 on the
sheet feed table 95. Distinct from the cut sheet feeder
91, cassettes 97 are

<CLAIMS>
A cut sheet feeder for use with an image forming
apparatus, comprising:


a sheet feed mechanism for picking up stacked cut
sheets one at a time from a predetermined position and for

feeding each sheet to an image recording portion;
characterized by including:


a sheet feed unit vertically movable relative to
said sheet feed mechnism;
a first sheet feed table (12) located in an upper part
of said sheet feed unit and including a cutout portion for

avoiding interference with said sheet feed mechanism when
said first sheet feed table moves vertically in combination

with said sheet feed unit; and
a second sheet feed table (50) located in a lower part

of said sheet feed unit and vertically movable relative to
said sheet feed unit.
A cut sheet feeder as claimed in claim 1 in which
the first sheet feed table is a cassette plate which

accommodates detachably a cassette containing cut sheets.
A cut sheet feeder as claimed in claim 2 in which
the second sheet feed table accommodates more cut sheets

than said cassette. 
A cut sheet feeder according to claim 2 or 3,
wherein the position of said second sheet feed table is

horizontally adjustable.
A cut sheet feeder according to claim 4,
comprising: an operation part disposed on said sheet feed

unit, said operation part being used to adjust the
horizontal position of said second sheet feed table,

   a cover employed to cover said operation part
when cut sheets are fed from said cassette plate and to

expose said operation part when cut sheets are fed from
said second sheet feed table.
A cut sheet feeder as claimed in any preceding
claim and including:


a pair of fences furnished inside said sheet feed
unit for aligning the edge positions of the cut sheets

placed on said second sheet feed table.
A cut sheet feeder as claimed in any preceding
claim in which the first sheet feed table accommodates

detachably and on top thereof a cassette containing cut
sheets. 
A cut sheet feeder as claimed in any preceding
claim in which the second sheet feed table accommodates cut

sheets on top thereof, and includes:

a pair of fences attached to said sheet feed unit
in a positionally adjustable manner depending on the size

of the cut sheets placed on said second sheet feed table,
said fences aligning the edge positions of said cut sheets.
