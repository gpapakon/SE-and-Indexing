<ABSTRACT>
In a co- and counter-pumped optically pumped optical amplifier 
configuration using two lasers (10a, 10b) as the pumps, the 

possibility of the formation of a coupled laser cavity is pre-empted by 
embedding a signal/pump wavelength multiplexing coupler (21c) in 

the amplifier fibre (22a, 22b).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical amplifiers employing optically 
pumped optically amplifying waveguide, typically optically amplifying 
optical fibre. One of the known types of optical amplifier fibre is 
erbium doped optical fibre, and it is known that this can be pumped 
at 1480 nm, and at 980 nm, using injection laser diode pumps. When pumping at 1480 nm, it is known to use a dual pump 
configuration in which one pump laser is coupled to one end of the 
amplifier fibre by means of a pump/signal wavelength multiplexing 2 
x 2 coupler in co-pumping configuration, while the other pump laser 
is similarly coupled to the other end in counter-pumping 
configuration. Such a configuration is for instance described as a 
prior art configuration in GB 2 253 514A. For a number of 
applications it would be preferable to arrange to pump at 980 nm 
instead of 1480 nm. This may for instance be because of the 
greater electrical to optical conversion efficiency of amplifiers 
pumped at the shorter wavelength. A difficulty is however found in 
transferring the dual pump configuration, which has proved 
satisfactory in a system designed for pumping at 1480 nm, directly 
into a system designed for pumping at 980 nm. The present invention is directed to overcoming this difficulty. According to the present invention there is provided an optical 
amplifier including a length of optical amplifier waveguide whose 
two ends are respectively coupled by first and second pump/signal  
 
wavelength multiplexing 2 x 2 couplers with first and second optical 
pump lasers respectively in co-pumping and counter-pumping 
configuration, characterised in that said amplifier waveguide is 
divided into two portions optically coupled by a third pump/signal 
wavelength multiplexing 2 x 2 coupler. There follows a description of an optical amplifier embodying the 
invention in a preferred form. This description is prefaced with 
further description of a prior art optical amplifier in order to set the 
invention in context. The description refers to the accompanying 
drawings in which 
Figure 1 is a diagram of a prior art amplifier, and Figure 2 is a diagram of an amplifier embodying the present 
invention. Referring first to Figure 1, a prior art form of dual pumped erbium 
doped optical amplifier designed for operation with pumping at 
1480 nm has two injection laser diode pumps 10a and 10b, two 
pump/signal wavelength multiplexing 2 x 2 couplers 11a and 11b, a 
length 12 of erbium doped optical amplifier fibre, two optical isolators 
13,
