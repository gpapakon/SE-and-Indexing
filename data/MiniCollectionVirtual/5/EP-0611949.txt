<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an angular velocity
sensor known as a gyroscopic instrument and more particularly,
to a high-performance angular velocity sensor having a
tuning-fork construction where two vibrator units containing
piezoelectric elements are coupled to each other and a
method of fabricating the same.A conventional gyroscopic inertia navigation system
includes mechanical rotor gyros for determining the direction
of a moving object, e.g. an airplane or ship.Such a mechanical gyroscopic system is steady in the
performance but bulky in the size thus increasing the cost
of production and hardly permitting the application to any
small-sized pertinent apparatus.Also, an oscillator-type angular velocity sensor is
known for detecting a "Coriolis force" with its detector
while it is vibrating but not rotating. Such a sensor
commonly employs a piezoelectric or electromagnetic oscillation
mechanism.The detection of an angular velocity in the sensor is
implemented by sensing a vibration torque of a frequency
equal to that of the mass of a gyro which is not rotating
but vibrating at a constant rate. The vibration torque is
known as the Coriolis force generated when an angular velocity 
is involved.The oscillator-type angular velocity sensor can detect
the amplitude of the vibration torque to determine an angular
velocity. Particularly, a variety of the oscillator-type
angular velocity sensors employing piezoelectric elements
have been introduced for example, as depicted in the
Proceeding of Japanese Institute of Aviation and Space,
Vol.23, No.257, pp. 339-350 and JP-A-3/084412.One of the conventional tuning-fork structure oscillator-type
angular velocity sensors will now be described
referring to Figs. 11 to 13. The arrangement of the angular
velocity sensor is best illustrated in Fig. 11 which consists
mainly of four piezoelectric bimorphous elements
serving as an actuator, a monitor, and a first and a second
detectors. The actuator 101 is orthogonally coupled by a
joiner 105 to the first detector 103 constituting a first
vibrator 109 while the monitor 102 is orthogonally coupled
by another joiner 106 to the second detector 104 constituting
a second vibrator 110. The first 109 and the second
vibrators 110 are coupled to each other by a connector 107
which is supported at a point by a support 108, thus constructing
a tuning-fork structure.When the actuator 101 of piezoelectric bimorphous
element is loaded with a sine-wave voltage signal, its
inverse piezoelectric effect causes the first vibrator 109
t
