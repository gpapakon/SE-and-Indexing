<DESCRIPTION>
A FU GICIDALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a DNA sequence encoding an antifungal polypeptide, to an antifungal polypeptide encoded by said DNA sequence, to a microorganism and a method for producing the polypeptide, and to a fungicidal composition comprising the antifungal polypeptide. Furthermore, the pre¬ sent invention relates to the use of the polypeptide or the fungicidal composition in combating or controlling fungal at- tack, especially on plants.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe fungal species A . giganteus is known to produce an anti¬ fungal protein which is a potential fungicidal agent. Olson and Goerner, 1965, describe the production, isolation and chemical composition of one such antifungal protein from a specific strain of A. giganteus .Furthermore, Nakaya et al., 1990 and JP-A—4-234399 disclose the amino acid sequence of an A. giganteus antifungal pro¬ tein, Wnendt et al., 1990 the corresponding cDNA sequence, and WO 91/19738 describes the use of this cDNA sequence in the construction of transgenic plants capable of producing the polypeptide. The production and isolation of the anti¬ fungal polypeptide described in these references are reported to have been accomplished by conventional means, i.e. by fer- mentation of an A. giganteus strain capable of and inherently producing the antifungal polypeptide and subsequent recovery of the polypeptide from the fermented culture.However, the production of the antifungal polypeptide by such procedure is undesirable in that, in general, the yield of antifungal polypeptide is relatively low, and furthermore, in the conventional fermentation, the antifungal polypeptide is 

produced in combination with and in practice inseparable from a cytotoxic, and thus undesirable component termed α-sarcin, which is frequently produced by strains of A . giganteus .Accordingly, it would be desirable to be able to produce antifungal A . giganteus polypeptides in larger amounts and at lower costs than what is possible by the above mentioned conventional fermentation, and further to be able to produce antifungal A . giganteus polypeptides essentially free from undesirable A . giganteus components, and in particular free from α-sarcin.In an abstract from the 23rd Lunteren Lectures, Jacobs et al. report the expression of the antifungal protein in Saccharo- myceε cereviεiae . Only a very low expression (lng/ml) could be obtained.Thus, despite the fact that the amino acid and corresponding cDNA sequences of one antifungal A .
