<ABSTRACT>
A process for repairing an electronic array wafer 
assembly having a short circuit between two non-insulative layers 

(116,113a,113b) 
separated by a dielectric layer (114) includes the step of selectively 

ablating 
one of the non-insulative layers so as to electrically isolate the situs of 

the short circuit while maintaining the electrical integrity of the 

underlying non-insulative layer intact. A laser beam is directed onto 
the non-insulative layer and scanned in a selected pattern to isolate 

the situs of the short circuit; the laser is further controlled such that a 
selected energy density is delivered to the surface to be ablated such 

that the underlying non-insulative layer (113a,113b) is not damaged.

<DESCRIPTION>
Complex electronic devices are commonly formed on
substrates through the deposition and patterning of multiple layers of
conductive, semiconductive, and dielectric materials so as to form
multiple individual electronic components. For example, large area
imager arrays (e.g., having an area of about 200 square centimeters
or more) are commonly fabricated on a wafer and contain
photodiodes and circuitry for reading the output of the photodiodes,
such as address lines and switching components (e.g., thin film
transistors). Defects in such imager arrays can result from, among
other causes, impurities in materials deposited to form the various
components. One example of such an impurity-based defect is an
unwanted conductive path, or short circuit, between two conductive
layers separated by a dielectric layer. Such defects can disrupt the
desired electrical connections between devices in the array and thus
seriously degrade the performance of one or more of the individual
electronic components on the wafer, often to the point of making an
entire wafer unusable. It is thus advantageous to be able to repair
defects in a wafer, either during the fabrication process, or after
completion of the wafer.Repair schemes for wafers often involve having different
making connections to backup address lines incorporated into the
wafer, such as is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,688,896 of
Castleberry, U.S. Patent No. 4,840,459 of Strong, and U.S. Patent No.
5,062,690 of Whetten.
This type of approach is primarily useful in 
repairing shorts between components, such as address lines, that are
substantially disposed horizontally with respect to the other in the
array; this approach is less feasible to use when the defect is a short
circuit between a large conductive layer, such as the transparent
common electrode disposed over the photosensor array, and an
underlying component, such as an address line or photodiode pixel,
separated by a substantially transparent dielectric material. In
particular, such a "vertical" defect (i.e., short circuit or conductive path
between the two layers, disposed one over the other and separated
by a dielectric layer) can occur almost anywhere in the large area
covered by the common electrode. Further, lasers of the type used in
address line repair necessarily are powerful enough to penetrate
deep into the array and thus typically are too powerful to use to ablate
only a portion of the common electrode, which commonly comprises a
transparent conducting oxide (TCO), layer, without damaging the
un
