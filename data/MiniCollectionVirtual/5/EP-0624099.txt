<DESCRIPTION>
 WATER SOLUBLE NON-IMMUNOGENIC POLYAMIDE CROSS-LINKING AGENTSField of the InventionThe present invention relates to covalent binding of water-soluble polyamides to proteins, polynucleotides and other biological substrates to form substantially nonimmunogenic water-soluble products. The present invention also relates to proteins, polynucleotides and other biological substrates which are cross-linked, conjugated, polymerized or decorated with water-soluble polyamides to form substantially nonimmunogenic products.Background of the InventionCross-linking reagents are used for a variety of purposes, including the investigation of the spatial arrangement and functions of various ipacromolecular entities, the identification of binding sites (receptors) for ligands, the preparation of affinity matrices, and the modification and stabilization of diverse macromolecular structures (Methods in Enzymology, Volume 91, pages 580 to 609 (1983)). Cross-linkers have been designed to preserve electrostatic charge; to alter electrostatic charge; to decrease immunogenicity; to increase and decrease susceptibility to proteolysis; to introduce fluorescent labels, spin labels, radiolabels, and electron-dense substituents; to attach several different types of carbohydrate moieties; to modify enzyme specificity; and to introduce intramolecular and/or intermolecular cross-links, both to couple already associated species and to join various proteins in order to combine the properties of both into a single molecule (G. E. Means and R. E. Feeney, Bioconjugate Chemistry, Volume 1, page 2 to 12 (1990)). A large number of cross-linking reagents have been developed to serve these and a variety of other purposes. Many of these reagents are commercially available.Cross-linking of proteins and their immobilization, either by attachment to an insoluble support or by various other means, has been employed to increase the stability of proteins or of certain conformational 

 relationships in proteins; to couple two or more different proteins; to identify or characterize the nature and extent of certain protein-protein interactions or to determine distances between reactive groups in or between protein subunits. Proteins may be immobilized to facilitate their use and their separation from other products. Cross-linking therapeutic proteins or polypeptides has been shown to decrease immunogenicity and to increase the lifetime of the cross-linked product in the blood stream.In general, cross-linking agents consist of an organic bridge between
