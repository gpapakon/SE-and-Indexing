<ABSTRACT>
A clipless bicycle pedal employing a clamping mechanism 
which engages a binding plate (70) on the bottom of a rider's shoe. 

The clamping mechanism includes two units (38, 40) which pivot about the 
same axis to engage the binding plate and which may share a 

biasing mechanism. The pivot axis maybe the same axis as the 
pedal shaft (12). The overall structure of the preferred embodiment 

provides a clipless pedal which is lightweight and easy to 
assembly and maintain.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to bicycle pedals and 
components. More particularly, the present invention is directed 
to bicycle pedals incorporating binding mechanisms which are used 
with binding plates on a shoe worn by a rider. In order to hold a rider's shoe in position on a bicycle 
pedal, bicycle pedals including toe-clips are employed to grasp 
the front portion of each of the rider's shoes. The toe-clips in 
conjunction with pedals and straps allow both downward and upward 
motion to be transmitted as drive force, however, toe-clips have 
the disadvantage that they do not provide for easy disengagement 
in the event of a fall. Thus, clipless pedals have been 
developed to overcome the disadvantages of pedals having toe-clips. Clipless bicycle pedals use a binding mechanism on the pedal 
to engage a plate on a rider's shoe to hold the shoe in position 
on the pedal. The binding mechanism prevents the shoe from 
slipping off the pedal, while also providing for easy  
 
disengagement when stopping or in the event of a fall. 
Clipless pedals may also provide a positive pedalling 
force during both the upward and downward motions of the 
pedal. Conventional clipless pedals generally include 
a pedal body having a binding mechanism mounted thereon 
to engage said plate. The pedal body is, in turn, 
rotatably mounted on a pedal shaft. The binding 
mechanism includes a retaining claw fixedly mounted to 
said pedal body and a movable claw movably mounted to 
said pedal body and a spring which urges the movable claw 
toward the plate fixed to the bottom of the rider's shoe. 
The binding mechanism and said plate are designed to 
cooperate with each other so that a horizontal twisting 
or sliding movement of said plate produces a movement of 
the movable claw, permitting disengagement of said plate. German Gebrauchmuster No. 93 00 261.0, which 
corresponds to the preamble of claim 1, discloses a 
bicycle pedal which enables the engagement and  
 
disengagement of a rider's shoe at two positions. A 
clamping means is provided at each of those positions, 
and comprises a threaded axle, a hooked plate arranged 
to rotate about that axle and a plate spring to bias the 
hooked plate to engage the rider's shoe. Due to the particular arrangement of the engaging and 
clamping means on the pedal body of these prior art pedals, 
engagement and/or disengagement of the rider's shoe can be 
sometimes difficult. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a clipless bicycle pedal 
which facilitates
