<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns herbicidal compounds based on industrial benzene sulphonyl carbamide and 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid and used to control unwanted vegetation by treating the vegetation itself and the soil in which it grows. To counteract the adverse effects on crop rotation by reducing the standard dose and broadening the spectrum of action of the herbicides it is proposed that the herbicide used should be a mixture of ammonium salts of industrial benzene sulphonyl carbamide, 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid and additives. Treatment of the soil and vegetation is carried out using an aqueous solution of the claimed herbicidal compound, the dosage being 50-500 g. of the herbicide per hectare.
