<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst composition having high epoxidation activity 
and resistant to leaching of its metal comprises molybdenum, 

vanadium, tungsten and/or titanium complexed to an organic or 
inorganic support through the intermediacy of an imidazole ligand. 

The catalyst may be used in epoxidation of olefinic compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyst and process for the epoxidation of
olefinic compounds.Epoxidation of olefinic compounds is a well known process which is
operated industrially. For example the epoxidation of propylene to propylene
oxide using alkyl hydroperoxide is known to be catalysed by a soluble
molybdenum catalyst and by a heterogeneous titanium/silica catalyst.Sherrington and Simpson describe in Journal of Catalysis 131 115-126
(1991) polymer-supported molybdenum and vanadium cyclohexene epoxidation
catalysts in which the metals are bound through a hydroxypropylated
aminomethylpyridine ligand.US 4800188 discloses a catalyst composition comprising a transition metal
complexed to a metalloporphyrin through a benzimidazole article. Such
complexes may be used in the selective oxidation of alkanes, olefins and aromatic
compounds and for epoxidation of cyclohexenes.However, there remains a need for an improved heterogeneous epoxidation
catalyst.Thus, according to the present invention there is provided a catalyst
composition comprising molybdenum, vanadium, tungsten and/or titanium
complexed to an organic or inorganic support through the intermediacy of a
pendent imidazole ligand.Also, according to the present invention there is provided a process for the
epoxidation of olefinic compounds which process comprises reacting the olefinic
compound with a peroxide in the presence of a catalyst composition comprising
molybdenum, vanadium, tungsten and/or titanium complexed to an organic or
inorganic support through the intermediacy of a pendent imidazole ligand. The present invention provides a novel catalyst which has high epoxidation
activity and is resistant to leaching of its metal in 
use.The catalyst composition according to the present invention preferably
comprises molybdenum, vanadium and/or tungsten, most preferably molybdenum.
More than one metal may be present in the catalyst composition.The imidazole ligand may comprise unsubstituted imidazole or a
substituted imidazole such as 2-pyridyl-2-imidazole, benzimidazole, 5-benzimidazole
carboxylic acid and hydroxy substituted imidazoles and
benzimidazoles. The imidazole ligand may be attached to the support through any
part of the imidazole or substituted imidazole ligand provided that the imidazole
ring is available for complexing to the metal of the catalyst.Suitably, the ligand loading in the catalyst composition is in the range 0.1
to 5 mmol g-1 preferably 0.25 to 2.5 mmol g-1 and the metal loading in the
catalyst composition is suitably in the
