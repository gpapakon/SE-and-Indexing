<ABSTRACT>
A device for preventing adhesions or binding of tissue to tissue or of tissue to bone which comprises a composite of a first layer and a second layer, each of which comprises a biodegradable polymer. The first layer is selected from the group consisting of a non-porous layer and a porous layer having a pore size no greater than 3 mu . The second layer has pores which have a pore size of from about 30 mu to about 250 mu . Such a composite device provides for tissue growth into the second layer, while the first layer acts as an adhesion-preventing barrier, and enables attachment of the device to tissue without suturing. Alternatively, the device comprises the first layer herein above mentioned and a second layer which is an adherence layer and which adheres to tissue and/or bone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices, such as films, sheets, or
blocks for preventing the adhesion of tissue to tissue or of
tissue to bone. More particularly, this invention relates to
devices, formed from polymeric materials, for preventing tissue
adhesion.In the field of internal medical care, such as internal
surgery, there is a need for tissue regeneration devices which
may prevent complications such as adhesions in the post-operative
healing period. Adhesions which may be formed include the
adhesion of tissue to tissue or of tissue to bone. As generally
known, the occurrence of post-operative adhesion formation after
internal surgery is a major problem in abdominal surgery. For
instance, in gynecological patients adhesion may affect
fertility. As in about 70% of the gynecological abdominal
surgical interventions adhesions do occur, it is evident that
there is a need for a suitable device for preventing the
above-identified adhesions, and the complications and patient
discomfort associated therewith.It has been known to separate adjacent internal bodily
surfaces by interposing a mesh or film so that during tissue
regeneration following surgery no contact exists between the
surfaces. One material which has been employed to prevent adhesions is
an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene material known as Gore-Tex®.
This material, however, is not hemostatic and is non-degradable
by the human body. Thus the implant remains in the body, and, if
necessary, must be removed surgically following the healing
process.Another material is a mesh barrier of carboxymethylcellulose
known as Interceed®. This material, however, may not be applied
in a blood-rich environment as under such circumstances the
material quickly loses its barrier function.Gilding and Reed, in Polymer, Vol. 20 pgs. 1454-1458
(December 1979) and in Polymer, Vol. 22, pgs. 499-504 (April
1981), disclose films formed from poly(ethyleneoxide) and
polyethylene terephthalate, as barrier materials to prevent
surgical adhesions.It is an object of the present invention to provide a device
for preventing the binding of tissue to tissue or of tissue to
bone wherein the device prevents such binding while being
sufficiently pliable as well as providing for growth of tissue,
such as fibrous tissue, into the device.In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there
is provided a device for preventing the binding of tissue to
tissue or of tissue to bone. The term "tissue" as used herein
means tissue other than bone (e.g., fibrous tissue, soft tissue,
muscle
