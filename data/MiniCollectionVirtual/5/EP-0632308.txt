<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
progressive power lens used to assist an 
accommodation power of an eye. In general, when a person reaches his/her 
late forties, an accommodation power of his/her 
eyes becomes week and he/she finds it difficult to 
see a near point clearly. Namely, his/her eyes 
become hyperopic. As spectacles for assisting an 
accommodation power of hyperopic eyes, progressive 
power spectacle lenses (hereinafter referred to as 
the "progressive lenses") have been used widely. 
Such a progressive power lens has a distance vision 
correcting region (referred to as a "portion for 
distance vision" hereinafter), a near vision 
correcting region (referred to as a "portion for near 
vision" hereinafter) and a progressive region 
(referred to as an "intermediate portion" 
hereinafter) located between the above two portions 
in which a refracting power is continuously changed. 
When worn by a user, the portion for distance vision 
becomes an upper portion while the portion for near 
vision becomes an lower portion. In the present  
 
invention, it is to be noted that "upper", "lower", 
"horizontal" and "vertical" are used to point 
positions of the progressive power lens in the state 
that it is actually worn by a user. For example, 
the lower portion of the portion for distance vision 
is a position within the portion for distance vision 
close to the intermediate portion. Fig. 1 shows divisions of regions of a 
progressive power lens formed symmetrically. The 
progressive power lens has a portion F for distance 
vision, a portion N for near vision and an 
intermediate portion P located between those two 
portions F and N in which a refracting power is 
continuously changed. As for the shape of a lens 
surface, the intersecting curve MM'' of the object-side 
lens surface and a cross section along a 
meridian line passing approximately the center of the 
lens surface vertically from top to bottom is used 
as a reference line for expressing specifications 
such as the additional power of the lens, and is also 
used as an important reference line in the lens 
design. In the thus designed progressive power lens, 
the center OF of the portion F for distance vision, 
an eye point E for distance vision and the center 
(eye point) ON of the portion N for near vision are 
located on the center line MM'' as the reference. Further, as shown in Fig. 2, in consideration  
 
of the fact that the portion N for near vision comes 
close to a nasal side when worn by the user, other 
progressive power
