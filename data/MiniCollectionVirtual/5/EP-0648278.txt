<ABSTRACT>
A stable reagent for the assay of an analyte from a fluid sample. The reagent includes an enzyme, a mediator, a tetrazolium salt and an oxidizing agent selected from the group consisting of sodium chlorate, 2,5-dimethylhexane-2,5-dihydroperoxide, benzoyl peroxide, t-butyl peroxide, sodium iodate, N-ethylmaleimide, t-butylperoxyacetate, nickel acetylacetonate, stannic chloride, rhodium (III) trichloride hydrate, and t-butylperbenzoate. Importantly, inclusion of an oxidizing agent from the group specified above stabilizes the reagent, thereby preventing a high blank reaction (which introduces error into the assay of an analyte). The reagent may be provided in solution form by adding water, or may be included in a film by adding a film-forming agent. The reagent may be utilized to perform the assay of an analyte from a fluid sample. The assay may be conducted in a solution medium by adding the fluid sample to the liquid reagent, and spectrophotometrically measuring absorbance of the color indicating formazan (produced by reduction of the tetrazolium salt under assay conditions). Likewise, the assay may be conducted in a film medium by adding the fluid sample to the reagent incorporated in the film, and spectrophotometrically measuring reflectance or transmittance of the color indicating formazan.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the colorimetric assay of an analyte from a fluid
sample, wherein the reagent utilized for assay includes a tetrazolium salt.The colorimetric assay of an analyte from a fluid smaple by utilizing a
reagent that includes a tetrazolium salt is well known. Schematically, such
assay is exemplified as shown immediately below (exemplified for glucose
assay):
In the above example, glucose is catalytically oxidized by glucose
dehydrogenase (GDH) to gluconic acid. As glucose is oxidized, a mediator,
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD] is reduced (NADH). A second
enzyme, diaphorase, reoxidizes NADH to NAD and reduces the tetrazolium salt
to a colored formazan. Alternatively, the enzyme involved in catalytic oxidation
of glucose may be glucose oxidase (GOD), and the mediator may be
phenazine ethosulfate (PES) (see schematic above). (When GOD is the enzyme
involved in glucose oxidation, the second enzyme, diaphorase, is not required
for the assay. PES (reduced form) will reduce the tetrazolium salt to the
colored formazan. thereby reoxidizing PES.) The use of tetrazolium salts in a reagent for the assay of an analyte in a
fluid sample is disclosed in Baker, US Patent No. 4,645,742, issues February 24,
1987, Hidehiko et al., US Patent No. 4,427,771, issues January 24, 1984, and
Case et al., US Patent No. 4,247, 633, issues January 27, 1981.Ko√©ver et al, US Patent No. 4,743,559, issues May 10, 1988, discloses the
incorporation of iodate in a reagent test strip that includes a tetrazolium salt,
Iodate is added to oxidize ascorbic acid and remove it as an interferent in
assays that involve oxidation reduction reactions.Pawlak, US Patent No. 4,892,817, issues January 9, 1990, discloses
moderate stabilization of tetrazolium salt solutions by addition of potassium
permanganate, and manganese dioxide. Pawlak does not provide any reagent
formulations that include these oxidizing agents, but merely lists in Table 2 of
Pawlak that moderate stabilization is achieved in a few cases.None of these references discloses a reagent that includes a tetrazolium
salt and furtehr includes the oxidizing agents (disclosed below), which are
useful for stabilizing the reagent, thereby decreasing the blank reaction
observed in assays utilizing reagents that include a tetrazolium salt.Palmer et al., US Patent No. 5,036,000, describe a colorimetric assay system for
the measurement of the concentration of NAD(P)H, NAD(P) or an analyte in a
sample, which analyte reacts to form or consume NAD(P)H. This system
