<ABSTRACT>
As a charger-side connector is pushed into a car body-side 
connector, push-out slanting surfaces of a spring plate slide 

respectively along push-out slanting surfaces of a deep hole 
halfway, and therefore a restoring force tends to push the 

charger-side connector back. Namely, if the hold is released 
halfway, the two connectors are moved away from each other, so 

that the electrical connection is broken. On the other hand, 
when the connector is pushed until each leading portion of the 

spring plate passes past a peak defined by a portion of 
connection between a drawing slanting surface the push-out 

slanting surface of the deep hole, the charger-side connector 
is drawn. Namely, although the connector is pushed out 

halfway, it is drawn when it passes past this halfway point, so 
that the two connectors are automatically connected together 

electrically if the hold is released.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector, and more particularly
to a connector having a mechanism for maintaining
a fitted condition.As a connector of this type, a connector shown in Fig.
14 is known. In Fig. 14, one connector 1 has external
threads 2 formed on an outer peripheral surface of an end
portion thereof, and the other connector 3 has at its outer
periphery a rotation ring 5 having internal threads 4
threadedly engageable with the external threads 2.The two connectors 1 and 3 are disposed in opposed relation
to each other, and the rotation ring 5 is rotated to
threadedly engage the internal threads 4 with the external
threads 2, so that the connectors 1 and 3 are moved toward
each other, and are electrically connected together. By rotating
the rotation ring 5 in the opposite direction, the
connectors 1 and 3 are disengaged from each other, thereby
breaking the electrical connection.In the above conventional connector with the rotation
guide, electrical connection and disconnection is achieved
by rotating the rotation ring 5; however, the electrically-connected
condition can not be easily grasped merely by rotating
the rotation ring 5, and therefore there has been
encountered a problem that a half-connected condition in
which the connection is incomplete can occur.US-A-4,669,797 shows a locking arrangement for mating
electrical connector housings including a locking clip interfitting
within a release clip each being releasably inserted
into a passage of one housing with a forward end
portion of the locking clip extending into a passage of the
other housing for locking the mated housings together. Release
occurs as a result of manual actuation either by the
forward end portions being deflected laterally or by the
release clip being pushed axially in its passage towards 
the forward end portions thereby engaging a protuberance
which deflects the end portions laterally and from engagement.In case of this known locking arrangement the elastic
locking clip or its tips thereof, respectively, either must
be manually squeezed together or must be squeezed together
by the additional release clip. In other words, disconnection
of the two connector housings by simply pulling them
apart is not possible in case of US-A-4,669,797 and not
even desired, since a positive lock, which can not be released
by simply pulling apart the two connector housings
is desired here.Thus, if a connector device is desired which must be
coupled and decoupled, respectively, frequently, as it is
used for e.g. charging an electric

<CLAIMS>
A connector device comprising:

a first connector (10) including a first mating means
(17) having a drawing slanting surface (17a2) receding progressively

in an inserting direction; and
a second connector (20) to be coupled with said first
connector (10), including a second mating means having a

spring member (25) bent to provide a leading portion (25a)
which is projected toward said drawing slanting surface

(17a2), wherein
said leading portion (25a) passes past a peak of said
drawing slanting surface and slides down therealong, so

that the second mating means is drawn into said first mating
means (17) during insertion operation, and said leading

portion (25a) is brought into intimate contact with said
drawing slanting surface (17a2) at a proper fitted position,

wherein furthermore
said first mating means (17) includes a push-out
slanting surface (17a1), and said push-out slanting surface

(17a1) causes said spring member (25) to be pushed out
against the inserting direction before said leading portion

(25a) passes a peak of said drawing slanting surface during
the inserting operation, wherein a portion of said first

connector disposed rearward of the peak of said drawing
slanting surface in the inserting direction is receding

progressively in a direction opposite to the inserting direction
to form said push-out slanting surface (17a1) and a

portion of said first connector disposed in front of the
peak of said drawing slanting surface in the inserting direction

is receding progressively in a direction towards
the inserting direction to form said drawing slanting surface

(17a2).
The connector device according to claim 1, wherein
two of said spring members (25) are disposed in opposed relation 

to each other, with abutment surfaces of said leading
portions (25a) directed outwardly, and those portions

extending forwardly from said leading portions (25a) in the
inserting direction are bent inwardly to form slanted surfaces,

and are connected together at their front end portions
to form an interconnecting portion (25c); and


two of said drawing slanting surfaces (17a2) are disposed
in opposed relation to each other so as to allow the

insertion of said interconnecting portion (25c).
The connector device according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein said first and second connectors (10, 20) include

power terminals (13) for supplying electrical power.
The connector device according to anyone of claims
1 to 3, wherein said first and second connectors (10, 20)

include signal terminals (15) for transmitting control signals.
The connector device according to anyone of claims
