<ABSTRACT>
Silicone compositions which contain reinforcing 
silica filler whose surface is treated with 

hexamethyldisilazane and stearated precipitated calcium 
carbonate exhibit high tear strength compared to similar 

compositions which do not contain that combination of 
fillers. The silicone compositions can be silicone sealant 

compositions. The viscosity of the silicone sealant 
composition maintains a value which allows the sealant 

composition to be readily extruded. The silicone sealant 
composition which further contains a small amount of ground 

calcium carbonate exhibits enhanced adhesion of cured 
silicone sealant to other cured silicone sealant when mated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to curable filled silicone 
compositions which cure or vulcanize at room temperature. Silicone materials are well known in the art and 
are made from a variety of ingredients to provide a 
multitude of different properties. One class of silicone 
materials are those which cure at room temperature, 
especially the silicone sealants which cure via silicon-bonded 
hydrolyzable groups. These sealants are available in 
many kinds of delivery forms, such as one package products 
which are stable in the package but cure when extruded from 
the package and exposed to atmospheric moisture; two package 
products which cure at room temperature when the contents of 
the two packages are mixed; and packaged in dispersion form 
such as organic solvent dispersions and aqueous latexes. 
Although many kinds of silicone sealants are useful for 
various applications, improvements in many of their physical 
and chemical properties are sought. One such property is 
tear strength. Many applications in which silicone sealants 
are used, do not require a substantial tear strength. 
However, there are other applications in which tear strength 
is an important characteristic. Without high tear 
strengths, these materials would not be candidates for such 
applications. Silicone sealants are known to have rather 
low tear strengths compared to many other materials, but 
because they have many other valuable properties, they are 
highly desirable if the tear strengths could be increased. One approach to achieving high tear strengths is 
to use high concentrations of reinforcing fillers, such as 
silica fillers like fumed silica, both untreated and 
treated. However, as the concentration of the silica filler 
is increased in the sealant composition, the viscosity 
increases substantially and one experiences stiff and  
 
difficult to extrude compositions even if rather low 
viscosity polydiorganosiloxanes are used as base polymers. 
For this reason, many kinds of approaches have been used to 
achieve high tear strength but in each case it seems that 
other properties which make the silicone sealant so 
desirable are compromised. Therefore, it is an object of this invention to 
achieve a silicone composition which cures to a high tear 
strength product while also maintaining other valuable 
characteristics. This invention provides a silicone composition 
comprising a curable polydiorganosiloxane composition, a 
reinforcing silica filler treated with hexamethyldisilazane 
and stearated precipitated calcium
