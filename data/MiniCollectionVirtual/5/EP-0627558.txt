<ABSTRACT>
An electric-motor/hydraulic-pump assembly (10) in which an 
electric motor (11) has a motor housing (12) and a motor drive shaft 

(24), and a 
hydraulic pump (28) is mounted directly to one end of the motor housing 

and internally coupled to the shaft to form a unitary assembly in 
which vibration generated by operation of the pump is transmitted 

to the motor housing. Support feet (50) are affixed to the motor housing 
(12) for mounting the motor/pump assembly to underlying support 

structure, 
and sound dea
dening ferrules (60) are interposed between the motor 
housing 

and the support feet to inhibit transmission of structureborne noise 
from the motor housing to the support structure. The motor and pump 

are surrounded by a sound enclosure (48) to inhibit radiation of airborne 
noise into the surround atmosphere. Fluid is drawn through an inlet (30) 

in the sound enclosure and through the motor housing to cool the 
motor, and then pumped to a fluid outlet (44,46) in the enclosure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to electric motors and 
hydraulic pumps provided in the form of a unitary motor/pump assembly, 
and more particularly to suppression of audible noise radiated by 
the motor housing. In unitary electric-motor/hydraulic-pump assemblies, the 
pump portion of the assembly is mounted on one end of the housing of 
the electric motor and coupled to the motor shaft within the assembly. 
During operation of the pump, reaction forces generated by the pumping 
members are transmitted to the pump support structure and through 
the bearings to the pump shaft. This vibration energy is therefore 
transmitted both directly to the motor housing, and through the shaft 
to the motor components and thence to the motor housing, which 
provides a large surface for radiating energy into the surrounding 
atmosphere as audible noise. Furthermore, noise is generated by 
vibration through the motor housing mounting feet to the support 
structure on which the motor/pump assembly is mounted. Noise radiation in industrial environments is of increasing 
concern from the standpoint of health and safety of equipment 
operators. It has heretofore been proposed to place isolation pads 
between the motor mounting feet and the underlying support structure 
to inhibit transmission of vibration noise to the support structure. 
See "Noise Control in Hydraulic Systems" published by applicant's  
 
assignee in 1991, Publication No. 510-H91GG. When a load is applied 
to the motor, the reaction torque is supported by one set of isolation 
pads, and the opposite set is unloaded. If the isolation pads on 
the unloaded side do not include material between the motor foot and 
the tie-down bolts, the vibration noise will be transmitted directly 
to the support structure. Moreover, such isolation pads have no 
substantial effect on radiation of noise from the motor housing. EP-A-0,088,674 discloses an electric motor/hydraulic pump assembly 
comprising an electric motor having a motor housing and a motor shaft 
accessible at one end of said housing, a hydraulic pump coupled to said 
shaft and mounted to said one end of said motor housing to form a unitary 
assembly in which vibration generated by operation of said pump is 
transmitted to said motor housing, and support feet affixed to and 
extending from said motor housing for mounting said motor housing to a 
housing support structure. However, there is a need for more effective 
means of controlling both structure borne and air borne noise in such 
apparatuses. It is
