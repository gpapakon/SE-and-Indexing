<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a process for processing fish fillets, relating to the removal of a surface layer, and of an apparatus for carrying out the process. The essential parts of the apparatus are a conveying roll (3), which supports the fish fillets on the skin side, and a pressing-on shoe (6) which, with its pressing-on surface (7), forms a conveying gap with the conveying roll (3). On the inlet side of the conveying gap, the pressing-on shoe (6) is configured as the first cutter (11), above which there is arranged, in a cutter guide (14), a second cutter (16), which is driven. This arrangement makes it possible to remove a further surface layer in addition to the skin and to collect these two layers separately from one another.

<CLAIMS>
Method of processing fish fillets with respect to the separating off of a surface layer
including the skin, characterised in that the skin as such is separated off with or directly

before the separating off of the surface layer.
Device for carrying out the method according to claim 1, comprising a conveying
roller (3) with gripping circumferential surface (4), a presser shoe (6) with a presser

surface (7) disposed opposite the circumferential surface (4) whilst leaving a small gap,
and a cutting device comprising a first knife (11), which is disposed adjacent the

circumferential surface (4) of the conveying roller (3) by its cutting edge (12), and a second
knife (16), which is disposed further from the circumferential surface (4) by its cutting edge

(21), characterised in that the first knife (14) is constructed as a fixed knife and the second
knife (16) as an oscillatingly driven knife, and the cutting edge (21) of the outer knife (16) is

mounted, with respect to the cutting edge (12) of the inner knife (11) and to the conveying
direction of the fish fillet, equally with or behind the cutting edge (12) of the inner knife (11).
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the cutting edge (12) of the first
knife (11) is constructed as a component of the presser shoe (6), wherein the presser

surface (7) extends, considered in the rotational direction of the conveying roller (3),
directly behind the cutting edge (12).
Device according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the second knife (16) is
constructed as a blade guided in a knife guide (14).
Device according to one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in that the presser shoe (6)
together with the first knife (11) can be urged against the force of a spring (9) in the sense

of an enlargement of the spacing of its presser surface (7) and the second knife (16) is
settable with respect to the spacing of its cutting edge (21) from the circumferential surface

(4) of the conveying roller (3).
