<ABSTRACT>
Into a fabric having single or two or more ply yarns of any 
kind of fiber, whether natural or man-made, in the warp and 

weft, arranged according to any type of weave, are interlaced, 
according to a preestablished alternation ratio, 

single or ply yarns which are at least partially mixed with 
a carbon filament so that said carbon filament forms in 

the fabric an orthogonal grid similar to a network having 
square or rectangular meshes, thus obtaining an effective 

shield against electric fields induced by alternating current 
particularly in the frequency range of from 50 to 

1000 Hz.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a compound fabric made 
up of a single (one-ply) yarn (hereinafter also called 
"single") and ply yarns of conventional textile fibers of 
any kind and of any yarn count whatsoever, in the warp and 
weft (or filling) of which are inserted, according to pre-set 
alternation ratios and with an orthogonal reticular 
pattern, singles or ply yarns at least partially mixed with 
a carbon filament. Within the context of the instant 
disclosure the term "carbon filament" is used to identify 
a carbon filament made up of one or more strands. It is an object of the instant invention to provide a 
fabric which, while preserving the best possible appearance 
and modelling characteristics, possesses shielding properties 
against electric fields generated by the presence of 
alternating currents. According to the invention, the problem can be solved 
by inserting, in a predetermined manner, according to an  
 
orthogonal reticular pattern with specific, not necessarily 
equal ratios, in the warp and in the weft, one or more 
singles or ply yarns mixed, at least partially, with a 
carbon filament, said singles or ply yarns being inserted 
between the single yarn or ply yarns of the basic 
fiber(s) of the fabric.  
 A basic fabric of non-conductive fibers in which 
electroconductive yarns are inserted, is known in the 
art. WO 85/00556 discloses an electrostatic dissipating 
fabric constructed of woven or knitted basic fabric having 
an integrally woven or knitted grid structure which is 
raised above the surface of the base fabric thereby resulting 
in increased electrostatic dissipation performance. 
The grid is formed from a static discharge yarn plied to 
a carried yarn which is then woven or knitted into the 
fabric in the warp direction, the fill direction or both, 
thereby producing a fabric which exhibits the rapid yet 
controlled dissipation of static electricity. Such fabric 
can be used for anti-static garments, anti-static covering 
cloths, filtration media and the like. This patent does not provide any teaching for a 
fabric possessing shielding properties against electric 
fields in the frequency range from 50 to 1000 Hz.  
 A cloth made of carbon filaments only, arranged warpwise 
and weft-wise,thus having a 1:1 ratio of alternation, 
was subjected to shielding effectiveness tests 
against a 60 Hz electric field of the U.S. power supply 
network. The measurements made at a Laboratory of the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (formerly

A compound fabric for making ready-made articles, 
in particular articles of clothing, constituted 

by a basic fabric comprising warp and weft yarns, 
however inserted in the weave pattern, said yarns 

comprising a single yarn or two-or-more-ply yarns of 
any kind of fiber, whether natural or man-made, wherein 

in the warp and in the weft of the basic fabric 
are inserted, according to a preestablished alternation 

ratio, single yarns or ply yarns forming in said 
basic fabric an orthogonal grid similar to a network 
characterized in 
that
 the inserted yarns are made of a single carbon 
filament or by ply yarns which are at least partially 

mixed with a carbon filament, said carbon filaments 
having a yarn count in the range of from 20 to 70 

dTex and in that the inserted yarns are inserted according to an alternation 
ratio of from 1 out of 2 to 1 out of 100 in the warp 

and in the weft of the basic fabric, and in that the said network 
constitutes a shield against the electric field induced 

by alternating currents especially in the frequency 
range of from 50 to 1000 Hz . 
A compound fabric according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said single or ply yarns which are 

at least partially mixed with a carbon filament, are 
inserted according to an alternation ratio of from 1  

 
out of 3 to 1 out of 70, viz. a single or a ply yarn 

mixed with a carbon filament from one every two to 
one every sixtynine single or ply yarns of the basic 

fiber of which the fabric is made, while the carbon 
filament has a yarn count in the range of from 20 to 

40 dTex. 
A compound fabric according to claims 1 and 2 
characterized in that said single or ply yarns, which 

are at least partially mixed with a carbon filament, 
are inserted according to an alternation ratio which 

is the same in the warp as in the weft of the basic 
fabric. 
A compound fabric according to claims 1 and 2 
characterized in that said single or ply yarns, which 

are at least partially mixed with a carbon filament, 
are inserted according to an alternation ratio which 

is different in the warp from that of the weft of the 
basic fabric. 
A compound fabric according to one or more of 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the basic fabric 

comprises single or homogeneous ply yarns, whether 
natural or man-made, or it comprises two or more-ply 

yarn fibers of different kind, both in the warp and 
in the weft, into which single or ply yarns are inserted 

the single or ply yarns mixed with a carbon  
 

filament.
