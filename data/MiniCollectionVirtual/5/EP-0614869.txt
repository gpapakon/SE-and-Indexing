<ABSTRACT>
Process for the hydrogenolytic reduction of peroxidic ozonolysis products to the corresponding carbonyl compounds in the presence of an inert organic diluent and in the presence of a monolith catalyst at hydrogen pressures from 0.01 to 2.0 MPa and at temperatures from -10 to 150@C and an apparatus for the catalytic hydrogenolysis of chemical compounds which yield homogeneous, novel products by hydrogenolysis, using hydrogen.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the hydrogenolytic reduction of 
peroxidic ozonolysis products to give the corresponding 

carbonyl compounds in an organic diluent which is inert 
under the reaction conditions in the presence of a 

catalyst under a hydrogen pressure of 0.01 to 2.0 MPa and 
at temperatures of -10 to 150°C, characterized in that a 

monolithic catalyst is employed as the catalyst. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the monolithic catalyst comprises a catalyst support 

coated with a noble metal. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the catalyst support comprises a metal. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that an alcohol having 1 to 6 C atoms is 

employed as the inert organic diluent. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a hydrogen pressure of 0.1 to 

1.0 MPa is maintained. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that a temperature of 15 to 70°C is 

maintained. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that a device comprising a reservoir 

tank V for the chemical compound to be hydrogenolyzed, a 
pump P for feeding in the chemical compound, a device VE 

for introducing hydrogen and a manometer P for measuring 
the hydrogen pressure, a container F with a monolithic 

catalyst, a vessel G for collecting the reaction solution, 
which comprises a device T for temperature control 

and devices E1 and E2 for removal of the product solution, 
a circulating pump K for conveying the reaction 

solution and a device A for sampling, the reservoir tank 
V, the pump P, the hydrogen valve VE, the manometer for 

hydrogen P, the monolithic catalyst F, the vessel G, the 
circulating pump K and the device for sampling A being 

connected in series by lines for the reaction solution, 
it being ensured that the chemical compound to be hydrogenolyzed  

 
and the hydrogen are passed in co-current over 

the monolithic catalyst F and into the vessel G for 
collecting the reaction solution, so that it is furthermore 

ensured that the reaction solution can be passed 
from the collecting vessel with the aid of the circulating 

pump over the monolithic catalyst again, is 
employed.
