<ABSTRACT>
Described is a process for washing prints or dyeings on cellulosic fibre materials which is characterised in that the printed or dyed fibre materials are treated in an aqueous washing liquor with a washing agent containing     (a) a polyvinylpyrrolidone homo- or copolymer and   (b) a water softener. The process of the invention makes it possible to achieve complete removal of unfixed dye from the fibre material and thus to improve the fastness properties of the dyeings.
