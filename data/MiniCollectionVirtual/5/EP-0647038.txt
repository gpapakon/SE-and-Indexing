<ABSTRACT>
An analog radio voice communicator includes a speech encoding system 
(131,133) that acts in series with normal analog speech processing. Normal 

corrupted speech is encoded during operation of the radio voice communicator. The 
signal strength of the incoming speech signal is monitored (by 121). During fades 

when the signal strength is below a threshold value a fade is recognized and the 
resultant noise signal remaining is ignored by the speech encoding system. A 

decoder (135) is included in the communicator and operates in cooperation with the 
encoder and responds to the fade and for the interval of the fade substitutes 

reconstructed speech in place of the noise signal. Reconstruction is based on the 
most likely characteristics of the voice signal wave form to follow the previous 

actual voice signal. This arrangement uses the filter coefficients generated by linear 
predictive coding techniques (131) and the excitation vectors (133) developed by 

excitation analysis to reconstruct the expected speech signal in a synthesis filter 
(135).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mobile radio communication devices such as 
radiotelephones and in particular to compensating for fades in a radio voice 
communication channel. The propagation of radio communication signals transmitted to mobile 
analog communicators is subject to many propagation impairments. These 
impairments range from Rayleigh fades due to multipathing and scattering effects to 
shadow fading due to terrain effects incurred while the mobile communicator is in 
motion. Rayleigh fading is a short term phenomena that has a duration measured in 
a fraction of a second (i.e. multiple fades within a second). Despite the shortness of 
duration the Rayleigh fading has a significant impact on the received voice quality of 
the mobile radio communicator. A Rayleigh fade may result in a field strength 
reduction of up to 30 dB. This momentary interruption of the radio voice signal 
causes many gaps in the continuity of the signal which is readily apparent to the user 
in the output speech signal. These gaps are particularly disruptive in FM radio systems. FM radio 
communication systems are subject to the phenomenon of phase slippage, when 
noise (i.e at low S/N) dominates the vector addition of the RF voltages 
corresponding to signals and noise. During these instants the composite IF waveform 
instantaneously encircling the complex plane origin causing an apparent phase 
change of 2π radians. The FM/phase detector responds to this phenomenon by 
producing individual Rice clicks. As the S/N ratio drops, these clicks merge into a 
crackling or sputtering noise whose amplitude is large relative to the normal speech 
output. These impairments are very disruptive to the speech quality. The problem of voice degradation is ubiquitous in cellular 
radiotelephone systems using analog radiotelephones in present analog 
radiotelephone systems (i.e. AMPS). It is particularly aggravated by the fact that 
these radiotelephones are frequently used while in motion causing the fade rate to 
increase which further impairs the quality of communication. This may if aggravated 
enough affect the intelligibility of the speech to the recipient. The cellular radiotelephone system handoff procedures also may cause a 
speech interruption problem similar in time duration to that experienced by active 
handset receivers in response to a fading condition. As the mobile radiotelephone  
 
moves away from an old cell toward a new cell the handoff process transfers the call 
to the new cell. This process of transfer includes
