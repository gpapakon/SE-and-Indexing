<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process or
removing particulate components deposited as impurities on
the molded products of fluorine-containing resin.Currently even fine particles of submicron size
must be removed from the molded products of fluorine-containing
resin in the field of the so-called high
technology. Further, a demand for higher degree of
cleaning is expected to increase.For example, containers made of fluorine-containing
resin are currently used for holding an agent
or wet etching in production of semiconductors, i.e.
representative products in the field of the high
technology. These containers are usually cleaned with a
dilute aqueous solution of a surfactant, strong acid,
ultrapure water, or when required, may be
cleaned by supersonic treatment or immersion. These
methods, however, can not achieve a satisfactory level of
cleaning on containers of fluorine-containing resin,
compared with the level on containers of polyethylene and
therefore may be unemployable for containers for holding
an agent for wet etching. JP-A-63-310683 discloses a method for cleaning articles
of fluorine-containing resins, comprising introducing steam into
a washing container, maintaining the container at a high
temperature, high pressure and high humidity for a specific
period of time, reducing the internal pressure of the container
and showering the article in the container with water to rapidly
cool the article.DD-A-152921 discloses a method for removing particles
adhering to a surface by spraying the surface with ultra-pure
water and at the same time exposing the surface to ultra-violet
rays.US-A-4680060 discloses a process for extracting contaminants
from the surface of plastics articles using alcohol.However, these documents merely disclose cleaning methods
using water or alcohol as a cleaning solution. None of these
documents disclose that fine particles deposited on articles of
fluorine-containing resins can be removed to a high degree of
cleaning by bringing the article into contact with a specific
polar solvent used in the present invention. Therefore, these
documents disclose in no way the technical features of the
present invention.More specifically, the containers of fluorine-containing
resin for holding a 50% aqueous solution of HF 
to be used in the manufacture of semiconductors must be
cleaned to such an extent that after cleaning, 10
particles or less are contained in one milliliter of the
solution in terms of the particles not smaller than 0.3 Âµm
in particle size, and that after cleaning, one

<CLAIMS>
A method for removing the fine particles deposited on
an article of fluorine-containing resin, the method comprising

bringing the article of fluorine-containing resin into contact
with a polar solvent or an aqueous solution of polar solvent,

the polar solvent being at least one solvent selected from the
group consisting of fluorine-containing carboxylic acids

represented by the formula R
f
COOH, wherein R
f
 is a fluorine-containing
hydrocarbon group having 3 to 20 carbon atoms and

ketones represented by the formula R
1
COR
2
, wherein R
1
 and R
2

are the same or different and each represent an alkyl group
having 1 to 5 carbon atoms. 
A method as defined in claim 1 in which the article
is cleaned at least once with

at least one of ultrapure
water, a cleaning agent and an aqueous solution of electrolyte

at a concentration of not lower than 0.5 % by weight,
before or after or both before and after

bringing the article into contact with a polar solvent or
an aqueous solution of polar solvent.
