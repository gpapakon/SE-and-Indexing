<ABSTRACT>
Described are a method and device for manufacturing paint brushes by machine, the method calling for an upwards-oriented funnel-shaped opening to be made by two or more separators (22) in a bundle of bristles (10) of sufficient size in such a way that a filler piece (11) can be inserted from above into the bundle of bristles (10) until the filler piece (11) is flush with the upper end (12) of the bundle of bristles (10).

Method of manufacturing a paint brush, in which a filler member is 
provided in the middle of the bristle bundle in the upper part thereof, 

wherein the free end of the bristle bundle has a predetermined structure, 
characterised thereby that initially a bristle bundle (10) of sufficient 

size is held freely suspended in about the upper third and receives one 
or more upwardly facing funnel-shaped openings by two or more cutter 

blades (22) in such a manner that a filler member (11) can be advanced 
from above within the bristle bundle (10) until the filler member (11) is 

oriented to be flush with the upper edge (12) of the bristle bundle (10). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the upper 
edge (12) of the unit consisting of bristle bundle (10) and filler member 

(11) is subsequently concavely shaped. 
Method according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised thereby that 
the filler member (11) - optionally consisting of several individual 

parts - is fed continuously from one or more rolls and is cut to the 
desired length by a counter-running double knife (25, 26) after the 

positioned introduction into the bristle bundle (10). 
Method according to claim 3, characterised thereby that an 
oscillating movement is superimposed on the cutting movement of the 

double knife (25, 26). 
Method according to one of claims 3 or 4, characterised thereby that 
a counterholder (27) is provided on the side of the filler member (12) 

remote from the knife blades. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby that 
the upper edge (12) of the unit formed by bristle bundle (10) and filler 

member (11) is provided with a ring and the resulting cavity within the 
said ring is filled up with a binding mass (15) of oil-like to pasty 

consistency in such a manner that the binding mass (15) penetrates at 
least partly into the upper part (16) of the bristle bundle (10).  

 
Method according to claim 6, characterised thereby that a metal ring 
is used. 
Method according to claim 6 or 7, characterised thereby that in 

addition an auxiliary ring is pushed over the bristle bundle (10). 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised thereby that 
finally brush handle (18) with cap (17) are fitted. 
Method according to claim 9, characterised thereby that the finished 
paintbrushes are securely positioned and held in a guide device during 

the hardening process of the binding mass (15) and until the hardening 
time has elapsed. 
Device for carrying out the method according to claim 1, 
characterised thereby that an equipment for pendent holding of a bristle 

bundle (10) is present as well as a further equipment for the funnel-shaped 
opening of the bristle bundle (10) with the aid of two or more 

cutter blades (22), which are oriented towards the centre point (23) of 
the bristle bundle (10) and movable in the direction of the centre point 

(23), as well as further by an equipment for the introduction of a filler 
member (11) and flush alignment thereof with the upper edge (12) of the 

bristle bundle (10). 
Device according to claim 11, characterised by an equipment for 
profile shaping for the upper edge (12) of the unit consisting of bristle 

bundle (10) and filler member (11). 
Device according to one of claims 11 or 12, characterised thereby 
that an equipment for quasi-continuous feed of material for the filler 

member (11) and one or more counter-running double knives (25, 26) for 
the cutting up of the fed filler member material into the respectively 

desired lengths are present.  
 
Device according to claim 13, characterised thereby that the double 
knife (25, 26) is designed for, in addition to the cutting movement, a 

superimposed oscillating movement in cutting direction. 
Device according to one of claims 13 or 14, characterised thereby 
that a counterholder (27) is arranged on the side of the filler member or 

members (12) remote from the knife blades. 
Device according to one of claims 11 to 15, characterised by a 
further equipment for the fitting of brush handle (18) and cap (17) on 

the brush head. 
Device according to one of claims 11 to 16, characterised by an 
additional equipment for positionally secure interim mounting of the 

products during the hardening time of the binding mass (15). 
Device according to one of claims 11 to 17, characterised by an 
additional equipment for the timely feed of an oil-like or pasty binding 

mass (15) to the upper edge (12) of the unit formed by bristle bundle 
(10) and filler member (11).
