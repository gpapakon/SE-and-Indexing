<ABSTRACT>
Processor circuit having a sequence controller (PC), at least one circuit block, connected thereto via a bus (BUS), and a test device, in the case of which there is assigned to the circuit blocks (SBi) a respective test decoder (TDi), which receives control signals (t, b) from a test logic unit (TL), likewise connected to the bus (BUS), and from the sequence controller (PC) and subsequently controls the circuit blocks (SBi), and in the case of which, in test mode, the test logic unit (TL) selects a specific circuit block (SBi) by means of the control signals (t, b), deactivates all the other circuit blocks, transmits test data to the selected circuit block (SBi) via the bus (BUS), activates the sequence controller (PC), receives test data, transmitted from the selected circuit block (SBi), via the bus (BUS), evaluates the said test data and outputs a corresponding result signal, the processing of the test data in the selected circuit block being determined by the sequence controller (PC).

Processor circuit having a processor flow
controller (PC), at least one circuit block (SBi) which

is connected to the processor flow controller (PC) via
a data bus (BUS) for the purpose of transmitting data

between a plurality of circuit blocks (SBi), and a test
device (T1, TDi),
characterized by
 a test device in which the circuit
blocks (SBi) have a respective associated test decoder

(TDi) which receives control signals (t, b, cs, rw)
from a test logic unit (TL), which is likewise

connected to the data bus (BUS), and from the processor
flow controller (PC) and then controls the circuit

blocks (SBi), and in which, in the test mode, the test
logic unit (TL) uses the control signals (t, b) to

select a particular circuit block (SBi), deactivates
all the other circuit blocks, sends test data to the

selected circuit block (SBi) via the data bus (BUS),
activates the processor flow controller (PC), receives

test data sent by the selected circuit block (SBi) via
the data bus (BUS), evaluates them and outputs a

corresponding result signal, the processing of the test
data in the selected circuit block (SBi) being

determined by the processor flow controller (PC).
Processor circuit according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 the test logic unit (TL) has a
test control unit (TC) which performs initialization,

test flow control and evaluation, a test mode register
(TMR) storing an address which corresponds to the

selected circuit block (SBi), at least one test data
transmission register (RT) storing the test data

intended for the selected circuit block (SBi), and at
least one test data reception register (RR) into which

the data modified by the selected circuit block (SBi)
are input for evaluation by the test control unit (TC). 
Processor circuit according to Claim 2,
characterized in that
 the test data reception register
(RR) comprises a shift register having a plurality of

inputs which is fed back via EXOR gates and compresses
the modified data using modulo-2 additions with a given

polynomial.
