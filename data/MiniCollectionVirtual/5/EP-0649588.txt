<ABSTRACT>
In order to require only a relatively small increase in data rate when the number of channels of multi-channel digitalised and bit rate reduced audio signals is increased, the psychoacoustic concealment by at least part of the remaining audio channels or the redundancy of individual audio channels is taken advantage of in each individual audio channel when reducing the bit rate of audio signals having more than two audio channels. Only those parts of the concerned audio channel are transmitted or stored which are not concealed by the audio signals of other audio channels or which are contained in the audio channels for stereophonic reproduction with all types of reproduction available for selection. In addition, the used parts are transmitted or stored with a resolution only big enough for the totality of all audio channels to keep concealed the quantization noise generated during quantization in all types of reproduction available for selection.

A process for the transmission or storage of digitalized sound signals with reduced bit 

rates, characterised by the fact that, for the bit reduction of sound signals with more 
than two sound channels (L, R. Z1, Z2, Z3), for each individual sound signal, 

psycho-acoustic masking by at least one part of the other sound channels or the 
redundancy of individual sound channels is fully exploited, such that 


Only those elements of the sound channel in question are transmitted or stored which, 
with the types of reproduction available for selection, are not masked by the sound 

signals of other sound channels, or are contained in the sound channels for 
stereophonic reproduction, and 
The elements used are transmitted or stored with such low resolution that the 
quantisation noise created by the quantisation process from the totality of all the sound 

channels remains masked with the types of reproduction available for selection. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the left and right 
channels (L, R) which are present in the multi-channel sound signals are matricised 

with the other sound channels (Z1, Z2, Z3) in such a way that a stereo-compatible left 
and right channel (Lo, Ro) is derived, and that the masking effects for a multichannel 

and for a stereophonic reproduction are calculated, the lower masking effect of which 
is used for the encoding of the stereo-compatible left and right channels (Lo, Ro), as 

well as of the other sound channels. 
A process according to Claim 2, characterised by the fact that at least one of the other 
sound channels (Z1, Z2, Z3) are matricised in such a way that the information 

elements contained in them, which are likewise contained in the stereo-compatible left 
and right channels (Lo, Ro) are removed entirely or in part, prior to the encoding or 

after partially effected encoding, by means of matricisation, and that information 
about the encoder-side matricisation is added to the encoded sound signals, which are 

used in the decoder-side reconstruction of the multi-channel sound signal for 
corresponding dematricisation. 
A process according to Claim 2, characterised by the fact that, for transmission and 
storage, a multiplex signals is formed from the stereo-compatible left and right 

channel (Lo, Ro), which corresponds to a known and standardised multiplex signal 
for two-channel encoded sound signals, and that the encoded data of the additional 

sound channels (Z1, Z2, Z3) are transmitted or stored in a separate multiplex signal.
