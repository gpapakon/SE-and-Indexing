<ABSTRACT>
A three dimensional imaging apparatus may be used as a microscope or 
camera. The apparatus comprises an array of lenses (4), each of which is 

aligned with a respective photodetector (E). A liquid crystal spatial light 
modulator (3) has several pixels (a, b, c) between each photodetector (E) 

and lens (4). A control circuit (CC) controls the modulator (3) so that the 
pixels (a, b, c) in front of each photodetector act as a moving shutter. 

The outputs of the photodetectors (E) are processed and stored (PCM) to 
form a three dimensional image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a three dimensional imaging apparatus and to a
microscope and camera using such apparatus.EP 0 335 282 discloses an arrangement which functions as a three dimensional camera.
An image pickup screen is disposed in the focal plane of a convex lens. A movable pin
hole is provided on a surface of the convex lens and cyclically scans across the surface.
In order to provide a sufficiently convincing three dimensional effect, the camera must
provide parallax information over a sufficiently large angular range. This in turn
requires that the convex lens have a large aperture. Such large convex lenses are, in
general, far too expensive and heavy and of insufficient optical performance for a
camera of this type to be practically or commercially viable. EP 0 335 282 suggests that
the convex lens may be replaced by a converging Fresnel lens. However, as is well
known, Fresnel lenses are unsuitable for imaging applications. Thus, EP 0 335 282 fails
to disclose an arrangement which can be commercially implemented.EP 0 029 568 discloses an arrangement for improving the resolution of an imaging
device. A lens is arranged to form an image of an object on an array of photodetectors.
A liquid crystal shutter is disposed between the lens and the photodetector.
A lens array is disposed between the shutter and the
photodetectors. The shutter is controlled so as to transmit a moving segment of the area
of the optical path through the arrangement.However, EP 0 029 568 is not concerned with three dimensional imaging.According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus as defined in
the appended Claim 1.According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided microscope as defined
in the appended Claim 12. According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a camera as defined in the
appended Claim 13.According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a camera as defined in
the appended Claim 14.Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined in the other appended claims.It is thus possible to provide a compact apparatus which allows three dimensional
images to be recorded by recording a sequence of two dimensional views from different
directions, i.e. using angular demultiplexing. Such angular demultiplexing can be
achieved without requiring large, expensive, or impractical lenses and permits the
practical and commercial implementation of cameras and microscopes.The invention will be further described, by way of example only, with
