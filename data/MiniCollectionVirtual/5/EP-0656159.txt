<ABSTRACT>
A circuit of a tuning device for tuning a radio transceiver, the circuit comprising a variable impedance device (14), which consists of a pair of variable resistors having an open circuit between their tracks, the "wiper arm" (14a) of which is connected to a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) (15). The voltage controlled oscillator may suitably comprise a CMOS 4046 integrated circuit. The voltage controlled oscillator outputs a stream of pulses, having in this case a 1:1 mark: space ratio, to the transceiver units micro-computer (not shown). At the centre point of the tracks of the variable impedance device (14) there is a null position corresponding to an open circuit. As the user turns a dial this centre position is indicated by a notch. As the wiper arm is moved from the centre position towards either extent, the value of the voltage at the VCO terminal (15a) increases. Because of this the rate of production of pulses, i.e. the frequency of the pulse stream output by the VCO (15), increases accordingly. Each pulse represents an increment or decrement of the frequency to which the radio transceiver (not shown) is tuned.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TUNING APPARATUS AND A METHODThis invention relates to tuning apparatus and a method of tuning and is concerned particularly, although not exclusively, with tuning apparatus and a method of tuning for use with a receiver of electromagnetic radiation.Modern radio receivers, and combined receivers and transmitters (known as transceivers) are digitally tuned to the desired radio frequency by an in-built micro computer which, when the desired radio frequency is reached, locks the digital tuner to that particular frequency.A known radio transceiver permits a user to manually scan through the receivable range of frequencies by turning a dial, until the desired frequency is reached, whereupon the tuner will be "locked" to that frequency by the micro computer. The dial works by generating a series of electronic pulses which are detected by the micro computer. Each pulse is ascribed a particular value corresponding to a change in frequency. For example each pulse may represent 10 Hz, and as the dial is manually turned to produce a stream of pulses, each pulse fed to the micro computer will cause the micro computer to increment or decrement the tuned frequency by 10 Hz. The rate of generation of the pulses is directly proportional to the rate of turning of the dial. The user continues to turn the dial until the transceiver is tuned up or down to the desired frequency and knows when the desired frequency has been reached by observing a digital display on the apparatus which indicates the frequency to which the transceiver is tuned. 

 The value in hertz of each of the pulses generated by the tuning of the dial can be varied. For example if the user wishes to change the tuned frequency by a large amount, eg. by several hundred kilohertz, the pulses can be ascribed a value of a 100 Hz. This reduces the time taken to tune the transceiver to the desired frequency. In addition, the number of turns of the dial necessary to produce the required number of pulses is reduced. When for example the user has tuned the transceiver to within a few kilohertz he might ascribe to the pulses a lower frequency value to enable more accurate tuning to the desired frequency. This alteration of the size of the steps taken by the digital tuner is typically made by pressing an appropriate button on the front of the transceiver. The value of each pulse might be variable by factors of 10 between, say 5 Hz and 5 KHz. Despite being able to vary the steps taken by the digital tuner as it progresses through the range of tunable frequencies it
