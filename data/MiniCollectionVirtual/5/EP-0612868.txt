<ABSTRACT>
A single crystal diamond is produced by forming a less 
concentrated diamond region on a surface of a single crystal 

diamond substrate, epitaxially growing a single crystal diamond 
on the substrate by a vapor-phase growth method, and separating 

the epitaxially grown diamond from the diamond substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing diamond, more particularly, to a process for
producing large diamond single crystals that are useful as
semiconductor materials, electronic parts, optical parts,
cutting tools, abrasive tools, precision tools, etc.Diamond has many advantageous properties such as high
hardness, high heat conductivity, high light transmittance and
a wide band gap and, hence, it is used extensively as a
material of various kinds of tools, optical parts,
semiconductors and electronic parts and its importance is
expected to grow in the years to come. In the past, naturally
produced diamonds were used in engineering applications but
today most of the industrial diamonds used are synthetic. In
commercial plants, all diamond single crystals are currently
synthetized at pressures in the range higher than several tens
of thousands of atmosphere where they are stable. Since
pressure vessels which are capable of creating such ultrahigh
pressures are not only very expensive but also limited in size,
the applicability of the high-temperature, high-pressure method
to the production of large synthetic diamond single crystals is
limited. As for the type Ib diamond which is yellow in the
presence of impurity nitrogen (N), crystals with sizes of the 
order of 1 cm have been synthesized by the high-pressure method
and are already sold on the market; however, this would be the
limit in the production of large synthetic Ib diamonds. The
size of pure, clear and colorless type IIa diamond crystals
that can be synthesized today is limited to even smaller values
(less than a few millimeters) with the exception of natural
products.In addition to the high-pressure process, there is
another method that has been established as a technique for
diamond synthesis and it is the vapor-phase process. Crystals
of comparatively large areas (from a few to ten centimeters)
have been synthetized by this process and they are usually in
the form of a polycrystalline film. However, if diamond is to
be used in ultrahigh precision tools, optical parts and
semiconductors that require very smooth surfaces, single-crystal
rather than polycrystalline quality is necessary.
Under the circumstances, studies have heretofore been made to
develop a method that enables single crystal diamond to grow
epitaxially in the vapor-phase process. There are two
approaches for effecting epitaxial growth; homoepitaxy which
causes a substance to grow on a substrate made of a similar
substance, and heteroepitaxy in which a substance

epitaxial growth method on a single crystal

diamond substrate, comprising linear voids occupying at
least 5%, in terms of cross-sectional area, and having a

the steps of:

forming linear recesses in a surface of said single
crystal diamond substrate, said recesses having a width

of at least 2 µm and occupying at least 5% of an area of
said surface; and
epitaxially growing said single crystal diamond on said
