<ABSTRACT>
A multi-ply flushable toilet seat cover e.g. for preventing 
residual water and urine droplets on a toilet seat from penetrating 

through the cover to the skin of the user. In one form the cover (10) includes 
first and second tissue webs (14,16) having a basis weight in the range of 

from about 4 pounds to about 50 pounds per ream, and a water 
soluble plastic film (18) sandwiched therebetween. The water soluble 

plastic film (18) may be attached to the tissue webs (14,16) by means of 
embossing, hot embossing, adhesives, heat sealing, or the like. 

The layer of tissue placed against he toilet seat absorbs the water 
or urine droplets thereon. Through the wicking properties of the 

tissue, the liquid is spread over a wider area thereof, thereby 
preventing liquid in sufficient quantity to dissolve through a 

relatively smaller area of the water soluble plastic film to come 
into direct contact with such a relatively smaller area of the 

water soluble plastic film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to disposable, multi-ply, 
sanitary products, and more particularly, to flushable, laminated 
toilet seat covers. Numerous disposable toilet seat covers are known in the prior 
art. Many of such prior art toilet seat covers are laminated and 
are intended to be flushable after use. One such toilet seat cover 
is taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,352,214 to Belz. Toilet seat cover 
taught in such patent comprises a layer of textile waste fibers 
partially imbedded in a layer of water soluble foil such as 
polyvinyl alcohol. Alternatively, the fibers may be attached to 
a layer of polyvinyl alcohol by means of an adhesive. Preferably, 
a sealing layer is attached to the side of the foil opposite the 
layer of fibers. The sealing layer is waterproof or water 
repellent. Because both the adhesive and the foil are water 
soluble, the fibers become detached therefrom when the cover is 
placed in an agueous environment. The sealing layer, which is only 
a few microns in thickness, is said to have little stability once 
it becomes detached from the foil and thus, the cover is intended 
to be flushable. U.S. Patent No. 3,263,241 to Saulson teaches a flexible 
laminated, flushable sheet, intended to be used as a disposable 
liner for bed pans. The first layer consists of a cellulosic fiber 
web. A thermoplastic material is applied to the web such as by 
extrusion. The thickness of the thermoplastic coating is in the 
range of 0.0001 to 0.001 inch. Apparently, the thermoplastic 
coating will disintegrate in the turbulence created by flushing a 
toilet. Although the prior art teaches a number of disposable toilet 
seat covers which serve as barriers to moisture which may be 
present on a toilet seat, and further which are flushable, typical 
of such prior art seat covers is that the moisture barrier layer  
 
is water insoluble. Thus, such toilet seat covers create a 
potential flushing hazard, particularly, in low water volume 
systems which create little turbulent flushing action. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide 
a laminated or multi-ply, flushable toilet seat which acts as a 
barrier to moisture, wherein the barrier layer is water soluble. Briefly stated, the foregoing and other features, objects and 
advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent 
upon reading the detail and description, claims and drawings set 
forth hereinafter. These features, objects and advantages are 
accomplished e.g. by sandwiching between two layers of sanitary
