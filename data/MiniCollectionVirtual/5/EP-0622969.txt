<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a video conversation/monitoring system according to the preamble of
claim 1, in particular to a multi-media communication system using the Integrated Service
Digital Network (ISDN), and particularly to a video conversation/monitoring system
applicable to a complex conversation service system that includes a remote monitoring
function.A conventional guidance system, conversation
system and monitoring system based on the communication
of images, sounds and data, and a complex system that
integrates these system have been using an analog
telephone line or a dedicated communication line based
on optical fiber or the like. An example of these
systems is described in Japanese patent publication JP-A-4-21095
and JP-A-4-315351.The above-mentioned prior art, when an
existing analog telephone line is used, has such
problems that the transmission line has a limited band
width and it is difficult to transmit efficiently moving
image signals and complex signals that carry sounds,
images and control data, and that the center station and
end station facilities that constitute the system are of
large scale and necessitate a large installation space. The above-mentioned prior art, when a
dedicated line or optical fiber line is used, has such
problems that a new transmission line needs to be
constructed, the service range and scale are limited by
the network construction, and construction of the system
is very expensive.The above-mentioned prior art, when the public
integrated-service digital communication network is used
for the communication line, in which case the construction
of a new communication line is not needed and a low
communication cost can be expected, has such a problem
that the system is accessible by unlicensed terminal
stations through the public communication line and the
handling of information will be intricate for secrecy
protection.EP-A-0 356 105 A2 discloses an image processing system for a teleconference system in which
a fixed and a rotatable camera are installed. The image coding means places emphasis of motion image coding when the latter is selected.This invention is intended to overcome the
foregoing prior art deficiencies, and first object
thereof is to provide a compact, simple and economical
video conversation/monitoring system capable of
performing the conversation and monitoring through the
bidirectional transmission of sounds, images and data
among stations.A second object of this invention is to
provide a simple and reliable video conversation/
monitoring
