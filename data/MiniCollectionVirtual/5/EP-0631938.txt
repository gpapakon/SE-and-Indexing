<ABSTRACT>
A folding case of polymeric material comprises two equal elements 
which can be coupled in a rapid way. Each element comprises a side 

wall of the case articulated, by means of film hinges, to a base panel 
and to two side panels suitable for defining, respectively, a half 

portion of the bottom wall and half portions of side folding walls of 
the case.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a folding case of
polymeric material having a bottom wall and four side walls,
particularly suitable for being used for transporting fruit
and vegetables.The need for providing folding cases is well known in the
sector of packaging and derives from the matter of fact that
the transport should be avoided of empty cases in mutual
stacked arrangement. An alternative to the folding cases
consists in providing disposable cases of low-cost polymeric
materials, to be used once only; such a solution is not
acceptable nowadays above all from the viewpoint of
environmental safeguard, in particular if one considers that
only a portion of the material which constitutes such
disposable cases is recycled.As regards the folding cases, already some solutions
exist and are disclosed in patent applications EP-A-301 140,
WO-A-90/12 738, AU-A-60 137/90 and in Italian Patent
IT 1 086 100. Although they accomplish the purpose of
providing a folding case, all of these solutions known from
the prior art display some disadvantages which limit the use
and the usefulness thereof. In particular, in such solutions
known from the prior art, the following disadvantages can be
observed:
-- difficulty of giving the cases such dimensions as
required by the market (external overall 
dimensions/internal capacity, presence of protrusions
beyond the external contour, and so forth);-- difficulty of obtaining both expected configurations
(i.e., the open/closed configuration);-- difficulty of assembly during the manufacturing step;-- the cases are not predisposed for being lifted by means
of mechanical lifting devices;-- high investment costs for the molds, because the cases
are constituted by a plurality of parts.EP-A-0 075 655 and US-A-4 235 345 disclose folding cases wherein the side walls consist
of six separate parts linked to each other by means of six complex articulations.The high complexity of structure and assembling operations required for the said folding
cases is therefore evident.On the other hand, EP-A-0 516 954 discloses the use of film hinges with articulating function
in folding containers.However the folding containers disclosed in EP-A-0 516 954 can only be folded flat, as they
do not comprise collapsible side walls. The purpose of the present invention is of overcoming
said disadvantages, thanks to the fact that the case comprises
two mutually equal elements linked to each other at the centre
line of two mutually facing walls which can be folded by means
of articulation hinges, with each

<CLAIMS>
Folding case of polymeric material, in particular for
fruit and vegetables, of the type provided with a bottom wall,

four side walls and articulation hinges, characterized in that
the case comprises two mutually equal elements (12) linked to

each other at the centre line of two mutually facing walls (10c)
which can be folded by means of articulation hinges (C), with

each element (12) comprising a rigid side wall (10b, 13) which
is articulatedly linked, by means of respective film hinges

(18, 14), to a base panel (20) which defines a portion of said
bottom wall (10a) of the case and to two side panels (15, 16)

which define portions of the folding walls (10c). 
Case according to claim 1, characterized in that the
above said side panels (15, 16) display, on their lower side,

locator means (28), suitable for cooperating with
corresponding edge portions (20a) of the base panel (20).
Case according to claim 2, characterized in that said
locator means comprise folded wings (28) provided with holes

(30) suitable for cooperating with corresponding coupling pins
(32) integral with the end portion (20a) of the base panel

(20), so as to keep it in its operating position, in the open
configuration of the case.
Case according to claim 2, characterized in that the
base panels (20) display front edges (20b) provided with

respective locator means (25, 26, 35, 36) suitable for
allowing a shape coupling between the same edges, in the open

configuration of the case. 
Case according to claim 4, characterized in that said
locator means comprise, for each base panel (20), a wing (26)

protruding from the front edge (20b) and placed adjacent to
a recessed seat (25) suitable for getting coupled, in the open

configuration of the case, with the corresponding wing
(26) of the opposite base panel (20).
Case according to claim 5, characterized in that the
wing (26) and the recessed seat (25) of the front edge (20b)

of each base panel (20) respectively extend along half-length
of said edge.
Case according to claim 4, characterized in that the
above said locator means comprise, for each base panel (20),

a plurality of teeth (35, 36) protruding from the front edge
(20b) and suitable for getting coupled, in the open

configuration of the case, with corresponding recessed seats
(35a) interposed between the teeth of the opposite base panel

(20).
Case according to claim 1, characterized in that the
articulation hinges (C) of the folding walls (10c) are

assembled onto the side panels (15, 16) and display
complementary portions (24, 26) which can be elastically snap

coupled.
Case according to claim 1, characterized in that the
articulation hinges (C, 24, 26) of the folding walls (10c) are

obtained by injection molding and are fastened to the side
walls (15, 16) by glue bonding or heat welding. 
Case according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the side walls (10b, 13) are provided,

at their lower edge, with support feet (11), so shaped as to
enable the cases to be stably stacked over each other.
