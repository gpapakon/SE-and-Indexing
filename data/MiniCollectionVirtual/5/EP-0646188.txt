Tool for embossing galvanically deformable 
plastics material layers, 


having a base plate and 
a plurality of raised microstructured bodies, which 
are mounted on the base plate and have end faces 

disposed parallel to the base plate, 
 
characterised in that
 
the end faces have a roughness with a depth of roughness 

R
t
 in the range of between 0.1 µm and 10 µm with a mean 
roughness value of between 0.01 µm and 1 µm. 
Method of producing a microstructured, 
galvanically deformable plastics material layer, wherein 


a) a composite layer is produced, comprising an 
electrically conductive layer and an electrically 

insulating layer, 
b) the composite layer is heated, 
c) a tool, having a plurality of raised 
microstructured bodies which are mounted on a base plate 

and have end faces extending parallel to the base plate, 
is pressed into the electrically insulating layer of the 

heated composite layer, 
d) the height of the raised microstructured bodies 
corresponding to at least the thickness of the 

electrically insulating layer,
 
characterised in that 
e) such a tool is used, wherein 

the end faces of the raised microstructured 
bodies have a roughness with a depth of roughness R
t
 in 
the range of between 0.1 µm and 10 µm with a means 

roughness value R
a
 of between 0.01 µm and 1 µm, and the  
 

insulating layer is selected to have a thickness of 
between 0.1 µm and 20 µm, 
the roughness of the end faces being so 
dimensioned that the tips and burrs of the rough end 

faces pierce the electrically insulating layer.
