<ABSTRACT>
A transfer ribbon cassette (A) includes a feed core 
for winding a transfer ribbon (R) 

having a transfer film applied to one surface thereof, 
a takeup core (2) for taking up 

the transfer ribbon fed from the feed core (1), a case (C) 
for containing the feed core 

and takeup core (2), and a holder for supporting the 
feed core (1) and takeup core in a 

relative positional relationship for mounting in the case (C). 
Each core is rotatably 

supported at one end thereof and, when mounted in the case, 
has a free axial 

end thereof supported by the case. This cassette (A) may be 
used as a paint film 

transfer device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a transfer ribbon device. More particularly, the
invention relates to a transfer ribbon cassette having a transfer ribbon wound
around a feed core and a takeup core maintained in predetermined relative
positions by a holder for mounting in a case, the transfer ribbon having a
transfer paint film applied to one surface thereof, such as a paint film for use in
correcting characters, an adhesive film for bonding purposes or a colored paint
film for ornamental use.A conventional transfer ribbon cassette, as shown in Fig. 25, has a pair of
right and left plates 01 connected to each other through spacers 05, with a space
therebetween corresponding to a ribbon width. A transfer ribbon R is wound
around a feed core 02 and a takeup core 03 supported by a holder 04 in the form
of a box-like frame. The two cores 02 and 03 are supported at opposite dial
ends thereof by the pair of plates 01, and fixed to a relative positional relationship
to be placed in a transfer device case.Thus, the holder 04 not only requires numerous materials for manufacture,
but has a complicated construction. Its fabrication and assembly of the feed
core 02 and takeup core 03 are of low productivity, consuming a great deal of
time and trouble. Such a transfer ribbon cassette has the disadvantage of high
manufacturing cost.Further conventional transfer ribbon cassettes and devices are known
from EP-A-380 977, EP-A-380 978, EP-A-427 870 or WO-A-91 17 108. The present invention has been made having regard to the state of the art
noted above. A primary object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide
a transfer ribbon cassette which may be manufactured at lower cost than the
conventional transfer ribbon cassettes with an improved support structure for the
feed core and takeup core, as well as a case for enclosing this transfer ribbon
cassette.A further object of the present invention is to provide a paint film transfer
device having the above transfer ribbon cassette and easy to use.The above primary object is fulfilled, according to the present invention, by
a transfer ribbon cassette as noted at the outset hereof, wherein each of the feed
core and takeup core is rotatably supported at one end thereof and, when mounted
in the case, has a free axial end thereof supported by the case as described in claim 1.In the above construction, each core is supported at one end thereof by the
holder and at the other end by the case when mounted in the case. Thus, the
holder for supporting the feed core and takeup core
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Transfer ribbon device with a transfer ribbon cassette (A) formed separately
from a case (C) and adapted to be enclosed in said case (C), said transfer ribbon

cassette (A) comprising:

transfer ribbon (R)
a feed core (1) for winding the transfer ribbon (R) having a transfer film (D)
applied to one surface thereof, one end of the peripheral surface of said feed

core (1) having a first groove (5),
a takeup core (2) for taking up said transfer ribbon (R) fed from said feed core
(1), one end of a peripheral surface of said takeup core (2) having a second

groove (5),
a holder (3) detachably held in said case (4), said holder (3) having first and
second engaging holes engaging with said feed core (1) and said takeup core

(2), respectively, said holder (3) further including a first tongue (7) extending in
said first engaging hole for elastically engaging said first groove (5) of said feed

core (1), and a second tongue (8) extending in said second engaging hole for
elastically engaging said second groove (5) of said takeup core (2) whereby

said feed core (1) and said takeup core (2) are rotatably supported by said
holder (3) at one end thereof;

and wherein each of said feed core (1) and said takeup core (2), when mounted
in said case (C), has a free axial end thereof supported by said case (C).
A transfer ribbon device as defined in claim 1,

wherein each of said feed core (1) and said takeup core (2) has first restrictor
means (6) defined at said free axial end thereof for checking displacement of

said transfer ribbon (R) toward said free axial end.
A transfer ribbon device as defined in claim 1,

further comprising a transfer head (4) for pressing said transfer ribbon (R) upon
a receiving surface to transfer said transfer film (D) to said receiving surface, 
and second restrictor means (12) for checking transverse displacement of said
transfer ribbon (R) moving
 past said transfer head (4).
A transfer ribbon device as defined in claim 1,

wherein said holder (3) rotatably supports one end of each of said feed core (1)
and said takeup core (2), such that a portion of said transfer ribbon (R)

extending from said feed core (1) to said takeup core (2) is visible through said
holder (3).
A transfer ribbon device as defined in claim 1,

wherein said holder (3') is Z-shaped as seen radially thereof for rotatably supporting
one end of each said feed core (1) and said takeup core (2) arranged

radially, said feed core (1) and said takeup core (2) being supported on a front
surface and a back surface of said holder (3'), respectively.
A transfer ribbon device as set forth in claim 3,

wherein said second restrictor means (12) is formed of resin integrally with said
holder (3) and supports opposite ends of said transfer head (4) transversely of

said transfer ribbon (R).
