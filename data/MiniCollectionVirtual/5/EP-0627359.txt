<ABSTRACT>
An non-fillable stopper (1) comprising a first 
tubular body or vessel (4), a second body or pourer (14), 

and a third body or skirt (22) arranged outside the neck 
(2) of the bottle (3); said vessel (4) comprising a guide 

(6) and openings (5), forming a first chamber (7) which 
comprises a plug (9) that can move along the guide (6) 

and a seated opening (8); said second body (14) forming a 
second chamber (18); and said third body (22) comprising 

fixing means, joining means and a cap (24) with tearable 
means (23). It is characterized in that it comprises an 

element (19), resistant to penetration by piercing 
objects, arranged inside the second chamber (18). 
The movable plug element (9) comprises a cylindrical 
part (10) which fits in the opening of the seat (8). 
It further comprises inclined flexible elements (21) 
arranged between the pourer (14) and the openings (5). 
It prevents bottles from being refilled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an non-fillable 
stopper. Said non-fillable stopper is for use in bottles 
in which the pouring of liquids does not imply the possibility 
of gaining access to the interior thereof, preventing 
fraudulent refilling. The use of non-fillable stoppers as a means of 
protecting and ensuring inviolability of the interior of 
bottles is a widely known field in which innovations 
appear constantly. Said innovations are a result of the 
continuing advances in the fraudulent activities relating 
to the refilling of bottles containing drinks, a practice 
which must be prevented at all costs. For this reason there is a great deal of documentation, 
references and records describing embodiments of 
non-fillable stoppers, among which it worth mentioning 
the following Spanish utility models: 
U 159124 for a "Bottle closing device". U 194560 for a "Irreversible axial coupling safety 
closure for liqueur bottles and other receptacles". U 250124 for a "Arrangement to prevent fraudulent 
opening of non-fillable stoppers". U 289887 for a "Bottle closing device" and patent PE 8701859 for Improvements in non-fillable 
stoppers". These documents describe different embodiments of 
non-fillable stoppers, all of them with similar characteristics 
such as the fact that they comprise a body 
fitted inside the mouth of the bottle, and that they are 
provided with a housing in the form of a cage inside 
which is arranged a plug valve that tends to remain in  
 
its seat, closing the liquid outlet opening, when the 
bottle is upright. Current non-fillable stoppers have demonstrated 
their effectiveness, but they no longer manage to prevent 
entirely improper tampering or the fraudulent refilling 
of bottles. These current stoppers offer little protection 
against access by piercing elements, such as hypodermic 
needles, nails, etc., which makes it possible to tamper 
with the plug valve and eliminate its tendency to remain 
in its seat, thereby allowing access to the interior of 
the bottle. Another known fraudulent practice is the insertion 
of metal pipes or tubes of small diameter at a high 
temperature such that they easily penetrate the various 
components, which are normally made of plastic, forming 
an opening which allows access to the interior of the 
bottle. It is also known that the valve and its seat are not 
one hundred percent watertight, and that said 
watertightness can be easily overcome, since the valve 
oscillates and rocks in its seat, allowing access to the 
interior of the

<CLAIMS>
An non-fillable stopper (1) comprising a first 
tubular body or vessel (4) which fits hermetically into 

the mouth of the neck (2) of a bottle (3) or the like, a 
second pouring body or element (14), joined to the first 

body (4), and a third body or skirt (22) arranged outside 
the neck (2) of the bottle (3) and which fixes the other 

two bodies (4,14), which are connected together, to the 
neck (2) of the bottle; said first tubular body or vessel 

(4) comprising a movement guide (6) and a plurality of 
openings (5) and said first body (4) forming a first 

chamber (7) which inside comprises a plug element (9) 
that can move along the movement guide (6) and a seated 

opening (8) for said plug element (9); said second body 
(14), joined to the first body (4), forming a second 

chamber (18) juxtaposed to the first chamber (7); and 
said third body (22) comprising means of fixing it to the 

neck of the bottle, means of joining it to the assembly 
formed by the first and second bodies (4,14) and a cap 

(24) for closing the assembly, said cap being linked to 
the third body (22) by tearable means (23), characterized 

in that it comprises an element (19), made of a material 
which is resistant to penetration by piercing objects, 

arranged inside the second chamber (18) in such a way 
that it prevents access to the first chamber (7). 
A stopper according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the element which prevents access to the first 

chamber (7) is a sphere (19). 
A stopper according to the previous claims, 
characterized in that the movable plug element (9) comprises 

a cylindrical part (10) which penetrates the 
opening in the seat (8) of the plug element (9), fitting 

in said opening, when the bottle (3) is in the rest 
position. 
A stopper according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the cylindrical part (10) of the plug element (9) 

comprises a peripheral channel (11) into which fits the 
seat (8) of the opening. 
A stopper according to the previous claims, 
characterized in that it comprises a plurality of 

inclined flexible elements (21) arranged between the 
second body (14) and the plurality of openings (5) in the 

first chamber (7) of the first body (4), said inclined 
elements (21) moving in order to allow the liquid inside 

to come out and to prevent the entrance of liquids from 
the outside. 
A stopper according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the plurality of inclined flexible elements (21) are 

inside the first body (4) and arranged in such a way that 
they are inaccessible from the outside.
