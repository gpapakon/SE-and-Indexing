<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method for identifying cancer 
therapeutics, comprising the steps of: (a) combining in 

a GAP assay compatible solution a compound suspected of 
being a cancer therapeutic, ras p21 protein having GAP 

stimulatable GTPase activity, and labelled GTP, the GAP 
optionally having a reduced molecular weight of about 

115,000-120,000 daltons or the GAP comprising a molecule 
having a reduced molecular weight of about 45-55,000 

daltons and being a fragment derived from a molecule 
having a reduced molecular weight of about 115,000-120,000 

daltons; (b) measuring the amount of GTP 
converted to GDP plus phosphate; and (c) relating the 

amount of GTP converted to GDP with a control sample 
prepared in accordance with step "a", said control sample 

being known to be free of said suspected cancer 
therapeutic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of oncology, and particularly to 
compositions useful in diagnostic testing for cancer. More specifically, the invention 
concerns DNA sequences, and compositions containing the same, that can be 
employed as cancer diagnostics. Several genes have been identified that are thought to play a role in 
regulating normal cell growth. A subset of these genes, termed ras, consists of at 
least three members, N-ras, H-ras, and K-ras2. Altered forms of ras, termed 
oncogenes, have been implicated as causative agents in cancer. Both the normal 
cellular genes and the oncogenes encode chemically related proteins, generically 
referred to as p21. Ras oncogenes, and their normal cellular counterparts, have been cloned and 
sequenced from a variety of species. Comparison of the structure of these two genes 
has revealed that they differ by point mutations that alter the amino acid sequence of 
the p21 protein. Naturally occurring mutations in the ras oncogenes have been 
identified in codons 12, 13, 59, and 61. Invitro mutagenesis work has shown that 
mutations in codon 63, 116, 117 and 119 also result in transforming activity. The 
most frequently observed mutation which converts a normal cellular ras gene into its 
oncogenic counterpart is a substitution of glycine at position 12 by any other amino 
acid residue, with the exception of proline. Transforming activity is also observed if 
glycine is deleted, or if amino acids are inserted between alanine at position 11 and 
glycine at position 12. Mutations at position 61 also play an important role in the generation of ras 
oncogenes. Substitution of glutamine for ay other amino acid, except proline or 
glutamic acid in the cellular ras gene yields ras oncogenes with transforming activity. In relation to normal cellular ras genes and their oncogenic counterparts, 
there are at least four known retroviral ras oncogenes which exhibit transforming 
activity. Unlike their non-retroviral analogues, the retroviral genes exhibit two 
mutations. The biological significance of these double mutations is at present  
 
unclear. Both the normal ras and oncogenic p21 proteins, regardless of their 
phylogenetic origin, bind guanine nucleotides, GTP and GDP, and possess intrinsic 
GTPase activity. See Temeles etal., 1985 Nature, 313:700. The significance of 
these biochemical properties to the biological activities of the ras proteins has been 
demonstrated as follows: first, microinjection of anti-ras antibodies that interfere with 
gua
