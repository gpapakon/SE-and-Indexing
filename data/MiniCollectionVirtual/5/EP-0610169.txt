<ABSTRACT>
Meatballs for soups, patties ("mignonnettes") or other round objects of extrudable material which may be made in a device comprising a filling body (1) equipped with several round orifices (4), a sliding plate (7) applied against the bottom plate by means of a spring and provided with openings (8) which may slide above the aforementioned orifices, a driving mechanism (9) having a crank-handle transmission mechanism which moves the sliding plate (7) in order to open and close the said orifices (4). The extrudable material is normally ejected downwards in the form of balls. However, when a predetermined pressure is exceeded, the stream of chopped meat pushes the sliding plate back downwards despite the opposing force exerted by the spring (15) and part of the chopped-meat stream escapes via the interstice formed between the bottom plate and the sliding plate.
