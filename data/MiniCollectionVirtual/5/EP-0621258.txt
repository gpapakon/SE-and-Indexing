<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymerizable 
compound which has both an alpha-ketoester group and a 
polymerizable double bond, and a polymer prepared therefrom. It has been known that an alpha-ketoester group 
is a chemically active group which can be 
ester-exchanged with an active hydrogen containing-compound, 
such as an alcohol or an amine, or can be easily hydrolyzed. If the alpha-ketoester group is introduced into a 
polymer, the polymer would be of chemically interesting. In 
order to obtain such polymers, a compound which has both an 
alpha-ketoester group and a polymerizable double bond is 
inevitable. EP 20,000 B1 and NL 6612666 disclose number of a 
compounds which have both an alpha-ketoester group and a 
polymerizable double bond in the form of general formula, 
but actually synthetic examples are very few. The present invention provides a novel compound 
which has both an alpha-ketoester group and a polymerizable 
double bond. The compound has the formula (I);

A - X - COCOOR₁   (I)


 
   [wherein A represents a C₁ - C₁₈ alkenyl, alkynyl, 
alkenylaryl or alkenylaralkyl group, or a group  
 
represented by; 
   (wherein R₂ and R₃, which is the same or different, 
represents a hydrogen atom, or a C₁ - C₅ alkyl 
group, Y represents an oxygen atom or -NR₄-, in 
which R₄ represents a hydrogen atom or a C₁ - C₅ 
alkyl group, n is an integer of 1 to 5, m is an 
integer of 1 to 10 and ℓ is 0 or an integer of 1 to 
20.);
 
   R₁ represents a hydrogen atom, a C₁ - C₅ alkyl 
group or an aryl group; and
 
   X represents an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, -COO-or 
-NR₅-, in which R₅ is a hydrogen atom or a C₁ - 
C₅ alkyl group, provided that if Y is existent, X 
is not -NR₅-.]
 
   The present invention also provides a production of 
the above compound and polymers prepared therefrom. The present invention further provides a curable 
composition which contains the polymer from the above 
compound. The polymerizable compound of the present invention 
can be prepared by reacting an active hydrogen-containing 
compound represented the formula;

A - XH   (II)

 
 
   [wherein A and X are the same as mentioned above.] 
with an ester compound represented by the formula;

Z - COCOOR₁   (III)


 
   [wherein R₁ is the same as mentioned above and Z 
represents a halogen atom or -OR₁-.] The active hydrogen-containing compound (II) is a 
compound which has a hydrogen atom directly bonded to an 
electrphilic atom or group (e.g. oxygen, sulfur, -NR₄- or 
-COO-). Accordingly, the active hydrogen may be present
