<ABSTRACT>
C3 and higher olefins are oligomerized using a two component catalyst system comprising (a) a soluble adduct of zirconium tetrahalide, the halogen being Br or Cl, with an organic compound selected from the group of esters, ketones, ethers, amines, nitriles, anhydrides, acid chlorides, amides or aldehydes, the organic compound having up to about 30 carbon atoms and (b) an alkyl metal selected from the group R2AlX, RAlX2, R3Al2X3, R3Al and R2Zn where R is C1-C20 alkyl and X is Cl or Br. ZrCl4 adducts with organic acetates are the preferred embodiments. Dimers, trimers and tetramers are selectively prepared in the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR OLIGOMERIZING C3 AND HIGHER OLEFINS USING ZIRCONIUM ADDUCTS AS CATALYSTSThis invention relates to an improved process for oligo erizing C3 and higher olefins. More particu¬ larly, this invention relates to the production of such oligomers of higher olefins utilizing an adduct of zirco¬ nium tetrahalides as an essential part of the homogeneous catalyst system.The oligomerization of ethylene to produce linear alpha-olefins is generally known in the art. The use of zirconium-containing catalysts is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents 4,486,615; 4,442,309; 4,434,313; 4,434,312; 4,410,750; 4,409,409; 4,396,788; 4,377,720 and 4,361,714. A number of these patents disclose reaction products of zirconium halides to provide zirconium alkoxides or carboxylates, such as U.S. Patents 4,409,409 and 4,486,615 which show various derivatives of tetrava- lent zirconium. The concept of the present invention, use of zirconium tetrahalide (bromide, chloride or mixtures thereof) adducts of certain organic compounds, preferably certain alkyl acetate esters, as a catalyst for oligomer¬ ization of C3 and higher olefins, is not disclosed by these references.Japanese Application 60-137683, filed June 25, 1985 by Shiroki et al. and published January 6, 1987 as Japanese Kokai 62-000430, discloses the production of linear alpha-olefins by polymerizing ethylene in the presence of a mixture consisting of a zirconium halide, an alkyl aluminum halide and a compound which may be that of sulfur or that of nitrogen. The catalyst is described as a three component catalyst. 

 U.S. Patent 3,622,552, issued November 23, 1971 to Fu uda et al. discloses the preparation of crystalline homo- or co-polymers of olefin using a three component catalyst comprising (1) an organoaluminum compound of the formula lR2 R being a hydrocarbyl, X being halogen, (2) a Group IV, V or VI transition metal halide and (3) a saturated or unsaturated carboxylic ester having a side chain on a carbon atom in alpha position to ester carbon atoms. Fukuda et al. do not disclose the preparation of linear alpha-olefin oligomers and do not disclose the formation of a homogeneous two component catalyst, one component of which being an adduct of zirconium tetra¬ halide with an organic compound.U.S. Patent 4,855,525, issued August 8, 1989, to the inventors hereof, discloses the use of zirconium tetrahalide adducts as catalysts for the production of linear alpha-olefins from ethylene. The present invention is based on the discovery that the same zirconium halide
