<ABSTRACT>
A device for hinging a door (3, 4) of a built-in household 
electrical appliance (1), such as a refrigerator, to a door panel 

(10, 11) of a furniture item (2) containing it, comprises hinge 
means having a part (14) fixed to the furniture item (2) and/or to 

the appliance and a part associated with its door panel (10, 11), 
this latter comprising elastic return means (30) for self-closure 

of the door panel (10, 11) when it exceeds a dead point during its 
movement, the part (14) fixed to the furniture item (2) supporting 

constraint means (18) for the appliance door (3, 4) about which 
this latter rotates to open or close, drag means (36, 38) for the 

door (3, 4) being associated with this latter and with the door 
panel (10, 11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for hinging and connecting a door of a built-in
household electrical appliance, such as an upright
refrigerator, to a door panel of a furniture item housing the door
panel, the door panel being in a position corresponding with said
door.In the case of a built-in household electrical appliance it is
desirable and necessary to achieve maximum utilization of the
space in the furniture item housing the appliance.There are various known methods of achieving this and allowing
easy opening both of the door panel of the furniture item and of
the door of the appliance (or of each door with which it is
provided and each door panel relative to it).For example a double-parallelogram hinge is known from
EP-A-0565900, from which the preamble of claim 1 is known, such
hinge on opening the door panel of the furniture item causes this panel to
undergo an initial movement parallel to itself so as to separate it from
the door of the appliance (for example an upright refrigerator),
after which it allows both the door panel and the refrigerator
door to rotate about relative hinging points.Although this method achieves optimum utilization of the furniture
item housing the refrigerator, it has various drawbacks including
a high cost which negatively affects the cost of assembling the
furniture item containing the appliance (for example a kitchen
furniture unit); in addition the hinge is of considerable overall
dimensions, involving obvious storage and installation problems, and is
not easily adjustable.It is also known to use two separate hinges for opening the
refrigerator door and the door panel of the furniture item. This 
method does not however achieve optimum utilization of the space
in the furniture item housing the appliance.An object of the present invention is to provide a device of the
aforesaid type which is of simple, low-cost construction and
allows maximum utilization of the space housing the appliance.This object is realised by the characterising features of claim 1.This and further objects which will be apparent to the expert of
the art are attained by a device in accordance with the
accompanying claims.The present invention will be more apparent from the accompanying
drawing, which is provided by way of example and in which:
Figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of a household electrical
appliance built into a furniture item, these latter comprising
doors and door panels connected together by the device of the
invention;Figure 2 is an exploded partial perspective view of

<CLAIMS>
A device for hinging and connecting a door (3) of a built-in
household electrical appliance (1), such as a refrigerator, to a door

panel (10, 11) of a furniture item (2) containing the said appliance,
and comprising hinge means having a body (14) provided with two

sides (14A, 14B) respectively fixeable to a face of a furniture wall
(5) and the built-in appliance (1), whereby the plane of the said

furniture wall face is directed substantially perpendicular to the
front face of the built in appliance (1), by which sides the body (14)

is in use fixed to the furniture item (2) and/or to the appliance (1)
whereby the said sides (14A, 14B) are connected together by at

least one projecting flange (17), the hinge means further
comprising a hinging member (24) constituted of a terminal

member in use associated with the furniture item door panel
(10, 11) and a parallelogram hinge link for providing a combined

motion such that on opening the door panel (10, 11) the hinging
member (24) causes the door panel (10, 11) to initially separate

from the said wall (5) of the furniture item (2) to allow easy opening
and rotation of the door panel (10, 11), the said body (14)

supporting constraint means for the appliance door (3) about which
this latter rotates to open or close and whereby the said constraint

means is constituted by a pin (18) supporting the appliance door
(3) and projecting from that face (20) of the said at

least one projecting flange (17) facing one of the opposite edges of
the door (3) of the appliance (1), the device further comprising drag

means (36, 38) to be associated with the door panel (10, 11) and the
appliance door (3), e.g. a slide (36) and a guide (38) cooperating

with each other, such that the appliance door (3) is dragged open
when the door panel (10, 11) is pulled open, characterised in

that said hinging member (24) is further constituted of a
terminal element (23), whereby the said parallelogram hinge link

links the terminal element (23) with the said terminal member,
the hinging member (24) further comprising an elastic return

means (30) for automatic closure or opening of the furniture item
door panel (10, 11) when it exceeds a dead point during its

movement, the terminal element (23)
cooperating in an adjustable manner with

a guide projection (21) projecting from that face (22) of the said
body side (14A) to be fixed to the said furniture wall (5) which

faces away from the furniture wall (5), the adjustment providing
a guided movement along the said face (22) of the body side (14A)

fixed to the said furniture wall (5).
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the projection is
being arranged to cooperate, in order to guide its  

movement along the face (22), with the element (23) of the hinging
member (24) by means of a screw enabling said member (24) and said

body (14) to be associated with each other in an adjustable manner, said
screw being arranged to cooperate with a slot (28) provided in the element

(23) and with a hole (29) provided in the raised part (21).
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the drag means
comprises a slide (36) associated with the appliance door to sliding

cooperate with a guide element (38) associated with the door panel.
