<ABSTRACT>
An armrest (42), for use between adjacent seats in 
a row of seats, is movable between a deployed position, and 

a stowed position. The armrest (42) is secured to a 
carriage (56) which is slidably mounted on a track (48) 

located between the backrests of the adjacent seats. The 
carriage (56) movable on the track (48) between an upper 

position in which the armrest (42) is at a desired level 
for use and a lower position in which the armrest is level 

with the seat cushions 84 of the seat. A releasable 
latching bolt (70) secures the carriage (56) in its upper 

position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an armrest for use 
between adjacent seats in a row of seats, the armrest being 
movable between a deployed position and a stowed position 
in which the upper surface of the armrest is level with the 
seat cushions of the adjacent seats. An armrest of this 
type is particularly applicable to passenger seats for use 
in an aircraft. A known armrest of this type is supported on two 
pivotable links forming a parallelogram-type mechanism 
allowing the armrest to be moved between its deployed 
position and its stowed position. The present invention is 
concerned with the provision of an armrest of the type 
described above, using a simpler mechanism. According to the invention, an armrest of the type 
described above is secured to a carriage which is slidably 
mounted on a track located between the backrests of 
adjacent seats, the carriage being movable on the track 
between an upper position in which the armrest is at a 
desired level for use and a lower position in which the 
armrest is level with the seat cushions of the seat, 
releasable locking means being arranged to secure the 
carriage in its upper position. The track may be of rectangular cross-section and 
the carriage may have a first guide member arranged to 
engage with one edge of the track and a second guide member 
arranged to engage with an opposite edge of the track. 
Preferably, there are two such guide members engaging with 
each of said edges of the track. Preferably, the locking means is releasable by 
manually actuable release means mounted on the armrest. 
The locking means may comprise a bolt mounted on the 
armrest and spring biassed towards the track so as to be 
engageable with a detent formation thereon. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view showing a number of  
 
rows of seating units, each consisting of three seats; Figure 2 is a partially broken away side view 
showing an armrest in accordance with the invention fitted 
to one of the seat units shown in Figure 1, with the 
armrest in its deployed position; Figure 3 is a scrap plan view of the upper end of 
the support mechanism for the armrest shown in Figure 2; 
and Figure 4 is a side view, similar to Figure 2, but 
showing the armrest in its stowed position. Figure 1 shows four adjacent seating units 10, 11, 
12 and 13. The seating unit 11 will be described in more 
detail, by way of example, but it should be understood that

<CLAIMS>
An armrest for use between adjacent seats in a row 
of seats, the armrest (42) being movable between a deployed 

position, and a stowed position in which the upper surface 
of the armrest (42) is level with the seat cushions of the 

adjacent seats, characterised in that the armrest (42) is 
secured to a carriage (56) which is slidably mounted on a 

track (48) located between the backrests of the adjacent 
seats, the carriage (56) being movable on the track (48) 

between an upper position in which the armrest (42) is at 
a desired level for use and a lower position in which the 

armrest (42) is level with the seat cushions of the seat, 
and releasable locking means (74) for securing the carriage 

(56) in its upper position. 
An armrest according to claim 1, wherein the track 
(48) is of rectangular cross-section and the carriage (56) 

has a first guide member (62) arranged to engage with one 
edge of the track (48) and a second guide member (66) 

arranged to engage with an opposite edge of the track (48). 
An armrest according to claim 2, wherein the 
carriage (56) has a third guide member (64) arranged to 

engage with said one edge of the track (48) and a fourth 
guide member (60) arranged to engage with said opposite 

edge of the track (48). 
An armrest according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein 
the locking means (70) is releasable by manually actuable 

release means (82) mounted on the armrest (42). 
An armrest according to claim 4, wherein the 
locking means comprises a bolt (70) mounted on the armrest 

(42) and spring biassed towards the track (48) so as to be 
engageable with a detent formation (72) thereon.
