<ABSTRACT>
In a TDMA cellular communication network, one of the cell 
sites (2) is a reference station (2) for establishing a time 

reference in response to a timing signal from a mobile 
switching office (1), and each of the other cell sites (3) 

is a subordinate station (3). Each subordinate station (3) 
establishes a time slot in response to the timing signal 

from the mobile switching system and receives a signal from 
a mobile station (5) located in the area of the reference 

station (2) for detecting a time lapse between the time slot 
and the signal from the mobile station (5). A delay time is 

introduced to the time slot according to the time lapse so 
that the time slot is synchronized to the time reference of 

the reference station (2). In a second embodiment, each 
subordinate station (3) transmits a signal indicative of the 

detected time lapse to the mobile switching system, where a 
delay time value is derived from those signals received from 

a chain of subordinate stations (3) and returned to each 
subordinate station (3) for performing the time slot 

adjustment. The delay time value is a modulo τ summation of 
the time lapses received from such chain of subordinate 

stations (3), where τ is the duration of the time slot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to network synchronization,
and more specifically to synchronization for a TDMA (time division multiple
access) cellular communication network.According to a known synchronization technique for a digital
cellular communication network, a reference cell site broadcasts a reference
timing signal at periodic intervals over radio propagation paths using a
dedicated transmitter or via respective land-lines. A plurality of subordinate
cell sites are provided with a dedicated receiver for receiving the timing
signal to adjust their slot timing. However, it is impossible to provide
precision timing adjustment due to the inherent differences in
distance between the reference cell site and the
subordinate cell sites.EP-A-0 131 662 relates to a distributed network
synchronization system. The digital transmission system
comprises a central station and a plurality of remote
stations, each station including means for transmitting
and receiving digital data in a sequence of frames, and
transmission means arranged between said central station
and each of said remote stations and causing a variable
inherent delay therebetween dependent upon the location
of the respective remote station. In this system, the
central station sends a first signal to each of a
plurality of remote stations in turn and receives a
return signal. The central station produces a delay
control signal from the first signal and the return
signal and transmits the delay control signal to the
remote station. In response, the remote station adjusts
its time of transmission according to the delay control
signal. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a
network synchronization technique which no longer suffers from the prior
art disadvantages. This object is achieved by the features of independent claims 1 and 8,
respectively.According to a first aspect, the present invention provides a TDMA
cellular communication network comprising a mobile switching system, and
a plurality of cell site stations connected via respective paths to the mobile
switching system for receiving a reference timing signal therefrom. One of
the cell site stations is a reference station for establishing a time reference in
response to the received reference timing signal, and each of the remainder
cell site stations is a subordinate station. Each of the subordinate stations
establishes a time slot in response to the reference timing signal from the
mobile switching system and receives a signal from a mobile station which
