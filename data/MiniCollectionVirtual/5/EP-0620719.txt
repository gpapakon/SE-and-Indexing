<ABSTRACT>
A tonometer for measuring the intra-ocular pressure of an eye comprising an emitter (12) for emitting a signal towards the eye, a receiver (14) for receiving the signal on being reflected from the eye and a monitoring device (15) for monitoring the amplitude of the signal received by the receiver (14). The emitter (12) and receiver (14) are movable relative to the eye. The monitoring device (15) takes the measurement when the distance between the eye and receiver (14) is such that the strongest signal is received.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TONOMETERThis invention relates to a tonometer for measuring Intra-ocular pressure.Tonometry is the corrmon procedure for measuring the Intra-ocular pressure of the eye. Many known tonometric assessments require the use of anaesthesia and contact with the eye or a short blast of high pressure air to be directed at the eye. These known methods cause a sensation in the eye resulting in discomfort to the patient. What is more contact with the eye may result in abrasion and cross infection. Repeated mesurements comprising contact with the eye also have a massaging effect on the eye which may adversely affect the accuracy of subsequent measurements .US 4945913 and US 4930507 describe tonometers for determining the Intra-ocular pressure of an eye in which the eye is dynamically sealed within a chamber and the pressure of the chamber is measured as a frequency range of sound waves are directed at the eye. The resonant response of the eye, which is related to the Intra-ocular pressure, will have a direct effect on the overall resonant response of the system. The change in pressure in the chamber is 

 related to the resonant response of the system. The dynamic seal, which is essential if chamber pressure is to be measured accurately, is difficult to achieve as the apparatus Is placed in direct contact with the face. This contact is found to be disconce ting by many patients .US 4928697 describes a tonometer for determining the Intra-ocular pressure of an eye in which high and low frequency sound waves are directed toward the cornea and reflected therefrom. The output signals created by amplitude modulation of the reflected sound waves are directly related to the Intra-ocular pressure of the eye. The wave source must be located a fixed distance from the eye and this is achieved by the patient placing his head adjacent a chin and forehead support. This may be uncomfortable for the patient.The present invention has been made from a consideration of these problems.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a tonometer for measuring the Intra-ocular pressure of an eye comprising an emitter for emitting a signal towards the eye, a receiver for receiving the signal on being reflected from the eye, and a monitoring device for monitoring the amplitude of the signal received by the receiver, 

 wherein the emitter and/or receiver is movable relative to the eye while the monitoring device is operating, the monitoring device comprising means for taking and/or storing a measurement when the

CLAIMS
1. A tonometer for measuring the Intra-ocular pressure of an eye comprising an emitter for emitting a signal towards the eye, a receiver for receiving the signal on being reflected from the eye, and a monitoring device for monitoring the amplitude of the signal received by the receiver, wherein the emitter and/or receiver is movable relative to the eye while the monitoring device is operating, the monitoring device comprising means for taking and/or storing a measurement wherein the distance between the eye and the receiver is such that substantially the strongest signal is received.
2. A tonometer as claimed in claim 1, wherein the signal comprises an ultrasound wave.
3. A tonometer as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the frequency of the signal is substantially 40 KHz.
4. A tonometer as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the means for taking and/or storing a measurement takes the measurement when the strongest signal is emitted.
5. A tonometer as claimed in any preceding claim, 


wherein the transmitter and receiver are arranged in a concentric manner.
6. A tonometer as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the reciver extends beyond the transmitter.
7. A method for receiving the Intra-ocular pressure of the eye using the apparatus of any of claims 1 to 6.
8. A method of monitoring the Intra-ocular pressure of an eye, comprising directing a signal towards the eye, collecting the signal reflected from the eye and monitoring the amplitude of the collected signal, wherein the emitter and/or receiver is movable relative to the eye while the monitoring device is operating, the monitoring device comprising means for taking and/or storing a measurement when the distance between the eye and the receiver is such that substantially the strongest signal is received.
