<ABSTRACT>
A method for sealing a tray (1) by means of a lid (3), the lid consisting of a paperboard material, and the tray of a plastic material or of a plastic-laminated paperboard and being particularly intended for storing and heating food. The lid (3) is provided with an opening (6) and is adhesively secured to a plastic film (7). The lid is then, together with its plastic film, welded to the tray. The adhesive securing is so dimensioned that the adhesion between the lid and the plastic film will be weaker than the weld seal between the film and the tray, such that the lid - without being heated and without causing any loosening of the plastic film from the tray - can be removed from the plastic film after this has been welded to the tray. The side of the plastic film that faces the tray is coated with a layer of so-called peel-off-type which enables a removal of the film after this has been welded to the tray.

<DESCRIPTION>
A method for sealing a tray by means of a lidFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a method for sealing a tray by means of a lid, the lid consisting of a paperboard material, and the tray consisting of a plastic material or of a plastic-laminated paperboard and being particularly intended for storing and heating food.BACKGROUND ARTSuch a method is known from SE-B-464.629. This known method involves a fastening of the lid to the tray by interposing therebetween a plastic film which is, in one single opera¬ tion, welded to the lid and to the tray as well. That method has the following disadvantages.A rather complicated heating tool is required at every place where food is to be packaged into the tray. It must be able to accomplish, in one single operation, a feeding of the plastic film and simultaneously welding it against the tray and against the lid as well.That method will also result in a so strong bond between the lid and the plastic film that they can be removed from the tray only together as one unit. Therefore, it will not be possible for the consumer to separate the paperboar lid from the plastic film, which is of course a serious problem when taking into account environmental aspects in waste disposal.In many cases where the food has to be warmed in an oven i is prescribed that the tray must be sealed also during the warming. With the known method, this would mean that the entire contents of the tray can not be visually observed by the consumer, since the paperboard member will obstruct 

any visual observation of the contents. There will also be a risque that the paperboard portion of the lid - in case it is left on the tray during the heating thereof - can be discoloured or emit unpleasant sulphite odour. In order to eliminate the lastmentioned problem the known method would require that a paperboard material of a very high and ex¬ pensive quality always had to be used.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe object of the present invention is, therefore, to pro¬ vide a method of the aforementioned kind, where all said disadvantages have been eliminated. This object will be achieved by a method according to the invention and having the characteristics set forth in Claim 1.Further developments of the invention are set forth in the subclaims.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGThe drawing provides a schematical perspective view of a heating tool and a tray which is being sealed by the me¬ thod according to the invention.PREFERRED EMBODIMENTIn the drawing, a tray 1 of plastic is illustrated, for

C l a i s
1. A method for sealing a tray by means of a lid, the lid consisting of a paperboard material, and the tray consis- ting of a plastic material or of a plastic-laminated paper¬ board and being particularly intended for storing and heat¬ ing food, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that a) the lid (3) is provided with at least one window ope- ning (6) in order to enable a visual observation of any contents of- the tray (1) , b) a transparent plastic film (7) is adhesively secured to the tray side of the lid by means of a heat resistant adhesive substance (8) such that the film will cover the window opening (6) , c) the tray (1) is filled with said contents, d) the lid (3) and the plastic film (7) adhered thereto is placed over the opening edge (2) of the tray with the plastic film (7) facing the tray (1) , whereafter the plas- tic film is heat sealed to the opening edge (2) of the tray by welding, and that e) said adhesive securing is dimensioned such that the adhesion between the lid (3) and the plastic film (7) will be weaker than the weld seal between the film and the tray (1) , such that the lid - without having to be heated and without causing any loosening of the plastic film from the tray - can be completely or partially removed from the plastic film after this has been welded to the tray.
2. A method according to Claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i ¬ z e d in that the tray side of the transparent plastic film (7) is suitably of a so-called peel-off-type.
3. A method according to any preceding Claim, c h a - r a c t e r i z e d in that the plastic film (7) is pro¬ vided with portions (7a, 7b) protruding outwards from the 


lid (3) in order to form tabs for said removal of the plastic film from the tray.
