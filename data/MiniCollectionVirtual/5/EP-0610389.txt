<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a safety switch intended to be connected into a safety circuit for an industrial machine, for example an industrial robot. The switch comprises a contact device (2) with a hand-operated device (3, 4) in which a pressure rod (31) is displaceable against the action of a return spring (33) from a first end position via an operating position to a second end position, the safety circuit being closed only in the operating position. During the return movement of the pressure rod from its second to its first end position, the contact device (2) is not affected, and the safety circuit thus remains open during the whole of this return movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hand-operated safety
switch of the kind described in the preamble to claim 1. The
safety switch is primarily intended to be used in applications
in the engineering industry, for example in an industrial
robot application where persons are present within the
operating range of the robot.An industrial robot can be controlled with the aid of a
joystick. During a teaching or programming procedure, the
position and/or orientation of the robot tool can be controlled
in the desired manner by means of the joystick. The
joystick can either be arranged on a fixed control cabinet
or on a smaller, separate programming unit, which during
programming or teaching can be held in the hand or be placed
on a table. In order that programming shall not take an unreasonably
long time, it is necessary that a full deflection
of the joystick causes a movement with a relatively high
speed of response in the robot. During the teaching procedure
it may be necessary for personnel to stay in the
vicinity of the robot. In order to eliminate the risks of
injuries which arise in this connection, a safety plate is
arranged on programming units of the above-mentioned kind,
on which safety plate the operator's hand rests when operating
the joystick with the aid of the fingers. When the hand
is removed, the safety plate senses this and influences the
control system such that the joystick is rendered inoperative.
In this way, it is prevented that an unintentional
contact with the joystick gives rise to a movement of the
robot. A device of this kind is described in Swedish printed
patent application 450 285 and in Asea Journal 1982, No. 6,
pp. 145-150. In the known device there may be a certain risk that the
operator, in an emergency situation, reacts incorrectly and
instead of removing his hand from the safety plate presses
even harder, whereby the robot continues its movement with
an ensuing risk of both material damage and personal injury.
To avoid this it has been proposed to use a contact device,
actuated by the safety device, with two end positions located
on different sides of an operating position, one of the
end positions constituting the initial position (the rest
position) and the other end position an extra neutral position.
A drawback with this design, however, is that the
contact device while returning to the initial position has
to pass the operating position, whereby the safety circuit
is briefly closed with an ensuing risk of uncontrolled movements
of the robot.A safety switch of the

A safety switch for an industrial machine, intended to be
connected into an emergency stop circuit for the machine

and comprising a contact device (2), mounted in a housing
(1), with a hand-operated device (3, 4) for switching the

contact device between an open position, in which the safety
switch is open, and a closed position, in which the safety

circuit is closed, the contact device comprising a spring
(24) for permanently influencing the contact device in a direction

towards the open position, the hand-operated device
(3, 4) comprising a pressure operating member (31) which is

displaceable against the action of a return spring (33) from
a first end position (Fig. 1) via a mid-position (Fig. 3) to

a second end position (Fig. 4), the pressure operating member
(31) being connected to the contact device (2) in such a

way that the contact device assumes the open position when
the operating member is in its end positions and the closed

position when the operating member is in its mid-position,

characterized
 in that to prevent the contact
device (2) from being influenced by the operating member

(31) when this member returns from its second to its first
end position the hand-operated device (3, 4) comprises a

lever arm (4), rotatably journalled in the housing, for
transmitting operating force from the pressure operating

member (31) to the contact device (2), the lever arm making
contact at one of its end portions with a side surface of

the pressure operating member (31) through a resilient member
(42, 43) and at its other end portion with an actuating

member (23) associated with the contact device, that the
pressure operating member (31) has a recess (36) which is

adapted such that, together with the resilient member (42,
43) of the lever arm, it effects a coupling engagement between

the operating member (31) and the lever arm (4) during
the displacement of the operating member from its first end 

position to its mid-position, but which, during continued
displacement of the operating member (31) from the mid-position

towards the second end position, permits the resilient
member (42, 43) to be pressed out of the recess (36),

whereby the lever arm (4) is disengaged from the operating
member (31).
A safety switch according to claim 1, characterized in
that the resilient member comprises a ball (43) which is

pressed by a compression spring (42) against said side surface
of the pressure operating member (31).
A safety switch according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the pressure operating

member (31) comprises a pressure rod which is longitudinally
displaceable in a bearing hole (12) arranged in the housing

(1), the rod (31) being provided with transversally projecting
guide pins (39) which are in engagement with guide

slots (13), arranged in the housing, for limiting the return
movement of the rod and for fixing the rod in the direction

of rotation.
A safety switch according to any of claims 2 or 3
characterized in that the recess in the pressure rod

comprises a deeper portion (36) which is provided at one end
of the pressure rod (31) and which forms a seat for the ball

(43) and which, via a shoulder (37), changes into a
shallower portion (38) which forms a rolling or sliding path

for the ball (43).
A safety switch according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the contact device (2)

consists of a microswitch.
