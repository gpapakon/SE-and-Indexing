<ABSTRACT>
Collection bags for use by urine-incontinent or ostomy-operated individuals, comprising two outer sheet walls, an inlet opening and optionally one or more discharge openings, wherein the two outer sheet walls have interposed between them one or more inner sheet members which are joined with the outer sheet walls and wherein at least one of the inner sheet members has at least one fold between a joint to the inner side of the one and the other outer sheet wall, respectively, when the bag is empty. Processes for producing the collection bags by welding in one or two steps and using temporary or permanent welding-preventing elements. The collection bags have a substantially flat shape and a substantially plane surface, so that the area extent of the bag is utilized optimally in terms of volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns collection bags for use by 
urine-incontinent or ostomy-operated individuals, said 
collection bags having at least one inlet opening and optionally 
one or more discharge openings. Collection bags of the above-mentioned type may be formed 
from a sheet tube or a sheet member which is folded centrally 
in longitudinal or transverse directions to form 
two outer sheet walls, the open ends or edges of the sheet 
tube or the sheet member being closed by joining, preferably 
by glueing or welding. The collection bag which has been used most extensively 
for many years is a bag consisting of two weldable sheets 
which, apart from openings for inlet and discharge, are 
welded together along their peripheries to form a cavity 
for the collection of urine and/or faeces. Collection bags of this simple design operate excellently 
in reality. However, such a bag is not particularly discrete, 
because when used it bulges very much and is very 
difficult to conceal for the user particularly in a filled 
or almost filled state. Furthermore, the collected human 
vastes, if just a little liquid, will have a great tendency 
to lap when the user moves about, thereby giving 
unpleasant sounds that may have a considerable inhibitory 
effect on the user. In spite of these problems collection bags of the above-mentioned 
design are still used. It has previously been attempted to solve the above-mentioned 
problems by manufacturing collection bags of a  
 
flatter shape. Generally, two types of collection bags are 
known today which essentially have properties reducing the 
tendency of the bag contents to lap, and which do not 
bulge so much as the first-mentioned simple bag. The first type of these "flatter" collection bags has two 
sheet walls optionally consisting of two weldable sheets 
which are welded together along the periphery in the same 
manner as collection bags of the simple design. The two 
sheet walls are additionally welded together at one or 
more spots or in one or more lines, e.g. a longitudinal 
central weld. This type of collection bag has a relatively 
flat shape which makes it easier for the user to conceal 
it under the clothes, and the flat shape of the bag as 
well as the division into chambers entail that the tendency 
of the bag contents to lap is reduced considerably. 
A collection bag of this type is known e.g. from DK published 
application 113 595. Thus, such a collection bag of the last-mentioned type 
does not bulge in one big bulge when the bag is filled or 
alm
