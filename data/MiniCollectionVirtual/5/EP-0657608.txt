<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a fitting for a frame-free pivot window or a flap on a caravan, having at least one pair of interacting locking elements, of which one is fastened on the window and the other is provided on an opening of the reveal and one of the two locking elements can be moved relative to the other locking element, and having an actuating lever which is fastened rotatably on the window and is intended for the movable locking element. In order that a fitting is provided, for a frame-free pivot window or a flap, which makes the closure thereof considerably more simple, it is provided that the actuating lever (62) is a crank connected in a rotationally fixed manner to a toothed disc (64), and that an elongate transmission member (20; 100) is guided in a longitudinally displaceable manner in a rail (12; 90) fastened on the reveal (1), on which transmission member the reveal-side locking element (30; 110) is fastened and a rack (72; 112) is formed, the toothed disc (64) engaging into the rack (72; 112) during the actuation of the crank.

Fittings for a frameless pivot window or a flap on a 
caravan with at least a pair of locking elements (30, 40) 

with combined effect, one of which is fixed to the window 
(50) and the other one is provided for on an opening of the 

jamb (1), one of both locking elements (30) being movable 
with regard to the other locking element (40), as well as 

with an operating lever (62) for the movable locking 
element (30), rotatably fixed to the window (50), 

characterized therein that the operating lever (62) is a 
crank bound to a tooth disc (64) in a manner resistant to 

torsion and that, in a rail (12; 90) fixed to the jamb (1), 
a longitudinally streched transfer element (20; 100), 

movable in longitudinal direction, is carried, to which the 
locking element on the jamb side (30; 110) is fixed, a 

tooth strip (72; 112) being shaped on it as well, and the 
tooth disc (64) is meshing with the tooth strip (72; 112) 

when operating the crank. 
Fittings according to claim 1, characterized therein that 
the tooth strip (72, 112) is fixed to the transfer element 

(20; 100). 
Fittings according to claim 1 or 2, characterized therein 
that on both sides of the operating lever (62) at least one 

pair of locking elements (30, 40) with combined effect are 
respectively provided for and that the transfer element 

(20; 100) extends on both sides of the tooth strip (72; 
112). 
Fittings according to one or several preceding claims, 
characterized therein that the transfer element (20; 100) 

is a steel strip which can be bent transversely to its 
longitudinal extension. 
Fittings according to one or several preceding claims, 
characterized therein that the locking element (30) on the 

jamb side shows an inside bolt (34) and an outside bolt  
 

(36) whose interval to each other allows an intervention of 
-the other locking element (40, 42), the tooth strip (72) 

being enlarged by about as much as the interval. 
Fittings according to one or several preceding claims, 
characterized in that the transfer element (100) is 

provided with series of holes (102, 104, 106) spaced from 
each other by the same interval into which the locking 

elements (110) on the jamb side can be fixed like clips. 
Fittings according to one or several preceding claims, 
characterized therein that the locking elements (110) on 

the jamb side are provided with claws (111, 113, 115, 117) 
on their underside, which encompass the lateral webs 

provided for on the strip (90). 
Fittings according to one or several preceding claims, 
characterized therein that the tooth strip (112) is 

provided with at least one closing (123, 125) having a 
combined effect with the tooth disc (64). 
Fittings according to one or more preceding claims, 
characterized therein that the strip (90) is fixed to the 

jamb (1) via a profiled joint (86) which encompasses the 
edge of the jamb and shows a sealing 
lip (85) for the pivot 
window (80).
