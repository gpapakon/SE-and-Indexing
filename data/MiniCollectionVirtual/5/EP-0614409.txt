<ABSTRACT>
A safety razor comprises a blade unit (2) mounted on a handle (1) for pivotal movement in one direction from a rest position, the pivot axis (C) being arranged to underly the guard surface (10). In the rest position, the entire handle is disposed forwardly of a plane containing the trailing edge of the guard surface. The handle is pivoted to the blade unit by connection pieces (20; 30) having stub axles (26) engaged in apertures (18) in the blade unit, and edges (28) bearing against cam faces (16) on the blade unit to urge the blade unit to the rest position, the connection pieces being carried by wings (20; 30) either acted upon by springs (24) or having a resilient form.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RAZORSThis invention relates to razors, and is particularly concerned with a safety razor of the kind comprising a handle and a blade unit mounted on the handle with the capability to pivot during shaving to adjust itself to the contours of the surface being shaved, there being spring means acting between the handle and blade unit to urge the blade unit to a "rest" position.In known razors of this kind the pivot axis, as seen in a direction perpendicular to a plane containing the guard surface and the edge of the blade adjacent to the guard, is located between the guard and the cap of the blade unit, i.e. generally behind the blade or blades, and the blade unit is arranged to pivot in both directions from its rest position. With such arrangements the handle tends to impede flow of water through the blade unit for rinsing away soap and shaving debris.In accordance with the present invention there is provided a safety razor comprising a blade unit including a guard and at least one blade, and a handle mounting the blade unit for pivotal movement in one direction only from a rest position, characterised in that the pivot axis underlies the guard surface as seen in a direction normal to a plane containing the guard surface and the edge of the adjacent blade. 

 With the pivot axis located to underly the guard surface, the force of the blades against the skin during shaving will be mainly influenced by the spring means which opposes pivotal displacement of the blade unit from the rest position and applies a restoring force to return the blade unit to the rest position when it has been deflected from that position. As a consequence if the user wishes to apply more force to the guard, for example to stretch the skin, this can be done without increasing the force of the blades on the skin. This could not be achieved by prior arr razors.In addition, the handle can be arranged so as not to obstruct flow of rinsing water through the blade unit and in accordance with a preferred feature, with the blade unit in the rest position, the handle is located entirely forwardly of a plane containing the edge of the blade adjacent the guard and perpendicular to said plane containing said edge and the guard surface. (For convenience the latter plane is hereinafter referred to as the "top plane" of the blade unit. ) Ideally the handle is located entirely forwardly of a plane containing the trailing edge of the guard surface and perpendicular to the top plane of the blade unit.The blade unit may be pivotally movable through an

 CLAIMS : -
1. A safety razor comprising a blade unit (2) including a guard and at least one blade (6), and a handle (1) mounting the blade unit for pivotal movement in one direction only from a rest position, characterised in that the pivot axis (C) underlies the guard surface (10) as seen in a direction normal to a plane (P) containing the guard surface (10) and the blade edge (12) adjacent thereto.
2. A razor according to claim 1, wherein, when the blade unit is in the rest position, the handle is located entirely forwardly of a plane containing the leading blade edge (12) and perpendicular to said plane (P) containing the guard surface and adjacent blade edge.
3. A razor according to claim 1, wherein, when the blade unit is in the rest position, the handle is located entirely forwardly of a plane containing the trailing edge of the guard surface (10) and perpendicular to said plane (P) containing the guard surface and adjacent blade edge.
4. A razor according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the blade unit (2) is pivotable through an angle in the rraannggee ooff 35 to 50 , preferably 40째 to 45째, from the rest position.
5. A razor according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein, when the blade unit is in the rest position, said plane (P) containing the guard surface and the adjacent blade edge lies at an angle of 20째 to 30째 to the longitudinal axis of the handle. 


 6. A razor according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the pivot axis (C) is from 1.0 to 2.0 mm in front of the leading blade edge (12), measured in said plane (P) containing the guard surface and blade edge.
7. A razor according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the pivot axis (C) is 0.50 to 1.00 mm below the guard surface.
8. A safety razor comprising a blade unit (2), and a handle (1) supporting the blade unit for pivotal movement from a rest position, the handle being connected to the blade unit by a pair of opposed connection pieces (20) engaging the blade unit at the respective ends thereof, characterised in that said connection pieces (20) are urged resiliently into abutment with cam faces (16) on the blade unit (2) whereby to oppose displacement of the blade from the rest position and to apply a restoring force for returning the blade unit to the rest position.
9. A razor according to claim 8, wherein the handle has a pair of wings (20; 30) with tips forming the connection pieces and biased apart by the wings.
10. A razor according to claim 9, wherein the wing tips comprise pivot elements (26) engaged with complementary means (18) on the blade unit to define a fixed pivot axis (C) for the blade unit.
11. A razor according to claim 10, wherein the pivot elements are stud axles (26) engaged in complementary apertures (18) in the blade unit. 


 12. A razor according to claim 10 or 11, wherein the pivot element (16) of each tip is located adjacent to and projects beyond an edge surface (28) in contact with the blade unit cam face.
13. A razor according to any one of claims 9 to 12, wherein the wing tips are received in respective sockets (14) at the ends of the blade unit, the sockets having front and rear stop faces for abutment with the tips to limit the pivotal movement of the blade unit.
14. A razor according to any one of claims 9 to 13, wherein the wings (20) are hinged to the handle and acted upon by spring means (24) to urge the tips apart.
15. A razor according to any one of claims 9 to 13, wherein the wings (30) are resilient and serve as spring means to urge the tips apart.
16. A razor according to claim 15 wherein the wings (30) are integral with the handle.
17. A razor according to any one of claims 9 to 16, wherein the blade unit (2) is detachable from the handle by squeezing the wings together to disengage the wing tips (26) from the blade unit.
