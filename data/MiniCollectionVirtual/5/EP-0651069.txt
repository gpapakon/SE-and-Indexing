<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for applying a friction-reducing
coating providing protection against wear on a
substrate, according to which method at least one
intrinsic diamond-like carbon coating is deposited directly or by means of an intermediate layer on the
substrate by means of a thin-film technique.Methods whereby an intrinsic, amorphous,
diamond-like carbon coating (i-C or a-C) or amorphous
hydrogenated diamond-like carbon coating (a-C:H) is
applied on a substrate of for example steel, offer
interesting advantages since such coatings have a high
hardness, a relatively low coefficient of friction and a
chemical inertness, which results in a good resistance
against wear and corrosion.Such methods are described among others in "Thin Solid
Films" 217 (1992) 56 and "Diamond and Related Materials"
2 (1993) 272.However, the coefficient of friction of such coatings
depends on the surrounding air humidity. Thus, it is
known that the coefficient of friction increases from for
example 0.05 in a dry nitrogen atmosphere or in a very
high vacuum up to a value between 0.15 and 0.4 at a
relative humidity of 50%. The high internal compressive
stress in these diamond-like carbon coatings may also
cause adherence problems, as a result of which the
thickness remains restricted to for example 2000 nm. The invention aims to remedy said disadvantages and to
provide a method for applying a coating on a substrate
providing protection against wear with which a coating
with still better qualities can be obtained and among
others a lower coefficient of friction, independent of
the air humidity.This aim is reached according to the invention as at least one time successively an intrinsic diamond-like carbon coating and on top thereof and in immediate contact of it a
silicon alloyed diamond-like carbon coating (a-Si1-xCx:H) are deposited by means of a
thin-film technique on the substrate or on an
intermediate layer of silicon deposited on the substrate.Surprisingly, it appeared that in this manner the
excellent tribological qualities of both coatings are
combined. The thus obtained multi-layer has, apart from
an exceptionally high resistance against wear which is
typical of the intrinsic diamond-like carbon coating,
also a very low coefficient of friction which is independent
of the prevailing air humidity, such as with a single
silicon alloyed diamond-like carbon coating. Moreover,
the internal stresses of this multi-layer are lower
compared to those of intrinsic diamond-like carbon
coatings.The use of silicon alloyed
