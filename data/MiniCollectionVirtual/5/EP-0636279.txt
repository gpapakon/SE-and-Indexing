<ABSTRACT>
Compositions and method for providing a solid conductive electrolyte composition containing a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and a salt of a conductive metal are described. The PHA is biodegradable and biocompatible and provides a basis for batteries which are more environmentally degradable. Naturally occurring polymers including polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) can be used to prepare the compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to solid
conductive electrolyte compositions incorporating a
branched poly(hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) polymer and
an ionic metal salt and to a method for producing such
compositions. In particular, the present invention
relates to the use of poly(hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) polymers in
such compositions which are polymers occurring in nature
and thus biodegradable.Polymeric electrolytes are of interest as
alternatives to liquid for use in batteries and other
applications because they do not leak, they tolerate
volume changes, and their malleability permits great
flexibility in battery design (MacCallum, J. R. and
Vincent, C. A., eds Polymer Electrolyte Reviews - 1,
Elsevier Applied Science, N.Y., pp.- 1-21 (1987); and
MacCallum, J. R. and Vincent, C. A., eds Polymer
Electrolyte Reviews -2, Elsevier Applied Science, N.Y.,
pp. 23-37 (1989)). The most widely studied materials
for this purpose have been polyethers, in particular
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(1,2-propylene oxide)
(PPO).Conductivity in ionic polymers is restricted
to the amorphous phase above the glass transition
temperature (Tg) (Gray, F. M. "Solid polymer
electrolytes" VCH, pp 1-33 (1992)), because, although
the polymer solvent is immobile in the macroscopic
sense, ionic conductance results from local motions of
the polymer segments. Polymers suitable for the
preparation of solid electrolytes should have the
following features: 1) atoms or groups of atoms 
containing electron pairs with a donor power strong
enough to coordinate a metal cation; 2) a suitable
distance between the coordinating centers to optimize
the formation of multiple intrapolymer ion bonds with
cations; and 3) low barriers to bond rotation to
facilitate segmental motion of the polymer chain. Good
mechanical properties such as malleability are also
important.In the case of polyethers, polyethylene oxide
-(C-C-O)- has an optimal backbone. Polyethers in which
the distance between oxygens in the backbone is less,
e.g. polymethylene oxide -(C-O)- or greater e.g. 1,3-polypropylene
oxide -(C-C-C-O)- do not significantly
dissolve salts. Changes in the pendant substituents
e.g. 1,2-polypropylene oxide -(C(C)-C-O)- form polymer
electrolytes with somewhat poorer conductance because of
the stearic hindrance introduced by the methyl
substituent (Cowie, J. M. G. In "Polymer electrolyte
reviews-I" (eds. J. R. MacCallum and C. A. Vincent)

(1987); and MacCallum, J. R. and C. A. Vincent In
