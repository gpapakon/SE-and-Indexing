<ABSTRACT>
A clutch control system for a vehicle having a clutch (14), a gearbox (12) having a plurality of gear ratios, an engine (10) and an engine starter circuit (50, 51, 52, 53) including a starter inhibitor (51) which is normally in a condition to allow engine starting. The control system includes a control unit (36) including aclutch engagement command signal generator for generating a command signal (Vp), a clutch actuation means (22) for controlling the state of engagement of the clutch, and an actuation control (38) responsive to the command signal (Vp) to operate the actuation means, and a starter circuit state sensor (50), for detecting activation of the starter circuit. The control unit is connected to at least one vehicle condition sensor (25, 26, 30, 32, 34) starter circuit, and on sensing said vehicle condition, switches the starter inhibitor (51) to deactivate the starter circuit. The control unit (36) is disconnectable from the starter inhibitor (51) and a driver warning device (61) is provided to indicate when said vehicle condition is detected, and/or when said control unit (36) is disconnected.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A CLUTCH CONTROL SYSTEMThe present invention relates to a clutch control system for a vehicle.The Applicant's earlier patent GB2 088 007 describes a clutch control system in which the clutch is progressively engaged as the torque demand issued by the driver increases to temporarily limit the engine speed to a set value. This provides a smooth take up from rest.The Applicant has also developed the clutch control system described in PCT application WO 92/08065 for a vehicle having a clutch, a gearbox and an engine, the system comprising a vehicle speed sensor for generating a vehicle speed variable with the speed of the vehicle, an engine speed sensor for generating an engine speed signal variable with the speed of the engine, a reference signal generator for generating a reference signal, comparator means for comparing the engine and vehicle speed signals and the reference signal, and clutch actuation means for increasing engagement of the clutch if either one of the engine or vehicle speed signals exceeds the reference siÏƒnal. 

This further development allows the vehicle clutch to engage when vehicle is running at a predetermined minimum speed, independent of engine speed, to facilitate tow starting, or prevent runaway if the vehicle begins to move down an incline.In a further development described in the Applicant's co-pending PCT application No. PCT/GB93/01896 the vehicle starter circuit is provided with a starter inhibit relay which prevents operation of the vehicle starter when the clutch control system is in certain operative modes .The present invention provides a means of operating the vehicle starter in emergency situations, wherein the clutch control system may have failed or when the clutch control system is in said certain modes in order to prevent complete immobilization of the vehicle.According to > the present invention there is provided a clutch control system for a vehicle having a clutch, a gearbox having a plurality of gear ratios, an engine, and an engine starter 

circuit including a starter inhibitor which is normally in a condition to allow engine starting, the control system comprising at least one vehicle operating condition sensor for sensing a vehicle condition and generating a vehicle condition signal in response to a detected condition, a control unit including a clutch engagement command signal generator for generating a command signal, a clutch actuation means for controlling the state of engagement of the clutch, and an actuation control responsive to the command signal

CLAIMS
1. A clutch control system for a vehicle having a clutch (14), a gearbox (12) having a plurality of gear ratios, an engine (10) and an engine starter circuit (50,51,52,53) including a starter inhibitor (51) which is normally in a condition to allow engine starting, the control system comprising at least one vehicle condition sensor (25,26,30,32,34) for sensing a vehicle operating condition and generating a vehicle condition signal in response to a detected condition, a control unit (36) including a clutch engagement command signal generator for generating a command signal (Vp), a clutch actuation means (22) for controlling the state of engagement of the clutch, and an actuation control (38) responsive to the command signal (Vp) to operate said actuation means, and a starter circuit state sensor (50) for detecting activation of the starter circuit, the control unit being connected to said sensors, and on detecting initial activation of the starter circuit, and on sensing said vehicle condition, switches the starter inhibitor (51) to deactivate the starter 


 circuit, the control system being characterised in that the control unit (36) is disconnectable from the starter inhibitor (51) and a driver warning device (61) is provided to indicate when said vehicle condition is detected, and/or when said control unit (36) is disconnected.
2. A clutch control system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the control unit (36) is disconnected from the starter inhibitor (51) through a disconnectable plug means (63) which connects the control unit to the remainder of the system.
3. A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the control unit is disconnected from the starter inhibitor (51) through a switch means located in a wiring connection from the control unit to the starter inhibitor (51) .
4. A system as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the control unit (36) is disconnectable from the starter inhibitor (51) by means of a disconnectable plug located in a wire connecting the control unit to the starter inhibitor. 


5. A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the warning device (61) is connected to the control unit (36) through a warning device relay (62) which will normally be closed so that warning device is operated when the control unit detects said vehicle condition and ceases to energise the warning device relay.
6. A system as claimed in Claim 5 wherein the warning device is a light (61).
7. A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the starter inhibitor is a starter inhibit relay (51) which is normally in a closed condition to allow engine starting.
8. A clutch control system constructed and arranged substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to and as shown in figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings.
