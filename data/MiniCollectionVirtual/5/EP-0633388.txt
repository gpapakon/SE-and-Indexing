<ABSTRACT>
A stabilizer to be mounted on a collar of a well drilling string including a 
circumferentially continuous tubular body having several outwardly extending blades thereon, 

the tubular body having an inner dimension such that it can be slid onto a drill collar, and 
radially energized components which positively fix the stabilizer on the collar including dies 

mounted in the blades, and having serrations on their inner faces, and drive elements to cause 
the serrations to bite into the collar and thereby fix the stabilizer thereon in a selected 

longitudinal and rotational position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a stabilizer apparatus for logging-while-drilling 
("LWD") or measurement-while-drilling ("MWD") applications, and particularly to a stabilizer 
including a plurality of outwardly extending blades on a tubular body that can be mounted to a 
standard drill collar and rigidly secured at a selected longitudinal and rotational position thereon. Stabilizers are used in a drill string primarily for the purpose of providing a 
predetermined radial spacing of the longitudinal axis of the drill string with respect to the 
borehole wall. A stabilizer can be either full-gauge so that the outer diameter of its blades is 
substantially the same as the gauge diameter of the bit, or somewhat under-gauge so that the 
outer diameter of its blades is less than the gauge diameter of the bit. The use of various 
combinations of full and/or under-gauge stabilizers, and the longitudinal spacing thereof along 
the drill string above the bit, is one of various methods which can be used to control the 
direction the borehole takes during drilling. In many instances it is desirable to mount a stabilizer on a "slick" drill collar, that is a 
drill collar having no special machining on its outside where the stabilizer is to be located. Such  
 
machining greatly increases the cost of the collar, reduces its versatility, and can substantially 
increase fishing and wash-over costs to the operator under circumstances mentioned below. 
Moreover, in highly deviated or horizontal wells a non-slick collar provides more drag and less 
weight-on-bit, which are other important disadvantages. In a principle aspect, the present 
invention is directed toward the provision of a stabilizer that can be slidably mounted on and 
rigidly attached to a slick drill collar in order to obviate the various disadvantages noted above. Where a stabilizer is used in association with a logging-while-drilling (LWD) or a 
measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tool, it often is desirable to locate one or more transducers 
that operate to measure a characteristic property of the earth formations which have been 
penetrated by the bit within or underneath the blades of the stabilizer. The primary purpose of 
such location is to provide a physical contact between the transducer and the earth formation. 
This causes the drilling mud to be temporarily displaced by the stabilizer blades to provide a 
measurement environment that is substantially free of borehole effects which otherwise can have 
an adverse impact on the quality of the

A stabilizer adapted to be mounted on a drill collar, comprising: a 
circumferentially continuous tubular body member having a plurality of outwardly 

extending blades; and radially energized means on said stabilizer for gripping the 
drill collar to positively prevent movement of said stabilizer relative thereto, said 

radially energized means including inner and outer members, said inner member 
having means for biting into surfaces of the drill collar to grip the same, said outer 

member and body member having rotary cam means for causing inward radial 
movement of said inner member and operation of said biting means. 
The stabilizer of claim 1 further including locking means engaging said inner and 
outer members for preventing loosening of said axial cam means. 
The stabilizer of claim 1 further including locking means engaging said outer 
member and said blade for preventing loosening of said axial cam means. 
The stabilizer of claim 2 wherein said inner member is a disc having an arcuate 
inner surface and a planar outer surface, said disc having a threaded bore engaged 

by said locking means. 
The stabilizer of claim 2 wherein said inner member is a cylindrical pin which 
seats in a companion recess in the exterior of said drill collar. 
The stabilizer of claim 1 wherein said biting means includes serrations. 
A stabilizer adapted to be slidably positioned on a drill collar and then fixedly 
mounted thereon, comprising: a circumferentially continuous tubular body 

member having a plurality of outwardly extending, circumferentially spaced 
blades; a plurality of apertures in said blades, and radially energized means in at 

least some of said apertures for gripping the drill collar and preventing movement 
 

of said stabilizer relative thereto, said radially energized means including a die 
having inner and outer faces, serrations on said inner face, and a drive member 

adapted to engage said outer face and cause said serrations to bite into the collar. 
The stabilizer of claim 7 further including a locking screw threaded to said die and 
engaging said drive member for tightening said die against said drive member. 
The stabilizer of claim 7 wherein said radially energized means includes a pin 
having inner and outer faces and serrations on said inner face, cylindrical recess 

means in said collar for receiving said pin in a manner such that said serrations bite 
into said recess means; and drive means for forcing said pin into said recess 

means. 
The stabilizer of claim 9 further including means for locking said drive means to 
said pin. 
The stabilizer of claim 10 wherein said pin has a radial length that is greater than 
the radial depth of said recess so that the full cross-sectional area thereof extends 

across the interface between said body member and said collar. 
A stabilizer adapted to be mounted on a drill collar, comprising: a 
circumferentially continuous tubular body member having a plurality of outwardly 

extending blades; and means for preventing rotation and longitudinal movement of 
said stabilizer relative to the drill collar including an aperture in one of said blades, 

recess means in the exterior of said collar radially aligned with said aperture, pin 
means engaging said aperture and said recess means, said pin means having a 

weakened section between its ends, and means for retaining said pin means in said 
aperture.
