<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for the production of extruded products from polymers which, by the addition of a hydrolysable unsaturated silane, a free-radical-forming agent and a catalyst, are cross-linked by a silanol condensation reaction in the extruder (2). Between the feed device (6) for the granular plastic and the extruder (2) is fitted a mixer (4) into which all the components of the reaction mixture are fed and mechanically mixed before being fed into the extruder (2).

A device for the manufacture of extruded products from polymers which 
are cross-linked by the addition of at least one additive in a polymerisation 

reaction, consisting of: 

a continuous casting device (2), 
a supply device (3) for the plastic granulate and a mixing device (4) arranged 
between the supply device (3) and the continuous casting device (2) with a 

supply device (5,6,7) for at least one additive, characterised in that the mixing 
device (4) has a stirring rod system (8) driven by a gear unit (21), which rod 

system (8) is formed substantially of a vertical rod (41), that the gear unit (21) 
has a vertically arranged hollow shaft (26) for the stirring rod system (8), which 

comprises a central, vertical bore, which forms the inlet (23) for the plastic 
granulate, in which the vertical rod (41) of the stirring rod system (8) is 

arranged coaxially to the inlet (23) and is connected via radial cross-pieces (37) 
with the hollow shaft (26). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the mixing device (4) 
comprises an outlet (16) for the reaction mixture. 
A device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the inlet 
(23) for plastic granulate is provided in vertical direction at the top, 

the outlet (16) for the reaction mixture is provided at the bottom on 
the mixing device (4), whereas the supplies for additives (5,6,7) are 

constructed laterally. 
A device according to Claim 3, characterised in that the additive supply 
(7) is laterally arranged in the upper region of the mixing device (4), where the 

plastic granulate enters into the mixer. 
A device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the stirring device  
 

(8) is constructed so as to be rotatable and drivable in the interior of the mixing 
device (4). 
A device according to Claim 5, characterised in that the stirring device 
(8) is formed from a vertical rod (41) arranged coaxially to the inlet (23), on 

which vertical rod (41) rods (42) are arranged distributed in radial direction 
over the circumferential region and at a distance from each other over the 

length. 
A device according to Claim 6, characterised in that the stirring rod (8) is 
drivable via the gear unit (21) about the vertical axis. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the supply (7) for 
additives is constructed as an injection nozzle. 
A device according to Claim 8, characterised in that the injection nozzle 
(7) has a valve (49) which opens or closes the injection nozzle (7) as a function 

of the pressure of the additive lying against the injection nozzle (7). 
A device according to Claim 9, characterised in that the radial 
cross-pieces (37) are connected with the vertical rod (41) via a screw connection 

(38) such that various stirring rods (8) can be screwed in according to the 
reaction mixture composition and/or throughput of the quantity of flow.
