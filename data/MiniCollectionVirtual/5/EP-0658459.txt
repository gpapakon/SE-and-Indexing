<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an impact protection device for occupants of a motor vehicle, with an airbag which is made of fabric and is composed of an upper part (1), a lower part (2) and a plurality of rebound straps arranged within the airbag. The rebound straps are formed by fabric sections (7, 8, 9, 10), which are positioned towards the interior, of reinforcement parts (3, 4, 5, 6) attached to the inside of the upper part and of the lower part, and the positioned, overlapping fabric sections are joined, in particular sewn together (connecting seams 12), approximately in a central region between the upper part and lower part by a join (11). Each rebound strap is designed such that it is at least doubled-layered continuously between the upper part and lower part of the airbag, the layers in turn being joined to one another at least in the join (11).

<CLAIMS>
A collision protection device for passengers in a motor vehicle, 
having an airbag manufactured from fabric and composed of an upper 

part (1, 1'), a lower part (2, 2') and a number of rebound straps which 
are arranged inside the airbag and run between the upper and lower parts 

of the airbag, being formed by portions (7, 7', 8, 8', 9, 9', 10, 10') 
of fabric turned down in the direction of the interior from reinforcement 

parts (3, 3', 4, 4', 5, 5', 6, 6') fitted to the inside of the upper and 
lower parts, whilst the turned-down portions of fabric overlap in about 

the middle region between the upper and lower parts and are connected, 
especially stitched (12, 12') at a junction (11, 11'),
 
characterized in that
 
on
 both the upper part (1, 1') and lower part (2, 2') two reinforcement 
parts (3, 5; 3', 5') resp. (4, 6; 4', 6') are provided, having portions 

of fabric (7, 9; 7', 9') resp. (8, 10; 8', 10') turned down in the direction 
of the interior, the portions of fabric lying opposite one another 

from every two reinforcement parts being connected, especially stitched 
together in the junction (11, 11') where they overlap one another. 
A collision protection device as in Claim 1, characterized in that 
the portions (7, 9; 8, 10) of fabric turned down in the direction of 

the interior are so arranged in the common junction (11) that every time 
one portion (7) resp. (9) of fabric turned down from the upper part (1) 

and one portion (8) resp. (10) of fabric turned down from the lower 
part (2) come to lie against one another. 
A collision protection device as in Claim 1, characterized in that 
the portions (7', 9'; 8', 10') of fabric turned down in the direction 

of the interior are so arranged in the common junction (11') that only 
one portion (7') of fabric turned down from the upper part (1') and one 

portion (10') of fabric turned down from the lower part (2') lie against 
one another.
