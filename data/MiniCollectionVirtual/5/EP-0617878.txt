<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an induction heater
wherein material is heated by contact with an inductively
heated heating element.Bulk or continuous flow heaters are employed as
driers or calciners. Typically, a heating member contacts
material to be heated so that heat is efficiently
transferred from the heating element to the material to be
heated. Some degree of mixing action to improve contact
can also be incorporated with the heating action of the
heating element. This can for example be provided by the
heating element with fin members. As a result, contact
between the heating element and the material to be heated
is enhanced. However, it is preferable to provide
substantial uniform heating of the material to be heated.
consequently means are required to supply heat uniformly to
the heating member and the fin members thereof.The supply of heat to the heating element is
particularly problematical where fin members are included.
Known driers incorporate heating by means of gas jets or
hot fluid. Consequently, in order to heat such fin members
complicated supply tubing must be engineered into the fin
member. It is also known to adapt the fin member to
enhance the mixing resulting from movement of the heating
element. This only serves to further complicate the design
of the fin member. Particular problems are encountered
with rotary drum driers and calciners since it is necessary
to incoporate rotary couplings for supply of the hot fluid
or gases. Consequently, there are a number of drawbacks
for heating the heating element of known bulk continuous
flow heaters. GB 2163930 discloses an induction heater having an
alternating current carrying conductor extending along an
axis. A core means substantially encircles the axis to
guide magnetic flux resulting from an alternating current
in the conductor. The heating element is an electrically
heating closed loop which encircles the magnetic flux in
the core means and so is heated by electrical current
induced therein.Two of the embodiments disclosed in GB 2163930 are
shown in Figures 1 and 2. In the embodiment of Figure 1,
the conductor 1 forms an axis about which is provided a
ferromagnetic core 4. The core 4 is enclosed within a
metal skin formed from concentrically aligned inner
cylinder 5 and outer cylinder 7 and end plates 6 and 9. In
this way, the skin forms a closed electrically conducting
loop about the core 4. Alternating current set up in the
conductor 1 by a toroidally wound transformer 8 set up an
alternating magnetic flux which is guided by the core
