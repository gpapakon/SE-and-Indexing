<ABSTRACT>
The piezoelectric resonator is provided with a piezoelectric substrate (100)
of a quartz plate, electrodes (101, 102) mounted on the front and rear sides of the

piezoelectric substrate (100), quartz protective substrates (105, 106) disposed to be
superposed on the front and rear sides of the piezoelectric substrate (100), having

the same material and the same cut angle as the piezoelectric substrate (100), and
junctions (107, 108, 109, 110) containing gold and silver, which connect the

piezoelectric substrate (100) and the protective substrates (105, 106) by means of
the diffused junction or the cold junction. With this construction, the piezoelectric

substrate (100) is sealed by the junctions (107 - 110). The junctions (107 - 110) are
formed by means of the diffused junction or the cold junction, so that the electric

resistance thereof is maintained low.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technique of manufacturing a
piezoelectric resonator, in which the piezoelectric resonator and the package
thereof are apparently integrated into a unit, so that the package is needless to
handle.Accompanied with the recent trend for a larger capacity and a higher
frequency in the mobile telephone field, various types of filters including a
piezoelectric resonator being an electromechanical functional component using a
piezoelectric material and a SAW (Surface Acoustic Wave) filter have been
required to fit in with the trend for a still further miniaturization and thinness,
and for a higher frequency. In most cases, the piezoelectric resonator or the
piezoelectric filter utilizing the bulk wave is used for the range 10 MHz ∼ 100
MHz, and the SAW filter utilizing the Surface Acoustic wave is used for the range
100 MHz ∼ 1 GHz.The crystal as a piezoelectric material has the most excellent characteristics
of the piezoelectric materials in that it has a very high Q-factor and a high
frequency stability against temperature; and various piezoelectric products using
the crystal are materialized as a crystal resonator or a monolithic crystal filter.Now, in these piezoelectric products, thin film electrodes are formed on both
the front and rear sides of a piezoelectric plate such as a crystal. And, a RF voltage
is applied to the piezoelectric resonator to resonate it utilizing the piezoelectric
effect. Accordingly, the piezoelectric resonator is housed in a ceramic package and 
the like. In this case, the thin film electrodes are to be protected from a bad
influence by an external environmental change. The ceramic package is provided
with a seal ring for a hermetic sealing, and after the crystal resonator is mounted
inside the ceramic package, a metal cap is covered on the seal ring, which is
hermetically sealed by means of the seam welding, thus maintaining a high
reliability. A conductive adhesive connects formed leader electrodes with
electrode terminals formed inside the ceramic package that apply a RF voltage to
the leader electrodes. The conductive adhesive has conductivity, whereby the
supply RF voltage terminal is electrically connected to the leader electrodes.However, the resistance of a silver filler contained in the conductive
adhesive can increase due to the aging characteristic and the like. Accordingly,
the effective RF voltage will decrease which is applied to the piezoelectric
resonator from the power supply of a constant RF voltage. Thus, the drive RF
voltage
