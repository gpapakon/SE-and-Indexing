<ABSTRACT>
A method for casting plastic lenses is disclosed in which lens 
forming materials including at least one liquid monomer and at 

least one photosensitive initiator are injected into a mold (8,48). The 
lens forming materials in the mold are subjected to ultraviolet 

light. The mold assembly is cooled in a liquid cooling bath (38). The 
temperature of the lens forming material within the mold is 

monitored, and the ultraviolet light is turned off when the 
temperature reaches a predetermined upper set point temperature. 

The ultraviolet light is turned on again when the temperature falls 
to a predetermined lower set point temperature. The process can be 

performed automatically with a programmable process control, which 
monitors the temperature, compares the temperature to the 

predetermined set point temperature, and turns the ultraviolet 
light on and off according to the results of the comparison.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to processes for casting
optical lenses, and more particularly to processes for casting
plastic optical lenses.Plastic lenses are desirable because they are lighter in
weight, higher in impact resistance, and lower in manufacturing
cost than comparable inorganic glass lenses. The most common
monomer utilized to produce optical plastic lenses is diethylene
glycol diallyl carbonate (hereinafter referred to as DAC), which is
marketed by AKZO Chemicals Inc. of Dobbs Ferry, New York and PPG
Industries, Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania under the trademarks
Nouryset 200® and CR-39®, respectively. DAC is widely accepted due
to the clarity, strength, impact resistance, resistance to
discolorization, and resistance to physical warping or distortion
of products made from DAC.According to current manufacturing processes, the DAC monomer
is mixed with free-radical initiator, such as di-isopropyl peroxy
dicarbonate. These lens forming materials are injected within a
pair of glass mold sections that are sealed by a gasket and held
together by a spring clip or other suitable fastener. The charged
mold assembly is then heated in a water bath or air oven to a
predetermined temperature to cure the resin.The above described thermal curing process has several
drawbacks. As an initial matter, the peroxide catalysts require 
extreme care in handling. Also, the plastic lenses made from DAC
have a refractive index (nD) of about 1.50, which is lower than the
refractive index of conventional inorganic glass lenses, the latter
being about 1.523. The center thickness and edge thickness of the
lenses must, therefore, be made larger than the thickness of
inorganic glass lenses.Efforts have been made to develop compositions which are
capable of producing higher refractive index lenses than those
currently produced by the polymerization of DAC. Such compounds
were found to increase the value of the refractive index, but also
required very long curing times, usually 1 to 4 days in length.
Also, the resulting lenses typically lack one or more desirable
physical properties, such as impact strength, scratch resistance,
heat resistance, and colorless transparency.Conventional thermo-casting techniques require very long
curing times, at least about 10 to 20 hours to cast finished (thin)
lenses, and about 20 to 60 hours to produce optically acceptable
semi-finished (thick) lenses. This low lens productivity requires
a large inventory of the expensive glass molds that are used to
cast the lenses. There is,
