<ABSTRACT>
For producing packaging means, in particular in the form of flat soft plates which contain a filling obtained from corrugated board waste, wood wool or paper wool or the like which has been reduced in size, in a closed paper sleeve, paper is mixed with a corrugated board waste, preferably in the ratio 1:2, the paper having been reduced in size by at least one cutting process into relatively narrow strips of, for example, 1.5 cm to 4.5 cm in length and corrugated, whereupon the mixture is metered into the paper sleeve, previously coated on one side with polyethylene, and the said paper sleeve is closed by means of heat-sealing. The paper covering consists of kraft paper glazed on one side with a thickness of at least 40 g/m

 which, if necessary, has previously been printed. The paper waste can be reduced in size in successive cutting processes to shreds of approximately the same size as separately fed corrugated board shreds, the paper and corrugated board shreds obtained being mixed in an adjustable ratio, metered into or brought onto a conveying path, preformed to make elastically supple shred bodies and subsequently enclosed in a wipeable paper sleeve.
