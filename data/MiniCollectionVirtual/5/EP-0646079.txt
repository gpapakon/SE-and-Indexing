<ABSTRACT>
A fluid control system for use with a tractor trailer brake system comprises a branch conduit (19, 25) which is to be connected to a pressure supply line (20) and a control line (22) to enable priming of the control line (20) so that signals generated upon application of the vehicle brake pedal are more quickly transmitted to the trailer brakes to overcome problems associated with delay in application of the trailer brakes. An electrically operated solenoid valve (11) is provided for controlling fluid flow through the branch conduit so that upon application of the vehicle brake pedal the solenoid valve is operated to open the branch conduit to allow pressurised fluid to flow from the supply line (20) to the control line (22) for a predetermined time period to prime the control line (22). Pressurised fluid from the branch supply conduit is directed longitudinally down the control line (22) by a longitudinally arranged outlet (35) so that substantially all of the fluid is directed to backfill the control line. The system may be embodied in a block arrangement in which bores are drilled in a block housing and in which the branch conduit (19, 25) is formed by passages drilled in the block or may be formed from discrete hose sections and couplings.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUIDCONTROLSYSTEMFORTRACTORTRAILERBRAKESYSTEMThis invention relates to improvements in control systems utilising working fluids, and in particular to pneumatic o hydraulic braking systems such as may be found on vehicles and in particular on semi trailers, trucks and the like.Australian patent application number 41104/89 discloses brake systems for prime movers and trailers and discuss problems associated with compressed air brake system desig and, in particular, premature brake lining wear in a prime mover which results when predominantly gentle braking take place. The earlier applications propose a system in which compressed air is fed into a brake control line which controls application of the trailer brakes in order to"prime" the trailer brakes system so that there is minimal delay in brake application after the brake pedal is depressed by a driver. The brake control line carries a signal from the foot pedal of the prime mover to a relay valve to activate the relay valve so pressurised fluid can flow from a reservoir which is supplied by a supply line t eventually activate Îµ brake. The invention disclosed in the earlier applications has been found to significantly overcome problems associated with delay in application of th. trailer brakes during gentle braking and therefore braking load is more evenly distributed between the brakes of the prime mover and the trailer thereby decreasing brak lining wear on the prime mover and also providing smoother and enhanced braking characteristics .Since brake lining wear is associated with the prime* move rather than the trailer, and since prime movers and trailers are often owned by different organisations, it is of more concern to the owner of the prime mover to enhanc 

braking characteristics of the trailer. The systems described in the above Australian patent application propose the injection of pressurised air in the control line at or near the relay valve associated with the traile brakes. It would be advantageous to allow for injection into the brake control line at the location of the prime mover so that the pneumatic or hydraulic circuitry can be associated with the prime mover rather than the trailer an without the need for additional connection of pneumatic or hydraulic lines and electric cables above that which is normally required when connecting a trailer to a prime mover. Incorporation of the reg-uired hydraulic or pneumatic lines in the prime mover which would provide for the above mentioned priming of the trailer brake system would enable
