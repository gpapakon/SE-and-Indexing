<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a condensed cyclic
compound or a salt thereof, and, to a squalene
synthetase inhibitor comprising same as the effective
component.Hypercholesteremia, high blood pressure and
smoking are known as three major dangerous factors of
causing ischemic heart diseases. Adequate control of
cholesterol concentration in blood is remarkably
important for the prophylaxis or therapy of, besides
these ischemic heart diseases, as well as of coronary
sclerosis.As pharmaceutical compositions for lowering
cholesterol in blood, attention has been drawn to those
for controlling the biosynthesis of cholesterol,
besides those of inhibiting its absorption by binding
bile acid including, among others, cholestyramine,
colestipol (disclosed in, for example, USP 4027009),
and those of suppressing the intestinal absorption of
cholesterol by inhibiting acyl coenzyme A cholesterol
acyl transferase (ACAT) including melinamide (disclosed
in French Patent No.1476569). As pharmaceutical
preparations for controlling the biosynthesis of
cholesterol, lovastatin (disclosed in USP 4231938),
simvastatin (disclosed in USP 4444784), pravastatin
(USP 4346227), etc., which are capable of inhibiting
especially 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA)
reductase, are provided for medicinal use.
However, when HMG-CoA reductase is inhibited, not only
the biosynthesis of cholesterol but the biosynthesis of
some other components such ubiquinone, dolichol and
heme A, which are necessary for the living body, is
also inhibited, so that occurrences of undesirable side 
effects to be caused thereby are feared.Squalene synthetase is an enzyme taking part in
the essential step of new cholesterol biosynthetic
route. And, this enzyme is an enzyme forming squalene
catalyzing the reductive dimerization of two molecules
of farnesyl pyrophosphoric acid.On the other hand, the compounds expected as
inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting
squalene synthetase are disclosed in Journal of
Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 51, No. 10, pp.1869-1871,
1988, Japanese published unexamined patent application
