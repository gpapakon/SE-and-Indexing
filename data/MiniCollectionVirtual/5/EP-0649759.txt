<ABSTRACT>
A sharpener (1) for pencils, chalk and the like contains a sharpener body (2) with at least one receiving space (3, 3') which is of a circular cross-section and extends in a conically tapering manner from an introduction opening into the sharpener body (2), and with a discharge opening (5) which extends through the sharpener body (2) for the discharge of sharpenings from the receiving space (3, 3'). Provision is made for a sharpener blade (6) which partially covers over the discharge opening (5) and of which the cutting edge (7) runs parallel to a surface line of the outer surface of the receiving space (3, 3') and intersects the outer surface along a surface line in the discharge opening (5). The sharpener body (2) is made of compressed metal shavings or emptied, compressed metal cans or parts thereof. Consequently, the exterior (9) of the sharpener body (2) exhibits, in particular, folding cavities (10).
