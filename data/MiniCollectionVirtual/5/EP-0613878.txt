<ABSTRACT>
In the production of citric acid aqueous mother 
liquor originating from a lime/sulfuric acid process is 

subjected to a multi-stage counter-current extraction with 
an amine based organic extractant. A solution of a further 

amount of citric acid derived from direct extraction of a 
citric acid fermentation broth is judiciously injected into 

the organic phase stream in the counter-current extraction 
and a combined extract is withdrawn from the operation. 

This extract can be subjected to any known treatment for 
the recovery of citric acid values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of citric acid production 
and is directed to an improvement in the process of solvent extraction of 
citric acid from an aqueous solution by means of a water-immiscible 
organic extractant in a multi-stage counter-current extraction operation. Citric acid is produced commercially by fermentation of 
carbohydrates. By one known method, essentially clean carbohydrates such 
as glucose or refined sucrose are used for the fermentation and this yields 
a relatively clean fermentation broth from which citric acid can be recovered 
by direct extraction with a water-immiscible organic extractant followed by 
water stripping of the resulting extract as described, for example, in 
US 3,944,606, US 4,275,234 and US 4,334,095. According to US 
3,944,606 alkali metal or ammonium citrates are produced directly from a 
fermentation broth by extraction with a water-immiscible organic extractant  
 
consisting of a mixture of a secondary or tertiary amine with an organic 
solvent, and the resulting organic extract is re-extracted with a compound 
that forms an alkali metal or ammonium salt of citric acid. According to US 4,275,234 a citric acid fermentation broth is 
extracted with a water-immiscible organic extractant which comprises a 
solution of at least one secondary or tertiary amine in which the aggregate 
number of carbon atoms is at least 20 in admixture with hydrocarbon and 
alcohol and the resulting extract is stripped with water at a temperature 
which is higher, preferably by at least 20Â°C than the broth extraction 
temperature. According to US 4,334,095 a citric acid fermentation broth is 
extracted with a mixture of a water-immiscible amine and a water-immiscible 
organic acid dissolved in a suitable water-immiscible solvent, 
and the resulting extract is back-extracted with water. The most common source of carbohydrate for citric acid 
fermentation is beet molasses. Citric acid fermentation on such a nutrient 
yields a fermentation broth rich in cations and the yield of direct extraction 
thereof is poor. Accordingly, the recovery of citric acid from such broth is 
usually by way of the so-called "lime/sulfuric acid process". This process 
comprises a so-called "liming" operation, i.e. treatment of the fermentation 
broth with calcium hydroxide to yield calcium citrate which is filtered off, 
washed and decomposed with aqueous sulfuric acid. The calcium sulfate 
that forms is filtered off and the resulting aqueous acidic solution is 
gradually evaporated in a

A process for the manufacture of citric acid 
comprising extraction of an aqueous citric acid feed solution 

derived from a first source of citric acid with a water-immiscible 
amine based extractant that includes at least one 

organic amine and at least one liquid hydrocarbon, in which 
process aqueous and organic phases are contacted counter-currently 

in a multi-stage extraction operation to produce a 
first stream of organic citric acid extract, characterised in

(i) there is injection into the organic phase of a 
second stream of an organic citric acid extract in 

the same amine based extractant and derived from a 
second source of citric acid; 
(ii) the said aqueous citric acid feed solution contains 
at least 40% w/w citric acid; 
(iii) the concentration of the citric acid in the said 
second stream of organic citric acid extract is 

less than 1 mol. citric acid per mol. of amine; 
(iv) the said second 
stream of organic citric acid extract is 

injected into the said first stream of organic 
citric acid extract at an intermediary operational 

phase of the multi-stage extraction operation at 
which the citric acid concentration in both 

extracts is essentially the same; and 
(v) a product extract is withdrawn from said multi-extraction

aqueous citric acid feed solution is a lime sulfuric acid 

citric acid mother liquor derived from a citric acid 
fermentation broth by a sequence of operations comprising 

treating said fermentation broth with calcium hydroxide, 
separating the so-formed calcium citrate, decomposing the 

separated calcium citrate with aqueous sulfuric acid to

A process according to claim 7, wherein said 
alkanol is octanol.
