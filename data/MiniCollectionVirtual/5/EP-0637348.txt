<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for treating fiber suspension. The apparatus in accordance with the present invention is especially suitable for screening pulps and also for thickening. More accurately, the apparatus relates to the pulse member construction of the screen or thickener being used. It is characteristic of all pulse members in accordance with the prior art that when the capacity of the screening apparatus is increased, for example, by using greater pressure differences or the cleanliness of the accept is increased by decreasing the size of the perforations or slots, this results in a situation, in which the screen cylinder tends to clog. The problem is thus keeping the screen cylinder clean, which is a precondition for optimizing other features in the screening. The present invention relates to a pulse member (P) of the screening apparatus, which is characterized in that the screen surface is subjected thereby with members (60) to a pulse cleaning the screen surface without a chance to allow the pressure effect "escape" past the area being cleaned. It is also typical of the pulse member in accordance with the present invention that the higher the consistency of the fiber matting is or the worse the screen surface is clogged, the stronger the pulse cleaning the screen surface is.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for treating
fiber suspension. Said apparatus is especially applicable
for screening and also thickening pulp in the wood processing
industry. More precisely the inventive concept of the
apparatus of the invention is related to the pulse member
construction of the screen or thickener being used.There are in principle two known pulse member types, which
both are generally used and the purpose of which is, as
known, to maintain the screen surface clear, in other words,
to prevent the formation of a fiber matting on the screen
surface. One type is exemplified, for example, by a rotor
embodiment in accordance with US Patent 4,193,865, in which
a rotor is rotatably mounted within a stationary screen
cylinder, comprising blades located close to the surface of
the screen cylinder. Said blades form an angle with the axis
of the cylinder in the embodiment of said patent. The screen
surface is subjected to pressure pulses by the moving blades
clearing the openings of the screen surface. There are
embodiments that have blades on both sides of the screen
cylinder. Consequently, the suspension being treated is fed
either to the inside or to the outside of the cylinder and
the accept is discharged from the outside or from the inside
of the cylinder, respectively.In a European Patent Application EP-A-0 436 888 there is
disclosed a pressure screen apparatus having a foil-type
rotor. The foils of the rotor are fastened either on the
shaft of the rotor or on a cylindrical rotor surface. The
foils have a leading surface, a surface substantially
parallel to the screen cylinder and a sloping trailing
surface. The leading surface is provided with grooves in
circumferential direction. The grooves are formed of side
surfaces and a bottom surface. The bottom surface forms an
acute angle with the screen cylinder whereby the 
crossectional area between the groove and the screen
cylinder reduces towards the trailing surface of the foil.
Thus the bottom surface creates a zone of increased pressure
forcing fiber suspension through the screen cylinder
openings. In a corresponding manner, the sloping trailing
surface creates a zone of reduced pressure at the back side
of the foil whereby the screen cylinder openings are
backflushed.Another type worth mentioning is, for example, one in
accordance with US Patent 3,437,204, in which the rotor is a
substantially cylindrical closed body, the surface of which
is provided with almost hemispherical protrusions, so called
bulges. In said apparatus
