and a part-cylindrical print area (32) facing towards the outside of the 
cylinder which has a housing (33) delimited in part by two first walls (34, 35) 

extending radially from the print area and a second wall (36) extending 
parallel to the base and spaced therefrom by the first walls, said housing 

opening towards the print area and towards the base of the cylinder, three 
spindles (37, 38, 39) extending axially from the second wall towards the 

base of the cylinder being adapted to be inserted axially into the bushes of 
the block cassette according to claim 3.
