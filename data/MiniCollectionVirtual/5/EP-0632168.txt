<ABSTRACT>
A transmission for a heavy construction equipment such as a wheel 
type excavator adopting a hydrostatic main drive system and 

having an upper turning body, a lower travelling body and a 
turning joint (12) for coupling the upper turning body to the 

lower travelling body. The transmission comprising a gear box 
disposed in the lower travelling body and provided with clutches 

(22,23) for at least two speed change stages, a control unit (5) 
and a charging pump (13) disposed in the upper turning body, a 

power shift motor (14) adapted to be actuated by oil fed from the 
charging pump (13) and a power shift pump (15) adapted to be 

actuated by the power shift motor (14) disposed in the lower 
travelling body and feeding oil to the clutches (22,23) to 

perform speed changes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transmission for a 
heavy construction equipment, and more particularly to a 
transmission for a heavy construction equipment such as a 
wheel type excavator adopting the hydrostatic drive system as 
means for transmitting travelling power. A typical transmission for a heavy construction equipment 
such as a wheel type excavator is illustrated in FIG. 1. As 
shown in the drawing, the transmission includes a gear box 111 
disposed in a lower travelling body of the heavy construction 
equipment and a controller 105 disposed in an upper turning 
body of the heavy construction equipment. The upper turning 
body is coupled to the lower travelling body by means of a 
turning joint 112 so that it can turn through a desired angle 
with respect to the lower travelling body. The controller 105 includes a pilot pump 101 adapted to 
supply oil for a gear shifting for a speed change and a 
lubrication, a pressure control valve 102 communicated with 
the pilot pump 101 and adapted to control pressure of the oil,  
 
and a solenoid value 104 communicated with the pressure 
control valve 102 and adapted to switch oil path communication 
between the pilot pump 101 and the gear box 111 in accordance 
with an electrically switching manipulation of a gear shifting 
lever 103. The gear box 111 includes a pair of different-stage 
cylinders 106 and 107 actuated by the oil path communication 
obtained by the solenoid valve 104, a gear shifting valve 108 
provided with oil paths respectively communicated with the 
cylinders 106 and 107 and adapted to perform a switching 
operation for selectively opening and closing the oil paths, 
and a pair of different-stage clutches 109 and 110 both 
communicated with the gear shifting valve 108 and actuated by 
the oil path communication switching operation of the gear 
shifting valve 108. Although not shown, the turning joint 112 has various oil 
paths respectively adapted to supply oil pressure from a 
hydraulic pump equipped in the lower travelling body to 
various working units such as a boom of the upper turning body 
or a dipper stick. Since various oil paths pass through the turning joint 
112 as a moving part in the above-mentioned conventional 
transmission, damage of the turning joint 112 which occurs 
relatively frequently results in oil leakage from oil paths 
and thereby loss of pressurized oil.  In the conventional transmission, the oil paths extending 
from the hydraulic pump equipped in the gear box 111 as an oil 
pressure supply source
