<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of water-softening compositions which contain     (a) biodegradable copolymers,   (b) inorganic water-softening silicates and, where appropriate,   (c) further inorganic salts,   (d) dispersants and complexing agents and   (e) surfactants  as well as other customary additives. These compositions are distinguished by better biodegradability.

<CLAIMS>
Water-softening compositions, containing

(a) from 5 to 80 wt.-% of biodegradable copolymers
which have a degradability of â‰¥60% and may be obtained

by free-radical polymerization of

A. monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids
and/or salts thereof,
B. monoethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic
acids and/or salts thereof,
C. mono-unsaturated monomers which, following polymerization
and hydrolysis or saponification,

yield monomer units having one or more hydroxyl
groups on the carbon chain, and
D. from 0 to 15 wt.-% of other free-radical-copolymerizable
monomers,

in an aqueous medium, and subsequent hydrolysis or
saponification of the polymerized monomer units according

to C.,
(b) from 10 to 95 wt.-% of water-softening inorganic
silicates,
(c) from 0 to 80 wt.-% of other inorganic salts,
(d) from 0 to 70 wt.-% of dispersing and complexing
agents, and
(e) from 0 to 5 wt.-% of surfactants,

relative to the anhydrous substance.
The compositions of claim 1, characterized in
that component (a) is contained at a level of from 5 to

30 wt.-%.
The compositions of claim 2, characterized in
that component (b) is contained at a level of from 30 to

80 wt.-%. 
The compositions of claim 1, characterized in
that component (d) is contained at a level of from 2 to

40 wt.-%.
Use of the compositions according to claim 1 as
water softeners.
