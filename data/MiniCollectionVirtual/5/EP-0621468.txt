products having circular or oval footprint configurations. 

A conveyor having a pair of parallel conveyor 
elements arranged to underengage the footprint only adjacent 

the periphery thereof transports the products one at 
a time across a planar surface of a weigh pan or scale 

device. The surface of the weigh pan is shaped and the 
transverse spacing between the conveyor elements is adjustable 

in order to permit lengths of the surface of the weigh 
pan engaged by the conveyor elements to be selected to 

correspond essentially to dimensions of differently sized 
products to be weighed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to high speed weighing
equipment of the type employing a conveyor to transport
containers one at a time across a vertically deflectable
weigh pan or scale device operable to effect weighing of
the products. More particularly, the invention relates to
improvements in weighing equipment of the type intended for
use in the weighing of containers having either circular or
oval footprint configurations and employing conveyors
characterized as having a pair of parallel conveying
elements, such as endless chains, arranged to underengage
the footprints of the containers as they transport the
containers for movement across a weigh pan.In EP-A-0 587 376
there is disclosed
a method and apparatus for weighing products of either
circular or oval footprint configuration, wherein the
products are supported by conveyor chains arranged to
underengage the footprints only immediately adjacent the
periphery thereof in order to minimize the effective length
of products, as seen by the weigh pan. In a preferred
embodiment, the length of the weigh pan in the direction of
product movement is chosen to correspond essentially to a
dimension of the product to be weighed, as measured in the
direction of conveyor movement.Once a given checkweigher has been fitted with a weigh
pan of a given length to effect weighing of product of a
given dimension, the checkweigher may not thereafter be
used efficiently in the weighing of products having substantially
different dimensions, without first affecting a
substantial reconstruction of the checkweigher, including
the mounting of a new appropriately sized weigh pan.The present invention relates to checkweighers, and
more particularly to improvements in checkweighers of the 
type disclosed in EP-A-0 587 376, which forms part of the state of
the art under Article 54(3)EPC.GB-A-2 160 985 discloses a checkweigher having a rotating scroll feed and a multiplicity of conveyors one of which is used for transporting articles to be weighed over a weigh cell, wherein the scroll transfers the articles directly to the weigh cell conveyor.The present invention
permits selective weighing
of products, chosen from a series of groups of differently
sized products.This is achieved by a checkweigher according to Claim 1 and by a weighing method according to Claim 18 . The precharacterising part of Claim is based on GB-A- 2 160 985.The present invention provides
a weigh pan whose effective length for
product weighing purposes varies in a direction extending
transversely of the
