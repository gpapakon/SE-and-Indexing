<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous liquid composition containing polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight in the range of about 200 to about 8000, nonionic surfactant, and a corrosion inhibitor, and optionally, amphoteric surfactants and fluorinated surfactants is useful as a highlighting liquid for detection of surface irregularities on shaped metal surfaces and for preventing adhesion of weld splatter on surfaces coated with the composition. Preferably the corrosion inhibitor includes alkali metal salts of boric acid and of a mixture of branched chain carboxylic acids and amino acids.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aqueous composition that is substantially free from
volatile organic compounds ("VOC") and is useful for at least one, and in some embodiments
for both, of two purposes in connection with industrial metal working, particularly
in the automotive industry: providing a glossy surface to facilitate the visual
detection of small scale surface shape irregularities, commonly called "dents" and
"dings", in shaped metal surfaces that are intended eventually to have a glossy finish,
but have not yet reached that stage of their processing, and inhibiting the adhesion of
small amounts of hot metal, commonly called "weld splatter", on nearby surfaces during
welding of metal objects.During industrial manufacturing of many types of metal goods, it is common
practice to weld together two or more separate pieces of metal to form a unitary structure.
Normally, welding is confined to a relatively narrow zone of the total structure
formed by welding, but it produces small and very hot, often molten, bits of metal that
are discharged into the space surrounding the welding zone and often come into contact 
with and, unless inhibited from doing so, stick to, nearby areas of the structure
being formed by welding. Any such weld splatter adhering to the structure being
formed by welding becomes a surface defect, and, if the surface of the structure being
welded is intended eventually to become a glossy finished surface, such as an automobile
body, file cabinet, or the like, any such defects must be prevented or repaired in
order to achieve a satisfactory finish. Repairing defects of this type is relatively expensive,
so that prevention is highly preferred.The adhesion of welding splatter can be inhibited by covering surfaces in the
vicinity of welds with an inhibiting composition. Compositions now in commercial
use for this purpose are believed to consist primarily of water, alkali neutralized complex
acrylic acids, high foaming nonionic surfactants, and defoamers. These materials
are often not fully satisfactory for at least two reasons: They have sufficiently high
viscosity to develop noticeable thickness variations ("sagging") on non-horizontal surfaces,
and they offer insufficient protection against corrosion when surfaces coated
with them are stored for more than a day or two.During the manufacture of automobiles and other metal goods with decorative
glossy surfaces, it is common practice to inspect Class A surfaces for metal surface
shape irregularities (dents or dings) prior to painting the
