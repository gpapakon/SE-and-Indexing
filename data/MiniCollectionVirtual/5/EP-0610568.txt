<ABSTRACT>
A rotary tank (1) supported by a bearing stand (2) on a 
horizontal shaft (6) in a freely rotatable manner to form a 

grinding/mixing chamber (4) having an inner wall (3) of modified 
cross-section such as oval one at the horizontal center 

axis position is driven by a rotary drive motor (13) for driving 
said rotary tank (1) to rotate it adjustably at any relatively 

low speed in a certain direction. A grinding/mixing blade (10) 
is inserted into said grinding/mixing chamber (4)  over its 

whole length and mounted at the coaxial position on the 
rotary shaft (11) other than that for the rotary tank. The 

grinding/mixing blade (10) has a cross-section in which its long 
diameter portion is shorter than the short diameter portion 

of said grinding/mixing chamber (4), and is driven by a rotary 
drive motor (16) for driving said grinding/mixing blade (10) to 

rotate it adjustably at any speed in normal or reverse 
direction to grind and mix the bulk materials charged into 

said grinding/mixing chamber (4) by relative rotating motions 
of rotary tank (2) and grinding/mixing blade (10) and also to 

perform coating, granulation and dispersion by these 
actions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a grinding and
mixing device capable of peforming regular mixing upon
mixing of several kinds of fine particles.For grinding, mixing, coating or dispersion of bulk
materials (powder and particles), the grinding and mixing
device as shown, for example, in Fig. 6 has been
conventionally used. Namely, the conventional device
comprises grinding tank 50 rotating at a high speed in the
direction of arrow A, crescent-shaped inner piece 51 held
so as to make a small gap G with the inner wall of said
grinding tank 50 and driven to rotate with some delay in
the same direction (arrow B) as said grinding tank 50, and
grinding/ mixing chamber 52 in which bulk materials a are
received for processing.The bulk materials a charged into grinding/mixing
chamber 52 are pushed, under the influence of strong
centrifugal force, against the inner wall of
grinding/mixing chamber 52 because grinding tank 50 is
rotating at a high speed in the direction of arrow B. The
bulk materials a pushed against the inner wall are pushed 
by inner piece 51 into small gap G and are then compressed
further and subjected to strong shearing force, thus
leading to the formation of fine powders from the particle
surface.According to the grinding and mixing device of said
structure, however, the materials become sticking like a
lining to the inner wall of grinding/mixing chamber 52 and
cause almost no fluidization in the thickness direction
because grinding tank 50 is rotating at a high speed. For
this reason, though fine powders are formed by shearing and
friction on the surface where inner piece 51 slides, almost
no powder is formed in the vicinity of the inner wall of
grinding/mixing chamber 52, thus requiring it much time to
achieve complete uniformity of products as a whole.Furthermore, the conventional device of said
structure has the disadvantage that since inner piece 51 is
always in sliding contact with the bulk materials a under
strong pressure, said inner piece 51 becomes higher in
temperature due to friction, which causes thermal
deterioration of bulk materials. US-A-4,059,232 and EP-A-0 514 562 are disclosing a grinding
and mixing device having a rotatable agitator in a non
rotatable vessel. The present invention has been made with a view to
solving the foregoing problems, and the object of this
invention is to provide a grinding and mixing device
capable of grinding and mixing bulk materials in a short
time with no thermal influence exerted on the bulk
materials and achieving not only mere mixing, but
