<ABSTRACT>
In a multi-car train having a train-wide communications network for communication between a master vehicle processing system on a master car and slave vehicle processing systems on slave cars in the train, each car having a vehicle communications network connected to subsystems of the car, an arrangement for collecting real-time data pertaining to operation of the subsystems. The master  vehicle processing system of the master car forms and transmits a subsystem variable request message to slave vehicle processing systems in one or more slave cars in the train over the trainwide communications network requesting data on the operation of at least one subsystem. The slave vehicle processing systems of the one or more slave cars in the train respond to the subsystem variable request message by forming and transmitting a subsystem variable response message containing the requested data on the operation of the at least one subsystem. A display device is operatively connected to the master vehicle processing system of the master car for displaying the requested subsystem operating variable status data.

WE CLAIM :
1. In a multi-car train having a train-wide com¬ munications network for communication between a master vehicle processing system on a master car and. slave vehicle processing systems on slave cars in the train, each car having a vehicle communications network connected to subsystems of the car, an arrangement for collecting real-time data pertaining to operation of the subsystems comprising: requesting means in the master vehicle processing system of the master car for forming and transmitting a subsystem variable request message to slave vehicle processing systems in one or more slave cars in the train over the trainwide communications network requesting data on the operation of at least one subsystem; responding means in the slave vehicle processing systems of the one or more slave cars in the train for responding to the subsystem variable request message by forming and transmitting a subsystem variable response message containing the requested data on the operation of the at least one subsystem; and displaying means operatively connected to the master vehicle processing system of the master car for displaying the requested subsystem operating variable status data.
2. The arrangement according to claim 1, wherein the request and response messages are formed as data packets.
3. The arrangement according to claim 1, wherein the display means comprises a strip chart recorder.
4. The arrangement according to claim 1, wherein each responding means comprises: 


 monitoring means for monitoring subsystems operation; and logging means for storing operating variable data associated with subsystems operation and for periodically updating the operating variable data associated with subsystems operation.
5. The arrangement according to claim 1, wherein the requesting means comprises: menuing means for selectively presenting to an operator one of a plurality of tables, each table showing a menu of subsystem operating variables which can be displayed for a respective subsystem; and selecting means for selecting at least one particular subsystem and at .least one particular operating variable to be displayed; wherein the requesting means forms a subsystem variable request message based on the at least one subsystem and at least one operating variable presented on the menuing means and selected with the selecting means.
6. The arrangement according to claim 1, wherein the displaying means comprises extracting means for extracting the operating variable status data from the subsystem variable response message and converting means for converting the extracted data into a displayable form.
7. 
•
The arrangement according to claim 6, wherein the converting means comprises a digital to analog convertor and the displaying means comprises a strip chart recorder.
8. In a multi-car train having a train-wide com¬ munications network for communication between a master vehicle processing system on a master car and slave 


vehicle processing systems on slave cars in the train, each car having a vehicle communications network connected to subsystems of the car, a method for collecting real-time data pertaining to operation of the subsystems comprising: requesting data on the operation of at least one subsystem, including forming and transmitting a subsystem variable request message to slave vehicle processing systems in one or moire slave cars in the train over the trainwide communications network; responding to the subsystem variable request message with the requested data on the operation of the at least one subsystem, including forming and transmitt¬ ing a subsystem variable response message; and displaying the requested subsystem operating variable status data.

tern operating variables which can be displayed for a respective subsystem; and selecting at least one particular subsystem and at least one particular operating variable to be displayed; wherein the subsystem variable request message is formed based on the at least one subsystem and at least one operating variable presented in the menuing step and selected in the selecting step.
