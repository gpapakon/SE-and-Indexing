<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to metal pretreatment methods 
which do not involve the use of chromium compounds and, in 
particular, such methods which are useful in treating nonferrous 
metal surfaces and particularly aluminum, zinc and aluminum-zinc 
alloy surfaces. It is known to treat nonferrous metals and particularly 
aluminum, zinc and aluminum-zinc alloys with chromium compounds such 
as chromic acid to inhibit corrosion and promote adhesion with 
coatings. While effective, the chromium compounds, nonetheless, are 
undesirable because of their toxicity and the attendant problems of 
disposal. Hence, considerable work has been done in finding a 
replacement for the chromium in metal pretreatment. The present 
invention provides a treatment method which does not involve the use 
of chromium compounds. Also of interest as background to the present invention is 
FR-A-2443514 which discloses a surface treating solution for aluminum 
or aluminum alloys comprising aqueous solutions of inositol dihexaphosphates 
and water-soluble salts thereof in a mixture with 
titanium fluoride. The invention encompasses a method of treating a nonferrous 
metal substrate comprising contacting the substrate with an acid 
activating agent, and then contacting the substrate with a solution of a 
phosphoric acid ester of an epoxy compound or a phosphonic acid 
ester of an epoxy compound. The invention also encompasses 
a nonferrous metallic substrate treated by such method. The term 
"nonferrous" is meant to include metals other than iron, such as 
aluminum and zinc and alloys of aluminum and zinc, as well as alloys 
containing minor portions of up to 15 percent by weight iron. 
Preferably, the nonferrous metallic substrate contains no iron.  
 The acid activating agent is necessary to prepare the 
substrate for the subsequent treatment with the organophosphonate or 
organophosphate. It is believed that the acid activating step 
dissolves metal oxide films which may form on the nonferrous metal 
surface making the surface more receptive to the subsequently applied 
organophosphonate or organophosphate. The acid activating agent is desirably applied by 
contacting the metallic substrate such as by immersion or spraying at 
a temperature of from 50°F. (10°C.) to 180°F. (82°C.), preferably 
50°F. (10°C.) to 150°F. (66°C.), more preferably 
65°F. (18°C.) to 80°F. (27°C.). Usually it will have a pH of from 
2.4 to 4.0 and preferably from 3.0 to 3.7. The activating agent is 
preferably an aqueous solution of an acidic fluoride
