<CLAIMS>
A manual pipette system including a syringe (7) comprising a mounting 
portion (6) and a syringe plunger (10), and a manual pipette (1) which includes 

in a pipette housing (2) a retainer (5) for the mounting portion (6) and in a retaining 
member (19) a plunger retainer (18) for the syringe plunger (16), locking means 

(26,36) for reversibly locking the mounting portion and syringe plunger in their retainers, 
and plunger actuators (56,23) for displacing the retaining member (19) in 

the pipette housing (2), the mounting portion (6) and the syringe plunger (17) being 
adapted to be axially displaced through axial openings (9,20) of their retainers 

(5,18) to their locking positions, the locking means (26,36) including a manually 
actuatable, radially displaceable gripping means (28,36) for locking the mounting 

portion (6) and the syringe plunger (17) in their locking positions, the gripping 

means (28,36) having syringe gripping levers (28) pivotally mounted in the pipette 
housing (2) and plunger gripping levers (36) pivotally mounted in the receiving 

member (19), the syringe gripping levers (26) and the plunger gripping levers (36) 
each comprising a pair of arms, i.e. a gripping arm (29,38) and an actuating arm 

(30,39) for manual actuation, and the syringe gripping levers (26) having at their internal 
sides of their actuating arms (30) contact surfaces (33) adapted to be pivoted 

by actuation of their actuating arms (30) outwardly against the actuating arms (39) 
of the plunger gripping levers (36) so as to actuate the plunger gripping levers (36). 
The pipette system of claim 1, wherein the mounting portion (6) 
and/or the syringe plunger (17) when in their locking positions engage abutments 

(10,21) in the retainers (5,18) and the gripping means (28,38) are locking the 
mountain portion and/or the syringe plunger by engaging behind the abutments. 
The pipette system of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the mounting portion 
is a syringe flange (6). 
The pipette system of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the syringe 
plunger (17) has a plunger collar (37) adapted to be engaged behind by the gripping 

means (38).  
 
The pipette system of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the syringe griping 
lever (26) has a hook-shaped gripping end (28) for engaging behind the mounting 

portion (6). 
The pipette system of any of claims 1 to 5, wherein plunger gripping 
levers (36) have tapered gripping ends (38) for engaging behind the syringe plunger 

(17). 
The pipette system of any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the gripping means 
(28,38) have spring means (31,40) biasing them towards the mounting portion (6) 

and/or the syringe plunger (17). 
The pipette system of claim 7, wherein the spring means comprise leaf 
springs (31) axially extending from mounting means (32) in the pipette housing (2) 

and acting upon the actuating arm (30) of the syringe gripping lever (26). 
The pipette system of claim 7 or claim 8, wherein the spring means 
comprise leg springs (40) guided along pivot axes (35) of the plunger gripping lever 

(36), which leg springs have one leg engaging an abutment (41) of the retaining 
member (19) and having another leg engaging the actuating arm (39) of the plunger 

gripping lever (36). 
The pipette system of any of claims 1 to 9, wherein the syringe griping 
lever (26) and/or the plunger gripping lever (36) are disposed in radial cut-outs 

(25,34) of the pipette housing (2) and/or the retaining member (19). 
The pipette system of any of claims 1 to 10, wherein the gripping lever 
(26;36) have approximately similar lever arms (29,30; 38,39). 
The pipette system of any of claims 6 to 11, wherein the plunger griping 
levers (36) are shorter than the syringe gripping levers (26). 
The pipette system of any of claims 2 to 12, wherein the abutment (10) 
for the mounting portion (6) is supported in the pipette housing (2) via axially acting 

spring means (13).
