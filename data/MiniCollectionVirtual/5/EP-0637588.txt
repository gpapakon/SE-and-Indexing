<ABSTRACT>
An active oxygen inhibitor composition containing a coordinated complex represented by general formula 
(I) as the active ingredient (wherein R₁ and R₂ represent each independently hydrogen, C₁-C₁₂ alkyl, C₁-C₁₂ alkoxy, 

halogen, hydroxy, nitro, amino, carboxy or C₂-C₆ acyloxy; and M represents a central atom selected from among Cu, 
Mn and Zn); and a coordinated complex represented by general formula (II), wherein R
1-a
 and R
2-a
 are the same as the 
R₁ and R₂ defined in formula (I); and Ma represents either Cu or Mn, provided that the case where Ma represents Cu 

and each of R
1-a
 and R
2-a
 represents hydrogen, the case where R
1-a
 represents hydrogen and R
2-a
 represents hydroxy 
located either at the 4-position or at the 5-position, and the case where Ma represents Mn and each of R
1-a
 and R
2-a
 
represents hydrogen are excepted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coordinated 
complexes having a picolinic acid derivative as a ligand 
and an active oxygen suppressive composition containing 
the same as an effective ingredient. The active oxygen 
suppressing composition may be used to prevent or treat a 
disease arising from active oxygen in the body and to 
prevent various disorders arising due to active oxygen 
outside the body, especially is useful as a preservation 
solution of an organ. Along with the recent advances made in surgical 
techniques, immunosuppressive methods, etc., there has 
been an increase in the number of clinical cases of organ 
transplantation. When transplanting an organ, ideally 
the organ extracted from the donor is immediately 
transplanted into the recipient, but to enable effective 
utilization of precious organs for transplantation, it is 
necessary that organs are capable of being preserved for 
a long period. As methods for their preservation, there 
have been developed the method of low temperature 
preservation aimed mainly at suppression of metabolic 
action of the organ and the perfusion storage (or 
preservation method aimed mainly at maintaining the 
metabolic action. Various proposals have been made as to the 
preservation solutions used for the above preservation 
methods, for example, as in Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) No. 1-246201. Futhermore, generally speaking, the important matter 
regarding the composition of the preservation solution 
used in the low temperature preservation method is the 
capability to prevent edema in the tissue of organs to be 
transplanted and it is said that. The solution should  
 
contain effective ingredients so that 1) there is a 
suitable amount of substances hard to pass through the 
cell membrane and 2) the osmotic pressure is higher than 
that of plasma, 3) it is possible to prevent the 
occurrence of acidosis in the cell membranes, and 4) cell 
damage due to active oxygen is prevented. Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 1-246201 in 
particular was directed at an improvement with respect to 
the above point 1), but glutathione is used for the 
purpose of 4). As other substances besides glutathione 
used for the purpose of 4), it is known in the field of 
art to use allopurinol, superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
MgSO₄, etc. In any case, it may be said, however, that 
these studies have just all been started. Further knowhow 
needs to be built up in this area. According, the object of the present invention is to 
provide an

An active oxygen suppressive composition 
comprising, as an effective ingredient, a coordinated 

complex having the formula (I) and a carrier 
 

wherein, R₁ and R₂ independently represent a hydrogen 
atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, an 

alkyloxy group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, a halogen

wherein, R1-a and R2-a have the same definitions as R₁ and 
R₂ of the formula (I) and Ma is Cu or Mn, provided that 

when Ma is Cu, R1-a and R2-a are not simultaneously a 
hydrogen atom, when R1-a is a hydrogen atom, R2-a is not a 

hydroxyl group at the 4- or 5-position, and when Ma is 
Mn, R1-a and R2-a are not simultaneously a hydrogen atom.
