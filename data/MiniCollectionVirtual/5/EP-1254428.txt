<ABSTRACT>
A computational method that makes use of DNA molecules is disclosed. The method can be summarized as follows. First, a set of DNA molecules representing (by their sequences) all possible assignments to all variables of a given computational problem is generated (this is the so-called combinatorial library of the problem). Second, all the DNA molecules representing assignments which do not correspond to solutions of the problem are inactivated (blocked) for reproduction or detection. Finally, one has to check only whether any active (non-blocked) molecules remain: a solution of the problem exists if and only if any such molecules remain. In principle this allows to solve computationally difficult problems. We illustrate our method by outlining a solution for the famous satisfiability problem using both a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and a fluorescent quenching assay.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: A biological molecule based computing method based on a blocking principle.The present invention relates to the field of biology and computer science, in particular it relates to the use of biological molecules for computational purposes.Biological molecules such as nucleic acid and protein are complex polymers of rather simple molecules. DNA (deoxyribcnucleic acid) is an unbranched polymer used by organisms to store their genetic information. A DNA polymer is usually referred to as a DNA strand and is composed of monomer molecules, which are called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is connected to the next in a polymerization process. Nucleotides differ in their bases, of which some typical representatives are: adenine (A), guanine (G) , thymidine (T) or cytosine (C) . Considering that for each position in a DNA strand at least four possible bases are possible it is not difficult to imagine that many different sequences can be generated. In fact with each added nucleotide the number of possible combinations can be increased by a factor of four.So, a DNA strand comprises a segueÏ€ce; this is the sequence of the nucleotides from one end of the DNA strand to the other. The ends of a DNA strand are chemically different: one end is called the 5 ' end while the other end is the 3 ' end. So single-stranded DNA has a sequence and an orientation .There are several features of DNA molecules which makes them in principle attractive for computing purposes, we name here three of them: (1) Watson-Crick complementarity (2) the availability of natural enzymes which can recognize DNA sequences and (3) the potential for massive parallelism.The use of computing with biological molecules provides a potential for solving problems which presently do not have 

 feasible (m time) solutions within the available silicon based technology. Computing with biological molecules and m particular DNA molecules, can solve many of such problems, because the massive parallelism of DNA strands allows the trillions of operations taking place simultaneously.A natural target class of probl^ ms which require massive parallelism are the so-called NP complete problems (see for a description: M. R. Garey and D. S. Johnson, Computers and Intractability, A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness , W.H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco, 1979.). Perhaps the most famous of the problems from this class is the satisfiability (SAT) problem for Boolean formulas (explained below) . Adleman (L. M. Adleman, Science, 266: 1021-1024, 1994) was the first to
