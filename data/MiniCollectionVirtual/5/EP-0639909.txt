<ABSTRACT>
A resequencing system (DDM, TSG, IC, REG, SUB, RSU) 
is disclosed for resequencing the cells of a cell stream 

transmitted through the cascaded connection of a first 
switching node (SN'), a buffer register (OB) and a second 

switching node (SN). It includes : 

a resequencing means (TSG, IC, REG, SUB, RSU) associated to 
the second switching node (SN), 
a delay measurement circuit (DDM) associated to the buffer 
register (OB) and adapted to measure the time delay to which 

each of said cells is submitted in said buffer register (OB), 
means to communicate the delay thus measured for each cell 
to the resequencing means (TSG, IC, REG, SUB, RSU). 
 
After said cell has been switched by said second switching 

node (SN), the resequencing means (TSG, IC, REG, SUB, RSU) 
submits this cell to a time delay equal to the difference 

between a predetermined constant time delay value and the 
communicated delay.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resequencing 
system for resequencing the cells of a cell stream 
transmitted through the cascaded connection of a first 
switching node, a buffer register and a second switching 
node, and including a resequencing means associated to said 
second switching node. Such a resequencing system is already known in the 
art, e.g. from the article 'Design and Technology Aspects of 
VLSI's for ATM Switches' by T.R. Banniza e.a., IEEE Journal 
on selected areas in communications, Vol. 9, No. 8, october 
1991, pp. 1255 - 1264. Therein the resequencing system 
includes an input circuit between the buffer register and the 
second switching node which allocates a time stamp value 
provided by a time stamp generator to each of the cells 
applied to an input of the input circuit prior to these cells 
being switched by the second switching node. After this 
switching operation has been performed this cell is submitted 
by a resequencing unit to an additional variable delay which 
is so chosen that the total delay to which the cell is 
submitted between the input of the input circuit and an 
output of the resequencing unit becomes equal to a constant 
value. The output buffer temporarily stores the cells 
switched by the first switching node before forwarding them 
to the second switching node. Such an output buffer is needed 
in order to avoid possible output contention occurring when 
different cells coming from different inputs of the first 
switching node are switched to a same output of the first 
switching node within one cell time. Due to this output 
buffering the cells are subjected to additional non-constant 
delays, i.e. the cells are subjected to delay jitter. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
resequencing system of the above known type but wherein delay 
jitter is at least partly eliminated.  According to the invention, this object is achieved 
due to the fact that said resequencing system further 
includes a delay measurement circuit associated to said 
buffer register and adapted to measure the time delay to 
which each of said cells is submitted in said buffer 
register, means being provided to communicate the delay thus 
measured for each cell to said resequencing means which is 
adapted to, after said cell has been switched by said second 
switching node, submit this cell to a time delay equal to the 
difference between a predetermined constant time delay value 
and said communicated delay. In this way, the delay jitter caused by the buffer 
is
