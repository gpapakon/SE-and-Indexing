<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing photovoltaic
modules based on thin crystalline silicon.Photovoltaic modules based on crystalline silicon have been
produced for some time and are used to generate electrical energy.In currently used production methods, as described for example by
Martin A. Green in "Solar Cells, Operating Principles, Technology
and System Applications" Prentice-Hall Inc. N.J., the modules
consist of individual solar cells bonded together to form an
assembly of cells electrically connected together in series or
parallel. This assembly is then encapsulated between a high
transmittance glass sheet and a further sheet of glass or suitable
plastics material as rear protection. The entire unit is then
sealed with a polymer resin.These processes use silicon sheets having a thickness exceeding
350-500 µm.Process evaluation indicates that a considerable decrease in the
cost per watt can be achieved by reducing the thickness and hence
the quantity of silicon. The problem is that the fragility of the
material increases as the thickness decreases and the area 
increases, and in addition the photovoltaic module process
production yield falls drastically when the wafer thickness falls
below 300 µm.We have now solved these problems by a low-cost production process
for photovoltaic modules in which thin large-area wafers of
silicon are involved.In accordance therewith the present invention provides a process
for preparing photovoltaic modules based on mono and polycrystalline
silicon, as claimed in claim 1. Preferred features of the process are claimed in the
dependent claims 2-7. US-A-4,184,903 discloses a method for fabricating a photovoltaic module
wherein a plurality of electrically interconnected solar cells are bonded to a
rigid transparent support panel, comprising the steps of depositing on one
face of each solar cell a film of substantially transparent adhesive,
positioning said one face of each cell in contiguous relation with a common
surface of a transparent support panel and simultaneously vacuum-bonding
said plurality of cells to the panel.FR-A-2,481,522 discloses a method for fabricating a photovoltaic module
comprising the steps of depositing on a face of a silicon disk, doped
with electrically active impurities, a dopant containing
compound via silk screen process, of
diffusing the dopant agent by heating at high temperature to produce on the silicon disk a superficial layer
of the other conductivity type of forming
contacts on the front part and rear part of the active
