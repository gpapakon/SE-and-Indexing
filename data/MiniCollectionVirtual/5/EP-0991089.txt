<ABSTRACT>
A composite inductor includes a block (2) made of resin
or rubber having a magnetic material dispersed therein.

Spirally wound coils (11, 12, 13, 14) are buried in the block
(2) so that the coil axes of the coils (11, 12, 13, 14) are

arranged in the same direction. The end portions of the coils
(11, 12, 13, 14) are electrically connected to external

electrodes (21a to 24a, 21b to 24b) provided on two surfaces
of the block (2) substantially at a right angle to the axes of

the coils (11, 12, 13, 14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite inductor
element. More particularly, the present invention relates to
a composite inductor element constructed to function as an
anti-noise component in personal computers and other
electronic apparatuses.In recent years, software in personal computers has
become more and more complicated and advanced. In order to
perform instructions contained in such software at high speed,
the clock frequency of CPUs in personal computers has greatly
increased.Personal computers have a plurality of types of power
supply circuits such as power circuits to drive CPUs, power
circuits to drive circuits other than the CPUs, power circuits
to drive hard disks, floppy disks and the like, and so on.
Among these power circuits, although there are supplying
currents as large as tens of amperes, as in the power circuits
for driving CPUs having high clock frequencies, there are also
other supplying currents as small as hundreds of milliamperes.
In each of these power circuits, an anti-noise component
having a current capacity corresponding to each supply current 
is separately required. Up to now, a single element having a
current capacity corresponding to the current capacity of each
of the power circuits has been used as an anti-noise
component.However, when the above single elements are used in the
power circuits of personal computers to function as an anti-noise
component, many different types of anti-noise are
required. Accordingly, there is a problem that the cost of
anti-noise components is greatly increased and the space
occupied by the anti-noise components also increases.To overcome the problems described above, preferred
embodiments of the present invention provide a composite
inductor element which has a significantly reduced cost and
greatly reduced space requirement as compared to conventional
anti-noise components.According to a preferred embodiment of the present
invention, a composite inductor element includes a plurality
of coils buried in a block made up of at least either resin or
rubber having magnetic material dispersed therein and the end
portions of each of the coils are electrically connected to
external electrodes provided on the block. The coils have
different electrical characteristics such as current capacity,
inductance, and other characteristics.Therefore, in the block, coils constructed in accordance 
with the noise and current capacity specifications of power
circuits in personal computers, and other apparatuses, are
buried. In this way, a plurality of
