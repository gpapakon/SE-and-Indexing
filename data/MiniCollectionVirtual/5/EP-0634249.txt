<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a device for the serration of new knife 
blades by

 
means of a grinder (16) with an external cylindrical surface 

grooved circularly, to be performed on a new blade (12). The 
device includes a unit (13) designed to rotate/translate and 

support a sample blade (11) having a serration which interacts 
with the fixed locator element (15) that is toothed and of the 

rack-type, and a chuck unit (14) designed to rotate/translate with 
said sample blade support unit (11) and which supports the new 

blade (12) to be serrated by said grinder (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic device for the 
serration of knife blades by means of a grinder. Knife blades are usually serrated by means of a grinder in 
which each blade to be serrated is positioned by an operator. 
According to the state of the art, the peripheral surface of the 
grinder, view in cross section, must be shaped complementarily 
to the blade to be serrated. This evidently requires the use of a 
differently shaped grinder for each type or shape of blade, and 
means it is difficult to dress the grinders when necessary. The 
result is increased tooling and running costs for a knife blade 
serrating unit and the permanent risk of danger to the operator 
working in contact with the grinder. The aim of this invention is to overcome these 
inconveniences by means of a new original solution to the 
problem of serrating knife blades of different shapes. In accordance with the present invention there is provided 
a device for serrating knife blades which uses a grinder  
 
substantially with a cylindrical peripheral surface, hence not 
shaped, although grooved circularly, and a ready-made sample 
blade to be copied for serrating each new blade. Thus, the operation of serrating a new knife blade 
substantially becomes the result of a reproduction, or copying, 
of a sample blade, the latter being used as a template and 
interracting with a rack-type toothed locator to govern the 
movements of a chuck onto which is secured the blade to be 
serrated in relation to the grinder. To this end, this invention provides a device for serrating 
knife blades according to claim 1. There are thus the advantages of: 
eliminating the need for differently-shaped grinders for each 
type of blade; being able to use grinders that have a simpler structure and are 
more economical; using, with the same serration results, the same grinder for 
each and every blade shaped, merely by replacing the sample 
blade;  increasing the safety of the operator, who can work at a 
distance from the grinder, thus reducing the risks deriving from 
the use of abrasive grinders, such as explosion of the grinder, 
microfragmentation, which is dangerous for the eye, contact with 
coolants, etc.; and, last but not least, of providing an automatic blade loading/unloading system to 
increase the productivity of the system. Further details of this invention will become more evident 
from the description made with reference to the diagrams here 
attached, in which:

<CLAIMS>
2. A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the unit 
(13) supporting the sample blade (11) and the chuck unit 

(14) are superimposed and mounted to rotate on a first slide 
(17) that runs horizontally and parallely to the axis of the 

grinder (16), and in that said first slide (17) runs along a 
second slide (19) that is supported in turn and runs 

horizontally on a stationary plane (21) at right angles to the 
direction of movement of the first slide (17). 
3. A device according to claims 1 and 2, in which said units 
(13, 14) and said slides (17, 19) are equipped with means 

for operating and controlling their movements. 
4. A device according to any preceding claim, in which the unit 
(13) supporting the sample blade moves in such a way that 

the sample blade engages the rack-type locator element 
thus determining the movement of the blade to be serrated 

on the chuck (14) in relation to the grinder.
