a (Crystal-5 value of at least 40 % and a ratio of

(Crystal-5: N
20
) of at least 0.55

<DESCRIPTION>
Edible fat based, flavoured fat systems suitable for use in
baked goods and snacks are known from US 5 431 945 or
US 4 356 643 or US 5 447 735. From these documents butter
based fat flakes are disclosed in US '945. These flakes are
free of sugar and contain a lot of predried butter fat and
high contents of dried milk solids. Particulars of the fats
that can be applied are not given, all that is said about
the nature of the fats that can be applied is that they are
related to butter fat. According to US '643 cheese based
flakes can be obtained along lines that are very similar to
the lines set out above for US '945. These flakes contain
high levels of dried cheese solids while the fats that can
be applied are the same or very similar to the fats
according to above US '945. According to US '735 cinnamon
based flakes can be obtained that contain large amounts of
granulated sugar while the fat is again a butter fat or a
fat, closely related to butter fat.

The processing of the flakes in all three above US
documents is very complicated and require a tempering step
which is costly and difficult to perform in practise.

We therefore performed a study to find out whether we could
find compositions for the flakes, in particular for the fat
in the flakes that would enable an easier processing.
During this study we found that one of the main problems
related with the use of butter fat or butter fat related
fats is the slow crystallisation rate of the fats. Because
of this slow crystallisation rate a tempering step had to
be used. We found that if the fats display a (Crystal-5)-value
of at least 40 %, (crystal-5 being the amount of
crystallised fat, obtained after cooling the fat to 20 °C 
for 5 minutes) and have a specific ratio between Crystal-5
and its N20-value this tempering can be avoided and improved
products can be obtained in a shorter time while using
easier processing. Simultaneously our novel bakery
products, made from these flakes, displayed an excellent
snap.GB 2 176 143 discloses fat flakes or fat granules, wherein
the fat applied is selected from margarine, butter or lard
(p.1,1.13-14). These flakes are used for cooking purposes
and not as an ingredient for the preparation of bakery
products, wherein the flakes must give a good flavour boost
and must provide the bakery products with a good snap. As
margarine and butter are fat emulsions containing about 20
wt% of water the use thereof in flakes that contain sugars
is very limited because the sugars will be dissolved in the
water phase of the fat

Crystal 5-value of at least 40 %, while the ratio (Crystal
5:N20) i.e. the ratio between the amount of crystallised

fat obtained after cooling the fat to 20 °C for 5 minutes
(= Crystal 5) and the N-value obtained by NMR pulse on a

non-stablised fat at 20 °C (=N20) is more than 0.55,
preferably more than 0.60

0 to 80 wt% of sugar; preferably selected from sucrose,
dextrose, fructose and glucose

0 to 70 wt% of a filler material;
which edible fat based system has a particle size between

0.05 mm and 2.5 cm.

a total amount (H3+H2M+H2E) of more than 30 wt% (on total
glycerides present), preferably more than 35 wt% and the

triglycerides H2U in an amount of less than 25 wt% (on
total glycerides), the balance being other glycerides based

on H,M,U and E, wherein H= saturated fatty acid with 16 -
