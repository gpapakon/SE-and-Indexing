<ABSTRACT>
A composition suitable for use in making vibration damping material 
includes an alicyclic resin, an isocyanate reactive component and an isocyanate. The 

vibration damping material can be molded into a desired, complex shape or can be 
used in a vibration damping member that includes a layer of the vibration damping 

material and at least one steel sheet. The vibration damping material can include a 
filler by applying the filler to a cavity surface prior to introducing the composition 

into the cavity. The isocyanate index can be shifted from 100 to achieve improved 
hot fusing ability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a composition to make vibration 
damping material for use in vibration damping moldings, vibration damping members 
and to a method of making the vibration damping material. More specifically, this 
invention relates to a composition for making a polyurethane vibration damping 
material whose molecular chains can be varied to achieve the desired vibration 
damping. Equipment such as domestic appliances, (e.g., washing machines, 
dryers, refrigerators, air conditioners, fans and the like), vehicle bodies, chassis of 
equipment, (e.g., copiers and the like), vibrate due to moving parts (e.g., motors, 
fans, moving carriages and the like) or external forces (e.g., the road over which a 
vehicle is driven) exerted on the equipment. The vibration may cause excessive wear 
on the equipment, create undesirable noises and shorten the life of the equipment. A viscoelastic layer of vibration damping material having a high 
modulus of elasticity is used to lessen vibration and the associate problems. The 
vibration damping material can be molded into shape as by injection or protrusion 
molding or a sheet can be bonded to a steel sheet to make a vibration damping 
member. The vibration damping material has long molecular chains that are 
tangled with each other. When a force is applied to the molecular chains so as to 
move these chains, energy is consumed until the stress caused by the force distorts  
 
the chains. A vibration damping effect is obtained by the chains consuming this 
energy. To increase the damping capability, it is required to effectively design the 
molecular chains taking into account the molecular weight, molecular structure of a 
monomer starting material, the degree and type of branching of the molecule, the 
cross-linking form of the molecular networks, the cross-linking density, the form of 
copolymerization, the morphology/microstructure, (e.g., crystalline or amorphous), 
and the like. Conventionally utilized vibration damping materials having long chain 
molecules, such as polyisobutylene rubber, polyvinyl chloride, polynorbomene 
rubber, ethylene-propylene diene terpolymer (EPDM), 1,2-polybutadiene rubber, 
natural rubber (NR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) and dicyclopentadiene resin, are 
usually produced prior to being incorporated into the vibration damping material. 
Therefore, it is difficult to design the molecular chain to increase vibration damping 
capability. In most conventional epoxy and polyurethane vibration damping 
materials, a
