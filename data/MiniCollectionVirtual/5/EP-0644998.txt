<ABSTRACT>
A water meter has a glass window (30) having an aperture (32) through which extends one or more screw threaded terminals (20) enabling electrical connection to be made to an internal electronic encoder. A resilient grommet (34) is positioned in the aperture (32) and is held in compression between inner and outer sealing plates (36, 38). These are drawn together by the terminals which carry nuts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vapour barriers and particularly to
methods and arrangements for passing electrical terminals through a glass
wall, in vapour tight fashion.In the most important example, the present invention relates to
metering assemblies in which there is a dual requirement for a transparent
window - enabling viewing of an internal number wheel or other display - and
an electrical terminal passing through the transparent window - enabling a
connection to be made between remote meter reading equipment and circuitry
within the meter.Examples of meters without a display viewable through a window in
the meter housing can be found in US-3,093,973 and US-3,599,022.
These include sealing means for leading a connection through a meter
housing.The example will be taken of a water meter, a traditional form of
which comprises a bronze or copper housing having water inlet and outlet; a
metering unit within the housing, a number wheel display and a glass cover
through which the display can be read. There is more recently a requirement
for such meters to be read electronically and circuitry has been developed
which, in combination with the number wheel display, provides an electronic
representation of the meter reading. Water meters are typically provided in
pits, basements or other inaccessible locations and the electronic encoding
facility enables the meter to be wired to a more conveniently located reading
unit. This may take the form of a simple, slave display. More usually, the
reading unit enables remote interrogation through communication with a
portable reader unit or communication over telephone, radio or other links
with a central reading station. It is a requirement of the market that, in addition to the remote
reading facility, the water meter should continue to have a number wheel or
other display directly viewable at the meter. The meter housing must
therefore continue to include a transparent window.DE-A-1774578 discloses a flow meter having a transparent window.
Electrical impulses, generated by a reed switch, are led out by wires through
the housing, to the side of the window.Because water meters are often mounted in pits or other constricted
locations, it is only from the top that access to the meter can be guaranteed.
It is therefore necessary or desirable for electrical connection to be made
through the transparent window. Prior proposals have achieved this by
forming the transparent window from plastics material, moulded about the
electrical terminals. This solution appeared to offer

<CLAIMS>
A metering assembly comprising a housing having a transparent
window; a metering unit disposed in the housing and having a display viewable

through the window; electronic encoding means within the housing, connected
to the metering unit to provide an electronic representation of the reading;

and terminal means enabling connection to be made externally of the metering
assembly with the encoding means, wherein the window is formed of glass

having an aperture, the terminal means extends through the aperture and
sealing means are provided to form a vapour seal between the terminal means

and the glass window.
An assembly according to Claim 1, wherein the sealing means
comprises a body of resilient material abutting the terminal means and the

glass window, in compression.
An assembly according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the
sealing means comprises a grommet located at the glass aperture and having at

least one through bore for the passage of the terminal means.
An assembly according to Claim 3, wherein the terminal means
comprises at least two terminals and wherein the grommet comprises a through

bore for each of the terminals.
An assembly according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the sealing means comprises an annular flange abutting the external

surface of the glass window at the margin of the aperture. 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the sealing means comprises a grommet clamped in compression.
An assembly according to Claim 6, wherein the grommet is

comprises at least one terminal having screw thread engaging parts.
An assembly according to Claim 1, wherein the sealing means
comprises a first clamping plate disposed externally of the glass window and

having at least one terminal hole; a grommet located at the glass aperture
and having at least one terminal bore; a second clamping plate positioned

internally of the glass window and having at least one terminal hole; and at
least one terminal extending through the first and second clamping plates and

the grommet, the terminal having screw thread engaging parts, relative
rotation of which serves to draw together the first and second clamping

plates.
An assembly according to Claim 9, wherein the terminal means
comprises at least two like terminals, each extending through the first and

second clamping plates and through the grommet.
An assembly according to Claim 9 or Claim 10, wherein the
grommet comprises a flange which abuts the external surface of the glass

window at the margin of the aperture. 
An assembly according to Claim 11, wherein the flange has an
annular projection engaging the external surface of the glass window.
An assembly according to any one of Claims 9 to 12, wherein a
screw thread engaging part of each terminal is held against rotation in one

of the clamping plates.
An assembly according to any one of Claims 9 to 13, wherein the
grommet has an integral boss extending into each terminal hole of the first

clamping plate.
An assembly according to any one of Claims 9 to 14, wherein the
first clamping plate has an annular skirt projecting toward the glass window

to provide environmental protection for the grommet.
A terminal structure for establishing an electrical connection
through a glass window in vapour proof fashion, comprising a first
