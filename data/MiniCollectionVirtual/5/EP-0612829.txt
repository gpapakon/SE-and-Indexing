<ABSTRACT>
A process for deasphalting and demetallizing petroleum vacuum 
distillation residues using dimethylcarbonate (DMC) in the 

presence of an overpressure of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and 
comprising: 


mixing a vacuum distillation residue with dimethylcarbonate 
(DMC) under a pressure of CO₂, under temperature and pressure 

conditions such as to maintain the DMC in a prevalently liquid 
state, and forming a homogeneous solution with the deasphalted 

oils; 
cooling the entire system to a temperature such as to form 
three phases; 
then venting the gas at this temperature; 
recovering a deasphalted and partly demetallized primary oil 
from the light phase; 
recovering a deasphalted and partly demetallized secondary oil 
from the intermediate phase; 
 
f) recovering the used DMC for its possible reuse.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for deasphalting and 
demetallizing petroleum vacuum distillation residues. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for 
demetallizing and deasphalting said residues using 
dimethylcarbonate (DMC) in the presence of an overpressure of 
carbon dioxide. Vanadium and other metals, such as nickel and iron, are present in 
crude oil mainly in the form of porphyrinic and asphaltenic 
complexes. The metal content and the ratio of the two types of 
complex depend essentially on the age of the crude and the 
severity of conditions during its formation. In some crudes the 
vanadium content can reach 1200 ppm and the porphyrinic vanadium 
content can vary from about 20% to about 50% of the total 
vanadium. The vanadium present in the crude has a deleterious effect on the 
refinery operations in that it represents a poison for catalysts 
used in catalytic cracking, hydrogenation and hydrodesulphurization. 
Vanadium present in fuel oil combustion products 
catalyzes the oxidation of sulphur dioxide to sulphur trioxide, 
leading to corrosion and the formation of acid rain. In addition  
 
metal porphyrins are relatively volatile and when the crude is 
vacuum-distilled tend to pass into the heavier fractions of the 
distillate. Hence traces of vanadium are usually found in vacuum-distilled 
gas oils. In refinery operations it is usual to use deasphalted oil (DAO) as 
feed to the fluid catalytic cracking. Consequently the oil is 
subjected to preliminary deasphalting as the asphaltenes tend to 
form coke and/or consume large quantities of hydrogen. The 
asphaltene removal also results in removal of the asphaltenic 
vanadium and nickel and of organic compounds with heteroatoms, 
especially nitrogen and sulphur. Industrial practice is 
specifically to deasphalt the crude distillation residues (resid) 
with propane or by the ROSE (resid oil solvent extraction) 
process, which uses light hydrocarbons chosen from propane, n-butane 
and n-pentane. In this respect reference should be made to

Crudes", Petroleum Refiner, 36 (5), 247-250 (1957); J.A. Gearhart

Processing, May 1976, 125-128; and S.R. Nelson and R.G. Roodman,

Engineering Progress, May 1985, 63-68. Specifically, deasphalting with propane is conducted in RDC 
(rotating disk contactor) columns at an overhead temperature not

A process for deasphalting and demetallizing petroleum 
vacuum distillation residues using dimethylcarbonate in the 

presence of an overpressure of carbon dioxide and comprising the 

following steps: 

a) mixing a vacuum distillation residue with dimethylcarbonate 
under a pressure of CO
2
, under temperature and pressure conditions 
such as to maintain the dimethylcarbonate in a prevalently liquid 

state, with the formation of a homogeneous solution; 
b) cooling said homogeneous solution to a temperature within the 
miscibility gap of the dimethylcarbonate/deasphalted and 

demetallized oil (DAO) system but lower than the boiling point of 
dimethylcarbonate at atmospheric pressure, with the formation and 

gravimetric stratification of three phases, namely: 1) an oil-rich 
light liquid phase; 2) a dimethylcarbonate-rich intermediate 

liquid phase; 3) a semisolid heavy phase containing essentially 
all the asphaltenes and a substantial part of the metals initially 

present in the vacuum distillation residue, in addition to a small 
amount of oil; 
c) then venting the CO
2
 at a temperature essentially equal to 
the temperature of step b) until a pressure close to atmospheric 

is reached; 
d) recovering a deasphalted and partly demetallized primary oil 
from the light liquid phase; 
e) recovering a deasphalted and partly demetallized secondary 
oil from the intermediate liquid phase; 
f) recovering, and possibly reusing, the dimethylcarbonate from  
 

the light liquid phase, from the intermediate liquid phase and 
from the asphaltenic phase.
