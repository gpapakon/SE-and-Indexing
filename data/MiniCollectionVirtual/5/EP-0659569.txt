<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a printer with a single printing motor and a single non-contact oven, characterised in that it comprises a printing width and a paper passage width (30) greater than that of a double breadth of between 18.5" (46.99 cm) and 20.5" (52.07 cm), and a selective control of the writing heads (T1, T2) either for using them as a single group for printing a centred double-breadth web or for using them as two groups of heads for jointly printing two single-breadth webs separated by a margin, the two groups of heads or each group of heads being capable of being supplied with an ink colour.

<CLAIMS>
Printer with a single print motor and a single non-contact 
heater characterized in that it comprises a printing 

width and a paper-passage width greater than that of a 
double width comprised between 18.5" (46.99 cm) and 20.5" 

(52.07 cm) and a selective control of the writing heads, 
either for using them as a single group to print a centred 

double-width strip, or for using them as two groups of heads 
(T1, T2) to print concomitantly two single-width strips 

separated by a margin (13), the two groups of heads (T1, T2) 
or each group of heads being capable of being supplied with 

one colour of ink (Cl). 
Printer according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
selective control of the heads for printing a pattern by 

each group of heads on a single strip takes account of the 
spatial discrepancy introduced by a double-strip collating 

device with two turning bars (40, 41). 
Printer according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises a device (60 to 64) for diverting without turning 

a single-width strip printed with a first colour of ink (Cl) 
on one side by a first group of heads (T1) to the second 

group of heads (T2) supplied with another colour of ink (C2) 
to allow two-colour printing. 
Printer according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises a device (50 to 54) for diverting and turning a 

single-width strip printed on one side in one colour (Cl) by 
the first group of heads (T1) to the second group of heads 

(T2) supplied with ink of the same colour (Cl) to allow 
double-sided printing with the same colour. 
Printer according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in 
that the selective control of the groups of heads is 

effected so as to take account of the spatial discrepancy  
 

introduced by the diversion device. 
Printer according to Claim 3, characterised in that two 
two-colour-printing printers (1A, 1B) are associated in 

series, the second printer (1B) printing on a first side 
with the second group of heads (T'2) and the non-turning 

diversion device (60B to 64B) ensures the routing of the 
strip leaving the second group of heads (T'2) of the second 

printer towards the first group of heads (T'1) of the second 
printer arranged to the left of the second printer. 
Printer according to Claim 4, characterised in that two 
double-side printers are associated in series, the second 

printer printing on the back of the single-width strip with 
the second group of heads (T'2), the second colour (C2) of 

the two-colour pattern and the diversion and turning device 
(50B to 54B) of the second printer (1B) ensuring the routing 

of the strip leaving the group of heads (T'2) located to the 
right of the printer towards the group of heads (T'1) 

located to the left of the printer (1B) to produce on the 
front side of the strip the impression of the pattern in the 

second colour (Cl). 
Printer according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that each group of heads or both groups of 

heads are supplied with one colour of ink. 
Printer according to Claim 1, characterised in that two 
printers are associated in series, the two single-width 

strips or the double-width strip leaving the first printer 
(1A) being turned over by a turning device (70 to 74) before 

being fed into the second printer. 
Printer according to Claim 1, characterised in that two 
printers with different ink colours are associated in 

series, the single-width strip leaving the left-hand channel 
of the first printer (1A) being turned over by a turning  

 
device (70 to 74) before introduction into the left-hand 

channel of the second printer (1B) to be printed in an ink 
of a different colour. 
Printer according to Claim 1, characterised in that two 
printers are associated in series, and the second of which 

is supplied with two different colours of ink (Cl, C2), each 
associated with a group of heads (T'1, T'2), the strip 

leaving via the left-hand routing of the first printer being 
turned over in a turning device (70 to 73) to be fed into 

the left-hand routing corresponding to the first group of 
heads (T'1) of the second printer (1B) supplied with the ink 

(Cl) of the same colour as the first printer (1A) whereas 
the right-hand strip leaving the first printer (1A) returns 

directly to the second printer (1B) to be printed by the 
second group of heads (T'2) of the second printer (AB) 

supplied by the second colour (C2). 
Printer according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the print motor is of the 

magnetographic type. 
Printer according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the print motor is of the 

electrophotographic type. 
Printer according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the print motor is of the ionographic 

type. 
Printer according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the print motor is of the thermal 

type. 
Printer according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the print motor is of the ink-jet 

type.  
 
Printer according to one of Claims 6 to 11, 
characterised in that a first motor is of a type 

corresponding to one of Claims 13 to 16 and the second motor 
is of another type corresponding to one of Claims 13 to 16.
