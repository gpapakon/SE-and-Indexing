<ABSTRACT>
The roof opening is edged by U-channels (4) around all four sides. The rigid panel (3) has its edges with downwards facing lips (7,11) which locate in the roof channels to form a flush fitting. Elastic seals (10) over the roof edge lips (6) seal the panel when closed. The U-channels run round the four sides of the opening and have rearwards extension on each side to enable water to drain away with the slipstream or when the vehicle is washed. The interlocking profiles of the panel and the roof opening are produced by rolling/pressing.
