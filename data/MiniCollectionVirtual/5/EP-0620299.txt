<ABSTRACT>
Unit to bear spindles which is suitable for spinning 
machines, twisters and also for two-for-one twisters and 

comprises a support (11) including two opposite sides (13a-13b), 
each of which bears at least one main bearing (30) 

coaxial with an opposite main bearing (30), the axis of 
these bearings (30) being substantially at a right angle to 

the opposite sides (13a-13b), each bearing (30) holding a 
shaft (19) which bears an interposed pulley (20a) and 

protrudes from the respective opposite sides (13a-13b), each 
shaft (19) supporting a respective spindle (16), the support 

(11) being equipped with an at least partly removable 
lateral plate (12) and constituting a spindle-bearing frame 

(10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a unit to bear spindles, 
as set forth in the preamble of the main claims 1 and 2. The unit to bear 
spindles according to this invention is applied 
advantageously to the textile industry and especially to 
spinning machines, twisters and two-for-one twisters. Spindles on textile machines of the state of the art have 
a rotary shaft and are borne on bolsters with roller 
bearings or ball bearings, (see e.g. DE-A 24 28 851 disclosing the most relevant state of the art). The spindles are fitted above the spindle-bearing frames 
and are rotated at a speed of about 15,000 r.p.m. or more. 
The spindles are generally rotated by a belt which runs in 
the air. There may be the situation of a plurality of spindles 
installed on the same spindle-bearing frame and cooperating 
with the same belt driven by one single motor or the 
situation of a shaft bearing a plurality of pulleys, each of 
which actuates a belt that actuates a spindle. The spindle-bearing systems of the state of the art entail 
the problem of being unable to ensure that at least two 
spindles rotate at the same speed, for this same speed of 
rotation is necessary to achieve an excellent doubling of 
two yarns, for instance. In fact, the spindles nowadays either are set in rotation 
individually by different motors or are driven by the same 
motor, to which they are connected by a belt, but neither of 
these two methods ensures a good synchronized rotation of 
two spindles. Moreover, with the spindle-bearing systems of the state of 
the art the spindles are arranged on only one side, 
generally the upper side, of the machine, and this situation 
involves a great overall bulk of the machine owing to the  
 
great number of spindles fitted to a machine. Furthermore, the spindle-bearing systems of the state of 
the art entail the drawback that owing to the high speed of 
rotation of the spindles the transmission belt vibrates in 
the air and generates unpleasant vibrations and noises. These vibrations and noises are greater when one belt 
drives a plurality of spindles. So as to obviate this noise, proposals have been made that 
the transmission belt should be eliminated and that each 
spindle should be driven by a high-frequency motor 
positioned also on the same axis as the spindle. This system, however, increases the cost of the machine 
considerably and makes it uncompetitive on the market 
precisely owing to the necessity, determined by the state of 
the art, of having to use a high-frequency motor so as to be 
able to
