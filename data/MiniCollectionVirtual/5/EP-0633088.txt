<ABSTRACT>
An electrolyte is circulated between the surface to be machined, charged to an anodic potential, and a working electrode (9') charged to a cathodic potential. The electrolyte contains lithium nitrate as sole active element at a concentration of between 20 g/l and 2350 g/l and preferably between 50 g/l and 250 g/l. The method can be applied to machining the surface of any metallic part and especially to machining the inner surface of tubular parts (5) such as nuclear reactor vessel bottom head or head penetrations; in this case, the electrochemical machine cell consists of a cylindrical working electrode (9') placed inside the part to be machined.

Process for electrochemical etching of metallic 
materials, with removal of material, which consists of 

causing an electrolyte to circulate in contact with the 
surface which is to be etched, bringing said surface to 

an anodic potential, placing a tool electrode which has 
been brought to a cathodic potential close to the part 

which is to be etched and passing a current between the 
tool electrode and the part, characterised in that the 

electrolyte used contains lithium nitrate (LiNO
3
) as the 
sole active substance. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that:
 
   the concentration of lithium nitrate in the 

electrolyte is between 20 g/l and 2350 g/l, and
 
   the current density passing through the electrolyte 

is between 2 A/cm
2
 and 400 A/cm
2
. 
Process according to claim 2, characterised in 
that:
 
   the concentration of lithium nitrate in the 

electrolyte is between 50 g/l and 250 g/l, and
 
   the current density passing through the electrolyte 

is between 5 A/cm
2
 and 50 A/cm
2
. 
Process according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised 
in that: 


(i) the electrolyte is prepared in a tank (14) by 
injecting water and reagents, 
(ii) the electrolyte solution is circulated in a 
circulation loop, 
(iii) the solution is filtered to remove its 
hydroxide precipitates, 
(iv) the filtered electrolyte is returned to the 
loop, and  

 
(v) the pH of the solution is regulated by 
injecting a pH controlling agent. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that, at the end of the etching, the 

space between anode and cathode and the etched surface 
is rinsed by circulating a rinsing liquid in this space. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, used 
for etching the cylindrical inner surface of a tubular 

part such as the base passage of a tank (5) in a 
pressurised water nuclear reactor, or an adapter (8) 

passing through the lid of the tank, characterised in 
that the electrolyte is circulated in a sealed annular 

apace located betwen the cylindrical tool electrode (9') 
and the inner surface of the part to be etched. 
Apparatus for carrying out the process according to 
claim 6, wherein the etching cell comprises a tool 

electrode (9') brought to a cathodic potential, which is 
cylindrical in shape and of such dimensions as to be 

accommodated inside the part to be etched, ducts (11', 
12') enabling the electrolyte to be supplied and taken 

away, two diffusers (10a, 10b) ensuring the circulation 
of the electrolyte and the rinsing liquid in the 

anode/cathode gap, whilst controlled joints (13a, 13b) 
make it possible to isolate the anode/cathode gap which 

is to be treated from the rest of the tube.
