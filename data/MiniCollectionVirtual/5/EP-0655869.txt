processing a stereoscopic image signal for a stereoscopic 

image which is composed of a plurality of images is 
arranged to receive a plurality of image signals for the 

plurality of images, to time-base-compress the image 
signals received, to form a composite image signal by 

combining the time-base-compressed image signals, to 
multiplex an information signal for information which is 

other than images but corresponds to the contents of the 
plurality of images, and to output the composite image 

signal to a transmission route. The arrangement enables

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stereoscopic image
processing apparatus arranged to record on a recording
medium a stereoscopic image signal corresponding to a
stereoscopic image which is composed of, for example, left
and right images or to reproduce from the recording medium
and display the stereoscopic image thus recorded.Fig. 1 roughly shows the essential parts of the
conventional TV system. Referring to Fig. 1, the system
includes an antenna 46 which is provided for receiving
image information sent from various broadcasting stations.
A video tape recorder (VTR) 47 is arranged to receive the
image information through the antenna 46 and to record the
image information on a video tape.Further, in reproducing and displaying the image
information, the VTR 47 reads out from the video tape a
desired part of the image information. The image
information read out is sent to a TV monitor 48 to output
images and sounds relative to them from the TV monitor 48.The number of programs of image information has
rapidly increased during recent years. The method for
supplying these programs also has been diversified to
include ground broadcasting, satellite broadcasting, cable
broadcasting, etc. As a result, the number of programs
concurrently available has increased. The kinds of image information recording media
also have increased to include optical disks, etc.,
besides video tapes. These recording media have come to
permit recording images at a high degree of definition
over a long period of time. For example, some of the VTRs
of the NTSC system has, in addition to a standard mode, a
triple mode in which image information can be recorded and
reproduced over a length of time which is three times as
long as the recordable length in the standard mode.Meanwhile, a stereoscopic image display
apparatus for viewing a stereoscopic image has been
contrived with a parallax between two eyes utilized for
giving a vividly lifelike image. A method for making a
stereoscopic image viewable with this stereoscopic image
display is as follows: An image is picked up, for
example, by arranging two image pickup systems by
separating their optical axes as much as a distance
corresponding to a distance between the left and right
eyes of the viewer (a parallax or a base length). The two
images thus obtained from the two image pickup systems
(hereinafter referred to as images with a parallax), i.e.,
the image for the right eye, and the image for the left
eye are linearly polarized in different directions. These
images are then compositely
