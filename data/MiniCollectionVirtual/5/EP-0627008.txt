<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of a melanic pigment by enzymatic bioconversion, implementing a melanin precursor substrate and plant cells, characterized in that: (a) poppy (Papaver somniferum) plant cells previously cultivated are separated from their culture medium and subcultured in a culture medium with a concentration from 10 to 100 g/l; (b) the cells are ground at least partially, before or at the end of the latency time, (c) the at least partially ground cells are placed in a bioconversion medium in the presence with a melanin precursor substrate selected among indol, indolin, dihydroxyphenylalanin, tyramin and tyrosin; (d) the precipitated melanic pigment is collected. The invention also relates to the utilization of such resulting pigments for the preparation of cosmetic compositions.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing a melanin pigment by
enzymatic bioconversion, employing a melanin precursor

substrate and plant cells, characterized in that:

a) poppy (Papaver somniferum) plant cells
previously cultured, are separated from their culture

medium and subcultured in a culture medium at a concentration
ranging from 10 to 100 g/l,
b) the cells are at least partially ground
before or at the end of the latency time,
c) the at least partially ground cells are
brought into contact, in a bioconversion medium, with a

melanin precursor substrate chosen from indole,
indoline, dihydroxyphenylalanine, tyramine and tyrosine,
d) the precipitated melanin pigment is
recovered.
Process according to claim 1, characterized
in that the culture medium in which the previously

cultured cells are subcultured, has a concentration of
between 20 and 50 g/l.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the substrate is brought into contact with

a ground cell preparation.
Process according to claim 3, characterized
in that the ground cell preparation is obtained by

grinding the cells, previously separated from their
culture medium, at a temperature of between 0 and 15°C.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the contacting of the at least

partially ground cells with the substrate is carried out
with stirring.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that the contacting of the at least
partially ground cells with the substrate takes place at

a temperature of between 10 and 70°C.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the contacting of the said cells 

with the said substrate is carried out in a buffered
solution whose pH varies between 3 and 9.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the precipitated pigment is

recovered by filtration, decantation or centrifugation.
Process according to claim 8, characterized
in that the precipitated pigment is recovered by

filtration of the bioconversion medium through a screen
of mesh size less than 5 µm.
