<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for regulating the flow rate of a fluid material, including an entrance receptacle (1) and an exit receptacle (4) releasing the material at a flow rate regulated by an exit aperture (6), these two receptacles (1, 4) being separated by a common wall (6). The common wall (6) extends from the bottom walls (2, 5) of the receptacles (1, 4) and, above the common wall (6) is located a so-called bell (9) arrangement forming, on either side of the common wall (6), a first (10) and a second (11) intermediate receptacle in which a gas pressure (P) is maintained.

A device for regulating the flow rate of a fluid, the device
comprising an inlet receptacle (1) for the fluid, which receptacle

comprises a bottom wall (2) and receives the fluid that is delivered
at an arbitrary rate, the receptacle containing the fluid up to a

fill-up level (3), the device further including an outlet receptacle
(4) which has a bottom wall (5) and which releases fluid at a

regulated flow rate via an outlet opening (6), the two receptacles
(1, 4) being separated from each other by a common wall (6) that

includes a top edge (7), the device being characterized in that the
common wall (6) extends from the bottom walls (2, 5) of the

receptacles (1, 4) to a height that is lower than the fill-up level
(3) of the inlet receptacle (1), and in that a "bell" contrivance (9)

is disposed over the common wall (6) to form first and second
intermediate receptacles (10, 11) on either side of the common wall

(6), the first intermediate receptacle (10) communicating with the
inlet receptacle (1) via a first passage (12) extending along the

bottom (2) thereof, the second intermediate receptacle (11)
communicating with the outlet receptacle (4) via a second passage

(13) extending along the bottom (5) thereof, the two intermediate
receptacles (10, 11) communicating with each other via a third

passage (14) extending over the common wall (6) where a gas pressure
(P) is maintained, the two intermediate receptacles being closed

[apart from said three passages (12, 13, 14)] and being connected to

a device (15, 16) for maintaining the gas pressure (P).
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that said bottoms
(2, 5) are horizontal, and the intermediate receptacles (10, 11) are

symmetrical about the common wall (6).
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the outlet
opening (6) has the same height as the top edge (7) of the common

wall (6).
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
the device for maintaining the gas pressure comprises a gas feed 

device (15, 16) and a gas leakage device (19), one of said devices
being regulated.
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that the gas feed
device (15) is connected to the topmost level of the "bell"

contrivance (9).
A device according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the gas
feed device (16) is connected to the bottoms (2, 5) on either side of

the common wall (6).
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
said third passage (14) is constituted by a plurality of orifices

(17).
A valve for regulating the outflow of fluidized solids from a
fluidized bed boiler, the valves being constituted by a device

according to any preceding claim.
