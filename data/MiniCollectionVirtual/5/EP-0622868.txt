<ABSTRACT>
A data communications outlet kit is generally shown 
at (2) comprising a mounting frame (4), an outlet 

connector module (6) and an external outlet cover (8). The 
outlet connector module comprises a housing (12) an edge 

connector (10) and a connector insert (14), whereby the 
edge connector (10) is for electrical connection between 

a data communications cable (64) and the insert (14) and 
the insert (14) is for making electrical connection 

between the edge connector (10) and an external connector 
(120), such as a modular plug (120). The outlet connector 

housing (12) comprises an outlet housing box (16) 
integrally moulded to an outlet box cover (18) by a thin 

breakable webs (22), and to the cover are integrally 
moulded strain relief means (20) that can be broken off 

the cover. Two different strain relief means are provided, 
one for a smaller cable diameter range and the other for 

a larger cable diameter range. On the cover are tapered 
pegs (42) for provisionally supporting the strain relief 

means (20) to the cover (18) whilst mounting the cover to 
the rear of the outlet housing box (16). The pegs (42) are 

tapered and engage in holes in the strain relief means 
(20) such that the strain relief means can be held thereon 

with a wedge affect. The insert (14) is inserted in a 
front cavity portion of the outer housing box (16). The 

assembled outlet connector (60) can be securely mounted to 
the outlet mounting cover by tilting the outlet connector 

such that the diagonal formed by an upper rear corner 
(140) and a lower front corner (142) of the outlet 

connector is roughly parallel to the plane of a base (130) 
of th
e outlet cover. The outlet connector (6) is secured 
to the outlet cover (8) by resilient integral latching 

means (144) on the cover and the cover (8) can then be 
secured to the mounting frame (4) with screws (150).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a kit for a data
communications outlet as defined in the preamble of claim 1.The need for a flexible wiring arrangement and
provision for future applications has been increasingly
important in the building industry. In order to adapt to
the rapidly changing technology and also, for example, to
the future growth of a company and their data
communications needs, it is desirable that the
communications connections between the various rooms of a
building be quickly readaptable to a new wiring
arrangement. In the past, as the data communication
requirements grew, extra cables often had to be installed
within the building, this being very expensive and adding
a mass of wires, increasing repair and maintenance times
which also required specialists.In order to overcome these problems, the
communications cabling concept has changed to a more
flexible system, for example as shown in publication WO-A-87/07775,
whereby a multiple purpose data communications
cable (for example comprising data and/or telephone cables
apart from the standard insulated electrical conducting
wires) is distributed throughout the building and
connecting these cables to the communications outlet.
These outlets are designed such that there is an insert
that makes data communications connection between a wall,
floor or structure mounted connector box which is
connected to the cable, and a user plug connected to a
portable device for example. If this portable device is to
be removed and replaced by another device requiring a
different data communications connection, the insert is
quickly removed from the connector box and replaced with 
another insert adapted to receive the plug of the new
device.Thus, WO-A-87/07775 discloses a communications outlet kit comprising
the features indicated in the pre-characterising portion of claim 1.Depending on the users needs therefore, the inserts
are usually offered separately from the outlet connector
box.This outlet connector box is mounted separately to a
structure, and it is desirable to have an outlet connector
that can be installed in many different types of
structures such as a wall or a floor or a cable canal, in
order to satisfy as many needs as possible with only one
set of parts.It is also desirable to offer kits for assembly that
have as few loose pieces as possible as this reduces the
inventory and handling costs.To enable the fixed outlet connector to be
installable in many different structures, it is often
necessary that the required mounting depth within the
structur
