<ABSTRACT>
Serial printer having a printing support conveying lid 
(20,27) formed by a rigid plate (20) hinged to the printer and 

extending for the whole lenght of the print line (15) the plate 
being provided with a resilient lip (27) having a free edge (28) 

located immediately dowstream of the print line (15), spaced apart 
from a platen (1) for a rest position of the lid and in contact 

with the platen (1) for an active position of the lid, the lid 
being held in rest position by resilient bias means (32) and 

driven in working position by the interference with the lid of 
pressure pads (34,35,37) steady with the printing head (5) 

slidable along the print line (15), when the printing head is 
located along the print line in a position other than a travel end 

position, in which interference does not occurr.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a serial printer provided 
with a printing support conveying lid. Impact dot matrix serial printers are more and more used in 
the modern data processing systems. In such printers the printing support managing functions are 
performed, as much as possible, in automatic way, without need of 
operator manual intervention. Printing on supports of different kind, such as continous, 
multiple or single copy forms and single sheets is also provided. The printing support must be precisely led to and away from 
a printing platen, extended transversely to the movement direction 
of the printing support, so as to be inserted between the platen 
and a printing head, movable along the platen in close proximity 
thereto. The perfect contact of the printing support to the platen is 
of essence for obtaining reliable operation, good printing quality 
and low level of printing noise. To meet this requirement printing devices are known where a 
rotating platen, cooperating with pressure rollers, performs the 
driving function for single sheets. These devices may be easily combined with mechanisms which 
move away from and approach the pressure rollers to the platen, in 
order to allow for the loading of single sheets, but these devices  
 
are unsuitable for loading of continuous forms. In order to feed continous forms, particularly multiple copy 
forms, fanfold bent, it must be resorted to pin tractors which are 
preferably located downstream of the platen and pull the form. The tractors may be combined in pairs to perform a pull on 
the form, downstream of the platen and a push action toward the 
platen upstream of it. The automatic loading of the continuous forms is, in such 
cases, unfeasible and the severing of a printed portion of the 
form from the residual portion is performed by cutting or tearing 
the form downstream of the tractors, so that the platen is 
permanently engaged with the residual continuous form. Recently multifunctional printers have been proposed which 
can alternatively print on both single sheets and continuous form. 
One such printer is shown in EP-A-0 358 192. In these printers the rotating platen, coupled to pressure 
rollers, provides to feed the single sheets and a tractor pair, 
located upstream of the platen, provides to feed the continuous 
form. In this case the tractors works in push mode and by suitable 
reversing their motion, once the printed portion of the module is 
severed from the residual portion, it becomes possible to free the 
printing

<CLAIMS>
Serial printer wherein a printing support is pushed, by 
support feeding means, toward a platen (1) elongated in a direction 

defining a print line, so as to interpose between a printing head (5) 
and said platen, with a movement of said support perpendicular to 

said print line, said printing head being movable along said print 
line at a predetermined distance from said platen, between two end 

positions of said print line,
 
characterised in that it comprises: 


a support conveying lid (20, 27) extending along said print line in 
spaced opposition to said support feeding means, relative to said 

print line, said lid being hinged in said printer with a 
rotational axis parallel to said print line, said lid comprising 

a resilient lip (27) extending along said print line, immediately 
downstream of said print line, for the whole length of said print 

line but a zone (30) comprised between one of said end positions and a 
position intermediate to said end positions, 
resilient means (32) for biasing said lid in an angular rest 
position in which said resilient lip is spaced apart from said 

platen, and 
interference means (34, 35) steady with said printing head, 
interfering with said lid for every position of said printing head 

other than said zone and causing a 
rotation of said lid bringing said lip in contact with said platen 

for the whole extension of said lip along said print line. 
Printer as claimed in claim 1, wherein said interference 
means comprise a pressure pad interfering with said lid, said lip 

having a recess cut at one of said end positions, said recess cut 
preventing interference of said pressure pad with said lip when 

said print head is in said one end position. 
Printer as claimed in claim 2 comprising an intermediate 
support of said lid, removably mounted in said printer. 
Printer as claimed in claim 2 where said interference means 
comprises two pressure pads between which the nose of a needle 

printing head is interposed.
