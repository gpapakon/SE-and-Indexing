<ABSTRACT>
A gamma ray or x-ray detector for borehole use
includes a cadmium zinc telluride crystal having the

general formula Cd
1-x
Zn
x
Te, where x represents the zinc
fraction of the material and preferably is within the

range of 0.05 ≦ x ≦ 0.95. The noise edge and energy
resolution characteristics of the detector may be

improved by surface treating the crystal to reduce
leakage current. The detector has particular

application to bulk density and photoelectric
absorption factor logging.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detector for detecting
x-rays or gamma rays and, more particularly, to an
improved CZT detector that is useful for detecting
x-rays or gamma-rays in a high temperature environment
such as an oil well borehole.In nuclear borehole logging, e.g. in gamma ray-based
density and lithology logging, it is important
that the gamma ray detectors employed be able to
operate at the high temperatures typically encountered
in boreholes without undue noise or loss of energy
resolution. Borehole temperatures of 150°C-175°C
and above are not uncommon. Thus historically
scintillators and gas tubes have been used as x-ray
and gamma ray detectors in nuclear logging tools
because of their superior high temperature performance,
notwithstanding that such detectors are inferior to
solid state detectors (e.g., germanium, silicon and
cadmium telluride) in energy resolution, size and
noise. This is principally because in most borehole
applications, detector noise, dominated by detector
leakage current (which is highly temperature
sensitive), limits the usefulness of solid state
detectors. The use of solid state detectors in
borehole logging tools, therefore, has heretofore
required a dewar and/or other cooling devices to hold
the detector at a low operating temperature to maintain
energy resolution and low noise. This cooling 
requirement substantially offsets any advantage of size
afforded by solid state detectors, and further has a
limiting effect on the useful lifetime of the detector in
the borehole. There has long existed, therefore, a need for
a solid state x-ray or gamma ray detector that operates
efficiently at high temperatures over a sustained time
period without the requirement for cooling.CZT is a relatively new, solid state, gamma ray/x-ray
detector material that is marketed commercially by Aurora
Technologies Corporation of San Diego, California. See,
e.g., Butler, J.F., et al., Cd1-xZnxTe Gamma Ray Detectors, in
Proc. 1991 IEEE Nucl. Sci. Symp. and Med. Imaging Conf.,
vol. 1, pp. 129-133 (Nov. 1991). It is grown by a high
pressure, vertical Bridgman technique which yields boules of
approximately four inches diameter and length. CZT is a
ternary compound with a variable stoichiometry and is
usually designated by the general formulae Cdi-xZnxTe, where x
represents the zinc fraction of the material. For x ≈ 0.20,
the CZT detector marketed by Aurora Corporation has a
bandgap of 1.53 eV, an effective Z of 48, a density of 5.806
g/cm3, and a bulk
