<ABSTRACT>
An earth globe includes a base and a hollow globe body 
made of translucent material and having a spherical 

configuration corresponding substantially to the earth. A 
first support mechanism serves to rotatably support the 

globe body relative to the base around a first axis 
corresponding substantially to the earth axis. An 

illumination device and a shading device are disposed within 
the globe body. The shading device serves to shade light 

from the illumination device over a substantially half 
region of the globe body. A second support mechanism is 

provided to rotatably support the shading device relative to 
the globe body around a second axis corresponding 

substantially to an axis perpendicular to the orbital plane 
of revolution of the earth around the sun. A first and a 

second drive device are provided to rotate the globe body 
around the first axis at a first rotational speed and to 

rotate the shading device around the second axis at a second 
rotational speed different from the first rotational speed, 

respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an earth globe.A conventional earth globe includes a spherical globe
body on which a map is drawn. The globe body is rotatably
supported by a base around an axis which is inclined
relative to a vertical axis and which corresponds to the
earth axis. A user can therefore refer to a particular part
of the map by rotating the globe body, and such rotation may
represent the rotation of earth.In some designs, the earth globe is so constructed as
to show a day region and a night region on the earth. Such
an earth globe includes a hollow spherical globe body made
of translucent material. The spherical globe body includes
a lamp and a shading plate therein. The shading plate
serves to prevent a predetermined half area of the spherical
globe body from being irradiated by light of the lamp. With
this construction, when the lamp is lit, the predetermined
half area shaded by the shading plate is dark as viewed from
the outside, while the remaining half is bright due to the 
irradiation of light. Therefore, the user can distinguish
the day and night areas from each other based on the state
that the light is irradiated thereto or not.Meanwhile, the earth revolves around the sun or
performs an orbital movement while rotating around its own
axis or the earth axis. Since the earth axis is inclined
relative to the axis perpendicular to the orbital plane of
the earth, the light from the sun is irradiated to the
earth in different ways in response to changes of position
of the earth along the revolution orbit (changes of the
season). Therefore, in order to show the change of night
and day (change in the direction of sunlight) in response to
changes of the season, the user requires to change the
position of the lamp as well as the position of the shading
plate within the spherical globe body.Earth globes shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 have been proposed
to permit such changes of positions of the lamp and the
shading plate. The earth globe shown in FIG. 5 includes a
spherical globe body E rotatable around an axis
corresponding to the earth axis. A vertical shaft J is
disposed within the spherical globe body E and extends
through the center of the spherical globe body E. A lamp L
and a shading plate P are mounted on the vertical shaft J.
A knob T manually operable by the user is disposed outside
of the spherical globe body E. A gear mechanism H is 
disposed within the spherical globe body E for transmitting
rotation of the knob T to the vertical shaft J. Thus, when
the user turns the knob T, the lamp L
