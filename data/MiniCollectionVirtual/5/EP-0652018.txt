<ABSTRACT>
Transducer-protector device (1) for biomedical haemodialysis 
lines, comprising a body of moulded plastic material having a 

first tubular connector of the female Luer Lock type (2) with 
a conical inner surface (4) and an outer threading (3) and a 

second tubular connector (33), provided with respective first 
and second radial flanges (7, 10) for their mutual permanent 

sealed connection and between which a filtering membrane of 
permeable material (12) is interposed. The female Luer Lock 

connector (2) with the respective outer threading (3) is 
entirely formed of a material having higher elasticity

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to transducer-protector 
devices for biomedical haemodialysis lines, of the type 
comprising a body of moulded plastic material having a first 
tubular connector of the Luer Lock female type with a 
conical inner surface and an outer threading, intended to be 
connected to a tube of a haemodialysis equipment, a second 
tubular connector coaxial to the first tubular connector, 
said first and second tubular connectors being provided with 
respective first and second annular radial flanges for their 
mutual permanent sealed connection, and a filtering membrane 
made of a permeable material and defining an anti-contamination 
sterile barrier transversally interposed 
between said first and second tubular connectors and having a 
peripheral edge clamped between said radial flanges. Transducer-protector devices of the above-referenced type 
constitute essential elements in biomedical haemodialysis 
lines which put the dialysis equipment in connection with the 
patient. The primary function of the transducer element in 
the dialysis equipment is to continously monitor the 
patient's blood pressure. The protection function consists of 
providing a sterile barrier protecting the operators, the 
dialysis equipment and the patient from risks of 
contamination by virus-infected blood, both in liquid state 
and in aerosolized state, as well as to filter out any 
particles which might be contained in an air stream possibly 
fed back to the equipment for its blast cleaning. Traditionally the body of the transducer device is made 
of a high resistance and high rigidity plastic material, 
normally polycarbonate, so as to stand sterilization 
operations (normally vapour and/or gamma rays sterilization  
 
or the like) before the device is put on the market. Since 
normally the connection between the first tubular connector 
and the haemodialysis equipment tube is performed through a 
male Luer connector made of metal (normally stainless steel) 
of that tube, there is the risk of a non perfectly hermetic 
connection, actually deriving from the high stiffness of the 
material of which the first tubular connector is 
traditionally made. As a matter of fact, even the smallest 
imperfection in the female and male Luer Lock coupling may 
result in a leakage of fluid from the connection and, 
therefore, in a consequent error in the measurement of the 
patient's blood pressure. A solution to this problem consists of manufacturing the 
conical inner surface of the Luer Lock connector with a 
mater
