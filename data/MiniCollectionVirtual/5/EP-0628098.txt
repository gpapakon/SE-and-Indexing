<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for continuously decatizing a fabric (4) on a cylinder (1) at a temperature at least sufficient to avoid condensation, wherein the damp or wet fabric is sandwich-like compressed between said cylinder and a continuous, water-tight carrier web (2), possibly rigid, a high mechanical pressure is applied which is obtained by means of rotatable cylinder (6) having the rotation axis parallel to the central cylinder axis and being strongly pressing against the latter said carrier web while squeezing at the same time the intermediate cloth web. Thus is also obtained a steam sealing action for the completion of which also two rubberized gaskets are preferably provided at both sides of the hot cylinder. The pressure cylinders, except for the first one met by the web, are heated at a high vaporization temperature (160-180  DEG C) if the central hot cylinder is at only about 100  DEG C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
apparatus for continuously decatizing fabrics on a 
cylinder with local steam generation. A method of continuous decatizing is known, as 
well as the relevant apparatus, for a dimensional 
conditioning of fabrics by causing them to pass about 
a very hot rotating steel cylinder, e.g. at a temperature 
of 160-180°C. From DE-A-3.412.982 it is known to 
feed the previously damp or wet fabric between said 
heated cylinder and a water-proof endless (ring-shaped) 
web or back cloth which is moved forward at the same 
speed as the hot cylinder and subjected to a great 
tensile strength so that it can apply an important 
pressure onto the fabric in contact with the hot cylinder. 
The moisture contained in the fabric evaporates 
to produce steam. Still according to this prior art, since the 
water-proof, extremely taut, is also provided with 
some elasticity and is larger than the fabric to be 
treated, the generated steam cannot outflow as it is 
stopped by the elastic web under tension on one side 
and, on the other side, by the hot metal cylinder. 
The steam has thus the tendency to get compressed 
with augmentation of its pressure untill exceeding, 
also slightly, the atmospheric value and being able 
to exert a high temperature action at a greater pressure 
than the atmospheric one, as if the fabric were in 
autoclave. It is also known that the required high tautness  
 
for the water proof web, not only to squeeze the 
fabric, but also to avoid steam leakages, gives rise 
to a number of inconveniences and to an anomalous 
wear of the web itself. Furthermore, in spite of high 
values of web tension, the squeezing pressure on each 
cm of cloth results to be relatively poor owing to 
the amplitude of the surface on which squeezing is 
exerted. For example, with a tensioning or pulling 
strength of 40.000 kg applied onto the web, if its 
surface in contact with the cylinder (through the 
cloth) is of 10.000 cm2 (approximately corresponding 
to a cloth of 150 cm in height extending in contact 
with the web along about 70 cm), the squeezing action 
will be of only 4 kg/cm2. Since at present it has been fully demonstrated 
that to obtain good results of dimensional conditioning 
of fabrics the mechanical squeezing is a basic 
factor, and perhaps the most important, it is an object 
of the present invention to provide an improved 
continuously decatizing apparatus through which a 
strong squeezing can be obtained with a good tightness 
for steam even without applying

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for continuously decatizing 
fabrics (4) on a heated cylinder (1) at temperature 

of at least 100°C, sufficient to locally generate 
steam upon contacting a previously moistened or 

soacked fabric (4), and to prevent the generated 
steam from condensation, said fabric being fed 

between said hot cylinder (1) and a water-tight web 
(2) continuously wound in an endless fashion 

between two steam-tight points on cylinder (1), 
respectively of inlet (A) and outlet (B), whereby 

said web (2) and fabric (4) form a continuous 
sandwich being fed forward at the same rotation 

speed of cylinder (1) about its axis (X-X), 
characterized by further comprising one or more 

pressing cylinders (6) located at the outside of 
said cylinder (1) and capable of rotating at the 

same peripheral speed about respective axes which 
are parallel to each other and to the axis (X-X) of 

cylinder (1), there being provided means (7) for 
pushing said pressing cylinders (6) against the 

outer periphery of said cylinder (1) while 
squeezing at the same time said sandwich formed of 

said water proof web (2) and fabric (4) between 
said points (A,B).  

 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said pressing cylinders (6) are heated, 

except for the first of them getting in touch with 
the said web (2). 
An apparatus according to claim 2, characterized 
in that said pressing cylinders (6) are heated 

at a high temperature for vaporization of fabric (4). 
An apparatus according to anyone of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said pushing  

 
means (7) are pneumatic or oleodinamic cylinder-piston 

systems whose action is exerted onto the axes of cylinders 
(6) in a direction perpendicular to the surface 

of cylinder (1). 
An apparatus according to anyone of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said web (2) 

is essentially without elasticity and the pressing 
cylinders (6) are at least in number of two, the first 

and the last of which are respectively coincident 
with the said points (A, B). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said web (2) is of elastic character 

and acts as a sealing for the steam having a width 
larger than that of fabric (4), between said points 

(A, B) there being provided only one pressing cylinder

An apparatus according to anyone of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that at both sides 

of cylinders (1), in a zone comprised between the peripheral 
edges of fabric (4) and web (2), of greater 

width, two circumferential rubberized gaskets (5, 5') 
are applied to said cylinder for sealing the steam in 

an axial direction, in co-operation with the water-tight 
web (2).
