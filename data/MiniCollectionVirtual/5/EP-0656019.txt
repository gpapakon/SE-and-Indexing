<DESCRIPTION>
This application is directed to a
linseed oil copolymer composition, a method of making
same and a polymeric vehicle and a formulated coating
composition which include the linseed oil copolymer
composition described herein. More particularly, this
application is directed to a copolymer of linseed oil and
dicyclopentadiene which provides a new polymeric vehicle
and which also provides a liquid diluent to provide a
blended polymeric vehicle comprising two or more resins.
The polymeric vehicle of the invention provides a
formulated coating composition which is capable of being
air dried at ambient temperature and which is low in
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), yet provides low
viscosities which facilitate application to a substrate
with existing equipment.For about the last fifty years, protective and
decorative coatings based upon various polymeric resins
have been increasingly used. These polymers have been
utilized in many applications because they have provided
a wide range of strength, flexibility, toughness,
adhesion, degradation resistance and other film
properties. Many polymers, however, are in dispersions
or are solution polymers because they are prepared and
used as a part of dispersions or solutions of polymers in
organic solvents. In coatings technology, polymeric
vehicles which include thermoplastic polymers require the
use of organic solvents which often are toxic and/or
subject to regulation that demand their reduction in
coating compositions. Environmental concern has become increasingly
important. This concern not only extends to preservation
of the environment for its own sake, but extends to
safety for the public as to both living and working
conditions. VOCs resulting from coating compositions
which are applied and used by industry and by the
consuming public are often not only unpleasant, but
contribute to photochemical smog. Governments have
established regulations setting forth guidelines relating
to VOCs which may be released to the atmosphere. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
established regulations relating to the amount of VOCs
released to the atmosphere, such regulations being
scheduled for adoption by the states of the United
States. Guidelines relating to VOCs, such as those of
the EPA, and environmental concerns are particularly
pertinent to the paint and industrial coating industry
which uses organic solvents which are emitted into the
atmosphere.Polymerization reaction products of linseed oil
