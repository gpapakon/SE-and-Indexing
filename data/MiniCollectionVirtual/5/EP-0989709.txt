<ABSTRACT>
The method involves transmitting data into a second storage device (3) of an apparatus (4) whose first store already contains a first amount of data. Information on the first data quantity is accessible in a data processing facility (1) connected to the apparatus. The data to be transmitted in the second store is divided into first (7,8) and second (9,10) types of data sets, of which the first type is identical to parts of the data quantity held in the first store (6) of the apparatus and must not be transmitted from the data processing facility, while the second type of data sets has no correspondence to the first data quantity. The data sets of the second type are transmitted from the data processing facility to the apparatus.

Method for transmitting data to a second memory (3) of a communications terminal (4) which is connected to a communications network (5) and the first memory (6) of which

- already contains a first quantity of data,
- information about the first quantity of data being available in a data processing device (1) which is connected to the communications terminal (4),
characterized in that
- the data which are to be transmitted to the second memory (3) of the communications terminal (4) are divided into data records of a first type (7, 8) and data records of a second type (9, 10), of which the data records of the first type (7, 8) are identical to parts of the first quantity of data in the first memory (6) of the communications terminal (4) and thus do not need to be transmitted by the data processing device, and of which the data records of the second type do not have a counterpart in the first quantity of data, and
- the data records (9, 10) of the second type are transmitted from the data processing device (1) to the communications terminal (4).
Method according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

structure data packets (7', 8') containing information about source and destination memory start addresses for transmitting the data records of the first type (7, 8) within the communications terminal (4) as well as about the length of the respective data records of the first type (7, 8) are transmitted, in addition to the data records of the second type, from the data processing device to the communications terminal (4) .
Method according to Claim 2,
characterized in that

the structure data packet (s) (7', 8') which has (have) already been transmitted is(are) used to copy, within the communications terminal (4), the relevant data records of the first type (7, 8) from first areas (which are denoted by the source memory start addresses) of the first memory (6) to second areas (which are denoted by the destination memory start addresses) of the second memory (3) after at least one structure data packet (7', 8') has been transmitted and irrespective of the transmission of further data between the data processing device (1) and the communications terminal (4)
