<ABSTRACT>
Permanent magnet structure for producing a stable and homogeneous magnetic induction in a given volume, including a magnetic circuit formed by a yoke made of soft magnetic material and of two N and S poles terminating in flat, parallel pole pieces delimiting the given volume between them, with a gap open to the outside and an association of magnets made of hard ferrite materials and of FeB(R) to constitute the magnetomotive force of the structure, characterised in that the magnets of the two preceding types are stacked in series, parallel to the pole pieces between the latter and the yoke, their induction having a direction perpendicular to these pole pieces.
