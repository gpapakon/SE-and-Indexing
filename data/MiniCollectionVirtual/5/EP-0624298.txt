Communications system for establishing telecommunication 
connections, especially facsimile and 

telephone connections, with a first control system (CC), 
with internal telecommunication terminals (FAX1, FAX2, 

Tll, Tlx) and a memory device (FMS) which buffer-stores 
telecommunication messages and comprises a plurality of 

receiver-specific memory areas (FMS1...FMSy), characterized 
in that the memory device (FMS) can be connected via 

a/b connections (P1...P4) to the communications system, 
in that the communications system has pseudo subscriber 

ports (PTP1...PTPy) which can be connected to exchange 
lines (AL1, AL2, ALn) and are specific to call numbers, 

in that a control program assigned to the first control 
system (CC) is designed in such a way that calls assigned 

to the pseudo subscriber ports (PTP1...PTPy) are diverted 
to subscriber line ports (SLMP1...SLMPx) with an item of 

information designating the respective pseudo subscriber 
port (PTP1...PTPy), in that a second control system (CS) 

forms an a/b connection address (P1...P4) in dependence 
on the information designating a pseudo subscriber port 

(PTP1...PTPy), in that the first control system (CC) 
switches a call present at the subscriber line ports 

(SLMP1...SLMPx) with the information designating a pseudo 
subscriber port (PTP1...PTPy) in a way corresponding to 

the a/b connection address (P1...P4) to the associated 
a/b connection (P1...P4), and in that the second control 

system (CS) switches the call to a memory area (FMS1... 
FMSy) specific to the pseudo subscriber port and specific 

to the receiver, in order that the telecommunication  
 

connection is established and the storing in the memory 
area (FMS1...FMSy) of telecommunication messages transmitted 

during the course of the telecommunication connection 
is released. 
Communications system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that a call diversion can be activated 

to the pseudo subscriber ports (PTP1...PTPy) for internal 
terminals (FAX1, FAX2, T11, Tlx), in the case of the line 

being busy or there being a fault. 
Communications system according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the program assigned to the control 

system (CC) is designed in such a way that, triggered by 
the input of a code number designating the reading-out of 

telecommunication messages and of a memory-area-specific 
address into an internal telecommunication terminal 

(FAX1, FAX2, T11, T1x), the first control system (CC) 
causes the second control system (CS) to read out the 

corresponding telecommunication messages, and in that the 
first control system (CC) feeds the read-out telecommunication 

message to the internal telecommunication 
terminal (FAX1, FAX2, T11, Tlx).
