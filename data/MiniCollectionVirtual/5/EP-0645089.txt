<CLAIMS>
A fungicidal mixture containing 

a) the oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I 

 
and 
b) a dithiocarbamate (II) selected from the group 

manganese ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate) (zinc 
complex) (IIa), 
manganese ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate) (IIb), 
zinc ammoniate ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate) (IIc) and 
zinc ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate) (IId) 
 
in a synergistically active amount. 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, containing the 
oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and manganese ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate) (zinc complex) 
(IIa). 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, containing the 
oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and manganese ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate) (IIb).  
 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, containing the 
oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and zinc ammoniate ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate) 
(IIc). 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, containing the 
oxime ether carboxamide of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and zinc ethylenebis(dithiocarbamate) (IId). 
A fungicidal mixture as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
weight ratio of the compound II to the compound I is from 

2000:1 to 5:1. 
A process for controlling harmful fungi, which comprises 
treating the harmful fungi, their environment or the plants, 

seeds, soils, surfaces, materials or spaces to be kept free 
from them with the compound of the formula I as claimed in 

claim 1 and the compound of the formula II as claimed in 
claim 1. 
A process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the compound I as 
claimed in claim 1 and the compound II as claimed in claim 1 

are applied simultaneously jointly or separately, or in succession. 
A process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the harmful fungi, 
their environment or the plants, seeds, soils, surfaces, materials 

or spaces to be kept free from them are treated with 
from 0.005 to 0.5 kg/ha of the compound I as claimed in 

claim 1. 
A process as claimed in claim 7, wherein the harmful fungi, 
their environment or the plants, seeds, soils, surfaces, materials 

or spaces to be kept free from them are treated with 
from 0.1 to 10 kg/ha of a compound II as claimed in claim 1. 
The use of the compound I as claimed in claim 1 for the production 
of fungicidally active synergistic mixtures as 

claimed in claim 1. 
The use of a compound II as claimed in claim 1 for the production 
of fungicidally active synergistic mixtures as 

claimed in claim 1.
