<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
memory device, more particularly, a nonvolatile memory
which can be electrically rewritten, for example, a
semiconductor nonvolatile memory device such as a flash
EEPROM.As a symmetrical arrangement of a bit line and an
inverted bit line having a complementary level to this in
a semiconductor memory device, for example, a dynamic
random access memory (DRAM) circuit, there is a so-called
differential type sensing circuit (including flip-flop
type), wherein, to produce a reference level for a
differential sense amplifier, a reference cell referred to
as a dummy cell corresponding to a storage cell is
arranged in the inverted bit line on the opposite side to
the side for reading data.Conventionally, it has been impossible for a flash
EEPROM, particularly a NAND type, to adopt the so-called
folded bit line method which is advantageous for the
enhancement of speed etc. and has been adopted in a DRAM
circuit etc. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 1, there has been adopted
an open bit line system (refer to for example Document 1:
"A Quick Intelligent Program Architecture for 3V-only NAND
EEPROMS"; Sympo. VLSI Cir. pp 20 - 21. 1992) in which data
lines DLR and DLL which become symmetrical lines around a
sense amplifier (SA) 1 are separated in terms of position,
and memory cell arrays (MCAR) 11 and (MCAL) 6 are
connected as the storage cells and dummy cells (DCLR) 14
and (DCLL) 5 to the respective data lines (DR) 15 and (DL)
2.In the above-mentioned open bit line system, however,
even though lines are in a symmetrical arrangement, they
are separated in terms of position, and therefore there is
liable to be an imbalance in the electrical
characteristics between the symmetrical lines. Further, it
is not possible to completely equalize the noise voltage
resulting from connection from another conductive body
such as a peripheral circuit to the symmetrical lines.
Therefore, the influence of the noise is larger than that
of the folded bit line system and it is difficult to
achieve an enhancement of sensitivity of the sense
amplifier, resulting in a problem that the enhancement of
speed was difficult.As a result, an NAND type cell has been considered as
a low speed and large capacity memory, and the random 
access time becomes about 1 µs.Also, as shown in Fig. 2, to construct the folded bit
line system, a divided bit line system having a divided
bit line structure (document 2: "High Speed Page Mode
