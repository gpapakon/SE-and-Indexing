<ABSTRACT>
In a method for producing a tubular article (1) having 
a circumferential accumulation of material, the tubular 

article (1) is formed with first engagement means (6) 
for engaging corresponding second engagement means on a 

separate ring (5), which is pushed over the article (1) 
to the position where the accumulation of material is to 

be provided until the engagement means are brought into 
permanent engagement with each other, so that axial displacement 

of the ring (5) is prevented and the accumulation 
of material is formed. 
The method is especially well suited for producing 
such bottles as are to have a circumferential thick 

flange at the opening (4). 
A device for carrying out the method comprises a 
tool having means (7) for expanding the ring (5) and 

applying it on the article (1) in the position where the 
accumulation of material is to be provided, thus establishing 

the engagement between the cooperating engagement 
means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a
device for producing a tubular article having a circumferential
accumulation of material.Relevant background art on which the preambles to appended claims 1
and 2 are based, is disclosed in EP-A-0 549 987.In the production of tubular plastic articles having
a relatively thin wall, it is often desired to arrange a
circumferential accumulation of material on some part of
the article. One example of this is an injection liquid
container or vial which at its opening should have a
substantial accumulation of material to form a circumferential
flange on which a closure means in the form of
a cap or a cork is to be applied. In many cases, the
accumulation of material should be 3-10 times the wall
thickness of the container.Plastic articles of this type are generally produced
by conventional techniques, such as extrusion blowing,
starting from an extruded hose which is finally shaped in
a special tool. Providing, in connection with such shaping,
accumulations of material of the aforementioned type
is very difficult, since the wall thickness of the
extruded hose must be varied. The hose should be thick
where a large wall thickness, i.e. accumulation of material,
is desired, but thin where a small wall thickness
is desired.There are certainly various techniques for automatic
hose control during operation, but these techniques are
both complex and costly because the hose sections having
a large wall thickness must be cooled before the final
shaping of the article.According to an alternative method, which has been
put into practice, a thin-walled blank is produced in a 
first step, and is moved on to another moulding machine
where, in a second step, an accumulation of material is
applied by injection-moulding in the desired place on the
thin-walled blank. This method has been applied e.g. in
the making of infusion liquid containers whose filling
neck should have a connecting portion with accumulated
material, into which a rubber stopper is pressed and
which is sealed by an aluminium cap.This method is however slow and costly, in that it
comprises several operations which must be performed in
different machines. Besides, narrow tolerance requirements
are placed on the extruded blank, which are difficult
to comply with and which sometimes lead to considerable
scrapping.There is thus a need for a simpler and cheaper
method for providing accumulation of material on such
thin-walled, tubular plastic articles.One object of the present invention therefore is,
while

A method for producing a tubular article (1)
having a circumferential accumulation of material, in

relation to which the article has a thin wall, comprising
the steps:


that the tubular article (1) is formed with engagement
means (6) for cooperatively engaging corresponding

engagement means (8) formed on a separate, annular element
(5; 5a; 5b; 5c; 5d);
that the annular element is passed over the tubular
article (1) to the position where the accumulation of

material is to be provided; and
that the cooperating engagement means (6, 8) in
said position are brought into permanent engagement with

each other so as to prevent axial displacement of the
annular element and so as to provide the accumulation of

material from the annular element applied to the tubular
article (1) and from the adjoining wall of the tubular

article; 
characterised
 in
that the annular element (5; 5a; 5b; 5c; 5d) is
first expanded and then passed over the tubular article

(1); or that the tubular article is compressed before
passing the annular element over it.
A method for producing a tubular article (1)
having a circumferential accumulation of material, in

relation to which the article has a thin wall, in which
method the tubular article (1) is formed with engagement

means for cooperatively engaging corresponding engagement
means formed on a separate, annular element (5e; 5f),


characterised
 in

that the annular element (5e; 5f) is passed into
the tubular article (1) to the position where the accumulation

of material is to be provided; and
that the cooperating engagement means in said
position are brought into permanent engagement with each

other so as to prevent axial displacement of the annular 
element and so as to provide the accumulation of material

from the annular element applied to the tubular article
(1) and from the adjoining wall of the tubular article;

wherein the annular element (5e; 5f) is first compressed
and then inserted in the tubular article (1); or wherein

the tubular article is expanded before inserting the
annular element therein.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the annular
element (5; 5a; 5b; 5c; 5d) is applied on the outside

of a neck portion (3) of the article (1), which preferably
is a container or a bottle.
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the annular
element (5e; 5f) is applied on the inside of a neck

portion (3) of the article (1), which preferably is a
container or a bottle.
A device for carrying out the method as claimed
in any one of claim 1-4, 
characterised
 by a
tool for applying the annular element (5; 5a; 5b; 5c; 5d;

5e; 5f) outside or inside the tubular article (1), said
tool having means (7) for expanding either the annular

element or the tubular article, or for compressing either
the annular element or the tubular article, and for applying

the annular element on the article in the position
where the accumulation of material is to be provided,

thus establishing the engagement between the two cooperating
engagement means.
A device as claimed in claim 5, wherein said
means of the tool is an expanding mandrel (7).
