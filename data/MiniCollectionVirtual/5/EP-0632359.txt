<ABSTRACT>
Signal-controlled circuit arrangement for receiving and processing signal sequences between a computer-side data signal source and at least one peripheral-side data signal input, by means of which, when pauses in the signal sequences occur, the current consumption can be restricted to a predeterminable fraction of the full-load current consumption for the duration of a limitable period of time, by activating an electronically effective intervention into the mains power supply to a peripheral, having an independent apparatus unit, which can be inserted between the computer-side and peripheral-side data signal connections, and having a signal evaluation section, connected to the signal input(s), for the signals transmitted by the computer, and having one or more switching signal outputs to the switching signal circuit board for the mains current, and, furthermore, having a connection of the switching signal circuit board to one or more mains outputs and cable plug connections to the peripheral(s) to be switched.
