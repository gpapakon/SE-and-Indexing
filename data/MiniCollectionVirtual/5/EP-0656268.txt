<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for detecting a decrease 
of the air pressure in a tire for a four-wheel vehicle. 

Letting the rotational angular velocities of four tires 
are F1, F2, F3, F4, ajudgement value dF is expressed by 

the following equation (A): 

dF= (F1 + F4)/(F2 + F3) 
 
. 

The judgement value dF is a ratio of the sum (F1 + F4) 
of the rotational angular velocities of one pair of tires on 

a diagonal to that (F2 + F3) of the rotational angular velocities 
of the other pair. When the air pressures in the 

four tires are all normal, 

(F1 + F4) = (F2 + F3) 
 
, so that 

dF= 1. When the pressure in any one of the tires decreases, 
dF â‰  1. Therefore, when the judgement value is 

compared with a predetermined value, a decrease in the 
air pressure in a tire is detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to detection of a
tire pressure drop for a four-wheel vehicle, and more
particularly, to a device for and a method of detecting a tire
whose pneumatic pressure drops on the basis of the speeds of
rotation of four tires.As one of safety devices for a four-wheel vehicle such as
an automobile or a truck, tire pressure drop detecting devices
have been invented, and some of them have been put to
practical use. There is a great request to detect a tire
pressure drop for a vehicle particularly in Europe. The
reason for this is that in European countries where
expressways are developed, a tire pressure drop of a vehicle
which is traveling at high speed is liable to cause a large
accident.Examples of the conventional tire pressure drop detecting
devices which have been put to practical use include one for
directly measuring tire pressures. In this conventional
device, pressure sensors are respectively provided in tires,
and the pneumatic pressures of the tires are directly measured
by the pressure sensors. The measured tire pressures are
applied to a processing device provided on the side of the 
body of a vehicle. The pressure sensors and the processing
device are coupled to each other, for example,
electromagnetically, thereby making it possible to
mechanically send and receive signals in a non-contact state.
The tire pressures processed by the processing device are
displayed on a display or the like.The device so constructed that pressure sensors are
provided in the tires has the disadvantage of being very high
in cost. In addition, it also has the disadvantage in that
errors are liable to occur at the time of signal transmission,
although signals are electromagnetically transmitted to the
processing device provided on the side of the body of the
vehicle from the pressure sensors provided in the tires.
Particularly, the vehicle may, in some cases, travel under bad
conditions, for example, on a road having a lot of earth
magnetism, thus causing many barriers against electromagnetic
signal transmission.Therefore, as another conventional example, a tire
pressure drop detecting method for detecting the rotational
angular velocities of four tires and detecting a tire whose
pneumatic pressure relatively drops on the basis of the
rotational angular velocities of the respective tires has been
proposed (see Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 63-305011,
for example).In this conventional detecting method, the sum of the 
rotational angular velocities of a pair of tires on
