<ABSTRACT>
A composition suitable for use as a binder of 
ceramic materials and a method for preparing a ceramic 

material which provides relatively greater green ceramic 
strength is disclosed. The improved binder contains a 

substantially hydrolyzed copolymer made from monomers 
having ester or amide functional groups, poly(vinyl amine), 

poly(vinyl formamide) or a copolymer of vinyl alcohol and vinyl 
amine. The binder is combined with an aqueous solution 

containing a ceramic powder to make a slurry, and the slurry is 
subsequently spray dried, pressed and heated to make a 

ceramic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing a ceramic material by using
specific polymers and to the use of these specific polymers as a binder for
ceramic materials.Ceramic materials are commonly prepared by mixing powdered ceramic oxides
such as magnesia, alumina, titania and zirconia, in a slurry along with additives,
such as dispersants and binders. The slurry may be spray dried to produce
ceramic particles. The particles are pressed into an aggregate structure,
called a "green ceramic", having a desired shape and subsequently subjected
to a severe heat treatment known as sintering. The sintering process converts
the green ceramic into a cohesive "fired ceramic", having a nearly monolithic
polycrystalline ceramic phase. The binder serves to hold the ceramic particles of the green ceramic in the
desired shape after pressing. The binder can also provide lubrication while the
particles are pressed. Preferably, the binder combusts or vaporizes completely
during the sintering process leaving no trace of the binder in the fired ceramic
material. In performing these functions, binders significantly affect the properties
of the fired ceramics which are ultimately produced.In commercial practice, poly(vinyl alcohols) are widely used as ceramic binders.
Additionally, poly(ethylene oxide) and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers
reportedly have been used as binders for particulate material, such as granular
silica gel.EP-A-0 220 491 discloses a water-soluble binder for molding ceramics said
binder being composed of a polyvinyl alcohol-based copolymer containing 20
to 90 mol% of vinyl alcohol units and for the rest (meth)allyl group-containing
non ionic monomer units or nitrogeneous group-containing nonionic monomer
units.Although commercially available binders are satisfactory for many applications,
a need exists for improved binders which provide still greater strength in green
ceramic materials. Greater green strength reduces breakage during handling
of the green ceramics and, generally, is associated with higher quality fired
ceramics. Preferably, the improved binders should be cheaper and more versatile
than previously known binders.Therefore, the object of the present invention is to find an improved binder for
ceramic materials.Surprisingly, it has been found that specific polymers as defined below can be
used as an improved binder for ceramic materials.Although in DE-A-35 34 273 and DE-A-20 60 463 N-vinylamine units containing
hydrolyzed polymers are already disclosed, however, these known polymers
