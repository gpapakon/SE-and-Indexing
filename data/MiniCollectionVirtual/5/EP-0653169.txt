<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an edible composition, specifically to a nut spread 
which is equivalent in its sensory properties to the normal nut spread. The spread 

of the present invention however contains no sugar and considerably less fat. 
The present invention further relates to a method for obtaining the sugarless nut 

spread.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an edible composition, in particular to an edible confectionary
composition in which the ingredients are so chosen as to produce a composition having fewer
calories than the equivalent conventional product.There is at the present time an increasing public demand for low calorie products in the
interests of maintaining a healthier life style. In particular there is a demand for lower calorie
replacements of well established products having a relatively high calorie content. The problem for
the manufacturer however is how to produce such a lower calorie product having the same taste
and sensory properties as the product it is intended to replace given that such properties are usually
conferred by the fat and sugar content of the product. On a weight for weight basis sugar (sucrose)
has a lower calorie content than fat and of the two it is probably easier to find a satisfactory
replacement for sugar but it is particularly difficult to replace both sugar and fat in the same
composition without detracting significantly from the properties of the latter, especially with
respect to the mouth-feel.One popular edible composition is the type of confectionary composition which contains
sugar, fat and nuts usually in finely ground form and which is sufficiently soft to be spreadable.
Such a composition frequently contains cocoa powder to give a chocolate-flavoured
nut spread
which depends for its flavour and texture on the sugar/nut/fat content and on the relative proportion
of these three ingredients. After a prolonged investigation we have now devised a composition
which is equivalent in its sensory properties to this type of nut spread but which contains no sugar
and considerably less fat and has therefore significantly fewer calories than the conventional nut
spread.The edible compositions according to the present invention achieve their sweetness by use
of a maltitol-containing sugar alcohol syrup while the fat element is reduced by using a
combination of substances comprising maltodextrin and a small amount of vegetable fat and,
optionally but preferably, a proteinaceous substance. This combination gives mouth-feel
and
sensory properties akin to the conventional higher calorie product. Accordingly, the invention comprises an edible composition of the nut spread type
comprising the following constituents:
30 to 60 %of the composition of a sugar alcohol syrup containing maltitol in an amount
between 50 and 90 % of the syrup,5 to 20 %of the composition of finely ground edible
