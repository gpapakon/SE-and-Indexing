<ABSTRACT>
An analytical device for determining the presence and/or 
concentration of an analyte in a sample liquid comprises a 

hollow casing; means such as an assay strip within said 
casing for selectively capturing an analyte in sample 

liquid applied to the device; a bibulous sample liquid 
receiving member at or adjacent to a first extremity of 

said casing which collects sample liquid and transports it 
into the casing; a window in the casing at a location 

remote from the first extremity of the casing; and a single 
cap which can be applied in turn over the window during 

sample collection, and then over the sample receiving 
member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the construction and use of
analytical devices, especially those adapted for use by
relatively unskilled persons for example in the home.Home-use devices for the analysis of urine, for example in
pregnancy tests and ovulation prediction tests, are now
widely available commercially. Many such devices are based
on the principles of immunochromatography, and typically
comprise a hollow casing constructed of plastics material
containing a porous assay strip carrying pre-dosed reagents.
The user merely needs to apply a urine sample to one part of
the casing to initiate the assay. The assay result becomes
visible by eye within a few minutes without further action
by the user. Examples of such devices are described in EP-A-291194
and EP-A-383619.Sample collection is conveniently achieved by means of a
bibulous member which forms part of the device and which can
readily take up sample liquid, e.g. from a urine stream.
Optionally the bibulous member can protrude from the casing
of the device to facilitate sample application. In any
event, the bibulous member is normally located at or near an
extremity of the device so that the bibulous member can be
introduced into a source of sample liquid, such as a urine
stream, while minimising the likelihood of direct contact
between the sample liquid and the hands of the user. Devices
of this type are sometimes supplied with a cap which the
user can place over the bibulous member after sample
application. The benefits of the cap are primarily hygienic.In order to reveal the assay result, the casing of the
device has one or more apertures or windows through which
the interior of the device can be observed. At the very 
least, the efficiency of the device is impaired if sample
liquid enters the device though such observation windows.
Desirably the only route of access by the sample liquid into
the interior of the device is via the bibulous receiving
member. In an attempt to minimise the risk of ingress of
sample liquid through such observation windows, several
commercial devices incorporate transparent sheet material
located against the interior or exterior of the window, to
act as a seal.At the present time, commercially-available home-use
diagnostic devices generally provide the assay result in
qualitative or semi-quantitative terms only. For example, a
pregnancy test only needs to give a "yes/no" result.
However, there is a desire to adapt the home-use technology
to more sophisticated uses. An example is in the monitoring
of the human ovulation

<CLAIMS>
An analytical device for determining the presence
and/or concentration of an analyte in a sample liquid,

comprising:

an elongate hollow casing (10);
means within said casing for selectively capturing said
analyte in sample liquid applied thereto;
a bibulous sample liquid receiving member (16) at or
adjacent to a first extremity of said casing, said

receiving member providing means for collecting sample
liquid and transporting collected sample liquid into said

casing;
window means (17) in said casing at a location remote from
said first extremity of said casing, said window means

enabling detection of said analyte to be effected from
outside said casing; and
a single cover means (15) to enclose said bibulous sample
receiving member and said window means but not both

simultaneously, characterised in that said cover means is
telescopically receivable over either end of said elongate

casing, and in that said cover means provides means for
hand-holding said device while either of said bibulous

sample receiving member and said window means are enclosed
thereby.
An analytical device according to claim 1,
characterised in that said window means is located in a

portion (14) of said casing which is cooperatively
engageable with means (41) for reading the result of the

analysis, said cooperatively engageable portion becoming
exposed when said cover means is released to expose said 

window means.
An analytical device according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterised in that said bibulous sample receiving member

protrudes from said casing.
A method of using an analytical device according to
any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that said

device is hand-held by means of said cover means enclosing
said window means, while said bibulous sample receiving

member is introduced into a source of sample liquid, such
as a urine stream, and thereafter said cover means is

released from said casing to expose said window means and
received onto the opposite end of said casing to enclose

said sample receiving member.
A method according to claim 4, characterised in that
following sample collection and enclosure of said bibulous

sample receiving member, said device is hand-held by means
of said cover means enclosing said bibulous sample

receiving member to facilitate presentation of said window
means to means for reading the result of said analysis.
In combination, an analytical device according to any
one of claims 1 to 3 together with reader means for reading

and interpreting the result of an assay conducted using the
analytical device, said reader means having receiving means

to receive said portion of said device exposed when said
cover means is released to expose said window means.
