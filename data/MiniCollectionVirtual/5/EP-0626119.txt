<ABSTRACT>
An electronic camera (20) operates with a small, portable computer (10) having a card interface (12, 22) of the type used for communicating with a removable memory card. The camera includes an image sensor for converting an image into an electrical signal, an A/D converter for converting the electrical signal into a digital signal, and a signal processor for interfacing the digital signal to the card interface (22), ordinarily a slot (16) receptacle, on the computer. By defining the interface to include a mechanical extender (24) that physically interconnects the camera to the card slot (16) on the computer, the camera and computer are linked in a high speed interface as a convenient, hand-held unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the field of
electronic imaging and, more particularly, to an
image acquisition peripheral operated as an input
device to a personal computer.It is well known to use a video camera with a
computer frame grabber. A typical system employs a
video motion camera (such as the CCD 4000 RGB Flash-Sync
Camera manufactured by Eastman Kodak Co.,
Rochester, N.Y.) and a frame grabber board (such as a
TARGA(TM) frame store board manufactured by True
Vision, Inc., Indianapolis, Indiana) attached to the PC
bus of a personal computer. The camera provides the
timing to interface with the video frame store board by
activating the frame acquire line of the frame store
board whenever an external voltage input to the camera
is dropped low (e.g., by dropping the "Camera Acquire
In" line to the CCD 4000 camera). It is customary to
design software to activate the camera's frame acquire
line from the computer. To capture an image into the
computer in such a customary application, the operator
frames the subject while observing the live camera
output on a video monitor, and then interacts with the
computer keyboard at the proper moment.Another approach to computer image
acquisition is described in U.S. Serial Number 805,220, (US5402170),
entitled "Hand-Manipulated Electronic Camera Tethered
to a Personal Computer," which was filed December 11,
1991 in the names of K. A. Parulski, R. H. Hamel, and
J. J. Acello, and assigned to the assignee of the
present application. In this system an electronic 
camera is coupled to a personal computer through a
computer interface. In particular, a digital interface
standard may be used, and images from the camera are
input to the computer through a Small Computer System
Interface (SCSI). The camera is preferably linked, or
tethered, to the computer with a cable, thus allowing a
certain amount of mobility for the camera independent
of the computer.Both of these known interfaces have drawbacks.
The NTSC signal is an analog signal subject to noise,
and additionally requires a special frame grabber card
in the computer to decode and digitize the signal. The
SCSI signal has a relatively low data rate and a
complicated protocol, requiring an expensive SCSI
interface integrated circuit in the camera.
Notwithstanding such drawbacks, the system described in
Serial Number 805,220 provides a low cost electronic
still camera which attaches to a personal computer that
provides image processing, storage, and display. By
relying on the computer to perform these tasks, the
camera
