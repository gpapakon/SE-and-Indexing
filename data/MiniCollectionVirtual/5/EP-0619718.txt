<ABSTRACT>
Closure devices (100, 200, 300) and methods of use for sealing a small, e.g., percutaneous, incisions or punctures (28). The closure device (100, 200, 300) may take many forms and basically comprises a somewhat elongated plug (102, 306) having a deformable distal end portion (108, 310) including a free end (112, 308) to which a thin retraction filament (104, 304) is connected. The closure device (100, 200, 300) is arranged to be introduced into the body of the being through the incision or puncture (28) by an introducer (122) so that the distal portion (108, 310) of the plug is located on one side of said tissue and its proximal portion (110, 312) is located on the other side of that tissue, with the filament (104, 304) extending through the incision or puncture. The filament (104, 304) is arranged to be grasped and pulled in the proximal direction to deform the distal portion (108, 310) of the plug so that it cannot pass back through the incision or puncture (28), whereupon the puncture or incision is sealed by the deformed distal portion (108, 310) of the plug (100, 200, 300). The distal portion (108, 310) of the plug (100, 200, 300) is non-hemostatic so that when the closure (100, 200, 300) is used to seal an incision or puncture (28) in a blood vessel (24) it will not produce any blood clots within the vessel (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to medical devices and more specifically to devices
for sealing percutaneous openings or incisions in the body of a living being.In United States patents 4,744,364 and 4,852,568,
from which the first document is used as basis for the preamble of independent claims
1 and 12,
there is disclosed a device for
sealing an incision or puncture in tissue separating one portion of the body of a
living being from another portion, e.g. a puncture in a blood vessel, duct or lumen,
of a living being. The device basically comprises an elongated tubular body having
an outlet at its distal end. The distal end of the device is arranged to be inserted,
such as percutaneously, through the puncture. In the case where the puncture is
an artery or other blood vessel, the outlet is inserted through the puncture so that it
is located within the blood vessel's interior. An expandable closure is disposed
within the device's tubular body and is formed so that it is held in a compact or
compressed configuration within the tubular body. The tubular body also includes
an ejector in the form of a plunger-like member arranged to force the closure out of
the outlet into the portion of the being's body contiguous with the opening, e.g.
within the interior of the blood vessel, whereupon the closure automatically expands
to form an enlarged tissue engagement surface.A retraction filament is secured to the closure to enable it to be pulled fully into the
puncture after the device's tubular body has been withdrawn so that the
engagement surface of the closure intimately engages the inner surface of the
tissue contiguous with the puncture. When the closure is used for sealing punctures or incisions in blood vessels it is
constructed so that when it is open (i.e., in its expanded state) and in place sealing
the puncture it doesn't appreciably block the flow of blood through the blood vessel.In international application WO 89/11301 there is disclosed another device for
sealing a similar puncture or incision. The device basically comprises a closure or
plug formed of a material which when located within the puncture or incision
expands automatically to engage the tissue contiguous therewith to seal the
puncture and incision from the flow of body fluid therethrough. The closure
disclosed in that application basically comprises a holding member, a filament, and
a sealing member. The holding member is an elongated body, constructed like a
toggle, and preferably formed of a biodegradable, thermoplastic polymer, such

internal portion thereof to prevent the flow of bodily fluid therebetween, said
incision or puncture (28) comprising a track portion extending through said

first internal portion, said closure device comprising plug means (102) and
retraction means (104),

 the plug means (102)
comprises a generally elongated member having a central longitudinal axis,

a distal portion (108) and a proximal portion (110), the distal portion (108) of

a second portion, the first portion being secured to the elongate member

adjacent the free end (112) thereof and laterally of said central longitudinal
axis, the first portion of the filament (104) extending laterally of the central

longitudinal axis of the elongated member along a first part of the distal
portion of the elongated member for a portion of the length of the elongated

member, to an intermediate portion, the second portion of the filament
(104) extending along a second part of the elongated member and closer to

the central longitudinal axis of the elongated member than the first portion of
the filament (104), the second portion of the filament (104) extending

between the intermediate portion and the proximal end of the elongated
member and then out of the proximal portion of the elongated member, the

distal portion of the elongated member being deformable so that when the
filament (104) is pulled, the free end (112) of the elongated member is pulled

toward the intermediate portion, thereby deforming the distal portion
