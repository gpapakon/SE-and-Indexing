<ABSTRACT>
Designed to improve the quality of the float finish on a partially hardened cement floor, especially along the border areas adjacent to walls, the machine comprises a rotor, embodied as a disk (1) supporting a set of trowel blades (2) accommodated in corresponding radial slots (27) and angularly adjustable, an engine (11) and a speed reducer (5) the output shaft (4) of which carries a sliding collar (21) with a projecting flange (22) positioned to bear on the ends of a set of crank levers (23) keyed to the innermost ends of the shafts which carry the trowel blades (2); the machine also comprises an idle spacing element (24) the hub (24a) of which is coupled rotatably with the outer surface of the sliding collar, and with a coaxial sleeve (19) affording a projecting flange (18) engaged by the forked end members of a rocking lever (17), the remaining end of which is attached to an adjustable rod (15). The machine can be used to float finish concrete and cement floors laid in premises of any given description.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a machine for floating floors, that 
is to say, an assemblage of devices by means of which to 
effect an automatic smoothing action on extensive flat 
surfaces consisting in a layer of concrete or mortar, not 
yet fully dried; once hardened, such surfaces will provide 
floors in premises destined for industrial or commercial 
activity, for example, or in public or private buildings 
generally. The prior of art comprises float finish machines 
comprising a rotor, or a pair of rotors each equipped with 
a set of adjustable radial trowel blades cantilevered from 
a crosswise supporting member driven in rotation about 
its own vertical axis by an engine and speed reducer. The German document DE-A-2 502 902, for instance, 
discloses a float finish machine for floating floors, 
comprising a rotor consisting of a disk, disposed 
sustantially parallel to the floor, the disc being 
provided with radial slots each accommodating a trowel 
blade, each trowel blade being angularly adjustable about 
an axis disposed sustantially parallel to the floor, the 
disc being coupled with a shaft having its axis disposed 
substantially perpendicular to the floor. This document 
forms the basis for the preamble of the independent claim. One notable problem experienced with such machines is that 
of finishing the areas of the floor adjacent to the walls; 
this is due principally to the large outer diameter of the 
rotors, typically around one metre and even more, which 
dictates that the crosswise supporting member must 
maintain a stable horizontal position in order to ensure 
that its radial arms are protected from damaging 
vibrations and excessive shock loads. Such machines are 
therefore unsuitable for finishing the border areas of 
floors, albeit only slightly uneven or sloping, with the 
result that recourse must be made to the more costly 
operation of floating by hand.  
 It often happens, moreover, particularly with single rotor 
machines, that in an attempt to finish the border areas of 
a floor exhibiting a shallow depression, the operator will 
attempt to tilt the vertical axis of the rotor toward the 
wall; this results in excessive stress being placed on the 
arms of the crosswise supporting member and uneven wear on 
the mechanical components of the machine, not to mention 
damage to the areas of the wall against which the frame of 
the machine is caused to chafe. The prior art thus stands in need of considerable 
improvement, in view of a possible elimination of the 
drawbacks mentioned

<CLAIMS>
A float finish machine for floating floors, comprising 
a rotor consisting of a disk (1), disposed substantially 

parallel to the floor, the disk being provided with radial 
slots (27) each accomodating a trowel blade (2), each 

trowel blade (2) being angularly adjustable about an axis 
disposed substantially parallel to the floor, the disk (1) 

being coupled with a shaft (4) having its axis disposed 
substantially perpendicular to the floor, 
characterized
in
that
 
an idle spacing element (24) having an outer diameter 

greater than the outer diameter of the disk (1) is 
disposed on the shaft (4), said idle spacing element being 

free to rotate with respect to the shaft (4).  
 
A machine as in claim 1, wherein each blade (2) is 
fixed to the flat bottom face (23c) of a respective shaft 

(23b) disposed substantially parallel to the floor, said 
shaft having each end (23a, 30) rotatably supported by the 

disk (1) at an intermediate position on the shorter sides 
of the slot (27). 
A machine as in claim 1, or 2, wherein the shaft (4) is 
provided with driving means and with a sliding collar (21) 

disposed with an annular projection (22). 
A machine as in claim 3, wherein said sliding collar 
(21) is rotatably coupled with said idle spacing element 

(24). 
A machine as in claim 4, wherein said idle spacing 
element is provided with a hub (24a) ensheathed by a 

sleeve (19) capable of axial movement as one with the 
sliding collar (21) while rotatable in relation thereto. 
A machine as in claim 5, wherein said sleeve (19) 
affords an annular projection (18) co-operating with a 

device (14) for setting the angular position of the trowel 
blades (2). 
A machine as in claim 6, wherein said device (14) for 
setting the angular position of the trowel blades (2) 

comprises a forked oscillating lever (17) engaging said 
annular projection (18), said forked oscillating lever

element (36) but less than the diameter of the catch pin 

element, said first strech being followed in the direction 
of rotation of the disk (1) by a second stretch (39)
