<ABSTRACT>
An element (1) for a motor vehicle lighting or signalling device is characterised in that it consists at least partially of a transparent plastic loaded with light-reflecting particles (4). Such an element can be applied for producing headlamp lenses with opaque zones forming ornaments, independent ornaments, lamps for signalling lights or flux recoverers for signalling lights.

Element (1; 7; 10; 11) for a motor vehicle lighting or 
signalling device, characterised in that it consists at least 

partially of a transparent plastic material loaded with light-reflecting 
particles. 
Element according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
light-reflecting particles consist of flakes of shiny opaque 

metal with a neutral colour. 
Element according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
shiny opaque metal with a neutral colour is aluminium. 
Element according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that it constitutes a headlamp cover (1) and in that at 

least part (4; 3; 6) of a peripheral area of the cover, 
through which the headlamp beam does not pass, consists of 

transparent plastic material loaded with light-reflecting 
particles, the remainder of the cover consisting of non-loaded 

transparent plastic material. 
Element according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
said part of the peripheral area of the cover consists of an 

upward extension (4) of the cover for connection with adjacent 
bodywork. 
Element according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
said part of the peripheral area of the cover consists of a 

turned-in part which forms a cover base (3). 
Element according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
said part of the peripheral area of the cover consists of a 

turned-in skirt (6) extending inside a cover base and defining 
with the latter a peripheral space suitable for receiving a 

front edge of a reflector, the said turned-in skirt forming an  
 

intermediate mask between the cover and reflector. 
Element according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the said part (5) of the peripheral region of the 

cover is superimposed on a cover base (3). 
Element according to Claim 8, characterised in that the 
said part (5) of the peripheral region of the cover is 

situated on the inner side of the cover base. 
Element according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that it includes the same plastic material for the loaded 

and non-loaded parts. 
Element according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that it constitutes an intermediate masking element (7) for 

a headlamp, extending between a front edge of a mirror of the 
headlamp and a cover (1) of the headlamp and distinct from the 

mirror and cover. 
Element according to Claim 11, characterised in that it 
is produced entirely from transparent plastic material loaded 

with reflecting particles. 
Element according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that it constitutes a glass (10) for at least 

one indicator lamp, in that it has a low density of reflecting 
particles in an area (9) of the glass forming the illuminating 

surface of the lamp or lamps, and in that it has a high 
density of particles in an area (8) of the glass which does 

not form an illuminating surface. 
Element according to Claim 13, for a plurality of 
indicator lamps each having a cavity and separated by 

partitions, characterised in that it has a high density of 
particles in an area (8) of the glass situated at the 

transition between two adjacent illuminating surfaces.  
 
Element according to Claim 13 or 14, characterised in 
that the transparent plastic material is coloured. 
Element according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that it constitutes a reflector (11) for an 

indicator lamp with a high angular emission range. 
Motor vehicle headlamp, characterised in that it 
incorporates as a cover an element according to one of Claims 

4 to 10. 
Motor vehicle headlamp, characterised in that it 
incorporates, as a masking element, an element according to 

Claim 11 or 12. 
Indicator lamp for a motor vehicle, characterised in that 
it incorporates, as a glass, an element according to one of 

Claims 13 to 15. 
Indicator lamp for a motor vehicle, characterised in that 
it incorporates, as a reflector, an element according to Claim 

16.
