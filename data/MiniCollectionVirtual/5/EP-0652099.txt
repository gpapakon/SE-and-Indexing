<ABSTRACT>
A method for the manufacturing of sun visors, according to which a hollow main visor part (1a) of a sun visor is manufactured by a single moulding operation, to be precise by compression blowmoulding; the moulding operation involved has in each case individual phases, in the course of which two sheets (33) (34) of a plastics material are laid between a pair of mould halves (28) (29) of a compression mould (26), serving for moulding, there being laid between each sheet (33) (34) and the corresponding mould half (28) (29) in each case a corresponding film (37) of a coating material, and the mould halves (28) (29) then being closed and a stream of pressurised fluid being blown between the sheets (33) (34), so that the deforming and bonding of the sheets (33) (34) to each other is achieved simultaneously and, at the same time, the applying of each of the films (37), serving for coating, to the corresponding sheet (33) (34) is achieved by simple compression.
