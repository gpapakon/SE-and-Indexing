<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is cancer-specific
antigens.Individuals with cancer frequently exhibit
elevated levels of circulating antigens which are
associated with that cancer. Such is the case in women
with breast carcinoma. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) was
prepared against a membrane-enriched extract of a human
breast carcinoma metastatic to liver (Kufe et al., 1984,
Hybridoma 3:223-232). The antibody was specific for what
was termed DF3 antigen, a human breast carcinoma-associated
antigen that is a collection of closely
related, high molecular weight glycoproteins having the
common property that they react with anti-DF3 antibodies.
DF3 antigen is also described in U.S. Patent No.
4,963,484.DF3 antigen is detectable on the apical
borders of normal secretory mammary epithelial cells and
in the cytosol of less differentiated malignant breast
cells (Kufe et al., 1984, Hybridoma 3:223-232). This
apical and cytoplasmic staining pattern has also been
described for MAbs prepared against human milk fat
globule membranes (HMFGM) and breast carcinoma cell lines
(Arklie et al., 1981, Int. J. Cancer 28:23-29; Hilkens et
al., 1984, Int. J. Cancer 34:197-206; Sloane et al.,
1981, Cancer 47:1786-1795; Croghan et al., 1983, Cancer
Res. 43:4980-4988). Because DF3 antigen is detectable at
elevated levels in the plasma of women with metastatic 
breast cancer, it has been used to monitor clinical
course (Hayes et al., 1986, J. Clin. Oncol. 4:1542-1550;
Tondini et al., 1988, Cancer Res. 48:4107-4122; Perey et
al., 1990, Br. J. Cancer 62:668-670). Expression of this
antigen has also been correlated with the degree of
breast tumor differentiation and estrogen receptor status
(Lundy et at, 1985, Br. Cancer Res. Treat. 5:269-276).The finding that expression of DF3 in breast
carcinoma cells and human milk is heterogenous suggested
the possibility of a genetic polymorphism (Sekine et al.,
1985, J. Immunol. 135:3610; Hilkens et al., 1989, Cancer
Res. 49:786; Karlsson et al., 1983, Ann. Hum. Genet.
47:263). Indeed, studies in family members demonstrated
that the electrophoretic heterogeneity of DF3 antigen is
determined by codominant expression of multiple alleles
at a single locus (Hayes et al., 1988, Blood 71:436).
Sequence analysis of cDNA clones coding for this protein
revealed highly conserved (G+C)-rich 60 base-pair tandem
repeats (Swallow et al., 1987, Nature 328:82; Siddiqui et
al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2320; Gendler et
al., 1988, J. Biol. Chem. 263:12820). These repeats code
for epitopes recognized by MAb
