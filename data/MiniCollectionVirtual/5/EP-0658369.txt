<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
purification of an exhaust gas, particularly an exhaust 
gas from diesel engines and an apparatus for 
purification of an exhaust gas. Unburnt particulate substances in an exhaust 
gas from diesel engines, for example, solid carbon fine 
particles, liquid or solid high molecular weight hydrocarbon 
fine particles and the like (hereinafter referred 
to as "particulates") mostly have a particle size of 
smaller than 1 micron and are apt to float in the atmosphere 
and to be breathed into human bodies. Furthermore, 
since they contain carcinogenic substances, 
especially recently many problems are taken up in Japan 
and abroad and it is supposed that control of exhaustion 
be further tightened in the future. Diesel exhaust gases contain NOx which is a 
harmful substance, in addition to the above-mentioned 
particulates and this substance is also regulated on its 
exhaustion. Production of NOx and the particulates are 
in the relation of trade-off, and there is the tendency 
that when a measure is taken to diminish emission of 
NOx, emission of particulates increases. Therefore, it 
is difficult to diminish both the NOx and the particulates 
only by the improvement of the operating system of  
 
engines, and removal of the particulates is carried out 
by physical trapping of them by a particulate trap 
provided in an exhaust gas line. However, when the trap 
is used for a long time, the trap is clogged with 
deposited particulates to result in pressure loss. 
Under the circumstance, as a promising method, it has 
been studied to periodically burn the trapped particulates 
and regenerate the trap. The particulates contained in diesel exhaust 
gases comprise liquid or solid high molecular weight 
fine particles of a relatively low ignition temperature 
and solid carbon fine particles of a relatively high 
ignition temperature, and since the proportion of them 
varies depending on exhausting conditions (kinds of 
engines, operating modes, etc.), the ignition temperature 
of the particulates differs and, moreover, the 
ignition temperature of the solid carbon fine particles 
and liquid or solid high molecular hydrocarbon fine 
particles per se also differs depending on the exhausting 
conditions. However, in general, in order to burn 
and remove the particulates trapped in the trap to 
inhibit the pressure loss in the exhaust gas line, the 
trap and the trapped particulates must be heated to a 
high temperature (600-700°C) and this brings about the 
following
