<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a construction related to the 
supply pipe (S₁) for pulp in the headbox of a paper 

machine, by means of which construction any movements 
taking place during tilting of the headbox are 

compensated for and transfer of strains to the stationary 
supply pipe (S₂) is prevented. The movement 

compensator (10) comprises a first pipe (11), 
which is connected to the supply pipe (S₁) by means 

of a connecting flange (12) that permits rotation, and 
a second pipe (13), which is connected to the first 

pipe by means of a connecting flange (14) that permits 
rotation and which second pipe is further connected 

to the stationary supply pipe (S₂) by means of 
a connecting flange (15) that permits rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a construction related to a supply pipe arrangement for pulp at 
the inlet header of a tiltable headbox of a paper machine, more specifically 
an arrangement according to the preamble of claim 1, which is based on CH-A-393 068. When the headbox of a paper machine is being tilted, the supply pipe is provided 
with means of equipment that permit rotation of the supply pipe. It has been known 
from prior art to manufacture at least a portion of the supply pipe out of an elastic 
material which permits rotation of the supply pipe while the opposite end of the 
elastic construction remains stationary. A drawback of said construction is the poor 
strength of the material. During tilting of the headbox, the end connected with the 
headbox has moved along a relatively wide path while the opposite end of the supply 
pipe has remained stationary. The material is subjected to a high torsional strain, as 
a result of which the service life of the pipe has become limited. This problem has been solved by the characterizing features of claim 1. Preferred embodiments are defined in claims 2-7. Thus, according to the invention, it has been realized to form a joint construction that 
permits a tilting movement of the headbox, i.e. a movement compensator, in the 
pulp supply pipe of the headbox, which joint construction comprises a first pipe, 
which is linked and placed in an oblique angle in relation to the header so that it 
permits rotation. In the construction, the first pipe of the movement compensator is 
connected with a second pipe, which is installed at an oblique angle in relation to the 
first pipe of the movement compensator. The first pipe of the compensator is linked by means of a flange joint that permits 
rotation in relation to the feed pipe and, in a corresponding way, the first pipe is 
linked by means of a similar flange joint that permits rotation in relation to the 
second pipe of the compensator. In a corresponding way, the second pipe of the  
 
compensator is linked by means of a flange joint so that it can rotate in relation to the 
pulp supply pipe placed in a stationary position. When the headbox of the paper machine is pivoted around the pivot shaft, the 
movement compensator in accordance with the invention permits said pivoting. The 
mechanism in accordance with the invention, which is a sort of an articulated crank 
mechanism, permits shifting of the headbox both in the y-direction and in the z-direction 
(FIG. 1). Thus, pivoting of the headbox produces no strains in

and a second pipe (13), which is connected to said 

first pipe (11) by means of a connecting flange (14) that 
permits rotation of the second pipe (13) with respect to the first pipe (11) and 

which second pipe is further connected to said stationary end 
pipe (S
2
) by means of a connecting flange (15) that permits 
rotation of the second pipe (13) with respect to the 

stationary end pipe (S

). 
Supply pipe arrangements as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the first pipe 
(11) is installed at an oblique angle in relation to the central axis (X') of said one end 

pipe (S
