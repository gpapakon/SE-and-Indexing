<ABSTRACT>
Backpack (rucksack) (1) designed for carrying a pair of skis (20, 21) attached together, of the type comprising a back (2), a carrying harness with straps (3, 4) and a sack proper (5) with a bottom (7), a front face (6) opposite the back (2) and a closure cover (8), and in which the bottom of the front face (6) of the sack has a looped strap arranged in the vicinity of the longitudinal plane of symmetry of the sack, characterised:   - in that the looped strap (10) has a developed length greater than twice the width of the skis (20, 21) and twice their thickness, so as to allow passage of the pair of skis, so that, during carrying, the rear of the heel (22, 23) of the safety binding of the skis bears against the said loop (10); - and in that the top of the sack has a means intended to enclose the pair of skis (20, 21) between the top (22, 23) of the heel of the safety binding and the tip (26, 27).

Backpack (1) arranged for carrying a pair of
skis (20, 21) fastened together, of the type comprising

a back (2), a carrying harness with straps (3, 4) and
the pack (5) itself with a bottom (7), a front face (6)

opposite the back (2) and a closure flap (8), and in
which the top of the pack comprises, at the level of

the flap (8), a first belt (31) fixed to one of the
sides of the top (30) of the pack (2) and intended to

interact with a second belt (33) arranged symmetrically
on the other side of the top (30) of the pack in

relation to the plane of longitudinal symmetry of this
pack, the end of the two belts having rapid-fastening

means (32, 34) so as to form a horizontal loop intended
to surround the top of the pair of skis between the

front of the binding (28, 29) and the tip (26, 27),
characterized in that the bottom of the front face (6)

of the pack has another belt in the form of a loop (10)
arranged in proximity to the plane of longitudinal

symmetry of the pack, said belt (10) having a developed
length greater than twice the width of the skis (20,

21) and than twice their thickness so as to allow
passage of the pair of skis, so that, during carrying,

the rear of the safety binding heelpiece (22, 23) of
the skis comes to rest against said loop (10).
Backpack according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the belts (10, 31, 33) are made of braided textile

material. 
Backpack according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the belts (31, 33) are elastic.
Backpack according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the belts (31, 33) are

retractable.
Backpack according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the two upper belts (31, 33) are fixed to the top

(30) of the back (2) at the level of the upper end of
the straps (3, 4).
Backpack according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the rapid-fastening system of the upper horizontal

loop is formed by an assembly comprising a male part
(32) with elastic fingers snapping into a female part

(34).
Backpack according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the length of the free belt (35) associated with

the male part (32) is length-adjustable and exceeds the
length of the portion (31) of the same belt fixed to

the top (3) of the pack.
Backpack according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the belt in the form of a loop (10) is associated

with another belt (50) arranged between the middle of
the bottom (51) of the front face (6) and the middle

(52) of the loop (10).
