 A COMBINATION OF NEUROTROPHIN AND ANTIBODY DIRECTEDTOWARD MYELIN-ASSOCIATED NEURITE GROWTH INHIBITORYPROTEIN PROMOTES CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM REGENERATION1- INTRODUCTION The present invention relates to methods of promoting central nervous system regeneration in a subject in need of such treatment comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an essentially purified and isolated neurotrophin family member together with an antibody directed toward a myelin-associated neurite growth inhibitory protein.2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONCell attachment, cell spreading, cell motility, and, in particular, neurite outgrowth are strongly dependent on cell-substrate interactions (Sanes, 1983, Ann. Rev. Physiol. .4_5:581-600; Carbonetto et al., 1987, J. Neurosci. 2-610-620). An increasing number of substrate molecules favoring neuroblast migration or neurite outgrowth have been found in central and peripheral nervous tissue (Cornbrooks et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 8O:3850-3854; Edelman, 1984, Exp. Cell Res. 161:1-16: Liesi, 1985, EMBO J. 4.:1163-1170; Chiu, A.Y. et al., 1986, J. Cell Biol. Ij03_:1383-1398; Fischer et al., 1986, J. Neurosci. 6 x605-612; Lindner et al., 1986, Brain Res. 377:298- 304; Mirsky et al., 1986, J. Neurocytol. 15:799-815; Stallcup et al., 1986, J. Neurosci. 5:1090-1101; Carbonetto et al., 1987, J. Neurosci. 2*610-620). The appearance of some of these factors can be correlated with specific developmental stages, and, in the periÂ¬ pheral nervous system (PNS) , also with denervation (Edelman, 1984, Exp. Cell Res. 161:1-16; Liesi, 1985, EMBO J. 4.:1163-1170; Stallcup et al., 1985, J. Neurosci. 5_:109-1101; Daniloff et al., 1986, J. Cell 

Biol. 103:929-945: Carbonetto et al., 1987, J. Neurosci. 2:610-620).However, the differentiated central nervous system (CNS) of higher vertebrates is capable of only very limited regenerative neurite growth after lesions. Limited regeneration after lesion has been seen in the retina (McConnell and Berry, 1982, Brain Res. 241:362-365) and in aminergic unmyelinated fiber tracts after chemical (Bjorklund and Stenevi, 1979, Physiol. Rev. 59:62-95) but not mechanical lesions (Bregman, 1987, Dev. Brain Res. 34:265-279). Neurite growth from implanted embryonic CNS tissues in adult rat CNS has been found in some cases to reach up to 14 mm within some gray matter areas, but has not been found to exceed 1 mm within white matter (Nornes et al., 1983, Cell Tissue Res. 230:15-35; Bjorklund and Stenevi, 1979, Physiol. Rev. 59:62-95; Commission,
