<ABSTRACT>
A liquid food product packaging process and apparatus is 
disclosed. The process may be employed for filling gable top 

cartons with high acid liquids such as orange juice. The 
product is heated to a sufficiently high temperature to 

sterilize the product for a short period of time and then 
cooled to an intermediate temperature that is sufficiently 

high to avoid the growth of bacteria, and at the intermediate 
temperature, the product is placed in unsealed gable top 

cartons. The cartons are sealed and allowed to cool to room 
temperature. This process produces a food package that has 

high seal integrity and relatively low carton distortion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes and apparatus for
packaging liquid food products such as fruit juices, in
paperboard cartons, and more specifically, to packaging
processes that provide a long shelf life for the liquid
product without refrigeration.It has been common practice to package dairy products and
fruit juices in gable top cartons which are constructed of a
laminate having a paperboard substrate that is coated on both
sides with a thermoplastic material, such as polyethylene. In
order to prevent the migration of oxygen into the interior of
the package, the laminate may include a barrier layer of
aluminum foil or other suitable material between the substrate
and the polyethylene liquid contact layer. The carton is
formed from a carton blank into the proper shape and then the
bottom seams are bonded together by heat sealing. During the
filling operation, the juice or other liquid product is
introduced into the carton through the open top. The carton
is not completely filled, so that when the top is closed,
there is a space above the liquid which is referred to as the
headspace. The top of the carton is closed by folding
opposite side walls at the center toward each other, while
moving the other two side walls toward each other to form the
top which resembles a roof gable. The top edges of all four
sides overlap each other at the top of the gable and are heat
sealed together under pressure. The headspace contains air or 
other gas that is trapped inside the carton when the gable top
is closed and sealed.Juice products, such orange juice, can be stored at room
temperature in these cartons for substantial periods of time
if microorganisms are excluded from the interior of the
carton, or are killed by conventional techniques, such as
heating, hydrogen peroxide treatment, or ultraviolet light
treatment. Form, fill and seal processes and apparatus, such
as the Tetra Brik system that is described, for example, in
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,384,438 and 4,464,156, have been used
successfully for packaging juice and liquid food products in
paper-coated cartons in which the liquid completely fills the
package. This system, however, is not suitable for packaging
liquid food products in gable top cartons.Various processes have been proposed for filling gable
top cartons with juice products under conditions which prolong
the shelf life of the product, but these processes have the
disadvantage of not producing a product having favorable
taste, vitamin C retention, color or filling characteristics.

<CLAIMS>
A process for packaging liquid food products in
preformed plastic coated paperboard, the cartons having

an open top through which they may be filled with liquid
food products after sterilizing the interior of the

carton, said process comprising the steps of sterilizing
the liquid food product by heating the product to a

temperature sufficient to render the product
commercially sterile; then cooling the product to a

lower temperature; filling the sterilized carton with
the liquid food product under aseptic conditions at said

lower temperature; closing and heat sealing the top
opening of the carton while the liquid food product is

at said lower temperature; and subsequently cooling the
packaged liquid food product to room temperature,

characterised in that said lower temperature is between
65°C and 72°C.
The process according to claim 1 wherein said
heating step raises the temperature of the liquid food

product to about 95°C for about 20 seconds.
The process according to claim 1 including
inverting the filled and sealed carton to allow the

liquid food product to contact the interior surfaces at
the top of the carton.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the
cooling of the product after sterilization occurs in

less than 60 seconds.
