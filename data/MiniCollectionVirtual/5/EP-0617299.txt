<ABSTRACT>
A light diffuser comprising a transparent 
body obtained by dispersing the polymer particles in a 

transparent polymer. The refractive index of the body substantially 
equal to that of the peripheral portion of the 

polymer particles. The particles have a gradient index structure, in 
order to get high diffusion but low reflection. The polymer particles 

are produced by using two different radical polymerizable 
monomer components whose respective polymers differ by 

0.005 or more in refractive index from each other, 
suspension polymerizing one (A) of said radical 

polymerizable monomers in an aqueous medium in the 
presence of an oil-soluble polymerization initiator, 

starting addition of the other radical polymerizable 
monomer component (B) while the conversion of said 

monomer component (A) is in the range of 70-95%, and 

cntinuing polymerization by adding said monomer 
component (B) substantially continuously without freshly 

supplying the polymerization initiator, the polymer 
particles and processes for producing them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a process of manufacture of polymer particles having a
refractive index distribution and to a process of manufacture of
a light
distributor. More particularly, it relates to the manufacture of a light
distributor controlled to allow distribution of light
only in the incident direction of light while greatly
reducing light distribution in the opposite direction.As techniques for affording light distributing
properties to a transparent material, a method is known
in which a light distributing agent comprising glass
particles, particles of a white pigment such as titanium
oxide, inorganic transparent crystal particles such as
calcium carbonate, transparent polymer particles or the
like are dispersed in an insular pattern in a transparent
material. The light distributors produced by
making use of such techniques have been applied to
various commercial products such as illuminant cover,
projection television screen, surface luminescent
devices showing uniform luminance, etc.Recently, from the standpoints of saving of
energy and high performance, request is rising for a
light distributor of the type capable of substantially
distributing light in the incident direction of light 
while inhibiting light distribution in the opposite
direction.Regarding such optically controlled light
distributors, there are known ones in which the
difference in refractive index between the light
distributing agent and the transparent base material and
the particle diameter of the light distributing agent
are defined in the specified ranges. For instance, JP-B-60-21662
discloses a light distributing resin produced
by dispersing in a transparent resin a powder of a
transparent material having refractive index which is
0.01-0.1 smaller than that of the transparent resin and
an average particle size of from 1 to 10 µm. JP-A-02-6557
discloses a light distributing plastic in which the
difference in refractive index between the light
distributing agent and the transparent plastic is 0.02-0.04
and the particle size of the light distributing
agent is 7-30 µm. Further, JP-A-63-205602 discloses a
light distributing plate specified by the effective and
non-effective projected areas which are decided by the
ratio in refractive index of the transparent resin to
the light distributing agent, particle size of the light
distributing agent and content thereof.There are also known light distributors
using a light distributing agent of a specific
composition. For instance, JP-B-01-53901 discloses a
light distributing
