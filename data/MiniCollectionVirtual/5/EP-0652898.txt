<ABSTRACT>
Methods are provided for detecting IDDM and pre-clinical IDDM by obtaining serum samples from a mammal and determining the level of antibodies to bovine serum albumin or a fragment thereof thereof by particle concentration fluoroimmunoassay employing particle-bound bovine serum albumin or fragments thereof as antigen. Novel peptides are provided for use in these methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS FOR DETECTING PRE-CLINICAL IDDMThis invention relates to methods for detecting autoimmune diseases and pre-clinical autoimmune diseases.In particular, it relates to methods for detecting insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and pre-clinical IDDM. Peptide fragments are provided for use in these methods.BackgroundEpidemiological evidence in man (1-4) and data from animal feeding studies (5-8) have suggested a diabetogenic effect of dietary cow milk proteins. Supportive serological findings have been identified in animals (5,9) and humans (10-12) associating immunity to cow's milk proteins and Type 1 diabetes. The most direct evidence for a pathogenic link between cow's milk proteins and diabetes comes from a family study in Finland, where exclusive breast-feeding for the first 3-4 months of life was found to protect from later development of diabetes (4) .Most of these studies did not identify a specific cow milk protein or explain the near global increase in diabetes incidence despite emphasis on breast-feeding. However, these latter observations (4) are consistent with the view that in humans (as in diabetes-prone rats (13) a diabetes associated immune response to bovine serum albumin (BSA) or to peptide fragments or portions thereof is triggered in the early post-natal period (14,15).An existing detection method for pre-clinical IDDM is based on detection of islet cell antibodies 

(16-18) . Unfortunately, this is a very difficult and laborious (2-day) assay which requires manual processing, visual judgment of results with its inherent inaccuracies. There are only a few centers in any country which can perform this assay according to international standards. Up to 20% of the population and 30-50% of IDDM family members have such antibodies. The test predicts clinical IDDM in only a subset of cases and is positive at diagnosis in only 80%.Animal work with BB diabetic rats showed detectable antibodies to bovine serum albumin in IDDM and in some animals without IDDM but with some histological islet changes (13) . Since not all animals showing such changes progress to overt IDDM, these studies did not indicate that detection of antibodies to bovine serum albumin could be predictive of progression to IDDM.Until the work of the present inventors, no convenient clinical method with sufficient predictive and discriminatory ability was available to screen human subjects and detect pre-clinical IDDM.Figures Figure 1: 1A: Serum IgG anti-BSA Antibody Concentrations at Diagnosis of Insulin-Dependent
