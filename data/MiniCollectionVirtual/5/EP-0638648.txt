<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to monoclonal 
antibodies, and more particularly to monoclonal antibodies 
specifically reacting with a platelet-activating factor 
receptor (PAF-R) which is a cell surface molecule, a 
process for producing the monoclonal antibodies, and 
hybridomas producing the monoclonal antibodies. A platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid 
found as a factor derived from a leukocyte and inducing 
the activation of platelets, for example, shape change, 
histamine release and aggregation, and has a structure of 
1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. PAF is a phospholipid autacoid produced in 
platelets, leukocytes, lung, spleen, kidney, brain, etc., 
has potent inflaming effect and hypotensive effect in a 
small amount, and is considered to participate in 
bronchial asthma, endotoxin shock, anaphylactic shock and  
 
the like. More specifically, PAF has not only a platelet-activating 
effect, but also neutrophil-activating effect, 
macrophage-activating effect, hypotensive effect, vascular 
permeability-accelerating effect, smooth muscle-contracting 
effect, glycogenolysis-accelerating effect in 
the liver, and the like, and is a factor involved in the 
development of anaphylaxis, inflammation, allergy and the 
like in vivo. PAF activates a target cell such as a 
platelet, neutrophil or macrophage through a receptor on a 
cell membrane. The presence of this physiologically active 
phospholipid was confirmed in 1972, and its structure was 
clarified in 1979. However, the analysis of the PAF 
receptor has not been very developed up to date. The 
reasons are considered, for example, to be as follows. 
Since PAF is lipophilic and high in nonspecific affinity 
for cell membranes, even a basic ligand binding experiment 
is difficult to conduct. Besides, since a receptor 
protein exists only in a small amount in a cell membrane, 
its purification is difficult. In 1991, Shimizu who is a coinventor of the present 
invention, et al. succeeded in isolating cDNAs of the PAF 
receptor from the guinea pig lung and human leukocytes 
using a genetic engineering technique (Nature, Vol. 349, 
342, 1991). From the structure of the PAF receptor 
presumed from these two cDNAs and expression experiments,  
 
knowledge as to the functions of PAF and PAF receptor, and 
the pathogenic mechanisms of morbid states associated with 
PAF is on the point of being obtained. However, the analysis of the PAF receptor at the 
protein level is not developed under the circumstances 
because a gene for
