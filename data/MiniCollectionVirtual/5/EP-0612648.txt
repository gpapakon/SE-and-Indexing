<ABSTRACT>
A trolley for hand-carrying suitcases and the like consists of a 
structure (1) provided with a pair of wheels (2), and it is provided with a 

device (8), pivoted on said structure (1), which acts as a load retaining 
device in a forward position, whereas when it is overturned backwards 

and locked on a back arc (6) by means of stops (7) it acts as a stand to 
rest the trolley in a backwards inclined position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns trolleys for hand-carrying items such as 
suitcases and the like, and in particular a trolley provided with an item retaining 
device suitable to act also as a supporting stand. It is known that many types of trolleys provided with a pair of wheels 
presently exist, for hand-carrying items of various kinds, such as suitcases, 
packages, bags, etc. Such trolleys are usually provided with retention devices 
for the carried item consisting in straps, elastic ropes, etc. and are capable of 
standing by resting on their base in a vertical position or a position slightly 
inclined forward, i.e. on the side where the carried item is positioned, in order to 
keep the center of gravity of the item-trolley assembly within the resting area. A similar type of trolley for carrying bulky items or for carrying 
simultaneously a plurality of items is provided with a supporting structure 
projecting backwards from the main trolley structure on which the pair of wheels 
is mounted. A typical example are trolleys conventionally used by porters in 
railway stations and the like, which, however, have a structure much heavier 
than that of the other above-mentioned types of trolley. From FR-A-899 201 a trolley is known, having all the features of the 
preamble of claim 1, in which both the supporting member at the back and a 
substantially U-shaped device or arc-shaped stand are pivotally mounted on the 
frame structure for rotating from opposite directions to the co-planarity with the 
frame, thus obtaining a minimum encumbrance, when no load is on the trolley 
and this is in a resting vertical position. However said U-shaped stand device has no function of load retention 
and in general the prior art trolleys suitable for carrying normally large items 
have never been able to stand, when loaded, in a backwards inclined position 
like porter trolleys, while the latter are too heavy and bulky to be easily used for 
carrying small-size items and/or to be transported by car, upstairs, etc. Therefore, the absence of a trolley combining the above-described 
characteristics results in a problem for those people, such as salesmen, which 
feel the need for a trolley which is light and small, yet capable of carrying items  
 
as large as a couple of large suitcases and capable of resting in a backwards 
inclined positions. The object of the present invention is to satisfy the above-cited need, 
thus solving the above-described problems. This object is achieved by means of a trolley as defined in the

<CLAIMS>
Trolley for hand-carrying items such as suitcases and the like, 
consisting of a structure (1) provided with a pair of wheels (2) mounted on an 

axle (3), with a member (6) supporting the load at the back of the trolley and 
with a device (8) consisting of a substantially U-shaped arc, connected to said 

structure (1) through pins (9) located on the inner face of the sides of said 
structure (1), characterized in that, said pins are located above said supporting 

member (6) and in that said device (8) is suitable for retaining the load on the 
trolley when it is turned forward of the structure (1) and for being overturned 

backwards within said structure (1), the device (8) being further provided with 
stops (7) for locking said device (8) in the overturned position as a stand 

suitable for supporting said trolley in a backwards inclined positions. 
Trolley according to claim 1, characterized in that the supporting 
member consists of a substantially U-shaped arc (6) projecting backwards from 

an area of structure (1) intermediate in height. 
Trolley according to claim 2, characterized in that stops (7) consist of a 
pair of curved members facing outwards and located on arc (6) internally with 

respect to the point of contact between device (8) and said arc (6). 
Trolley according to claim 2, characterized in that stops (7) consist of a 
pair of curved members facing inwards and located on arc (6) externally with 

respect to the point of contact between device (8) and said arc (6). 
Trolley according to claim 1, characterized in that stops (7) consists of 
linear sliders located inside structure (1) and suitable to engage corresponding 

holes formed in the body of pins (9) thereby preventing the rotation thereof. 
Trolley according to claim 1, characterized in that stops (7) consist of 
hooks facing upwards arranged along the back face of the sides of structure (1), 

and device (8) is provided with an additional arc pivoted thereto in such a 
position as to be able to engage said hooks. 
Trolley according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that structure (1) is provided with a pair of hinges (10)  

 
located on the sides of said structure (1) and suitable to allow the upper 

portion of said structure (1) to be folded. 
Trolley according to claims 2 and 7, characterized in that arc (6) 

is sufficiently narrower than structure (1) so as to allow the upper portion 
of said structure (1) to be folded backwards until it gets in touch with the 

lower portion of said structure (1). 
Trolley according to claim 7, characterized in that hinges (10) 
are located in an area of structure (1) intermediate in height such as to 

reduce by half the overall height of the folded trolley with respect to the 
extended trolley. 
Trolley according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that device (8) is provided with a recess (11) located on 

the base of the U and directed towards structure (1), suitable to exert a 
certain pressure on the load thereby keeping it pushed against the 

supporting member at the back and to make easier the grasping of said 
device (8) for the overturning operation in stand position. 
Trolley according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that device (8) is made up of two portions telescopically 

inserted one into the other and it is provided with means for locking its 
length adjustment. 
Trolley according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that structure (1) is provided with slots suitable to allow 

pins (9) to have a certain vertical travel, said pins (9) being provided with 
locking means suitable to fix them at the desired height.
