<ABSTRACT>
A urethane-resin based coating for reducing friction 
includes a urethane paint and a first powder. The coating is to be 

applied to a shaped article which is to be subjected to a heat 
treatment at a certain temperature after the application of the 

coating to the shaped article. The first powder has a melting 
point lower than the certain temperature and a solubility 

parameter which is smaller than or larger than that of the 
urethane paint by at least 0.5. The coating optionally further 

includes a second powder which has a melting point higher than 
the certain temperature. The coating provides the shaped article 

with low friction, irrespective of the coating film's thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a functional coating for
reducing friction, and more particularly to a urethane-resin based
functional coating which is to be applied to glass sliding portions
of a weatherstrip such as a glass run of an automobile, for
reducing friction between an automotive window glass and the
glass sliding portions of the weatherstrip.Hitherto, there have been various proposals to coat glass
sliding portions of a glass run of an automobile with coatings for
the purpose of reducing friction between an automotive window
glass and the glass sliding portions of the glass run. A glass run is
usually made of rubber so that the glass run is vulcanized for
improving its characteristics.For example, JP-A-1-133711 discloses a mouthpiece
structure of an extruder of glass run, whereby glass sliding
portions of the extruded glass run are coated with a coating
liquid, immediately after the extrusion of glass run.U.S. Patent No. 5,326,592 corresponding to JP-A-5-131519
also discloses a process and apparatus for coating selected surface
areas of extruded substrates with decorative or functional
coatings, immediately after the extrusion. The functional coatings
of this publication may include various polymers such as
polyurethanes for high abrasion resistance, polyesters for
weatherability, and silicones and TEFLON (a trade name)
polymers for low friction resistance.JP-A-3-161329 discloses a method of coating glass sliding
portions of an extruded glass run with a solvent-free urethane
coating, immediately after the extrusion. For reducing friction,
this urethane coating may contain a liquid-type agent such as a
silicone oil (dimethyl polysiloxane) or a solid-type agent such as
TEFLON resin powder, molybdenum disulfide, boron nitride,
tungsten disulfide, or fluorinated graphite. The extrudates which 
have been coated with coatings by the methods of all the above
publications are vulcanized later.JP-A-57-170314 discloses a glass run having glass sliding
portions on which fine particles (diameter: 5-500 µm) are
adhered for reducing friction.JP-B-1-24643 discloses a coating to be applied to glass
sliding portions of a glass run. This coating may be a solvent-thinned
two-package type urethane-resin coating and contains
first large-diameter particles (diameter: 10-30 µm) such as
particles of talc and second small-diameter particles (diameter: 2-10
µm) such as particles of tetrafluoroethylene (the most
preferable example), molybdenum disulfide, tungsten, or nylon.
The second small-diameter particles
