<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
producing so-called useful substances or of treating 
waste liquids based upon culturing and fermentation by 
using filamentous fungi such as mold, actinomyces and 
the like bacteria, as well as to a carrier for 
immobilizing filamentous fungi that is used for the 
above method and an immobilized fungus composition for 
culturing. In particular, the present invention is to improve 
the production of useful substances by controlling the 
size of mass of filamentous fungi, by increasing the 
rate of migration of substances such as oxygen and 
substrates and by improving the separation of fungi 
based upon the addition of a chain clay mineral carrier 
such as sepiolite of a formanite-type clay mineral to 
the culture solution. The present invention further 
attempts to apply the method to a process for the 
production by fermentation of useful substances from 
oils and fats as starting materials and for efficiently 
treating waste materials and waste waters containing 
animal and plant oils such as edible oils by 
effectively utilizing the oil-adsorbing property of a 
carrier composed of the formanite-type clay. The so-called filamentous fungi such as mold and 
actinomyces produce a wide range of useful substances 
like organic acids such as citric acid, gluconic acid 
and itaconic acid, antibiotics such as penicillin, 
cephalosporin C, chlorotetracycline and cephamycin C, as  
 
well as enzymes such as β-galactosidase, gluco amylase 
and lipase. However, the culture solution of these filamentous 
fungi has a high viscosity since fungi are entangling 
with each other, and the rate of feeding oxygen and 
substrates is limited causing the rate of production by 
fermentation and yields to be decreased. In recovering 
and refining the products formed by fermentation, 
furthermore, the fungi must be isolated from the culture 
solution by centrifuge or filtration. However, the 
culture solution of filamentous fungi has a viscosity 
which is so high that the isolation of fungi is very 
difficult imposing a serious hindrance upon the 
production on a commercial scale. In recent years, a process using immobilized 
microorganisms has been reported as a biocatalyst for 
the bioreactor. As a carrier for immobilization, there 
has been used an organic carrier such as calcium 
alginate or cellulose polyamide acrylate. These carrier 
materials, however, involve many problems from the 
standpoint of physical strength and chemical and 
biological resistance, and have not almost
