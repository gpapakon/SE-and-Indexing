<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to useful compounds in the 
field of medicaments and the use thereof; more specifically, 
to novel triterpene derivatives which can compete with 
endothelin for its receptors and are useful in the 
prophylaxis and treatment of diseases caused by excessive 
secretion of endothelin, and to pharmaceutical compositions 
containing the same. Endothelin, which has been described by M. 
Yanagisawa et al., Nature, 332, pp. 411, 1988, is an 
endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor peptide composed of 21 
amino acids and is considered to act on various organs and 
tissues including blood vessels, and the trachea 
through activation of specific receptors in cell membranes. 
It has been postulated that this peptide can cause 
contraction of smooth muscles and that an excessive 
secretion thereof may lead to various circulatory diseases 
such as hypertension, coronary ischemia, encephalopathy, 
nephropathy, circulation failure of various organs, and 
asthma.  
 It has been reported that TXA2-receptor 
antagonists and inhibitors of TXA2-synthetic enzyme and the 
like can prevent the increase in intracellular calcium-ion 
level following the excessive secretion of endothelin. 
However, there have been no reports about specific 
antagonists against endothelin so far and, therefore, the 
development of substances capable of inhibiting various 
actions of endothelin has been desired. In these circumstances, 
the inventors of the present Patent Application made intensive 
studies and found that certain triterpene derivatives extracted 
from Myricacerifera L. can specifically compete with 
endothelin for its receptors (PCT/JP/91/01707, WO92/12991, 
USP 5,248,807). The present inventors have done further work with 
a view to developing additional endothelin 
antagonists with higher activity and have now found that 
certain novel triterpene derivatives are useful to achieve 
said purposes. The present invention provides compounds 
of the formula (I) 
  
 
wherein R1 is hydrogen or an ester-residue which 
decomposes to reproduce biologically active carboxylic 
acid in a living body; and R2 is hydrogen or -R3-R4 
wherein R3 is -SO3-, -CH2COO-, -COCOO-, or -COR5COO- (R5 
is C1-C6 alkylene or up to C6 alkenylene ), and R4 is 
hydrogen, straight or branched C1-C6 alkyl, or an 
ester-residue which decomposes to reproduce 
biologically active carboxylic acid in a living body 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Although all compounds of formula (I) are highly 
active endothelin antagonists and are
