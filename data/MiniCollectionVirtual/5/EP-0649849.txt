<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for etherifying a hydroxymethyl group in position
3 of a cephalosporin.Processes which are known from literature describe for example the reaction of 7-aminocephalosporanic
acid (7-ACA) with an alcohol, trialkyl borate, trialkyl
orthoformate or dimethoxymethan in the presence of Lewis acids. In these
processes, however, the compounds of formula I are only obtained in small yields
and with low purity. Also, ecologically hazardous Lewis acids are employed, often
in a large excess.In EP 0 262 744, 7-ACA or a protected form thereof is reacted with an alcohol in
the presence of an excess of Lewis acids, such as SbCl5, BiCl3, FeCl3 or ZnCl2 to
form 7-amino-3-alkoxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid. However, only low yields
are obtained. The replacement of the alcohol with trialkyl borate or trialkyl
orthoformate and the use of the above-mentioned catalysts only leads to a slight
increase in yield (EP 0 343 926).In the reaction of 7-ACA with BF3/methanol in sulpholane, described in AT 384 222
(EP 0 204 657), a large excess of BF3 and high reaction temperatures are required.
Only low yields and poor quality of the 7-amino-3-methoxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic
acid (7-AMCA) are obtained. Japanese patent application 63/115887
describes a variant in which the highly poisonous fluorosulphonic acid is additionally
employed, without effecting a decisive improvement in the process, however.When using other catalysts, such as sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid
(JP 59/163387) or trifluoromethanesulphonic acid (EP 0 442 385), the compounds
of formula I are obtained in yields of only around 50%.The reaction of protected 7-ACA derivatives is described for example in Japanese
patent application 57/192392 and in DE 3,244,457. Here, the appropriately 
protected compounds of formula I are obtained only in moderate yields. Also,
additional reaction steps are required to protect and deprotect the starting and end
products. Even lower yields are obtained if a protected 3-halomethyl compound is
used as the starting compound to produce the appropriately protected 3-alkoxymethyl
compound according to AT 303 955 (GB 1,241,657).In AT 306 240 (GB 1,241,656), the process commences with a 7-amino-3-hydroxymethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic
acid which is protected at the carboxylic acid
group and at the amino group, and is then methylated in the presence of
BF3/diethyletherate at the hydroxymethyl function with diazomethane, which is
hazardous for reasons of industrial safety.It was now surprisingly found
