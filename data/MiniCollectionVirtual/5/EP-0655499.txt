<ABSTRACT>
The present inventors discovered a novel genome coding Phytolacca 
insularis antiviral protein(PIP) isolated from Phytolacca insularis Nakai; 

and developed a recombinant vector for said PIP genome expression and 
a microorganism transformed therewith. PIP genome of the present 

invention has nucleotide homology of about 82%, compared with the 
genome of Phytolacca americana antiviral
 protein isolated from 
Phytolacca americana L., which is closely related to the Phytolacca 

insularis Nakai. PIP cDNA is consist of 918bp of one open reading 
frame and termination codon; and polyadenylation signal which is 

ubiquitous in mRNA of most plants and animals, appears to be located 
in the upstream of 33bp from the polyadenylation site. Recombinant 

PIP of the invention was proved to inhibit the growth of E. coli HB101 
transformed with said expression vector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel nucleotide sequence and a 
recombinant vector, more specifically, a novel genome coding Phytolacca 
insularis antiviral protein("PIP") isolated from Phytolacca insularis Nakai 
and a recombinant expression vector therefor. Studies on the antiviral proteins from many different plant species, 
have been carried out, starting from the discovery of pokeweed antiviral 
protein("PAP") isolated from crude extract of Phytolacca americana 
L.[see: Irvin, J. D., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 169: 522-528(1975)]. In 
addition to the PAP, antiviral proteins have been isolated from several 
plants, e.g., Ricin(from Ricinus communis)[see: Halling, K. C. et al., 
Nucleic Acid Res., 13: 8019-8033(1985)], Mirabilis antiviral protein("MA 
P", from Mirabilis jalapa L.)[see: Kataoka, J. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266: 
8426-8430(1991)] and Î±-trichosanthin(from Trichosanthes kirilowii)[see: 
Zhang, X. et al., Nature, 321: 477-478(1986)]. Said antiviral proteins 
have been reported to be ribosome inactivating proteins("RIPs") having 
RNA N-glycosidase activities[see: Endo, Y. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 263: 
8735-8739(1988)]. In general, PAP from Phytolacca americana L. is classified as  
 
PAP-I, PAP-II and PAP-S that appear in spring leaves, summer leaves 
and seeds, respectively; and it is known that antiserum reactions among 
these PAPs are different[see: Irvin, J. D. et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 
200: 418-425(1980)]. Further, it has been known that ribosome of 
Phytolacca americana L. is depurinated by RNA N-glycosidase activity 
of PAP. On the other hand, immunoconjugate of PAP with CD4 or 
CD19 has been reported to inhibit the replication of human 
immunodificiency virus type 1[see: Jansen, B. et al., Cancer Res., 52: 
406-412(1992); Kim Y. W. et al., J. Immunol., 144: 1257-1262(1990); 
Myers, D. E. et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 136: 221-238(1991)]; in this 
connection, said PAPs have been supposed to be applicable to the 
treatment of AIDS. Accordingly, studies on the PAPs in a view of 
molecular biology have been actively carried out, including the nucleotide 
sequence analysis of cDNA and structural gene of PAP; precise celluar 
mechanism of PAP's biological activity; preparation of transgenic plant; 
and, application of the immunoconjugate. Under the circumstances, the inventors have made an effort to 
isolate antiviral protein from Phytolacca insularis Nakai originated in 
Ulung-Do in Korea, which is closely related to Phytolacca americana L. 
in terms of phylogeny. In accordance
