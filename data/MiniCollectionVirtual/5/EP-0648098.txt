<ABSTRACT>
An orthodontic brace (1) is easy to use and will not involve any difficulties with optimizing the relation between moment and force. The brace comprises a guide mechanism (2), which consists of an upper bending stable mounting bar (3), which via substantially rectilinear wires (5) is connected with two lower mounting bars (4), which via fastening locks (9) are fastened to an arch wire or a bracket (8) on the teeth desired to be moved. As the springs of the orthodontic brace are made up of the wires (5), which are made from a superelastic material, and which are fixed in the bars (3, 4), a desired moving, in relation to another tooth segment, may be obtained in form of a translation, which possibly is combined with a rotation of a tooth segment. The desired movement depends on the form of the guide mechanism (2). The applied force will substantially be constant, and due to the torsion stable guide mechanism, which with torsion stability is connected with a tooth to be moved, a self-adjusting contribution of moment is obtained. Consequently, an unintended rotation is obviated during the movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
ORTHODONTIC BRACE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION.The present invention relates to an orthodontic brace of the type co prising spring means of a superelastic material for establishing movement of the teeth desired to be moved, and fastening means whi are intended for fastening the spring means to force transmitti means, which are connected with the teeth for transmitting the actu tion force of the spring means to the teeth desired to be moved.For a correction of misaligned teeth small locks are placed on t teeth, these locks are so-called brackets, in which it is possible mount different types of wires, depending on the type of tooth mov ment desired to be carried out.In the majority of all cases orthodontics is carried out by means continuous arches, along which the tooth movements are carried ou This technique, which is called the straight-wire-technique, is co nected with drawbacks as friction arises between the locks and t wires, and as it is difficult to carry out a parallel translati along the arch. Furthermore, it is only possible to carry out too movements in the direction of the arch.In order to overcome the drawbacks by the straight-wire-technique so-called segmented technique has been developed, in which special shaped braces are applied between groups of teeth, which braces supp forces and momenta resulting in the tooth movements, and thereby t correction of the misaligned teeth, may be controlled in a more pr cise way.However, this requires a thorough knowledge of the relations betwe the geometry of the teeth, bone support, and the mechanical properti of the braces. It is especially important to have a precise knowled of how forces and momenta are released from these braces in order obtain a desired tooth movement. Though the arches remedy some of t drawbacks by the straight-wire-technique, they are complicated to u as a large degree of manual adjusting and a large professional ski is required in order to correctly apply and use the known braces. Fu thermore, the known braces will not make it possible in all situatio 

to obtain desired relations between moment and force during the tooth movement, which occurs after applying the known braces.It is also difficult to relate the forces and momenta directly to th so-called centre of resistance for a tooth. The centre of resistanc is defined as the point, through which the effect from simple forc 

 will result in a translation. The centre of resistance will normall be positioned approximately in the centre of a root of a tooth, tha is to say in the
