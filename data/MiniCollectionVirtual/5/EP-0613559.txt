<DESCRIPTION>
There is considerable commercial interest in simple, disposable, self-contained 
devices for performing biochemical diagnostic assays in extra-laboratory situations. Ideally 
such devices should avoid any need for complex manual procedures, such as a timed 
sequence of reagent additions to an analyte, and so be suitable for use by lay persons. According to Patent Specification WO90/11519 such devices can be of a kind 
comprising first and second liquid flow channels of porous materials leading from a 
respective pair of channel ends to a common site, which channels are operable to transfer 
liquid by capillary flow to the common site in sequentially timed manner following 
simultaneous application of the liquid to the pair of channel ends. In one more particular form of this kind of device the first and second channels 
merge into, and transfer liquid in sequentially timed manner to a common channel. It 
follows that thc later one of the first and second channels to transfer liquid to the common 
channel will itself also receive liquid from the other channel. The one channel accordingly 
receives two opposite flows which merge. After such merging it is normally appropriate 
for liquid flow to continue through the one channel in the same direction as the initial flow 
therein. However, continuing flow from the other channel can act undesirably against this 
result. An object of the present invention is to improve this last situation and to this end 
the invention provides a device for performing biochemical diagnostic assays comprising 
first and second liquid flow channels of porous material providing flow communication 
from a respective pair of channel ends to a common site, which channels are operable to 
transfer liquid by capillary flow to the common site in sequentially timed manner following 
simultaneous application of the liquid to the pair of channel ends, wherein said first and 
second channels interconnect and then both continue in ongoing separate flowpaths. Such 
an arrangement of channels can be equated with an electrical bridge circuit and, as such, 
conformed to produce a substantially predetermined flow condition through the channel 
interconection. At least part of the first and second channels may have hydraulic resistance 
in the longitudinal direction selected to provide said flow condition. One such condition 
of particular practical interest is that of null flow. Preferably, said first channel and said second channel each comprise respectively  
 
separate portions upstream and
