<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel polymeric materials suitable 
for use as dispersants of filler materials at high concentration 
in curable, fluid organic materials, to the compositions produced 
and cured composites obtainable therefrom. Composites of highly filled polymeric compositions are 
becoming increasingly used as materials of construction, 
particularly for kitchen sinks, kitchen surfaces and 
sanitaryware, because of their attractive appearance and hard 
wearing properties. Fluid, curable compositions containing high 
volumes of finely divided fillers suitable for forming such 
articles have been described in British Patent No. 1 493 393. 
This specification describes fluid, curable compositions wherein 
high volumes of filler of specified particle size are dispersed 
in a curable material using polymeric dispersants. The use of 
polymeric dispersants enable compositions to be obtained 
containing high volumes of finely divided fillers, for example 
50% by volume, which have a remarkably low viscosity enabling the 
compositions to be readily handled for example by pumping. This 
low viscosity, in turn, enables the compositions to be sold as 
fluid dispersions which can be readily transported to fabricators 
who can mould articles in inexpensive low pressure moulds. 
Although some sedimentation will inevitably occur on storage, the 
polymeric dispersant maintains the filler particles in a state of 
stable, deflocculation so that the sediment can be readily 
redispersed by mild agitation to give a dispersion in which the 
filler particles are substantially uniformly dispersed and will 
remain so whilst the composition is converted from a fluid 
dispersion to a fully cured composite. The presence of the 
polymeric dispersant, and its function of keeping the particles 
in a state of stable deflocculation, not only enables a low 
viscosity, redispersible dispersion to be obtained, but ensures 
that compatibility of the components is maintained as the 
composition is cured so that a cured product free from cracks and 
flaws is obtained.  
 It is also possible to fabricate moulded articles which have 
a viscosity too high to be of practical value as transportable, 
low viscosity, redispersible compositions. Nevertheless, these 
compositions are useful where the fabrication operation is 
carried out at the same location as the composition is prepared 
and where storage and redispersion are not a problem. These 
compositions must also contain fillers which are properly 
dispersed within the curable
