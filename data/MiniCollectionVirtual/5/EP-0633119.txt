<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improved take-off 
plate device (10) for removing molded articles (12) from 

a molding machine and delivering them to a transfer or 
receiving station. The device of the present invention 

includes a plate (14), one or more tubes (16) mounted to the 
plate for receiving molded articles, and one or more ejector 

bars (44) for engaging portions (52) of the molded articles 
to remove or eject them from the tubes. Each of the tubes 

is provided with a cooling passageway (36) for effecting 
cooling of the molded articles as they are moved between the 

molding machine and the receiving station. A bottom plug 
(24), which is in contact with the cooling passageway, is 

provided in each tube to more efficiently cool an end 
portion (29) of the molded article in the tube. Preferably, 

the bottom plug has an end surface (28) which matches the 
shape of the molded article end portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved device for 
holding and tempering a heated molded plastic article according to claim 1. 
The invention further relates to improved means 
for ejecting or removing the plastic articles from the 
device. The practice of removing injection molded plastic 
articles, such as PET preforms, from a mold by means of 
cooled tubes mounted on a robot take-off plate is well known 
in the art. U.S. Patent 
Re. 33,237 exemplifies the known take-off 
systems.  
 This patent shows an approach 
for removing molded articles, such as parisons, from a 
molding machine. As shown in Figure 3, 
the robot take-off plate has a number of open ended tubes 
embedded therein for receiving the molded articles. Again, 
the number of tubes present in the plate is determined by 
the number of molded articles produced during a single 
molding cycle. Each of the tubes is connected to a suction 
or vacuum source and/or a pressurized fluid source. The 
vacuum is used to retain the molded articles in the tubes, 
while the pressurized fluid is used to eject the molded 
articles from the tubes. The plate also has a series of 
cooling passages for cooling the plastic articles held in 
the tubes. The cooling passages may contain a circulating 
cooling fluid. The principal disadvantage of these systems is that 
should one of the molded articles stick in its tube while  
 
the others are successfully ejected, there is typically 
insufficient air or fluid pressure in the sticking tube to 
eject the stuck article. This is because all of the other 
empty tubes provide an open vent to discharge most of the 
available compressed air or fluid. Mechanical devices to eject molded articles from a 
take-off plate have also been used in molding systems. For 
example, a mechanical take-off plate ejector device 
has been illustrated in Plastics Technology, 
September, 1989, pp. 39-40. In this machine, 
mechanical knock-out pins are provided in each tube. The 
pins are mounted on a common ejector plate behind the main 
take-off plate. Actuation of this ejector plate effects 
simultaneous ejection of all molded articles or preforms 
within the carrying tubes. The disadvantage of this 
approach is the additional space required to accommodate the 
ejector plate. As a result of the presence of the ejector 
plate, the mold open stroke must be increased to allow the 
thicker tooling plate assembly to enter between the open 
mold halves to pick up the preforms. The additional opening 
and corresponding closing stroke thus
