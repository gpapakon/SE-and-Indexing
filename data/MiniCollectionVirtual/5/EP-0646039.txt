<ABSTRACT>
A filter element for the filtration of dust particles from gaseous media having two concentrically arranged cylindrical filter bodies (1, 2) each comprising two fluted filter cylinders (4, 5) arranged so as to provide a plurality of canals (6). The gas is filtered through the filter cylinders (4, 5) and exhausted via the canals (6). The lower ends of the filter bodies are sealed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FILTER ELEMENTThe present invention relates to a filter element for the filtration of dust particles from gaseous media.EP 490662 describes a filter element comprising several co-axially arranged carriers in each of which is contained a filter body so as to increase the effective filtration area, whereby the carrier and filter element are arranged such that the exhaust air channels completely cover the filter element, running in the lengthways direction. Prior art filter sleeves generally comprise a synthetic needled batt, whereby the opposing parts of both filter sleeves are joined to each other, thereby forming exhaust air channels. Prior art filter sleeves generally comprise a needled batt, particularly one comprising synthetic fibres, which may be coated with a suitable permeable material on each pressure side so as to raise the resistance to corrosion. The said prior art filter elements have the major disadvantage that the butting on of the individual elements results in a relatively long construction length, if the desired filter area is to be obtained. As well as the disadvantage of the long construction length and the associated difficulty of placing such long filter elements in filter devices, a further more worrying disadvantage is the insufficient cleaning effectiveness. Normally such filters are cleaned by passing pulses of compressed air along the exhaust air 

channels in order to shake off dust particles adhering' to the pressure sides of the filter. It has been shown that with such filters the pressure drop for the first element is so great that increasingly the pressure is insufficient for removing dust particles from subsequent elements. The aim of the invention is to provide a filter element having a simpler and more condensed construction and short construction length whilst retaining a high filtration capacity and allowing simple and regular cleaning of all applicable filter bodies or sleeves.According to the present invention there is provided a filter element for the filtration of particles from gaseous media, the filter element having cylindrical filter bodies each comprising at least two wave-like folded filter cylinders arranged such that a plurality of filtered gas exhaust channels are formed in between the said filter cylinders, the gas media to be filtered being initially directed along the other side of the filter cylinders outside the channels, wherein each filter body is contained in a carrier, the said channels flowing through the carrier and the carrier sealing an air

CLAIMS
1. A filter element for the filtration of particles from gaseous media, the filter element having cylindrical filter bodies each comprising two wave-like folded filter cylinders arranged such that a plurality of filtered gas exhaust channels are formed in between the said filter cylinders, the gas media to be filtered being initially directed along the other side of the filter cylinders outside the channels, wherein each filter body is contained in a carrier, the said channels flowing through the carrier and the carrier sealing an air inlet space between the filter bodies, and wherein the filter element comprises at least two concentrically arranged filter bodies contained in carriers and the lower ends of each filter body is sealed.
2. A filter element as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the ends of at least one of said filter bodies and the filter cylinders thereof are embedded in gas-tight fashion in the carriers or a sealing body for sealing the lower ends of the said filter body.
3. A filter element as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the filter element comprises at least one ring for the carrier or outermost filter body and at least one disc body supporting the innermost filter body and located in and removable from the ring 


body in a gas tight fashion.
4. A filter element as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that the disc body has a flange turned to the outer side of the carrier operable to be disposed in a corresponding receptor groove provided in the ring body.
5. A filter element as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4, characterised in that the disc body has a harness support in the innermost filter body.
6. A filter element as claimed in claim 1 or claim 5, characterised in that the carriers have a flush outer side the air channels of the filter body extending to be flush with the outer sides.
7. A filter element as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that a sealable nozzle body with concentric cylindrical compressed air channels all flowing over the filtered gas exhaust channels of the filter body is disposed on the carriers.
