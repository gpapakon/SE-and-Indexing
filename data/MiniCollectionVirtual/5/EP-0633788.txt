<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGINGBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to compositions for improving magnetic resonance imaging ("MRI"), magnetic resonance spectroscopy ("MRS'), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging ("MRSI"). More particularly, the present invention relates to multinuclear cluster compositions as magnetic resonance contrast media ("MRCM") .The technique of MRI encompasses the detection of certain atomic nuclei (those possessing magnetic dipole moments) utilizing magnetic fields and radio-frequency radiation. It is similar in some respects to X-ray computed tomography ("CT') in providing a cross-sectional display of the body organ anatomy with excellent resolution of soft tissue detail. The technique of MRI is advantageously non-invasive as it avoids the use of ionizing radiation.The hydrogen atom, having a nucleus consisting of a single unpaired proton, has the strongest magnetic dipole moment of any nucleus. Since hydrogen occurs in both water and lipids, it is abundant in the human body. Therefore, MRI is most commonly used to produce images based upon the distribution density of protons and/or the relaxation times of protons in organs and tissues. Other nuclei having a net magnetic dipole moment also exhibit a nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon which may be used in MRI, MRS, and MRSI applications. Such nuclei include carbon-13 (six protons and seven neutrons), fluorine-19 (9 protons and 10 

neutrons), sodium-23 (11 protons and 12 neutrons), and phosphorus-31 (15 protons and 16 neutrons) .While the phenomenon of MRI was discovered in 1945, it is only relatively recently that it has found application as a means of mapping the internal structure of the body as a result of the original suggestion of Lauterbur (Nature, 242. 190-191 (1973)). The fundamental lack of any known hazard associated with the level of the magnetic and radio- frequency fields that are employed renders it possible to make repeated scans on vulnerable individuals. Additionally, any scan plane can readily be selected, including transverse, coronal, and sagittal sections.In an MRI experiment, the nuclei under study in a sample (e.g. protons, 19F, etc.) are irradiated with the appropriate radio-frequency (RF) energy in a controlled gradient magnetic field. These nuclei, as they relax, subsequently emit RF energy at a sharp resonance frequency. The resonance frequency of the nuclei depends on the applied magnetic field. According to known principles, nuclei with appropriate
