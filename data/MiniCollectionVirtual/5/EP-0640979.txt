<ABSTRACT>
A memory which can transfer data words in burst mode in either row or column 
direction. First, the memory is divided into two sections with odd words stored in one section, 

even in the other. This allows ping pong buffers to be reading one word from memory while 
the next is being accessed. Also, the page height is set to be an odd number of words. 

Therefore, when the entire page is read in or out, seccessive words in either the row or column 
direction will always be alternately odd and even. If a partial image is read into the memory, 

this odd and even relationship will also hold. If an image with an even number of rows is read 
in, in order to preserve the sequential odd-even sequence, in every other column of the 

original data successive words are swapped so that the word order becomes 1, 0, 3, 2, etc. Then 
the addresses are also generated in staggered order, so that the words go into the correct 

location in memory. In this way, the word order of loading and reading of data is always 
successively odd and even regardless of the size of the image.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for operating a page memory, in particular
to a process of loading a rectangular image, in the form of a bit map, into a memory,
and reading a page out from the memory.In a typical printing system images are loaded either from an input scanner or
from a character generator to a page buffer which builds up a page bit map. When the
bit map is complete, the image is sent out, one line at a time, to the printer. At high
printing rates, the speed at which this transfer can take place from the page buffer to
the printer becomes a potentially limiting factor. What is required is a circuit that will
accomplish this transfer at high speed.This circuit arranges the image page buffer in the memory so that the image
buffer can be accessed at maximum speed in both slow scan and fast scan directions.
The page buffer uses an odd number of locations for the page height and applies data
swapping to bytes of partial images with even height.This invention accomplishes the objective by, first, providing two buffer
registers between the page buffer and the printer, one for transferring words in odd
page buffer locations, and one for transferring words in even locations. In this system,
one register is being loaded while the other is being read out, thus doubling the speed
of the circuit.A problem with this arrangement is that if the rows are read out, instead of the
columns, the words will either be all odd or all even, depending on the row number,
and the odd-even buffer system will not work at its rated speed. To remedy this defect,
this two-buffer register system is used in combination with a memory that has an odd
number of memory locations per column. To use a specific numerical example, in the
prior art a page height may be 1,000 bytes. In this invention, the page height would
either be 999 or 1,001 bytes. The result is that, if the memory is sequentially loaded,
as is the typical case, not only are sequential words in any column alternately odd and
even, but sequential words in any row are also alternately odd and even. The result of
this is that. when reading out either rows or columns of data, the odd-even buffer
registers will operate at rated speed.One additional problem is encountered with this system and must be
remedied. If a partial image, such as a text character, contains an even number of 
words per column and is loaded separately into the memory, the last word of one
column and the first word of the next column will both be either odd or even. The
remedy is to, first,

<CLAIMS>
A method for operating a page memory (10, 11) having a first and a second
section, one of said first and second sections being for storing words having odd

addresses and the other section for storing words having even addresses, the
page memory being capable of storing a two-dimensional page bitmap including

one or more two-dimensional rectangular image bitmaps, each image bitmap
being represented by a plurality of words and having an odd number of said

words in direction of the first dimension, the words in said direction alternately
having odd and even addresses, the method comprising the steps of:


allocating a memory region in said page memory, the memory region having a
plurality of memory locations each one for storing a word, the number of said

memory locations in said direction being odd,
loading said image bitmap into said memory region line-by-line with the lines being
parallel to said direction, by sequentially loading the words of said image bitmap

into said memory locations, thereby transferring a word in or from one section and
simultaneously receiving an address at the other section, and
sequentially reading out the entire page from said page memory, line-by-line with
the lines being parallel to said direction or being in direction of the second

dimension.
