<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet recording head and
a method of producing same.There are two types of ink jet recording heads, i.e.,
the piezoelectric vibration type in which ink is pressurized by
mechanically deforming a pressure chamber, and the bubble jet
type in which a heating element is disposed in a pressure
chamber and ink is pressurized by an air bubble produced by
heat of the heating element. Ink jet recording heads of the
piezoelectric vibration type are classified into two
categories, a first recording head using a piezoelectric
vibrator which is axially deformed, and a second recording head
using a piezoelectric vibrator which conducts flexural
displacement. The first recording head can be driven at a high
speed and performs recording at a high density, but requires a
cutting operation for producing the piezoelectric vibrator, and
a three-dimensional assembly operation for fixing the
piezoelectric vibrator to the pressure chamber, thereby 
producing a problem in that an increased number of production
steps are necessary. By contrast, in the second recording
head, the piezoelectric vibrator has a membrane-like shape, and
hence can be formed by baking the piezoelectric vibrator
integrally with an elastic film constituting the pressure
chamber. Consequently, the second recording head has a reduced
number of production steps. However, the second recording head
requires an area of a size sufficient to conduct flexural
vibration so that the pressure chamber has a large width,
thereby reducing the arrangement density.In order to solve the problem of a recording head using
flexural vibration, for example, Japanese Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. HEI5-504740 discloses an ink jet recording head
comprising: a substrate in which pressure chambers are formed
in a single-crystal silicon substrate of a (110) lattice plane;
and a nozzle plate in which a plurality of nozzle openings
communicating with the pressure chambers are formed and which
is fixed to one face of the substrate. The other face of the
substrate is formed as a membrane which is elastically
deformable. A driving portion is integrally disposed by
forming a piezoelectric film on the surface of the membrane by
a film formation method. The driving portion conducts flexural
vibration so as to pressurize ink in the pressure chambers,
thereby ejecting ink drops from the nozzle openings.In the disclosed head, the pressure chambers, ink
supply ports attached to the chambers, and a reservoir are 
formed by conducting anisotropic etching on
