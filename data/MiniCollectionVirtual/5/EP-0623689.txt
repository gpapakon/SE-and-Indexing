<ABSTRACT>
Plate-shaped substrates 3 are fitted in circular impressions 2 in a carrier (support pallet) 1 for sputtering. The diameter B of the impressions is larger than the diameter A of the substrates. A mask 6 has circular recesses 8 having a diameter C which is smaller than the diameter A of the substrates and lies flat on the carrier.

<CLAIMS>
Device comprising a carrier palette and masks for coating substrates of optical storage media
by sputtering a target, with a number of circular depressions in the carrier palette, in which

depressions the substrates are disposed, characterized in that each one of the depressions (2) exhibits
a central overlay (4) on which the substrate (3) rests and that a mask (6) rests flat on the carrier

palette (1) and, corresponding to the depressions (2), exhibits circular recesses (8) having a diameter
(C) smaller than the diameter (B) of the depressions (2).
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that further masks (7) of T-shaped cross-section
are in contact with the overlays (4), flushly rest onto the substrates (3) and cover over a

central hole (5) of each substrate (3).
Device as claimed in claim 2, charactrized in that a transverse part (9) of the mask (7) has
a diameter (F) greater than a diameter (E) of the overlay (4).
Device as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that a diameter of a vertical part (10) of the
mask (7) is smaller than a diameter (E) of the overlay (4).
