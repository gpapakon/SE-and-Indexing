<ABSTRACT>
A black matrix can be formed by thermal transfer on a receptor substrate for use, for example, in a display application. This black matrix can be used, for example, as a color filter black matrix or a TFT (thin film transistor) black matrix to provide contrast and/or to separate adjacent electrically-conducting components.

<DESCRIPTION>
 THERMAL TRANSFER OF A BLACK MATRIX CONTAINING CARBON BLACKField of the InventionThis invention relates to the thermal transfer of a black matrix onto a receptor and related thermal transfer donor sheets and products made therefrom. In particular, the invention relates to the thermal transfer of a black matrix onto a receptor using a thermal transfer donor sheet having a donor layer that includes carbon black.BackgroundBlack matrix coatings are used in many display applications to absorb ambient light and improve contrast. The black matrix is formed around individual pixels or light emitters of the display. In many liquid crystal displays (LCDs), the black matrix is a 0.1 to 0.2 μm coating of black chromium oxide on a display substrate. Black chromium oxide is typically sputtered onto the display substrate and is a relatively expensive process. In addition, the black chromium oxide typically forms a metallic surface with higher than desired reflectivity (and correspondingly reduced contrast). Furthermore, there are environmental and health concerns associated with chromium.Resin black matrix (a pigment in a resin matrix) has been suggested as an alternative to black chromium oxide. The resin black matrix is coated onto the display substrate and then patterned using photolithography. To achieve a high optical density in a thin resin black matrix coating, it is typically necessary to use relatively high pigment loadings. This makes photolithography difficult because the patterning light (e.g., ultraviolet (UN) light) typically does not penetrate well into coatings with high optical densities. In addition, coatings with high levels of pigment have less resin. Because resin is the component of a coating that is etched, high optical density coatings (i.e., coatings with high pigment content) may not etch cleanly.Summary of the InventionGenerally, the present invention relates to the formation, by thermal transfer, of a black matrix on a receptor substrate for use, for example, in a display application. In particular, the present invention is directed to methods of making a color filter black 

matrix and/or a TFT (thin film transistor) black matrix, as well as the thermal transfer elements suitable for use in the methods, and the articles formed by the methods.One embodiment is an optical display that includes a substrate, pixel elements disposed on the substrate, and a black matrix disposed between the pixel elements. Each of the pixel elements includes at least one electrically-conducting element to
