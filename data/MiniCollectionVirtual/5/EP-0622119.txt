<ABSTRACT>
The invention resides in the field of dispensing of test elements (4) for conducting analyses. A system according to the invention comprises several test elements (4) which are each sealed (5) in a vapour-tight manner. A system according to the invention for dispensing simplifies removal of test elements (4) and protects the test elements contained therein against the action of external influences.

<CLAIMS>
System (1) for storing and dispensing test elements
(4) for analyzing sample liquids in which two or

more test elements are individually located in
water-vapour-tight chambers (2) of a storage

container (3) made of a rigid material and the
chambers (2) have a tubular shape with their

longitudinal axes arranged parallel to one another
and at one end they have a first opening and at the

other end a second opening (12) which are closed by
means of a first and second foil so that the inside

space of the chambers is sealed against water
vapour from the environment and there are one or

several devices (11, 14) on the outside of the
chambers to pierce the first foil and push the test

element stored in the respective chamber out of the
chamber in the process of which the

element pierces the second foil and the side of the
test element opposite to the second foil forms an

angle between 1° and 45° to the second foil.
System (1) as claimed in claim 1 in which the
openings of the chambers (2) are sealed water-vapour-tight

by means of a foil made of aluminium
or aluminium laminate which is glued, pressed or

welded on.
System as claimed in claim 1 in which the edge of a
test element and the sealed opening opposite this

edge form an angle which is greater than 5° but
smaller than 45°. 
System as claimed in claim 1 in which a desiccant
is present in the chambers of the system.
System as claimed in claim 1 in which a data
carrier is affixed to the storage container.
System as claimed in claim 1 in which the device
for piercing the sealing foil i
s a spike which is
moved from chamber to chamber and is used to pierce

the first foil of the respective chamber where it
is located.
System (1) as claimed in claim 1 in which the
piercing device comprises a ram (11), guide pins

(15), and a casing (14), wherein pressure is
exerted on the ram when the casing is over the

guide pins such that the ram pierces the sealing
foil.
System (1) as claimed in claim 1 in which the cross
sections of the chambers have the shape of a

circular segment and the chambers are arranged such
that the storage container has the shape of a

cylinder.
Method for dispensing test elements

which are individually located in tubular shaped
chambers (2) of a rigid storage container (3), the

longitudinal axes of the chambers are parallel to
one another and have openings (12) at both ends

that are sealed by a foil,
 
wherein a foil that seals the first opening of a

chamber is pierced and mechanical pressure is
exerted on the test element contained in the

chamber which pushes the test element out of the
chamber and the test element pierces a second foil

that seals the second opening of the chamber when
exiting the chamber.
Method as claimed in claim 9 in which the second
foil and the opposite edge of the test element form

an acute angle.
Method as claimed in claim 10 in which the angle is
between 1° and 45°.
Method as claimed in claim 9 in which the first
foil which seals the first opening is pierced with

a spike and the spike is moved from chamber to
chamber in order to pierce the individual sealing

foils.
Method as claimed in claim 9 in which test elements
are inserted directly from the storage container

into an instrument for analyzing sample liquids.
