An optical scanning device suitable for reading not only 
an optical but also a magneto-optical recording medium as 

well as a combination of optical and magneto-optical 
recording medium (CD) on which data are stored on top of each 

other in a magnetic layer (MO) and also by means of so-called 
pits (P), the light beam from a light source (LS) being 

focused onto the recording medium (CD) and reflected from the 
recording medium (CD) radiating through a first λ/2 disc

light beam, depending on its direction of polarization, on 

to a first or second photodetector (PD1, PD2), the output of 
the first and the second photodetector (PDT, PD2) being 

connected to the inputs of a first differential amplifier
