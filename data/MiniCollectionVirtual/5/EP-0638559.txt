<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel pyrazine
derivative and more particularly to a pyrazine derivative
capable of exhibiting excellent therapeutic responses in
infectious diseases caused by acid-fast bacteria,
particularly Mycobacteriumtuberculosis (briefly, M.
tuberculosis), Mycobacteriumavium (briefly, M. avium)
and Mycobacteriumintracellulare (briefly, M. intracellulare)
and in mixed infections where two or more
different kinds of such acid-fast bacteria are associated.Pyrazinamide (or pyridinecarboxamide) is an
antituberculosis agent which acts bactericidally against
intracellular tubercle bacillus (M. tuberculosis), in
particular. However, pyrazinamide has no antibacterial
activity against other acid-fast bacteria such as M.
avium and M. intracellulare and, therefore, is not
expected to be effective against the M. avium complex
which is becoming a more and more serious problem with
the spread of AIDS. Therefore, even if acid-fast
bacteria are detected in the patient by the Ziehl-Neelsen
stain-microscopic examination of the sputum, no therapy 
can be immediately instituted and because of the need for
differentiation as to whether the infection is associated
with M. tuberculosis or due to the M. avium complex, a
waiting time of several weeks is necessary for the
institution of a therapy.It is an object of this invention to provide a
pyrazine derivative capable of exhibiting excellent antibacillar
activity not only against M. tuberculosis but
also against M. avium and M. intracellulare.It is a further object of this invention to
provide a pyrazine derivative capable of exhibiting
excellent therapeutic efficacy in infectious diseases
caused by an acid-fast bacteria, particularly M.
tuberculosis, M. avium or M. intracellulare.It is a still further object of this invention
is to provide a pyrazine derivative capable of exhibiting
excellent therapeutic efficacy in mixed infections caused
by two or more different kinds of acid-fast bacteria, for
example the mixed infection due to the M. avium complex.It is still another object of this invention to
provide a process for producing such pyrazine derivative.Other features of this invention will become
apparent as the following description proceeds.The pyrazine derivative of this invention is a 
novel compound undisclosed in literature and can be
represented by the following general formula (1)

wherein R1 represents an octyl group or a pivaloyloxymethyl
group.The pyrazine derivative of the above general
formula (1) is a compound capable of exhibiting excellent
