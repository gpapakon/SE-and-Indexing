<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of a triglyceride mixture with 
an approximately random distribution of the fatty acid 

residues over the glyceride positions Sn1, Sn2 and Sn3, by 
subjecting in the presence of water a triglyceride fat to 

the activity of a 1,3-specific lipase.
 

The process is a multi-step process which includes a first 
step wherein the triglycerides are subjected to enzymatic 

action in the presence of diglycerides amounting 4-30 wt.% 

on total fat content and a second step wherein the 
diglyceride concentration in the reaction mixture is 

reduced, e.g. by removal of water, optionally after 
addition of fatty acids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention deals with an interesterification 
process of triglyceride fats. More particularly the process 
concerns an enzymatic interesterification process. Interesterification processes of triglycerides are directed 
to an exchange of the fatty acid residues of the 
triglyceride molecules. In the resulting triglycerides the 
fatty acid residues have been substituted by different 
residues, originating from the same or different glyceride 
molecules or from free fatty acids that may be present in 
the reaction mixture. The interesterification process needs a catalyst, which 
often is an alkali metal hydroxide or an alkali metal 
alkanolate, such as sodium methanolate. At equilibrium the 
exchange of fatty acid residues results in a statistically 
even (random) distribution of the fatty acid residues over 
the three carbon positions of the glyceride molecule. Alternatively, a lipase enzyme may be used as a non-chemical 
catalyst. Some interesterification lipases, the 
1,3-specific lipases to which many Rhizopus lipases belong, 
only catalyse reactions on the positions Sn1 and Sn3 of the 
glyceride molecule. The ester bond on the Sn2 position 
remains unaffected, with the result that the randomisation  
 
process is limited to the terminal positions of the 
glyceride molecule. It goes without saying that after a 
interesterification treatment which affects only the 
terminal fatty acid residues, triglyceride mixtures are 
obtained of a nature which is quite different from the 
fully randomised triglycerides known from chemical 
interesterification. A consequence is that the extensive 
knowledge on and experience with fully randomised 
interesterified fats can no longer be used.
 
Other enzymes, comprising only a few non-specific lipases 
including Candida cylindracae and Arthrobacter lipases, are 
able to catalyse the hydrolysis and subsequent reformation 
of all three ester bonds with the effect that the 
randomisation extends also to the Sn2 position (full 
randomisation).
 
Processes for enzymatic interesterification processes are 
described in e.g. WO 91/08676 (KRAFT). Present consumer preference shifts to food and food 
ingredients which have not been exposed to chemical 
treatments. Therefore a general need exists for non-chemical 
modification processes of triglyceride fats. For 
interesterification an enzymatic process is preferred, 
because it does not change the naturalness of the fat 
product. However, fully randomised fats can only be 
obtained with non-specific lipases, which
