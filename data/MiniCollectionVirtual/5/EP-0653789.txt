<ABSTRACT>
An electronic package (10) and method of making same wherein a 
flexible circuitized substrate (13) is used to interconnect 

contact sites on a semiconductor device (chip) (15) to 
respective conductors on a circuitized substrate (PCB) (11). 

Significantly, the flexible substrate is coupled to the PCB 
using solder elements (51) which are applied to the flexible 

substrate prior to semiconductor device coupling to others of 
the flexible substrates' conductive elements. These other 

conductive elements are then connected to the devices' contact 
sites using thermocompression bonding, the bonding occurring 

through an aperture in the flexible substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic packaging structures 
(assemblies) and particularly to such structures which utilize 
thin film flexible circuitized substrates as part thereof. 
Even more particularly, the invention relates to such 
packaging structures which may be utilized in the information 
handling systems (computer) field. In Serial Number (S.N.) 07/903,838, filed June 24, 1992 and 
entitled "Packages For Stacked Integrated Circuit Chip Cubes", 
there is defined an integrated circuit (IC) package wherein 
two flexible circuitized substrates each include leads which 
are bonded to a semiconductor chip through apertures in the 
substrate, such bonding made possible using thermocompression 
bonding, among other techniques. The leads may then be 
encapsulated in polymer, e.g., epoxy. Both flexible 
substrates are coupled electrically by a third, common 
flexible substrate, which couples the chips to another 
substrate. An elastomer is used to press the parallel chips 
against a heat sink, for heat dissipation purposes. Electronic packaging structures of the type described above 
are known in the art including, for example, those shown and 
described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,849,856 (Funari et al), 
4,914,551 (Anschel et al), 4,962,416 (Jones et al) and 
4,965,700 (McBride). See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,057,969 (Ameen 
et al), 5,115,964 (Ameen et al), 5,133,495 (Angulas et al) and  
 
5,203,075 (Angulas et al) for related structures. Such 
packaging structures, as defined in these patents, typically 
utilize at least one thin film, flexible circuitized substrate 
as part thereof. Typically, such circuitized substrates 
include a thin dielectric (e.g., polyimide) layer having at 
least one circuit layer (e.g., chrome-copper-chrome) thereon. 
Such thin film, flexible circuitized substrates may be 
positioned on and electrically coupled to another circuitized 
substrate (e.g., printed circuit board) to thereby 
electrically couple a semiconductor device (chip), which is 
connected to respective portions of the thin film, circuitized 
substrate's circuitry, to corresponding circuitry on the 
additional substrate. The aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 
4,849,856, 4914,551, 4,962,416 and 5,057,969 illustrate 
representative examples of such packaging structures which 
utilize this means of connection. Thin film, flexible circuitized substrates as produced today 
possess several distinct advantages (e.g., high density, 
flexibility, relative ease of manufacture, etc.) desired in 
the information handling systems
