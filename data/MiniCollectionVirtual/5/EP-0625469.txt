<ABSTRACT>
1. Package, especially hinged-lid box made of thin card for cigarettes or other smoking articles. 2.1. Hinged-lid boxes are usually constructed in such a way that a lid (14, 15) is connected pivotably to a box part (12, 13). To increase the holding capacity, a double pack of two individual hinged-lid boxes (10, 11) is formed from a common, one-piece blank. The latter is designed in such a way that the double pack is folded according to the transverse wrapping principle and then two end regions are each provided with a lid (14, 15). The lids (14, 15) can be opened in opposite directions. 2.2. Inside the double pack, the individual hinged-lid boxes (10, 11) are separated from one another approximately centrally by bottom walls (34, 35). The bottom walls (34, 35) are parts (bottom flap 67) of the collar (36, 37).

Pack, namely a hinge-lid pack, made from thin 
cardboard, consisting of a pack part (12, 13) with a lid 

(14, 15) arranged on each of mutually opposite end 
regions of the latter and connected pivotably thereto, a 

double pack which consists of two individual hinge-lid 
packs (10, 11) being formed from a common blank and, 

within the double pack, at least one bottom wall (34, 35) 
between the individual hinge-lid packs (10, 11) being 

provided from a separate blank, and the bottom wall (34, 

35) being formed as part of at least one collar (36, 37) 
having a collar front wall (38), characterized in that a 

bottom tab (67), adjoining the collar front wall (38), 
for forming the bottom wall (34, 35) is folded into a 

position at an acute angle to the collar front wall (38), 
in such a way that the bottom wall (34, 35) is directed 

obliquely. 
Pack according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
a lid rear wall (26) of one lid (14) is part of a main 

wall (41) of the double pack and a lid rear wall (27) of 
the other lid (15) is part of a main wall (42) lying 

opposite the main wall (41), in such a way that the lids 
(14, 15) are laterally reversed or are offset at 180Â° 

relative to one another. 
Pack according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the two individual hinge-lid packs (10, 11) have 

their own bottom wall (34, 35) so that a double-layer, 
obliquely-directed partition wall is formed for dividing 

the double pack. 
Pack according to Claim 3, characterized in that  
 

the bottom tab (67) has a larger width than the inner 
width of the double pack or of the individual hinge-lid 

packs (10, 11), in such a way that, in the oblique 
position, a free edge of the bottom tab (67) can be 

supported on a wall (rear wall 18, 19) located opposite 
the collar front wall (38). 
Pack according to Claim 1 or one of the further 
claims, characterized in that the double pack consists of 

a one-piece blank, in which, in each case, two main walls 
(41, 42) successively form a lid front wall (24 and 25), 

a front wall (16 and 17) of a pack part (12, 13), its 
rear wall (18, 19) and a lid rear wall (26, 27), the 

front wall (16 and 17) on the one hand and the lid front 
wall (24, 25) on the other hand being separated from one 

another, in each case, by means of a punching cut (52, 
53), preferably with severable residual connections (54). 
Pack according to Claim 1 or one of the further 
claims, characterized in that the one-piece blank for 

forming the double pack is constructed on the cross-winding 
principle, a side-wall strip (43) being arranged 

between the main walls (41, 42) in order to form side 
walls (22, 23) of the two individual hinge-lid packs (10, 

11) and to form lid side walls (32, 33), the regions of 
the side walls (22, 23) being separated from the lid side 

walls (32, 33) by means of an obliquely directed punching 
cut, namely an oblique cut (56, 57), and the oblique cuts 

(56, 57) adjoining the punching cuts (52, 53) of the main 
walls (41, 42). 
Pack according to Claim 6 or one of the further 
claims, characterized in that a continuous side-wall 

strip (44) for forming further opposite side walls (20, 
21) and for forming lid side walls (30, 31) is arranged 

on a free edge of a main wall (41), the regions of the 
side walls (20, 21) on the one hand and of the lid side 

walls (30, 31) on the other hand being separated from one 
another by means of obliquely extending punching cuts, 

namely oblique cuts (55 and 58). 
Pack according to Claim 6 or 7, characterized in 
that an edge strip (45) is arranged on the free edge of  

 
the side-wall strip (44), for connection to a main wall 

(42) adjacent in the folded double pack, the edge strip 
(45) having an additional cut (59) which adjoins the 

oblique cut (58) of the side-wall strip (44) and

claims, characterized in that part strips (61, 62) are
