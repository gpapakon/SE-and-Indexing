<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a flow cell device for the monitoring of 
blood or any cells suspension under flow. More specifically, the object 
of the present invention is to easily monitor the cells - particularly 
red blood cells - and their dynamic organization under flow conditions, 
as well as their shape and deformability ,using small samples of 
suspensions, with a safe and cost effective procedure. The flow of 
blood or other cells suspension in the abovementioned flow cell is 
visualized through a microscope. The supplying and receiving of the 
suspension sample to and from the flow cell is by means of syringes or 
any other appropriate device. This invention may be used in a system 
connected to a video camera, computer and image monitor (Computerized 
image analyzer system). Red blood cells at rest (stasis) forms aggregates, which are 
disaggregated gradually with increasing blood flow. The degree of 
aggregation and the aggregate structure reflect a delicate balance 
between chemical and hydrodynamic forces. In stasis, when flow forces  
 
are absent, the interaction between the cell membrane and plasma 
proteins will cause the red cells to aggregate into stacks called 
rouleaux, which further interact to form networks. Cell aggregation is 
a reversible process and the blood therefore follows dynamic changes 
according to flow conditions. The aggregability of red blood cells 
(hereinafter called RBC), which is a major determinant in blood 
circulation, strongly depends on the cells physical and chemical 
properties, and is very sensitive to changes in these properties. The 
size and number of red blood cell aggregates dominate the blood 
viscosity which plays a central role in blood flow in vessels of 
constant diameter. Thus the blood flow to tissues is largely affected 
by the aggregability of the RBC. The tendency of RBCs to form 
aggregates and thrombi under flow is a structural property of dynamic 
origin which is closely associated with the risk of diminished blood 
supply and the plugging of small blood vessels, pathologies which are 
important factors in stroke, shock, and damage caused to organs by 
various vascular diseases. The aggregation and disaggregation of RBC 
play a centeral role in blood flow, especially in microvessels and in 
states of lowered blood flow. Increased RBC aggregability occurs in 
many disease states (e.g. coronary heart diseases, diabetes, 
hyperviscosity syndrome, thrombosis, trauma and sickle cell anemia), 
and is considered to be a risk factor. Recent
