<ABSTRACT>
A lighting device including an optical guide (1) with a core made of a primary transparent material. The optical guide (1) has one surface with an object (4) to be lit up placed thereon, and a lighting section. A first light reflecting layer (9) with breaks (10) is arranged between the surface (3) and the object (4). Said first layer (9) is preferably transparent and has a lower refractive index than the primary material.

<CLAIMS>
A lighting device comprising at least one plate-shaped light 
guide (1) whose core is made of a main transparent material, the light guide 

(1) possessing an illumination edge (5) and at least one face (3) that 
delimits the guide, the guide being illuminated via said edge (5) from at least 

one light source (6) and being designed to illuminate an object, an image, or 
a structure (4) deposited on said face (3), the device being characterised in 

that said face is covered at least in part by a first layer (9) of a substance 
designed to reflect the light transmitted by said light guide, said first layer 

(9) having discontinuities (10) such that light flux reaching said face (3) in 
the zone of a discontinuity (10) illuminates an object, an image, or a 

structure (4) deposited on said face (3) covered by said first layer (9) and in 
contact with the light guide material through said discontinuities. 
The device according to claim 1, characterised in that said layer 
(9) is made of a first secondary transparent material whose refractive index 

is lower that the refractive index of said main material. 
The device according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the ratio of the area of a discontinuity (10) to the area of the object (4) 

to be illuminated is less then one-tenth. 
The device according to claim 3, characterised in that the ratio of 
the area of a discontinuity (10) to the area of the object (4) to be illuminated 

is less then one-thousandth. 
The device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that said discontinuities (10) comprise at least a plurality of circular 

shaped interruptions in said first layer (9). 
The device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that it includes a second layer (12) deposited on said first layer (9) and 

made of a second secondary transparent material, said second material 
being in contact with the material of the light guide (1) through said 

discontinuities (10), the object, the image, or the structure (4) to be 
illuminated being deposited on the back (13) of said second layer (12). 
The device according to claim 6, characterised in that said 
second secondary material possesses a refractive index that is substantially 

equal to that of the main material.  
 
The device according to any one of claims 6 to 7, characterised 
in that the first layer (9) is constituted by a film of air or of liquid. 
The device according to any one of claims 6 to 8, characterised 
in that the discontinuities (10) are in the form of strips that are parallel to the 

light flux propagation direction. 
The device according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that the ratio of the area of the discontinuities (10) to the area of the face 

covered by the first layer (9) varies as a function of the zone in which said 
layer is applied. 
The device according to claim 10, characterised in that said ratio 
increases with the distance separating said zone from the illumination edge 

(5). 
The device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the discontinuities (10) are made in the form of projections on the 

face of the light guide that is covered by the image (4). 
The device according to claim 12, characterised in that the first 
layer (9) is constituted by a film of air or of liquid. 
The device according to any one of claims 12 or 13, 
characterised in that the image (4) is in intimate contact with the tops of the 

projections. 
The lighting device comprising at least one plate-shaped light 
guide (1) whose core is made of a main transparent material, the light guide 

(1) possessing an illumination edge (5) and at least one face (3) that defines 
the guide, the guide being illuminated via said edge (5) from at least one 

light source (6) and being designed to illuminate an object, an image, or a 
structure (4) deposited on said face (3), characterised in that said face is 

covered at least in part by a first layer made of a substance whose 
refractive index is lower than the refractive index of said main material, and 

in that said first layer comprises discontinuities in such a manner that light 
flux reaching said face in the zone of a discontinuity directly illuminates the 

portion of the object, image or structure that is in contact with the material of 
the light guide through said discontinuity.
