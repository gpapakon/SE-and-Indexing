<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a 
method of processing white liquor (3) 

obtained from the causticization step of 
a pulp mill, in which method the infeed 

white liquor (3) principally contains 
sodium hydroxide (6) and sodium sulfide 

(7). The method according to the 
invention is characterized in that the 

sodium hydroxide (6) contained in the 
white liquor (3) is separated from the 

white liquor (3) either entirely or 
partly by means of a diffusion dialysis 

process (4). The invention is further 
characterized in that the sodium 

hydroxide (6) separated from the white 
liquor (3) is advantageously entirely 

returned back to the chemical circulation 
of the pulp mill.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method according to the 
preamble of claim 1 for separating sodium hydroxide from 
white liquor. In the near future, the production volume of totally 
chlorine free pulps (TCF pulps) manufactured entirely 
without the use of chlorine bleaching chemicals will 
increase. With the change to oxygen-peroxide-based 
bleaching methods, the need by bleach plants for a supply 
of purified sodium hydroxide, NaOH, will increase. Besides, 
the manufacture of TCF pulps will permit effluent-free 
closed-cycle circulation of bleach plant waters and their 
recycling back to the chemical circulation. When such water 
circulations are closed, sodium will accumulate in the 
chemical recovery cycle in excess amounts, but, 
unfortunately, in difficult-to-utilize form. Bleaching of TCF pulps requires purified NaOH to keep the 
consumption of other bleaching chemicals as low as possible. 
Conventionally, pulp mills have been forced to 
purchase such purified caustic soda for the needs of the 
bleach plant from chemical suppliers. As the closed-cycle 
operation of the bleach plant of a paper mill and its 
chemical cycles results in excess accumulation of sodium in 
the chemical recovery cycle, in-plant production of NaOH 
directly from the chemical circulation becomes a topical 
issue. Purified caustic soda, NaOH, is used in the plant mostly in 
pulp bleaching, at its alkaline step proper, and additionally 
in other alkaline steps of the bleach plant including 
the production of sodium hypochlorite, use as the make-up 
chemical of the chemical circulation and as a neutralizing 
agent. Purified caustic soda is also used in scrubbing of  
 
stack gases. Sodium sulfite, Na2SO3 obtained from the 
scrubber can be returned back to the chemical circulation. According to the prior art, the principal method of sodium 
hydroxide production is the electrolysis of sodium chloride 
into chlorine and so-called equivalent caustic. NaOH can 
also be produced by other methods, e.g., using the cooling-crystallization-causticization 
process in which green 
liquor is first cooled to crystallize the sodium carbonate 
contained therein and then the sodium carbonate is causticized. 
Such a process requires the use of two parallel 
causticization lines from this point on up to the separation 
of the caustic soda. Conventional methods of producing NaOH also include 
electrodialytic decomposition of sodium sulfate into NaOH 
and sulfuric acid, whereby the caustic concentration thus 
obtained is approx. 15 % NaOH. The
