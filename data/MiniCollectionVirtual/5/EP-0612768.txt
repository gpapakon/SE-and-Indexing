<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an ethylene/α-olefin 
copolymer is provided in which ethylene is copolymerized 

with an α-olefin having three or more carbons by use of an 
olefin polymerization catalyst at a polymerization 

temperature of not lower than 120°C. The olefin 
polymerization catalyst comprises, as constitutional 

components, a) a metallocene compound, b) an ionizing 
ionic compound, and c) an organoaluminum compound, the 

ionizing ionic compound (b) being a compound which is 
capable of changing the metallocene compound (a) into a 

cationic form and does not further react with the cationic 
form of the metallocene compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer with an olefin 
polymerization catalyst constituted of a metallocene 
compound, an organoaluminum compound, and an ionizable 
ionic compound. The low-pressure Ziegler process for 
polymerization of ethylene or an α-olefin is well known in 
the related technical fields. The catalyst for the 
process is generally prepared by treating a mixture of an 
organometallic compound or hydride of a metal of Group 1A 
to 3A of the Periodic Table with a compound of a transition 
metal (Group 3B or 2B of the Periodic Table) in a suspension 
or a solution, or in the absence of a solvent or a 
diluent. In recent years, special kinds of catalysts are 
being developed which are active in olefin polymerization. 
Examples of the catalyst are combinations of a 
cyclopentadienyl derivative of a metal such as titanium, 
zirconium, and hafnium (Group 4B of Periodic Table) with 
aluminoxane. (See, for example, J. Boor: "Ziegler-Natta 
Catalyst and Polymerization", Academic Press, New York 
(1979), and H. Sinn and W. Kaminsky: Adv. Organomet. Chem. 
1899 (1980) ). These catalysts have an ability of forming a 
stereospecific olefin polymer with high catalyst activity.  
 Nevertheless, such catalysts have not been used 
industrially mainly because of the following reasons: the 
aluminoxane cannot readily be produced in a reproducible 
form, hindering preparation of the catalyst and the 
polymer with required reproducibility, and the expensive 
aluminoxane has to be used in a considerably high ratio to 
the transition metal compound to achieve sufficient 
activity. To offset the above disadvantages, JP-A -3-207704 discloses an ionic metallocene 
compound prepared by reacting a metallocene with an 
ionizing ionic compound. PCT Patent Application WO 
92/01723 discloses a process of α-olefin polymerization by 
use of a catalyst system prepared by reacting a 
halogenated metallocene with an organometallic compound 
and then bringing the reaction product into contact with 
an ionizing ionic compound. This catalyst system is 
advantageous in olefin polymerization. However, when 
ethylene and α-olefin are copolymerized by use of such a 
catalyst at a high temperature, the resulting copolymer 
disadvantageously has a low molecular weight. JP-A -60-217209 
discloses production of a high-molecular-weight 
olefin polymer by use of a catalyst comprising a hafnium 
compound as the metallocene component. In 
copolymerization of ethylene with α-olefin,
