<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an automatic station for 
the housing of punnets in containers, comprising a 

transport device of the containers (2) for 
positioning them when empty in the station, and 

for removing them when filled, as well as a punnet 
(5) transport device (4), for transporting the 

punnets (5) inside the containers (2) and a 
movement device (6) of the punnets (5) inside the 

containers (2), such that the punnets (5) are 
housed in an ordered fashion in the containers 

(2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an automatic station for
packing baskets in packing containers.An automatic station of this kind comprises according to
US-A-1 954 842 means for transporting the articles on which
groups of packages can be arranged for being located inside a
container carton via an operation of the means for transporting.According to US-A-4 785 611 in an automatic station for
housing articles in a container means for relocating the articles
in fixed order in vertical direction inside the container are
provided. In the packing chain for fruit and vegetable
products, one of the last operations consists in
filling the packing containers, which will then be
despatched to sales outlets.Usually cartons or crates used as containers come
in standardised sizes and have their edges, at
least on the shorter sides, folded internalwise.Since there exists a relation between carton size
and basket size, a predetermined number of food
baskets is housed in each carton.Since the cartons have folded shorter sides, the
baskets are housed in the carton by hand, first by
pushing baskets into the edge and corner portions,
then by progressively working towards the centre
of the carton. This takes up valuable time and
requires care on the part of the operative so that
nothing is damaged and wasted not least because
the baskets are very full with product and must be 
tightly housed in the carton.The present invention aims to obviate the abovementioned
drawbacks, by solving the problem of
automation in the housing operation of the baskets
in the cartons.One of the advantages obtained with the present
invention is that the packing operation times of
the baskets are considerably reduced: the final
results are also better in relation to manually
packed baskets, since a tighter and more efficient
final packing result is obtained.Further characteristics and advantages of the
present invention will better emerge from the
detailed description that follows, of an
embodiment of the invention, illustrated in the
form of a non-limiting example in the accompanying
drawings, in which:
figure 1 schematically shows the invention in a
frontal perspective view;figure 2 shows the invention in lateral view;figure 3 shows the invention in plan view from
above;figure 4 shows the invention in a frontal perspective view
during its work.As can be seen in the figures, the invention
relates to an automatic station 3 for housing food
baskets in packing cartons, comprising a package 
transport device 1 which deposits the empty
cartons 2 at a filling
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An automatic station for housing baskets in
container cartons, comprising a transport device

(1) for the cartons (2) to position said carton
(2) in a filling station, and to remove the

cartons (2) once filled, means for transporting
(4) the baskets (5) to be packed inside the

cartons (2), the automatic station (3) being
characterized in that it comprises means for

relocating (6) the baskets (5) inside the cartons
(2) in a predeterminate ordered fashion, while

the means for transporting (4) the baskets (5) are
not operating. 
An automatic station as in claim 1, characterised
in that the transport device (1) of the cartons

(2) comprises a first pusher (7) to nudge one
empty carton (2) at a time into a filling position

and a second pusher (8) to remove the carton (2)
once it has been filled; the pushers (7, 8) being

activated by a first sensor (9) signalling that
the carton (2) has been completely filled. 
An automatic station as in claim 1, characterised
in that the means for transporting (4) the baskets (5) inside

the cartons (2)
comprise a principal body (16) and a mobile

rigid appendage (10) which passes from a first
position wherein it is completely extended in

order to bring a basket (5) into a position at a far
side of a carton (2), to a second position wherein

it retracts to deposit a basket (5) in a near side
of the carton (2), with respect to the principal body (16)

of means for transporting (4) the baskets (5).
An automatic station as in claim 1, characterised
in that the means for relocating (6) the baskets (5) inside

the cartons (2) comprise a
raised vertically mobile frame (11) provided with

at least one transversally mobile fin (12)
associated to a pneumatic cylinder (13); said

pneumatic cylinder moving the mobile fin (12).
An automatic station as in claim 1, characterised
in that the means for transporting (4) the baskets (5)

is mobile such as to pass from a first
completely extended position in order to bring a

basket (5) into a position at a far side of a carton
(2), to a second position wherein it retracts to

deposit a basket (5) in a near side of the carton 
(2), with respect to

a principal body (16) of the means for transporting (4) the
baskets (5).
An automatic station as in claim 3, characterised
in that the principal body (16) and the mobile

appendage (10) of the means for transporting (4) are
covered by a moving belt (17) associated to a gear

reducer (18); said gear reducer (18) moving the
principal body (16) and the mobile appendage (10);

the appendage (10) being independently associated
also to means (19) for extending it.
An automatic station as in claim 3, characterised
in that it comprises a second sensor (22) to

signal a number of baskets (5) which have
transited and to control the extensions and

retractions of the appendage (10).
An automatic station as in claim 4, characterised
in that the frame (11) is provided with two

transversally mobile fins (12, 14), one of said
fins (12) being asociated to a first pneumatic

cylinder (13) dedicated to moving the fin (12), a
second of said fins (14) being associated to a

second pneumatic cylinder (15) which moves the
second fin (14) together with the first fin (12) 

and the first pneumatic cylinder (13).
An automatic station as in claim 6, characterised
in that the means (19) for extending the appendage

(10) comprise a mobile pneumatic cylinder (20)
equipped with alternating motion and bearing a

rigid structure (21) comprising at least two
rollers (24) for redirecting the moving belt (17).
