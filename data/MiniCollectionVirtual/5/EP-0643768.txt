<ABSTRACT>
Clones (SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, and SEQ ID NO:3) have been isolated and sequenced. An antisense construct has been made from part of SEQ ID NO:1 that blocks opioid binding in cells and has been used to produce transgenic animals having a reduced sensitivity to narcotic analgesics. The oligonucleotide sequence introduced into the animals at an embryonic stage was the first about 500 base pairs, but was reversed in direction. Oligonucleotide constructs of the invention are also useful as probes or as therapeutic and diagnostic agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
 OLIGONUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCES ANDTRANSGENIC ANIMALS TRANSFECTED THEREWITHHAVING REDUCED SENSITIVITY TO NARCOTIC ANALGESICSField of the InventionThis invention generally relates to opioid receptors, and more particularly to oligonucleotide constructs that can be used to produce a transgenic non- human animal, such as rodents, with reduced sensitivity to narcotic analgesics, used as probes or used in therapeutic treatment and diagnoses of narcotic addicts. This invention was made with government support under Grant Nos. DA00564, DA02643, DA01583, awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in this invention.Background of the InventionA μ-opioid-specific receptor protein was purified to apparent homogeneity with a molecular weight of 58,000 daltons in 1986. Cho et al., Proc. Natl . Acad. Sci . USA, 83 (1986), pp. 4138-4142. However, this protein from rat brain exhibited high binding activity only when it was reconstituted with certain lipids. The role of the lipids is presumably to stabilize a particular conformation of the protein. Hasegawa et al., J. Neurochem. , 49 : 4 (1987), pp. 1007-1012. Poly- clonal antibodies were reported as having been raised against the purified opioid receptor from bovine brain. Roy et al., Biochem. & Biophy. Res. Comm. , 150 : 1 , 

 (1988) , pp. 237-244. Monoclonal antibodies were raised against the purified opioid receptor protein, and data suggested that the protein may have significant af inity for and 5, and to a certain extent, against K ligands. Roy et al. , Biochem. & Biophy. Res. Comm. , 154 : 2 (1988), pp. 688-693; Roy et al. , in Biochemical Pharmacology — A Tribute to B.B. Brodie, ed. Costa, E. , New York: Raven Press, Ltd. (1989), pp. 177-188.In 1989, the purified opioid-binding protein from bovine brain was characterized by cDNA cloning. The primary sequence of the protein was deduced from the cDNA clones, with the sequence being found homologous to various members of the immunoglobulin protein super- family, especially to those molecules involved in cell adhesion. Schofield et al. , The EMBO Journal , 8 : 2 (1989) pp. 489-495.Summary of the InventionIn one aspect of the present invention, a DNA segment corresponds to newly discovered clones. This DNA segment is prepared so as to be in the antisense direction. The product of DNA construct hybridizes with endogenous mRNA for an opioid binding protein, and is useful within a cell (cultured or in a transgenic animal) in reducing sensitivity to narcotic analgesics.
