<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
peptides which have hemoregulatory activities and can be
used to stimulate haematopoiesis and for the treatment
of viral, fungal and bacterial infectious diseases.A variety of regulatory messengers and
modifiers such as colony stimulating factors,
interferons, and different types of peptides are
responsible for the regulation of myelopoiesis.

Over twenty years ago, Rytomaa and Kivieniemi Cell
Tissue Kinet 1:329-340 (1968); Rytomaa et al., Control
of Cellular Growth in Adult Organisms pp 106-138 (1967)
reported that extracts of mature granulocytes
(granulocytic chalone) could specifically inhibit rat
myelopoietic cell proliferation in cover slip cultures. 
Later, they demonstrated that the factor, which had a
molecular weight less than 3,000 daltons, was able to
induce the regression of a transplantable rat
granulocytic leukemia, as well as retard the growth of
leukemia cells in humans. Paukovits and others
extracted a similar factor from rat bone marrow cells
and showed that it inhibited the titrated thymidine
uptake of bone marrow cells, Paukovits, W.R., Cell
Tissue Kinet 4:539-547 (1971); Naturforsch 37:1297
(1982). In 1979, Boll et al., Acta Haematologica 6:130
(1979) demonstrated the inhibitory effects of rat
granulocytic extracts on human bone marrow cells in
culture and a number of other researchers demonstrated
that this crude granulocytic extract inhibited the
development of g-CFUC and/or gm-CFUC in vitro from
rodent bone marrow cells.This biological agent was termed a granulocyte
chalone which, according to this theoretical concept,
should be an endogenous inhibitor of cell proliferation
acting in the same tissue as it was secreted. The
material obtained from crude extracts was found to be
non-species specific but highly tissue specific.
Furthermore, it was found to be nontoxic and to have
reversible activities.In 1982, a synthetic hemoregulatory
pentapeptide was reported to have a selective inhibitory
effect on myelopoietic cells both in vitro and in vivo,
where the main effect seems to be on myelopoietic stem
cells (CFU-gm), Paukovits et al., Z. Naturforsch 37:1297
(1982) and U.S. Patent No. 4,499,081. This peptide is
believed to be an analogue of a naturally occurring
granulopoiesis
