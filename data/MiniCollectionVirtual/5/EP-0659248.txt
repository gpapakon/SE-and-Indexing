<ABSTRACT>
A novel design of a driving unit with a motor is disclosed, in particular for motor vehicles, as well as a variator for use with such a driving unit. The variator (6b) has a superposition gear (62) with which a supplementary superposed power can be added to or taken out of the drive, for example to maintain the speed of rotation constant when the motor output varies.

<CLAIMS>
Drive unit, in particular for vehicles, with an intemal combustion engine (1) and with a
motor shaft (2) driven by it, this [motor shaft]
 driving an auxiliary aggregate (5) via an
infinitely adjustable variable speed device (variator) which has an input shaft (7a),

and via an overdrive gear (62) which has an output shaft (7b) as well as at least three
revolving elements (67/68, 69, 63) which interact with one another; with the variable

speed unit supplying to the overdrive gear a controlled overdrive output, or with the
overdrive gear supplying a controlled overdrive output back to the variable speed

unit, with a first revolving element (67/68) being connected with the motor shaft (2)
via the input shaft (7a) of the variable speed unit in a driving manner, with a second

revolving element (69) driving the output shaft (7b) and thus the auxiliary aggregate
(5), and with a third revolving element (63) acting together with a further shaft (65) of

the variable speed unit, in such a way that through the overdrive output, depending
on a control device which is controlled via control criteria, a rotational speed is

provided for the driven auxiliary aggregate (5), characterised in that the further shaft
of the variable speed unit is designed as an output shaft (65) for connecting a further

auxiliary aggregate.
Drive unit in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that the further auxiliary
aggregate is a generator.
Drive unit in accordance with claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the further auxiliary
aggregate is a charger (59). 
Drive unit in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
overdrive gear is a planetary gear with a sun wheel (69), a ring gear (63), and at least

one planet wheel (68) provided on a planet carrier (67).
Drive unit in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
variable speed unit is designed with electrical materials, preferably in the form of a

generator/motor arrangement.
Drive unit in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
variable speed unit is designed with hydraulic materials, preferably in the form of a

pump/motor arrangement.
Drive unit in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
variable speed unit is designed as a variable V-belt (wrap-around) drive.
Drive unit in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the
control device, which is preferably designed hydraulically, can be controlled via at

least one control line, preferably an electrical control line.
