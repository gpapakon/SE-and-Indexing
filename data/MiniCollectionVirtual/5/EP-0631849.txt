<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning method with a corresponding device provides, for the blast-cleaning of surfaces (1), in particular fa√ßades, a treatment region (2) with an air curtain (33) and an exhausting device (27-29, 18). The treatment region (2) adjoins, on one side with a contact opening (30), the surface (1) in leaktight fashion and encompasses, on the other side, a working opening (31b) through which the cleaning personnel (9) can guide the blast-cleaning nozzle (10) with visual contact over the surface (1) to be cleaned. The air curtain (33) is configured in such a way along the working opening (31b) that no dust or abrasive escapes from the treatment region (2) through the working opening (31b).

least along a part of a lateral boundary surface, to a

suction device (28-29, 18, 19), the gas or air curtain

particular

c) the suction volume through-put is set, preferably controlled,
in such a manner that it corresponds substantially

always to at least the sum of the uncompressed
volume supply through said gas inlet arrangement and

the jet nozzle, but is preferably larger at least temporarily,
thereby discharging by-padded air and/or further

gas pressed in.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that at
least one physical value, such as pressure and/or a particle

concentration dependent value, is measured within the
treating region (2), preferably near said surface and remote

from said suction device (28-29, 18, 19), the suction
performance and/or said gas flow being controlled as a

function of said at least one measured value.
Method according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that said treating region (2) is displaceable along a substantially

vertical surface, such as a facade wall, its
lateral boundary surfaces (5) sealingly joining said surface

claim 1, which comprises a housing (3) for delimiting a

treating region (2) and at least one operational implement 
(10) for taking particles off a surface (1), said housing

part, by at least three lateral boundary surfaces (5) oriented

transversely to said surface (1), thus, containing
the surface (1) to be cleaned, and at least one suction

surface (31) opposite said surface (1) in such a manner

sight contact by an operator (9), and
a gas inlet arrangement (34, 36 37) is provided, arranged
along at least part of a lateral boundary surface, and

operation opening (31b).
