<ABSTRACT>
Plates to provide a hydrodynamic seal and hydrostatic 
support for plants performing the pickling and/or chemical 

treatment and/or cleaning of metallic strip, the plates 
cooperating at least with the inlet and outlet of the dip 

tanks (11) in which the metallic strip (12) is fed straight 
without diversions within the dip tank (11), the plates 

comprising a first lower sealing plate (15a) and a second 
upper sealing plate (15b), the first (15a) and second (15b) 

plates being distanced from each other vertically to define 
a feed gap (16) for the feed of the metallic strip (12), a 

plurality of holes (17) for injection of the chemical 
solution under pressure being contained in the two opposed 

surfaces (18) of the first plate (15a) and second plate 
(15b), these injection holes (17) being oriented towards the 

inside of the tank (11), at least one of the plates (15a-15b) 
being moved vertically so as to alter as desired the 

height of the feed gap (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns plates to provide a hydrodynamic 
seal and hydrostatic support for plants performing the 
pickling and/or chemical treatment and/or electrochemical 
treatment and/or cleaning of metallic strip, as set forth in 
the main claim. The hydrodynamic sealing plates according to the invention 
are fitted to dip tanks using a low level, or low head, of a 
liquid and employed for the treatment of metallic strip 
passing through in a straight line. The process of pickling has the purpose of removing from 
the surface of steel the non-metallic particles and, in 
particular, the oxides which form on that surface. Pickling is carried out by making the surface of the steel 
cooperate with inorganic acids or salts that attack more or 
less strongly the surface of the steel to be treated. Plants for the pickling or chemical cleaning of metallic 
strip, as described in this invention, are continuous 
dipping plants and comprise at least one tank filled with a 
solution containing the required acid or salt, in which the 
strip is dipped and fed at the desired speed. For practical reasons the dip tanks through which the 
strip is fed substantially straight and horizontally are 
filled only to a modest height, which can also be defined as 
a head, with the acid solution. So as to ensure that the whole surface of the strip is 
lapped by the pickling action, it is necessary to ensure 
that the strip is fully immersed in the solution. For this purpose the technologies of the state of the art  
 
have used tanks in which the strip is made to cooperate with 
the lower surface of immersion rolls, which are at least 
partly sunk in the solution. These immersion rolls thus 
ensure that the whole surface of the strip is dipped in the 
pickling solution. In another type of disclosed embodiment the strip is 
deflected to form a catenary, thereby entailing an increase 
of the volume of the dip tank. So as to obviate problems linked to the drawing action 
which such deflection of the strip might involve, and to 
enable tanks of a modest volume to be used, straight 
pickling plants have been disclosed in which the strip 
slides substantially horizontally in the acid pickling 
tanks, electrolytic acid pickling tanks or neutral 
electrolytic pickling tanks. So as to ensure that the upper surface too of the strip is 
affected by the pickling action, the strip is caused to 
cooperate at both the initial and final parts of the dip 
tank with sealing means, which ensure that the pickling 
solution is kept at a level
