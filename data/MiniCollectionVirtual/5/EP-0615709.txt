<ABSTRACT>
A device for making streaks in hair by means of a streaking dye is characterised by a base plate (4, 104) which can be placed against a person's head as a base for a portion (24) of hair to be treated and by a plate (10, 106) with a perforation pattern worked out in any design, which plate can be placed on the base plate (4, 104) and thus on the portion (24) of hair, can be placed against the head, and onto which streaking dye can be applied. The base plate (4, 104) and the plate (10, 106) with the perforation pattern are of approximately rectangular design and have in each case a side (12, 120) or (14, 124) of concave design to be placed against the head. The base plate (104) and the plate with the perforation pattern designed as an intermediate plate (106) are connected to one another by means of a film hinge (112). The intermediate plate (106) is connected to a covering plate (108) by means of a further film hinge (116) on the side (114) opposite the base plate. The base plate (104), intermediate plate (106) and covering plate (108) can be folded together in a zigzag manner.
