<ABSTRACT>
Saturable absorption, polarization, and retroreflection are integrated into a 
single solid-state optical element (10). The optical element (10) comprises an undoped 

substrate (14) having front and rear surfaces disposed at a predetermined angle. A 
dielectric coating (15) is disposed on the rear surface of the substrate (14), and at least 

one saturable absorber platelet (11) is disposed on the front surface of the substrate 
(14). The saturable absorbing species used in the platelet(s) (11) are either F₂⁻ color-centers 

in lithium fluoride or Cr⁴⁺ dopant ions in one of several suitable host optical 
materials. Linear polarization of the laser beam (13a) is achieved by orienting the input 

face of the optical element (10) at Brewster's angle. The dielectric coating (15) (mirror) 
on the back surface of the optical element (10) provides 100% reflectivity. The optical 

element (10) is a monolithic, simple to fabricate, easy to align multi-functional element 
for use in a laser resonator (12). The optical element (10) provides passive Q-switching, 

discrimination for linear polarization, and laser beam reflection. The mirror 
is an integral part of the optical element (10), and it is easy to align the integrated 

polarizer. By aligning the optical element (10) for retroreflection, the Brewster's angle 
condition is automatically met and optimal polarization discrimination is achieved. The 

optical element (10) improves the quality and efficiency of lasers in which it is 
employed. The present invention is easy to align and reduces the number of optical 

elements in the laser, thereby improving system reliability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to solid-state optical elements, and more 
particularly, to a quasi-monolithic saturable optical element that provides for saturable 
absorption, polarization, and retroreflection in a single solid-state optical element. Each of the individual functions performed by the present invention (saturable 
absorption, polarization, and retroreflection) is generally well known in the art. Saturable 
absorbers are well-known in the art. Brewster's angle orientation for polarization 
selection is well known. Dielectric high reflection coatings can be deposited on substrates 
without difficulty using conventional practices. Although individual devices 
exist that perform each of the above functions, the disadvantages and difficulties associated 
with aligning three functionally different elements are believed to be self-evident. By way of example, U.S. Patent No.4,084,883, entitled "Reflective Polarization 
Retarder and Laser Apparatus Utilizing Same", issued to Eastman et al. discloses a 
reflective polarization layer for a laser element. U.S. Patent No.4,104,598 entitled 
"Laser Internal Coupling Modulation Arrangement with Wire Grid Polarizer Serving as 
a Reflector and Coupler", issued to Abrams discloses a laser having a combined reflector 
and wire grid polarizer. U.S. Patent No.4,875,220 entitled "Laser Tube for Polarized  
 
Laser Emission", issued to Krueger et al., has two integrated laser mirrors, and the 
integrated mirror has a polarizing surface thereon. U.S. Patent No.5,097,481 entitled 
"Gas Laser Having Two Longitudinal Modes of Laser Oscillation", issued to Fritzsche 
et al. is similar to the Krueger et al. patent. U.S. Patent No.5,101,415 entitled "Laser 
Resonator Mirror with Wavelength Selective Coatings on Two Surfaces", issued to 
Kolb et al. discloses a laser mirror having reflective surfaces which operate in first and 
second wavelength modes. In addition to the above-cited patents, prior work relating to solid-state saturable 
absorbers is typified by the following publications. An article entitled "Formation, 
optical properties, and laser operation of F2- centers in LiF", by W. Gellermann et al., 
in J. Appl. Phys., 61, 1297 (1987) investigates the formation conditions, optical properties, 
and lasing behavior of F2- color centers in LiF crystals. An article entitled 
"Phototropic centers in chromium-doped garnets", by L.I. Krutova et al., in Opt. 
Spectrosc (USSR), 63, 695 (1987) discusses the use of chromium-doped garnets as 
passive Q switches.
