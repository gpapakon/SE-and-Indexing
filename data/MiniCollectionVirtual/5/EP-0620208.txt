<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of an acid 
addition salt of a dobutamine compound of the general formula 


wherein 

R
is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and 
n
is 1 or 2, 
 
by reacting a mineral acid - addition salt of a dopamine compound of the 

general formula 

with a ketone of the general formula 

under the influence of a catalytic amount of a base, and in the presence 
of hydrogen and a hydrogenation catalyst,

 
after which the pH of the reaction mixture is adjusted to approx. 6 at 

most and the product is isolated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of acid 
addition salts of dobutamine compounds. N-[3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methylpropyl]-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethylamine, 
generally known under its generic name dobutamine, is 
marketed as its HCl salt for treating cardiac insufficiency. This 
product, as well as its preparation process and pharmacotherapeutic 
properties, is described in British patent specification 1,392,674. The 
preparation process is carried out by a reductive amination of 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)butan-2-one, 
viz. by reacting this ketone with 
homoveratrylamine under reducing conditions (H2, Pd/C). After 
purification, the intermediate so obtained, viz. the trimethyl ether of 
dobutamine, is demethylated under the influence of 48% hydrobromic acid 
in glacial acetic acid, then converted to the corresponding HCl salt, 
and finally purified by recrystallization from 4N hydrochloric acid. In a Japanese patent application, recently published under no. 
04/013652, an improved method of demethylation is described, using 
highly concentrated hydrochloric acid instead of hydrobromic acid and 
thus avoiding the salt-conversion step. Another improvement, viz. in the 
purification of dobutamine.HCl, is described in DDR patent 0153365. The 
conversion of dobutamine.HCl to other dobutamine salts is the subject of 
the European patent applications, published under nos. 0187019 and 
0280461. DDR patent 0153366 relates to a method of preparing dobutamine by 
subjecting 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)butan-2-one together with dopamine.HCl, 
i.e. 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethylamine.HCl, to a reductive amination (H2, 
Pd/C). The monomethyl ether of dobutamine, obtained as its HCl salt, is 
then converted with a solution of ammonia in methanol into the soluble 
free base and, after separation of the catalyst, reconverted to its HCl 
salt. The subsequent demethylation and purification is carried out as 
described above for the trimethyl ether of dobutamine, producing the 
desired dobutamine salt. The advantage of this method, compared to the 
production process described in the above British patent specification,  
 
should reside in the combination of moderate reaction conditions and a 
substantially impurity-free product. The improvements described in the above, more recent patent 
publications, reveal already the problems encountered by performing the 
preparation process as described in G.B. 1,392,674. To avoid the use of 
highly oxidation-sensitive phenolic compounds, this process starts from 
phenyl
