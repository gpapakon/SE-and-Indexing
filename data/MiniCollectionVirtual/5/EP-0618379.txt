<ABSTRACT>
The present buffer element serves for the vibration-damping securing of a baseplate (6) which is provided with retaining holes (5) and bears a drive assembly. The buffer element is composed of a cylindrical supporting pot (1) with a centrally arranged split rivet (2) and a pin (3) which can be driven into said rivet and is intended for anchoring the pot (1) in the hole of a carrier plate (12), and of a centring sleeve (4) which rises above the pot (1) and can be introduced into the retaining holes (5) of the baseplate (6). In order to be able to produce the buffer element inexpensively from hard/resilient plastic, there are integrally formed on the upper border (7) of the supporting pot (1) at least two diametrically opposite supporting lugs (8) which are directed to rise obliquely inwards and terminate at a distance from the centring sleeve (4). In order, furthermore, to ensure a secure hold counter to the supporting direction there are integrally formed on the centring sleeve (4), above the supporting lugs (8) and distributed uniformly on the circumference, at least two obliquely downwardly directed retaining lugs (10) which are configured approximately in the form of half-rings and of which the outer retaining border (11) covers over the inner supporting edges (9) of the supporting lugs (8).
