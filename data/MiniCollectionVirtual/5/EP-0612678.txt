<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mobile inclined ramp having a running gear (4, 5) which is arranged about halfway along the inclined ramp and having a coupling element, which is fastened to one end of the inclined ramp, to enable the inclined ramp to be coupled to a towing vehicle, the coupling element and the towing vehicle perhaps being a drawbar (8) and a floor conveyor unit respectively. The object of the invention is to design such inclined ramps in such a way that the coupling action can be implemented by a single person. To achieve this object, according to the invention the inclined ramp is provided in the end region (7) facing the coupling element with a lifting element (13) for raising and holding the ramp end at coupling height, it being possible for a lifting element to be provided which is arranged at one end and takes the form of a hand winch (13).

Mobile inclined ramp, having a chassis means (4) 
which is disposed substantially halfway along the length 

and is preferably single-axled, a coupling member (8) 
which is disposed in the region of one ramp end for 

coupling the inclined ramp to a towing vehicle, and a 
support (13) for retaining a ramp end at the coupling 

height, characterised in that the support is configured 
as lifting element (13), and in that the coupling member 

(8) and the support (13) are disposed in the region of 
the ramp end (7) which is supported on the roadway (6) 

during the operation of the inclined ramp. 
Ramp according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the lifting element (13) is provided on one side or on 

both sides of the ramp and is mounted on carriers (1) of 
the ramp which extend longitudinally and are situated on 

the lateral ramp edges. 
Ramp according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the lifting element (13) is a hand winch, more 

especially a rack jack. 
Ramp according to claims 1 - 3, characterised in 
that a vertical, plate-like holder (12) is connected to 

the laterally outwardly protruding portions (11) of the 
carriers (1), and the hand winch (13) abuts against the 

holder (12) via a base plate (17), the base plate (17) 
together with the hand winch (13) being mounted on the 

holder (12) so as to be pivotable about a substantially 
vertical axis (18).  

 
Ramp according to claim 4, characterised in that 

a pivotability about substantially 90Â° is accomplishable 
in such a manner that the supporting element (rack 15) 

of the hand winch (13) is pivotable from the 
substantially vertical operative position into the 

substantially horizontal position, i.e. into a position 
in which the supporting element extends substantially 

parallel to the longitudinally extending carriers (1) of 
the ramp. 
Ramp according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the coupling member (8) is a towbar (8), which is 

mounted centrally on the end face and is pivotable about 
a vertical axis from a position orientated 

longitudinally relative to the ramp transversely 
thereto.
