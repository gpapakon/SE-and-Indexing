<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device at signs, whereby 
each sign has display members which include an elongate 

carrier rod (3) of preferably a great length and 
which carrier rod is vertically oriented and provided 

to rotate about a longitudinal shaft, whereby blades 
(6) on a series of display members (2) mounted beside 

each other are adapted to together define various images 
and whereby the carrier rod (3) is provided with retaining 

means (4, 5) through which the blades (6) are 
mounted on said carrier rod (3). For quick and easy mounting 

of the blades (6), at least one upper retaining means 
(4) is mounted at the top of the carrier rod (3) and comprises 

at least one retaining portion with which a corresponding 
retaining portion on a blade (6) can be brought 

in engagement from below in upwards direction (U), whereby 
at least one lower retaining means (5) is mounted down 

below on the carrier rod (3) and comprises at least one 
retaining portion which is designed to permit engagement 

therewith by a corresponding retaining portion on said 
blade (6) after said blade (6) at the top has been brought 

in engagement with the upper retaining means (4) such that 
said blade can not slide out of engagement with the upper 

retaining means (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device at signs, 
whereby each sign has display members which include an 
elongate carrier rod of preferably a great length and 
which carrier rod is vertically oriented and provided 
to rotate about a longitudinal shaft, whereby first 
blades on a series of display members mounted beside 
each other are adapted to together define a first image, 
whereby second blades on said series of display members 
located beside each other are adapted to together define 
a second image, whereby preferably at least third 
blades on said series of display members mounted beside 
each other are adapted to together define at least a 
third image, whereby said first image can shift to said 
second image and preferably to at least one third image 
by rotating the display members and whereby the carrier 
rod is provided with retaining means through which the 
blades are mounted on said carrier rod.  At signs of the abovementioned type, the display members 
are often long - normally 2 m or more. This means 
that one does not reach up to the upper retaining means 
of the carrier rods when a new blade is to be snapped 
in position thereon and it has been necessary to hit 
the upper portions of the blade with a club or similar 
with a long hand grip in order to have the blade to 
snap in position at the top. The necessity to proceed in this way however, is time 
consuming and thus, more costly, particularly if many 
blades - often more than 100 - shall be replaced at each 
sign each time the three images of the sign shall be 
exchanged for new images. The object of the present invention has been to eliminate 
this problem by means of a simple and suitable device, 
which is defined substantially by the characterizing 
features of subsequent claim 1. The device according to the invention permits that one 
from below can bring the blades into engagement with 
upper retaining means instead of snapping the blades 
thereinto, which means that the blades are quickly mounted 
at the top without tools and far above one's own 
reach. The invention will be further described below with reference 
to the accompanying drawings, wherein 
fig. 1 is a front view of a sign with a device according 
to the invention; fig. 2 is a front view of a carrier rod forming part of 
the device of fig. 1 as well as upper and lower retaining 
means;  fig. 3 is a side view of the carrier rod of fig. 2 and 
a blade which is pushed upwards towards the upper retaining 
means; fig. 4 corresponds with fig. 3 and illustrates the
