<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a process for treating wastepaper for paper manufacture, in which process in a first step wastepaper which is composed to a predominant part of collected household waste or from grades A to D from the list of German Standard Grades (in accordance with VDP), is pulped in a pulper or a drum with the addition of deinking chemicals (DC) and the printing ink is detached and dispersed, and in a second step the printing ink particles are removed from the wastepaper stock suspension by means of flotation, a high quality of the fibrous stock is achieved with simultaneous reduction of the expenditure on chemicals and the plant by carrying out the pulping in the pulper in the high-consistency range with a solids consistency of greater than 10%, by carrying out the pulping and the flotation in the neutral range at a pH value between 6.5 and 8.8, without using fatty acids or soaps, and by the deinking chemicals (DC) being composed to a predominant part of nonionic surfactants.

Process for the recovery of waste paper for paper production, in which

in a first stage waste paper, which essentially comprises miscellaneous
domestic products or grades A to D of the German Standard Grades List

(according to the German Paper Industry Association), is repulped accompanied
by the addition of deinking chemicals and the printing ink is

dissolved and dispersed, and in a second stage the printing ink particles
are removed from the waste paper stock suspension by floatation, the

repulping and floatation being performed in the neutral range with a
pH-value between 6.5 and 8.8 without using fatty acids or soaps, preferably

also without using hydrogen peroxide and alkaline salts and solutions,
characterized in that repulping takes place in a pulper or a repulping

drum in the high consistency range with a true density higher than 10% and
that the deinking chemicals substantially comprise nonionic surfactants.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that repulping takes
place in the pulper with a true density of approximately 15%.
Process according to one of the claims 1 and 2, characterized in that
repulping and floatation take place with a pH-value of 7.8.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
nonionic surfactants based on alkyl alkoxylates are used and that the nonionic

surfactants are added in a proportion of 0.03 to 0.25%, preferably
0.05 to 0.1%, based on the in otro furnish.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
floatation is subdivided into a first and a second stage floatation and

that prior to second stage floatation additionally further deinking chemicals
are added in the form of nonionic surfactants.
Process according to claim 5, characterized in that following first
and/or second stage floatation bleaching is carried out.
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that bleaching is
performed in two stages, the waste paper stock undergoing in a first stage

hydrogen peroxide bleaching in the high consistency range with a true 
density between 20 and 30% and in a second stage a sodium hydrosulphite

bleaching in the low consistency range with a true density of approximately
4.5%.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
between repulping and floatation the waste paper stock is initially diluted

to a stock density of approximately 3.5%, then the heavy dirt is separated
by centrifuging and finally the waste paper stock undergoes a multistage

coarse screening.
Process according to claim 5, characterized in that between first and
second stage floatation there is initially a multistage fine screening in a

consistency range with a stock density of less than 1%, that the waste
paper stock is then deckered and dispersed to a stock density of approximately

30% and following dispersion for second stage floatation dilution
again takes place to a stock density of approximately 1%.
Process according to claim 9, characterized in that dispersion is
performed cold, i.e. without the supply of thermal energy.
