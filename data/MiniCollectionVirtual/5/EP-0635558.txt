<ABSTRACT>
A gas oil composition for motor vehicles, with a 
sulfur content lower than 0.2% by weight and with a 

content of aromatic hydrocarbons lower than about 30% 
by weight, contains, as a lubricity improver agent, an 

amount of from 100 to 10.000 ppm (parts per million 
parts by weight) of lower (C₁-C₅) alkyl esters of a 

mixture of saturated and unsaturated C₁₂-C₂₂ fatty 
acids, derived from vegetable oleaginous seeds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
the use of a lubricity improving agent in
a gas oil
composition for motor vehicles (diesel fuel), with a
low sulfur content.Sulfur contained in gas oils (diesel fuels)
constitutes a particularly serious environmental
problem. New regulations have been discussed for long
time at EC level, following other regulations, already
adopted in such geographical regions as California and
Sweden, which considerably limit the sulfur and
aromatics contents in gas oil, which are thought to
contribute to the emissions of polluting substances
(SOx, NOx, particulates and smoke) in diesel engine
exhaust gases.Since 1985 Laws have been passed in California
which limit to 0.05% by weight the allowed sulfur
level in gas oil. Subsequently, in November 1990, EPA
(Environmental Protection Agency), in accordance with
EMA (Engine Manufactures Associations), API (American
Petroleum Institute) and NCFC (National Coalition of
Farm Cooperatives), passed Laws applicable
throughout the whole territory of the United States,
which set limits both to sulfur content and to
aromatics content in gas oil (maximal allowed level
35% by volume). Such regulations went into effect in
October 1991.Owing to a more deteriorated environmental
situation, in California stricter regulations were
passed by CARB (California Air Resources Board), which 
limit the aromatics content in gas oil to 10% by
volume (for large size refineries with a
production capacity of 50.000 DBP) and to 20% (for
small size refineries). These regulations went into
effect on October 1st, 1993. These regulations should
allow the newly manufactured diesel engines to limit
the particulates emissions to 0.10 g/bhph, versus the
presently allowed threshold value of 0.25 g/bhph.As regards the European Countries, Sweden passed
regulations which, through strong tax relief policies,
stimulate the production of ecological gas oils. For
example, for metropolitan Stockholm area, gas oils
have been subdivided into the following classes:
Gas oil typeTotal Aromatics ContentPolynuclear Aromatics ContentSulfurTax ReliefClass 1< 5% v< 0.1% v< 10 ppm35%Class 2< 20% v< 1% v< 50 ppm15%Class 3< 25% v-------<500 ppm0%As regards the European Economic Community, only
a short time ago regulations were passed and turned
into effect, which limit the sulfur content in gas
oils at no more than 0.2% by weight, and stricter
regulations are being discussed at present, which
should go into effect inuring from 1996. Such
regulations should provide for sulfur level to be
limited at

vegetable oleaginous seeds, in an amount of from 100 to 10.000 ppm (parts

per million parts by weight), in gas oil composition (diesel fuel) with a
sulphur content equal to, or lower than about 0.2 percent by weight and with

a content of aromatic hydrocarbons lower than about 30% by weight as a
lubricity improving agent. 
Use according to Claim 1,
characterized in that said alkyl esters of fatty acids

seeds oil.
Use according to CLaim 1,
characterized in that said esters are a mixture of

esters of fatty acids with a C
12
-C
22
 straight chain,
mainly with an even number of carbon atoms in their

molecule, which mixture contains from 5 to 20% by
weight of saturated fatty acids, from 70 to 95% by

weight of total mono-unsaturated and di-unsaturated
fatty acids, and from 0 to 10% by weight of total tri-unsaturated

and tetra-unsaturated fatty acids.
Use according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that said saturated fatty acids are

lauric acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid and said
mono-, di- and tri-unsaturated acids respectively are

oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid.
Use according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the sulfur content in gas oil is

equal to 0.1% by weight, or is lower than this value,
down to complete or substantial absence of said

sulfur.
Use according to Claim 1,
characterized in that said gas oil is a gas oil for

motor vehicles of petroleum origin, or of synthetic
origin, or it may be a gas oil containing a level of

up to about 10% by volume of oxygen containing
compounds, in particular of ether character.
Use according to Claim 7,
characterized in that said gas oil additionally

contains one or more additives selected from among
cetane number improvers and low temperature

characteristics improvers of said oil.
