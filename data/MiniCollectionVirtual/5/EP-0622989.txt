<DESCRIPTION>
A METHOD OF INACTIVATING MICROBES IN BLOOD USING IODINEBackground of the Invention This invention relates to the treatment of biological fluids generally, including such human transfusion blood, serum and plasma and fractions and products thereof, an biological fluids used for diagnostic testing or the production of biologicals for diagnostic tests.Iodine was officially recognized by the Pharmacopeia of the United States in 1930, also as tincture iodine (tincture of iodine) and linimentum iodi (liniment of iodine). Clinicians and microbiologists described a great number of experimental data and clinical applications. Despite the successes that have been achieved with iodine, it was ascertained early that it also possesses properties unsuitable for practical application.Although exact details about the killing of a living cell by the I2 molecule (or one of the reaction products occurring in aqueous solution) are not known, it can be assumed that iodine reacts with basic N-H functions that are parts of some amino acids (e.g., lysine, histidine, arginine) and the bases of nucleotides (adenine, cytosine, and guanine) forming the corresponding N-iododerivatives. By this reaction, important positions for hydrogen bonding are blocked, and a lethal disorder of the protein structure may occur. Iodine oxidizes the S-H group of the amino acid cysteine, through which the connections of protein chains by disulfide (-S-S-) bridges, as an important factor in the synthesis of proteins, are lost. Iodine reacts with the phenolic group of the amino acid tyrosine, forming mono- or diiodo-derivatives. In this case, the bulk of the iodine atom(s) in the ortho position may cause a form of steric hindrance in the hydrogen bonding of the phenolic OH group and with the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) of the unsaturated fatty acids. This could lead to a change in the physical properties of the lipids and membrane immobilization.Iodine - polymer complexes, e.g., with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), and complexes of iodine with nonionic surfactants, eg, polyethylene glycol 

mono(nonylphenyl) ether have been used with considerable success. However, use in direct contact with labile biological materials has been limited because either the killing power of iodine is dissipated in the biological material or damages the biological material. Povidone iodine is capable, in certain circumstances, of killing all classes of pathogens encountered in nosocomial infections: gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, yeasts,

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A process of preparing safe human transfusion blood comprising the steps of separating whole human blood into cell concentrate and plasma, adding oxidizing iodine to the plasma in an amount equivalent to at least 0.001 percent by weight of the blood sufficient to inactivate substantially all microbes in the plasma and cell concentrate, reconstituting whole blood from the thus treated plasma and the cell concentrate, holding the reconstituted blood for a period of greater than about two minutes and solvent extracting the reconstituted blood with a hydrophobic biologically compatible iodine solvent before transfusing the same into a patient.
2. The process of Claim 1 wherein adding oxidizing iodine comprises passing the plasma into contact with solid polymer-iodine complex to add oxidizing iodine.
3. A process of preparing plasma or serum safe for transfusion into a patient comprising the steps of adding oxidizing iodine to said plasma or serum in an amount equivalent to at least 0.001 percent by weight sufficient to inactivate substantially all microbes in such plasma or serum, holding the plasma or serum for a period of greater than about two minutes and solvent thereafter extracting the biological fluid with a hydrophobic biologically compatible iodine solvent.
4. The process of Claim 3 wherein adding oxidizing iodine comprises passing the plasma or serum into contact with solid polymer-iodine complex to add oxidizing iodine.
5. A process of preparing plasma or serum safe for transfusion comprising the steps of adding oxidizing iodine to said plasma or serum in an amount equivalent to at least 0.001 percent by weight sufficient to inactivate substantially all microbes in such plasma or serum, holding the plasma or serum for a period of greater than about two minutes and solvent thereafter reacting the plasma or serum with starch and separating the resulting starch iodine precipitate from the plasma or serum. 


 6. The process of Claim 5 wherein adding oxidizing iodine comprises passing the plasma or serum into contact with solid polymer-iodine complex to add oxidizing iodine.
7. A process of preparing human transfusion blood substitute comprising the steps of separating whole human blood into cell concentrate and producing serum from the plasma in the blood, adding oxidizing iodine to the serum in an amount equivalent to at least 0.001 percent by weight of the blood sufficient to inactivate substantially all microbes in the serum and cell concentrate, reconstituting blood substitute from the thus treated serum and the cell concentrate, holding the reconstituted blood substitute for a period of greater than about two minutes and solvent extracting the reconstituted blood with a hydrophobic biologically compatible iodine solvent before transfusing the same into a patient.
7. The process of Claim 8 wherein adding oxidizing iodine comprises passing the serum into contact with solid polymer-iodine complex to add oxidizing iodine.
8. A process of removing iodine from plasma, serum or other biological fluid comprising reacting the liquid with a solution starch and separating the resulting starch-iodine precipitate from the liquid. 9. A process of removing iodine from plasma, serum or other biological fluid comprising contacting such fluid with solid particles of cross-linked povidone which complexes with the iodine and then separating such particles from such fluid.
