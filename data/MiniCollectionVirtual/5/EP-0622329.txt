<ABSTRACT>
An automatic stabilizing and reinforcing device for 
vehicle raising jacks having an arm (3) with a stirrup (18), at 

least one flat front support portion (20), at least one arm (1) to 
which the jack foot (2) is pivotally connected and a nut (7) in 

which the jack screw (6) is threaded. The device comprises a 
convex member (21), rotatably retained and supported on a 

transverse rod (17) attached to the arm (3) by a hook (23) and by 
respective end flanges (24). The stirrup (18) is pivotally 

supported on the convex member (21) and carries a centre plate 
member (25), located in front of the the stirrup (18) and under the 

flat front support portion (20) thereof. The stirrup (18) is 
likewise provided with a downwardly projecting flap (26) 

attached to the bottom of the plate member (25), in which 
there is mounted a spring (27) attached at the other end 

thereof to the arm (3) and holding the stirrup (18) centered.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is a vehicle raising
jack, such as a "Y" jack, a parallelogram jack with
extended lower leg and the like.Mechanical vehicle raising jacks of various types are
known and, among them, the most important are the
following:
a) the "Y" jack, comprising a column having a ground
support foot and a raising arm pivotally mounted to the
column at an intermediate height thereon and having a
generally channel-shaped end stirrup for supporting the
vehicle. For such purpose the latter has respective
flanges in the proximity of the corresponding edges of
the underside of the bodywork. The said column and arm
are linked together by a screw which is threaded into a
nut pivotally connected crosswise to the top of the
column, while the front end of the said screw is
pivotally and rotatably connected to an intermediate
point of said raising arm (or the nut could be pivotally
arranged on the raising arm and the screw would be
pivotally and rotatably attached to the top of the column
close to the rear end thereof), while the rear end of the
screw is provided with a crank or the like enabling the
user to operate the mechanical arm for raising the
vehicle and thus be able to replace the corresponding
faulty wheel. A jack of this type is described in the
patent DE-U-74-14229.b) Parallelogram jack, having four hingedly connected
arms and a screw arranged on the diagonal thereof. One of
the ends of the screw is threaded in a nut arranged on 
one of the apexes of the parallelogram, with the other
end being attached to the opposite apex, but rotatably. A
portion of the screw juts outwards for operation by a
crank as in the previously described type. In this jack,
the lower apex of the parallelogram has pivotally
attached thereto a ground support plate, acting as a
foot, and the upper apex of said parallelogram has
attached thereto another plate acting as stirrup, for
supporting the corresponding part of the vehicle.c) A jack comprising a mechanism having four hingedly
connected arms arranged in form of a parallelogram,
provided with a screw situated on a diagonal, as in type
b), and which is approximately horizontal when the jack
is in the position of use and which is operated by a
crank or the like. The front end of the screw is threaded
in a nut pivotally mounted to the front apex of the
parallelogram, while the opposite end of the screw passes
through a cross member which is pivotally connected to
the rear apex of the said parallelogram. The rear end of
the screw is terminated in a rear
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vehicle raising jack of the type comprising an arm
(3) having at the end thereof a stirrup (18) for

supporting the vehicle, said stirrup having the form of a
transverse channel with at least one flat front support

portion (20), at least one column (1) to which the jack
foot (2) is pivotally connected and a nut (7) in which

the jack screw (6) is threaded, characterized in that it
is provided with a member (21) upwardly convex in a plane

tranverse to the stirrup bearing arm (3), said member
(21) being capable of rotating relative to a transverse

rod (17) attached to the end of the stirrup bearing arm,
bearing against said rod and being rotatably retained

thereon by at least one hooklike section (23) arranged
around the rod and by respective end tabs (24)

overlapping the corresponding ends of the rod; in that
the stirrup is fitted upon and around the convex member,

with a substantial clearance in transverse planes
relative to the bearing arm thereof and bears on the

convex portion of said member, about which it may rock in
said planes; in that, furthermore, the stirrup has

attached thereto a centre plate member (25) having a
width smaller than the gap between two vertical walls of

the end of the bearing arm (3) thereof, and having a
figure four configuration so as to form a lower tubular

central portion, situated in front of the front wall of
the stirrup channel and below the flat front support

portion (20) thereof, forming a large central recess for
the convex member (21) so that said stirrup may rock

freely relative thereto on the said planes; in that the
stirrup channel is provided with a centre front cut-out

tab (26), extending downwardly and to which there is
attached the lower portion of the plate member, likewise

directed downwardly and arranged below the recess; in
that the end of a central spring (27) is attached to said 

lower portion of the plate member, the opposite end of
which is attached to the stirrup bearing arm, keeping the

latter centered against the convex member (21) in a
preset position; and in that the foot (2) is provided

with a central recess (28) in which there is located the
corresponding lower end of the foot carrying column (1),

which recess is crossed, just above, by a transverse rod
(29) attached to the front end of the foot and to which

said column is pivotally attached, a spring (30) being
arranged between the foot and column.
The vehicle raising jack of claim 1, characterized in
that the upwardly convex member (21) is provided with at

least one downwardly directed protuberance from the
convex portion thereof, which bears on the transverse rod

(17).
