<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus has a latent image
carrier on which a latent image is formed. A developer

carrier conveys a one-component non-magnetic developer and
develops the latent image either in close proximity to or

in contact with the latent image carrier. A voltage
application unit applies an AC-superimposed bias voltage

to the developer carrier. A regulating member abuts
against the developer carrier to regulate the thickness of

the developer layer on the developer carrier. The
regulating member has a semiconductive member provided at

the distal end thereof to produce an electric potential
difference between the semiconductive member and the

developer carrier, to which the AC-superimposed bias
voltage is applied, when regulating the thickness of the

developer layer on the developer carrier, thereby forming
a line-shaped uneven conveying surface. Thus, the

occurrence of banding and longitudinal unevenness and
stripes is prevented, and fogging and scattering are also

prevented. Further, the occurrence of filming is prevented,
thereby allowing formation of a uniform image free from

density unevenness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image forming apparatus for forming an image by developing an electrostatic latent image formed on a latent image carrier. More particularly, the present invention relates to an image forming apparatus designed to reduce the occurrence of density unevenness and stripe-shaped image defects in the formed image.Conventionally, in the one-component non-magnetic development method, toner is supplied onto a developing roller, and the layer of toner on the developing roller is regulated with a regulating blade to a predetermined thickness to form a thin toner layer. Thereafter, a DC bias voltage or an AC bias voltage is applied to the developing roller either in or out of contact with a photosensitive member, thereby causing the toner to adhere to a latent image formed on the photosensitive member. Thus, the latent image is developed to form the desired image. In general, the developing roller in this type of image forming apparatus is driven through a gear train. Hence, the drive of the developing roller becomes unavoidably intermittent owing to the backlash in the mesh of the gears, causing feed irregularities to occur on the developing roller. Consequently, the thickness of a toner conveying surface formed on the developing roller becomes nonuniform in the circumferential direction. As a result, density unevenness (banding) occurs in the feed direction. Further, when the thickness of the toner layer on the surface of the developing roller is regulated with the regulating blade, toner is likely to clog in the nip between the developing roller and the regulating blade. For this reason, the thickness of the toner conveying surface formed on the developing roller may become uneven in the axial direction, resulting in an image containing longitudinal strip-shaped unevenness or longitudinal stripes. This causes the image quality to be degraded.In contact development, the developing roller is brought into contact with the photosensitive member to perform development. In the contact development, toner may adhere to a non-image area, causing fogging. Further, blur may occur in a halftone image owing to disconnection, thickening or scattering of thin lines of the image. When printing is performed continuously, toner may adhere to the developing roller to give rise to a problem known as filming. This causes the toner transferability and chargeability to change, resulting in image quality degradation.In non-magnetic color AC jumping development, an AC-superimposed bias voltage is
