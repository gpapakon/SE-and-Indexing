<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a red phosphorus 
flame retardant in fine powder form and a nonflammable 
resinous composition flameproofed with the flame retardant 
and having improved stability. Red phosphorus is known as a flame retardant for 
synthetic resins. Red phosphorus flame retardants produced 
by the surface modification treatment of powdered red 
phosphorus with various kinds of inorganic or organic 
compounds and nonflammable resinous compositions containing 
these flame retardants are known in a large number. 
Disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,242,240, 4,315,897, 4,421,728, 
and 4,440,880 respectively are a red phosphorus flame 
retardant treated with a phenol-formaldehyde polycondensate, 
one treated with aluminum hydroxide and an epoxy resin, one 
treated with titanium dioxide or titanium phosphate, and one 
treated with a melamine condensate. The surface modification 
treatment is conducted in order to improve the chemical 
stability of red phosphorus and improve the usefulness 
thereof as a flame retardant. As is well known, red phosphorus is an unstable 
substance and undergoes a disproportionation reaction with  
 
moisture and oxygen to decompose and thus generate phosphine, 
which is harmful to the human body. It is further known that 
the decomposition products other than phosphine adversely 
affect properties of the flameproofed resin and corrode the 
mold for use in molding the resin. The surface modification treatment serves to reduce 
the generation of such harmful substances by coating the 
surfaces of the red phosphorus particles with a chemically 
stable inorganic or organic compound to inhibit the 
disproportionation reaction. One of the reasons for the instability of powdered 
red phosphorus is the shape of the red phosphorus particles 
which is attributable to the process for the production 
thereof. The powdered red phosphorus on the market is 
obtained by heating white phosphorus (the terms "white 
phosphorus" and "yellow phosphorus" are used interchangeably) 
in a closed vessel for a long time to convert it into red 
phosphorus and wet-grinding the resulting solid mass of red 
phosphorus after completion of the conversion reaction, as 
described in Kirk-Othmer, "Encyclopedia of Chemical 
Technology" 2nd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1968, 
Vol.15, p.286. Since the pulverizing step is indispensable 
and the contour of each particle of the powdered red 
phosphorus is constituted by split-off surfaces having many 
active sites, the particles are so reactive that
