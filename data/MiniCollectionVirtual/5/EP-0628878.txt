<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for making a lithographic 
printing plate according to the silver salt diffusion transfer 

process using a photographic material comprising on a support a 
silver halide emulsion layer and a layer containing physical 

development nuclei comprising the steps of: 

image-wise exposing said photographic material and 
developing a thus obtained image-wise exposed photographic 
material by guiding said image-wise exposed photographic material 

through an alkaline processing liquid in 15s or less; 
 
characterized in that said alkaline processing liquid comprises a 

hydrophobizing compound having a mercapto group that has a pK
a
 of 
4.5 or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making a 
lithographic printing plate according to the silver salt diffusion 
transfer process. The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal 
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described e.g. in 
US-P 2, 352, 014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion 
Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London 
and New York, (1972). In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an 
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer 
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into 
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into 
an image-receiving element and are reduced therein with a developing 
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to 
form a silver image having reversed image density values 
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the 
exposed areas of the photographic material. A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic 
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the 
water-repellant ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive 
ink-repellant background. A particular interesting type of 
photographic material for making a printing plate according to the 
DTR-process comprises in the order given on a support a silver 
halide emulsion layer and a physical development nuclei containing 
layer as a surface layer. Such type of photographic material is 
commercially available under the tradename of SUPERMASTER from Agfa-Gevaert 
NV and from Mitsubishi Paper Mills under the tradename 
SILVERMASTER. These commercial printing plates are generally processed by 
means of camera plate makers that include an exposure unit as well 
as a developing unit. Development of the photographic material in 
most camera plate makers takes place by soaking the photographic 
material in a developer tank holding developing liquid and 
subsequent soaking the photographic material in a fixing tank  
 
holding a neutralizing liquid. These tanks are large volume tanks 
typically holding about 5 liters of processing liquid. An important disadvantage of such large tanks is that the 
processing liquids deteriorate due to oxidation and processing of 
photographic material. Consequently there is a need for frequent 
replacement of the processing liquid which is inconvenient and time 
consuming. EP-A-482479 discloses a developing unit wherein the volume of 
the tanks is reduced to about 0.5 liters.
