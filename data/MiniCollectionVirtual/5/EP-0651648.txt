<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides use of interleukin-6 in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of consumptive thrombohemorrhagic disorder. The invention also provides use of interleukin-6 in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of a dysfunction associated with a reduced level of at least one acute phase protein.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the novel use of certain
cytokines in the treatment of certain blood disorders,
primarily consumptive thrombohemorrhagic disorder.Consumptive thrombohemorrhagic disorder comprises
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),
defibrination syndrome and consumptive coagulopathy. A
consumptive thrombohemorrhagic disorder is a pathological
syndrome, the manifestation of which can in large part be
regarded as a consequence of thrombin formation although
other features such as blood factor and platelet
consumption and fibrinolysis are present. Thrombin
catalyses the activation and subsequent consumption of
certain coagulant proteins and production of fibrin
thrombi or clots. The fibrin thrombus is seen as an
indicator of DIC. Microvascular, non adherent thrombi
are present in almost all cases of DIC.The symptoms of consumptive thrombohemorrhagic
disorder such as DIC vary with the stage and severity of
the consumptive thrombohemorrhagic disorder. Most
patients have extensive skin and mucous membrane bleeding
and hemorrhage from multiple sites. Occasionally
patients have abnormalities in laboratory tests without
clinical manifestations. The major manifestations in
laboratory tests include thrombocytopenia, prolonged
prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin
time (APTT) and thrombin time (TT) and a reduced
fibrinogen plasma level illustrating the consumption of
essential coagulation factors. Elevated fibrin
degradation products (FDPs or fibrin split products)
account for intense secondary fibrinolysis. Other
factors such as factors V, VIII and XIII are usually
decreased. Such findings can strengthen the diagnosis.
In particular lowered factor VIII levels may be a
sensitive indicator. However, the major manifestation of
DIC, which correlates closely with bleeding, is the 
reduced plasma fibrinogen level. Normally, there is a
fine balance in blood between clot-forming and clot-dissolving
factors as will be explained in more detail
below.Heretofore, the treatment of consumptive
thrombohemorrhagic disorder has been based on the
correction of any reversible cause of consumptive
thrombohemorrhagic disorder, on measures to control the
major symptoms i.e. bleeding and/or thrombosis, and on
prophylactic regimens to prevent recurrence of the
causes. Treatments vary according to the cause and the
clinical presentation but the major issue is the control
of bleeding and thrombosis which are often associated.
Accordingly, the clinician may supply the patients with
plasma coagulation

<CLAIMS>
Use of a natural, synthetic or recombinant form of interleukin-6 or a
derivative thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or

prophylaxis of consumptive thrombohemorrhagic disorder in which the disorder
is primary fibrinolysis.
Use as claimed in claim 1 in which said consumptive hemorrhagic
disorder is caused by liberation of tissue factors, endothelial damage, vascular

malformations or infections.
Use as claimed in claim 2 in which said infection is accompanied by septic
shock.
Use as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which said medicament is
in dosage unit form, each unit containing 35 to 350 µg of interleukin-6 per dose.
A use as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which the interleukin-6
is administered intravenously at a dose level of 0.5 to 30 µg/kg body weight/day.
A use as claimed in any of the preceding claims in which the interleukin-6
is administered parenterally or by a delayed release formulation at 0.02 to 1.25

µg/kg body weight/hour.
