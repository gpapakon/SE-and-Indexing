<CLAIMS>
Heat resistant or refractory brick for use as a tin 
bath base brick in installations for manufacturing 

plate glass by the float method, characterised in 
that the brick comprises calcium aluminate in coarse 

and fine granular form and a bonding agent of 
calcium aluminate. 
Brick as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that 
the granular material of the brick comprises 

sintered or fused calcium aluminate. 
Brick as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that 
the granular material is porous. 
Brick as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that 
it is present in the form of a hydraulically bonded, 

dried, shaped body fired at elevated temperature. 
Method of manufacturing the cement-bonded heat 
resistant or refractory brick as claimed in Claim 1, 

characterised in that a mixture of calcium aluminate 
of grain size 0.1 - 3 mm and fine grained calcium 

aluminate of grain size below 0.1 mm in an amount of 
10 - 30 wt.%, with respect to the ceramic, oxide 

starting material containing the calcium aluminate, 
is mixed with the addition of water, shaped, stored 

in a moist environment, dried and fired. 
Method of manufacturing the brick as claimed in 
Claim 5, characterised in that the proportion of the 

fine grained calcium aluminate of grain size less  
 

than 0.1 mm is 15 - 25 wt.%. 
Method of manufacturing the brick as claimed in 
Claim 5, characterised in that a calcium aluminate-containing 

oxide starting material is used which 
contains 20 - 60 wt.% CaO, 40 - 80 wt.% Al
2
O
3
 and at 
most up to 10 wt.% FeO, Fe
2
O
3
, SiO
2
, MgO, TiO
2
. 
Method of manufacturing the brick as claimed in 
Claim 7, characterised in that the content of SiO
2
 
and iron oxide, calculated as Fe
2
O
3
, is in each case 
less than 1.5 wt.% in the oxide starting material 

containing calcium aluminate.
