<ABSTRACT>
A porous sintered body is composed of a 
perovskite-type composite oxide, wherein A-site of the 

composite oxide are occupied by one or more kinds of 
first metallic elements selected from the group 

consisting of calcium and strontium, one or more kinds 
of second metal elements selected from the group 

consisting of rare earth elements and yttrium excluding 
lanthanum and cerium, and lanthanum, the above one or 

more kinds of the first metallic elements amount to 5 to 
70 mol% of the A-sites, and manganese is contained in 

B-sites of the composite oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to porous sintered
bodies and solid oxide fuel cells using such porous
sintered bodies as air electrodes.In developing solid oxide fuel
cells (SOFC), it is important to discover materials
stable at high temperatures. As a material for air
electrodes of the SOFC, lanthanum manganite sintered
bodies have now been considered promising (Energy General
Engineering, No. 13, Vol. 2, pp 52-68, 1990). As such
lanthanum manganite sintered bodies, some having almost
chemically stoichiometric compositions or others having
manganese-rich compositions in which no elements are
present in a part of the A-sites (to be occupied by lanthanum),
are known. It is reported that the lanthanum manganite
sintered body having the composition in which no elements
are present in a part of the A-sites decreases its weight
as the temperature rises from room temperature to 1000°C
(J. ELectrochem. Soc. vol. 138, No. 5, pp 1519-1523, 1991). 
In this case, the weight of the sintered body begins to
decrease from near 800°C. In particular, a porous
sintered body composed of lanthanum manganite doped with
Ca or Sr at the A-sites is considered promising as a
material for air electrodes including self-supporting
type air electrode tubes. See EP-A-467 590 and EP-A-395
399, and also EP-A-593 281 (published 20.04.94).However, the present inventors have first found
out that there exist the following problems with respect
to such a porous sintered body. That is, it was
clarified that when a SOFC unit cell with this porous
sintered body is subjected to heating-cooling cycling
(heat cycling) between a temperature range of 900°C to
1100°C as a power-generating temperature range of the
SOFC and a temperature range of room temperature to
600°C, cracking occurs between the air electrode made of
the above porous sintered body and other constituting
materials of the unit cell to break the unit cell.In addition, on the other hand, even if the
above unit cell was operated at 1000°C for an extended
time period, such cracking did not occur at all.
Therefore, it is considered that the above cracking
phenomenon is caused not by firing shrinkage of the
porous sintered body but by dimensional change due to
dimensional changes in the heat cycling.In order to solve the above problem, NGK 
Insulators, Ltd. proposed a technique that the
dimensional shrinkage caused by the above heat cycling
between room temperature and 1000°C is reduced by
replacing a part of lanthanum atoms at the A-sites of the
lanthanum manganite porous sintered body
