<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a process 
for treating and sizing paper substrates with 
an isocyanate. In particular, the present invention 
is concerned with a process for strengthening and 
sizing paper with an isocyanate characterized in 
that the isocyanate does not contain water and is 
applied to paper by means of an electrostatic spraying 
device. The treatment of paper with isocyanates has 
been disclosed. For example, a process for treating 
paper with isocyanates is disclosed in EP-A-140537. 
In US-A-4,505,778, a process for 
applying a size of an aqueous emulsion of an aromatic 
isocyanate to a wet paper web is disclosed. 
However, neither patent discloses a process in which 
isocyanates are electrostatically sprayed onto paper. Isocyanates emulsified with water have been 
applied to paper using a size press and unemulsified 
isocyanates have been applied using a rotogravure 
coating machine. When conventional means of spraying 
isocyanates are used, they are characterized by 
low transfer efficiencies. As a result, significant 
amounts of isocyanate are released into the atmosphere, 
thereby creating potential health problems. 
In addition, when the isocyanate that is applied to 
paper is not sprayed, solvent diluted, or emulsified, 
it is very difficult to apply the isocyanate 
at levels below 5 to 10 percent by weight based upon  
 
the weight of the paper. Lower isocyanate levels 
can be achieved by using emulsified isocyanates. 
However, pot life problems with the isocyanate can 
arise when the isocyanates are emulsified because 
the water begins to react with the isocyanate 
groups. Furthermore, depending upon when in the 
process the emulsion is added, it can result in 
additional drying requirements. There is therefore 
a need for a process for efficiently applying isocyanates 
to paper substrates at levels below 5 percent 
by weight based upon the weight of the paper substrates 
and a process that does not utilize emulsified 
isocyanates, although emulsifiable isocyanates 
may be used. Surprisingly it has been found that these needs 
can be met by using an electrostatic spraying device 
to apply isocyanates to paper. By using this electrostatic 
spraying device, transfer efficiencies 
above 90 percent can be achieved and the isocyanate 
can easily be applied to paper substrates at levels 
well below 5 percent by weight. The amount of 
isocyanate needed according to the invention can be 
as low as 0.5 g/m². However, in commercial production 
settings, the amount of
