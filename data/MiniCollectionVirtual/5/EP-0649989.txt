<ABSTRACT>
Improved blind rivet assembly comprising a hollow, 
flanged rivet body (3) and a headed drawing mandrel (5) in which the 

mandrel is provided with raised, multi-start helix (6) at least 
along its stem remote from the rivet (7). The multi-start helix (6) 

form may also be provided along that part of the mandrel 
stem (5) adjacent the flange of the rivet body (3). The multi-start 

helix (6) has at least four, preferably eight, starts and the 
raised helix form has a height of at least 0.05 mm above the 

diameter of the mandrel stem. The raised helix (6) is formed on 
the mandrel (5) after assembly, say by a rolling operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blind rivet assembly
comprising a hollow, flanged, tubular rivet body and a
headed mandrel which is set by pulling the headed mandrel by
means of a setting tool so that the head causes the rivet
body to flare against the flange (DE-A-2 360 159). Further pulling then
applied to the mandrel causes the mandrel to break at a
predetermined weakened region near the head and continued
pulling enables the mandrel to be removed from the rivet.
The setting tool includes gripping jaws with serrated teeth
which dig into the mandrel stem. If the teeth are filled
with debris, then slippage can occur which impairs the
effectiveness of the tool, even resulting in failure to set
the rivet.The grip of a setting tool on a mandrel can be enhanced
by the provision of grooves in the mandrel but the mandrel
may be seriously weakened thereby. This may cause the
mandrel to break prematurely if, for example, the difference
between the rivet setting load, governed by the depth of the
weakened portion of the mandrel stem under the head, and the
mandrel stem break load is small.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
blind rivet assembly wherein the mandrel is provided with
enhanced grip for the setting tool without weakening the
mandrel.According to the present invention, we provide a blind
rivet assembly comprising a hollow flanged rivet body and a
headed, drawing mandrel, characterised in that the mandrel
comprises a first stem section adjacent to the head of the
mandrel and enclosed within the rivet body and a second
exposed stem section extending from the end of the first 
stem section remote from the head, which second stem section
is provided with a raised, multi-start helix form. By
"multi-start" helix we mean a helix with at least four,
preferably eight, starts. Preferably the raised helix form
has a height of at least 0.05 millimetres above the diameter
of the mandrel stem. The multi-start raised helix form may
also be provided on that part of the mandrel stem adjacent
the flange of the rivet body.The raised helix form is applied to the mandrel stem
after assembly and further to the present invention we
provide a method of producing a blind rivet assembly by
assembling a hollow flanged rivet body with a headed drawing
mandrel characterised in that after assembly the headed
mandrel is subjected to a treatment whereby a multi-start
helix form is raised at least in that part of the mandrel
stem remote from the rivet body.The treatment of the mandrel stem may be effected by a
