<ABSTRACT>
A tower crane consists of a two-piece jib with trolley (23), a rotary platform (4) preferably located at the top end of the tower, and a spire (7) with a counter jib (6). The jib is linked to the tower and consists of a jib articulation piece (5) and a jib extension piece (5'). So that a tower crane of this type can be put into its operating position quickly and simply and can subsequently be put back into its folded transport position, the lifting mechanism (10) and the trolley travel drive (11) are arranged on the jib articulation piece (5). A jib tip (30) consisting of a girder (29) and having the lifting rope (20) and the trolley deflection sheave (37) is firmly fastened to the outer end of the jib extension piece (5'). After its connection is released, the jib tip (30) can be moved over jib extension piece (5') onto the jib articulation piece (5).
