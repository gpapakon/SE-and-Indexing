<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording/reproduction apparatus of an 
azimuth system for recording/reproducing a digital signal 

by helical scanning a magnetic tape (8) has a SP mode and 
a LP mode having recording/reproducing time period N (N is 

an even number) times that of SP mode. The apparatus 
includes a pair of magnetic heads (7a, 7b)
 with opposite 
azimuth, disposed in close proximity on a circumferential 

face of a rotary head cylinder 5 with difference in level 
therebetween corresponding to a predetermined track pitch 

t for scanning simultaneously two continuous tracks at 
that pitch. The cylinder is rotated at the same rotation 

speed in both SP and LP modes, while the tape travel speed 
is reduced to 1/N that of SP mode when LP mode is 

specified. When LP mode is specified, the data amount of 
a digital signal to be recorded is compressed to 1/N that 

in SP mode, which are provided to the magnetic heads 2-channel 
record data, and the data amount of reproduced 2-channel 

digital signals of is expanded by N. In SP mode, 
recording/reproduction is carried out by every 2 

continuous tracks by the pair of magnetic heads for every 
1 rotation of the cylinder. In LP mode, 

recording/reproduction is carried out in a unit of 2 
continuous tracks by the pair of magnetic heads for every 

N rotations of the cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
recording/reproduction apparatus including a long play
mode, and more particularly, to a helical scan system
magnetic recording/reproduction apparatus that can record
and/or reproduce analog or digital information in a long
play mode in addition to a standard play mode.In the field of conventional digital magnetic
recording/reproduction apparatuses that record and/or
reproduce digital information using a helical scan and
azimuth recording/reproduction system, research efforts
are expended on employing a long play mode (referred to as
LP mode hereinafter) in addition to the standard play mode
(referred to as SP mode hereinafter) as
recording/reproduction modes. The potential of such a
long play mode is discussed in, for example, "A Study on
Long Time Mode Recording for Home Use Digital VTR",
Proceedings of National Conference of Institute of
Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers of
Japan, 1-382, Spring, 1990. In such a digital magnetic 
recording/reproduction apparatus, recording and
reproduction of high definition television broadcasting
having a great amount of information is desired in
addition to the recording and reproduction of the current
NTSC system and PAL system television broadcasting.
However, a specific structure is not yet known for
realizing both the SP mode and the LP mode, or for
recording/reproducing various broadcasting differing in
amount of information by a conventional digital magnetic
recording/reproduction apparatus.A conventional digital magnetic
recording/reproduction apparatus generally has two
magnetic heads 2a and 2b with opposite azimuth mounted on
the circumferential face of a rotary head cylinder 1, at
locations apart by 180° from each other, as shown in Fig.
1. The attached manner of the magnetic heads to a
cylinder is basically similar to that in a VTR of a
general VHS system. In the drawing, the positive symbol
"+" indicates the azimuth of head 2a (referred to as
azimuth A hereinafter), and the negative symbol "-"
indicates the azimuth of head 2b (referred to as azimuth B
hereinafter).According to the structure shown in Fig. 1, heads 2a
and 2b helical-scan a magnetic tape (not shown)
alternately for each half rotation of cylinder 1 by 
rotating cylinder 1 at a constant speed while winding and
running the magnetic tape around cylinder 1 at a
predetermined angle in recording/reproduction operation.Particularly in a recording/reproduction operation of
the SP mode, the travel speed of the tape is controlled so
that
