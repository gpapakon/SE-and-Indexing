<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed towards a protein comprising 
two p40 subunits of interleukin-12 which are associated together, 

preferably by at least one disulfide bond, having a molecular weight 
of about 80 kDa. The 80 kDa p40 homodimer acts as an interleukin-12 

receptor antagonist. The preferred p40 subunit is that of SEQ ID NO:1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a protein of two associated p40
subunits of interleukin-12 acting as an interleukin-12 receptor
antagonist.Interleukin-12 (IL-12), formerly known as cytotoxic
lymphocyte maturation factor (CLMF) or natural killer cell stimulatory
factor (NKSF), is a cytokine that has pleiotropic activities including
stimulation of the proliferation of activated T and NK cells (1, 2),
induction of INF-Î³ production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells
and enhancement of the lytic activity of NK/LAK cells (2-4).IL-12 is a heterodimeric molecule with an approximate
molecular weight of about 75 kD consisting of two disulfide-linked
subunits: p35, having an approximate molecular weight of about 35
kD, and p40, having an approximate molecular weight of about 40 kD,
(2, 4-6). The p40 subunit shares amino acid sequence homology with
the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) and therefore belongs to the
cytokine receptor superfamily, whereas p35 has a distant but
significant relationship to the IL-6/G-CSF cytokine family. It has been
speculated that the p35/p40 heterodimer could represent a cytokine
(p35) and soluble cytokine receptor (p40) complex, with the cellular
IL-12 receptor providing function analogous to the IL-6 signal
transducing protein, gp130 (7, 8).The biological activity of IL-12 is mediated by the binding of
the intact IL-12 molecule to plasma membrane receptors on activated
T or NK cells (9,10); however, the contributions of the individual
subunits to receptor binding and signal transduction remain unknown.
Studies with neutralizing antibodies to human IL-12 (11) and site-specific
chemical modification (12) suggested that the p40 subunit
contains epitopes important for IL-12 binding to its receptor. Also, 
studies with human/mouse chimeric molecules indicated that p35 is
responsible for the species specificity of the heterodimer for biological
activities.Figure 1. Dose-response binding of human IL-12 and COS-expressed
rp40 to KIT225/K6 cells analyzed by flow cytometry.
Varying concentrations of purified human IL-12 or rp40-containing
conditioned medium (determined by EIA (enzyme immunoassay)
using IL-12 as standard) were incubated with KIT225/K6 cells and
detected with biotinylated 8E3 mAb followed by streptavidin-PE as
described in the Materials and Methods. Panel A: curve a represents
nonspecific staining of cells incubated only with biotinylated-8E3 and

and 500 ng/ml of human IL-12, respectively. Panel B: curve a
