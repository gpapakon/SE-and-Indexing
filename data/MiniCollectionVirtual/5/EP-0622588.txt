<ABSTRACT>
The circumferential shut-off air channel (3) designed as a flap stop in the pipe housing is divided into several channel sections (7) which form expansion joints (8) between same. These sections (7) are attached to the channel housing (2) with a predetermined motion play in the longitudinal direction. The expansion joints are bridged with sealing action by internal pipe sections (9) which are inserted in the channel sections and are each fixed on one of the two sections forming each joint (8). The channel sections can have angled connecting flanges attached by screws (13) through oblong holes onto holding flanges on the channel housing.

A shut-off device for ducts with large cross-sections, in particular for waste
gas- and flue gas ducts of power plants, with a duct housing (2), which is

provided with an interior insulation, with a surrounding shut-off air duct (3)
constructed as a flap stop, with shut-off air blow-out openings (4) arranged

distributed around its periphery and with a swivellably mounted shut-off
flap (5) with a surrounding double seal (6) for the blowing in of shut-off air

when the double seal (6) is pressed against the shut-off air duct (3) in the
closed position of the flap, wherein the shut-off air duct (3) is divided into

shut-off air duct sections (7), the shut-off air duct sections (7) form
expansion joints (8) between each other, the shut-off air duct sections (7)

are connected to the duct housing (2) with given play in their longitudinal
direction by means of angled connection flanges (11) the expansion joints

(8) are bridged by elements (9) having sealing effect and being inserted
into the shut-off air duct sections (7) and the elements (9) are each

secured on one of the two shut-off air duct sections (7) forming the
respective expansion joint (8),

characterised in that each shut-off air duct section (7) is composed of two

shut-off air duct parts (18, 19), each of which has a connection flange (11),
in that the connection flanges (11) are connected to holding flanges (14)

fastened to the duct housing (2), with given play of movement and under
forming of a closed shut-off air duct section (7) by the two shut-off air duct

parts (18 and 19) in such a manner that the connection - and holding
flanges (11, 14) are substantially embedded in the interior insulation (15),

in that the elements (9) have the form of inner tube sections and in that the
double seal (6) is arranged on the shut-off flange (5) as an edge-running

seal.
A shut-off device according to claim 1,

characterised in that the shut-off air duct (3) is divided to form the shut-off
air duct sections (7) adjoining the shut-off air duct corners (10) and/or in

the central region of its lengthwise and breadthwise sides and the shut-off
air duct corners (10) are fixedly connected with the duct housing (2). 
A shut-off device according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that connection flanges (11) have oblong holes (12)
extending in the longitudinal direction of the shut-off air duct sections (7)

and are connected by means of fixing screws (13) to the holding flanges
(14), in which the fixing screws (13) penetrating the holding flanges (14)

and the oblong holes (12) of the connection flanges (11) are tightened with
a given tightening torque.
A shut-off device according to one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that the shut-off air ducts sections (7) are composed in
each case of L-shaped and Z-shaped shut-off air duct halves (18, 19)

forming a box-shaped cross-section of the duct and two parallel
connection flanges (11), and that the two connection flanges (11) hold

between them the respective holding flange (14)
A shut-off device according to one claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that the fixing screws (13) are inserted with supporting
discs (16) covering the oblong holes (12).
A shut-off device according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that the external cross-section of the inner tube sections
(9) is adapted to the internal cross-section of the shut-off air duct sections

(7).
A shut-off evice according to one of claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that the expansion joints (8) are bridged by metal foil
strips (17) of given width surrounding the shut-off air duct sections (7)

externally with a close fit.
A shut-off device according to one of the claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that the metal foil strips (17) are clamped in the region of
the connection- and holding flanges (11, 14) by means of the fixing screws

(13).
