<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the compounds of formula (I): 
<

>
  in which   Ar: represents a phenyl or naphthyl group, Ar being unsubstituted or substituted by one or a number of radicals chosen from halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy and trifluoromethyl,   n: represents 0 or an integer from 1 to 4,   B: represents a group

 , and   A: represents a group of formula (A1) or (A2): 
<
IMAGE
>
  in which:   E: represents a linear or branched alkylene chain containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms; R1: represents a radical chosen from hydrogen, hydroxyl, lower alkyl and lower alkoxy,   R2: represents a radical chosen from hydrogen, lower alkyl and 
<

 where E1 has the same definition as E as described above and where R4 and R5 are chosen, independently of one another, from hydrogen and lower alkyl or together form, with the nitrogen atom which carries them, a heterocycle chosen from pyrrolidine, piperidine, substituted piperidine, morpholine, piperazine and substituted piperazine,   R3: represents a radical chosen from hydrogen and lower alkyl, and   X: represents a sulphur or oxygen atom,   to their optical isomers and to their addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable base or acid, and to their use as medicaments.
