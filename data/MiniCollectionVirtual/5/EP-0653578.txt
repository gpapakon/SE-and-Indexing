<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a method of forming a
hydraulic damper. By hydraulic damper is meant a
suspension strut or shock absorber.A hydraulic damper for use in the suspension
system of a motor vehicle typically comprises a tube;
a piston sealably slidably mounted in the tube and
attached to a piston rod, the piston separating a
compression chamber from a rebound chamber within the
tube; a compression stroke valve mounted on the piston
which allows fluid flow from the compression chamber
to the rebound chamber; and a rebound stroke valve
mounted on the piston which allows fluid flow from the
rebound chamber to the compression chamber. The
piston rod extends out of the tube at one end thereof,
and is sealably slidably mounted in that one end.
Such hydraulic dampers either comprise an inner tube
and an outer tube (sometimes referred to as a twin
tube damper) in which the piston sealably slides in
the inner tube, or comprise a single tube (sometimes
referred to as a monotube damper).It is usual practice to form the or each
tube of a hydraulic damper by rolling a sheet of steel
and welding together the adjacent longitudinal edges.
External parts, such as the spring seat and the
mounting bracket or steering knuckle, which are also
formed from steel, are then welded to the single tube
or the outer tube. The other end of the tube is
sealed closed by welding on an end plate or by
arc-heating and rolling the tube end, and the internal
components of the suspension strut (such as those
mentioned above) are inserted into the tube by way of
the one end thereof, which is then sealed closed. The
use of several welding steps has disadvantages in that 
welds are time consuming operations. Further, welds
are susceptible to corrosion. Still further, the use
of steel has disadvantages with regard to weight.DE-A-4129644 discloses a method in
accordance with the preamble of claim 1.It is an object of the present invention to
overcome one or more of the above mentioned
disadvantages.A method of forming a hydraulic damper in
accordance with the present invention comprises
extruding a tube of aluminium or aluminium alloy;
forming a spring seat of aluminium or aluminium alloy;
positioning the spring seat on the extruded tube; and
closing an end of the extruded tube by flame heating
the end of the extruded tube and rolling the flame
heated end.This invention removes the steps of welding,
thereby removing time consuming operations. Further
the use of aluminium or aluminium alloy has advantages
with regard to weight when compared
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a hydraulic damper
(10) comprising extruding a tube (12) of aluminium or

aluminium alloy; forming a spring seat (50) of
aluminium or aluminium alloy; and positioning the

spring seat on the extruded tube; characterised by
closing an end (28) of the extruded tube by flame

heating the end of the extruded tube and rolling the
flame heated end.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein
the spring seat (50) is formed by pressing.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein
the spring seat (88) is formed by casting.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 3, wherein the spring seat (50) is formed with a

cylindrical section (52) which overlies a portion of
the extruded tube (12) on positioning the spring seat

on the extruded tube.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 3, wherein the spring seat (88) is formed with an

inner cylindrical section (90), an outer annular
portion (92), and a number of spokes (94)

interconnecting the cylindrical section and the
annular portion.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 5, wherein the extruded tube (86) is formed with

one or more external longitudinally extending ribs
(96,98) which engage with corresponding grooves

(100,102) formed in the spring seat (88) to locate the
spring seat on the extruded tube in a predetermined

position.
A method as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 5, wherein the spring seat is integrally formed

with a cap for closing the other end of the extruded tube. 
A method as claimed in Claim 4 or Claim
5, wherein an external circumferential
ly extending
bead (48) is formed in the extruded tube (12), and the

spring seat (50) is slid onto the extruded tube until
one end (54) of the cylindrical section engages the

bead.
A method as claimed in Claim 4 or Claim
5, wherein the spring seat is slid onto the extruded

tube, and an external circumferentially extending bead
is formed in the extruded tube adjacent one end of the

cylindrical section.
A method as claimed in Claim 8 or Claim
9, wherein a second external circumferentially

extending bead (56) is formed in the extruded tube
(12) adjacent the other end of the cylindrical section

(52) to retain the spring seat on the extruded tube.
A method as claimed in Claim 4 or Claim
5, wherein the spring seat (60) is slid onto the

extruded tube (12), and at least one external
circumferentially extending bead (62) is formed in the

extruded tube and the cylindrical section (64).
A method as claimed in Claim 6, wherein
the or at least one of the ribs (96,98) is cut to

define a shoulder (106), and wherein the or at least
one of the grooves (100,102) is formed with a

corresponding shoulder, the spring seat being slid
onto the extruded tube until the shoulders engage to

locate the spring seat on the extruded tube in a
predetermined position.
