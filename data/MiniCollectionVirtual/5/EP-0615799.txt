<ABSTRACT>
A laser process machine 12 is disposed in front of a 
progressive die 3 in a press machine 1 in the feeding 

direction of material 9 to be processed. The head 13 of 
the laser process machine 12 is adapted to move at least in 

two directions such as the feeding direction and the 
transverse direction of the material to execute the 

accompanying processes such as a forward end cutting off 
process A or a process of making dummy holes 15 in the 

material to be processed 9. The accompanying process can 
be performed without unwanted deformation of the material 

9 allowing the material 9 to be fed into the progressive 
die 3 steadily.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of processing a 
material to be processed by a press machine provided 
therein with a progressive die, and an apparatus for the 
processing. In known processes, material to be processed is fed 
from an uncoiler and processed by a progressive die of a 
press machine. This process is supplemented by various 
kinds of accompanied processes, for example, joining the 
material to be processed with new material to be processed 
so that the material is contiguously fed to the press 
machine. An accompanied process, is described in Japanese 
Patent Laid-open No. HEI 4-94828. While a forward end of 
the material to be processed is fed to a pull-roll feeding 
apparatus disposed at the releasing side of the press 
machine, dummy holes which are bigger than processing 
portions for a phased processing of the progressive die are 
punched out in the material to be processed at equal pitch 
on the front side of the progressive die along a feeding 
direction of the material to be processed. Thus the 
material to be processed is not processed at the respective 
processing portions during the phased processing. 
Therefore, it will not be necessary for a person engaged in 
the progressive process to transfer the forward end of the 
material to be processed manually until the forward end 
thereof reaches the pull-roll feeding apparatus. Furthermore, other accompanied processes include a 
forward end cutting process for cutting the forward end of 
the material to be processed to obtain a fine-finished 
forward end of the material to be processed, a forward end 
tapered-off process for cutting off both corner portions of 
the forward end to feed the forward end smoothly into the 
progressive die, and a process for making pilot relief 
holes to position the material to be processed by  
 
corresponding pilot pins in the main process by the 
progressive die. In addition, there is also provided a 
cutting process for cutting the material to be processed 
after the designated numbers of the pressed products are 
obtained by the main process with the progressive die. In Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. HEI 
4-94828 as mentioned above, a so-called dummy die is 
provided in front of the progressive die in the feeding 
direction of the material to be processed to punch out the 
dummy holes in the material to be processed. In this case, 
the process of punching the material to be processed causes 
deformation such as warpage and dimensional disorder of the 
pitch when making pilot relief

<CLAIMS>
A method of processing a material, the method 
comprising a main process step of progressive processing of 

a material (9) which is progressively fed through a press 
machine (1) using a progressive die (3) which is provided 

in the press machine; and an accompanied process step for 
processing the material by a laser process machine (12) 

which is arranged in front of the progressive die in the 
feeding direction of the material. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the accompanied 
process step includes at least one process among a process 

(A) for cutting a forward end of the material (9), a 
process (B) for cutting off both corner portions (9B) of 

the forward end of the material (9), a process for making 
a pilot relief hole (16) in the material (9), and a process 

for making in the material a dummy hole (15) the dimensions 
of which are bigger than each processing portion (5-8) 

provided in the progressive die (3), which are performed 
before the main process step; and a process for cutting the 

material (9) and a process for joining the material (9) to 
a new supply of material, which are performed after the 

main process step. 
A method according to claim 2, wherein the accompanied 
process step is to make in the material (9) a dummy hole 

(15), the dimensions of which are bigger than each 
processing portion (5-8) provided in the progressive die 

(3) at a position remote from the first processing portion 
by an integer times the pitch (P) defined between adjacent 

processing portions (5-8) provided at equal pitch in the 
progressive die along the feeding direction of the 

material. 
A method according to claim 2, wherein the accompanied 
process step is to make pilot relief holes (16) in the 

 
material (9) at a position remote from a punch (10B) making 

pilot relief holes, at a portion where the material to be 
processed is fed into the progressive die (3), by an 

integer times the pitch (P) defined between pilot pins 
(10A) and the punch (10B) provided at equal pitch in the 

progressive die along the feeding direction of the 
material. 
An apparatus for progressively processing a material, 
comprising a press machine (1) having a progressive die (3) 

for processing material (9) which is fed into the press 
machine; a laser process machine (12) which is disposed in 

front of the progressive die (3) in the feeding direction 
of the material, the laser process machine being provided 

with a head (13) for irradiating a laser beam which 
processes the material, the head being adapted to move at 

least in two directions. 
An apparatus according to claim 5, wherein a drive 
device for moving the head (13) in the two directions 

contains a control mechanism having a program for 
controlling the head.
