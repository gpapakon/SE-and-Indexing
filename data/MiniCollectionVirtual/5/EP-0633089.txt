<ABSTRACT>
A diffusion apparatus 32 for use with a spraybar 20 used in, for example, 
supplying an inerting gas such as nitrogen into a process chamber. The 

apparatus comprises a sleeve 30 of mesh material 34 for providing around 
the spraybar 20. The mesh material may be single layered or multi-layered 

in which case it could be spirally wound or formed into concentric sleeves. 
In operation, the sleeve acts to further diffuse the gas emanating from the 

spraybar thereby to provide the diffusion performance similar to an 
expensive and easily broken sintered spraybar without the back pressure 

problems associated therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid distribution apparatus and relates 
particularly, but not exclusively, to a diffusion apparatus for introducing 
an inerting gas into an enclosure used in, for example, wave or reflow 
soldering equipment. Patent application No GB 9121003.9 discloses a typical soldering apparatus 
including a soldering chamber as illustrated in Figure 1. A conveyor 
conducts circuit boards to be soldered through the chamber in which they 
come into contact with melten solder and are thus soldered where necessary. 
The chamber is provided with a plurality of spraybars for supplying 
non-oxidising gas such as nitrogen into the chamber to create therein a 
relatively non-oxidising soldering atmosphere. The spraybars commonly comprise sintered stainless steel tubes having a 
small pore size. In operation, the inerting gas permeates through the 
poles and is distributed in a non-directional manner. Such tubes whilst 
being able to perform their function admirably well are comparatively 
expensive to produce and, due to their sintered nature, are easily broken 
in use. In addition, as they are partially sintered products with a small 
pore size they create an appreciable back pressure in the gas delivery 
system. Also known are standard spraybars which comprise an elongate tube having a 
plurality of holes drilled therein. The inerting gas is diffused by simply 
spraying it through the holes and thereby mixing it with the contents of 
the enclosure. This arrangement whilst not suffering from the problem of 
back pressure is somewhat directional and is unable to diffuse the gas 
rapidly, and can therefore, be less efficient than is desired. It is an object of the present invention to provide a diffusion apparatus 
which reduces and possibly eliminate the problems associated with the above 
mentioned spraybars. Accordingly the present invention provides a diffusion apparatus for use 
with a spraybar comprising a tube having a plurality of holes provided 
therein for the passage of a fluid therethrough, the diffusion apparatus  
 
comprising a sleeve for fitment over said spraybar and having a plurality 
of holes greater in number than the holes in the spraybar over which in 
operation it is fitted. It will be appreciated that the comparatively large number of holes 
provided in the sleeve will act to further diffuse any fluid exiting the 
holes in the spraybar without substantially affecting the back pressure of 
the overall apparatus. For convenience and in order to produce a finer
