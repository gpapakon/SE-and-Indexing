<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for treating contaminated, e.g. oily, water 
including a floating skimmer (3) for skimming the surface 

of the contaminated water (2). The contaminated water 
from the skimmer is fed to a hydrocyclone (6) for 

separation of the water and contaminant. The hydrocarbon 
rich stream from the hydrocyclone undergoes further 

separation using a spear (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the treatment
of water contaminated with products, in particular
hydrocarbon or petroleum products such as oil and petrol,
but also contaminants such as tallow, vegetable oil, and
light solid plastic or other particles. Such contaminated
water may include run off water from a petroleum storage,
loading or transferring station, or from any other source
where a contaminated water run off is anticipated, for
example in carparks, chemical plants, oil refineries,
machine shops, abbertoirs and the like.In known processes, contaminated water may be
collected from a source area potentially containing
contaminants, and stored in a receptacle. The
contaminated water may then be either allowed to flow
directly into open drains or sewers, or more usually be
treated to remove as much of the contaminant as possible
before the water stream is allowed to leave the site.
Such treatment processes for cleaning water contaminated
with oil or petrol generally involve pumping the
contaminated water into an above ground tank or vessel,
which contain a series of parallel plates or baffles
which allow the oil droplets in the water mixture to rise
to the surface of the vessel under the normal action of
gravity settling, from where the oil is generally skimmed
from the top and into a drum or other storage container
for later removal from the site. The cleaner water stream
is generally allowed to enter the open drains or sewers.
These vessels are generally of a category called Plate
Separators, or Corrugated Plate Interceptors, (CPI).There are a number of difficulties and dangers with
the Plate Separator and CPI type systems, the result of
which is that the water quality produced is often not of
an acceptable level to be safely or legally discharged
into open drains or sewers, and may contain enough 
residual petroleum or other inflammable contaminant to
produce a potentially explosive mixture in the presence of
an ignition source, or be a pollutant to the environment.US-A-3743102 discloses an apparatus for treating water
contaminated with a lighter contaminant, the apparatus
comprising a floating skimmer for skimming the surface of
the contaminated water, and a cyclonic separator to which
the contaminated water from the skimmer is fed for at least
partial separation of the water and contaminant; and
according to the present invention, such an apparatus is
characterised by a second separator, to which a contaminant
rich stream from the overflow of the cyclonic separator is
fed for further

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for treating water contaminated with a
lighter contaminant, the apparatus comprising a floating

skimmer (3) for skimming the surface of the contaminated
water, and a cyclonic separator (6) to which the

contaminated water from the skimmer (3) is fed for at least
partial separation of the water and contaminant;

characterised by a second separator (8), to which a
contaminant rich stream from the overflow (7) of the

cyclonic separator (6) is fed for further separation, the
second separator comprising a spear (8) comprising a first

generally upright tubular member (13) having a coupling
(15) for connection to a vessel (16) and an inlet (14) for

the contaminant rich stream from the cyclonic separator (6)
to pass through the first tubular member (13) and downwards into the

vessel (16); and a second tubular member (19)
provided within the first

tubular member (13), and extending below the first tubular
member to such an extent that, in use, it opens into the

lower region of the vessel (16) in which region the water
settles, said second tubular member having an outlet (20) for

separated water in the upper section.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the cyclonic
separator is a hydrocyclone (6).
An apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein a
recycle line (11) is provided from the underflow outlet (9)

of the cyclonic separator (6) to a receptacle (1) in which
the contaminated water is contained.
An apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims, further comprising an air driven pump (4) for

pumping the contaminated water from the skimmer (3) to the
cyclonic separator (6). 
An apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the pump (4)
is a diaphragm pump.
An apparatus according to claim 4 or claim 5, wherein
the pump (4) is arranged so that its exhaust discharges

into a receptacle (1) in which the contaminated water is
contained.
An apparatus according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the apparatus is provided on a trolley.
