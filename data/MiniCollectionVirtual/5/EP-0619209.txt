<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle braking system comprising at least 
one brake control channel comprising a controller responsive to wheel speed 
signals from at least two wheel speed sensors, for sensing skid conditions of at 
least two wheels and for generating skid control instructions, a plurality of wheel 
brakes responsive to fluid pressure, hereinafter referred to as brake pressure, 
supplied thereto, a supply means, comprising a common supply valve, for 
supplying brake pressure to said brakes from a fluid pressure supply in accordance 
with a brake operating signal and a skid control means controlled by said skid 
control instructions for controlling the brake pressure in a plurality of cycles each 
of which comprises a pressure reduction phase and a pressure increase phase and 
may also comprise a pressure hold phase between the pressure reduction and 
increase phases. For example, the or each channel may comprise two wheels at opposite 
ends of a common axle or may comprise two wheels at the same end of different 
axles. The wheels may be of any type, e.g. driven, steered or load carrying. When a "split co-efficient of friction situation" arises, i.e. when one wheel 
of a channel system is engaged with a surface having a co-efficient of friction 
which is higher (higher friction surface) than the co-efficient of friction of a 
surface with which another wheel is engaged (lower friction surface), it has been 
known to select one of the wheels as the wheel which controls the operation of 
the skid control means. If the wheel engaged with the or a lower friction surface 
is selected (known as "select low mode") then, when the brakes are applied, the 
skid control means is operated, in dependence on the controller detecting a skid 
condition of the wheel engaged with the lower friction surface, to cause the 
common supply valve to control brake pressure to reduce the braking effect on 
all the wheels of the channel. Where the channel comprises more than two wheels  
 
normally the skid control means is controlled by the wheel engaged with the 
lowest friction surface, i.e. the first wheel to skid. However, if desired, any 
surface other than the highest friction surface may be selected if desired and such 
surface is referred to herein as the lower friction surface. In a select low mode the controller controls the brake pressure of the 
wheels in accordance with skid conditions of the wheel engaged with the lower 
friction surface. This causes a reduction in the braking effect of the wheel(s)
