<ABSTRACT>
By applying the offset sampling using four-plane 
prism provided with four solid state imaging devices at 

four light output planes, chromatic aberration of lenses 
is eliminated even to the peripheral part of the imaging 

plane, and moire suppression effect is much enhanced. 
Furthermore, by using a plural number of matrix circuits, 

and by producing the luminance signal by changing the 
matrix ratios in low frequency range and in high frequency 

range, moire suppression effect is further enhanced, and 
luminance error is also eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video camera
using solid-state imaging devicesThe resolution of a video camera using a solid
state picture imaging device is determined by a number of
pixels of the solid state imaging device used therein.
Improvement of the resolution of a solid state imaging
device can be realized by increasing the number of pixels
of the solid state imaging device. However, increasing of
the pixel number while keeping the imaging size of the
device constant results in a reduction of the size of
individual pixels, and it introduces lowering in its
important performance characteristics such as sensitivity
and dynamic range. Therefore, the improvement of
resolution of a solid state imaging device by adapting the
increase of pixel number was feasible only in the extent
that the sensitivity and the dynamic range obtainable from
the device could fulfill the performance required for a
video camera.Heretofore, in order to obtain a high resolution
capability using a solid state imaging device having a 
limited number of pixels, the RGB offset sampling has
widely been investigated. The detail is described in "3
CCD Camera Scheme" (Television Gakkai Gijutsu Hokoku
(Technical Report of Japan Television Engineering
Institute), ED-395, authors: Yamanaka, Yamazaki,
Hashimoto, Abe, Ochi, published on 28, Sept., 1978).In the following, explanation is given on the
configuration of the RGB offset sampling scheme and
problems thereon.The basic configuration comprises a three
primary color prism, three solid state imaging devices
respectively for green channel, blue channel, and red
channel. At the three primary color prism, setting-positions
of the solid state imaging devices for the red
channel and for the blue channel are taken to be offset by
an amount of half pitch of the horizontal pixel pitch in
the horizontal direction with respect to the setting-position
of the solid state device for the green channel
in reference to its optical image. As a result of the
above-mentioned offset, for the luminance signal which is
obtained by combining respective color channel signals,
the number of sampling points upon an optical image
becomes effectively increased, and thereby the moire is
suppressed and hence a high resolution is gained.In the RGB offset sampling scheme, there are two
problems. First one is that, in the peripheral part of an
imaging plane of a solid state device, due to the chromatic
aberration of lens, the above-mentioned moire
suppression capability is no longer available. As one of
the
