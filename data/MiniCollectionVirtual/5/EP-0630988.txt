<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) 
copper films deposited onto either conducting metallic or insulating 
surfaces. In the electronics industry there is a steady trend towards 
manufacturing integrated circuitry of increasingly higher speed and larger 
information storage capacity. This requires the individual electrical devices 
such as transistors, etc. within the integrated circuitry to be fabricated at 
an increasingly small scale. The metallic electrical interconnects between 
the devices also need to be miniaturized. As device and interconnect 
dimensions approach one-half to one-quarter of a micron, the choice of 
interconnect metal becomes critical. The large current densities resulting 
from small interconnect cross sectional areas can lead to major problems such 
as electromigration, stress migration and voiding where the metal lines become 
fractured or otherwise physically degraded under operating conditions, a major 
drawback with aluminum alloys. Metal interconnects also need to provide the 
lowest electrical resistance path possible since resistance-capacitance delays 
become a dominant factor in circuit performance at sub half micron levels. 
The aluminum that is widely used in present day interconnect manufacturing is 
reasonably conductive (2.7 microhm cm), but needs to be alloyed with 0.5 to 
4.0% Cu to minimize the electromigration tendencies of the pure metal. 
Tungsten, also widely used, is electromigration resistant but is of higher 
resistivity (5.4 microhm cm). Considering these facts, copper should be an 
excellent interconnect metal as it is both highly conductive (1.7 microhm cm) 
and electromigration resistant. Metallic interconnects are typically horizontal lines (runners) or plugs 
(vias) that wire together devices in microprocessors. At feature sizes of > 1 µm 
(micron) these metallic components can be built into the microcircuits by PVD 
(Physical Vapor Deposition) techniques such as sputtering or evaporation. In 
essence PVD consists of condensing a metal vapor onto a surface  
 
or channel of a circuit where an electrical connection needs to be formed. 
Since this is a non-selective metallization, either a postdeposition clean-up 
(i.e. etch-back) or a predeposition masking of the substrate (i.e. the lift-off 
technique) is required in order to prepare individual discrete metal 
components. However, the severe surface topographies presented by sub-micron 
features preclude the effective use of PVD since this "line of sight" 
technique
