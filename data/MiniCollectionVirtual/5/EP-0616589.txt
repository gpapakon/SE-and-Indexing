<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved bottle cap
device and more particularly to a bottle cap that is formed
having a positive sealing arrangement for use with bottles that
store gaseous liquid such as carbonated beverages and other
materials such as foods. The bottle cap device includes a cap
body and a sealing cover or lid that is formed having a depending
semi-spherical sealing member that engages a gasket mounted
within the cap body each time the cover is locked closed.Many types of cap devices are presently in use and they vary
in configuration and how they are capped on a bottle. This is
generally due to the configuration of the bottle in which the
soda is stored. Some known soda-bottle caps are just simple
plastic snap-on units or caps having internal threads that match
particular bottle arrangements and these caps have no particular
sealing arrangement. Both of the types of caps do not provide
proper sealing to prevent gases within the soda water from slowly
leaking out. When the gas is allowed to escape from the bottled
soda it is no longer desirable since it becomes what is referred
to as "flat".Therefore, such bottle caps generally have inherently poor
sealing qualities. This is particularly true with bottle caps
that are mounted to the larger 2 liter soda bottles commonly sold
in markets, liquor stores, drug stores and like places. These
bottles are often provided with soft aluminum caps that are
fixedly sealed to the thread outlet neck portion of the bottle.
This type of cap is removed from a bottle by rotating the cap so
as to force it to break loose from an integrally formed holding
ring member. Many times, the soft metal caps are distorted by
the force required to remove them, causing the cap to lose its
circular shape which then prevents it from being properly sealed, 
and allows the gases to leak out of the bottle.Accordingly, there is a need for a sealing cap that is
simple to operate and yet provides a very positive seal when
remounted to a threaded neck portion of a 2 liter plastic bottle
or other container.US-A-5,031,784 discloses a bottle cap device according to the preamble of claim 1. The present invention is characterized by the features of the characterizing portion of claim 1.The present invention comprises a novel bottle cap or cover
member that is hingedly mounted to a cap body that is internally
threaded so as to be readily secured to any compatible threaded
neck portion of a bottle containing soda or other materials. The
capping lid or cover is formed having an

<CLAIMS>
A bottle cap device including a cap body member
(22) and lid member (40) for sealing gaseous liquids or

other materials stored within a bottle (10) having a
threaded neck portion (12), the cap body member having an

annular wall (24) with an inner surface, the inner
surface being formed with threads (28), whereby the cap

body may be mounted to the threaded neck portion of a
bottle, the lid member being mounted on the cap body member

by a hinge (32) so that said lid member may be pivoted from
a closed position to an open position; and locking means

(30,80) positioned between the lid member and the cap body
member, whereby the lid member is held by the locking means

in a sealed and locked position; characterised by:

   a gasket (70) mounted within the cap body member and
having an inwardly extending portion (74) which is able, in

use, to extend inwardly over an inner edge (13a) of the
neck of a bottle, the lid member having a convex, semi-spherical,

gasket-engaging surface (44), adapted to engage
the inwardly extending portion (74) of the gasket when the

lid is in the closed position thereby, in use, compressing
the gasket between the gasket-engaging surface of the lid

member and the neck of the bottle to thereby provide a
positive, substantially gas-tight seal. 
A bottle cap device as claimed in claim 1,
including means (50) for latching said lid member in an

open position.
A bottle cap device as recited in claim 1 or 2,
wherein said gasket (70) comprises a ring member (72)

having an outer annular flange member (73) to seal the cap
to a bottle, in use of the bottle cap device, and the inwardly extending

portion (74) of the gasket (70) is an inner annular sealing
lip member (74) the sealing lip being positioned within

said cap body for engagement with the semi-spherical gasket
engaging surface of the sealing means.
A bottle cap device as recited in any preceding
claim wherein, said locking means comprises:


a hook member (30) formed in said annular wall of said
cap body member and projecting outwardly therefrom; and
a locking tongue (80) integrally affixed to said lid
member so as to snap over said hook member when said lid

member is placed in a closed sealed position over said cap
body.
A bottle cap device as recited in any preceding
claim, wherein said hinge comprises:


a pair of spaced rear leg members (48) integrally 
formed with said lid member;
a pair of upper spaced arm members (34) integrally
formed with said cap body member being spaced apart from

each other;
a lower arm member (36) integrally formed with said
cap body member and mounted below and between said upper

hinge arm members; and
a pivot pin (38) mounted between said leg members and
positioned between said upper and lower arm members,

whereby said like member is rotatably mounted to said cap
body member.
A bottle cap device as recited in claims 2 and 5,
wherein said means for latching said lid member in an open

position comprises:

a longitudinal rib member (52) formed along said pivot
pin (38) of said lid member; and
a nipple member (54) formed on said lower arm and
positioned to engage said rib member as said lid member is

rotated to a fully open position.
