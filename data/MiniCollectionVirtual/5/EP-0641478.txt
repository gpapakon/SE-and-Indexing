<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to belt-driven data cartridges and, in particular, to 
processes for producing base plates used therein. The manufacture of tape data cartridges involves the processing and 
assembly of precision components which enables magnetic recording tape to be 
operated in the data cartridge in a manner achieving very high areal recording 
densities. Such product performance requirements are increasingly rigorous in 
the areas of speed and capacity. These performance characteristics are 
determined by various component-related features. A particularly important 
component is the data cartridge base plate. The base plate topography affects 
the perpendicularity of pins mounted in the base plate. These pins support 
other components of the data cartridge, which in turn affects the performance of 
a tape moving in the data cartridge. The designers and manufacturers of data cartridge base plates have 
focused on improved flatness and rigidity as primary features in controlling the 
quality of base plates. Other focus areas involve the methods of forming and 
blanking the metal used in the manufacture of the base plates. US-A-4,989,806 reflecting the subject matter of the preamble of the independent claims, discloses a data cartridge including an outer 
housing for holding various internal tape guiding and 
transporting components. The housing comprises a flat base 
plate which is generally of metal such as aluminum and a 
cover member of a transparent plastic material secured at a 
predetermined spacing from the base plate. US-A-4,571,789 relates to a snap fastener for a belt driven 
cartridge wherein the cartridge comprises a thin base plate 
usually of aluminum and in a clear polymeric cover which 
when assembled define a thin generally rectangular 
enclosure. US-A-4,674,703 relates to a temperature compensating closure 
for cartridges, and discloses a cassette including a plastic 
molded cover and a metal base plate. None of the prior art documents describe a pre-coating of 
the base plate to have free holes comprising better 
tolerances and providing better perpendicularity to the pins 
being inserted This invention relates to a new and different approach to controlling 
base plate quality. A method of manufacturing a base plate for use in a data cartridge uses 
coated aluminum which is provided in a piece form. The piece is leveled to 
form a flat plate and then blanked to form a data cartridge base plate. An improved data cartridge base plate is manufactured by coating metal 
to be used

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a data cartridge base plate, 
comprising the steps of: 


a) providing (50) a sheet of aluminum, 
b) leveling and dimensioning (56) said sheet to form 
a flat plate (14) having a designated width; 
c) blanking (60) the flat plate to form a data 
cartridge base plate having a pin insertion aperture surface 

defining a plurality of pin insertion apertures (28) extending 
perpendicularly through the width of the plate, each pin 

insertion aperture (28) having a substantially uniform size with 
an error tolerance of less than 0.0127 millimeter; and 
d) stippling the thus formed base plate to provide 
enhanced flatness thereto, 
 
   characterized in that an anodized insulative coating (50) is 

applied on both major surfaces of the sheet of aluminum prior to 
the time the sheet is leveled, dimensioned, blanked and stippled, 

thereby ensuring that no treatment of the sheet need occur 
between the formation of said apertures (28) and the insertion of 

pins (18) therein, such that a precise match between the aperture 
dimensions and the outside dimension of the pins may be 

maintained. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the step (50) of providing 
coated aluminum comprises providing aluminum having a uniform 

coating thickness of between 0.0001 inch (0.00254 millimeter) and 
0.0002 inch (0.00508 millimeter). 
The method of claim 1, wherein the step (50) of providing 
coated aluminum comprises providing aluminum which is coated 

after processing the aluminum to a desired roll thickness and 
before the aluminum is cut to a base plate shaped article. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of 
shaving the base plate after the base plate has been blanked so 

that the pin aperture surface (28) provides enhanced  
 

perpendicularity to a pin (18) placed within the base plate pin 
aperture. 
A data cartridge base plate (14) prepared by a method 
comprising the steps of: 


a) providing (50) a sheet of aluminum, 
b) leveling and dimensioning (56) said sheet to form 
a flat plate having a designated width; 
c) blanking (60) the flat plate to form said data 
cartridge base plate (14) having a pin insertion aperture surface 

defining a plurality of pin insertion apertures (28) extending 
perpendicularly through the width of the plate, each pin 

insertion aperture (28) having a substantially uniform size with 
an error tolerance of less than 0.0127 millimeter; and 
d) stippling the thus formed base plate (14) to 
provide enhanced flatness thereto, 
 
   characterized in that an anodized insulative coating (50) 

was applied on both major surfaces of the sheet of aluminum prior 
to the time the sheet is leveled, dimensioned, blanked and 

stippled, thereby ensuring that no treatment of the sheet need 
occur between the formation of said apertures (28) and the 

insertion of pins (18) therein, such that a precise match between 
the aperture dimensions and the outside dimension of the pins may 

be maintained. 
A data storage tape cartridge comprising a flat 
metallic base plate (14) and component parts mounted on the 

plate, including pins (18) that are nominally perpendicular to 
said base plate and which support and facilitate tape transfer within 

the cartridge; the major surfaces of said base plate (14) being covered 
by a protective coating; said base plate containing holes in which said 

pins are mounted; the cartridge being characterized in that the protective coating is 
applied to the major surfaces of said base plate before the holes are 

formed so that the surfaces (28) of said base plate (14) defining said 
holes are free of the protective coating at the time the pins 

(18) are inserted into the holes, whereby the holes, and the pins  
 

inserted in the holes, have a precise perpendicularity to said base 
plate. 
A cartridge of claim 6 in which the exterior edge 
surface of the base plate (14) is also free of the protective coating. 
A cartridge of claim 6 in which the base plate (14) is stippled 
after the protective coating is applied. 
A cartridge of claim 6 in which the base plate (14) comprises 
aluminum and the protective coating comprises an anodized coating 

on the aluminum.
