sheet metal (2), and a second set of joining elements (11-14, 
16, 18, 21) obtained on a flat part (8) of a second casing of 

sheet metal (1); the first set of joining elements (10, 50, 15,

and that can be displaced in a direction parallel to said flat 
part of the first casing of sheet metal (2) to surround said 

tang (10) and to engage one edge of said at least one opening 
(50, 52), so as to oppose a displacement of the two casings of 

sheet metal (1, 2) in the orthogonal direction and to a further 
displacement of the same in the direction and in the sense of 

coupling of the two casings of sheet metal (1, 2). Preferably 
there are also further joining elements (14-18) suitable for

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a joint for the rigid 
coupling of casings of sheet metal. The rigid coupling or joining between two casings of sheet 
metal can be made with several techniques, such as welding, 
riveting, buttoning, screwing up and hooking up. Welding is the most widely used joining technique, and it 
guarantees the highest resistance to the separation of the two 
welded casings. The points to be joined, however, have to be 
accessible to the welding electrodes, and the casings to be 
welded should not be protected by zinc, paint or plastic. A 
further drawback resides in the fact that the two welded 
casings cannot be separated except by breakage. Riveting and buttoning also exhibit drawbacks linked with 
the fact that the points to be joined have to be accessible to 
the riveting or to the buttoning machine, and the joined 
casings cannot be separated except by recourse to breakage. Screwing up by means of screw and nut is laborious, and as 
with the preceding techniques it requires that the points to be 
joined be accessible, while hooking up can give rise to 
involuntary and undesired uncouplings. In view of the described state of the art, the object of 
the present invention is to provide a joint for the rigid 
coupling of two casings of sheet metal possibly coated with a 
protective material, such that the joining of the two casings 
can be made anywhere and by any person without the use of any 
tool, and thus without the points to be joined having to be 
accessible. Such a joint should also not require the use of  
 
any material other than that constituting the casings to be 
coupled, and it should be possible to manufacture it with a 
single manufacturing process, made by the same machine used for 
the manufacture of the casings to be joined. It should also be 
kept in mind that for such a joint to be used in the coupling 
of box-like panels for furniture, whose manufacture includes 
pressing steps, the joint should not have protruding parts 
located on the faces of the individual panels. According to the present invention, such object is attained 
thanks to a joint for the coupling of a first casing of sheet 
metal to a second casing of sheet metal, characterized in that 
it comprises a first set of joining elements obtained on a flat 
part of the first casing of sheet metal, which flat part 
constitutes a joining plane of the two casings of sheet metal, 
and a second set of joining elements obtained on a flat part of 
the second casing of sheet metal, said first set of
