<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a pretensioner for vehicle seat-belt systems, a drive is provided which has a pyrotechnic gas generator (12) and a piston/cylinder unit (16, 20), the piston (20) of which is arranged at a first end (161) of the cylinder (16) and is connected to a pull cable (22), and through the gas pressure produced by the gas generator (12) is accelerated to the second end (162) of the cylinder (16), which end has a constriction. A sleeve-shaped insert part (18) is arranged in the cylinder (16) as a piston catch safeguard. The constriction forms a stop for the sleeve-shaped insert part (18). The internal surface area and/or the external surface area of the insert part (18) is of profiled design in order to provide space for plastic deformation of the material.

A belt pretensioner for vehicle safety belt systems, 
comprising a pyrotechnic gas generator (12) and a piston and 

cylinder unit (16, 20), whose piston (20) is arranged at a 
first end (161) of the cylinder (16), and furthermore is 

connected with a cable (22) and by means of the gas pressure 
produced by the gas generator (12) is accelerated towards 

the second end (162) of the cylinder (16), which has a 
constriction, characterized in that a sleeve-like insert 

(18) is arranged in the cylinder (16) and the constriction 
constitutes an abutment for the sleeve-like insert (18), the 

inner enveloping surface and/or the outer enveloping surface 
of the insert (18) having a profiled cross section. 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that t
he fusion temperature of the material of the 
insert (18) is above the self-ignition temperature of the 

pyrotechnic gas generator (12). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the insert (18) consists of a metallic solder-like 

material. 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 2 and in claim 
3, characterized in that the insert (18) consists of a tin 

alloy.  
 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the piston (20) is 

designed in the form of a penetration body, whose cross 
section increases from the end of the piston (20) facing the 

insert (18) towards the other end thereof. 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in claim 5, characterized 
in that the piston (20) is at least in part designed to 

be conical or frustoconical. 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said profiled 

section comprises ridges (41, 42, 44, 46, 51) and/or grooves 
(40, 50) on the inner enveloping surface and/or the outer 

enveloping surface of the insert (18). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that an enveloping 

surface of the insert (18) essentially corresponds to the 
inner surface of the cylinder (16) at the second end (162). 
The belt pretensioner as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the constriction 

of the cylinder (16) is frustoconical.
