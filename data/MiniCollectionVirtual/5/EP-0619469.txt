<ABSTRACT>
A non-contact, laser detection system for detecting the 
extended state of an object in continuous motion such as a 

drill bit. For detecting the state of sufficient or 
insufficient flute length of the drill bit, the drill bit is 

moved in relation to the laser detection system until energy 
reflected from the tip of the drill bit is detected. Then, 

the drill bit is moved in relation to the laser detection 
system a pre-selected distance from the point at which the tip 

was initially detected, to a second point where the energy 
reflected from the drill bit is analyzed by a computer to 

determine if the laser is still incident on the fluted section 
of the drill bit. If the computer determines that the laser 

is still incident on the fluted section, then the flute length 
of the drill bit is at least as long as the pre-selected 

distance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to industrial type non-contact 
detection systems for ascertaining the state of an 
object in a machine system. More specifically, the present 
invention relates to a laser detection system for ascertaining 
the state of rotating objects or objects in some other 
continuous repetitive motion. The development of machinery for automated manufacturing 
has produced many benefits to mankind. More specifically, 
today, the manufacture of most consumer and industrial 
electronic instruments and appliances is largely automated. 
During the manufacture of electronics boards, holes must be 
precisely drilled in a circuit board for interconnecting 
circuits on the board and for fastening the boards to a 
chassis. For this purpose, high speed, computerized drilling 
machines rapidly position the board, hold it in place, and 
drill the necessary holes. However, problems arise when a drill bit breaks during 
the drilling operation and the broken bit goes undetected. If 
the broken bit is not detected, the drilling machine will 
attempt to continue drilling holes with serious consequences. 
On the one hand, if the drill breakage occurs only a small 
distance from the tip of the bit, the drilling machine will 
continue to drill with the damaged drill bit, thus destroying 
the board or, at best, producing unacceptably poor quality 
holes and, in either case, this may require the defective 
circuit board to be discarded. On the other hand, if the 
drill breakage occurs at a greater distance from the drill 
tip, the resultant circuit board will lack holes which were to 
be created in the drilling process subsequent to the bit being  
 
damaged. A defective board lacking one or more holes may be 
recognized during a post-inspection process and the missing 
holes may be drilled. However, this corrective procedure 
causes a significant reduction in productivity. While non-contact systems for detecting broken bits are 
presently available, conventional non-contact systems are 
typically highly affected by environmental conditions and are 
unable to be conveniently located on the drilling system. 
Presently known non-contact detection systems include those 
using light emitting diode (LED) or microwave technologies, 
both of which are highly susceptible to environmental 
conditions. These non-contact detection systems do not 
utilize the benefits of the continuous repetitive movement of 
the object to eliminate error, interference and the effects of 
harsh changing environmental conditions. Also,
