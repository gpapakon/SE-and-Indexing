<ABSTRACT>
This invention is to obtain a high precision printing apparatus with 
smaller number of parts, which can detect the existence of the recording 

paper. For this purpose, this invention provides a high precision and less-expensive 
printing apparatus which fewer parts than in prior art, in no 

relation to the passing route of recording paper by way of assembly of the 
sensor which detects the existence of the recording paper directly onto the 

thermal head holder or the line thermal head board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printing apparatus which has a detecting 
device which detects the existence of a printing paper. It is known as prior art such a small type printer, as shown in Fig. 5 and 
Fig. 6, that a multiple number of inner passing routes through which the 
recording paper passes is set in order to print recording data on the recording 
paper by means for instance, of thermal printer. In the inner passing 
route of the recording paper, the detecting device which detects the existence 
of the recording paper is set. And when the route is changed, the 
detecting device is also changed in prior art in accordance with the change 
in the route. For example, as shown in Fig. 5, a photo-sensor 8 is soldered on the board 
9 which is fixed on the sensor holder 10 and such sensor holder 10 is fixed 
on the frame 1. On the board 9, a multiple number of circuit pattern 11 is 
fixed, for example, with solder, and a connector 12 is fixed at the top of 
said circuit pattern 11. When the existence of a recording paper should be 
detected after the change in its passing route in accordance with the change 
in the passing route of the recording paper, there exist problems that such 
a sensor needs to be refixed in the other position than in the prior position 
which is shown in Fig. 5, as shown in Fig. 6, or that the assembly of such a 
sensor has to be performed in the other process, and etc. As explained above, in the printing apparatus in prior art, there exist 
problems not only that such parts as a board for the fixing of sensor and 
its holder, etc. are required in order to change in the passing route of the 
printing paper, but also additional assembling process of, soldering of  
 
circuit pattern on the board, fixing of the connector, etc. is required. 
Therefore, those invites the increase in cost. And since the sensor is fixed at the other position than that of the heat 
resistor set on line thermal head, the data that is to be printed in between 
the both above disappears, and therefore a datum memory for such data 
above is required, of which capacity corresponds to the data size which is 
to be disappeared as above, in order to avoid such situation as above. The object of this invention is to solve such problems in prior art above 
and to obtain high precision and less-expensive printing apparatus with 
fewer parts. The object of the invention is to obtain a high precision printing 
apparatus with smaller number of parts, which can detect the existence of 
the recording paper. In order to
