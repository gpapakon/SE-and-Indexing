<ABSTRACT>
A shelving support system is disclosed comprising a series of spaced vertical columnar supports (300) of steel channel having a series of cutouts (320) formed at regularly-spaced intervals in the flanges (308) thereof. Each cutout (320) defines an upper lip (323), a lower lip (235) and a rear horizontal shoulder (342). Linear extrusions (324a and 324b) of suitable aluminium or plastics material which define shelf-slots (326) are fitted into cutouts (320) so as to be horizontally located between the backs of upper and lower lips (323 and 325) and the rear periphery (344), and, so as to be located vertically by the underside of a shoulder (342) formed on flange (308) at the rear of the cutout and a land (362) and/or the top of the lower lip (325) at or near the lower front of the cutout. Each extrusion (324) includes a curved, forwardly-facing, hook-like thumb-strip formed along its upper wall which hooks behind upper lip (323) when the extrusion is in place within the cutout (320). The extrusion (324) being fitted in place by tilting it down and to the rear until thumb-strip (326) passes under lip (323) and then swinging the front of extrusion (324) down to bring its back wall (334) into contact with rear face (344) of cutout (320). An upwardly facing panel-slot (346) and a downwardly facing panel-slot (348) are respectively formed on the upper front face and the lower front face of extrusion (320), the depth of upper slot (346) being greater than that of lower slot (348). An appropriately cut finishing-panel (364) can be inserted in place between adjacent extrusions (324a and 324b) by first entering its upper edge into lower slot (348) of upper extrusion (324a) until the top of slot (346) is reached, aligning its lower edge with the upper slot (346) of lower extrusion (324b) and then allowing the panel to drop into that slot.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SHELVING SUPPORT SYSTEM TECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to support systems for shelves, brackets and the like suitable for the lateral display and storage of goods in shops, libraries and storage areas. More particularly, the invention relates to support systems of the type having vertical columnar supports fixed at regular intervals to a wall(or other fixture) and having means for attaching a series of horizontally arranged shelves, brackets and/or hangers to the supports.Though not confined thereto, the support systems of this invention are particularly suited for shelf-based display of goods in shops.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTIONIdeally, display shelving for shops should be readily and cheaply adjustable and yet provide an attractive finish. This combination is difficult to achieve. It is well known, for example, to use slotted columnar supports with snap-in shelf- support brackets to provide cheap and rapid adjustment of shelf height or position. A variety of hooks and hangers can be used with such slotted supports. But the supports and brackets are unsightly. Panelling can be used between the shelves to cover the supports and the wall, but this immediately removes the advantage of adjustability and leaves the unsightly shelf- support brackets uncovered.It is also known to use attractively finished wall-panels having a series of fixed, vertically-spaced, horizontal-extending T- slots into which shelf-support and other brackets may be fitted. A system of this type, marketed as SHOWALL®, is produced by Display Systems Inc of Chilhowie, Virginia, USA. However, as the slotted panels are costly, the unused slots are unsightly, and vertical adjustability is limited because the number of slots in a panel must be limited to keep panel costs within reason. Moreover, unsightly braced brackets are still required to support shelving. 

OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTIONIt is the broad objective of the invention to provide an improved shelving system of the general type indicated above. Preferably, the shelving system should do away with the need for shelf support brackets, provide adequate flexibility in the adjustment of shelf height, and, provide means for attractively panelling the spaces between the shelves while still allowing subsequent shelf adjustment without difficulty or great cost. However, it is not necessary for all these desiderata to be satisfied by every embodiment of the invention.OUTLINE OF INVENTIONIn the shelving support system of this invention: each columnar support includes at least one

THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1 A shelving support system of the type having a plurality of spaced, normally vertical columnar supports and a plurality of normally-horizontal shelf support means for attachment to the columnar supports, the support system being characterised in that:
• each columnar support has a back adapted for attachment to a fixture and at least one longitudinally-extending flange attached to the back, extending forward therefrom and terminating in a front edge,
• cutouts are formed in each flange at regular intervals along its length, each cutout opening into said front edge, extending rearwards therefrom and being shaped so that the upper and forward part of its periphery defines a downward¬ ly-extending upper-lip of flange material, the shelf support means comprise linear extrusions of metal or plastics material adapted to fit within said cutouts when arranged substantially horizontally, each extrusion having integral upper, rear and lower walls defining (in section) a forwardly-extending and forwardly-opening shelf-slot which extends along the extrusion and is thereby adapted to receive the rear edge of a shelf to be supported thereby, and • an upwardly extending thumb-strip formed integrally with said upper wall of the extrusion near the forward open end of said shelf-slot and adapted for location behind said upper lip when the extrusion is place within said cutout, whereby, the extrusion may be held orthogonal to the web and inserted rearwardly into one of the cutouts by first tilting the extrusion up and back to allow said thumb-strip to pass behind said upper-lip and then tilting the extrusion down and forwards until the forward face of said thumb-strip contacts the upper- lip and the lower and/or rear walls of the extrusion make contact with the periphery of the cutout.
2 A support system according to claim 1 wherein, at least the rear portion of said upper wall of the shelf- slot of each extrusion is substantially horizontal (when 


 viewed in section and said extrusion is fitted within a cutout) , and
• the rear of the cutout is shaped to define a downwardly- facing substantially horizontal shoulder adapted to abut and support said rear portion of the upper wall, so that, when the extrusion is fitted within a cutout and a shelf is fitted within said shelf-slot, the weight of the shelf is principally supported by the columnar support via said shoulder and the lower and forward edge of the cutout.
3 A support system according to claim 1 or 2 wherein:
• the lower and forward part of the periphery of said cutout defines an upwardly-extending lower-lip of flange material, and • a forwardly-facing abutment is formed on or by said lower wall of the extrusion and is adapted to abut against the rear edge of said upwardly-facing lip when the extrusion is fitted within the cutout, whereby, after insertion in the cutout, the extrusion cannot be removed without first raising said abutment clear of said lower- lip.
4 A support system according to claim 3 wherein:
• the cutout extends substantially below the level of the rear portion of the lower wall of the shelf-slot (when the extrusion is fitted with said cutout) , so that the extrusion can be entered and removed from the cutout by tilting its rear downward so that said abutment clears said lower lip.
5 A support system according to claim 2, 3 or 4 wherein,
• the forward portion of the lower wall of the shelf-slot is raised at or near its forward end relative to the rear portion thereof so as to define, on the upper face of the lower wall, a land for the support of a shelf fitted within the shelf-slot and so as to define, on the under-face of the lower wall, a recess or slot adapted to accommodate said lower lip when the extrusion is fitted within said cutout; and 


• the forward portion of the upper wall of the shelf-slot is raised relative to the rear portion thereof so that (i) the height of the front opening of the shelf-slot (measured between said land and said forward portion of the upper wall) is substantially greater than the thickness of a shelf to be accommodated within said shelf-slot, (ii) the vertical distance between the level of the rear portion of the upper wall and level of said land approximates said thickness, and
(iii) the distance between the rear portion of the upper wall and the rear portion of the lower wall is substantially greater than said thickness; whereby a shelf of said thickness may be readily inserted within the shelf-slot by tilting the shelf up and back to pass the rear edge of the shelf rearwardly beyond the land and beneath the rear portion of the upper wall, the shelf being returned to the horizontal after insertion into the shelf-slot so that it is supported by the contact of its upper rear edge with the rear portion of the upper wall and by contact of its lower face with the land formed on the upper face of the lower wall.
6 A support system according to any preceding claim wherein, an upper upwardly-facing panel-slot is formed along the forward edge of the upper wall of the shelf-slot,
• a lower downwardly-facing panel-slot is formed along the forward edge of the lower wall of the shelf-slot, the depth of said lower panel-slot being greater than that of said upper panel-slot, said panel-slots being adapted to respectively accommodate the lower and upper edges of panels fitted respectively between said extrusion and adjacent upper and lower extrusions arranged in respectively upper and lower cutouts in said columnar support.
7 A support system according to any preceding claim wherein,
• said thumb-strip is of curved shape in section so as to form a forwardly facing hook adapted to be engaged with and rotate about the upper-lip as the extrusion is first entered into the cutout.
