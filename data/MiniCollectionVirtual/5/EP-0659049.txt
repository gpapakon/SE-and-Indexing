<ABSTRACT>
A method of improving properties of a dough and/or a baked product made from dough by adding an enzyme preparation to the dough and/or to any ingredient of the dough and/or to any mixture of the dough ingredients, in which method: a) the enzyme preparation comprises a lipase of microbial origin and is added in an amount corresponding to at the most 2100 LU/kg of flour, or b) the dough is substantially free from added fat or contains only low amounts of added fat and the enzyme preparation comprises a lipase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing
a dough and/or of a baked product made from dough by
use of enzymes. Furthermore, the invention relates
to a dough and a pre-mix for a dough comprising these enzymes. Finally, the invention relates to the use of an enzyme preparation in a method
for the preparation of dough and/or a baked product prepared from the dough.In the bread-making process it is known to add bread-improving
additives and/or dough conditioners to the bread dough, the
action of which, inter alia, results in improved texture,
volume, flavour and freshness of the bread as well as improved
machinability of the dough.In recent years enzymes have been found to be useful as dough
conditioners and/or bread-improving agents, in particular
enzymes such as amylases and proteases which act on components
present in large amounts in the dough.Lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) is an enzyme belonging to the glycerol
ester hydrolases, which catalyzes hydrolysis of ester bonds in
triglycerides. The use of lipases in the preparation of bread
has been suggested for smoothening and thereby improving the
texture of bread, but it has been concluded that when lipase is
used alone other properties of the bread such as bread volume,
elasticity of the crumb and mouth-feel are deteriorated (JP-A
62-285749). In fact, the use of lipase in the baking industry
has been stated as undesirable (Gams, 1976).JP-A 62-285749 discloses a method of making bread, in which
lipase is added to dough in admixture with vital gluten and
lecithin. By the addition of vital gluten and lecithin the 
undesirable effects of lipase are stated to be avoided or
diminished.EP 468 731 discloses the use of a bread-improver comprising the
enzyme glucose oxidase, optionally in combination with other
enzymes such as hydrolases. Lipase is mentioned as one example
of such hydrolase.In both of the above references baking trials are described, in
which lipase is added alone without addition of any of the
other improving agents described in these references. These
baking trials serve the purpose of illustrating the
dissatisfactory results obtained by use of lipase alone as
compared to the results obtained when lipase is used in
admixture with the other improving agents described in these
references. In EP 468 731 the lipase used for these trials have
not been specified, whereas the lipase used in JP-A 62-285749
is stated to be Talipase, apparently a lipase produced by a
species of the genus Rhizopus. In the baking trials disclosed
in JP-A 62-285749, the
