<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an amplifying gate thyristor comprising a main thyristor and an amplifying thyristor. The amplifying thyristor (GTO) is of the gate turn-on type. The main thyristor (T1) and the amplifying thyristor (GTO) are produced in such a way that the amplifying thyristor is conducting while the main thyristor is normally conducting. One application of the present invention resides in the switches associated with ballasts of fluorescent lamps fed by rectified alternating current.

An amplifying-gate thyristor including a main
thyristor and an amplifying thyristor, characterized in that:


the amplifying thyristor is of the gate turnoff-type;
the main thyristor (T1) is of a conventional type
that cannot be turned off by its gate; and
the main thyristor (T1) and the amplifying thyristor
are such that the amplifying thyristor remains in the

conductive state while the main thyristor is normally
conductive, the current in the amplifying thyristor having a

predetermined value (I2
0
) when the current in the main
thyristor (T1) is close to its hold current (I
H
), and
in that it includes means for detecting the moment
when the whole current in the thyristor drops to a value

substantially equal to the sum of said hold current and of
said current having a predetermined value, and means for

applying a negative gate voltage to the gate turnoff
thyristor once this detection has been carried out.
The thyristor of claim 1, manufactured as a monolithic
component in which the main thyristor and the

amplifying thyristor are vertically disposed in a semi-conductor
structure.
The thyristor of claim 2, characterized in that
the main thyristor and the amplifying thyristor have distinct

emitter and/or cathode doping levels.
Application of the thyristor of claim 1 to a
fluorescent lamp switching circuit, wherein said thyristor is

connected to the d.c. terminals of a rectifying bridge (19),
in series with a series of diodes (d1, d2), with a resistor

(21) disposed between gate and anode, and a switch (23) 
controlled between the gate of the thyristor and the cathode

of the last diode of the series of diodes, the value of the
sum of the hold current (I
H
) of the main thyristor and of the
current (I2
0
) in the amplifying thyristor being greater than
the current in the thyristor during the preheating phase of

the fluorescent lamp.
