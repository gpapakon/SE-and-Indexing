<ABSTRACT>
A rope comprising a pluraliry of wires 2, 3, 4 
made of a steel wire being twisted together; at least 

the wires (for instance, the wires 4 in the second 
layer) which are arranged in such a manner as to be 

disposed on an outer surface of the rope 1 being made of 
a plated steel wire (e.g. zinc-aluminum alloy plated 

steel wire) wherein a corrosion resistance is 
superior; at least said wires (for instance, the core 

wire 2 and the wires in the first layer) which are 
located in a center of the rope not being made of the 

wire wherein the corrosion resistance is 
superior, thereby the cost for producing the rope is 

remarkably reduced without damaging the 
corrosion resistance and the endurance 

property.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rope for
operating (hereinafter referred to as a rope), more
particularly to such a rope wherein the corrosion
resistance is improved without lowering the durability for
bending and a rope wherein the corrosion resistance is
remarkably improved, each of which is preferably used
for many technical fields such as a window regulator for
an automobile.A rope is generally produced by stranding a
plurality of wires or by stranding a plularity of
ropes (in this case the rope is called a strand). Such
rope is sometimes corroded by, for example, water
containing salt.In order to prevent the rope from being
corroded, the ropes mentioned hereinafter are proposed.
(a) Steel wire plated with zinc is drawn to obtain a
wire for a rope. A plurality of the wires are stranded
each other and plated with tin to obtain a wire rope
JP-U2-25500/1979).(b) Steel wire plated with nickel or nickel alloy
is plated with zinc or zinc alloy and is plated
with tin or tin alloy on the zinc or the zinc alloy
layer. Thus obtained steel wire is drawn and plurality
of the steel wires are twisted each other to obtain a
rope (JP-U2-10332/1990).(c) Steel wire plated with zinc-aluminum alloy is
drawn and stranded each other to obtain an inner core
for a control cable JP-A-212616/1990).The above-mentioned ropes and the inner cable
for a control cable have an anticorosion property which
has been indeed improved as compared with a normal rope
plated with zinc. However, with respect to the 
wire rope described in (a), the wire must be plated
before a step for drawing a wire rod and after the step
for stranding the wire, and a step for stranding the
wire should be required. For that reason, the number of
producing steps becomes rather many so that the cost for
producing the wire rope is high.With respect to the rope described in (b),
three kinds of plating steps are required for producing
the rope. Accordingly, producing steps increase
remarkably.With respect to the inner cable for the control
cable described in (c), each of the wires is plated
with zinc-aluminum alloy. Accordingly, cost for
producing the inner cable is high.On the other hand, for the purpose of improving
the durability on bending fatigue of the rope, generally
the diameter of the wire is made to be small in order to
decrease the bending stress. Therefore, the tension
strength is lowered due to the reduced diameter of each
wire. In order to decrease the tension stress, the number
of wires is increased.As rope wherein means for improving the
durabil
