<ABSTRACT>
The device includes, between an input terminal and an output terminal, a first and a second branch, in parallel with each other, each equipped with an amplifier (A1, A2), with a high-pass filter (C1, L1) in the first branch, and a low-pass filter (L2, C2) in the second branch, so as to select a different frequency range for each of the two amplifiers. According to the invention, the high-pass filter (C1, L1) and the low-pass filter (L2, C2) have practically the same cut off frequency and a moderate order, and the amplifiers (A1, A2) are of the same model. Applications: television: cabled networks.
