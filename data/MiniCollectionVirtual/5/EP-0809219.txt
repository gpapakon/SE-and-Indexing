<ABSTRACT>
A knowledge-based document analysis system and
process for identifying and decomposing constrained and

unconstrained images of scanned documents (100) is
disclosed. Low level features are extracted by a document

feature extractor (105) within bitonal and grayscale images.
Low level features are passed to a document classification

means (115) which forms initial hypotheses about the
document class. For constrained documents, a document

analysis means (125) sorts through various models to
determine the exact type of document and then extracts the

relevant fields for character recognition. For
unconstrained documents, through the use of a blackboard

architecture which includes a knowledge database and
knowledge sources, the document analysis means (125) creates

information and hypotheses to identify and locate relevant
fields within the document. These fields are then sent for

optical character recognition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to document analysis 
systems and processes. It is concerned with systems and 
processes that identify a document and fields or 
informational elements within such document. The ability to automate the process of data 
extraction from digital images of paper greatly increases 
the productivity and capacity of any business. By 
automating the data entry process, operating costs can be 
reduced due to reduced manpower requirements and capacity 
can be increased by maximizing the throughput of data entry 
operations. In businesses such as banking, there is a need 
for high speed processing of all types of documents. Banks 
usually receive many types of documents that must be entered 
into computers. In addition new services can be offered by 
automating data extraction from documents. As an example, 
extending Automatic Teller Machines (ATM) capabilities to 
include document processing would allow customers to cash 
cheques and receive funds back from the ATM. In the retail 
business there is a need to capture information from a 
customer at the point of sale. The information to be 
extracted could be from the customer's cheque or from his 
identification card (i.e. driver's license). Other 
applications for this invention is in wholesale and retail 
lockboxes. The more automated the process for handling 
payments, the lower the operating costs and the sooner the 
payments are credited. To provide a robust solution, the system must be 
capable of processing a mixed stream of document types. 
Also, the system must be capable of processing fixed format 
documents as well as highly unconstrained documents. To use a document analysis system the document is 
first scanned using one of several existing techniques such  
 
as a charged coupled device (CCD) to create a digital image 
representing a matrix of the black and white points on the 
page by a matrix of 0's and 1's. This matrix is then 
transmitted to a digital computer where it can be processed, 
displayed, identified and stored. The requirements for processing the scanned 
document can be divided into two types: identification and 
decomposition of constrained documents and identification 
and decomposition of unconstrained documents. The identification of constrained documents has 
been solved for various document types. For example the DP-ATM 
Model 5665 system produced by NCR in Dundee, Scotland, 
the HITC form identification system, available from NCR in 
Atlanta and the FIRST system developed by Quest, a division 
of

A system for analyzing a target document 
including at least one informational element, the system 

comprising: 

(a) means (100) for storing a digitized image of 
the target document; 
(b) document feature extractor means (105) for 
extracting low level features from the digitized image; 
(c) document classification means (115) for 
classifying the document based upon the extracted low level 

features; and 
(d) document analysis means (125) for analyzing 
the target document in order to extract informational data 

associated with the at least one informational element, 
responsive to the document classifying means (115). 
The system of claim 1, wherein the document 
feature extractor means (105)performs the steps of: 


(i) generating the coordinates of a region 
that encloses each of the at least one informational 

elements; 
(ii) generating an indicator corresponding 
to the type of informational element located within the 

region; and 
(iii) transmiting the coordinates and the 
indicator to the classifying means (115).

indicator is generated to correspond to an informational 

type selected from the group of: machine print, hand print, 
vertical lines, horizontal lines or noisy regions. 
The system of any one of the preceding claims 
1, wherein the classification means (115) performs the steps 

of:

set from at least one sample document, each sample 

immediate feature set corresponding to one of the at 
least one sample documents, and each feature set 

including at least one feature of its corresponding 
sample document; 
(ii) generating a sample indirect feature 
set for each of at least one sample document; 
(iii) generating a target document immediate 
feature set and a target document indirect feature set; 
(iv) comparing the target document immediate 
feature set and the target document indirect feature 

set with each of the sample immediate feature sets and 
the sample indirect feature sets; and

one sample document is selected from the group of: business 

cheque, deposit slip, giro or personal cheque.
