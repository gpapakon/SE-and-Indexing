Process for the drying of aqueous suspensions
containing sticky materials and solvents in the

presence of auxiliary materials with large specific
surface, characterised in that to the suspension,

which contains coagulates of the sticky materials
formed in known manner, there are added 5 - 30 wt.%

of a polyurethane foam powder with a bulk density of
50 - 500 kg/m
3
, it is intensively mixed and this
mixture is dried at temperatures of 50 - 200°C and a

pressure between 100 and 1000 mBar by distilling off
of the solvent phase.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in
that the drying is carried out at temperatures of

100 - 150°C and a pressure of 100 - 200 mBar.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the process is carried out continuously or is

carried out batchwise, whereby the drying time amounts
to one to three hours.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that, after the drying phase, a post-hardening

of the binding agents contained is carried
out at a temperature of 150 - 200°C.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the polyurethane contains 5 - 20

wt.% of mineral oil.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that active charcoal and/or chalk

and/or tens ides are additionally admixed with the
mixture.
