<ABSTRACT>
Annular element (3) placed between the two beads (12) of a tyre P mounted on a flat-bottomed wheel rim (J). In order to be able to use the said tyre P on the said wheel rim J without adding an air chamber (inner tube), the annular element (3), in order to seal the assembly has, in meridian section, a contour, and in particular two lateral sides (30) such that the clamping s between the ring (3) and the beads (12), from nothing or even a negative value to the base of the ring (3) then increases slightly over a certain radial distance h1 then increases greatly over a distance h2 which is radially adjacent to the first distance.

<CLAIMS>
A sealing ring (3) for mounting on a rim base (20) 
between the beads (12) of a tyre P having an inner form 

ratio H/S at most equal to 0.8, characterised in that 
in the unmounted state its meridian section is defined 

by a radially inner generatrix (31) of radius R
A
 equal 
to the radius R
J
 of the rim base (20) of the mounting 
rim J and of axial width L
A0
 of between 0.8 and 1 times 
the axial distance L
B0
 between the axially inner ends of 
the toes (15) of the beads (12) by a radially outer 

generatrix (32) of radius greater than the radius R
A
 by 
an amount h
C
 of between 0.05 R
J
 and 0.40 R
J
, and by two 
lateral sides (30) of identical profile (33, 34, 35), 

such that the transverse clamping L
A
 - L
B
 of the ring 
(3) on the inner walls of the beads (12), which is 

negative or zero at the level of the inner generatrix 
(31), successively increases slightly over a radial 

distance h
1
 at least equal to 0.05 R
J
, and then 
increases more greatly over a radial distance h
2
 at most 
equal to 0.4 R
J
, and becomes at most constant over the 
radial distance h
3
 at least equal to 0.02 R
J
, the sum of 
the distances h
1
, h
2
 and h
3
 being equal to the height h
B
 
of the lateral sides of the ring (1), the difference h
B
 
- h
C
 being at most equal to 0.05 R
J
 and the distances L
A
 
and L
B
 being the width of the ring (3) and the distance 
between the beads (12), respectively, measured across a 

generatrix G located at a variable radial distance h 
from the generatrix (31). 
A sealing ring (3) according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the increase in the clamping over 

the radial distance h
1
 is uniform, continuous and 
substantially linear until, at the level of the height 

h
1
, a maximum positive clamping at most equal to 0.30 L
A
 
is reached. 
A sealing ring (3) according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the increase of the clamping over  

 
the radial distance h
2
 is such as to reach a maximum 
positive clamping at least equal to 0.15 L
A
 at the level 
of the height h
1
 + h
2
. 
A sealing ring (3) according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the clamping over the radial 

distance h
3
 is positive and constant. 
A sealing ring (3) according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the radial distance h
1
 is 
between 0.05 R
J
 and 0.20 R
J
. 
A sealing ring (3) according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the radial distance h
2
 is between 
0 and 0.1 R
J
. 
A sealing ring (3) according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that the radial distance h
3
 is between 
0.02 R
J
 and 0.1 R
J
. 
A sealing ring (3) according to one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterised in that it is formed of a vulcanised 

rubber stock of Shore A hardness of at most 65 points. 
An assembly comprising a tyre P, a rim J and a 
ring (3), characterised in that the ring (3) is a 

sealing ring according to one of Claims 1 to 8.
