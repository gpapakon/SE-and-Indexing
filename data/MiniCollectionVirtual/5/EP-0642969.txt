Rack steering for motor vehicles, comprising: 

a ball joint with a ball pivot (9), which forms the end 
piece of a track rod, and a ball joint housing (2), in 

which a bearing shell serves as a bearing for the ball 
pivot, 
a rack steering housing (8), 
a rack (1) which is guided within this rack steering 
housing, is at least partly in the form of a hollow 

cylinder and is attached on one side to the ball joint 
housing (2), and 
bellows (4) which lie tight against the rack steering 
housing (8) on one side and on the ball pivot (9) on 

the other side, 
 
characterized in that
 
the rack (1) in the form of a hollow cylinder is 

connected to the ball joint housing (2) by an axial 
connecting gudgeon (3) with venting grooves (6), so that 

during movements of the rack (1), pressure compensation 
in the bellows (4) with respect to the atmospheric air 

pressure is effected via the venting grooves (6) in the 
connecting gudgeon (3) to the bore of the rack (1) in the 

form of a hollow cylinder. 
Rack steering for motor vehicles according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the connecting gudgeon (3) extends in the axial direction 

concentrically to the central axis (5), is connected to 
the ball joint housing (2) as one piece, and merges into 

a radial flange (7) on the side of the ball joint housing 
(2). 
Rack steering for motor vehicles according to claims 1 to 
2,
 
characterized in that
  
 

at least one venting groove (6) which merges into the 
radial flange (7) is incorporated in the connecting 

gudgeon (3). 
Rack steering for motor vehicles according to claims 1 to 
3,
 
characterized in that
 
several venting grooves (6) which merge into the radial 

flange (7) are incorporated in the connecting gudgeon 
(3). 
Rack steering for motor vehicles according to claims 1 to 
4,
 
characterized in that
 
the venting grooves (6) run axially in the axial region 

of the connecting gudgeon (3), in the surface thereof. 
Rack steering for motor vehicles according to claims 1 to 
5,
 
characterized in that
 
the venting grooves (6) run spirally in the axial region 

of the connecting gudgeon (3), in the surface thereof.
