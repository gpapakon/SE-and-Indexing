<ABSTRACT>
A laser beam emitted by a laser light source 1 is scanned in a series of small, 
high-speed oscillations in a first scanning direction by an acousto-optical deflector 

4, and scanned at a lower frequency in a second direction perpendicular to the first 
scanning direction by a vibration mirror galvanometer 8M, and scanned at yet 

a lower frequency in a third direction, parallel to the first direction, by a mirror 
galvanometer 11M, in order to enable high-precision scanning, and is projected 

onto a specimen 15. Light reflected or transmitted by the specimen 15 passes, via 
the mirror two galvanometers 11M and 8M and the AOD 4, through a confocal 

aperture 24 and is converted to an electrical signal by a photosensor 26. The 
signal is then converted to a standard television line format by a signal processor 

27.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser scanning optical microscope, and more 
particularly to a laser scanning optical microscope in which a laser beam from 
a laser light source is focussed to a small spot by an objective optical system 
and projected onto a specimen while also being scanned two-dimensionally, and 
light reflected or transmitted by the specimen is detected and photoelectrically 
converted by light receiving means to thereby obtain image information on the 
specimen. The optical scanning microscope is a combination of optical microscopy, with 
its long history, and electronics, which has made rapid progress in recent years, 
and its usefulness is widely recognized, especially with the development of the 
confocal point optical system. One of the advantages of the confocal optical 
system is that it can provide a marked improvement in image resolution and 
contrast by eliminating unwanted scattered light. The basic principle of the optical scanning microscope and confocal optical 
system was described over thirty years ago (see Reference (1): USP 3013467). 
In the systems of the time, an ordinary lamp was used as the light source and  
 
scanning was effected by using a voice coil mechanism to move the specimen 
stage, which made it difficult to quickly produce clear images. With the aim of providing real-time image capability, a confocal optical microscope 
that used a Nipkow disk perforated with a large number of holes was 
developed a considerable time ago (see for example Reference (2): Journal of the 
Optical Society of America Vol. 58 (1968) pp 661 to 664; USP 3517980; and USP 
4802748). This system, which was referred to as tandem scanning, could provide 
real-time naked-eye or photographic observation of images without using opto-electronic 
conversion, and received some practical application. However, a critical 
drawback of the tandem and other Nipkow disk system confocal microscopes has 
been that the light source was not bright enough, and a further problem was that 
with some observation objects the confocal effect was too small. These drawbacks 
have continued to limit the application of such systems. With the emergence of lasers, with their high spatial coherence, lasers have 
also come into use as light sources for confocal microscopes. In the first laser 
scanning microscopes (LSMs) the movement of the laser beam was effected by 
moving the objective lens in close proximity to the specimen (see Reference (3):
