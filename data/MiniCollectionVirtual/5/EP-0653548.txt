<ABSTRACT>
An opening is formed in a structural substrate 
such as of steel, iron or a plastics material, especially in 

an oil or gas well, by combining a liquid with abrasive 
particles which are soluble in the liquid, pressurizing the 

mixture and passing it to at least one jetting nozzle to 
expel it on to the substrate to form an opening therein. 

There are solid abrasive particles undissolved at the time 
of jetting. The residual abrasive particle laden solution 

can then be diluted with the original liquid, or a second 
liquid such as an acid can be added, to dissolve up all the 

particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method of 
cutting a structural substrate using liquid-borne 
abrasives. The structural substrates are high strength 
materials such as metals, steel, or iron, or polymeric 
materials such as polyvinyl chloride, or glass fiber 
reinforced thermosetting epoxy resin, for example. The 
method is particularly suitable for the downhole cutting of 
steel casing used in oil and gas wells. It is quite common to install a continuous tubular 
flow conductor, or casing, in a well bore in order to ensure 
long term integrity, serviceability of the well, and to 
increase the kinds and types of production enhancing 
treatments that may be performed within the well bore over 
the life of the well. Generally, casing is constructed of 
tubular members and joints made of steel, iron, polymeric 
materials such as polyvinyl chloride, or glass fiber 
reinforced thermosetting epoxy resin, with steel being the 
most common for use in oil and gas wells, and in some water 
wells. The steel casing is secured within the well bore by 
pumping cement downward through the casing, out of the 
bottom thereof, and then upwards between the exterior of the 
casing and the well bore. After the cement has been given 
time to cure, or set-up. the casing and adjacent cement are 
usually perforated at preselected locations so that pay 
zones at various depths can be accessed for producing oil,  
 
gas or water therefrom. Perforation of continuous casing is usually 
accomplished by setting off directional explosive charges or 
by hydraulic jetting. Perforating by explosive charges is 
carried out by lowering specially designed apparatus 
downhole to the desired depth at which the pay zone exists. 
Upon the explosive carrying apparatus being located, 
explosives are discharged which blast holes through the 
casing, allowing the adjacent formation to be in 
communication with the interior of the casing. Perforation by hydraulic jetting is accomplished 
by cutting holes, or slots, in the casing by lowering 
downhole tools referred to as hydraulic jetting tools, or 
water jetting tools, to the desired total depth and relative 
azimuth. Upon placing the hydrajetting tool at the desired 
depth and orientation, high pressure liquid, such as water 
at a delivered pressure of from a few thousand psi up to 
possibly as high as 15,000 psi (103 MPa) (150 - 1050 
kg/cm²) is pumped downhole to the tool which directs the 
pressurized fluid to a jet nozzle that expels the high 
pressure fluid at the wall of the casing

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming at least one opening in a 
structural substrate, which method comprises combining a 

liquid with abrasive particles which are soluble in the 
liquid, to form an abrasive particle laden solution having a 

predetermined concentration ratio; pressurizing the 
abrasive particle laden solution and passing it to at least 

one jetting nozzle, and subjecting the substrate in which an 
opening is to be formed to the expulsion of the abrasive 

particle laden solution at a distance and for a period of 
time necessary to form an opening therethrough. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the liquid 
and the soluble abrasive particles are combined to form a 

fully saturated solution laden with soluble abrasive 
particles. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the liquid 
and the soluble abrasive particles are combined to form less 

than a fully saturated solution laden with soluble abrasive 
particles, and wherein the substrate is exposed to expulsion 

thereof prior to the particles fully dissolving within the 
liquid. 
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein 
after forming the opening in the substrate, any residual 

abrasive particle laden solution is diluted with said 
liquid, or with a second liquid consisting of a preselected 

acid, to reduce the concentration of soluble abrasive 
particles therein to zero. 
A method according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, wherein 
the substrate is steel. 
A method according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the liquid is water. 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the soluble abrasive particles consist of calcium borate, 

borax, or a combination thereof. 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the soluble abrasive to liquid concentration is from 50 to 

125 grams per liter, the nozzle is placed at a distance of 
less than 4 cm, and the delivery pressure is within a range 

of 250 to 500 kg/cm² gauge. 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the structural substrate is a metallic or non-metallic 

casing in a wellbore, or of a polymeric material, such as 
polyvinyl chloride, or a fibre reinforced thermosetting 

epoxy resin. 
A method according to claim 9, wherein the casing 
is steel, and the formed opening extends through the casing 

as well as through any cement material adjacent the opening 
located between the casing and the well bore.
