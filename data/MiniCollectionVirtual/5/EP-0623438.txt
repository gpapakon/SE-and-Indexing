<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a feeding device for a two-roll or multi-roll calender (1-4), in particular for the processing of rubber, comprising transporting belts (12) and a cutting device (8) for the strip to be fed into the calender, which strip has preferably been produced by an extruder or a roll mill. The invention consists in that there is arranged downstream of the cutting device, arranged in the transporting path, a train of rollers (10), the final roller of which forms the end of the part of the transporting path running in the axial direction of the extruder or roll mill, that underneath the train of rollers there grips a transporting device, which comprises belts (12) arranged parallel to one another, is vertically pivotable, continues the transporting path at right angles and the belts of which upon pivoting pass through between the rollers of the train of rollers to an upper pivoted position and in this pivoted position are located above the train of rollers.

Feeding apparatus for a calender with two or more rolls,
 
consisting of a cutting device (8) for the strip which is to be fed 

into the calender and is preferably produced by an extruder or a 
rolling mill, a first part of the conveyor disposed after the 

cutting device (8) and on which the cut strips are conveyed parallel 
with the axis of the calender rolls (1, 2), and a second part of the 

conveyor on which the strips are conveyed perpendicular to the axis 
of the calender rolls (1, 2) into the roll gap and which is a 

continuation at right angles of the first part of the conveyor,
 
characterised in that the part of the conveyor running parallel with 

the axis of the calender rolls (1, 2) is a roller conveyor whose 
rollers (10) are mounted on the side remote from the calender at one 

end, in that the second part of the conveyor running perpendicular 
to the axial direction of the calender rolls (1, 2) is a belt 

conveyor which is pivotable vertically and disposed under the roller 
conveyor and whose belts (12) when pivoted pass through between the 

rollers (10) of the roller conveyor into an upper pivoting position 
and are located above the roller conveyor in this upper pivoted 

position, in that the end wheels (14, 15) are disposed together on 
two shafts, in that one (16) of the shafts is fixed in position and 

the second shaft is pivotable with its end wheels (15) about this 
shaft (16), and in that the diameter of the end wheels (15) of the 

belt conveyor (13) passing through between the rollers (10) of the 
roller conveyor is such that in their highest pivoting position the 

upper halves of the belts (12) pass through the interspaces between 
the rollers (10) of the roller conveyor and are located above the 

roller conveyor so that the shaft carrying the end wheels (15) 
remains under the rollers (10) and the shafts (22) of the rollers 

(10). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the length 
of the roller conveyor and the breadth
 of the belt conveyor (13) 
correspond to the useful breadth of the calender rolls (1, 2, 3, 4).  

 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the pivoting 
axis (16) of the belt conveyor (13) is located before the gap 

between the calender rolls (1, 2) or another gap into which the cut 
strips (21) are to be fed 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the belt 
conveyor (13) is pivotable with the aid of a lever mechanism which 

consists of at least one lever (17) acting on the frame of the belt 
conveyor (13) and a piston and cylinder unit (20) acting on the 

lever (17). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the belts 
(12) are V-belts or round belts. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the rollers 
(10) of the roller conveyor are driven by motor. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that at times the 
part (9, 10) of the conveyor running behind the cutting device (8) 

is driven at a higher conveying speed than the part (7) of the 
conveyor running in front of the cutting device (8).
