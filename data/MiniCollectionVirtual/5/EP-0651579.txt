<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system for processing compressed data corresponding to images, comprising decoding means (DEC) supplying an image memory (MEM) with the decoded image data, these means, in order to decode a current block of an image in the course of reconstruction, requiring a predictor block from a previously decoded image. According to the invention, several decoders (DEC) are associated with respective image memories (MEM) each storing a specific slice (SL) of corresponding blocks of several images, as well as at least one margin (1/2 SL) in which a predictor block is likely to be found serving to reconstruct a block of the specific slice.
