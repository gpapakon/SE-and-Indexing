<ABSTRACT>
Metal filter for a particulate trap meeting the 
requirements for low pressure drop, high collecting 

capacity and long life. The metal filters have one or more 
layers of unwoven fabric (such as felt) formed of a metal 

fiber having one of the following compositions A, B and C 
wherein 


A... Ni: 5-20% by weight, Cr: 10-40% by weight, Al: 1-15% 
by weight, the remainder being Fe and inevitable 

components; 
B... Cr: 10-40% by weight, Al: 1-15% by weight, the 
remainder being Ni and inevitable components; and 
C... Cr: 10-40% by weight, Al: 1-15% by weight, the 
remainder being Fe and inevitable components. 
The metal filter is highly resistant to corrosion and 
heat and can withstand to repeated heatings for removal of 

the particulate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filter for collecting 
particulates contained in exhaust, and more specifically a 
filter having increased corrosion resistance and high 
durability. Exhausts produced by automobiles are one of the major 
causes of atmospheric pollution and thus it is very 
important to develop a technique for removing harmful 
components from car exhausts. In case of diesel engine exhausts, it is of utmost 
importance to remove particulates contained in exhausts, 
which are mainly NOx and carbon. In order to remove such harmful contents, various 
efforts have been made to improve the engine structure. 
Such efforts include attaching an EGR and improving the 
fuel injection mechanism. But none of them has been a 
decisive solution. Another way to remove particulates is 
to provide a particulate trap in the exhaust passage 
(Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication 58-51235). This 
method, which is called the "post-treatment method", is 
considered the most practical and thus is now under 
extensive study. A particulate trap used to collect particulates 
contained in diesel engine exhausts has to satisfy the  
 
following three requirements: First, such a trap has to be capable of collecting 
particulates in exhausts to such an extent that the 
exhausts are purified to a satisfactory level. For this 
purpose, it is considered necessary to collect at least 60% 
of the particulates contained in diesel engine exhausts, 
though it depends on the displacement of the diesel engine 
and the load on the engine. Second, such a trap must not unduly increase the 
pressure drop of the exhaust. As the particulates 
collected by the trap increases, the pressure drop when the 
engine exhausts pass through the trap tends to increase. 
If the pressure drop exceeds a certain level, a back 
pressure may act on the engine, which gives a harmful 
influence on the engine. In order to protect the engine 
from the harmful influence of the back pressure, it is 
considered necessary to keep the pressure drop below 30 
KPa. For this purpose, the particulates collected by the 
trap have to be periodically removed to reduce the pressure 
drop to the original level. If the increase rate of the 
pressure drop relative to the amount of particulates 
collected is too high, the particulates have to be removed 
too frequently to be practical. Thus, it is necessary that  
 
such a particulate trap have a low initial pressure drop 
and that the pressure drop be less likely to increase with 
an increase in the amount of particulates
