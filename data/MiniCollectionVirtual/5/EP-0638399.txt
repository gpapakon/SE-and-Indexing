<ABSTRACT>
A combination mitre and bevel saw 10 is disclosed 
which includes an elongate fence guide 74 operatively 

connected to the saw blade assembly 20 and pivotable 
between a retracted position and an extended position 

in the plane of the saw blade 26. A spring 72 biasses 
the fence guide 74 into its retracted position. The 

fence guide 74 may be pulled down by the saw operator 
into its extended position so as to indicate the 

position at which the saw blade 36 will impinge upon 
the workpiece and so as to allow the setting of two 

fence members 17a, 17b accordingly. The fence guide 74 
includes a leading 78, which indicates the width of cut 

which the saw blade will make in the workpiece and a 
wider portion 80, trailing the leading edge 78, which 

indicates the optimum spacing of the fence members 17a, 
17b. As the saw blade 36 is pivoted about a bevel axis 

92 to enable bevel cuts to be made, the fence guide 74, 
supported on a guide support 62 also pivots about the 

bevel axis 92 by a corresponding amount. Thus, the 
fence guide 74 always lies in, and pivots in, the plane 

of the saw blade 36. 
It goes without saying, of course, that the fence 
guide 74 lies in the plane of the blade 36 and, at 

least in the position A, the blade, on pivotting about 
axis 28, must not impinge the guide 74. The same is 

also true of the housing 20 which, in the plane of the 
blade 36, has an opening permitting entry of the fence 

guide 74 within the housing 20 when the latter is 
pivotted downwardly about axis 28. 
The fence guide 74 permits an accurate estimate of 
the cut which will be made in a workpiece and also  

 
provides for accurate and optimum positioning of the 

fence members 17a, 17b.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power saws of the type 
comprising a table mounting a saw assembly having a 
motor driven blade adapted to cut workpieces positioned 
on the table. Such saws usually have a fence mounted 
on the table in the form of two aligned fence members 
which support and position the rear of the workpiece. A gap between the fence members allows passage of 
the blade during cutting of the workpiece and it is 
desirable for this gap to be closely aligned with the 
passage of the blade so that splintering of the rear of 
the workpiece, as the blade emerges therefrom, is 
minimised. Where the saw is not capable of making mitre or 
bevel cuts, the fence members can be fixed in the 
appropriate position. Where, however, mitre cuts 
and/or bevel cuts are to be made, the fence members are 
usually adjustable so that their optimum position can 
be obtained. This is normally achieved by first 
adjusting the saw to make the requisite mitre and/or 
bevel cut and then bringing the blade into its cutting 
position without the workpiece in place. The fence 
members are then adjusted with respect to the blade. 
However this is not always easy, firstly because the 
saw assembly usually needs to be held in its cutting 
position against the action of a restoring force 
tending it towards its rest position, and secondly, in 
this position, the bulk of the saw assembly gets in the 
way of convenient and easy adjustment of the fence 
members and usually restricts vision of the area around 
the blade. Another problem with such saws is that it is not 
always easy to gauge exactly where the blade will 
strike the workpiece during cutting, particularly when 
making mitre or bevel cuts, and so correct positioning 
of the workpiece on the table cannot be assured. 
Usually the workpiece is positioned approximately  
 
correct and then the blade moved towards the workpiece 
without starting the motor. The point where the blade 
will strike the workpiece can then be seen and final 
adjustment of the workpiece can be effected. Again, 
however, this is not always so easy and for the same 
reasons as mentioned above. On top of those is also 
the problem that with a circular saw blade it will 
always only touch the workpiece at a point (unless the 
workpiece has a concave surface corresponding to edge 
of blade) and moreover that edge is toothed and so the 
line of its cut is sometimes quite difficult to gauge. Thus it is an object of the present invention is to 
provide a saw in which the setting of the fence members 
and

<CLAIMS>
A power saw comprising a table, a saw assembly 
mounted on the table, the saw assembly having a motor 

and a blade driven by the motor, the blade lying in a 
plane and being movable in said plane to cut 

workpieces supported on the table, and an elongate 
fence guide which is pivotable with respect to the 

table in said plane about a first axis substantially 
perpendicular said plane. 
A saw according to claim 1, in which said saw 
assembly is pivotable with respect to the table about a 

second axis substantially parallel said first axis. 
A saw according to claim 2 including a pivot 
member pivotally mounted with respect to the table 

about a third axis substantially parallel to the 
surface of the table and substantially coincident with 

the plane of the saw blade, the saw assembly and the 
fence guide being pivotally mounted on the pivot member 

about the first and second axes respectively. 
A saw according to any preceding claim in which 
the fence guide includes a leading edge having a 

thickness substantially equal to the cutting thickness 
of the saw blade. 
A saw according to claim 4 in which the fence 
guide includes a region trailing its leading edge and 

having a thickness larger than the cutting thickness of 
the saw blade. 
A saw according to claim 4 or 5 in which the 
fence guide is biassed towards a retracted position. 
A saw according to any preceding claim including a 
fence fixed to the table. 
A saw according to claim 7 wherein the table 
includes a fixed part to which the fence is attached 

and a rotatable part with respect to which the saw 
blade and the fence guide are pivotally mounted.
