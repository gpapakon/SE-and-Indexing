<ABSTRACT>
The front of the roof opening (3) has the wedge (5) mounted 30 to 150 mm in front of the opening and extending over 20 to 50 percent of the width of the opening. The wedge is hinged at the front edge flush with the roof and is deployed w.r.t. the vehicle speed. It eliminates the low frequency wind noise associated with conventional openings. The wedge is operated by a servo motor linked to a speed related control. A simple servo drive uses an eccentric transmission to deploy the wedge. The wedge height is increased with speed, from a threshold speed and above a second threshold speed the height is reduced again. When the roof opening is closed, the wedge is flush with the roof.

A device for influencing the flow of air in the region of 
the roof opening (3) of an openable vehicle roof with a 

cover (4) which as desired opens and closes the roof opening 
(3) in the fixed roof skin (2), characterised in that the 

device is constituted by a strip (5) disposed centrally in 
front of and parallel with the front edge (3A) of the roof 

opening (3) and of which the length (L) amounts to 
approximately 20% to 50% of the width (B) of the roof 

opening (3) and of which the distance (A) amounts to 
approximately 30 mm to 150 mm from the roof opening (3). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
strip (5) has a rearwardly rising front surface (6). 
A device according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the top edge (7) of the strip (5) is 

variable in its height (H) in respect of the fixed roof skin 
(2). 
A device according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
strip (5) can be lowered into a receiving space (9) in the 

fixed roof skin (2). 
A device according to one of Claims 3 or 4, characterised in 
that the front edge of the strip (5) is pivotably mounted on 

the fixed roof skin (2). 
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 5, characterised in 
that to adjust the height of the strip (5) a drive 

(eccentric member 10, motor 11) is provided which engages 
its underside.  

 
A device according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
drive (motor 11) can be ac
tuated as a function of the 
travelling speed. 
A device according to Claim 7, characterised in that when a 
first travelling speed V
1
 is reached, the drive (motor 11) 
extends the strip (5) and lowers the strip (5) when a second 

higher travelling speed V
2
 is reached. 
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 8, characterised in 
that the adjustment of the height of the strip (5) takes 

place as a function of the position of the cover (4). 
A device according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the strip (5) serves as a carrier for 

a roof aerial (17). 
A device according to one of Claims 6 to 10, characterised 
in that the drive (motor 11) for adjusting the height of the 

strip (5) is used at the same time to extend and retract the 
roof aerial (17).
