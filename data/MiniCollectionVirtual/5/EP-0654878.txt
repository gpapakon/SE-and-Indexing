<ABSTRACT>
Electrical cable-holder raceway with a cover 
which can be removed only by means of tools, comprising 

a duct element which is provided with a base and two 
lateral walls, and a cover which comprises a closing 

plane and two lateral limbs; at their free edge the 
lateral walls of the duct have a groove or pocket with a 

substantially G-shaped profile, and on their free end the 
lateral limbs of the cover have a wedge-shaped protrusion 

to be inserted in the groove, and on the inner surface of 
the lateral limbs there is a toothed projection which 

cooperates with the free end of the G-shaped groove.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cable-holder 
raceways with a cover for electrical cables or the like. Cable-holder raceways are known which are provided 
with a cover in which the cover is rendered integral 
with the raceway by means of inclusion of projections 
which exist in the cover, in a groove which exists 
on the inner walls of the raceway. In general however 
this type of closure can be forced simply by means of 
pressure applied to the lateral wall of the raceway. By 
this means, the cables contained therein are also accessible 
to people who are not qualified for maintenance, for 
example those who are inexpert, or more dangerously 
still, children. Patents FR-A-2406327 and DE-OE-2516404 propose 
technical solutions for eliminating these problems. 
However both these solutions are based on the creation of 
a pair of fins which project from the inner side of the 
cover, and which are intended to engage with the elements 
of the raceway walls. These solutions are therefore 
complex and costly. The object of the present invention is thus to 
provide a raceway which has a cover of a simple and 
economical design, in which the cover can be removed only 
by means of tools, and thus cannot be opened accidentally 
or by being forced by unqualified people. For this purpose, a raceway is provided with a 
cover which can be removed only by means of tools, 
comprising a raceway with a base which can be connected 
to a surface, and two lateral walls, and a cover which 
comprises a closing plane and two lateral limbs, 
characterized in that on their free edge opposite the  
 
base, the lateral walls of the raceway each have a groove 
with a substantially G-shaped profile, and on their free 
end the lateral limbs of the cover have a wedge-shaped 
protrusion to be inserted in the groove, and a toothed 
projection on the inner surface of the limb which cooperates 
with the upper free end of the G-shaped groove. Further advantages and features will become 
apparent from the following detailed description of an 
embodiment of the present invention, provided by way of 
non-limiting example, with reference to the attached 
drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a transverse cross-section of the 
raceway with a cover according to the invention, shown in 
the closing stage; and Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 with the 
closing operation completed. In Figure 1, 1 designates the cable-holder 
raceway according to the invention. This raceway comprises 
a base 101 which can be connected to the surface 
on which the

Electrical cable-holder raceway or the like with 
a cover which can be removed only by means of tools, 

comprising a duct element (1) which is provided with a 
base (101) and two lateral walls (201), and a cover (2) 

which comprises a closing plane (102) and two lateral

the lateral walls (201) of the raceway (1) have a groove 
or pocket (301) with a substantially G-shaped profile 

which is integral with the internodal body of the 
raceway, and on their free end the lateral limbs (202) of 

the cover have a wedge-shaped protrusion (332) to be 
inserted in the groove, and a toothed projection (312) in 

the inner surface of the lateral limb (202), which cooperates 
with the free end (341) of the G-shaped groove 

(301), rendering it resiliently taut during the stage of 
locking of the cover (2).
