<ABSTRACT>
A deep bed upflow filter (10) for removing suspended solids from an influent stream to provide a clean filtrate, comprising an upright vessel (12) having a vertical axis (14), top and bottom ends (16, 18) and contiguous upper (20), lower (22), and intermediate (24) regions between the ends. The upper region contains filtrate (26) up to a first elevation (28) and an outlet (30) for drawing the filtrate out of the vessel. The intermediate region contains particulate filter media (32) for removing the suspended solids from influent moving upwardly through the media as the media, dirtied with solids, moves downwardly into the lower region. The lower region is generally tapered (36) inwardly toward the vessel bottom and contains dirty media (34) that has moved downwardly from the intermediate region. Influent is introduced (44) between the intermediate and lower regions, and the dirty media is collected (46) at the bottom and transported (50) to a regenerative washing compartment (52). A portion of the reject flow (64) from the wash compartment is delivered (72, 74) to the dirty media in the lower region of the vessel and another portion (72, 78) is delivered to the area (46, 48, 50) where the dirty media is collected and transported. This latter portion is preferably introduced into a collection conduit (46) through a pipe (130) having a concentric inner tube (140) by which air is injected to fluidize and move the mixture of air, dirty media, and reject water in the conduit (46) toward an airlift (48, 148).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a regenerative deep bed water
filter unit including an upright vessel, an upper region
in the vessel containing filtrate, an intermediate region
containing particulate filter media for removing suspended
solids from upflowing influent, a lower region containing
dirty filter media, wherein the filter media in the intermediate
region and the dirty filter media in the lower region
are part of a filter bed, means for introducing influent between
the intermediate and lower regions, regeneration means
for withdrawing dirty media from the lower region and transporting,
washing, and reintroducing the withdrawn media into
the intermediate region, the regeneration means including
wash means situated in the upper region, for continuously receiving
a flow of dirty media, removing the suspended solids
from the flow of dirty media, and depositing cleaned media
into the intermediate region , means for drawing wash reject
out of the regeneration means, and means for drawing filtrate
from the upper region out of the vessel, wherein said wash
means includes a compartment that has a compartment inlet below
the filtrate level in the vessel; said compartment including
an outlet from the vessel at an elevation above the
compartment inlet but not above the filtrate level of the
vessel and means defining a wash path between said compartment
inlet and outlet, for flowing a portion of the filtrate
which has passed upwardly through the filter bed, from the
compartment inlet to the outlet while the transported dirty
media moves through the compartment toward said compartment
inlet, whereby the suspended solids are carried by said filtrate
portion along the wash path and out of the vessel as a
flow of wash reject. For many years, deep beds of sand, or other fine
particulates, have been utilized for filtering relatively
large quantities of liquid, for example, the secondary
treatment of industrial waste water or the like. In the
most primitive deep bed sand filters, the filtered solids
which have been "trapped" among the sand particulates, can
be removed from the filter only by throwing away the
"dirty" sand.In more advanced filters, the filter media has been
conserved by a variety of techniques most of which draw the
dirty sand from the bottom of the filter vessel and pass
the dirty sand through a media washing chamber situated
either externally or internally of the vessel.In one type of regenerative filter, the influent is
introduced in the upper portion of the filter vessel above
the sand bed, and
