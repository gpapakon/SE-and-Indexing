segments being counterparts of each other, the outward 

segment acting to convey the products (12), refrigeration 
means, belt feeder means and means to feed (16) and to 

remove (21) the products (12) being included, the endless 
belt (18) being a belt having an endless smooth supporting 

surface without holes or openings and consisting of cloth or 
of a plastic or composite material, the endless belt (18)

spiral having the same geometric parameters as the spiral of 
the tunnel (17), the endless belt (18) having its loading 

edge and delivery edge in a selected radial position defined

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a spiral refrigerator tunnel for
foodstuffs products coated with chocolate or substances of
an analogous type, as set forth in the main claim.To be more exact, the invention concerns a spiral
refrigerator tunnel suitable to cool foodstuffs products
coated with chocolate or substances of an analogous type in
line immediately downstream of the step of partial or total
pouring or coating and also suitable to discharge in line
the cooled products towards the subsequent processes and/or
towards the packaging machine.In the description that follows, by "coated foodstuffs
products" we shall always means foodstuffs products coated
with chocolate or substances of an analogous type.The field of production of coated foodstuffs products of
the state of the art covers the problems encountered in the
cooling process required to bring the coating layer to a
solidified condition.The products to be coated, immediately after having passed
through the coating station, where they are lapped by a jet
of coating product in the melted state or where they are
dipped in a bath of the coating product, are delivered
continuously or substantially continuously into a
refrigerator tunnel suitable to bring the coating layer to
the solid state.When solidification of the coating layer has been
completed, the coated foodstuffs products are again sent
continuously or substantially continuously towards the
successive processes or directly to the packaging machine.The path of the product within the refrigerator tunnel has 
a length which in coordination with the speed of feed
corresponds to the minimum time needed to accomplish
solidification of the coating layer according to the
requirements made necessary by the characteristics of the
coating product.The speed of feed through the refrigerator tunnel involves
constraints linked to the speed of feed upstream and
downstream of the tunnel so as not to impair the
productivity of the plant.The majority of the refrigerator tunnels employed nowadays
in the field of production of coated foodstuffs products are
of a linear type with a substantially horizontal
development.Owing to the above requirements of productivity and to the
solidification characteristics of the substances most often
employed for the coating layer, such as chocolate or
analogous substances for instance, the linear refrigerator
tunnels employed to produce coated foodstuffs products have
very great lengths.To keep the output of the plant high, the length of these
linear tunnels may reach thirty to fifty
