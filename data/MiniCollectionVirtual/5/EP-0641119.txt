<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile printer in which sets of one or two pels 
contiguous to longer lines of such pels are reduced or 

eliminated. When reduced, the reduced pels are 
positioned contiguous to the longer line and are 

extended one pel on each side where the longer line 
exists. This reduces scanner errors and significantly 

improves images. Gray effects from dithering are not 
significantly affected when the pels are reduced and 

spread. When the image is graphic or otherwise more 
random than text scanned in the line and column 

direction, the correction may be deactivated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the printing of images scanned
at a distant location and transmitted over a
communication link to a receiving printer, broadly
termed facsimile. Such images are degraded by the
scanning process. This invention relates to such
applications in which the image is digitized as a bit
map at least at the printing station. Such bit maps
include bits of information which constitute errors
introduced by the scanning.Facsimile systems are now well known, and this invention
may be employed with any such system in which the final
printing is defined by a bit map and in which the bit
map may be modified before printing in accordance with
this invention.Modification of bit maps before printing is now well
established, both for printers operating from highly
accurate bit map data and for facsimile receivers. The
modification is to eliminate the stairstep appearance of
diagonal lines which results from printing which is
applied to fill in certain bit locations and to leave
the remaining bit locations entirely blank.
Commercially, this modification is often described as
enhancing the resolution of the printer. U.S. Patents
No. 4,437,122 to Walsh et al and 4,975,785 to Kantor are
representative of such enhancement of resolution in
printers. U.S. Patents No. 5,060,082 to Matsumoto et al
and 5,117,294 to Yano show such enhancement of
resolution in facsimile receivers.This invention modifies the bit map of an image to
correct errors. U.S. Patent No. 4,646,355 to Petrick et 
al teaches modification of such a bit map to remove
small dots and voids. U.S. Patent No. 5,153,748 to
Moyer is to the removal of gaps in such images. U.S.
Patent No. 5,151,794 to Kumagai teaches modification of
such a bit map by determining a medium value for a group
of pels.According to one aspect, the invention provides an
imaging apparatus (1) for receiving image data subject to
degradation and produce a visual image-based on said
image data, said apparatus comprising examining means (17) for
examining a bit map of said data, said bit map having
lines corresponding to lines of text and lines
corresponding to columns of text, correcting means (17) for correcting
said bit map in response to the content of said examining means
and producing means (5,7,9) for producing said visual image
from said corrected bit map, characterised in that:
   said correcting means is adapted to identify sets of either one
or two contiguous pels of the same significance, said
sets being either in a horizontal line and contiguous
with a horizontal

An imaging apparatus (1) for receiving image data
subject to degradation and producing a visual image based

on said image data, said apparatus comprising examining means (17) for
examining a bit map of said data, said bit map having

lines corresponding to lines of text and lines
corresponding to columns of text, correcting means (17) for correcting

said bit map in response to the content of said examining means
and producing means (5,7,9) for producing said visual image

from said corrected bit map, characterised in that:

   said correcting means is adapted to identify sets of either one
or two contiguous pels of the same significance, said

sets being either in a horizontal line and contiguous
with a horizontal line of pels of the same significance

extending at least one pel on at least one side of said set,
or being in a vertical line and contiguous with a

vertical line of pels of the same significance extending
at least one pel on at least one side of said set, said

sets being otherwise surrounded by pels of the other
significance, and in that said correcting means is adapted either to

replace substantially all said sets with pels of the
other significance, or to reduce said sets in the same

significance, said reduced pels being located
substantially contiguous with said horizontal or

vertical line with which said set is contiguous.
The imaging apparatus as in claim 1 in which said
imaging apparatus (1) comprises means (3,19) for receiving

said image data from a distant point.
The imaging apparatus as in claim 1 or 2 also
comprising control means (20) for bringing said imaging

apparatus to a first status in which said visual image
is produced from said corrected bit map and for bringing

said imaging apparatus to a second status in which said
visual image is produced from said bit map not corrected 

by said correcting means.
The imaging apparatus as in claim 1, 2 or 3 in
which substantially all of said pels which are replaced

or reduced are reduced and one such reduced pel is added
on either side of said reduced pels contiguous with the

line with which said set is contiguous.
The imaging apparatus as preceding claim in
which said examining means (17) is adapted to examine said bit map

of said data in resolution of at least as fine as about
203 by 98 dots per inch (80 by 39 dots per cm).
The imaging apparatus as in any preceding claim in
which said received image is digitally scanned data.
A method of receiving image data subject to
degradation and producing a visual image based on said

image data, comprising the steps of:

examining a bit map of said data, said bit map
having lines corresponding to lines of text and lines

corresponding to columns of text, and
correcting said bit map in response to said
examining step and producing a visual image from said

corrected bit map, characterised in that said correcting
step further comprises the steps of:
identifying sets of either one or two contiguous
pels of the same significance, said sets being either in

a horizontal line and contiguous with a horizontal line
of pels of the same significance extending at least one

pel on at least one side of said set, or being in a vertical
line and contiguous with a vertical line of pels of the

same significance extending at least one pel on at least

one side of said set, said sets being otherwise
surrounded by pels of the other significance, and either

replacing substantially all said sets with pels of the
other significance, or reducing said sets in the same 

significance, said reduced pels being located
substantially contiguous with said horizontal or

vertical line with which said set is contiguous.
