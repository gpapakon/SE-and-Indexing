<ABSTRACT>
Stock solutions of polyhydroxy fatty acid amide surfactants at high concentrations are characterized by their unfortunate tendency to thicken, or gel, on storage. Mild heating and the inclusion of carboxylates such as oxydisuccinate, citrate or tartrate-succinate maintain the viscosity of such solutions below about 2,000 centipoise, even at temperatures around 30  DEG C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process improvement 
relating to the manufacture of detergent compositions, especially 
laundry and dishwashing detergents. The manufacturer may find it desirable to add any number of 
detersive and aesthetic ingredients to modern laundry detergent 
compositions using various handling techniques. For example, some 
sensitive ingredients such as enzymes and perfumes may be added by 
dry-mixing or by spraying onto a final granular product. The 
formulation of liquid detergents can involve various batch or 
continuous processes which may include various solubilizing, 
mixing, pH-adjusting, etc., steps. Such procedures have become 
well-known and commonplace in the detergent industry, and various 
batch, continuous and mixed continuous/batch processes for the 
manufacture of detergent compositions are currently in use. Depending on the method of manufacture, the type of detergent 
composition being manufactured and the available equipment, it may 
be desirable for the manufacturer to employ various ingredients as 
stock solutions which are in fluid form. This is especially true 
when formulating liquid detergents. Typically, fluid forms of 
detersive ingredients comprise water or water-alcohol as the 
fluidizing medium in which the desired ingredients can be dissolved 
or slurried. While detersive surfactants are mainly water-soluble, it is 
well-known to those skilled in the detergency arts that various 
surfactants often form quite viscous fluids, or even high 
viscosity pasty masses or gels, when added to water at high 
concentrations. Such high viscosity materials can be difficult to 
work with in a manufacturing plant. Of course, one simple method  
 
to avoid handling problems is either to work with such surfactants 
in their substantially dry, solid state, to use them in a more 
dilute, more easily handleable, fluid form, or to heat them to 
provide fluidity. However, in the event the manufacturer wishes to employ 
surfactants in the form of fluids which are stable and relatively 
highly concentrated, it is generally advantageous to adjust such 
fluids so that they are easier to handle, especially with regard 
to their ability to be pumped using conventional pumping equipment. 
On the other hand, it would be undesirable to add any 
ingredients to such surfactant-containing fluids which could not 
be tolerated in the finished detergent compositions, since to do 
so would require additional steps in the overall manufacturing 
process to remove such unwanted

effective, viscosity controlling amount of a carboxylate 

functional material to said isotropic solution of 
polyhydroxy fatty acid amide, whereby the viscosity of 

said solution remains at a pumpable viscosity.
