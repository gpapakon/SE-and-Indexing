<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to aircraft gas turbine engines, and, more 
specifically, to a rotor support system thereof. Aircraft gas turbine engines include two or more rotors supported by stationary 
frames thereof. The rotors carry fan, compressor, and turbine blades having radially outer 
tips disposed closely adjacent to stationary shrouds for maintaining relatively small blade 
tip clearances therebetween. Small tip clearances are desired for minimizing the leakage 
of the motive fluids therepast which decreases efficiency of operation of the engine. 
Accordingly, the several rotors should be supported in bearings as rigidly as possible for 
minimizing elastic deflections thereof which can undesirably vary the blade tip clearances 
as is conventionally known. In one type of gas turbine engine, a counter-rotating power turbine is provided 
downstream of the core engine for driving forward and aft fan blades either disposed at the 
forward end of the engine or the aft end of the engine as is conventionally known. Each 
of the counter-rotating turbine rotors includes a respective plurality of rotor blades 
extending therefrom in predetermined numbers of axial 
stages. Gas turbine engines of this kind are described in 
GB-A-586,570 and US-A-3,903,690. The blade tip clearances at 
the bottom of the outer rotor blades and at the top of the inner rotor blades are affected by 
in-plane bending moments of the two rotors due to the various forces encountered during 
operation of the engine, with it being desirable to control such blade tip clearances by 
suitably supporting the rotors to stationary frames. A stationary mid-frame disposed 
between the core engine and the power turbine, and a stationary rear frame disposed aft 
of the power turbine are conventionally known and used in various configurations for 
supporting the power turbine rotors. However, improved support of the power turbine 
rotors against deflections due to in-plane bending moments is desired for improving the 
cooperation of the power turbine with the core engine for improving efficiency of operation 
thereof.  
 A gas turbine engine rotor support system includes outer and inner rotors having 
respective outer and inner blades interdigitated in respective blade row stages. A stationary 
rear frame includes a rear support shaft. A rotatable aft frame is disposed forwardly of the 
rear frame and includes an aft support shaft. And, a rotatable forward frame is disposed 
forwardly of the aft frame and includes a forward support
