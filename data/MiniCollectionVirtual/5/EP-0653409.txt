<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing tertiary butyl alcohol wherein a 
feedstock comprising a solution of tertiary butyl 

hydroperoxide in a cosolvent mixture of tertiary butyl 
alcohol with isobutane is charged to a hydroperoxide 

decomposition reaction zone containing a catalytically 
effective amount of a hydroperoxide decomposition catalyst 

and is brought into contact with the catalyst in liquid 
phase with agitation under hydroperoxide decomposition 

reaction conditions to convert the tertiary butyl 
hydroperoxide to decomposition products, principally 

tertiary butyl alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the preparation of
tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) by the catalytic decomposition of
tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). More particularly, this
invention relates to a method wherein a tertiary butyl
hydroperoxide charge stock comprising a solution of tertiary
butyl hydroperoxide dissolved in a cosolvent mixture of
isobutane and tertiary butyl alcohol is brought into contact
with a hydroperoxide decomposition catalyst in a reaction zone
to convert the tertiary butyl hydroperoxide to peroxide
decomposition products, principally tertiary butyl alcohol.It is known to react isobutane with oxygen, either
thermally or catalytically, to form a peroxidation reaction
product wherein the principal peroxide that is formed is
tertiary butyl hydroperoxide. It is also known to thermally
or catalytically decompose the tertiary butyl hydroperoxide in
a peroxide decomposition zone to form tertiary butyl alcohol.
Normally, the unreacted isobutane is removed from the peroxidation
reaction product so that the feedstock for the
hydroperoxide decomposition zone is a debutanized peroxidation
reaction product.In the text entitled "Organic Peroxides" edited by Daniel
Swern (Wiley Interscience, a Division of John Wiley & Sons,
New York), in Vol. II on page 157 it is stated that the
metal-ion-catalyzed decomposition of primary hydroperoxides
yields mainly alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids, citing 
as an example the decomposition of hydroxymethyl hydroperoxide
with aqueous ferrous sulfate to provide formaldehyde, formic
acid and water.US-A-3,505,360 discloses a method wherein an alkenyl
hydroperoxide is decomposed in the presence of a catalyst
based on a compound of a Group IV-A, V-A or VI-A metal.
US-A-4,508,923 discloses the use of a catalyst system
comprising ruthenium and chromium for decomposing organic
hydroperoxides. The use of a cobalt borate catalyst for the
decomposition of hydroperoxides is disclosed in
US-A-4,547,598.US-A-4,551,553 is directed to a process for the formation
of alcohols such as tertiary butyl alcohol by the catalytic
decomposition of an organic hydroperoxide such as tertiary
butyl hydroperoxide using a binary catalyst composed of a
mixture of a ruthenium compound with a chromium compound. It
is stated that the use of the binary catalyst eliminates the
need for stabilizing ligands.Sanderson et al. disclose the use of a variety of catalysts
for the decomposition of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide in
a series of U. S. patents, including a catalyst composed of
unsuppo
