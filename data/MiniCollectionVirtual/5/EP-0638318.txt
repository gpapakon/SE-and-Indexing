<ABSTRACT>
Suspensions of echogenic particles in aqueous bioadhesive carriers 
effectively improve imaging by echography of the digestive tract. Affinity of 

the compositions for the gastric mucosa can be adapted to the needs by 
appropriately selecting the carrier in function to its inherent bioadhesive 

capacity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns innocuous ingestible or enterally
administrable compositions which can be used as contrast enhancer media
in ultrasonic echography imaging of the gastro-intestinal tract of animal
and human patients.It is well known that echography belongs to investigative diagnosis
techniques which enable the direct electronic visualization of internal
organs in living beings and is therefore powerful help and guide in
prognosis, medical treatment and surgery. These techniques can often
advantageously supplement or replace X-ray tomography as well as the use
of radio-active tracer compounds which may have obvious undesirable
side-effects.It is also well known that contrast echography relies on the
administration to patients of dispersions or suspensions of echogenically
responsive particles, e.g. microbodies containig air or a gas in a medium,
and thereafter, applying ultrasonic waves which become reflected by said
microbodies to provide desired echographic signals. In this connection, it
has been recognized that air or gas-filled microspheres, e.g. microbubbles or
microballoons, suspended in a liquid are exceptionally efficient ultrasound
reflectors for echography. In this disclosure the term "microbubble"
specifically designates air or gas globules in suspension in a liquid which
generally results from the introduction therein of air or a gas in divided
form, the liquid preferably also containing surfactants or tensides to control
the surface properties and the stability of the bubbles. The term of
"microcapsule" or "microballoon" designates preferably air or gas bodies
with a material boundary envelope, e.g. a polymer membrane wall. Both
microbubbles and microballoons are useful as ultrasonic contrast agents. 
For instance injecting into the blood-stream of living bodies suspensions of
gas microbubbles or microballoons (in the range of 0.5 to 10 Âµm) in a carrier
liquid will strongly reinforce ultrasonic echography imaging, thus aiding in
the visualization of internal organs. Imaging of vessels and internal organs
can strongly help in medical diagnosis, for instance for the detection of
cardiovascular and other diseases.For ultrasonic imaging of the digestive tract, the particulate contrast
agents in the form of gas-filled microspheres or particles are usually
administered orally or rectally, preferably with a carrier.In Biomaterials 11 (1990), 713-717, M.A. Wheatley et al. have reported
the preparation of polymer-coated microspheres by ionotropic gelation of
alginate. The reference
