<ABSTRACT>
Parameters of hydrocarbon-bearing well fluid 
sample are measured while the sample is still in place in a 

well (10) and at downhole pressure and temperature 
conditions, by lowering a tool (18) into the well (10) to a 

downhole location. A well fluid sample is trapped in the 
tool (18) at the downhole location. While the tool (18) 

remains within the well, the volume of the well fluid sample 
is expanded while repeatedly measuring the pressure of the 

trapped well fluid sample at different volumes and thereby 
generating pressure versus volume data for the trapped well 

fluid sample. From this data, various parameters such as 
bubble-point pressure and compressibility of the sample can 

be readily obtained. After each sample is tested, it is 
expelled from the tool so that another sample can be taken. 

The data can be stored for subsequent analysis at the 
surface or it can be transmitted to the surface for real 

time analysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
method of measuring downhole properties of a hydrocarbon-bearing
fluid.It is often desirable in well testing operations to retrieve
downhole fluid samples for inspection and analysis. One portion
of the lab analysis which is usually performed on a sample is a
determination of the physical properties of a sample. One of the
properties which must be determined is the pressure below which
the gas present in an oil sample will begin to leave the single-phase
oil sample and break out of solution, creating a two-phase
oil and gas sample.This pressure is dependent on the temperature of the sample,
and is known as the bubble-point pressure. The bubble-point
pressure of a sample is determined by placing the sample into a
laboratory cell where the heat and pressure can be controlled.
In some cases, a crude bubble-point determination is made at the
well site, at ambient conditions. The determined value of the
bubble point at ambient conditions is then used to extrapolate
or predict the bubble point at downhole temperatures.In any case, the goal is usually to determine the bubble
point for the sample at one or more downhole locations by
estimating what happens to the sample properties under these
conditions or by trying to recreate the downhole conditions. One problem with present methods of determining bubble point
pressure and other sample properties is with the handling of the sample. The
sample is captured downhole, then retrieved to the surface. As the sample is
retrieved to surface, it cools down and the sample pressure drops. In some
samples, irreversible chemical changes occur as the sample cools down. This
problem is unavoidable with present methods.Another problem which can arise with present sampling techniques,
is sample degradation due to long-term storage at ambient conditions. It often takes
a long time for samples to be shipped from the well site to a lab for analysis.Human error in the processes described above can also result in
sample corruption, contamination or degradation in some other way. Unclean
sample bottles, lab equipment, etc., can also degrade the sample.US-A-4782695 relates to the measurement of the bubble point of oil
down a well drilled into an underground formation. The apparatus disclosed in
US-A-4782695 comprises a chamber in which a small quantity of oil is confined in
a volume which is variable by a needle having portions of different diameters
capable of being inserted to a greater or lesser extent into the chamber under drive

A method of measuring a parameter of a hydrocarbon bearing well fluid, which
method comprises:


(a) lowering a testing tool (18) to a downhole location within a well;
(b) trapping a well fluid sample in said tool at said downhole location; and
(c) while said tool remains within said well:
