<ABSTRACT>
The porous support formed from a ceramic fibrous structure in which the cavities are packed with alumina powder is filled with a compound in the liquid state, such as zirconium propylate, which, on hydrolysis and polycondensation, gives rise to a gel whose thermal decomposition produces in its turn a ceramic oxide (zirconium oxide) which sinters at a higher temperature than the powder and consequently reduces the sintering shrinkage of the latter.

A process for the preparation of a ceramic material, in
which a coherent porous ceramic support comprising a

ceramic powder is prepared, a liquid containing at least
one ceramic precursor is introduced into the voids in this

support and this combination is subjected to a
consolidation and/or densification operation at the

temperature necessary for sintering of the powder,
characterised in that the ceramic material resulting from

the transformation of at least one precursor has a higher
sintering temperature than that of said ceramic powder and

does not react with the latter during this consolidation
and/or densification operation, such that the contraction

of said powder and of said ceramic material is limited.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the liquid-impregnated support is brought into contact with

a reagent in the fluid state which participates in said
transformation by producing polymerisation or

polycondensation of the precursor.
A process according to claim 2, characterised in that
the action of said reagent with respect to the precursor

initially causes an increase in the viscosity of said
liquid.
A process according to claim 3, characterised in that
said reagent is selected from water, oxygen, ammonia,

acetic acid, hydrogen sulphide and polyols.
A process according to either one of claims 3 and 4,
characterised in that said liquid consists substantially of

said precursor(s).
A process according to any one of claims 3 to 5,
characterised in that the precursor is an organometallic

(organic metal) compound of the alcoholate or metalloxane
type or the like, resulting, by hydrolysis and 

polycondensation, in a gel the thermal decomposition of
which in turn produces a refractory ceramic compound

constituting said ceramic material.
A process according to claim 6, characterised in that
the precursor used is an organometallic compound of

zirconium and/or an organometallic compound of aluminium.
A process according to claim 7, characterised in that
the precursor used is zirconium propylate and/or aluminium

butylate.
A process according to claim 6, characterised in that
the precursor used is a polysilane and/or a polycarbosilane

and/or a polysilazane.
A process according to any one of claims 6 to 9,
characterised in that at least one alcoholate of a metal

selected from iron, chromium, cobalt, lanthanides,
actinides, noble earths and refractory metals other than

zirconium and aluminium is also used as a precursor.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it comprises successive cycles

involving impregnation by a liquid, which may be identical
or different from one cycle to the next and which contains

at least one ceramic precursor, the first cycle being
carried out on the original porous support and each of the

subsequent cycles being carried out on the support which
has already been impregnated and subjected to at least part

of said heat treatment following the preceding
impregnation.
A process according to claim 11, characterised in that,
at the time of at least one of said subsequent cycles, the

liquid contains a precursor of an additive suitable for
modifying the properties of said ceramic material. 
A process according to claim 12, characterised in that
said additive precursor is selected from the compound

 and the ethylates of cerium, hafnium,
yttrium and germanium.
A process according to claim 11 in conjunction with
claim 5, or according to either one of claims 12 and 13,

characterised in that said cycles are followed by
additional cycles comprising impregnation by a low

viscosity liquid solution of at least one precursor forming
by heat treatment a refractory mineral material.
A process according to claim 14, characterised in that
said liquid solution contains as precursor at least one

salt of a metal resulting in an oxide the melting point of
which is higher than 1600°C, in particular an aluminium

salt, a zirconium salt, a cobalt salt or a chromium salt.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the support comprises ceramic fibres

immersed in said ceramic powder.
A process according to claim 16, characterised in that
the fibres are of at least one material selected from

carbon, silicon carbide, boron, boron nitride, silicon
nitride, mullite and alumina, yttrium aluminate, and

oxynitrides and oxycarbides of silicon and/or aluminium
and/or titanium.
A process according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the ceramic powder is of at least one

material the melting point of which is higher than 1700°C,
in particular alumina, magnesium, mullite, zirconia,

zircon, hafnium oxide, titanium oxide, titanium zirconate,
titanium aluminate, yttrium aluminate, lanthanum chromite,

chromium oxide, cobalt oxide, noble earth and lanthanide
oxides, uranium oxide or actinide oxides.
