<ABSTRACT>
A color photographic element having a support bearing at least one radiation sensitive emulsion layer comprising dispersing medium and silver halide grains is disclosed. The emulsion layer is a tabular grain silver halide emulsion layer wherein at least 50 percent of total grain projected area is accounted for by tabular grains (a) bounded by [100] major faces having adjacent edge ratios of less than 10, (b) each having an aspect ratio of at least 2, and (c) internally at their nucleation site, containing iodide and at least 50 mole percent chloride. The emulsion layer has in reactive association an image dye-forming compound and a compound that contains a photographically useful group and is capable of reacting with oxidized developing agent to thereby release such group. A process for preparing the radiation sensitive tabular grain silver halide emulsions is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to color photographic
elements comprising radiation sensitive tabular grain
silver halide emulsion layers.During the 1980's a marked advance took place
in silver halide photography based on the discovery that
a wide range of photographic advantages, such as improved
speed-granularity relationships, increased covering power
both on an absolute basis and as a function of binder
hardening, more rapid developability, increased thermal
stability, increased separation of native and spectral
sensitization imparted imaging speeds, and improved image
sharpness in both mono- and multi-emulsion layer formats,
could be achieved by employing tabular grain emulsions.An emulsion is generally understood to be a
"tabular grain emulsion" when tabular grains account for
at least 50 percent of total grain projected area. A
grain is generally considered to be a tabular grain when
the ratio of its equivalent circular diameter (ECD) to
its thickness (t) is at least 2. The equivalent circular
diameter of a grain is the diameter of a circle having an
area equal to the projected area of the grain. The term
"intermediate aspect ratio tabular grain emulsion" refers
to an emulsion which has an average tabular grain aspect
ratio in the range of from 5 to 8. The term "high aspect
ratio tabular grain emulsion" refers to an emulsion which
has an average tabular grain apsect ratio of greater than
8. The term "thin tabular grain" is generally understood
to be a tabular grain having a thickness of less than
0.2 µm. The term "ultrathin tabular grain" is generally 
understood to be a tabular grain having a thickness of
0.06 m or less. The term "high chloride" refers to
grains that contain at least 50 mole percent chloride
based on silver. In referring to grains of mixed halide
content, the halides are named in order of increasing
molar concentrations--e.g., silver iodochloride contains
a higher molar concentration of chloride than iodide.The overwhelming majority of tabular grain
emulsions contain tabular grains that are irregular
octahedral grains. Regular octahedral grains contain
eight identical crystal faces, each lying in a different
{111} crystallographic plane. Tabular irregular
octahedra contain two or more parallel twin planes that
separate two major grain faces lying in {111}
crystallographic planes. The {111} major faces of the
tabular grains exhibit a threefold symmetry, appearing
triangular or hexagonal. It is generally accepted that
the tabular shape of the grains is the result of the twin
planes
