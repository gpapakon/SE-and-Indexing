<ABSTRACT>
A drill bit has a plurality of radial blades 
(12,14,16,18,20,22) on its leading face which define 

fluid channels (24,26,28,30,32,34) leading to junk slots 
(36,38,40,42,44,46) in the gauge region, cutting 

elements (23) being mounted along each blade. At least 
two of the channels (24,26) are in communication with 

one another at their inner ends and there is provided, 
at the communicating inner ends of the channels, an 

inner nozzle (48) which is angled to direct the majority 
of drilling fluid emerging from the nozzle outwardly 

along one of the channels (24). An outer nozzle (54) is 
located in the other channel (26), adjacent its junk 

slot (38), and is angled so that the majority of fluid 
emerging from the outer nozzle flows inwardly along said 

other channel (26) and towards the inner nozzle (48).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to rotary drill bits for
use in drilling holes in subsurface formations and
particularly to drag type drill bits of the kind
comprising a bit body having a leading face and a gauge
region, a plurality of blades formed on the leading face
of the bit and extending outwardly away from the axis of
the bit towards the gauge region so as to define between
the blades a plurality of fluid channels leading to junk
slots in the gauge region, a plurality of cutting
elements mounted along each blade, and a plurality of
nozzles in the leading face of the bit for supplying
drilling fluid to the channels for cleaning and cooling
the cutting elements.One of the major problems in designing a drill
bit of this type lies in positioning and orientating the
nozzles so as to provide the most effective flow pattern
of drilling fluid along the channels and across the
cutting elements to obtain the optimum cleaning and
cooling effect. The flow of drilling fluid emerging
from the nozzles and impinging on the surface of the
formation being drilled also serves to cool the
formation.Normally the nozzles are located in the area
around the central axis of rotation of the bit so that
substantially all of the drilling fluid emerging from
the nozzles flows outwardly along the channels with
which each nozzle communicates, so as to wash over the 
cutting elements facing into the channels. Arrangements
are known in which these nozzles are slightly angled
with respect to the surface of the bit body so that the
drilling fluid emerges from the nozzle in a direction
having a component along a particular channel. However,
where a nozzle is feeding two or more channels it may be
undesirable to direct the flow along a particular
channel.Another requirement for the flow of drilling
fluid is effectively to remove and clear from the
channels the cuttings which are removed from the
formation by the cutting element as drilling proceeds.
In soft and sticky formations there may be a tendency
for such cuttings to accumulate or "ball" in the
channels and it is necessary that the flow of drilling
fluid should be capable of preventing or clearing such
accumulations since otherwise the cutting elements
facing into a blocked channel may become ineffective for
drilling.Many different designs of drill bit, and
arrangements of nozzles, have been proposed in an
endeavour to meet these requirements. In European
Specification No. 0119239 there is shown an arrangement
in which nozzles are provided near the outer periphery
of the drill bit

A rotary drill bit for use in drilling holes
in subsurface formations comprising a bit body (10)

having a leading face and a gauge region, a plurality of
blades (12,14,16,18,20,22) formed on the leading face of

the bit and extending outwardly away from the axis of
the bit towards the gauge region so as to define between

the blades a plurality of fluid channels
(24,26,28,30,32,34) leading to junk slots

(36,38,40,42,44,46) in the gauge region, a plurality of
cutting elements (23) mounted along each blade, and a

plurality of nozzles (48,50,52,54,56,58) in the leading
face of the bit for supplying drilling fluid to the

channels for cleaning and cooling the cutting elements,
characterised in that at least two of said channels

(24,26) are in communication with one another at their
inner ends and both lead to respective junk slots

(36,38) at their outer ends, and wherein there is
provided, in the vicinity of said communicating inner

ends of the channels, an inner nozzle (48) which is
angled with respect to the surface of the bit body to

direct drilling fluid in a direction having a component
outwardly along one of said two channels, so as to

direct the majority of fluid emerging from said nozzle
outwardly along said one channel (24), and an outer

nozzle (54), located in the other of said two channels

(26) adjacent the respective junk slot (38), and angled
with respect to the surface of the bit body to direct 

drilling fluid in a direction having a component
inwardly along said other channel (26), so that the

majority of fluid emerging from said outer nozzle flows
inwardly along said other channel (26) and towards said

inner nozzle (46).
A rotary drill bit according to Claim 1,
characterised in that said inner nozzle (48) is angled

to direct drilling fluid along said one channel (24) in
a direction which is generally parallel to the blade

(12) along which are mounted the plurality of cutting
elements (23) which face into said one channel (24).
A rotary drill bit according to Claim 1 or
Claim 2, characterised in that the centreline of the

flow (74) of drilling fluid from said inner nozzle (48)
impinges on the formation, in use, at a radial distance

(80) from the central axis of rotation of the drill bit
which is greater than the radial distance from the axis

of the inner end (82) of the other blade (14) along
which said channel (24) extends.
A rotary drill bit according to any of Claims
1 to 3, characterised in that the inner nozzle (48) is

located as close to the central axis of rotation of the
drill bit as permitted by the location of the blades

(12,16) and cutting elements (23).
