<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to blocking gels
of the type used in well bore operations and
particularly to a method for producing a gradual
reduction in the viscosity of a blocking gel through
the use of enzymes either incorporated internally
within the blocking gel or placed externally on the
blocking gel.Occasionally, production from well bore
operations must cease temporarily to perform
auxiliary procedures such as repairs at different
depths of a subterranean formation. The repairs are
called workover operations. Workover operations
frequently use heavy brines and other fluids to
maintain pressure control within the reservoir. The
fluids can leak-off into the production zone, causing
damage which interferes with the efficient operation
of the well.Isolating the production zone, however, protects
it from damage. Specific blocking materials such as
solid blocking agents or temporary blocking gels
isolate the production formation. The solid blocking
agents, for example nylon or rubber balls, are
injected into the fluid stream and seal the
production formation by physically stopping up
perforations in the formation. When the injection 
ends, the material is no longer held against the
perforations and falls to the bottom of the well.The use of temporary blocking gels successfully
protects the production zone. Blocking gels form by
gellation of suitable polymers, such as appropriate
polysaccharides. These gels produce a relatively
impermeable barrier across the production formation.
The barrier cordons off the production zone from the
area undergoing the workover operations. The areas
must remain separated until production is ready to
resume.Production resumes after removal of the blocking
gel. The recovery of the blocking gel is
accomplished by reducing the viscosity of the fluid
to a low value such that it flows naturally from the
formation under the influence of formation fluids and
pressure. This viscosity reduction or conversion is
referred to as "breaking" and is often accomplished
by incorporating chemical agents, referred to as
breakers, into the initial gel.In addition to the importance of providing a
breaking mechanism for the gelled fluid which
facilitates recovery of the fluid and resumes
production, the timing of the break is of great
importance. Gels which break prematurely can damage
the production zone through the leak-off of
contaminating materials into the production
formation.On the other hand, gelled fluids which break too
slowly can cause slow recovery of the blocking gel
fluid from

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a temporary blocking gel within
a well bore within a subterranean formation, the method

comprising:

formulating a gellable blocking fluid by blending
together an aqueous fluid, a hydratable cellulose polymer

having repeating units of glucose linked by (1,4)-β-D-glucosidic
linkages, and a suitable crosslinking agent

containing a metal ion selected from the group comprising:
aluminium, antimony, and transition metals, including

zirconium and titanium, for crosslinking the hydratable
polymer to form a polymer gel;
pumping the cross-linked polymer gel to a desired
location within the well bore;
causing the cross-linked polymer to be degraded by a
breaker, whereby the fluid can be removed from the

subterranean formation to the well surface, the breaker
being incorporated internally in the initial gelling fluid

during blending, or applied externally to the previously
cross-linked polymer gel, or both internally incorporated

and externally applied;

   characterised in that the breaker is an enzyme
breaker selected from the group comprising cellulase,

hemicellulases, glucosidases, endo-xylanases, exoxylanases
and combinations thereof, effective to attack

the 1,4-β-D glucosidic linkage in the cross-linked polymer
gel.

breaker is a 1:4 solution of exo(1,4)-β-D-xylanase and

endo(1,4)-β-D-xylanase.
