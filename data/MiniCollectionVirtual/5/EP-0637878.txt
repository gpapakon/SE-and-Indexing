<ABSTRACT>
A signal combiner for use in a space diversity radio receiving system, that accepts two 
signals which have been received at physically diverse locations and which have been converted 

from radio frequency to intermediate frequency. Each signal is checked for signal strength and 
for amplitude versus frequency dispersion, and is run through a separate amplitude slope equalizer 

which removes amplitude slope. Each signal is then run through a separate squelch circuit which 
either attenuates the signal, or passes it on undiminished. The squelch circuits are controlled by 

a control circuit which selectively activates one or neither of the squelch circuits based on the 
difference in signal strength between the two received signals and the signal dispersion of each 

of the signals. The outputs of the squelching circuits are then combined to create a composite 
signal which is comprised of one or both of the equalized signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radio communication systems which transmits a signal 
from one point to another over a certain distance. The signal received at the receiving end is 
often subject to fading and distortion due to environmental effects. The problem called the 
multipath effect is particularly acute for digitally modulated signals. The multipath effect means 
that the signal transmitted from a transmitter can travel to the receiver through a direct path and 
through an indirect path which varies with environmental conditions. As a result the signal which 
is detected at the receiving end can fade over time, and/or the same signal may received at two 
different times due to the difference in time that it took for the signal to travel the indirect path 
versus the direct path. The problem created by the multipath effect can be partially cured by receiving the same 
signal at two different physical locations and then combining the two signals to create a 
composite output. The multipath effect varies from location to location While one location is 
experiencing a multipath fading effect, another nearby location may experience no problem at all. 
Therefore if you receive the same signal at two different locations, chances that both are 
experiencing a multipath fading effect at the same moment is fairly low. By combining the 
signals received from two different locations and creating a composite output, the effects of 
multipath fading can be greatly reduced. To get a single composite signal from two antennas from diverse locations, you must have 
a way to either select one of the two signals or combine the two signals to create a composite 
output. It is known in the art to base a decision of which signal to select on the signal strength 
and also on the amplitude to frequency signal dispersion. It is also known to use the phase 
difference between the two signals which are received at the two diverse locations to decide 
whether or not to combine the two signals. None of the prior art has provided a low cost 
combiner system which operates in the intermediate frequencies which bases its decision on 
whether or not to combine or to select a signal on the signal strength and the amplitude to 
frequency dispersion in which also uses a phase detector to bring the two signals into phase 
alignment. An object of the present invention to provide an intermediate frequency combiner system 
for use in a space diversity radio receiver where the decision of which signal to select or whether  
 
or not
