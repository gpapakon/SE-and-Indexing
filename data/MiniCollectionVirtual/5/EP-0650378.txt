<ABSTRACT>
This invention pertains to the use of a degassed perfluorocarbon ("PFC") liquid as a method of removing gas emboli from parts of a patient's body cava. Moreover, the invention can be used as a method of imaging parts of a patient's body cava. Furthermore, the invention can also be used as a way of delivering biological agents to parts of a patient's body cava which contain or are surrounded by gas emboli and/or which are to be imaged. In this invention, a degassed PFC liquid is delivered to a region within the patient's body cava which contains gas emboli and/or which is to be imaged. If gas emboli are present, the degassed liquid is permitted to absorb at least a portion of the emboli. Thereafter, the emboli-containing liquid is removed from the patient or is used as an imaging agent. If gas emboli are not present, the site is imaged before the degassed liquid reaches atmospheric equilibrium. Thereafter, the liquid is removed from the patient. Moreover, by mixing a biological agent with the degassed PFC liquid, the mixture can be used as a way of topically treating parts within a patient's body cava. Furthermore, by regulating the temperature of the degassed liquid, it can also be used as a way of hypo- or hyperthermically treating the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of degassed perfluorocarbon
liquid ingestion and/or infusion as a means for controlling, treating and/or
diagnosing physiological conditions within a patient. In particular, degassed
perfluorocarbon liquid can be used as a means for imaging parts of a patient's
body cava, as a means for delivering biological agents to parts of a patient's
body cava, and/or as a means for absorbing gas(es) from parts of a patient's
body cava.It is known to use "gassed" (e.g., oxygenated) perfluorocarbon
liquids as a means for delivering gases (e.g., oxygen) to certain parts of a
patient's pulmonary and/or vascular systems. Moreover, it is also known to use
atmospheric-equilibrated perfluorocarbon liquids as a contrast mediums for
imaging purposes.CA 2 035 492 relates to liquid ventilation
of a pulmonary system and discloses the use
of a perfluorocarbon for dissolving gas within
a lung.This invention pertains to novel applications of "degassed" perfluorocarbon
liquids. Specifically, the present invention pertains to using
degassed perfluorocarbon liquids as a means for controlling, treating and/or
diagnosing certain physiological conditions, diseases and/or abnormalities of a
patient which were, heretofore, difficult or impossible to control, treat and/or
diagnose. As used herein, the term "gassed perfluorocarbon liquid" refers
to a perfluorocarbon liquid which has been forced to absorb gas(es) such that
the total concentration of gas contained therein is greater than that present in
the same liquid at atmospheric equilibrium conditions.As used herein, the term "oxygenated perfluorocarbon liquid"
refers to a specific type of gassed perfluorocarbon liquid which has been forced
to absorb oxygen such that the total concentration of oxygen contained therein
is greater than that present in the same liquid at atmospheric equilibrium
conditions.As used herein, the term "degassed perfluorocarbon liquid" refers
to a perfluorocarbon liquid which has been forced to release gas(es) such that
the total concentration of gas contained therein is less than that present in the
same liquid at atmospheric equilibrium conditions.As used herein, the term "atmospheric-equilibrated perfluorocarbon
liquid" refers to a perfluorocarbon liquid having a concentration of gas
contained therein which is substantially the same as that present in the same
liquid prior to being gassed or degassed.As used herein, the term "body cava" refers to cavities, spaces,
voids and/or gaps present in and/or around regions, parts,

<CLAIMS>
Use of a perfluorocarbon liquid for the manufacture of
a degassing agent for use in a process for removing a gas

emboli from a patient's body cava.
Use of a perfluorocarbon liquid as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the process comprises the steps of:


(a) degassing a perfluorocarbon liquid,
(b) delivering the degassed perfluorocarbon liquid to
a region within the patient's body cava which contains a gas

emboli,
(c) permitting the degassed perfluorocarbon liquid to
absorb at least a portion of the gas emboli to form an emboli-containing

perfluorocarbon liquid, and
(d) removing from the patient's body cava the emboli-containing
perfluorocarbon liquid.
Use of a perfluorocarbon liquid according to claim 2,
wherein, prior to step (b), the perfluorocarbon liquid is

heated to a temperature designed to hypothermically treat the
patient.
Use of a perfluorocarbon liquid according to claim 2,
wherein, prior to step (b), the perfluorocarbon liquid is

heated to a temperature designed to hyperthermically treat the
patient.
Use of a perfluorocarbon liquid according to claim 2,
wherein a biological agent is mixed with the perfluorocarbon

liquid prior to step (b) and wherein at least some of the 
biological agent is permitted to be released from the

perfluorocarbon liquid after step (b) but prior to step (d).
Use of a perfluorocarbon liquid according to claim 2,
wherein a biological agent is mixed with the perfluorocarbon

liquid during step (a) and wherein at least some of the
biological agent is permitted to be released from the

perfluorocarbon liquid after step (b) but prior to step (d).
Use of a perfluorocarbon liquid according to claim 2,
wherein a biological agent is mixed with the perfluorocarbon

liquid prior to step (a) and wherein at least some of the
biological agent is permitted to be released from the

perfluorocarbon liquid after step (b) but prior to step (d).
Use of a perfluorocarbon liquid as claimed in any
preceding claim, wherein the body cava is a cavity, space,

void or gap present in or around the patient's
gastrointestinal tract, uterus, bladder, nasal cavity, sinus

cavity or acoustic canal.
Use of a perfluorocarbon liquid for the manufacture of
a degassing agent for use in imaging a patient's body by
