<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron 
multiplier and to a photomultiplier. A conventional electron multiplier constitutes a 
photomultiplier having a photocathode. This electron 
multiplier is constituted by anodes and a dynode unit 
constituted by stacking a plurality of stages of 
dynodes in the incident direction of an electron flow 
in a vacuum container. Each dynode has a connecting 
portion for applying a predetermined voltage. The 
connecting portion and a stem pin connected to an 
external power supply terminal are electrically 
connected by a wiring member, thereby realizing the 
structure for applying a voltage to each dynode. In a broad sense the present invention can be 
said to be based in consideration of the arrangement 
of positions of connecting terminals for applying a 
voltage to plural dynode plates and a connecting pin 
(corresponding to the stem pin) for applying a voltage 
from an external power supply. The invention aims to 
make it unnecessary to use a wiring member whose 
length or shape can be freely changed, or three-dimensionally 
form the wiring member. Conventionally, when the wiring member is used, 
one end of this wiring member and the stem pin, and 
the other end of the wiring member and the connecting  
 
portion must be resistance-welded, respectively. This 
is a factor for decreasing the operation efficiency of 
assembling. As the photomultipliers to be 
manufactured become more compact, this decrease in the 
operation efficiency becomes more conspicuous. Since 
the welding operation requires skills, the operation 
efficiency of assembling is further decreased. The present invention aims to provide a photomultiplier 
having a structure which can facilitate the 
manufacture of even a compact photomultiplier. In an embodiment of the invention the engaging 
member is constituted by a pair of guide pieces for 
directly guiding the connecting pin. Therefore, even 
when the wiring member is connected, it is unnecessary 
to bend the end portion of this wiring member to reach 
the position where the engaging member is provided. According to one aspect of the invention there is 
provided an electron multiplier comprising: an anode 
plate; a dynode unit comprising a plurality of dynode 
plates so spaced apart from each other at 
predetermined intervals and so supported in the stack 
by way of insulating members that the last dynode 
plate of said dynode unit opposes said anode plate to 
enable the dynode unit to effect cascade-multiplying 
of electrons incident
