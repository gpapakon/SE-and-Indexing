<ABSTRACT>
A vertical shaft (17) is pivot mounted on at least one door panel (3) next to one side edge. The shaft is connected to a pinion near its two ends. The other adjacent door panel (2,4), on a level with the pinion(s) has a horizontal toothed batten fixed to it and engaging with the pinion of the shaft pivot mounted on the first door panel. Near the horizontal outer edges of the two door panels is a guide hook (20) on each, which engages with a guide hole (21) along the corresponding horizontal edge of the other door panel, and secures the pinion to the toothed batten.

mutual locking of the horizontal and vertical profile sections (27, 28) which can be screwed to
each other the vertical profile sections have transversely oriented recesses (33) at their ends, the

dimensions of which recesses are matched to the dimensions of the geometry of the external
profile of the horizontal profile sections (27) so that the ends of the horizontal profile sections

can be inserted, before screwing, in the transversely oriented recesses (33) at the ends of the
vertical profile sections (28).
A sliding door according to claim 7, characterised in that the recesses (33) at the ends of
the vertical profile sections (28) are matched to the geometry of the external profile of the ribs

(31) of the horizontal profile sections (27), which ribs delimit the lead-in slot (29).
A sliding door according to any one of claims 6 to 8, characterised in that the vertical
