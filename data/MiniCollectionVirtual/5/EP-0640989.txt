<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for retrofitting nuclear 
fuel assemblies in bottom entry fuel assembly type 

nuclear reactors having a transition piece to guide 
liquid coolant into a channel entry area. The transition 

piece is disposed above an entry orifice in a fuel 
assembly support plate. The transition piece has side 

walls and a multi-pronged lead-in finger. The method 
comprises the steps of removing the lead-in finger from 

the transition piece, machining internal surfaces of the 
side walls of the transition piece and installing an 

insert to be disposed within and supported by the 
machined transition piece. The insert has walls with 

internal surfaces defining a first cylindrical portion 
with a constant diameter at least as large as the 

diameter of the orifice and disposed immediately above 
the orifice for allowing the flow stream from the orifice 

to fully enter the first portion and attach to the inner 
sides of the first portion and an outwardly flaring 

(conical or parabolic) second portion having a diameter 
which increases in the direction of fluid flow for 

allowing controlled expansion of fluid in the transition 
piece.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to the application entitled 
"Improved Transition Piece for Reducing Coolant Pressure 
Drop for Bottom Entry Nuclear Fuel Assemblies" filed 
simultaneous herewith. The present invention relates to coolant flow 
transition pieces in bottom entry fuel assembly design 
reactors and, in particular, a method for modifying the 
design of existing transition pieces in such reactors to 
reduce coolant pressure drop. Figure 1a illustrates a bottom entry fuel 
assembly 10 of the prior art typically used in BWR 
nuclear reactors. The assembly includes a number of 
nuclear fuel rods 11 disposed between upper and lower tie 
plates 12 and 13. The assembly includes at the bottom of 
the lower tie plate a transition section 15 for directing 
coolant into the fuel assembly. The transition section 
15 is better shown in Figure 1b with reference to the 
fuel assembly support plate 18. The transition section, 
hereafter referred to as the transition piece 15, may be 
either separate from the lower tie plate grid or it may 
be integral with the grid, dependent on the designed 
interface with the fuel channel.  Referring to Figure 1b, the transition piece 15 
between the fuel assembly and the fuel supporting plate 
18 in such bottom entry nuclear fuel assemblies is 
subject to certain constraints. The top portion 16 must 
interface with a channel in a prescribed manner and is 
generally square in shape. The portion 17 of the 
transition piece extending downward to the fuel assembly 
support plate 18 in Figure 1b is generally round and must 
seat in a specific diameter opening of specific depth. 
The distance between the fuel assembly support plate 18 
and the fuel assembly itself is defined. Related 
dimensions of one prior art design are also indicated on 
Figure 1b. In this figure, A indicates the portion of 
the transition piece going from round to square. In the prior design as shown in Figures 1a and 
1b, the lower end of the transition piece 15 comprises a 
three-prong lead in finger 19 which is located just above 
the orifice 20 when the transition piece 15 is seated on 
the fuel assembly support plate 18. This prior 
arrangement allowed uncontrolled expansion of the coolant 
flow which resulted in a time varying jet of fluid from 
the orifice. This in turn contributed to fuel rod and 
water rod vibration which resulted in failure of lower 
end caps. In this prior design, in particular, as the 
flow field passes through the opening in the fuel support 
plate, it narrows in diameter and then expands.
