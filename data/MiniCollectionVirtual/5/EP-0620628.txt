a function-specific terminal device (2) with input and/or 

output channels (E1, E2, E3, E4; A1, A2, A3, A4),
 
characterised by the features: 


a board (3), in particular a printed circuit board, is 
provided which connects the bus coupler (1) and the 

terminal device (2), 
a three-terminal line terminal block (4) is provided for 
connecting a supply voltage line (KO), 
a multi-terminal line terminal block (5, 5', 5") is 
provided for connecting up to four connecting lines 

(K1,..K4), 
like terminals (PE, N, L) of both line terminal blocks (4; 
5, 5', 5") are prewired. 
EIB module according to claim 1, characterised by the 
feature: 


at least three terminals (Ax, N, PE; Ex, N, PE) of the 
multi-terminal line terminal block are associated with each 

channel (E1...; A1...). 
EIB module according to claim 2, characterised by the 
feature: 


a voltage supply terminal (L) of the multi-terminal line 
terminal block is additionally associated with the channels 

(E1...; A1...). 
EIB module according to claim 2 or 3, characterised by 
the feature: 


a neutral conductor terminal (N) of the multi-terminal 
line terminal block is additionally associated with the 

channels (E1...; A1...). 
EIB module according to one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised by the feature: 


at least one wire (7.N, 7.L) of the wiring between the two 
terminal blocks (4, 5') is detachable. 
EIB module according to one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised by the features: 


a bottom plate (10) is provided, 
the bottom plate (10) bears at least one strain relief 
(11) for supply lines, connecting lines (KO, K1) and the 

EIBus line. 
EIB module according to claim 6, characterised by the 
feature: 


the bottom plate (10) bears at least one cover retaining 
dome (12). 
EIB module according to claim 6 or 7, characterised by 
the features: 


a hood-like cover (13) is provided,
