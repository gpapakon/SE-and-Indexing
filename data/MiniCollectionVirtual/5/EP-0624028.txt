<ABSTRACT>
Methods and means are described for producing 
intermediary image-bearing signals and/or encoded data, 

compatible for subsequent imaging applications, from 
disparate and inherently incompatible types of input 

imaging devices and media. Application of the methods 
and means of the invention produces intermediary image-bearing 

signals and/or data that can be output onto any 
of a plurality of image-receptive media and/or image-forming 

devices such that any output image will match the 
appearance of any input image. Intermediary data for 

images or portions thereof derived from disparate input 
media and/or devices may be merged together to produce 

composite images of homogeneous and appropriate 
appearance. Intermediary image-bearing signals and/or 

data can also be adjusted and manipulated without 
requiring references to the origin of said signals and/or 

data. Intermediary image-bearing signals and/or data may 
be stored for later use without requiring documentation 

of the origin of the input sources from which they were 
derived.

entitled Methods And
Associated Apparatus for forming Image Data Metrics
which Achieve media Compatibility for Subsequent
Imaging Applications a continuation of an application
filed on December 22, 1989, in the names of E.
Giorgianni and T. Madden; This invention relates generally to color
image reproduction methods and associated apparatus.
More particularly, the invention relates to
reproduction methods and associated apparatus for
producing image color encoding which achieves
compatibility for disparate imaging media used together
for input, output, manipulation and/or storage, when
the intent of said methods and apparatus includes the
retention of the color appearance of input images.Color image reproduction systems known in the
art permit images to be captured by certain image-receptive
media or devices, possibly digitized and
stored, and then output onto complementary media. So,
for instance, color images may be first captured on
negative film and then reproduced on negative
photographic paper. Such images may or may not pass
through a digital intermediary. In another case, color
images may be captured on positive photographic
materials, known as transparencies, and then viewed
directly by projection or back-illumination, or copied
onto larger or smaller transparencies, or printed onto
positive photographic paper. Again, such images may or
may not pass through a digital intermediary. In yet
another case, color images may be captured as an
electronic signal by a video camera, and then viewed on
a video monitor or converted to print by a device such
as a thermal printer. Again, such images may or may
not pass through a digital intermediary. The foregoing
are just some samples of color image reproduction
systems. The application of this invention is not 
limited to the above examples, but may be applied to
other color imaging systems as well, for instance to
the reproduction of reflection originals using

<CLAIMS>
A method for forming a transform (59) for transforming image signals derived
from input images formed by an imaging medium (12, 16, 20, 24) to intermediate

data base color values corresponding to the colorimetric values that
would be required to match, in the viewing condition of a reference viewing

environment, the appearance of the input image as it would appear if viewed in
a specific input viewing environment, comprising the steps of


a) specifying the input viewing environment in terms of its illuminant spectral
power distribiution, amount of viewing flare light, surround, and adaptive

white point chromaticities;
b) specifying the reference viewing environment in terms of its amount of
viewing flare light, surround, and adaptive white point chromaticities;
c) specifying patterns of image-forming values for producing colors which
adequately sample and cover the useful color-range of said imaging

medium (12, 16, 20, 24);
d) forming test colors (46) with said imaging medium (12, 16, 20, 24) using
said image-forming values;
e) determining colorimetric values (48) from said test colors (46) and the input
viewing environment illum
inant spectral power distribution;
f) adjusting said colorimetric values (50) in accordance with the difference in
the amounts of viewing flare light specified for the input viewing environment

and the reference viewing environment to form flare-adjusted colorimetric
values;
g) adjusting said flare-adjusted colorimetric values (52) in accordance with
the difference between the adaptive white point chromaticities specified

for the input viewing environment and the reference viewing environment
to form chromatic adapted colorimetric values; 
h) sensing said test colors (46) using an image-sensing means (14, 18, 23)
to form test color image signals; and
i) forming the transform (58) by relating said test color image signals to corresponding
chromatic-adapted colorimetric values.
The method according to claim 1 further comprising the step of:

k) applying said transform (58) to the image signals to form intermediate
database color values.
The method according to claim 1, further comprising the step of further
adjusting said flare-adjusted colorimetric values in accordance with the

difference in the surround specified for the input viewing environment
and the reference viewing environment.
A digital color image processing system of the type having means for
correcting an input image signal for lighting conditions) characterized by

a transform means (58) for transforming the input image signal to an intermediary
database color encoding representing the colorimetric values that

would be required to match, in the viewing conditions of a reference
viewing environment, the appearance of the input image as it would

appear if viewed in a specified input viewing environment.
