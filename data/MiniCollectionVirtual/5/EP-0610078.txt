<DESCRIPTION>
An antineoplastic depsipeptide from the Indian Ocean sea have 
Dolabellaauricularia is described in EP-A-399685. This invention is concerned with a cytotoxic and antiviral compound 
isolated from the sacoglossan, Elysia rafescens. According to the present invention there is provided, a new compound, the 
peptide, Kahalalide F, of the formula: 
The antitumor activities of this compound has been determinated "in 
vitro" in cell cultures of human lung carcinoma A-549 and human colon  
 
carcinoma HT-29. The procedure was carried out using the methodology 
descnbed by Raymond J. Bergeron et al. Biochem. Bioph. Res. Comm. 1984,121(3), 848-854 and by Alan C. Schroeder et al. J. Med, Chem. 1981, 24 1078-1083. The antiviral activities of this compound have also been determinated 
"in vitro" against HSV (Herpes simplex virus) and VSV (Vesicular stomatitis 
virus). The methodology used to carry out this determination is descnbed by 
Raymond J. Bergeron et al. Biochem. Bioph. Res. Comm. 1984, 121(3), 848-854 
and by Alan C. Schroeder et al. J. Med. Chem. 1981, 24 1078-1083. Therefore, the present invention also provides Kahalalide F of use in a method of treating any 
mammal affected by a malignant tumor sensitive to the compound, 
which comprises administering to the affected individual a 
therapeutically effective amount of the compound or a pharmaceutically 
composition thereof; and of use in a method of treating viral infections in mammals, 
comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment, an antiviral 
effective amount of the compound of the present invention. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations which 
contain as active ingredient the compound, or a pharmaceutical acceptable 
acid addition salt thereof, as well as the process for its preparation. Examples of pharmaceutical compositions include any solid (tablets, 
pills, capsules, granules, etc.) or liquid (solutions, suspensions or emulsions) 
suitable composition for oral, topical or parenteral administration, and they may 
contain the pure compound or in combination with any carrier or other 
pharmacologically active compounds. These compositions may need to be 
sterile when administered parenterally. The correct dosage of a pharmaceutical composition of the compound 
will vary according to the particular formulation, the mode of application and 
particular situs, host and tumor being treated. Other factors like age, body 
weight, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, condition of the 
host,
