<ABSTRACT>
Enamelled glass substrates which, on at least a part of one of their faces, include at least two superposed layers of enamel, the enamel layer in contact with the glass substrate including a vitreous matrix and reflecting particles whose refractive index differs from that of the vitreous matrix, these reflecting particles additionally having a melting temperature higher than that of the vitreous matrix. The enamelled glass substrates according to the invention are intended especially for the production of claddings of buildings.

Enamelled glass substrate, characterized in that it comprises, on at
least part of one of its faces, at least two superimposed enamelled layers,

the first enamel layer in contact with the glass substrate comprising a
vitreous matrix and reflecting particles, whose refractive index differs from

that of the vitreous matrix, said reflecting particles also having a higher
melting point than that of the vitreous matrix, and the second enamel layer

not comprising reflecting particles or comprising such reflecting particles
in a proportion equal to or lower than that of the reflecting particles

within the first enamel layer.
Enamelled glass substrate according to claim 1, characterized in that the
glass substrate is a flat glazing comprising at least one glass sheet.
Enamelled glass substrate according to claim 2, characterized in that the
glazing contains at least one tempered glass sheet.
Enamelled glass substrate according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the reflecting particles are particles formed or

covered by at least one metal such as aluminium, chromium, nickel, zirconium,
palladium, cadmium, copper and/or formed or covered by at least one metal

oxide such as titanium dioxide.
Enamelled glass substrate according to claim 4, characterized in that the
reflecting particles are mica particles covered by at least one metal and/or

at least one metal oxide.
Enamelled glass substrate according to one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the reflecting particles have a grain size between 10

and 200 µm.
Enamelled glass substrate according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the level of reflecting particles in the enamel layer

in contact with the glass substrate exceeds 3 vol.% and preferably exceeds 10
vol.%.
Enamelled glass substrate according to one of the claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the level of reflecting particles in the enamel layer

in contact with the glass substrate is below 80 vol.% and preferably below 70
vol.%.
Enamelled glass substrate according to one of the claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the vitreous matrix of the enamel layer in contact with

the glass substrate is transparent or translucent and preferably has a light 
transmission factor of at least 50%.
Enamelled glass substrate according to one of the claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the diffuse reflection level of said enamelled

substrate exceeds by at least 50% the diffuse reflection level of a
conventional enamel for a given wavelength in the visible range.
Enamelled glass substrate according to one of the claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that the thickness of the enamel layer in contact with the

glass substrate is between 30 and 100 µm and that of the enamel layer further
removed from the glass substrate is between 30 and 200 µm.
Process for the production of the enamelled substrate according to one of
the claims 1 to 11, characterized in that the first enamel layer containing

the reflecting particles is deposited on the glass substrate by screen
printing, spray coating or curtain coating and then the second enamel layer

is deposited on the first, before drying and high temperature heat treatment
for the vitrification of the enamels.
Process for the production of the enamelled substrate according to one of
the claims 1 to 11, characterized in that the two layers are deposited wet on

wet.
