<ABSTRACT>
A hair processing apparatus (10) has facing members (11a, 
11b) for nipping hair. The facing members have uneven 

surface portions (12a, 12b) on their contact surfaces which 
are engaged with each other. The uneven surface portions 

have a plurality of grooves along their length directions. 
The hair is placed along the grooves between the facing 

members, and pressed by making the facing members closer. 
Simultaneously, the facing members are kept at a high 

temperature to heat the hair.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hair processing methods and apparatus 
for wave perm or the like, and more particularly to a method and 
apparatus which are based on the fact that essential 
characteristics of hair are changed by applying a certain 
pressure or certain pressure and heat to the hair, and which 
enables easily to perm shrank or curled hair into straight hair, 
perm straight hair into waved hair, or make fine split hair back 
to the original state, and also enables to retain processed 
states of straight, waved or treated hair for a long time. Human's hair is formed of a certain kind of protein which called 
keratin like skin and nail are. When analyzed in detail, a hair is composed of a medullar ( core) 
as its center, cortices which surround the medullar ( the 
cortices are formed of longitudinally arranged spindle or cigar 
like shaped outer layer cells filled with keratin fibers), 
matrices which connects the cortex ( outer layer ) to each other 
( the matrices is called padding material and has high water 
absorption and moisture retention properties), and cuticles 
(outer layer of the hair ) which surround the hair. Therefore, to keep hair healthy for a long time, it is 
recommended to take good protein for forming keratin much enough 
at each meal( by having a lot of meat, beans or the like ). However, since hair is exposed to open air and sun light, and  
 
receives substances floating in the air, having good protein as 
explained before does not results in ideal health of the hair. 
It is further recommended to make efforts to carry out hair 
health care by diligent shampoo and treatment of the hair. Human has not been satisfied with only natural hair health 
maintenance, and her/his aesthetic sense has been actually 
satisfied with artificial processing of hair such as straight 
perm, wave perm and hair treatment. In a conventional processing of straight perm or wave perm, hair 
is washed and kept clean, and, a softening process ( a first 
liquid process) is performed by applying or coating softening 
material such as a cold liquid onto the whole hair. Then, the 
whole hair is divided into some bundles, and, for each bundle, 
a heating process, combing process, deposition of creamy 
material, or rolling by a rod is performed ( for wave perm). 
Next, a hardening process ( a second liquid process) is performed 
by applying or coating hardening material such as a cold liquid. 
After a certain time period, if necessary, rods are removed, and 
the hair is processed with hot water rinse to

<CLAIMS>
A hair processing method for wave perm or the like comprising 
steps of: 

dividing whole hair into a plurality of bundles; and, 
pressing each of said bundle of said hair at a predetermined 

pressure by a pressing means, said pressing means being formed 
in a shape of a wave or the like. 
A hair processing method for wave perm or the like 
according to claim 1, further comprising the steps of: 

performing a softening process by applying or infiltrating 
softening material to whole hair, before dividing said whole 

hair into a plurality of bundles; and 
after pressing each of said bundle of said hair, performing 

a hardening process by applying or infiltrating hardening 
material to said whole hair; and, 

performing hot water rinse. 
A hair processing method for wave perm or the like comprising 
a step of heating hair at the same time as said hair is pressed 

by a pressing means. 
A hair processing apparatus for wave perm or the like 
comprising a pressing means having facing members for nipping 

hair, said facing members having on respective contact faces 
respective uneven surface portions which are engaged with each 

other, said uneven surface portions having a plurality of grooves 
along length directions of said uneven surfaces portions, said 

contact faces being designed to hold said hair along said grooves 
and to produce pressure to said hair when said contact faces are 

made closer. 
A hair processing apparatus for wave perm or the like 
according to claim 4, wherein one of said facing members is 

designed to move to another of said facing members to make said 
contact faces of said facing members closer to produce pressure 

to said hair. 
A hair processing apparatus for wave perm or the like 
according to claim 4 or 5, said 

contact faces being designed to hold along said grooves said hair 
covered with shape retention members and to produce pressure to 

said hair covered with said shape retention members when said 
contact faces are made closer. 
A hair processing apparatus for wave perm or the like 
according to claim 6, wherein said shape retention members which 

cover said hair, are formed in almost the same shape as said 
uneven surface portions formed on said contact faces of said 

pressing means, said shape retention members having, on at least 
surfaces where said hair makes contact, a plurality of grooves 

along length directions of said shape retention members to hold 

said hair regularly. 
A hair processing apparatus for wave or the like according 
to claim 6 or 7, wherein said pressing means has facing members for 

nipping hair, said facing members having on respective contact 
faces respective uneven surface portions which are engaged with 

each other, said uneven surface portions having a plurality of 
grooves along length directions of said uneven surfaces portions, 

said contact faces being designed to hold said hair along said 
grooves and to produce pressure to said hair when said contact 

faces are made closer.
