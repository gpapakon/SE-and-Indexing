<ABSTRACT>
A flat top closure of a thermoplastic coated container 
and blank includes side edge panels 40 and 42, a front edge 

panel 46 foldable back onto itself and having an arcuate-shaped 
perforated line 70 formed thereon, and a cover panel 

44 having cover edge panels 72 and 74 connected to the sides 
thereof. The perforated line 70 breaks upon the cover 

panel 44 being opened to form a horizontal, arcuate-shaped 
pouring edge. The cover edge panels 72 and 74 are secured 

to the side edge panels 40 and 42 effectively to control 
film delamination upon the cover panel 44 being opened. A 

side seam 26 is at a front corner of the container. 
Triangular segments 51 and 53, a side seam extension panel 

extension 92, and front panel extensions 94 and 96 have cut 
and thus uncoated edges 51', 53', 92', 94' and 96' which, in 

the closed condition, occupy positions stepped relative to 

each other. Widenings 84 to 90 of the cover edge panels 72 
and 74 and the side edge panels 40 and 42 are sealed 

together inwards of the inner ends of the edges 51', 53', 
92', 94' and 96'.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to containers and, 
more particularly, to a blank and a container including an 
end closure of an improved construction. Containers for beverages such as milk, cream, other 
dairy products, juices, and the like, are conventionally 
constructed from thermoplastics-coated paperboard. 
Typically, these containers include a top end closure with a 
folded roof structure adapted to providing a readily 
available pouring spout when the contents of the container 
are to be dispensed. Coated paperboard blanks for constructing such a 
container are made on converting machines similar to those 
disclosed by US-A-2,672,208 and 3,731,600. After 
construction, the blanks are processed by forming, filling 
and sealing machines, such as those disclosed by US-A-3,303,761; 
3,918,236; 3,398,659; or 4,193,833, to produce 
the formed, filled and sealed containers of the type 
referred to above and shown and described in US-A- 3,270,940 
or 4,422,570. Other flat top container arrangements, which do not 
include a pouring spout as in US-A-3,270,940 and 4,422,570, 
are disclosed in US-A-4,397,415; 4,702,407, and 4,784,272. 
These three Patents disclose cartons which are adapted to 
hold frozen juices or "spoonable" products, and to have 
their top closures fully opened to provide access to the 
contents. The structure disclosed in US-A-4,784,272 is formed to 
include perforations along the score line between the front 
panel and the adjacent flat top panel. The structure 
disclosed in US-A-4,702,407 is formed to include 
perforations on the front panel adjacent the top end portion 
thereof, and along the fold lines between the side panels 
and the respective side edge panels. US-A-4,397,415 discloses a perforated line or partial 
cut formed horizontally across the fold line between a front  
 
fold-in panel segment and a fold-out segment. Accordingly, 
when the top is opened by breaking the perforated line or 
partial cut, and lifting the cover panel, a horizontal front 
edge panel remains, as well as a pair of oppositely disposed 
side fold-in edge panels, each bearing paper tear surfaces. US-A-2,758,775 discloses a flat top container wherein 
perforations are formed along the length of the cover panel 
adjacent the side edges thereof for co-operation with side 
edge panels connected to fold-in side panels of the 
container. US-A-2,819,832 discloses a flat top container having 
edge panels formed on the sides of an outer cover panel, and 
which are cut apart from side edge panels connected to
