<ABSTRACT>
In refrigerated vehicles and storage rooms it is necessary that the temperature be maintained within relatively narrow limits. Correspondingly, the temperature sensors used must be monitored for their correct functioning. This monitoring must be possible at any time and at any desired temperature by means of remote interrogation of the relevant temperature sensor, the plausibility of the controlling of the functioning in the present case being determined in such a manner that the component cost and the temperature dependence of the arrangement for controlling the functioning are low. In detail, semiconductor switches (22, 28) are provided in series with a measuring element (14) and a test resistor (27) arranged in parallel, the semiconductors being capable of being switched over externally via a control lead (21). Controlling the functioning of the temperature sensor (1) is carried out in this case by measuring only one frequency determined by the test resistor (27).
