<ABSTRACT>
An automatic winder wherein a yarn (Y) is taken up 
from a yarn supply bobbin (24) onto a package (25) and a 

defect of the yarn (Y) is detected and then the yarn (Y) is 
cut and jointed comprises taking up stopping means for 

stopping taking up when the number of times of detection of a 
defect becomes higher than a fixed number for a fixed length, 

and taking up re-starting means for releasing and abandoning 
the yarn (Y) of the yarn supply bobbin (24) for a 

predetermined time after such stopping, joining the remaining 
yarn (Y) on the yarn supply bobbin (24) and re-starting 

taking up.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic winder 
which winds up a yarn of a fixed length on a take-up 
package while keeping the quality, and particularly 
to an automatic winder which can restore itself without 
manual operation even when a defect of a yarn occurs 
frequently. An automatic winder (DE-A-3 80 61 65) is an apparatus which 
is constituted from a large number of take-up units 
each of which takes up a yarn of a yarn supply bobbin 
supplied thereto from a spinning frame onto a package 
joining the yarn so that the yarn on the take-up package 
may have a predetermined length. If the yarn supply 
bobbin becomes empty, then it is automatically replaced 
with a new yarn supply bobbin, and a yarn supplied from 
the new yarn supply bobbin can be connected to the yarn 
already taken up on the take-up package to continue 
taking up. Meanwhile, when the yarn is broken during 
taking up, or when a defect of the yarn is detected 
and the yarn is cut, the thus broken yarn or a yarn 
of a succeeding conforming article is connected to the 
yarn on the take-up package side to continue taking up. Detection and cutting of a defect of a yarn 
are performed by a slub catcher. The slub catcher is 
located on a passage of the yarn and always checks the  
 
thickness of the yarn. When abnormality in thickness 
that the yarn is thicker or thinner than a certain ratio 
compared with the original thickness or abnormality 
that some variation in thickness continues over a 
predetermined length is detected, the yarn is cut 
compulsorily. After such compulsory cutting of the yarn 
joining of the yarn is performed by means of a yarn 
joining apparatus. Since the opposite ends of the yarn 
thus cut are lost by some lengths upon joining of the 
yarn, the defective portion is roughly removed at the 
front and the rear of the defective portion. Then, 
taking up is continued. A take-up package can be put 
into a condition free from any defective portion in 
this manner. The series of operations of the detecting 
operation of a defect, the cutting operation and the 
yarn joining operation described above is called yarn 
joining cycle. When such yarn joining cycle occurs 
singly, it is possible to remove the defective portion 
and continue taking up as described above. However, 
when such yarn joining cycle occurs frequently, it is 
considered that the yarn supply bobbin or some other 
element has some trouble, and accordingly, processing 
of an operator is waited for without continuing taking 
up. In particular, when the number

<CLAIMS>
A method of taking up a yarn from a yarn supply bobbin 
(24) onto a package (25) and detecting (28, 10, 4) a defect 

of the yarn and cutting, joining (29) and taking up the 
yarn, when the number of times of detection of a defect 

within a predetermined amount of the yarn (Y) by such 
detection exceeds a present number of times taking up is 

stopped
 
characterized in that
 
that after taking up stopped the yarn of the yarn supply 

bobbin (24) is removed and abandoned over a certain length, 
and the
n the yarn on the yarn supply bobbin side and the 
yarn on the take-up package side are joined with each other 

and taking up is re-started.  
 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
detection of a defect is performed by means of a slub catcher (28) 

provided on a yarn passage, and cutting of the yarn is 
performed compulsorily when a defect is detected. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
detection of a defect is based on the number of yarn break 

times. 
A method as claimed in one claims 1 to 3, wherein 
taking up is stopped when the number of times of detection of 

a defect reaches a number of times set for a unit length of 
the yarn.  

 
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein taking up is stopped when the number of times of 

detection of a defect reaches a number of times set for a 
unit time. 
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein removal of the yarn of the yarn supply bobbin is 

performed by a yarn sucking section (T) provided on a yarn 
passage. 
A method as claimed in claim 6, wherein removal of 
the yarn by said yarn sucking section is perfomed 

intermittently. 
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein, when a yarn break occurs within a predetermined time 

after taking up is re-started, taking up is stopped and an 
alarm is developed.  

 
An automatic winder, comprising take-up means (21) for 
taking up a yarn (Y) from a yarn supply bobbin (24) onto a 

package (25), defect detecting means (28, 10, 4) for 
detecting and cutting a defect of the yarn (Y), yarn joining 

means (29) for joining the yarn (Y), controlling means form 
controlling the operation of said take-up means (21) and 

said yarn joining means (29), and yarn removing means (T) 
for removing a certain length of the yarn (Y) from the yarn 

supply bobbin (24), wherein controlling the operation of the 
take-up means (21), said yarn joining means (29) and that 

yarn removing means (T) is performed by said 
controlling means in response to a result of detection by 

said detecting means (28, 10, 4), and wherein said 
controlling means controls so that, when the number of times 

of detection of a defect within a predetermined amount of 
the yarn (Y) by said detecting means (28, 10, 4) exceeds a 

preset number of times, said take-up means (21) stops its 
operation and then said removing means (T) removes the yarn 

(Y) of the yarn supply bobbin (24) for a predetermined time, 
whereafter the yarns (Y) of the yarn supply bobbin (24) and 

the take-up package (25) are joined with each other by said 
yarn joining means (29) and then operation of said take-up 

means (21) is re-started.

said removing means (T) for the yarn (Y) of the yarn supply 

bobbin (24) is yarn sucking means (5) provided on a yarn 
passage.
