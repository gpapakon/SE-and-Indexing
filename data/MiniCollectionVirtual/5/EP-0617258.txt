<ABSTRACT>
The goniometer, of the type comprising an arm (1) capable of bearing on a reference plane and a mobile arm (2) capable of moving with respect to the first arm through an angle lying between 0 and 360@, is equipped with at least one visible laser beam emitter (4) which allows the beam to be projected along a direction parallel to the axis of the arm which is fitted with the said emitter, in the direction of points which are inaccessible to the user, thus making it possible to measure the angle defined between the laser beam and the reference plane.
