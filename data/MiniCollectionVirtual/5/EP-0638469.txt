<ABSTRACT>
A virtual block system is provided in which a 
section of track is represented by a zone having a 

plurality of virtual track circuits. Communication 
between wayside and the vehicle is established within the 

zone, and may be used to provide the initial position of 
the vehicle to the carborne equipment. The carborne 

equipment can then calculate and up-date its position 
within the zone by using its initial position and sensor 

information relative to its movement within the zone. 
The actual position within the zone can be transmitted 

from the vehicle to the wayside equipment. The wayside 
equipment converts the actual position within the zone to 

a virtual track circuit occupancy. The wayside equipment 
may also use the train length to calculate one or more 

virtual blocks as being occupied. The wayside unit 
outputs the occupancy status, occupied or unoccupied, to 

the wayside interlocking equipment. The wayside 
equipment generates profile data which can be transmitted 

to the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
Railway signal control systems typically use the 
track circuit block as the basic element of train 
location, and communication and control. Electrical 
signals applied to the length of track comprising a block 
is shunted by the rail vehicle axle and the change in 
signal is detected and is used to indicate a track block 
that this occupied. In addition, such track circuits 
also can be used to detect for broken rail, and establish 
communication from wayside equipment to moving rail 
vehicles, cab signals. Because of the operating 
requirements associated with track block signals the 
equipment used in each track circuit must provide for a 
vital operation of that track circuit. While block 
signals give reliable indication of the vehicle position, 
the limiting factor is the length of a given block. When 
a vehicle crosses two adjacent 1,000 foot block sections, 
the signal apparatus will detect the vehicle within a 
2,000 foot length of track. Because train operation 
depends upon the conditions in front of and behind moving 
vehicles such 2,000 foot vehicle indication may effect 
operation in over a mile of track. When it is desirable 
to operate a high frequency of trains (short headways)  
 
such as in rush hour mass transit systems, the safe 
headway between trains must be maintained at a minimum 
distance so as to permit a high operating frequency of 
service. One of the ways this can be achieved is by 
increasing the number of individual track circuits and 
decreasing the length of each track circuit. However, to 
obtain shortened track blocks requires a proportionally 
higher number of track circuit equipments and can become 
cost prohibitive. Since many trains are operated either 
automatically or manually based upon the train conditions 
received through cab signal equipment, the train 
information available to cab signal is uniform within the 
block and cannot take into account information or 
conditions such as grade that may exist within a portion 
of a block. Track conditions which are appropriate for 
the train at the entering section of a block may be non-optimum 
for uphill sections in the exiting end of a 
block. Presently the information would default to the 
reduced condition which would be unnecessary in uphill 
grade areas. Such default does not result in optimum 
train operation. This disadvantage can be overcome by 
using a larger number of discrete track circuits. If the 
track circuits comprise 100 foot blocks, the headways can 
be significantly increased over that of the
