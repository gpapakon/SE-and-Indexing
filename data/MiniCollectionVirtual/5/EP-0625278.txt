<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to devices and methods for perceiving
quantitative and qualitative information. This invention relates more specifically
to audible methods and techniques for perceiving information provided by
instrumentation used in the nondestructive evaluation of materials.Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies such as ultrasonics, acoustic
emission, electromagnetics, radiography, and others, all generally rely on some form
of visual presentation of the inspection information to allow for the human
interpretation of the data. It is usually up to the test operator to rapidly view and
translate the graphic information presented to him in order to acquire an
understanding of the physical characteristics of the material under test and to
properly control the progression of the analysis.One of the most common NDE technologies is the utilization of ultrasonic
signals for the detection of cracks and other irregularities in materials. The
information provided by ultrasonic NDE methods is typically in the form of a visual
display on a cathode ray tube or on a computer video display screen. The operator
of such a system must interpret the visual displays of frequencies, amplitudes, and
time in a manner that allows him to locate, and to some extent describe, the
characteristics of the cracks or other irregularities found within the material under
test.In ultrasonic NDE, the material being tested may be scanned by a test
operator with transducers that receive and/or transmit an ultrasonic signal. The
receivers may be coincidentally located with the transmitter or may be separate
elements on the same or an adjacent surface. The operator, therefore, must correlate
what he sees on a display with the location of the transducers at any particular
instant, and with the expected propagation paths of the signal in the material.
Subtle variations in the display and the rapidity with which the display changes
often prevent the operator/technician from visually interpreting all of the
information being provided.Ultrasonic evaluation is one of the more frequently utilized NDE
technologies, and is representative of the NDE technologies to which the present 
invention may apply. Ultrasonic methods are widely used to detect and determine
the depth or size of cracks and other flaws within otherwise homogenous materials.
One ultrasonic crack sizing method, called the Tip Diffraction method, relies on the
detection of two time separated signals. A schematic diagram of a typical
application of the Tip
