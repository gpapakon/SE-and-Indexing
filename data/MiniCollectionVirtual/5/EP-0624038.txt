<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a TV telephone system that comprises a 
TV telephone apparatus (100), which includes image 

pickup means (102), display means (103) and an 
input/output port (50) to connect to another apparatus, 

and a station (150), which includes a modulation/demodulation 
section (14) to connect to a telephone line 

and an input/output port (52) to connect to the TV telephone 
apparatus (100), whereby when the TV telephone 

apparatus (100) is connected to the station (150), an 
image is exchanged therebetween over a telephone line 

using the image pickup means (102) and display means 
(103) of the TV telephone apparatus (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image data transmission system as set forth in
the preamble of claim 1. A system of this kind is known from EP-A- 0 500 091.The aforementioned document discloses a television telephone including a
moveable head section, a support section and a bottom section. The moveable
head section includes an imaging device for inputting images and a display for
displaying images. The bottom section includes a communication controller for
transmission and reception of encoded information of at least one of audio and
visual signals to and from a communication network, and a telephone controller for
controlling transmission and reception functions and including a key console unit.
The support section serves for connecting the bottom section and the moveable
head section and for supporting the moveable head section and includes an
image encoder/decoder for encoding image input signals and for decoding
received image signals. In an embodiment of the television telephone, the
moveable head section and its support section may be mechanically and
electrically detached from the bottom section.TV telephone apparatuses are classified by types of communication networks to
be linked and the types of image and voice transmission functions. For example,
some TV telephone apparatuses are connected to an analogue public telephone
line to transmit a monochromatic still 
picture or a color still picture, or to transmit a
color dynamic image. The still-picture TV telephone
apparatus, which is connected to an analog public
telephone line to send a monochromatic still picture,
employs a system for directly transmitting image data
without compression. For monochromatic image data of
64 gray scales (6 bits) with one screen consisting
of 100 × 160 pixels, for example, data of about
100 × 160 × 6 = 96000 bits (about 11.7 Kbytes) has
been transmitted at a transfer rate of about 8740 bps
(bit per second). This takes about 11 seconds to send
one screen of image data.Image data carries a large amount of information so
that direct processing of image data is not practical in
view of memory capacity, communication speed and so
forth. As a solution, there has been proposed a color
dynamic-image TV telephone apparatus which compresses
image data and voice data to about 1/20 to 1/100 before
transmission to thereby ensure transmission and reception
of a dynamic image at a rate of two to ten frames
per second using an analog telephone band.As the compressed transmission of image data will
transfer a considerable
