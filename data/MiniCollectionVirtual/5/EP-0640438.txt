<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for grinding a workpiece (1) while 
electrolytically dressing an electrically conductive 

grinding wheel (2). The apparatus has an electrically 
conductive grinding wheel (2) with a contact surface for 

contacting the workpiece (1), an electrode (3) opposed to the 
grinding wheel (2) and spaced a distance therefrom, a 

nozzle (4) for supplying conductive fluid between the 
grinding wheel (2) and the electrode (3), and a device (5) for 

applying a voltage between said grinding wheel (2) and 
said electrode (3). An eddy current sensor (10) is arranged in 

proximity to the working surface of the grinding wheel 
(2) for measuring the position of the grinding wheel (2) in a 

non-contact manner. A grinding wheel controlling 
device is provided for controlling the position of the 

grinding wheel (2) based on the values measured by the 
eddy current sensor (10). The apparatus can measure the 

dimensions of the grinding wheel (2) during its grinding 
operation without being influenced by the grinding 

fluid and the nonconductive film formed on the wheel 
(2) and can therefore efficiently carry out high accuracy 

grinding without a high degree of operator skill.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method and an apparatus as per the preamble of claims 1 and 6. An example of such
an apparatus and method is disclosed in EP-A-192773.
From
EP-A-192773, there is known a cutting and grinding method using a conductive grinding
wheel wherein a dressing operation is carried out simultaneously during a grinding
operation. Said dressing operation is carried out by applying a voltage between a dresser
electrode and a conductive grinding wheel while applying a grinding fluid from a nozzle.
During the initial stages of grinding with electrolytic dressing, a non-conductive film
comprising iron oxide (Fa2O3) is formed on the surface of the grinding wheel so that the
electric resistance of the wheel is then increased. Said non-conductive film formed on the
grinding wheel surface renders it difficult to exactly measure the dimensions of the grinding
wheel and accordingly, the resultant change in the grinding wheel dimensions with time
requires much operator skill in grinding the workpiece to accurate dimensions and shapes.Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication
No. 188266/1989 (Japanese Patent Application
No. 12305/1988) filed by the same applicant as that of
the present application discloses a method and an
apparatus for electrolytically dressing a conductive
grinding wheel. The conductive grinding wheel may be
a metal bonded grinding wheel, for example, a cast
iron fiber bonded diamond wheel, and the wheel is
dressed by applying a voltage to the grinding wheel.
This method and apparatus have been successfully
applied to the mirror surface grinding of
semiconductor material such as silicon wafers. In
addition, the inventor of the present invention has
developed a technique called "ELID grinding"
(Electrolytic In-process Dressing) which was reported
at a symposium held by The Institute of Physical and 
Chemical Research (RIKEN) of Saitama-ken, Japan
("Recent trends in mirror surface grinding
technology", May 5, 1991).In the ELID grinding method, a workpiece is
ground by applying a voltage between a conductive
grinding wheel and an electrode while supplying
conductive fluid between the wheel and the electrode.
The wheel is then electrolytically dressed. The ELID
apparatus comprises a conductive grinding wheel having
a contact surface for contacting the workpiece, an
electrode opposed to the grinding wheel and spaced a
distance therefrom, a nozzle for supplying conductive
fluid between the grinding wheel and the electrode,
and a device (i.e., a power source and feeder) for
applying a
