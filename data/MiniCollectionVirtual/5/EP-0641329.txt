 COMPOUNDS HAVING ANGIOTENSINE II ANTAGONISTIC ACTIVITYThe present invention refers to heterocyclic com¬ pounds having angiotensine II antagonistic activity.The renin-angiotensine system (RAS) is a proteoly- tic cascade playing a fundamental role in regulating blood pressure and is apparently involved in the onset and maintenance of some cardiovascular pathologies, such as hypertension or heart failure.The octapeptide hormone angiotensine II (All) fi¬ nal product of RAS, is mainly formed in blood by the degradation of angiotensine I by the ACE enzyme which is localized in the endothelium of blood vessels, lungs, kidneys and many other organs. This hormone exerts on the arteries a powerful vasoconstrictive ac¬ tion as a consequence of its interaction with specific receptors, present on the cell membranes.One of the possible control modes of RAS is the All antagonism at the receptorial level. Some peptide analogues of All (e.g. saralasine, sarmesine) are known to antagonize competitively the interactions of the hormone, but their clinical or experimental use has been limited by a partial agonist activity and by the lack of oral activity.Recently, several non-peptide 5- or 6-membered he¬ terocyclic compounds were disclosed as All receptor an- tagonists. Example of these compounds are claimed in EP 253310, EP 323841, EP 324377, EP 409332, EP 411507, EP 412594 A, EP 419048 A. The present invention refers to heterocyclic derivatives having All antagonist proper¬ ties which may be therefore used for the treatment of 

 different cardiovascular pathologies such as hyperten¬ sion, heart failure and intraocular hypertension. The compounds of the invention have the general formula Iwherein: 
R is 

 linear or branched alkyl;R, is hydrogen; Cj^ linear or branched alkyl; aryl or arylalkyl wherein aryl is phenyl, naphthyl, 2-thienyl, 2-furanyl optionally substituted by one or more halogens, C^_4 alkyl, C1-4 alkoxy, hydroxy, carboxy or c^_ linear or branched alkoxycarbonyl groups; when N and X are connected by a double bond, R. is obviously not present;R2 is hydrogen, C^_4 linear or branched alkyl, hydroxy, amino, aryl, wherein aryl is as defined above, or a group of formula NHA wherein A is C2-C7 acyl, CN, NO,, CONHB or CSNHB wherein B is hydrogen, C,_c4 linear or branched alkyl", Cg_7 cycloalkyl, aryl as defined above; 3 is hydrogen or one o more halogen atoms; X is CO or a C-R4 group wherein R4 may be OR^ (wherein R^ must be obviously present and has the above mentio¬ ned meanings) , aryl optionally substituted by
