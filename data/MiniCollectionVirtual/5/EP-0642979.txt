<ABSTRACT>
The bottle-like plastic container (1) consists of two container parts (3, 4) which are welded together and have been produced by thermoforming of a plastic film so as to use little material. The weld extends in an easily producible manner along the peripheral edges of the two container parts (3, 4), said edges extending in one plane and projecting in a flange-like manner. Owing to their stackability, the thermoformed container parts (3, 4) can be transported to a filling plant in a space-saving manner and can easily be joined together there. In this case, the filling can also take place into a shell-shaped container part (3) which is still open and comprises virtually the entire container contents, thus allowing high filling speeds. A likewise thermoformed base part (7) which is engaged below the bottom wall (12) can guarantee the stability of the thin-walled plastic container.
