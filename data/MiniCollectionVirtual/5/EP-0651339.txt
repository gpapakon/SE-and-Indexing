<ABSTRACT>
Tabular documents have column structures (32; Fig.4) that can be determined 
without decoding the bitmap. The method searches (102) for separation intervals 

(I₁-I₅; Fig.4) 
that separate word fragments (30; Fig.4) in the table. These separation intervals are processed 

by intersecting (116) them with other intervals and ranking (120) the resulting intervals. A 
structured closure of separation intervals (I₁-I₅) are maintained in bins. The intervals in the bins 

are sorted and used to determine new intersections when the next separation interval is 
processed. The intervals with the highest ranking are selected (122) as the column separation 

intervals. The columns are easily identified with the method without first decoding the 
bitmap.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in finding the
columns in a tabular document. More particularly, this
invention searches for column separations and only
processes the line-intervals separating the word fragments
in the table.A tabular document is a systematic arrangement of
logically related entities that are mapped onto a layout
structure based on simple linear constraints. By
controlling the placement and format of each entity, these
constraints provide the visual cues that help to identify
the organization of a table content, i.e., its logical
structure. The primary geometrical constraint imposed on
a table is a linear placement of related entries. Other
constraints include alignment and use of monospaced fonts
in typesetting the table.In documents containing a large number of similar
records, entities of the same logical identity are
typically placed along columns of a grid structure. To
determine the locations of the columns, a conventional
technique histograms the bitmap and searches the histogram
for peaks. This method requires processing the characters
and other artifacts into a bitmap.The invention recognizes that the column structure of
these types of documents can be determined without decoding
the bitmap.The present invention provides a method of locating
columns in a tabular document characterized in that the
method comprises the steps of:
a) extracting intervals located between image
fragments;b) determining intervals representing the intersection
between extracted intervals or between extracted intervals
and intervals resulting from a previously determined
intersection; and, c) locating columns in the tabular document by
determining the more frequently occurring of the extracted
intervals and the intervals determined in step (b).Preferably, the intersection intervals and the space
intervals are stored in a bin structure. Preferably, a
duplicate interval is eliminated from the bin structure and
the rank of the duplicate interval remaining is increased
by one. Preferably the ranking of intervals in the bin
structure depend on how often an intersection between a
specific interval and an interval in the bin structure
results in a duplicate interval. The highest ranking bin
intervals may represent the location of the space between
columns in the tubular document.The intersection intervals can have a zero width
representing two adjacent columns without a space interval.The invention further provides a method of locating
columns in a tabular document, according to claim 4 of the
appended

<CLAIMS>
A computerized method of locating columns in a tabular document image
characterized in that the method comprises the steps of:


a) extracting intervals (I) located along the x-axis between adjacent image
fragments (30) of said tabular document image;
b) determining any intervals (g) representing the
intersection between extracted intervals (I) or between

extracted intervals (I) and intervals resulting from a
previously determined intersection; and,
c) locating columns in the tabular document by
determining as column separation intervals the more frequently occurring of the extracted

intervals (I) and the intervals (g) determined in step (b).
The method of claim 1, wherein the extracted intervals
are a white space between two adjacent image fragments.
The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein skewed
columns in the tabular document are processed by first

deskewing the image fragments.
A computerized method of locating columns in a tabular document image
characterized in that the method comprises the steps of:


a) extracting a current interval (I) located along the x-axis between adjacent
image fragments (30) of said tabular document image;
b) determining any intersections between the current
interval (I) and any intervals (g) previously stored within

a bin structure (42);
c) storing data representing the current interval and
interval(s) corresponding to any determined intersections

in a bin structure (42); 
d) repeating steps (a) to (c) until all of the
intervals are extrac
ted from the tabular document; and,
e) locating columns in the tabular document by
determining as column separation intervals the more frequently occurring of the intervals

(g) represented by the stored data.

image fragments are one of connected letters, numbers,

symbols, pictures and graphics.

(a) is performed without decoding characters of, or a

bitmap of, the tabular document image.

occurring intervals; and
c) output means (14,16) for outputting the locations
of columns in the tabular document corresponding to the

locations of the more frequently occurring intervals.
