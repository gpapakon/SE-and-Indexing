detecting means (26,27,28) for detecting steering angles of the left and 
right load wheels (12L,12R) and the drive wheel (11). Each of the left 

and right straddle arms (10L,10R) comprises: a bracket (13) which 
rotatably supports a steering shaft (16), the center of the steering 

shaft (16) being positioned at an outer position in the width direction 
of the forklift body (2), the bracket (13) being fixed to a lower face 

of the steering shaft (16), supporting the load wheels (12L,12R) at an 
outer position of the forklift body (2), and rotatably supporting the 

center of the load wheel in the width direction of the load wheel, the 
center of the load wheel (12) being separated from the center of the 

steering shaft (16) by a predetermined distance (S); a gear (20) which 
is fixed to the bracket (13) and formed into a sector shape, the arc 

portion of the sector gear (20) being directed to the center of the 
forklift (1); and a driving gear (19) which engages with the sector gear 

(20) and is driven by the driving means (29-35,25,18,17), the driving

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reach forklift 
according to the preamble part of claim 1, 
and more 
particularly to a reach forklift which has steerable load 
wheels and is mainly intended to attain an improvement in the 
efficiency of cargo work. Examined patent publications JP-B-5815342, 5815343, 5815344 and unexamined 
patent publication JP-A-57121599 relate to 
a multi-directional vehicle as shown in 
Figs. 12 and 13. When the vehicle travels in the 
directions indicated by arrow A, caster wheels p and m are 
turned and then fixed in these directions so that they cannot 
make a turn, and a caster wheel n is allowed to turn, by 
hydraulically controlling cylinders provided for these wheels. 
In this state, a steered and driving wheel l is turned toward 
a desired direction, so that Ackerman steering can be effected. When the vehicle travels in the directions indicated by 
arrow B, the caster wheels p and n are turned and then fixed in 
these directions so that they cannot make a turn, and the 
caster wheel m is allowed to turn, by hydraulically controlling 
the cylinders. In this state, the steered and driving wheel l 
is turned toward a desired direction, so that Ackerman steering 
can be effected in the same manner as described above. In the above-described vehicle, however, the cylinders 
s1 and s2, link levers and the like are housed in straddle  
 
arms, so that the left and right straddle arms become larger in 
width. The large width of straddle arms is quite inconvenient 
because such a forklift is required to travel along very narrow 
pathways in a warehouse. When the travel direction is to be changed from A to B 
or vice versa, the vehicle a is first stopped, and then a 
button switch or the like is pressed. The necessity of 
individually performing such mode switching operations makes it 
impossible to continuously change the travel direction. When 
the vehicle is steered according to the theory of 
Ackerman-Jeantaud, the travel direction is limited to those 
indicated by A or B, and the attitude of the vehicle cannot be 
changed with respect to other directions (for example, 
directions inclined at 45 degrees away from the directions of 
arrow A). Furthermore, the steering of the vehicle cannot be 
controlled in such a manner that the turning center thereof is 
continuously changed and located on the approximate center of 
the body of the vehicle. Thus, the vehicle cannot make a small 
turn.  
 FR-2 201 66 relates to a forklift having two steerable wheels 
and a lead wheel, whose center axis
