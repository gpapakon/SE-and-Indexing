<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a driving apparatus
for a liquid crystal display utilizing an addressing technique
effective to permit a fast responding STN (Super Twisted
Nematic) simple matrix type liquid crystal display to provide
images of high contrast.The liquid crystal display is nowadays used as one
type of flat panel displays, an exemplary type of which is a
STN simple matrix type liquid crystal display. As shown in
Fig. 1, this STN simple matrix type liquid crystal display is
of a simple structure includes a plurality of transparent,
stripe-shaped first electrodes formed on a first glass substrate
so as to extend in one direction, a corresponding number
of similarly transparent, stripe-shaped second electrodes
formed on a second glass plate so as to extend in a transverse
direction perpendicular to such one direction to thereby form
a matrix of row and column electrodes together with the first
electrodes, and a layer of liquid crystal material sealingly
sandwiched between the first and second glass substrates. Due
to this peculiar structure, the STN liquid crystal display has
an advantage in that it is inexpensive to make. With the
advent of a STN liquid crystal display having a fast responding
characteristic and capable of displaying time-varying image of
a video-rate, the field of application of this STN liquid
crystal display is now expanding. However, It has been found that the fast responding
STN simple matrix type liquid crystal display is susceptible to
a considerable reduction in image contrast if it is driven by
the use of the conventional driving technique in which a select
voltage is applied at a time to one of the row electrodes during
one frame period while information to be applied to pixels
aligned with such one of the row electrodes is supplied through
the column electrodes. To avoid this considerable reduction in
image contrast, a new driving technique has been suggested to
improve the image contrast exhibited by the STN simple matrix
type liquid crystal display by selecting the plural row electrodes
simultaneously at a time and selecting a number of times
one of the row electrodes during one frame period.This recently suggested driving technique is shown in
will be discussed with reference to Fig. 2. A voltage proportional
to a data having a predetermined orthogonal matrix is
applied as a row signal to the row electrodes of the STN simple
matrix type liquid crystal display. The orthogonal matrix
referred to above consists of a data of two binary digits of
"1" and "-1" or a

A driving apparatus for a liquid crystal display (16) of a type sandwiching a
layer of liquid crystal material capable of responding to a voltage of an effective

value applied between row and column electrodes, which apparatus comprises:

an image data buffer memory (1) for storing and outputting a digital image
data of one frame, transferred from an external circuit, in the form of an image

data matrix;
a matrix generating means (200) for outputting data having a predetermined
orthogonal matrix;
a conversion means (100) for converting the image data with the use of the
orthogonal matrix into an converted data matrix and for outputting the converted

data matrix;
a converted data buffer memory (7) for storing and outputting the converted
data matrix; and
a row driving means (300; 13, 14, 15) for driving the liquid crystal display in
synchronism with a row signal, which applies the orthogonal matrix to the row

electrodes of the liquid crystal display, and a column driving means (400) which
applies the converted data matrix to the column electrodes of the liquid crystal

display (16);
wherein in case of interlaced image data inputted from the external circuit,
each of said image data buffer memory (1) and said converted data buffer memory

wherein said row driving means (300; 13, 14, 15) applies one signal of the row

signal to the neighboring two row electrodes of the liquid crystal display (16)
during an odd-numbered field period and, during an even-numbered field period, to

the neighboring two row electrodes which have been shifted by a value corresponding
to one row with respect to those during an odd-numbered field period.
The driving apparatus as claimed in claim 1,

wherein said conversion means (100) comprises a virtual row forming means (3)

squares of data on one column of the image data matrix which comprises discrete
values corresponding to real numbers of 1 to -1 and for adding the calculated value

one column of the image data are to be transferred from the image data buffer

memory (1) to the arithmetic means (150); and wherein said arithmetic means

orthogonal matrix conforming to a direction of the rows differs from a length of the

image data matrix conforming to a direction of the columns, to add to the image
data matrix rows in which data are zero, to thereby adjust the length of the

orthogonal matrix conforming to the direction of the rows to the length of the
image data matrix conforming to the direction of the columns.
