<ABSTRACT>
Radio equipment such as car telephones, service transceivers and the like are increasingly being installed in motor vehicles. Such equipment makes the user quite independent and more mobile. This advantage also necessarily entails a safety risk in that the concentration and reaction to the road traffic of a vehicle driver using such equipment deteriorate since, in most cases, he must hold a receiver in his hand for operating the transceiver and thus then only has one hand for steering the vehicle. This is remedied by so-called hands-free talking devices in which speaking is done via a permanently mounted microphone and listening is done via a loudspeaker. The invention describes a device which is of simple construction and enables a loudspeaker to be used which is already available in the motor vehicle for an audio device. The device is of very small construction and is installed so easily that, in particular, it is also suitable for subsequent installation in a motor vehicle. Due to the use of the installed loudspeaker, the quality of reproduction is very good.

<CLAIMS>
Device for switching-over a loudspeaker (4) in a motor
vehicle interior between an audio appliance (2) and a radio

appliance (3), the loudspeaker outputs (5) of the audio
appliance (2) being electronically muted if an input or

output signal is present at the radio appliance (3),
characterized in that a switch-over unit (1) is present

that, in the event of an input signal or output signal
being present at the radio appliance (3), switches the

loudspeaker (4) to the loudspeaker output (6) of the radio
appliance (3) and simultaneously disconnects it from the

loudspeaker output (5) of the audio appliance (2) and in
that a resistor (20) is always disposed between the

loudspeaker outputs (5.3, 6) of the audio appliance (2) or
radio appliance (3) and the switch-over unit (1) in such a

way that no clicking interference occurs during the switch-over
operation.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
switch-over unit (1) comprises an electronic circuit (7)

and an electro-mechanical change-over switch (8).
Device according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in
that the electromechanical change-over switch (8) is a

relay.
Device according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the electro-mechanical change-over switch (8) always

switches the connection between the loudspeaker (4) and the
radio appliance (3) if the audio appliance (2) is not in

operation.
Device according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the electromechanical change-over

switch (8) connects the loudspeaker output (5) of the audio
appliance (2) to the loudspeaker (4) if the audio appliance 

(2) is in operation and the radio appliance (3) is
inactive.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
loudspeaker (4) is the front loudspeaker on the driver's

side of a motor vehicle.
