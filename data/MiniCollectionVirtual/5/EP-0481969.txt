<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a shop rack comprising a 
plurality of shelves, on which goods can be displayed, and a 
frame supporting the shelves. Racks of this kind are well known and are frequently 
being used in self-service shops. The goods are mostly 
packaged in jars, bags, cartons and the like, and placed in 
rows one behind the other. This means that, for example, one 
or more rows of bags of crystal sugar are arranged 
transversely to the longitudinal direction of shelf. Next to 
the bags of sugar, for example, one or more rows of boxes of 
sugar lumps may be placed, etc. The shopping public can then 
take the foremost bag of sugar, or box or sugar lumps etc. and 
put it in a trolley. GB-A-2185457 discloses cold store provided with an 
apparatus for conveying packages of foodstuff through the cold 
store. The apparatus comprises several floors arranged one 
above the other, with each floor being defined by walking beam 
or pusher conveyors for conveying the packages in mutually 
spaced relationship. In a self-service shop, in order to ensure a well-arranged 
and ordered display of goods, it is the practice for 
the shop attendants regularly to push forward the rows of 
products, which rows have become shortened owing to the 
removal of the foremost products. The racks thus remain filled 
as much as possible at the front side facing the public and  
 
interspaces between products in a row are avoided. Pushing the 
products placed on a shelf of a shop rack forwardly in the 
manner described is called "trimming" Such trimming is a highly labour-intensive and often 
tiring work, in particular in the case of low-level shelves 
and in the case of high and/or relatively deep shelves. There is accordingly a need for a possibility of 
automating this work. It is an object of the present invention to meet this 
need. To this effect, according to the invention, a shop rack 
of the above kind is characterized by drive means for the 
conveyor means, said drive means being arranged to service 
simultaneously at least some superimposed shelves. It is noted that it has been tried in the past to achieve 
the effect contemplated by means of shelves inclined 
downwardly to the front. As soon as the foremost product of a 
row of products is removed, the remaining row of products 
slides forwardly by gravity. One disadvantage of that solution 
is that the shelves should be placed at rather a steep angle 
to ensure that the products of a row slide forwardly in the 
manner contemplated under all conditions. In the case

<CLAIMS>
A shop rack comprising a plurality of shelves (33-37) on which 
articles can be displayed, and a frame supporting said 

shelves (33-37), wherein a number of shelves are provided with conveyor 
means (3,4) capable of transporting articles placed on the shelf to 

the front of the shelf, and drive means (54,55) for the 
conveyor means (3,4), characterized by said drive means being arranged to service 

simultaneously at least some superimposed shelves (33-37). 
A shop rack as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the drive means comprise a plurality of pneumatic hoses (54) 

which expand when a pressure medium is pumped into them under 
pressure. 
A shop rack as claimed in claim 2, characterized in 
that the drive means comprise a plurality of movable uprights (50,51) 

carrying vertically movable parts (41) of a plurality of shelves 
arranged to be jointly moved up and down through power 

transmitting means by energizing one or more pneumatic hoses (54). 
A shop rack as claimed in claim 3, characterized in 
that the movable uprights (50,51) each stand on a lifting strip (52), which 

lifting strips (52), in turn, rest on a pneumatic hose (54) laid in a 
retaining section. 
A shop rack as claimed in claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the movable uprights (50,51) are arranged next to fixed 

uprights (31,32) and are connected to said fixed uprights (31,32) so as to be 
slidable upwardly and downwardly.  

 
A shop rack as claimed in any of claims 3-5, 
characterized in that the vertically movable parts (41) of the 

shelves are carried by the movable uprights (50,51) for reciprocating 
movement in the horizontal direction. 
A shop rack as claimed in claim 6, characterized in 
that at least some of at least the movable uprights (50,51) on one 

longitudinal side of the rack are hollow uprights housing a 
pneumatic hose (56) in operative association with the movable parts (41) 

of the shelves through power transmitting means. 
A shop rack as claimed in claim 7, characterized in 
that the pneumatic hose (56) hangs within the hollow uprights (51) 

between a wall member of the hollow uprights (51) and a pushing 
strip (55) arranged within the hollow uprights, and that, at the 

level of the shelves, openings are provided in the wall 
portion of the hollow uprights (51) opposite to the pushing strip (55), 

through which projections of the movable parts (41) of the shelves 
extend into the hollow uprights (51). 
A shop rack as claimed in any of claims 6-8, 
characterized by resetting means (57) cooperating in horizontal 

direction with the movable parts of the shelves. 
A shop rack as claimed in claim 7 or 8 and claim 9, 
characterized in that one of a pair of movable uprights 

opposing each other on different longitudinal sides of a rack 
is a pneumatic hose, and the other of said pair contains the 

resetting springs (57) cooperating with the movable parts (41) of the 
shelves.  

 
A shop rack as claimed in any of claims 3-10, 
characterized in that each pair of movable uprights (50,51) opposing 

each other on different longitudinal sides of a rack are 
rigidly interconnected through connectors (59).

the rack, which pinion is in engagement with at least one 

toothed rack (64,65). 
A shop rack as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, characterized by detection means arranged to cooperate 

with at least a section of the front of one or more shelves (33-37) to 
determine whether such section carries articles at the front 

side, and in the absence of articles at said front side of the 
sections can cause the conveyor means to be energized.
