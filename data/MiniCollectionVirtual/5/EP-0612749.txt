<ABSTRACT>
The improved method of desilylating a silylether 
compound which comprises reacting a silylether compound of 

the general formula (I): 

or a salt thereof
 

(where X is a methine substituted by an alkyl group having 
1 - 3 carbon atoms, methylene or a sulfur atom; R¹, R² and 

R³ which may be the same or different represent an alkyl 
group having 1 - 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 

1 - 6 carbon atoms, an aryl group or an aralkyl group; 
R⁴ represents a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted 

lower alkyl group, an optionally substituted lower alkylthio 
group, an optionally substituted lower alkoxy group, an 

optionally substituted heterocyclic group, an optionally 
substituted heterocyclic lower alkyl group, an optionally 

substituted heterocyclic thio group, an optionally 
substituted heterocyclic lower alkylthio group, an 

optionally substituted aryl group, an optionally substituted 
aryloxy group or an optionally su
bstituted aralkyl group; 
and R⁵ represents a hydrogen atom or a carboxylic acid 

protecting group) with an amine hydrogen fluoride salt of 
the general formula (II): 


(where R⁶, R⁷ and R⁸ which may be the same or different 
represent an alkyl group having 1 - 8 carbon atoms, an aryl 

group, an aralkyi group or a hydrogen atom; n is the number 
of hydrogen fluorides inherent in an amine salt of interest)  

 
or a pyridine hydrogen fluoride salt of the general formula 

(III):


Py·n (HF)   (III)



 
(where Py is an optionally substituted pyridine; n is the 

number of hydrogen fluorides inherent in a pyridine salt 
of interest) in an organic solvent, thereby producing a 

compound of the general formula (IV): 

(where X, R⁴ and R⁵ have the same meanings as defined 
above). According to this method, silylether compounds that 

are labile under strong acidic or basic conditions can be 
desilylated efficiently using inexpensive reagents.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of desilylating silylether
compounds.Various conventional methods are known to be applicable for
desilylating silylether compounds and they include:
(1) a method in which a quaternary ammonium fluoride such as
tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (n-Bu4NF) is caused to act in
an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (J. Am. Chem.
Soc., 1972, 94, 6190; Tetrahedron Lett., 1985, Vol. 26, No.
5, 681) ; (2) a method in which a mineral acid or a strong organic
acid is caused to act in an anhydrous organic solvent such as
acetonitrile or a hydrous organic solvent (Japanese Patent
Public Disclosure (KOKAI) No. Hei 1-83633) ; (3) a method in which N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) is caused to
act in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Synthesis, 1980, 234);(4) a method in which a hydrogensulfate of an alkali metal
is caused to act in a solvent such as water or alcohol
(Japanese Patent Public Disclosure (KOKAI) No. Sho 62-120325);(5) a method in which an aqueous solution of acetic acid is
caused to act (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1972, 94, 6190; and(6) a method in which excess potassium fluoride dihydrate is
reacted with excess tetrabutylammonium chloride in
acetonitrile (J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm.1979, 514 - 5).EP 0 567 949 A1 which is an intermediate document relates to
a method for removing a tri-substituted silyl protecting
group from a β-lactam compound which uses e.g. a mixture of a
hydrogenfluoride of an inorganic or organic amine such as
ammonium fluoride, a tri-lower alkylammonium fluoride, a
benzyl(di-lower alkyl)ammonium fluoride or a pyridinium
fluoride, and an acid. However, these conventional methods have their own problems.
Methods (1) and (6) suffer from an economic disadvantage in
that special and relatively expensive reagents such as n-Bu4NF
and tetrabutylammonium chloride must be used in more
than an equivalent amount with respect to the silylether
compound. Additionally, compounds which are labile under
strong acidic or basic conditions and optically active
compounds may be not be desilylated by these methods. Method
(2) has the problem of low yield in the production of the end
compound if the silylether compound to be treated has an
acid-labile group. Method (3) is not applicable to silylether
compounds that have an oxidation sensitive group. Method (4)
is not highly suitable for treatment of compounds that are
labile in 
prptonic solvents or the intended reaction will not progress
efficiently with such compounds.Under the circumstances, the present inventors
conducted intensive studies
