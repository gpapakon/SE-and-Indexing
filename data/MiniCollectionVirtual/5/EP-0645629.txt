<ABSTRACT>
A diagnostic agent for osteoporosis comprising bone 
sialoprotein of mammals. 
Osteoporosis can be diagnosed by bringing the body 
fluid sample collected from a living body into contact with 

the above-mentioned diagnostic agent to immunochemically 
detect the antibody which is present in the said sample and 

specifically reacts with the said diagnostic agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a diagnostic agent for 
osteoporosis which comprises a mammalian bone sialoprotein 
and a method for diagnosis of osteoporosis using the same. 
More particularly, this invention is concerned with a new 
immunochemical diagnostic agent and a new method for 
diagnosis, which can make pathogenetic classification of 
osteoporosis feasibility. Moreover, there may be suggested 
a different therapy from the prior ones, e.g., utilization 
of an immunosuppressing agent, to osteoporotic patients 
classified according to the present method. Degenerative osteoporosis is a syndrome showing a 
reduced amount of bone owing to unknown causes with aging 
after growth period and subsequent clinical pictures such 
as easy fractures of bones, lumbago and dorsalgia and the 
like. As the diagnostic methods for osteoporosis presently 
applied, there may be mentioned X-ray photographing of 
bones (MD method), DPA (Dual Photon Absorptiometry), DEXA 
(Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry), CXD (Computed X-ray 
Densitometry) and determination of a bone mineral amount, a 
bone density and the like by means of a physical apparatus  
 
for determining a bone amount using a low-frequency 
ultrasonic wave and the like. To determine a bone amount 
of an individual at a certain age according to such 
diagnostic methods makes it feasible to judge a person of 
his or her any future possibility of fractures. More 
specifically, a remarkable reduction in bone density could 
suggest a high risk of fractures in the future. It has been considered, however, that a reduced bone 
density is only one of dangerous factors for possible fractures 
and a fracture risk would be also increased owing to 
phenomena with aging such as a lowered elasticity of 
collagen fibers, qualitative deterioration of the bone 
structure, lowered muscular power and so on. These 
dangerous factors other than lowered muscular power could 
not presently be determined noninvasively, which remains as 
an important problem to be solved in the future. On the other hand, a noninvasive method for determining 
a bone density, which is a main diagnostic method for 
osteoporosis, and an invasive method for determining a bone 
form by biopsy have recently been developed remarkably. 
However, each of these methods alone may not satisfy all 
the clinical requirements, so that the most preferred 
determination method may be selected in compliance with the 
purpose and any optional combination therewith may be 
attempted under the present conditions. The maximum
