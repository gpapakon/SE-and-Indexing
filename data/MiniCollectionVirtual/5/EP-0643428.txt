<ABSTRACT>
A coated metal 
plate for positive electrode 

cans of alkaline dry cells, 
produced by coating a 

metal plate first with 
a chromate coating, 

preferably one containing 
carbon black, and then 

with a coating based on 
at least one of an epoxy 

resin, an epoxy/acrylic 
resin and a polyester resin, 

each containing carbon 
black having a purity 

of 95 % or above, an 
aspect ratio of 50 or above 

and an oil absorption of 
250 ml/100 g or above 

as measured by using 
powdery graphite and/or 

DBP having an average 
particle diameter of 50 µm 

or less, and optionnally 
further containing a 

cross-linking agent. The 
positive electrode can 

be produced merely by 
drawing the coated plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coated metal sheet that
makes it possible to produce alkaline dry cell positive
electrode cans (or anode cans) by only machining, and a
positive electrode can produced using such a metal sheet.Alkaline dry cells are hitherto used in low-voltage
(1.5 V) power sources of strobes, shavers, table clocks,
acoustic and electronic equipment and so forth. Positive
electrode cans used in such cells are those produced by
punching out a coated steel sheet such as a cold-rolled
steel sheet or a double-side Ni-coated steel sheet and
working the resulting sections by multiple drawing into
desired forms (in many instances, cylinders). However,
positive electrode cans made of such materials have the
problems that their inside surfaces come into contact with
high-concentration electrolytes and positive electrode
mixtures to form oxide layers on the surfaces of the
positive electrode cans, causing a lowering of cell
characteristics such as short-circuit current and
electromotive force as time lapses.Now, as a countermeasure for such a problem, a
method has been proposed in which the inside surface of a
positive electrode is directly coated with a conductive 
coating composition mixed with a carbon type conductive
agent in a large quantity of, e.g., 100 to 300 parts by
weight based on 100 parts by weight of resin so that its
corrosion resistance can be improved. This is a method in
which a carbon type conductive agent as exemplified by
graphite powder or acetylene black is mixed into a coating
composition comprising a resin with a good alkali
resistance such as polyvinyl isobutyl ether or vinyl
acetate resin and the resulting coating composition is
applied to the inside surface of a positive electrode can
(Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open No. 58-48361 and
No. 59-160959).Application of this conductive coating composition,
however, must be carried out without pretreatment of
positive electrode cans and by a very cumbersome operation
of spray-coating or brush-coating them one by one followed
by drying, and hence has had a poor productivity. In
addition, since the positive electrode cans are small in
diameter and nevertheless deep, it has been very difficult
from a technical viewpoint to uniformly coat the inside
surfaces. Accordingly, it has been sought to provide a
material from which positive electrode cans with a good
quality can be efficiently produced by only machining.Inexpensive materials that can meet such demands may
include coated steel sheets previously coated with a
conductive
