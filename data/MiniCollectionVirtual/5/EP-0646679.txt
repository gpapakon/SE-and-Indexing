<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a front-attachment or filter screen (1) for water-discharge fittings, having a number of throughflow or screen openings (2). The screen according to the invention is characterised in that the front-attachment screen (1) exhibits screen openings (2) which have an approximately identical hexagonal clear opening cross-section, and in that the mutually facing side walls (4) of adjacent screen openings (2) run approximately parallel to one another. The front-attachment screen according to the invention is distinguished by a comparatively low amount of noise formation, a high throughflow rate and, at the same time, also by good screening or cleaning action.

A strainer attachment or filtering strainer having a
number of flow or strainer apertures and taking the

form of a one-piece plastic injection-moulded part
for water taps, 
characterized in that
 the strainer
attachment (1) has strainer apertures (2) having

approximately equal hexagonal clear cross sections,
that the total aperture cross section, referred to

the total front surface of the strainer, is greater
than 40%, that the passage length of the strainer

apertures is always less than twice the largest
measure of a strainer aperture and that the side

walls (4) facing each other of adjacent strainer
apertures (2) are approximately parallel to each

other.
A strainer attachment as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the total aperture cross

section, referred to the total front surface of the
strainer (1) is 50%.
A strainer attachment as claimed in claim 1 or claim
2, characterized in that the ratio of the surface

portions between strainer apertures (2) and the
connections or side walls between them is 4:1 to 1:1,

preferably 3:1.
A strainer attachment as claimed in any one of claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the passage length of

the strainer apertures (2) in the flow direction
corresponds approximately to the largest open measure

of a strainer aperture. 
A strainer attachment as claimed in any one of claims
1 to 4, characterized in that the strainer attachment

(1) is of convex or conical curvature in the
direction of the inflow side.
A strainer attachment as claimed in any one of claims
1 to 5, characterized in that the edges (5, 8) of the

side walls (4) of the strainer apertures (2) are
rounded on their inflow and/or outflow sides.
A strainer attachment as claimed in any one of claims
1 to 6, characterized in that the strainer apertures

(2) are arranged approximately axially parallel to
the longitudinal strainer axis (L).
A strainer attachment as claimed in any one of claims
1 to 7, characterized in that the strainer attachment

(1) in the form of a one-piece plastic injection-moulded
part has an injection point particularly in

the region of the cone apex (3) on the inflow side.
A strainer attachment as claimed in any one of claims
1 to 8, characterized in that the strainer attachment

(1) is placed upstream of a check valve, a water flow
regulator, a throttle part or similar built-in

component for water taps, especially a jet regulator.
A strainer attachment as claimed in any one of claims
1 to 9, characterized in that the strainer attachment

(1) has a collar (6) having an annular locking groove
or similar locking recess (7) and that said locking

recess (7) is preferably detachably connectable to at
least one locking hook or similar locking means on

the inflow front side of the built-in component. 
A jet regulator, characterized in that placed
upstream of the same is a strainer attachment as

claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10.
