<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a process for producing aluminized structures on predetermined areas of a substrate made of aluminium nitride, characterised in that the said areas are irradiated by a UV laser (10) operating in pulse mode at a wavelength between 193 nm and 351 nm, the energy density on the said areas being greater than or equal to 500 mJ/cm
<

>
. The subject of the present invention is also an aluminized structure obtained by the preceding process, this structure comprising a layer of aluminium less than 1  mu m in thickness.
