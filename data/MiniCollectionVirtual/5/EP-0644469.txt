<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a timepiece with analogue display having at least one universal time display mode. This timepiece includes   - time display means consisting of an hour hand and of a minute hand,   - time-zone display means including at least one analogue member for tagging the said time zones and able to provide an item of information referring to the geographic position of the said time-zones, with respect to the Earth, - motive means able to drive the said analogue display members opposite time, respectively location indications, and - electronic control means conformed in order to drive the said display means, by actuation of the said motive means, this invention being characterised in that the said analogue member allowing the tagging of time-zones consists of at least one of the two time display hands, for example the hour hand, brought by the electronic control means into a distinctive position in combination with the other hand, in particular the minute hand.

Universal analogue display timepiece including an
hour display organ, a minute display organ, a time zone

selection organ and control means (4-33) for said organs
responding to a manual control signal to drive said

selection organ so as to select a time zone, said control
means (4-33) further responding to a time base signal (2)

and to a signal representative of said selected time zone
to drive said display organs so that they display time

data relating to said selected time zone,

characterized in that

said control means (4-33) further respond to said
manual control signal to superpose said display organs,
said selection organ is formed by said superposed
display organs and
said control means (4-33) respond to said manual
control signal to drive said superposed display organs to

an angular position selected from a plurality of twenty-four
distinct angular positions each corresponding to a

different time zone and
the timepiece includes a dial carrying a representation
seen from the side of the north pole, including

said twenty-four time zones.
Timepiece according to claim 1, characterized in
that the timepiece includes a stem able to be actuated by

a user to generate said manual control signal.
Timepiece according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said control means (4-33)

include a motor (20) for driving the hour display organ
and a motor (18) for driving the minute display organ.
Timepiece according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the control means (4-33)

include means for storing said selected angular position
generating said signal representing the selected time

zone.
Timepiece according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the control means (4-33) include

means for storing the time data for each time zone.
