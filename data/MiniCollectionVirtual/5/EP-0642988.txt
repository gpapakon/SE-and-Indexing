<ABSTRACT>
A Dot-Matrix system of adhesive application which will apply dots 
of adhesive to substrate material 16 to cause "Blister" packing 

enclosure 15 to adhere to the substrate material 16 along flanges 
17. The flanges 17 can either be pressed on to the substrate 16 

or drawn against it by vacuum. Various forms of substrate 
material can be used including cardboard, rigid or semi-rigid 

plastic, screen printed silk or any other relatively porous 
material. Application of the adhesive may be by the stylus of 

flexographic apparatus, lithoplate roller of lithographic 
processes or the roller in the Gravure printing process. The 

Dot-Matrix system of adhesive application will reduce the 
quantity of adhesive needed to secure a bond between the 

packaging film and the substrate material and such reduction in 
adhesive enables the film packaging to be manually moved from the 

substrate relatively easily.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION RELATES TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE KNOWN METHODS 
OF APPLYING ADHESIVE TO BACKING CARDS FOR BLISTER AND SKIN 
PACKAGING OF PRODUCTS, SINGLY OR IN NUMBER, THEREBY 
ENABLING BETTER SEPARATION OF THE COMPONENT PARTS OF A 
FORMED PACKAGE, ETC. The availability of clear or transparent plastic film has 
enabled the packaging and presentation of "goods" for sale 
or transport to the customer to take on a new dimension. To 
be able to see the "goods" one is to purchase gives 
confidence to the purchaser and reduces the cost of 
packaging for the supplier. The traditional method of 
enclosing goods within a cardboard carton or box often 
presented problems both for the supplier and the purchaser. 
When "goods" can be seen prior to purchase they can be 
readily compared against an existing item should it, or 
they, be replacement components.
 
Known art of enclosing "goods" within a clear plastic film 
is described as "blister" or "skin" packaging and comprises 
of a pre-formed or art enclosure of plastic film attached by 
adhesive to a backing card - usually of cardboard.  There are several methods of causing the "blister" 
encapsulation or the "skin" or "skinform" enclosure to 
adhere to the backing card and the backing card itself can 
perform more than one function. It can contain instruction, 
usage direction or simply advertisement text or logos.
 
Adhesive can be applied to the backing card and the clear 
plastic "blister" or film either pressed onto the adhesive 
or drawn against it by vacuum "pressure".
 
It is one aspect of the present invention to reduce the 
quantity or adhesive necessary to effect adhesion between 
"blister", "skin" and "skinform" packaging systems.
 
It is a second aspect of the present invention to enable the 
separation or the three said packaging systems and their 
backing cards to be made relatively easily and cleanly.  A specific embodiment of the invention will now be described 
solely by way of example, with reference to the accompanying 
drawings in which: 
Figure 1shows a "blister", "skin" and "skinform" pack 
enclosure. Figure 2(a)illustrates a "blister" package which has been 
produced using a dot matrix application of 
adhesive. Figure 2(b)illustrates a "skinpack" package which has been 
produced using dot matrix application of adhesive. Figure 2(c)illustrates a "skinform" package which has been 
produced using dot matrix application of 
adhesive. Figure 3illustrates the "dot matrix" method of adhesive 
application to screen printing. Figure 4shows the "dot
