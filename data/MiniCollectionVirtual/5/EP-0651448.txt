<ABSTRACT>
A metal-semiconductor (MSM) device comprises interdigitated 
metal electrodes (2, 3) on a semiconductor substrate (1). 

When embodied as a photoconductor, a photoconductive region 
(4) is bounded by layers (5, 6) which form a resonant cavity 

for incoming radiation to improve the response. In another 
embodiment, which can be either a photodiode or 

photoconductor, the electrodes are arranged to extend into 
the thickness of the photoresponsive layer (4). In order to 

reduce sensitivity to polarisation,the electrodes may be 
arranged in sets extending in mutually transverse 

directions. Groups of the electrodes may be connected so as 
to be sensitive to polarisation but substantially 

insensitive to amplitude of incoming radiation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved metal-semiconductor-metal
(MSM) photodetector device.Planar interdigitated electrode MSM photodetectors offer
high bandwidths and responsivity, and are therefore
attractive for optoelectronic integrated circuits for
optical communication, and for ultra fast optical
sampling measurements. The planar structure leads to low
parasitic capacitance, with consequent improvements in
both bandwidth and receiver sensitivity and very easy
integration with FETs such as MES FETs or HEMTs.A typical device structure is shown in Figure 1 and
consists of two sets of interdigitated electrodes 1, 2
formed by vapour deposition and lithography, on a
semiconductor sample. The electrode sets are biased with
respect to each other, so that alternate electrodes e.g.
2, 3 of the sets are at bias +V,-V etc. The width of
each electrode is w and the gap between the electrodes is
d.Our work with MSM devices has resulted in the discovery
that prior devices with generally parallel arrays of
interdigitated electrodes, exhibit a polarisation
sensitivity to incoming light. Thus, if the polarisation
direction of incoming light varies, the response of the 
MSM device varies in accordance with the direction of
polarisation. This gives rise to difficulties since the
output of the device cannot be calibrated unless the
polarisation of the incoming light is known.To overcome this problem the present invention provides
a MSM detector device comprising a photoresponsive region
for generating charge carriers in response to incoming
optical radiation, and electrode means to receive
carriers from the photoresponsive region produced by the
incoming radiation, said electrode means comprising first
and second interdigitated sets of electrodes, the
electrodes of at least one of the sets including portions
which extend in mutually transverse directions whereby to
desensitise the response of the device to the
polarisation of the incoming radiation.Preferably, the electrodes of each set thereof each
include a portion extending in a first direction and a
portion extending in a second orthogonal direction.Also, in some circumstances, it is desirable to detect
the polarisation of incoming radiation, independently of
its amplitude.To this end, the invention provides a MSM detector device
comprising:
a photoresponsive region for generating charge carriers 
in respect to incoming radiation, and electrode means to
receive carriers from the photoresponsive region produced
by the incoming radiation, said electrode means
