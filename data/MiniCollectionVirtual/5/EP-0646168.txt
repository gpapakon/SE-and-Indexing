<ABSTRACT>
A bleaching composition useful for the bleaching of stained articles, comprises (a) a urea clathrate of a diacyl or tetraacyl peroxide, e.g. dinonanoyl peroxide, dioctanoyl peroxide or diperoxyazelaic diacetate. The composition may also comprise (b) a compound capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous medium, e.g sodium perbonate. The composition, which can be effective against carotenoid stains, is generally in granular form and may be formulated as a laundry detergent composition that also comprises (c) an anionic, nonionic, cationic, ampholytic or zwitterionic detersive surfactant and, optionally, (d) a detergent builder and/or (e) a bleach activator.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BLEACHING COMPOSITIONSField of inventionThe present invention relates to compositions that are useful in the bleaching of stains from soiled articles, including and of particular use in the bleaching of carotenoid-containing stains. In one aspect, the invention relates to such compositions that are in the form of detergent compositions comprising one or more detersive surfactants.Background to the inventionIt is well known to incorporate into a detergent composition an inorganic compound that is capable of yielding hyrdogen peroxide in an aqueous medium, a common example of such a compound being sodium perbonate. The resultant compositions are effective in the removal of certain hydrophilic stains, for example those due to tea, wine or fruit juice, but, on its own, the bleaching agent has to be used at a temperature of at least 60°C. In order to render such compositions effective at lower temperatures, for example 30-40°C, it has been proposed to add an activator, such as tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) , such activators being thought to react in solution with the perbonate and thereby yield peroxyacetic acid. In order to bleach such hydrophobic stains as those due to grass, motor oil, paprika and the "dinginess" associated with repeated laundering of fabrics, it has been proposed to add monanoyloxybenzene sulfonate (NOBS) , which is an aqueous medium in the presence of perbonate is thought to produce peroxynonanoic acid. However, there are a number of common soils that give rise to hydrophobic stains that are resistant to the NOBS/perbonate system, such stains being due to carotenoid chromophores, e.g. β-carotene, lycopene, zeaxanthin or capsanthin. Typical soils giving rise to such stains include carrot and tomato, and baby-SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 foods and sauces containing or or both of these, as well as various tropical fruits and saffron.One proposal for the removing of a wide range of stains, including such hyrophobic stains as those caused by tomato sauce, is described in EP-A-0,337,535, which recommends the use of a bleaching composition that comprises (i) a peroxygen bleaching compound capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous medium, preferably sodium perbonate monohydrate or tetrahydrate, and (ii) a bleach precursor having the general formula R-CO-L wherein R is one of certain aromatic or substituted aromatic radicals, e.g. a (Ci-Cg-alkyl)phenyl or unsubstituted phenyl group, and wherein L is a leaving group, preferably a 4-sulfophenyl group, the molar ratio of hydrogen peroxide to
