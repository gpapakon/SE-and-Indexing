<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of managing the beam of a rotating electronic-scanning antenna. For each antenna revolution, the linking of the commands is organised into three phases (71, 72, 75) associated with the regions of space:   - a first phase (71) of preparing the aiming angles demanded before they come into the cone of visibility of the antenna; - a second phase (72) of implementing the aiming demanded present in the cone of visibility; - a third phase of marking the aiming angles demanded outside of the cone of visibility and not implemented.   Application: multifunction radar.

Method for the management of the beam of an
electronically scanned rotating antenna on the basis of

requests for the aiming of the beam (2), organizing the
sequencing of the aiming commands given to a system for

the formation of the beam (3) by means of a table of
commands (74) comprising the parameters needed to carry

out the aiming operations, the antenna having a
visibility cone (6) in which the electronic scanning

enables the aiming operations to be performed, the
position of the antenna being identified according to

an angular step (5), the passage from one step to
another generating a synchronization signal (73), for

each antenna rotation, the sequencing of the commands
is organized in three phases (71, 72, 75), each

associated with one zone (15, 16, 17) of space:

a first phase (15, 71) of preparation of the
requested aiming operations before their entry into the

visibility cone, consisting in defining the parameters
of the table of the commands associated with each

requested aiming operation;
a second phase (16, 72) of performing the
requested aiming operations present in the visibility

cone,
a new table of commands being sent on the
basis of each synchronization signal as a function of

the aiming operations that have not yet been performed;
a third phase (17, 75) of identifying the
requested aiming operations that have come out from the

visibility cone and have not been performed, these 
being memorized and performed in a following rotation,

it being possible for a non-performed aiming operation
to be relinquished.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that urgent aiming operations requested during the

second phase are performed in this phase.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the zones (15, 17)

associated with the first (71) and third phases do not
overlap.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the requests for aiming

operations designed for a watching function are
generated automatically (82) and processed lik
e the
other requests for aiming operations (81) according to

the three phases (71, 72, 75).
Method according to claim 4 characterized in
that, with the space around the antenna being

partitioned into elementary aiming spaces, the
elementary spaces (12) being inscribed in columns (11),

for automatic generation, the aiming operations are
assembled in a number p of consecutive patterns, p

being the number of antenna rotations necessary for the
repetition of patterns to cover the space considered

(91), each pattern (92) being chosen on a number r of
consecutive columns, the passage being made to a

following pattern (93) at the end of r columns, the
return being made to the first pattern (92) at the end

of p x r columns.
Method according to claim 5, characterized in
that the patterns are different from one part (91) of

the space to another, as a function of the altitude.
Method according to either of claims 5 and 6,
characterized in that the number p is different from

one part (91) of the space to another, as a function of
the altitude.
Method according to any one of claims 5 to 7,
characterized in that the automatic generation includes 

one mode for a good weather state and another mode for
a bad weather state.
Method according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the partitioning of the

space is a function of the altitude.
Method according to claim 9, characterized in
that the number of elementary aiming spaces diminishes

with the altitude.
