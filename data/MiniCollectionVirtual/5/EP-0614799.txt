<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a brake shoe (1) for a 
bicycle wherein the thickness of the brake shoe (1) is 

greater at the rear end (112) than at the front end 
(111) to provide a gradually sloping brake surface (11). 

The sloping brake surface (11) is provided with a 
plurality of grooves (12, 13), the grooves extending 

substantially obliquely across the brake surface (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bicycle brake 
shoe assemblies, and relates more particularly to the 
brake shoe for a bicycle brake shoe assembly. An ordinary brake caliper assembly generally 
has two brake shoe assemblies respectively fastened to 
an outer brake arm and an inner brake arm. Each brake 
shoe assembly is generally comprised of a brake shoe 
fastened to a brake shoe holder. In use, the brake shoe 
of each brake shoe assembly is moved to press upon the 
rim of a bicycle wheel to stop its movement. The brake 
shoe commonly has a flat brake surface which abuts a 
bicycle wheel rim during braking. When pressed on the 
rim of a bicycle wheel to stop its movement, an inertia 
effect occurs in causing the bicycle rider to bend 
forwards and the tyre to heavily rub against the ground, 
and therefore the bicycle rider may fall from the 
bicycle and the tyre may wear away easily.  The present invention has been accomplished 
under the aforesaid circumstances. It is therefore an 
object of the present invention to provide a bicycle 
brake shoe assembly which reduces or eliminates the 
occurrence of an inertia effect during braking of a 
bicycle. It is another object of the present invention 
to provide a bicycle brake shoe assembly which 
automatically guides water away from the brake shoe to 
ensure enhanced brake efficiency. It is still another 
object of the present invention to provide a bicycle 
brake shoe assembly which is durable in use. According to the present invention there is 
provided a brake shoe for a bicycle as claimed in claim 1. The advantage of the invention is that the 
movement of a bicycle wheel is stopped gradually thus 
substantially reducing the occurrence of an inertia 
effect. Preferably, the sloping brake surface is 
provided with at least one groove for guiding water away 
from the brake surface. The advantage of this feature is that it 
enhances braking efficiency and ensures a positive 
braking effect is maintained. Preferably, there is provided a plurality of 
grooves in the sloping brake surface the grooves 
extending substantially obliquely across the sloping 
brake surface. This arrangement of oblique grooves has  
 
been found to significantly enhance the removal of water 
from the brake surface. The foregoing and other objects, features and 
advantages of the present invention will be best 
understood from the following description, the appended 
claims and the accompanying drawings in which:
