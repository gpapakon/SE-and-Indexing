<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of producing xylitol from 
D-glucose, D-fructose, D-galactose or mixtures thereof. Amongst the pentitols only xylitol possesses a commercially 
important value. Today the large scale production of 
xylitol is based on hydrogenation of D-xylose as described 
in US-A- 4,008,285. D-xylose is being prepared through 
hydrolysis of hardwood, straw, corn cobs, oat hulls or 
other xylan-rich plant material. D-xylose may also be 
recovered as a side product from the acidic spent liquors 
of the sulphite process or other processes that are being 
used for pulping of hardwoods or other xylan-rich material. The production costs of xylitol are relatively high because 
the yield of D-xylose is typically low and complex 
processes are needed for its purification. In the hope of a 
more cost-effective production method it has been suggested 
in several occasions that D-glucose should or could be used 
as a raw material in the synthesis of xylitol. In principle the synthesis of D-xylose from D-glucose looks 
very straightforward; the two molecules are identical 
except for an additional hydroxymethyl group at C-5 atom of 
D-glucose. Because of the apparent similarity of the 
molecules most effort has been put on developing methods of 
selectively cleaving the bond between C-5 and C-6 atoms of 
D-glucose. Kiss et al. (Helv. Chim. Acta 58 (1975) 311) 
converted D-glucose to 
1,2-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D-glucofuranose, oxidatively 
cleaved the bond between the C-5 and C-6 atoms with 
periodate, removed the protecting isopropylidene group 
through hydrolysis and finally hydrogenated the resulting  
 
xylo-dialdose to xylitol. Later Malmelin (M.Sc. thesis, 
Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo 1978) evaluated 
the chemical costs in this method and found them too high 
for a large-scale production. At the end of the 1960'ies Onishi ja Suzuki (Appl. 
Microbiol. 18 (1969) 1031) introduced a fermentation 
process for making xylitol from D-glucose through 
D-arabinitol and D-threo-2-pentulose (D-xylulose) as 
intermediates. The yield of xylitol was, however, low 
(14%). Later the individual reaction steps of this process 
were developed by Ohmomo et al. (J. Ferment. Technol. 61 
(1983) 373, 63 (1985) 331). They also presented a 
modification in which D-xylulose was treated with 
D-xylulose isomerase and the resulting mixture of 
D-xylulose and D-xylose fermented to xylitol. In another 
modification D-xylose was separated from the isomerization 
product mixture and converted to xylitol through
