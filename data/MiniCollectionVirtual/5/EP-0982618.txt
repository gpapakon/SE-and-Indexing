<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is based on Japanese
Patent Application No. 10-240613 filed August 26, 1998, the
content of which is incorporated hereinto by reference.The present invention relates to a presbyopia
correction contact lens whose optical portions respectively
providing a near vision correction region and a distant
vision correction region have a common optical center.As a contact lens for vision correction of an eye
suffering from decreasing accommodation such as presbyopia,
there has been proposed a multifocal-type presbyopia
correction contact lens having a plurality of vision
correction regions which provide respectively determined
mutually different optical powers. The multifocal-type
presbyopia correction contact lens is generally classified
into two types: an alternating or translating vision type
contact lens, wherein the vision correction regions
including a near and a distant vision correction region are
selectively and alternatively used as needed in observing
objects, with a shift of the visual axis of the lens user;
and a simultaneous vision type contact lens, wherein the 
vision correction regions are simultaneously used, and a
desired image observed through one of the vision correction
regions is selected by an action of the lens wearer's brain.
In the field of the contact lens, the simultaneous vision
type contact lens prevails over the alternating vision type
contact lens since it is rather difficult to select an
appropriate vision correction region for observing the
object at a desired distance.As one example of the simultaneous vision type
presbyopia correction contact lens, there is proposed a
so-called bifocal contact lens having two focal points which
respectively correspond to the near and distant vision
correction regions.US Patent No. 4,636,049 discloses one example of
the bifocal contact lens, wherein the back surface of the
optical zone of the lens, i.e., a cornea-contacting surface,
serves as a base curved surface having a profile
corresponding to that of the cornea of the lens user's eye,
and two concentric regions having respective different radii
of curvature are formed on the front surface of the optical
zone, so that the two concentric regions provide two optical
portions which serve as one and the other of the near and
distant vision correction regions.The bifocal contact lens constructed as described
above, however, tends to suffer from various problems such
as ghosting or double imaging, and mutual interference of
the images obtained through the near and distant
