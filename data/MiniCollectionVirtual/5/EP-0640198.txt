<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a boiler (1) wherein at least one steam generating circuit comprises an ejector (25) capable of providing induced circulation of water in the boiler in normal operating conditions. The corresponding water/steam separation reservoir (17) is arranged at any height with respect to the outlet collector (manifold) (15) of the evaporator device (11) of said circuit.

Heat recovery boiler (1) comprising one or 
more steam generating circuits, possibly at different 

pressures, comprising each : 

a water/steam separating balloon (17), 
a bladed tube evaporating device arranged 
horizontally in a hot gas stream, 
descending (19) and rising (21) tubes so as 
to provide a communication between the balloon (17) and the 

evaporating device (11) via an inlet manifold (13) and an 
outlet manifold (15), 
 
characterized in that at least a steam generating circuit 

comprises a settable ejector (25) adapted to limit the 
power fluid flow rate in starting operation and to provide 

a water induced circulation in the boiler (1) in normal 
operation. 
Boiler according to claim 1, characterized in 
that, in case of a plurality of steam recovery circuits, 

each steam generating circuit comprises an ejector (25) 
adapted to provide a water induced circulation in the 

boiler (1) in normal operation. 
Boiler according to claim 2, characterized 
in that it is circulation pump free. 
Boiler according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the ejector (25) is arranged on a 

supply line (7). 
Boiler according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that each steam generating circuit 

comprising an ejector (25) includes also means adapted to 
provide a minimum flow rate allowing for the operation of  

 
said ejector (25) during the starting step of the boiler 

(1). 
Boiler according to claim 5, characterized in 
that an auxiliary starting pump (31) is provided on a line 

(27) shunted between a point of the descending tube (19) 
and a point of the supply line (7) located upstream the 

ejector (25). 
Boiler according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the balloon (17) of said steam generating circuit 

is provided, in the water zone thereof, with a device (33) 
adapted to allow for the balloon (17) being drained during 

the starting step. 
Boiler according to any of preceding claims, 
characterized in that each ejector (25) is provided, at the 

conical nozzle (43) thereof, with a movable setting needle 
(45). 
Boiler according to any of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the heigth difference between the 

balloon (17) of a steam generating circuit and the outlet 
manifold (15) of the corresponding evaporating device (11) 

is null. 
Boiler according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the balloon (17) of a steam 

generating circuit is arranged at a lower heigth than the 
outlet manifold (15). 
Boiler according to any of preceding claims, 
characterized in that the water/steam separating balloon 

(17) is arranged at a heigth which is lower, equal or 
'higher than the outlet manifold (15) of the evaporating 

device (11) of the steam generating circuit. 
Process for use of a boiler (1) according to 
claim 1, characterized in that it consists in carrying out 

the following steps of : 

introducing water into the evaporating device  
 

(11) and the balloon (17) of at least one steam generating 
circuit through a feed pump (5), up to a so-called starting 

level, 
activating a means so as to provide a minimum 
flow rate of a power fluid allowing for the operation of 

the ejector (25) during the starting phase, in a minimum 
setting, 
heating the boiler (1), and 
activating again the feed pump (5) so as to 
allow for the ejector (25) to provide the inducted 

circulation during the normal operation of the boiler (1). 
Process according to claim 12, characterized 
in that, during the starting phase, a mobile needle (45) is 

introduced into a part of the ejector (25) consisting in a 
conical nozzle (43), and in that it is activated so as to 

regulate the water flow rate depending upon needs.
