<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and also an apparatus for producing a concentrated protein extract from the liquid phase of slurry (liquid manure). The latter is substantially freed from solids by centrifugation and is enriched with a rapidly-growing yeast having a high carbon content, a high oxygen proportion and containing nitrogen and hydrogen, the slurry being circulated (3, 4) under the action of a slight superatmospheric pressure in two vessels (1, 2) at a temperature of about 37@ Celsius up to the formation of assimilated protein so that the remaining liquid can be taken off as a purified product (7, 8).

Process for obtaining a concentrated protein extract 
from liquid manure by adding a rapidly growing yeast 

with a high carbon content, a high oxygen fraction as 
well as nitrogen, hydrogen and trace elements which are 

metered according to an analysis of the liquid manure, 
characterised in that the yeast is added to the liquid 

manure, which is largely liberated by centrifuging 
solid matter, the liquid manure is circulated in a 

circuit with acceleration sections and moderating 
intervals at a temperature of approximately 37° Celsius 

and under the effect of a pressure slightly above 
atmospheric until a protein assimilate is formed, and 

the remaining liquid is subsequently drawn off. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
circulation takes place in relatively small partial 

streams between greater moderating quantities. 
Device for carrying out the process according to claim 
1, characterised in that it comprises 


at least two vessels (1, 2), the interiors of which 
communicate with one another via conduits (3, 4), which 

are alternately connected by one end at the bottom to 
one vessel and by the other end at the top to the other 

vessel, 
means (5, 6) for separately pressurizing each of the 
two vessels (1, 2) and relieving them of pressure, 
outlets (7, 8), which can be shut off, for liquid 
leaving the vessels and 
devices (9, 10) for feeding additives into the 
vessels in a metered manner. 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
two top vessel ends communicate with one another via 

another conduit with a shutoff valve disposed therein. 
Device according to claims 3 and 4, characterised in 
that the conduits (5, 6) between the two vessels (1, 2) 

are disposed at an angle of approximately 45° to the 
vertical. 
Device according to claim 1 and one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that 


the interiors of two elongate vessels (1, 2) disposed 
horizontally side-by-side communicate with one another 

in at least one sub-region of one vessel end via pipes 
(12, 13), one end of which is connected at the bottom 

to one of the two vessels and the other end of which is 
connected at the top to the other of the two vessels, 
at least one vessel (2) comprises at this end an 
intake connection (7) for the liquid manure and at 

least one vessel (1) comprises at the opposite vessel 
end a discharge connection (8) for the ferment and 
at least one vessel (1) is provided with a heating 
unit (9) and both vessels (1, 2) are provided with 

means for supplying air (10) and pressurizing the 
vessel interior. 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
pipes (11, 12) via which the two vessel interiors 

communicate with one another are provided in a 
plurality of sections (13, 14). 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
pipes (11, 12 or 13, 14) via which the interiors of the 

two vessels (1, 2) communicate with one another are  
 

disposed in a plurality of sections over the entire 
length of the two vessels (1, 2). 
Device according to claims 6 and 8, characterised in 
that the intake connection (7) for the liquid manure is 

disposed at one end of one vessel (2) and the discharge 
connection (8) for the ferment is disposed at the 

opposite end of the other vessel (1).
