<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process for accumulating a poly-3-hydroxy
butyric acid in bacterial cells by continuously

fermenting a methanol-assimilating bacterium having a
capability of producing a poly-3-hydroxy butyric acid, in a

single fermentation vessel by using methanol as carbon
source at a limited feeding rate of nitrogen, phosphorus,

or potassium such that the average retention time for the
fermentation is more than 10.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a poly-3-hydroxy butyric acid (hereinafter
referred to as PHB).More particularly, the present invention is addressed
to a single stage continuous fermentation process for the
production of bacterial cells containing a poly-3-hydroxy
butyric acid.PHB is produced and accumulated as an energy storage
substance in bacterial cells of a large number of
microorganisms. Since PHB is a thermoplastic polymer
exhibiting an excellent biodegradability and
biocompatibility, it has attracted attention as a "clean"
plastic which does not destroy environment.Also, PHB has been expected for many years to apply in
various fields including biomedical materials such as
surgical threads and fracture braces, and gradually
releasing systems where a drag or pesticide is gradually
released to environment.Particularly, since synthetic plastics have caused
serious public problems from the standpoint of
environmental pollution as well as resource circumstances
in recent years, PHB has been watched with an interest as a
biopolymer which does not rely upon petroleum.Heretofore, several processes for producing PHB have
been proposed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication
Nos. 60-214888 and 60-251889, and Examined Japanese Patent
Publication Nos. 02-20238 and 03-65154. The Examined Japanese Patent Publication No. 02-20238
has disclosed a process for the production of PHB by
continuously fermenting bacterial cells of a genus of
Alcaligenes by using glucose as a source of carbon
(hereinafter may be referred to as substrate) under a
condition of restricted growth by limiting the feeding of
nitrogen or phosphorus.The Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. 60-214888
and Examined Japanese Patent Publication No. 03-65154
have disclosed processes for producing PHB by
fermenting bacterial cells of a genus of Azotobacter or
Protomonas in a batch method under a condition of
restricted growth similar to that used for the genus of
Alcaligenes.However, these processes are unsatisfactory in
commercial production of PHB due to their high production
cost. Further, those processes have such a defect that the
production cost of PHB can not be brought to a low level
since a main nutrient used for growing bacterial cells,
namely, a carbon source is expensive, that the accumulation
of PHB by a continuous fermentation is insufficient, or
that the production process is complicated since two stages
fermentations are required.The cost of a raw material (that is, a substrate) is
an important factor
