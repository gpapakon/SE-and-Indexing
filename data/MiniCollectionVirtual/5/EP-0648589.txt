<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a key (1), in particular a 
vehicle ignition key, the process including an initial 

step for forming an elongated metal insert (2); a step 
for co-molding a first plastic material on to the metal 

insert (2); and a step for co-molding a second plastic 
material covering at least partly the first plastic 

material and contributing towards defining the grip (3) 
of the key (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a key, in particular a vehicle ignition key.Ignition keys are normally produced by clanking an
elongated metal insert constituting the active portion
of the key, and co-molding plastic material on to one
end of the insert to form a grip. Firm adhesion between
the two parts is achieved by means of a hole in the
insert, which, when filled with the plastic material
constituting the grip, forms a mechanical fastener. EP-A-401541 and US-A-3427833 disclose a key, in particular
a vehicle ignition key, according to the above description.JP-A-60-199622 discloses a production process comprising an
initial step of forming a metal insert, a step for co-moulding
a first plastic material onto the metal insert and
a step for covering at least part of the first plastic
material. The above processes present several drawbacks.In particular, molding is inevitably accompanied
by shrinkage resulting in irregular surface finish of
the grip and hence in poor quality of the finished
product in terms of both size and appearance. In
addition to the above technical drawback,
single-material keys produced using known methods are
limited to a very narrow range of materials which must
be both mechanically strong and of pleasing appearance.It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a process for producing a key, in particular a
vehicle ignition key, designed to overcome the drawbacks
typically associated with known processes.According to the present invention, there is
provided a process for producing a key, in particular a
vehicle ignition key, as defined in claim 1.A preferred non-limiting embodiment of the present
invention will be described by way of example with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 shows a partial front view of a key
formed using a process
not subject-matter of
the present
invention and described for a better comprehension thereof;Figure 2 shows a section along line II-II in
Figure 1;Figures 3a to 3f show successive steps in the
formation of the Figure 1 key;Figure 4 shows a partial front view of a key
formed using the process
according to the present invention;Figure 5 shows a section along line V-V in Figure
4;Figures 6a to 6c show successive steps in the
formation of the Figure 4 key.Number 1 in Figure 1 indicates a key formed using 
a process not subject-matter of the present invention and described
for a better comprehension thereof.Key 1 substantially comprises an elongated metal
insert 2 (shown partially); and a grip
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a key (1), in particular a
vehicle ignition key, comprising the steps of forming a

metal insert (2), co-molding a first plastic material on to
said metal insert (2) and covering at least part of said

first plastic material, characterized in that said step for
co-molding a first plastic material comprises the step of

forming a hollow seat (32) in said first plastic material;
and in that said process further comprises the steps of

inserting an insert (31) inside said hollow seat (32).
A process for producing a key (1) as claimed in Claim 1,
characterized in that said covering step comprises a step

for co-molding a second plastic material.
A process for producing a key (1) as claimed in Claim 1
or 2, characterized in that said step for co-molding a

first plastic material comprises the steps of:

inserting an end portion (4) of said metal insert (2)
inside a first cavity (20) of a first mold (16);
pressure injecting molten said first plastic material
into said first cavity (20) to form the core (12) of said

key (1);
setting said first plastic material; and
removing said core (12) from said first cavity (20).
A process for producing a key (1) as claimed in Claims 2
and 3, characterized in that said step for co-molding a

second plastic material comprises the steps of:

inserting said core (12) inside a second cavity (25) of a
secon
d mold (21);
pressure injecting molten said second plastic material
into said second cavity (25);
setting said second plastic material; and
removing the finished said key (1) from said second
cavity (25).
A process as claimed in one of the foregoing Claims,
characterized in that, after said step of inserting said

insert (31), and before said covering step, a step is
performed of forming a closing element (33) of said seat

(32) to insulate said insert (31) from said covering.
A process as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that
said closing element (33) is formed by injecting resin. 
A key (1), in particular a vehicle ignition key,
comprising a metal insert (2) and a grip (3); characterized

in that said grip (3) comprises an inner core (12) co-molded
on to said metal insert (2), made of a first plastic

material, and a covering (13) for said core (12), made of a
second plastic material, and in that said core (12) has a

seat (32) housing an insert (31).
