<ABSTRACT>
A separator for electrical cells is obtained using a 
bulky synthetic pulp sheet. A bulky synthetic pulp sheet 

is provided, which comprises 50 to 95% by weight of a 
synthetic pulp having a drainage factor over a range of 

from 0.1 to 2.0 sec/g and 5 to 50 % by weight of a polymer 

binder having a melting point lower than the melting point 
or decomposition temperature of the synthetic pulp; the 

sheet has an apparent density of 0.15 g/cm³ or less under a 
load of 200 g/cm². A process for the preparation of the 

bulky synthetic pulp sheet is also provided, comprising 
subjecting a mixture of the synthetic pulp and the fibrous 

binder to wet-type sheet-making and heat treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing a bulky synthetic pulp sheet which does not lose
shape even after having absorbed liquid and to a process
for preparing the same. More specifically, the invention
relates to a bulky synthetic pulp sheet having excellent
resistance against chemicals such as acids, alkalis, etc.
in addition to the above-mentioned property and to a
process for preparing the same. The invention further
relates to a sealed lead and a separator for
cells.Methods have heretofore been proposed for preparing
bulky sheets that are used for absorbing liquids or are
used as buffer members for imparting elasticity. These
methods use a cellulose pulp as a chief material and
further add, for example, folded synthetic fibers
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 132900/1989) or
three-dimensionally crimped synthetic resin fibers
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 269199/1991) in
order to impart bulkiness.However, these bulky sheets which are chiefly
composed of a cellulose pulp are inferior in resistance
against chemicals, and are not suited for such
applications as absorbing and holding strongly acidic
liquids such as sulfuric acid and the like acid.Therefore, it has been strongly demanded to provide
articles capable of absorbing chemicals that are leaked or
spilled and capable of holding an electrolyte therein,
like a separator used in a sealed lead battery, that 
can be cheaply produced and used safely.The object of the present invention is to provide a
synthetic pulp sheet which is bulky, holds a liquid
favorably, has excellent dimensional stability yet
flexible, does not lose the shape even in a water-absorbed
condition, and is stable against acids and
alkalis.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a separator for sealed lead storage batteries which
favorably holds sulfuric acid also, holds electrolytes
substances during the charge and discharge being inserted
among the electrode plates, and works to effectively
prevent them from leakage.A further object of the present invention is to
provide a process for easily preparing a bulky open-cell
foam porous and liquid-holding synthetic pulp sheet using
a cheaply available material.According to the present invention, there is provided
a bulky synthetic pulp sheet containing 50 to 95 % by
weight of a synthetic pulp having a drainage factor over a
range of from 0.1 to 2.0 sec/g, 5 to 50 % by weight of a
polymer binder having a melting point lower than a melting
point or a decomposition temperature of said
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a bulky synthetic pulp
sheet comprising a synthetic pulp and a fibrous polymer

binder and having an apparent density of 0.15 g/cm
3
 or
smaller under a load of 200 g/cm
2
, said apparent density
being obtained by the following formula:


D = W/10t

wherein D is the apparent density of the sheet (g/cm
3
), W is
the mass (g) of a piece of the sheet having a size of 100 mm

x 100 mm, which is taken from a center portion of the sheet,
and t is the average thickness (mm) of said piece, wherein

the process comprises the steps of: subjecting an aqueous
slurry of a mixture of 50 to 95% by weight of a synthetic

pulp having a drainage factor, measured by the method in
accordance with the standards of TAPPI-T221 at a basis weight

of 500 g/m
2
 sheet, of from 0.1 to 2.0 sec/g, 5 to 50% by
weight of a fibrous polymer binder having a melting point

lower than the melting point or decomposition temperature of
the synthetic pulp, and, optionally, 40% by weight or less of

auxiliary materials to wet-laid sheet making on a wire with
the addition of a surfactant to the wet sheet during the wet-laid

sheet making, followed by dehydration of the wet-sheet,
drying of the dehydrated sheet and heat-treating the dried

sheet.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the
surfactant is an anionic surfactant.
A process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the
surfactant is sprayed onto the sheet in an amount of from 0.1

to 10% by weight, based on the weight of the solid
components.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein the dehydration is suction dehydration, dehydration

under pressure or both.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4
wherein the heat treatment is performed at a temperature

higher than the melting point of the binder but lower than
the melting point of the synthetic pulp.
