<ABSTRACT>
An iron golf clubhead includes a blade (11) which is formed 
from a first material and a hosel (12) and a junction portion (13) which 

are formed from a second material which is less dense than the 
material of the blade. The blade includes a toe end and a heel 

end and a flat bracket (26) which extends from the heel (32) end. The 
junction portion (13) surrounds the bracket (26) and is secured thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an iron type golf 
clubhead according to the preamble of claim 1. An iron clubhead includes a blade, which includes the 
club face for striking a golf ball, and a hosel, to which the 
shaft is secured. A junction portion connects the hosel and the 
blade. Iron clubheads are conventionally forged or cast in a 
single, integral piece from metal or metal alloy. Some clubheads are formed from two or more different 
materials. For example, a metal core can be covered with 
fiber-reinforced composite material, or the face and back of the 
clubhead can be formed from different materials. In such cases, 
however, the hosel and junction are generally formed integrally 
with a portion of the blade.  
 The GB-A-2 192 795 discloses a composite golf club iron 
head comprising a hosel for attaching the head to a shaft, 
a front surface defined by a heel, a sole, a toe, a topline 
and a backweight. The hosel, heel and a portion of the toe 
form a unitary member and are made of a material of a first 
weight density; the sole, backweight, remainder of the toe 
and a majority of the front surface are -- as a second 
unitary member -- formed of a material of a second weight 
density, said second weight density being higher than said 
first weight density, whereby the weight distribution of 
said head is greatest adjacent the centre of said front 
surface. The said first unitary member is made of epoxy-impregnated 
graphite, and the second unitary member is made 
of steel. This iron clubhead is said to provide better 
durability, a better weight distribution, a better 
utilisation of the mass of the head and better control of 
the location of the centre of gravity which tends to reduce 
the likelihood of an errant shot.  
 Each numbered golf iron, for example a 5 iron, has a 
standard weight which does not vary much between various 
manufacturers of golf clubs. A typical iron clubhead has about 
78% of its weight in the blade area and about 22% of its weight 
in the junction area. Ball flight and distance is affected by 
the weight of the blade and the manner in which the weight is 
distributed in the blade. The weight in the hosel and the 
junction area has little or no effect on the ball. Some clubs have redistributed weight from the hosel to 
the blade by forming openings or cutouts in the hosel. However, 
such openings interrupt the integrity of the hosel. Other clubs 
have reduced the length of the hosel or eliminated the hosel. 
However, the attachment of the shaft to the clubhead can be 
adv

<CLAIMS>
An iron type golf clubhead having a blade (11), a 
hosel (12), and a junction portion (13) which joins the 

blade and the hosel, the blade having a toe end (15) and a 
heel end (16) and a face (17) for striking a golf ball, the 

blade being formed from a first material and the hosel 
being formed from a second material which is less dense 

than the first material,
 
characterized in 


that the blade (11) includes a bracket (26) which extends 
from the heel end (16) and which is thinner than the blade 

(11) at the heel end, the junction portion (13) surrounding 
the bracket and being secured thereto. 
The clubhead of claim 1 in which the bracket (26) 
is provided with openings (30) through which the material 

of the junction portion (13) extends. 
The clubhead of claim 1 or 2 in which the bracket 
(26) includes curved top and bottom edges (27, 28). 
The clubhead of one of the claims 1 to 3 in which 
the face (17) is provided with parallel grooves (18) which 

extend between the toe end (15) and heel end (16) of the 
blade (11), each groove having a toe end and a heel end, 

the heel end of the blade extending substantially 
perpendicularly to the heel ends of the grooves and being 

spaced about 2,54 to 5,08 mm (0.10 to 0.20 inch) from the 
heel ends of the grooves. 
The clubhead of claim 4 in which the heel 
end (16) of the blade (11) is spaced about 3,81 mm (0.15 

inch) from the heel ends of the grooves (18). 
The clubhead of one of the claims 1 to 5 in which 
the bracket (26) is substantially flat.  

 
The clubhead of one of the claims 1 to 6 in which 

the weight of the blade (11) is from about 85 to 95 % of 
the total weight of the clubhead (10) and the weight of the 

hosel (12) and junction portion (13) is from about 5 to 
15 % of the total weight of the clubhead.
