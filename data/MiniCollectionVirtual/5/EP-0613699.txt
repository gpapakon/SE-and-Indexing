<ABSTRACT>
A respiratory aviation mask (20) utilises a light-weight pyramid shell (21), surmounted 
by a triangular peripheral resilient rubber seal (22) for contact with a wearer's face 

contours, and with an embedded seal stiffener (23) comprising a series of inward 
sprung fingers (24) disposed for pre-loading the seal when mounting the mask and 

preserving seal contact under extremes of differential pressure and 'g' loading.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to seals and is, particularly but not exclusively, concerned with 
seals for respiratory masks, in particular those for close sealing conformity with the 
face or visage contours of the human form. As such, the masks provide a controlled respiratory or breathing environment adjacent 
the oral and nasal respiratory tracts and organs - and one admitting respiratory gases 
at a required composition, pressure and flow rate. Accordingly, seal performance is crucial to overall mask performance. In respiratory mask technology, aviation masks are subject to particularly rigorous 
operational conditions and yet the required performance standards are also onerous 
and tightly specified - not least since the life of an aviator, in particular a pilot, and 
consequently the safety and fate of an aircraft and crew may ultimately depend on their 
being met. Military aviation imposes especially stringent demands, since - in providing and 
maintaining a controlled breathing environment - the mask must inhibit - indeed 
ultimately prohibit altogether - the ingress of hazardous or contaminated ambient 
gases, such as those associated with the deployment into the atmosphere of chemical 
and biological (CB) weaponry.  Operationally, respiratory masks for aviation use are subject to a differential pressure, 
which may in certain (extreme) circumstances undermine the mechanical seal action 
and thus the overall dynamic sealing effectiveness. Thus, at great altitude, the ambient pressure is low and this is reflected in a prevailing 
cockpit pressure in a non-pressurised aircraft. In such conditions the atmosphere is 
also characteristically 'thin' - ie of low density - and thus a supplementary respiratory 
supply must be provided to maintain normal pilot breathing. A supplementary supply is typically regulated by a control valve and available on-demand 
through an alternate inspiratory/expiratory-exhalation valve arrangement. An additional problem arises with the mechanical forces applied to the mask in severe 
or sudden high-speed aircraft manoeuvres. Specifically, accelerative or so-called 'g-loads' 
may increase the effective weight of the mask by several times (say 2/3 to 8/9 
g). Typically, the mask is of not insignificant mass and bulk and thus inertia and so tends 
to reflect such 'g' loads in a perceptible manner, both in terms of seal contact 
performance and user comfort. For example, under extreme negative 'g' loads, the mask and attendant peripheral face 
seal may tend to move away from the

A seal element for a respiratory mask (20) comprising 
a resiliently deformable substrate (22) - for example a rubber mass - 

pre-configured to follow generally a desired surface contact profile - such as the visage 
or face (30) of a wearer - 

a stiffening element (23) embedded within, or bonded to one or more sides of the 
substrate 

the stiffening element incorporating a plurality of flexible or sprung finger elements (24) 
mounted upon one or more base elements (34) 

the fingers extending transversely across the seal boundary or periphery 

and disposed - when the mask is initially mounted - to bias the underlying resilient 
substrate into intimate sealing contact - ie with the wearer's face contours - 

and similarly to allow intervening elements of resilient substrate to move independently 
into sealing contact 

whereby to maintain/preserve seal performance under varying g-loads and pressure 
 

differentials across the mask, without the necessity for varying independently the mask 
mounting tension. 
A respiratory mask seal, as claimed in Claim 1, configured as a closed loop with a 
succession of inwardly directed spring tensioner fingers integrated at their 

corresponding outer ends in a continuous peripheral ring at the seal periphery. 
A respiratory mask seal, as claimed in Claim 2, incorporating a plurality of differently 
profiled stiffening fingers - eg varying from short and slender on the one hand to long 

and broad on the other hand - to provide localised adaptation of seal conformity. 
A respiratory mask seal, as claimed in any of the preceding claims, and of generally 
triangular profile in contact area plan, with rounded comers, to embrace at one apex 

a wearer's nose region and at the opposite side a wearer's mouth region. 
A respiratory mask incorporating a mask seal as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims. 
A respiratory mask, as claimed in Claim 5, incorporating a lightweight, rigid or semi-rigid 
shell - for example of glass or carbon-reinforced synthetic plastics material - 

forming a breathing chamber, for disposition externally around a wearer's nose and 
mouth regions, of generally pyramid shaped profile, upon a triangular base periphery 

defining the seal contact region.
