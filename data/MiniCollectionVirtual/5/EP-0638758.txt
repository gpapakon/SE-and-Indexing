<ABSTRACT>
In order to reinforce sheet-metal profiles, use is made of double beads (4), which each comprise two parallel beads (5, 6). The two beads (5, 6) are deformed from the plane of the sheet metal in opposite directions. The two beads (5, 6) merge directly one into the other at a transition region (7) which rises from one bead (5) to the other bead (6). The double beads (4), which are configured, for example, in the form of an S in cross-section, may be arranged as longitudinal beads and/or transverse beads. They provide considerable reinforcement for the sheet metal profile.

<CLAIMS>
Sheet metal profile having essentially flat profile walls (1, 2) with beads
(5, 6; 5', 6') formed in opposite directions out of the flat sheet,

characterised in that two individual beads (5, 6; 5', 6') formed in
opposite directions out of the flat sheet, form a double bead (4, 4') and

that one bead (5, 5') blends into the other bead (6, 6') directly in a
transition section (7, 7') which rises towards the other side.
Sheet metal profile according to claim 1, characterised in that the
double bead (4, 4'), runs in a longitudinal direction of an oblong sheet

metal profile in a flat area of the profile.
Sheet metal profile according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
double bead (4) has a cross-section that is almost S-shaped.
Sheet metal profile according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
double bead (4') has a cross-section that is almost Z-shaped.
Sheet metal profile according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
several double beads (4, 4') run in the longitudinal direction of the

sheet metal profile.
Sheet metal profile according to any of the claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that several double beads (4, 4') run in a transverse direction of the

sheet metal profile.
Sheet metal profile according to claim 6, having profile walls that are
bent at an angle to each other, characterised in that the double beads

(4, 4') running in a transverse direction, are taken round the profile
edges (8) formed between adjacent profile walls (1, 2). 
Sheet metal profile according to claim 7, characterised in that the

transverse beads (4) comprise bead sections which are flush with one
another and run at a distance apart.
Sheet metal profile according to claim 8, characterised in that a flush
bead section is connected at intervals to a bead section running

around a profile edge (8).
Sheet metal profile according to claim 1 in the form of a U-section rail
or C-section rail, characterised in that double beads (4, 4') are

provided as longitudinal or transverse beads.
Sheet metal profile according to claim 1 in the form of a U-shaped
cross connector with two U-arms connected by a web centre piece, for

connecting profile rails, characterised in that at least two double beads
(4, 4') run through from one U-arm (13) to the second U-arm (13) via

the web centre piece (12).
Sheet metal profile according to claim 1, in the form of a hanger for
suspended ceilings and the like, characterised in that two vertical

double beads (4) are arranged at a distance apart in a vertical surface
(15) of the hanger.
