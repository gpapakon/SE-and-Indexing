<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to coating compositions used for forming a 
magnetic layer on the surface of substrates to prepare magnetic recording 

media, e.g., recording tapes, of which the characteristic ingredient is a 
copolymeric resin. The copolymeric resin is a copolymer obtained by the 

copolymerization of comonomers in a specified proportion including (1) vinyl 
chloride, (2) vinyl acetate, and (3) an acrylate or methacrylate moiety 

having a sulfonic acid group or a metal or amine salt thereof. This 
copolymeric resin is advantageous in respect of imparting enhanced 

dispersion and magnetic property characteristics while also having 
desirable rheological characteristics and thermal stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coating compositions used for forming
a magnetic layer on magnetic recording media, in particular to
resins used as binder ingredients in the coating compositions capable
of uniformly dispersing and suitable for binding particles of
ferromagnetic materials and to magnetic recording media carrying these coating compositions.Over the years, magnetic recording has come to occupy a vital
place in a myriad of industries. Magnetic tape is accordingly utilized
for audio, video, computer, instrumentation and other recordings.
Magnetic recording media are utilized in a variety of forms,
including, for example, magnetic cards and disks, reels, video tapes,
high performance audio tapes, computer tapes, floppy disks and the
like.While there are several different types of magnetic recording
media, most types consist of a layer of magnetic particles, sometimes
referred to as "pigment", coated on a plastic, paper or metal base.
Information to be recorded is stored in the magnetic pigment applied
to the base as a series of small domains magnetized by a recording
head. The coating layer of the magnetic pigment includes a binder
system which provides a cohesive matrix between the magnetic
pigment particles and adheres such particles to the base.The magnetic coating is applied to the base by coating
equipment such as, for example, a gravure roll coater, and the coated
base then typically immediately proceeds to a magnetic orientation
step wherein orientation of the pigment particles is effected on the
undried layer. In this step, the long axis of the pigment particles,
typically acicular crystals, is made to coincide with the magnetization
direction. In order to achieve good recording performance, the magnetic
coating must possess a wide variety of characteristics. Pigment
particles, desirably of relatively uniform particle size, should form as
high a proportion of the coating layer as possible. Further, the degree
of dispersion of the pigment particles in the coating, often evaluated
as degree of gloss, should be as high as possible. Further, the highly
dispersed pigment particles must be capable of being adequately
oriented as previously described (the degree of orientation often
measured as "squareness").Still further, the adhesion and wear resistance of the magnetic
coating or film should be high. Also, the coefficient of friction of the
magnetic surface should be low against the head material, and yet
have an adequate value against the driving media such as pitch
rollers and capstan
