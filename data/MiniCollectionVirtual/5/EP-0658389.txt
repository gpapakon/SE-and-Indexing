<ABSTRACT>
A gang saw is described which consists of a saw frame (1) going up and down and having parallel saw blades (2) and of a feed device for the block-like material (3) to be cut, which is held in a straight guide. In this arrangement, a blowing device (10) for an airblast flow directed inside the kerfs (8) as flow passages at an acute angle ( alpha ) towards the back of the saw blades (2) is provided on the rear side of the saw frame (1) in the feed direction of the material (3) to be cut. The blowing device (10) has a blowing head (11) which adjoins the material (3) to be cut and forms a discharge passage (12) extending right above the width of the material to be cut and inclined at an acute angle ( alpha ) relative to the saw frame (1). The airblast flow of the blowing device (10) is directed in the direction of the working stroke of the saw frame (1) against the saw blades (2). The blowing device (10) is attached to a dosing device for a lubricant.
