<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an optical device for a vehicle, in particular a rear vehicle light which has an air-tight hollow space (12) formed by walls. The walls can be constructed here as an optical disc which are designed to correspond to their purpose and are equipped with optical means. A one-way valve is inserted into one of these walls and when there is overpressure in the hollow space (12) it connects this hollow space (12) briefly to the ambient atmosphere in order to compensate pressure. The one-way valve is formed by an opening in one of the walls, the mouth of which opening is widened at the outside of the wall. A rubber-elastic, plug-like valve body (16) whose shaft is narrower than the opening is positioned in the wall. The valve body (16) engages with a formed-on shoulder behind the edge of the opening on the inside of the wall, and on the outside of the wall the valve body (16) rests in a sealing fashion with a sealing lip which is formed onto the edge of a circumferential collar.
