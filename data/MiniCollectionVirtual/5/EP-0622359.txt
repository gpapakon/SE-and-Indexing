<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates
to quinoxaline
compounds, liquid crystal compositions containing them
with improved responsiveness to an electric
field, a liquid crystal device using the compositions
for use in a display device, a liquid crystal-optical
shutter, etc., a display apparatus using the device,
and a display method of using the composition or
device.Hitherto, liquid crystal devices have been
used as an electro-optical device in various fields.
Most liquid crystal devices which have been put into
practice use TN (twisted nematic) type liquid
crystals, as shown in "Voltage-Dependent Optical
Activity of a Twisted Nematic Liquid Crystal" by M.
Schadt and W. Helfrich "Applied Physics Letters" Vol.
18, No. 4 (Feb. 15, 1971) pp. 127-128.These devices are based on the dielectric
alignment effect of a liquid crystal and utilize an 
effect that the average molecular axis direction is
directed to a specific direction in response to an
applied electric field because of the dielectric
anisotropy of liquid crystal molecules. It is said
that the limit of response speed is on the order of
µsec, which is too slow for many uses. On the other
hand, a simple matrix system of driving is most
promising for application to a large-area flat display
in view of cost, productivity, etc., in combination.
In the simple matrix system, an electrode arrangement
wherein scanning electrodes and signal electrodes are
arranged in a matrix, and for driving, a multiplex
driving scheme is adopted wherein an address signal is
sequentially, periodically and selectively applied to
the scanning electrodes and prescribed data signals
are selectively applied in parallel to the signal
electrodes in synchronism with the address signal.When the above-mentioned TN-type liquid
crystal is used in a device of such a driving system,
a certain electric field is applied to regions where a
scanning electrode is selected and signal electrodes
are not selected (or regions where a scanning
electrode is not selected and a signal electrode is
selected), which regions are called "half-selected
points". If the difference between a voltage applied
to the selected points and a voltage applied to the
half-selected points is sufficiently large, and a 
voltage threshold level required for allowing liquid
crystal molecules to be aligned or oriented
perpendicular to an electric field is set to a value
therebetween, display devices normally operate.
However, in fact, as the number (N) of scanning lines
increases, a time (duty ratio) during which an
