<ABSTRACT>
For a large system having an associated monitoring system with one or more user
interfaces that each requires a large amount of direct user interaction, a liaison interface

is provided between the user and the existing user interfaces. The liaison interface
requires much less direct user interaction by taking the place of the user in the extensive

direct interaction required by the existing user interfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed toward a technology for providing a liaison interface
between a user and an existing user interface, and more particularly to such a liaison
interface where the existing user interface normally requires an extensive amount of
direct user interaction, and where the liaison interface isolates the user from the existing
user interface by taking the place of the user in the extensive direct interaction with the
existing user interface in order to reduce the amount of direct interaction required of the
user.Large systems often include monitoring systems that permit one or more users to
monitor the performance of the system in general, and to specifically monitor the state of
one or more parameters of the large system. In some instances, the manner in which the
monitoring system delivers information to the user can be a burden.An example of the large system discussed above is a wireless communication
network. Lucent Technologies Inc. has developed a monitoring system that a user can
use to change parameters of the large system as well as to extract data about the large
system. This monitoring system can generate the TIpdunix (TI) interface, the Status
Display Page (SDP) interface and/or the AUTOPLEX Recent Change & Verification
Database (APXRCV) interface. These interfaces can be used individually. But typically,
information extracted from one of the interfaces is used to make a decision to use a
second one of the interfaces in one way or another. To use an interface, a user must
start a discrete process. In a windows-based environment, each interface session has its
own window.These discrete or non-integrated interfaces to the monitoring systems pose
problems for the user. Each interface has its own set of commands as well as formats for
returning information to the user. These command sets and display formats are 
extensive. This burdens the user's memory. Moreover, the SDP interface returns
information in a manner that requires the user to interpret a combination of the
foreground and background colors, as well as whether the associated text is blinking or
not, in a particular region of the screen in order to determine the state of a system
component of a large system.Based upon the information extracted from a first interface, the user must make a
decision about whether it is appropriate to use a second interface and if so, the user must
appropriately form the command to be submitted. Often, the first interface is used
merely to verify that the large system is operating

An arrangement of interfaces to a system, the arrangement of interfaces
comprising:


a first interface to said system, said first interface requiring direct user interaction
in order for said user to communicate a first amount of information with said system; and
