<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of manufacturing a laminated 
ceramic capacitor including a step of forming an electrically 

conductive paste layer on a green sheet composed of lead system 
composite perovskite oxide. The method is characterized by that the 

paste includes a solvent in which are distributed metal powder 
including at least silver powder, organic titanium compound, organic 

rhodium compound and organic binder. An amount of titanium in the 
paste preferably is in the range of 0.02 % to 0.09 % by weight on the 

basis of a weight of the metal powder, and an amount of rhodium in the 
paste preferably is in the range of 0.10 % to 0.60 % by weight on the 

basis of a weight of the metal powder

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a 
laminated ceramic capacitor, and more particularly to a method of 
manufacturing such a capacitor using an electrically conductive paste 
used for the formation of an internal electrode of a laminated ceramic 
capacitor which uses lead system composite perovskite oxide as a 
dielectric substance. The laminated ceramic capacitor as aforementioned is 
manufactured generally in the following steps. First, lead system 
composite perovskite oxide powder as a ceramic dielectric substance 
powder is mixed with an organic binder and a solvent, and then the 
mixture is formed into a sheet by means of a casting process. Then, on 
the green sheet are formed electrically conductive paste layers which 
are to work as internal electrodes, by means of a screen printing 
process. After a certain number of the layers have been deposited, 
they are compressed to bond with each other. Then, the thus laminated 
layers is cut into individual capacitors. Then, the individual 
capacitors are fired so that a ceramic dielectric substance and metal 
powder in the paste are simultaneously sintered. Finally, an external 
electrode is formed. As having been explained, a step of simultaneously firing a 
dielectric ceramic in the form of a sheet and metal powder in the 
electrically conductive paste to be sintered is indispensable to a 
method of manufacturing a laminated ceramic capacitor. A laminated ceramic capacitor can have a desired property as 
a capacitor by forming ceramic dielectrics and internal electrodes 
closely integral with each other by means of the above mentioned 
firing step. Accordingly, it is quite important in a firing step to avoid  
 
so-called "delamination of layers", which means a phenomenon that a 
ceramic dielectric is peeled off from an internal electrode in a 
laminated structure after a firing step, in order to obtain the stability 
and reliability of electrical properties as a capacitor. The 
delamination of layers would occur when a stress acting on an 
interface of the metal (internal electrode) and the ceramic (dielectric 
substance) is greater than a bonding strength of them. In view of this 
point, the followings are considered to be problems in a firing step. 
1. A ceramic can have only a weak bonding strength with a metal, 
and hence it is impossible to strongly bond a ceramic to a metal. 2. Since there is a difference in a volume shrinkage due to firing 
between a ceramic and a metal, a stress would be generated at an 
interface of them
