<ABSTRACT>
According to this process: air is distilled in a distillation apparatus (13) associated with a heat-exchange line (11) through which a heat-generating fluid is circulated under high pressure; a store (23) is fed, at least intermittently, with gas in liquid form; and gas in liquid form withdrawn from the store is brought to a vapourisation pressure, and it is vapourised under this pressure in the heat-exchange line (11). Application to supplying oxygen, nitrogen and argon under pressure to stainless steel production installations such as electric arc furnaces associated with an AOD process.

Process for supplying a gas under pressure which is
liquefiable at a cryogenic temperature under this pressure,

to a plant (1) consuming at least one constituent of the
air, wherein :


air is distilled in a distillation apparatus (13)
comprising at least one column associated with a heat

exchange line (11) in which a single heating fluid is
circulated, consisting of air to be distilled, under a high

pressure appreciably greater than the operating pressure of
the distillation apparatus;
a storage vessel (23; 20) is supplied, outside any
column of the apparatus, at least intermittently, with the

said gas in liquid form; and
at least part of the said gas under pressure is
produced by bringing the gas in liquid form withdrawn from

the said storage vessel to a vaporization pressure greater
than its storage pressure, and is vaporized at this

vaporization pressure in the heat exchange line (11)
associated with the distillation apparatus by condensing

part of the air under the high pressure;
the storage vessel (23; 20) is supplied at least
partially from an external source (29; 34) which is not a

column of the apparatus;
the gas in liquid form is conveyed from the storage
vessel to the heat exchange line without passing through a

column of the apparatus;
all the air which was condensed under the high
pressure while vaporizing the gas in liquid form is

conveyed to the distillation apparatus, 
and the heat for vaporizing/reheating the said gas
is at least partially recovered by producing an additional

flow of liquid oxygen and/or liquid nitrogen withdrawn from
the column of the apparatus.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that at
least one constituent of air is simultaneously produced

under pressure by bringing this constituent in liquid form
withdrawn from the distillation apparatus (13) to a

vaporization pressure greater than the pressure at which it

is withdrawn and by vaporizing this liquid under this
vaporization pressure in the heat exchange line (11).
Process according to either of claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the said gas is a gas from the air of

which the flow rate is greater than the flow rate of this
gas produced at the same time by the distillation apparatus

(13).
Process according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the said vaporization is carried out

in a continuous manner.
Process according to claim 3, characterized in that
gas in liquid form is conveyed from the distillation

apparatus (13) to the storage vessel (20) during certain
periods, and the said vaporization is carried out during

other periods.
