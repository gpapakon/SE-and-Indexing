<ABSTRACT>
A device for preventing the opening of a door (1) by brute 
force comprises two blocks (4,5) to be mounted opposite one 

another on the door (1) and door frame (2). The block (4) on the door 
having a concave face (4a,b) matching a convex face (5a,5b) on the block 

(5) on the door frame. The door may be swung open normally 
but lateral displacement of the door out of the frame is 

limited by the blocks. Interlocking teeth may be provided 
on the blocks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to security devices for 
doors and in particular elements for reinforcing the hinge 
side of a door. Although there are many devices for strengthening the lock 
side of doors and preventing any bolt being forced there 
still exists a need for a cheap and effective means for 
reinforcing the hinge side of a door. Frequently, the 
hinges provided on doors are not very strong and entry may 
be gained by breaking the hinges more easily than forcing 
the lock. One existing device comprises a number of metal 
studs to be attached to the edge of the door or to the 
door frame. When the door is closed the studs enter 
corresponding holes in the other of the frame or door and 
prevent the door being forced at the hinge side. This 
device, however, suffers from the drawback that it is 
necessary to provide quite deep holes in either the door 
or frame which is not possible where the door and frame 
are manufactured from extruded synthetic resin. According to the present invention there is provided the 
combination of a hinged door and frame, having top and 
bottom first members mounted respectively onthe top and 
bottom surfaces of the door at the hinge side thereof, and 
each having a first concave engaging surface; and top and 
bottom second members mounted on the door frame and each 
having a second convex engaging surface so that, when the 
door is closed, the first and second engaging surfaces are 
in an adjacent opposed relationship, said engaging 
surfaces being shaped so as to allow rotation of the door 
about the hinge but restrict displacement of the hinge 
side of the door from the plane of the frame and vertical 
displacement of the door.  The term "door" as used herein is intended to encompass 
any form of hinged covering for an aperture, e.g. a hatch, 
window etc. Preferably, the first and second engaging sections are 
respectively concave and convex, most preferably each 
being formed from two or more flat surfaces. When the 
door is closed the first and second members are close 
together with the engaging surfaces in an opposing 
relationship. The surfaces are shaped so that they slide 
past one another as the door is rotated on its hinge but 
displacement of the door out of the plane of the frame or 
vertically within it will cause the two engaging surfaces 
to contact so that the load on the door is borne by the 
two parts of the device rather than the hinge. The first and second members are preferably blocks 
provided with projections to engage slots provided on

<CLAIMS>
The combination of a hinged door and frame, having 
top and bottom first members mounted respectively onthe 

top and bottom surfaces of the door at the hinge side 
thereof, and each having a first concave engaging surface; 

and top and bottom second members mounted on the door 
frame and each having a second convex engaging surface so 

that, when the door is closed, the first and second 
engaging surfaces are in an adjacent opposed relationship, 

said engaging surfaces being shaped so as to allow 
rotation of the door about the hinge but restrict 

displacement of the hinge side of the door from the plane 
of the frame and vertical displacement of the door. 
A combination according to claim 1, wherein the 
engaging surfaces each comprise at least two flat faces. 
A combination according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
first and second members are provided with interlocking 

teeth on the engaging surfaces. 
A combination according to claim 3 wherein at least 
some of said teeth are elongate in a direction generally 

parallel to the axis of the hinge of the door. 
A combination according to claim 3 or 4, wherein at 
least some of said teeth are elongate in a direction 

generally perpendicular to the axis of the hinge of the 
door. 
A combination according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the two members are connected together by a 

tether. 
A combination according to claim 6 wherein said 
 

tether comprises a length of steel cord. 
A combination according to any one of the preceding 
claims further comprising fixing means to fix said first 

and second members to a door and a door frame 
respectively, said fixing means comprising at least one 

projection shaped to engage a slot provided in the door or 
door frame. 
A combination according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein said first and second members are diecast 

in zinc. 
A combination according to any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the door and door frame are integrally 

formed with said first and second members respectively.
