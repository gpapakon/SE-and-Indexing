<ABSTRACT>
A heated injection molding nozzle (12) having a melt 
channel (70) which branches outwardly to several spaced edge 

gates (78). The nozzle has alternate thermocouple element (94) 
receiving bores (88,90) spaced longitudinally along a temperature 

gradient extending between the heating element (42) and the 
front end (38) of the nozzle. The nozzle facilitates the 

temperature control of materials having different thermal 
characteristics. When molding an amorphous material, a 

temperature somewhat lower than the prescribed operating 
temperature is desirable so the thermocouple element (94) is 

mounted in the rearward bore (88) closer to the heating element (42). 
If it is critical to maintain the temperature of the melt 

near the prescribed operating temperature for a material 
such as a crystalline material, the thermocouple element (94) is 

received in the forward bore (90) further along the temperature 
gradient from the heating element (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to injection 
molding and more particularly to a heated nozzle for edge 
gating having alternate bores to receive a thermocouple 
element to monitor the operating temperature. It is well known to monitor the operating 
temperature by mounting a thermocouple element in a bore 
extending inwardly near the front end of a heated nozzle. 
Examples are shown in the applicants' U.S. Patent Numbers 
4,768,283 which issued September 6, 1988, 4,981,431 which 
issued January 1, 1991, and the applicants' Canadian Patent 
Application Serial number 2,101,480 filed July 28, 1993 
entitled "Injection Molding Nozzle which Retains a 
Thermocouple Element." U.S. Patent Number 4,981,431 
on which the preamble of claim 1 is based 
shows 
an edge gated configuration with the thermocouple element  
 
bore extending inwardly between the front end of the 
heating element and the seals extending to the gates. 
While these previous configurations are satisfactory for 
many applications, there is a problem that there is a 
temperature gradient near the front end of the nozzle due 
to heat loss to the surrounding cooled mold. This is 
particularly true for edge gating where the front end of 
the heating element must be spaced far enough from the 
front end of the nozzle to leave room for the outwardly 
extending seals. Thus, the accuracy of the measurement of 
the operating temperature is very dependent upon where the 
thermocouple element receiving bore is located between the 
heating element and the front end of the nozzle. The 
temperature measured by the thermocouple element relative 
to a temperature setpoint determines how much heat is 
provided by the heating elements. Thus, erroneous 
measurement of the operating temperature results in various 
problems dependent upon the type of material or melt being 
processed. For instance, if a crystalline material with a 
narrow temperature window or span between the melting point 
and processing temperature is being processed and the 
thermocouple element receiving bore is very close to the 
heating element, the temperature setpoint has to be well 
above the operating temperature prescribed for the material 
to provide sufficient heat to avoid the melt in the melt  
 
passage near the gates dropping below the solidification 
temperature. Conversely, if an amorphous material is being 
processed and the thermocouple element receiving bore is 
closer to the front end of the nozzle, the temperature 
setpoint can be well below the operating temperature 
pre
