<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a thin-film magnetic
head comprising a magnetoresistive element and at least one flux guide, which method
starts from a support.Methods of manufacturing thin-film magnetic heads are known, inter alia
from EP-A 0 516 022 (herewith incorporated by reference). The magnetic heads
obtained by means of the methods described in EP-A 0 516-022 are integrated magnetic
heads having a contact face and comprising an inductive part and a magnetoresistive
part.In accordance with a first method known from EP-A 0 516 022 a first
structured insulation layer of SiO2 is formed on a magnetic substrate of a ferrite by
means of a lithographic method, which layer is subsequently provided with a layer of
Au for forming a write coil. Subsequently, a second structured insulation layer is
provided on which a core layer of an amorphous material based on Co is deposited.
This core layer is in contact with the magnetic substrate via apertures in the insulation
layers. The parts of the second insulation layer not coated by the core layer are filled up
by means of a filling layer of Al2O3. After the filling layer has been formed, the core
layer and the filling layer are planed by means of lapping. A third structured insulation
layer of SiO2 is deposited on the surface thus obtained on which subsequently a bias
winding of Au is formed. A fourth structured insulation layer of SiO2 is provided on
this winding. Subsequently, a magnetoresistive element of permalloy is formed on this
insulation layer. Then a fifth structured insulation layer of SiO2 is provided and
subsequently a yoke of an amorphous material which is based on Co and is in contact
with the core layer via apertures in the three last-mentioned insulation layers.In accordance with a second method known from EP-A 0 516 022 two
flux guides of a Co-based amorphous material are provided on a non-magnetic
substrate, while an aperture between the two flux guides is filled with a first insulation
layer of SiO2. The surface formed by the flux guides and the first insulation layer is 
provided with a second structured insulation layer on which subsequently a
magnetoresistive (MR) element is formed. The MR element is then coated with a third
structured insulation layer on which subsequently a bias winding is formed. A fourth
structured insulation layer is provided for the purpose of coating the bias winding.
Subsequently a magnetic core layer of a Co-based material is formed which is in contact
with one of the flux guides via apertures
