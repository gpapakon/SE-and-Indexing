<ABSTRACT>
A diaphragm (60) for a brake booster (10) having an annular inner bead (62) with first and second radial surfaces (86, 70) separated by an apex (82). The second radial surface (86) has a plurality of indentations (80) that extend from the apex. In response to a positive pressure differential created by vacuum in a first chamber (28) and air in a second chamber (20), an output force is developed to effect a brake application corresponding to an input force. This positive pressure differential acts on the annular bead to urge said first radial face into engagement with a wall to prevent communication between the first and second chambers during a brake application. In the absence of the presence of vacuum in the first chamber, the input force acts on the wall to develop an operational pressure in the first chamber to develop a negative pressure differential between the first and second chambers. This negative pressure differential acts on the diaphragm to rotate the annular inner bead about the apex to move the first radial face away from the wall and allow communication between the first and second chambers through the indentations to attenuate the negative pressure differential and allow an input force to effect the brake application.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vacuum brake booster with an improved diaphragm. More particularly, the invention relates to a vacuum brake booster of the type defined 
by a front shell and a rear shell with a wall member having a diaphragm which separates a first 
chamber from a second chamber, the diaphragm having a peripherial bead retained by flanges 
on the front shell and the rear shell, and an annular central bead located in a groove of the wall 
member, the wall member responding to a first pressure differential resulting from a relatively 
low pressure in the first chamber and a relatively high pressure in the second chamber to 
provide an output member with a force in response to an input force for effecting a brake 
application, the input force in the absence of the relatively low pressure in the first chamber 
moving the wall member to develop an operational pressure in the first chamber, the 
operational pressure being higher than the relatively high pressure and creating a second 
pressure differential between the first chamber and second chamber, the vacuum brake booster 
further comprising communication means for establishing a selective communication between 
the first and second chambers to attenuate the second pressure differential, the annular central 
bead comprising a first radial face, an annular apex and a second radial face, and the first 
pressure differential acting on the diaphragm to move the first radial face into engagement 
with the wall member to prevent communication between the first and second chambers. A vacuum brake booster of this type is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,495,854. According to this prior patent, the selective communication means include a 
communication bore which is located in a diaphragm supporting plate coupled to the wall 
member. This solution cannot be considered as fully satisfactory. Indeed, if , on the one hand, the communication bore is a relatively small, the 
attenuation of the second pressure differential is necessarily relatively low, which does not 
allow to increase the braking efficiency. But if, on the other hand, the communication bore is a relatively large, or if many 
communication bores are provided, the rigidity of the diaphragm supporting plate is affected, 
and a material failure may occur.  
 In this context, it is an object of the invention to provide a vacuum brake booster in 
which the second pressure differential may be efficiently attenuated without the previously 
mentioned limitations and drawbacks. To this purpose, the vacuum

a wall member (22) having a diaphragm (60) which separates a first chamber (18) from a 

second chamber (20), said diaphragm (60) having a peripherial bead (64) retained by flanges 
on the front shell (12) and the rear shell (14) and an annular central bead (62) located in a 

groove (27) of the wall member (22), said wall member (22) responding to a first pressure 
differential resulting from a relatively low pressure in said first chamber (18) and a relatively 

high pressure in said second chamber (20) to provide an output member (56) with a force in 
response to an input force for effecting a brake application, said input force in the absence of 

said relatively low pressure in said first chamber (18) moving said wall member (22) to 
develop an operational pressure in said first chamber (18), said operational pressure being 

higher than said relatively high pressure and creating a second pressure differential between 
said first chamber (18) and second chamber (20), said vacuum brake booster including 

communication means for establishing a selective communication between said first and 
second chambers to attenuate said second pressure differential, said annular central bead (62) 

comprising a first radial face (90), an annular apex (82) and a second radial face (86), and said 
first pressure differential acting on said diaphragm (60) to move said first radial face (90) into 

engagement with said wall member (22) to prevent communication between said first (18) and 
second (20) chambers, characterized in that said communication means comprise a plurality of 

indentations (80,80'...80N) formed on said second radial face (86) of said annular central bead 
(62) and extending to the center of said annular apex (82), said operational pressure acting on 

said diaphragm (22) to rotate said annular central bead (62) about said annular apex (82) and 
allow communication of air between said first chamber (18) and said second chamber (20) 

through said plurality of indentations (80,80'...80n) to attenuate said second pressure 
differential. 
The vacuum brake booster (10) as recited in claim 1, characterized in that each of 
said plurality of indentations (80,80'...80n) in said second radial face (86) uniformly expand 

from said apex (82) to provide for smooth flow of air toward said second chamber (20). 
The vacuum brake booster (10) as recited in claim 2, characterized in that said 
plurality of indentations (80,80'...80N) are uniformly spaced on said second radial face (86).  

 
The vacuum brake booster (10) as recited in claim 3, characterized in that said 
plurality of indentations (80,80'...80n) are in the form of scallops to reduce the introduction of 

areas of stress concentrations in said annular central bead (62).
