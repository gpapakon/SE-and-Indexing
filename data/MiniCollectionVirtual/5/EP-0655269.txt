<ABSTRACT>
A liquid filter (10) for diesel fuel is proposed which, to avoid running problems in a diesel motor vehicle, has a device (26) for dosed breakdown of air. The liquid filter (10) has a coil insert (20) through which flow passes axially and having a central tube (22) in the interior of which is arranged a gas-trapping bell (26) at the bottom, open end (29) of which the fuel stream, as a result of the flow deflection, separates off relatively large air bubbles. In the closed, top end (28) of the gas-trapping bell (26) the separated air collects in a gas collection space (27) from which, via a small throttle borehole (38), a dosed air breakdown is performed using small air bubbles which can be processed by the injection system without interfering with running.

Liquid filter for fuel, especially diesel fuel, 
with a housing which, in addition to an inlet for the 

fuel, has an outlet situated at the top in the housing, 
and with a filter insert which is arranged in the housing 

and extends downwards from the outlet and is arranged in 
such a way that it is inserted between the inlet and the 

outlet into the fuel flow to be cleaned, and with a 
leaktight dividing wall which extends underneath the 

outlet and is arranged downstream of the filter insert, 
on the clean side of the latter, and serves to form a 

gas-collecting space which is connected to the outlet via 
at least one restrictor opening arranged in the dividing 

wall and serving the purpose of controlled gas discharge 
and in which the dividing wall has, at the bottom, at 

least one opening, past which the fuel flow is guided to 
the outlet, characterized in that the dividing wall 

arranged below the outlet (17) is designed as a gas-collecting 
bell (26), the closed end (28) of which lies 

at the top and is thus adjacent to the outlet (17), while 
its open end (29), that forming the opening (31), lies at 

the bottom and thus remote from the outlet (17), in that 
the restrictor opening or openings (38), which is 

connected to the gas-collecting space (27), is/are 
arranged in the region of the upper end (28) of the gas-collecting 

bell (26), in that the fuel flow in the region 
of the bottom opening (31) of the gas-collecting bell 

(26) undergoes a deflection which assists the elimination 
of the gas and then is guided around the outside of the 

gas-collecting bell (26) to the outlet (17).  
 
Liquid filter according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the filter insert (19) is designed as an axial-flow 

wound element (20) with a central tube (22) and in 
that the gas-collecting bell (26) is arranged in the 

central tube (22). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the gas-collecting bell (26) extends 

essentially over the entire axial length of the wound 
element (20). 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the filter insert (19) is supported 

in the housing (13) on a supporting disc (21) which has 
a central passage (37) serving for the passage of the 

fuel flow and in that the gas-collecting bell (26) is 
placed with its open end (29) over this passage (37). 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the gas-collecting bell (26) is 

designed essentially as a hollow-cylindrical tubular part 
(32) with a cover part (33) which provides a leaktight 

closure, the tubular part (32) forming, with the central 
tube (22), a flow channel (34) of annular cross-section, 

the diameter of which is larger than that of the passage 
(37) in the supporting disc (21). 
Liquid filter according to one or more of Claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the gas-collecting bell 

(26) is of one-piece design and is supported axially 
within the housing (13), in particular between the 

housing cover (11) and the supporting disc (21). 
Liquid filter according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the gas-collecting bell (26) has apertures (35) 

situated at the open end (29) and, at its closed end 
(28), has supporting ribs (39) which serve the purpose of 

spacing. 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the gas-collecting bell (26) is 

composed of plastic. 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 4 to 8, 
characterized in that the passage (37) is formed as a 

nozzle by a projecting collar (51).  
 
Liquid filter according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the gas-collecting bell and the 

central tube are of one-piece design.
