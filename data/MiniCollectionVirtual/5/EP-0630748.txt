<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording head for ejecting ink drops by expanding 
or shrinking a pressure generation chamber (52) of an ink 

flow route forming member (6) consisting of nozzle openings 
(2), the pressure generation chamber (52), an ink supply port 

(54), and a reservoir (53). Piezoelectric vibrators (46) are 
disposed and fixed in a row with a predetermined pitch, to a 

piezoelectric vibrator support plate (44) having excellent 
cutting properties and the piezoelectric vibrator support 

plate (44) is fixed to a base (45) made of material having a 
larger rigidity than the support plate (44). If the 

piezoelectric vibrator support plate (44) receives reaction 
forces when ink is ejected, the base (45) having a larger 

rigidity than the support plate (44) resists the reaction 
force and suppresses undesired displacement of the 

contiguous piezoelectric vibrators.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ink jet recording head.An ink jet recording head using piezoelectric vibrators having a nozzle plate formed with nozzle openings, a spacer for separating a pressure generation chamber, an ink supply port, a reservoir, and a vibration plate deformed by the piezoelectric vibrators to expand or shrink the pressure generation chamber is well known. The piezoelectric vibrators are oscillated based on a print signal to shrink or expand the pressure generation chamber, and thereby suck ink into the pressure generation chamber and eject ink drops therefrom consecutively (see e.g. EP-A-0 443 628).In such an ink jet recording head, the area where piezoelectric vibrators abut a vibration plate can be made extremely small by using piezoelectric vibrators in a vertical vibration mode formed by laminating electrode material and piezoelectric material, with such a construction, a recording head having a resolution of 180 dpi or more can be provided.A piezoelectric vibrator unit having piezoelectric vibrators each being, for example, 5 mm long, 70 Âµm wide, and 0.5 mm thick disposed on a piezoelectric vibrator support plate with a 0.14-mm pitch is used in such a high resolution recording head. To manufacture the piezoelectric vibrator units, a piezoelectric vibration plate formed by laminating alternate layers of piezoelectric material and electrode material and sintering them is formed with electrodes on one surface and cut like strips with a dicing saw, a wire saw, or the like with a predetermined pitch, such as 0.14 mm, with one end of the electrode face fixed to a base in a cantilever fashion.Since the electrodes formed on the base must be separated for each piezoelectric vibrator the cut depth must extend at least to the piezoelectric vibrator support plate. Thus, material having excellent cutting properties, such as glass or piezoelectric material, is used for the piezoelectric vibrator support plate to avoid added resistance to cutting when the piezoelectric vibration plate is cut, thereby preventing the piezoelectric vibrators from being broken or imperfectly formed.According to this method, cutter vibration and shock can be prevented and the manufacturing yield of the vibrator units can be improved. On the other hand, materials having excellent cutting properties are low in rigidity. Thus when such devices receive a reaction force of the piezoelectric vibrators to which a drive signal is applied for jetting ink drops, they are easily distorted and the piezoelectric vibrators located
