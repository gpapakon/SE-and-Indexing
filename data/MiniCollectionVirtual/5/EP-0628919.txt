<ABSTRACT>
A system comprising a user interface which can access downloaded 
electronic shopping information, which can be continually updated and provided either 

"over the air", over cable or satellite transmission paths or other "fast data" paths, and 
automatically correlate this information with the preferences of the user, to create and 

display at least one personalized shopping information database based upon the results 
of the correlation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The application relates to an improved interface system which accesses a
downloaded information database, which can be continually updated, and which is
provided either "over the air", over cable or satellite transmission, or other "fast data"
path, and which automatically correlates the information provided thereby with the
electronic shopping preferences of the user, to create at least one further program
information database based upon the results of the correlation.U.S. Patent No. 4,047,867 describes an interface for a TV-VCR system
which enabled the user to enter information concerning the user's favourite television
programs as well as information about programs stored on video tape. Such information
can include program name, broadcast channel, starting time, length, repeat pattern and
whether the user wanted the program recorded. The patent further describes an interface
system in which such information could be provided in an intuitive and easy manner
through the television receiver's PIP display.Television systems utilizing downloadable information databases have
been described, for example, by Insight Telecast, Inc. and in U.S. Patent Nos.
4,751,578; 4,706,121 and 4,977,455.
Using these systems, TV program information can be downloaded and stored in a
memory and used by a processor to control a programmable TV tuner. U.S. patent No.
5,093,718 describes a system which can provide such information, including graphics
and interactive options, over a "fast data" path which can be a cable, fibre optic or
satellite system. Interactive, or "two way" television systems permitting viewer
responses to video programming, are described for example, in U.S. Patents 5,101,267
and 4,591,906. Integrated data services
networks (IDSN) and bi-directional cable systems can also provide this interactivity and
have been extensively discussed in the literature. In the December, 1986 issue of "Communications of the ACM" (Vol.
29, No. 12, pp. 1229-1239), in an article by Stanfill and Kahle entitled "Parallel
Free-Text Search On The Connection Machine System", the method known as "free text
search" is described which details a method in which seed words are located which can
be used to correlate information provided in one or more portions of text.Home shopping programs are popular features of today's broadcast and
cable television programming. Products are offered for sale by salesmen and orders are
taken from the viewer by telephone. In the near future however, viewers will be able to
electronically "browse" through
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An electronic shopping apparatus (35) for providing a personalized
information database for use in a system (40) comprising means for receiving, storing and

displaying an electronic information database comprising a plurality of summary
records comprising information about items for sale, said apparatus comprising:


means (42) for selecting, and indicating preference or dislike for, first
selected records of said summary records;
means (54) for storing said first selected records together with said indicated
preference or dislike;
means (50) for analyzing said first selected records to isolate first search
information;
means (50) for using said first search information to select second selected
records from said summary records; and
means (56) for storing said second selected records so as to form said
personalized information database.
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said analyzing means comprise means
for performing a free-text search.
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein
said personalized information database represents the

preferences of a consumer with respect to said items for sale.
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said means for storing said second selected
records is removable.
