<ABSTRACT>
Method for separating boric acid from a boric acid 
containing liquid, especially from liquid waste of a 

nuclear power plant, characterised in that the boric acid 
containing liquid is continuously fed in a reactor (1 or 

10) with a non-alkaline environment, and that the boric 
acid is removed by being evaporated by means of steam 

which is first enriched with boric acid and then 
evacuated continuously from the reactor (1 or 10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a method for separating boric
acid from a liquid containing boric acids, especially the
liquid waste of a nuclear power plant, whereby said liquid
is continuously fed in a reactor with a non-alkaline
environment.The primary water of a nuclear power plant of the type
which uses water under pressure comes into direct contact
with the nuclear fuel, and although it is very pure
chemically, it does contain a few GBq of radionuclides
per cubic metre of water. To regulate reactivity, up to
0.25 % of boron is usually added to this water in the
form of boric acid.A fraction of this primary water is then contained in the
waste water. A nuclear power plant produces annually
thousands of cubic meters of slightly radioactive waste
water containing boron which needs to be treated. This
waste water is usually evaporated after a base has been
added. Evaporation is generally considered to be the
method which yields the highest decontamination factor,
i.e. the vapour contains few if any radionuclides, with
the exception of tritium. The remaining concentrates,
which contain about 50% dry residue, are then embedded in
concrete and stored in containers at suitable locations.The high costs for the treatment of the concentrates and
especially for the further storage are proportional to
the volume thereof. For this reason, not only the
decontamination factor, but also the volume reduction factor, i.e.
the ratio between the volume of waste water and the 
volume of concentrate, is very important.Owing to crystallisation problems, the volume reduction
factor during evaporation is likewise limited by the
presence of boron, which constitutes the largest part of
the dry residue in the form of boric acid or borate.
Furthermore, the presence of boric acid may disturb the
embedding of the waste in concrete. For this reason, the
evaporation is carried out in an alkaline environment. DE-A. 3.110.491 discloses also to reduce the volume by evaporation in a
reactor but in a neutral environment in this reactor. The evaporation
is carried out in such manner that the boric acid is concentrated in
the concentrate without precipitation. In a second independent step the
boric acid is precipitated by cooling the concentrate.Although this method allows an important reduction of the volume of the
radioactive waste, this volume reduction is still limited by the boric
acid which remains with the radioactive waste. The removal of boric acid from the waste water would
lead to a higher volume reduction factor,
and thus make it

Method for separating boric acid from a boric acid
containing liquid, especially from liquid waste of a

nuclear power plant, whereby the boric acid
containing liquid is continuously fed in a reactor (1 or

10) with a non-alkaline environment, characterised in that the boric
acid is removed by being evaporated by means of steam

which is first enriched with boric acid and then
evacuated continuously from the reactor (1 or 10).
Method according to the previous claim, characterised
in that the liquid is continuously introduced and in that

the steam, which is enriched with boric acid, is then
continuously removed so that the contents of the reactor

remain virtually constant.
Method according to any of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that the concentrate which remains in

the reactor (1 or 10) is removed discontinuously.
Method according to any of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that the liquid containing boric acid is

added as a solution, and in that the steam is formed at
least largely on location in the reactor (1) by

introducing heat, so that the reactor (1) acts as a
vaporizer.
Method according to the above claim, characterised in
that heat is introduced in the reactor (1) by bringing

steam into the reactor (1). 
Method according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that a concentrate is introduced in the

reactor (10) as liquid containing boron, and in that the
steam for the evaporation of the boric acid is obtained

at least largely from outside the reactor (10), and
introduced continuously from outside the reactor (10)

into the reactor (10), where it is allowed to come into
contact with the concentrate.
Method according to any of the above claims,
characterised in that the temperature and pressure in the

reactor (1 or 10) are kept higher than 100°C and higher

Method according to the above claim, characterised in
that the temperature and pressure in the reactor (1 or

10) are kept between 150 and 180°C and between 5 and 10

Method according to any of the above claims,
characterised in that the boric acid is recovered from

the boric-acid containing vapour which is evacuated from
the reactor (1 or 10).
Method according to the previous claim,
characterised in that the boric acid is recovered by

means of a distillation and fractionating column or a
wash column.
Method according to claims 6 and 9, characterised by
the fact the steam is allowed to flow in a closed loop

(without condensing) over the reactor (10) and a device
(12) to remove the boric acid.
