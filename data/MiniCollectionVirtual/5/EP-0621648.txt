<ABSTRACT>
Metal is deposited on a three-dimensional 
network plastic substrate having internal open 

cells by a gas phase plating technique to form a 
metal layer covering all three-dimensional 

network lattice surface to form a support. An 
active material is carried on the support to 

form an electrode. The electrode is improved in 
active material-support adhesion, allows the 

amounts of conductive agent and binder to be 
reduced, and provides a cell with improved 

performance. It is especially useful in a 
secondary lithium cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrode
having an active material borne on a support
having a three-dimensional network structure
having interconnected spaces, at least the
surface of the three-dimensional network
skeleton being formed of
aluminum. The electrode is useful as a positive
electrode in secondary cells, especially
secondary lithium cells and secondary lithium
ion cells.Positive electrode materials commonly used
in prior art secondary lithium cells and
secondary lithium ion cells include electrode
supports in the form of metal thin plates such
as stainless steel thin plates and aluminum thin
plates, having an active material borne thereon.
Commonly used among the active materials for the
positive electrodes of secondary lithium cells 
are manganese dioxide, cobalt oxide, and
titanium sulfide. Such an active material is
blended with a binder together with an
electrically conductive agent such as graphite
and carbon to form an active material paste
which is coated to a support as mentioned above
to form a positive electrode. The positive
electrode is laid on a lithium base negative
electrode through a separator. The assembly,
optionally after being spirally wound, is impregnated
with a non-aqueous electrolyte solution between
the positive and negative electrodes to
construct a secondary lithium cell.In a secondary lithium ion cell, the
positive electrode is composed of lithium-metal
complex oxide such as LiCoO2 carried on
aluminum sheet and the negative electrode is
composed of graphite carbon carried on copper
sheet.Such secondary lithium cells and secondary
lithium ion cells have been used in practice
although there is a need for further
improvements in repeatable charge-discharge
cycles, discharge electric capacity and electric
power. These cell performance factors can be
increased by improving positive electrode
materials. Prior art positive electrodes have
active materials borne on supports in the form
of thin plates of metals such as stainless steel
and aluminum. All these electrode supports are
not well adherent to active materials such as
manganese dioxide, cobalt oxide, titanium
sulfide and LiCoO2. The active materials are
then susceptible to uneven deterioration,
resulting in less charge-discharge cycle. If
the amounts of the binder and conductive agent
are increased in order to improve adhesion and
conductivity, there is an accompanying lowering
of discharge electric capacity and electric
power. It will then be possible to improve such
factors of secondary lithium cells and secondary
