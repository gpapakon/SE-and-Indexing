<ABSTRACT>
An electronic requisitioning system for channeling customer requisition orders to internal suppliers (109) and outside vendors (106a, 106b), and processing invoices using a centralized computer system (100). A customer accesses an electronic item catalog (126) and requisition form to place an order transmitted to the central computer system. Requisitions are segregated by supplier and sent as purchase orders to appropriate internal suppliers and outside vendors that ship the items directly to the customer. Invoices are centrally processed and the customer receives a combined invoice (130) for all item requisitions and may transmit payment back through to the central computer system.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPUTER INTEGRATION NETWORK FOR CHANNELING CUSTOMER ORDERS THROUGH A CENTRALIZED COMPUTER TO VARIOUS SUPPLIERSFIELD OF INVENTIONThis invention relates to data processing for handling the ordering, order tracking and accounting of supplies. In addition, this invention relates to a centralized computer network for handling customer orders in conjunction with a variety of outside suppliers.BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONFIGURE 1 is a simplified schematic diagram of a typical channel flow system 10 for handling customer orders, delivery of goods, and the accounting for the orders and deliveries in a typical transaction for the ordering of office supplies. The customer 12 completes a hand written order form 14 for several different types of office supplies. This completed order form is forwarded to a central supplier "X" 16.The central supplier processes the customer order by splitting the one completed customer order form into information for individual vendors and prepares several vendor order forms 18, 20, 22, and 24 for the various office supplies that the customer has ordered. For example, the customer may have ordered printer ink that is not stocked by the central supplier. The order for printer ink is placed on another order form and sent by facsimile to an outside vendor such as XYZ office supply 18. 

Similarly, an order for non-stocked business envelopes may be routed to the ABC envelope company 20.The customer requisition orders 14 for supplies that are stocked by the central supplier 16 are entered 21 in the data processing system for that supplier. This data processing system routes the order to the appropriate departments, such as a custom forms warehouse 22 and a stock forms warehouse 24.Each of the outside vendors and departments ships 26 the ordered products directly to the customer 12. The outside vendors submit separate invoices 28 for each completed order to a central invoicing service 30. Similarly, the departments route invoices electronically to the central invoice service via the data processing system for the central supplier. The central invoicing service prepares and submits itemized invoices 32 for all of the delivered products to the customer. The customer submits payment 33 to the central invoicing service which in turn pays the outside vendors and departments for the delivered products.A copy of the customer invoice is also sent to a central customer assistance department 34 of the central supplier 16. This customer assistance department collects data on customer
