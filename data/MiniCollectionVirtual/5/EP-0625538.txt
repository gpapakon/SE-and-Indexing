<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are colored, shaping thermoplastic resin 
pellets prepared by mixing shaping thermoplastic resin 

pellets of polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, ABS 
resin, etc., a powdery colorant and a liquid thermoplastic 

adhesive of ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, nylon, 
water-soluble acrylic polymer, etc. having a water content 

of 5 % by weight or more followed by drying the resulting 
mixture whereby said powdery adhesive is made adhered onto 

the surfaces of said pellets. The colored pellets are 
prepared, using minimized equipments and running costs 

necessary for melting and granulating steps. When mixing 
the powdery colorant and the uncolored shaping 

thermoplastic resin pellets, static electricity is not 
generated. The invention is free from troubles to be 

caused by antistatic agents and organic solvents, not 
needing them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to colored, shaping
thermoplastic resin pellets to be used for obtaining
colored shaped articles of thermoplastic resins, and to a
method for preparing them.In general, as shaping methods for obtaining
colored shaped articles of thermoplastic resins, there are
known 1 ○ a method of feeding shaping thermoplastic resin
pellets containing a powdery colorant into an injection-molding
machine or an extrusion-molding machine, mixing
them in the kneading step in the shaping machine and
shaping the resulting mixture by injection molding or
extrusion molding, 2 ○ a method of gradually adding a
liquid colorant or a master batch colorant to shaping
thermoplastic resin pellets in an injection-molding
machine or an extrusion-molding machine so as to mix and
knead them and shaping the resulting mixture by injection
molding or extrusion molding, and 3 ○ a method of
previously preparing colored, shaping thermoplastic resin 
pellets as an intermediate product and introducing the
colored, shaping thermoplastic resin pellets into a
shaping machine to shape them.A conventional method for preparing colored,
shaping thermoplastic resin pellets as the intermediate
product to be used in the above-mentioned method for
obtaining colored, shaped articles of thermoplastic resins
is such that uncolored resin pellets, a powdery colorant
and a blend oil such as a liquid paraffin are
mixed in a mixer, then the resulting mixture is fed to an
extruder so as to knead it in a hot molten condition
therein, the resulting melt is line-wise or sheet-wise
extruded into a water tank so as to cool it therein, and
this is granulated into granular or cubic, colored pellets
by cutting.Such colored, shaping thermoplastic resin pellets
have various advantages in that they may easily be fed to
a shaping machine where they are shaped into colored,
shaped articles as final products, they may be stored or
kept in stock and they may be distributed as they are.
Therefore, they are intermediate products which are
extremely easily handlable.However, colored, shaping thermoplastic resin
pellets to be prepared by the above-mentioned conventional
method have various problems such as those mentioned 
below. Precisely, according to the above-mentioned
conventionai method. in order that the powdery colorant and the
shaping thermoplastic resin are integrated, they have to be in a
melting state and then be granulated. Therefore, in order to
attain the storability to prevent the powdery colorant
from dropping off from the thermoplastic
