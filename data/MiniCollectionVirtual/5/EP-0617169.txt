<ABSTRACT>
A railway switch transport wagon (1) has rail running mechanisms (3) and a beam-shaped wagon frame (2) which is located centrally with respect to their axles and to which a loading platform (6) intended for connection to a switch (16) is fastened so as to be pivotable about a pivot axis (7) running in the longitudinal direction of the wagon. Provided between loading platform and wagon frame are drives for pivoting the loading platform, at least two loading platforms (6), each with at least two drives (8), being arranged at a distance from one another in the longitudinal direction of the wagon.

A switch transport wagon comprising on-track 
undercarriages (3) and a beam-shaped wagon frame (2), 

situated centrally with respect to the axles therof, to which 
a loading platform (6), provided for connection with a switch 

(16), is secured so as to pivot about an axis of rotation (7) 
extending in the longitudinal direction of the wagon, drives 

(8) for pivoting the loading platform being provided between 
the loading platform and the wagon frame, characterized in 

that at least two loading platforms (6) are arranged thereon, 
distanced from one another in the longitudinal direction of 

the wagon and each having at least two drives (8). 
A switch transport wagon according to claim 1, 
characterized in that a total of four mutually independent 

loading platforms (6) are arranged thereon. 
A switch transport wagon according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that each loading platform (6) is composed 

of at least two longitudinal supports (9), extending parallel 
both to the axis of rotation (7) and to one another in a 

common plane, and two connection elements (10) joining them 
together at the end and extending perpendicularly to the axis 

of rotation (7). 
A switch transport wagon according to claim 3, 
characterized in that each longitudinal support (9) has 

openings (11) which are arranged centrally with respect to 
the transverse direction of the wagon and are oblong in 

design, and the longitudinal sides of which extend parallel 
to the axis of rotation (7).  

 
A switch transport wagon according to one of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that holders (13), formed by bolts (12), 

bores, hooks or the like, are provided on each longitudinal 
side of the openings (11) and/or on the longitudinal sides of 

the longitudinal supports (9) extending parallel to the 
axis of rotation (7), for detachable and positive-locking 

connection to fixing brackets (17) joining the switch (16) to 
be transported to the loading platform (6). 
A switch transport wagon according to one of claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that flanges (25) are provided on 

the underside, facing the wagon frame (2), of each loading 
platform (6) for the detachable fixing of supporting rods 

(26) and two bores (27), spaced apart in the vertical 
direction, are provided in the region of the side surfaces 

of the wagon frame (2) for selective connection to the said 
supporting rods (26). 
A switch transport wagon according to one of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the axis of rotation (7) is arranged 

about 250 to about 450 mm, in a direction extending 
perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the wagon, 

away from the vertical plane of longitudinal symmetry (24) of 
the wagon frame (2). 
A switch transport wagon according to claim 5, 
characterized in that the fixing bracket (17) is essentially 

composed of a tension part (19) having a hook (20) at the 
free end and comprising a threaded part situated at the 

opposite end to the hook (20) and a wing nut (21), and a 
transverse yoke (22), extending perpendicularly to the 

tension part (19), the length of which corresponds 
approximately to a sleeper spacing.
