<ABSTRACT>
The receiver has a coefficient weighting circuit for weighting the in-phase and quadrature components of the received signal with respective coefficients dependent on the quadrature error. A correction circuit (KS) uses the decision errors (eI, eQ) of the in-phase and quadrature signal values to provide a correction value (Qs) for the quadrature error from the decision error gradients. Pref. the in-phase and quadrature components and the decision errors are combined via multipliers, adders and sign function operators to provide the correction value.

QAM receiver having first circuit means (QFK),
which weight the in-phase and quadrature signal

components of a received QAM (quadrature amplitude
modulated) signal with coefficients which depend on the

quadrature error of the transmitted QAM signal
components, and having second circuit means (KS), which

derive a correction value (
) for the quadrature error
from decision unit errors (e

decision units (E
