<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new class of
chemiluminescent, aromatic ring-fused acridinium compounds
(AFAC) which emit green or yellow light upon simple chemical
treatments. This invention also relates to conjugates
formed from AFAC and binding partners, e.g. biological
molecules, and test assays utilizing the conjugates.
Furthermore the invention relates to test assays in which
the detection and/or quantitation of two or more substances
or analytes in a test sample can be carried out
simultaneously due to the discernable and non-interfering
light emission characteristics of two or more
chemiluminescent conjugates.Chemiluminescent compounds that emit light with
separated wavelength maxima and minimally overlapping but
correctable emission spectra can be very useful in
analytical assays, particularly in industrial assays, and in
clinical diagnostic assays for multi-substance, e.g. multi-analyte,
determinations. Such compounds can be used to tag
or label binding partners, e.g. biological molecules, such
as antigens, antibodies, and nucleic acids to form
conjugates or tracers that are capable of producing mutually
non-interfering, or minimally over-lapping light emission
signals or spectra, that allow the simultaneous detection
and/or quantitation of multiple substances in a test sample.
For example, simultaneous determinations of serum levels of
luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH) from one patient sample is possible and is
demonstrated below, because two chemiluminescent compounds
having light emission spectra which span about 100-250 nm
for a spectral region with signal intensity above 5% of peak 
height, but differing in their emission maxima so that the
signals are discernable. In one example the emission maxim
of two chemiluminescent signals differ by about 60 nm and
preferably by 80 nm or more for labeling or tagging anti-LH
and anti-FSH. A further example where simultaneous
determinations is possible according to the methods
described herein, is in the assay of amplified nucleic acid
sequences, e.g. oncogenes associated with malignant
transformation. See EP-A-481 704. In such assays, the
inclusion of a parallel, internal reference material for a
known, different target sequence in the same working vessel
or reaction medium as a positive control is recognized as
important to assay performance, for example, to safeguard
false negative results. In other assay formats, the
inclusion of a known control substance will also serve to
assess assay performance.The economical
