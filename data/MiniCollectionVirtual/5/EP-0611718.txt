<ABSTRACT>
Sheet stacking apparatus comprises a sheet feed system 
formed by a belt (9) movable past a sheet stacking hopper 

(1) in a sheet accept direction to feed sheets to the 
hopper. At least one pusher member (23) is movable in the 

sheet accept direction through the hopper to push 
successive portions of a stack (24) in the hopper (1) out 

of the path of an incoming sheet so as to permit 
unrestricted entry of a sheet into the hopper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to sheet stacking apparatus.The invention is concerned with providing an improved
means for stacking sheets, such as banknotes, where an
existing stack of sheets is at the stacking position and a
new sheet has to be inserted into the stack. For example,
the stack may extend vertically and a new sheet has to be
inserted at the bottom of the stack.DE-C-626263 describes a bag stacking system. In this
case, bags are fed between a pair of feed rollers to a
stacking position. As a bag leaves the feed rollers it
drops vertically onto a bracket carried on an endless chain
which moves past a leading end of a stack of bags to push
the stack away allowing the new bag to be stacked. This
system may be suitable for bags which are relatively heavy
and can take advantage of the effect of gravity. It is not
suitable, however, for the handling of sheets such as
banknotes.The sheet stacking apparatus, according to the present
invention is disclosed in claim 1.With this invention, successive portions of the sheet
stack are pushed out of the way of the incoming sheet to
permit the sheet to enter the stack while the sheet is
positively fed into the stack.The or each pusher member may take a variety of forms
including for example a sliding protrusion but preferably
the or each pusher member is positioned on part of an 
endless belt movable to cause the pusher member to pass
through the stacking position. For example, the endless
belt may have at least one profiled portion which defines
the pusher member. The pusher member is preferably a low
friction member and most preferably defines a V-shape with
the open part of the V facing an incoming sheet.Typically, there will be at least two pusher members,
laterally spaced apart across the stacking position.The sheet feed means may take any convenient form, for
example feed rollers or suction belts but preferably
comprise at least one relatively high friction, endless
belt extending through the stacking position.The advantage of providing the or each pusher member
separate from the sheet feed means is that the pusher
member(s) are there purely to provide a gap in front of
sheets already at the stacking position and they do not
influence the edge position of the sheet being fed.Where the pusher member also forms part of an endless
belt, the sheet feed means in the form of one or more
endless belts and the pusher member belt or belts can be
mounted to extend between rollers on a common axes although
this is not essential. Preferably, however, both the sheet
feed

<CLAIMS>
Sheet stacking apparatus comprising sheet feed means
for feeding a sheet (25) in a sheet accept direction (102)

to the stacking position; and at least one pusher member
(23) separate from th
e sheet feed means and
movable in the sheet accept direction (102) through

the stacking position to push successive portions of a
stack (24) at the stacking position out of the path of an

incoming sheet (25) so as to permit unrestricted entry of
a sheet into the stack, characterised in that

the sheet feed means is located at a position in which it engages
a stack of sheets at the stacking

position so as to draw sheets through and into the stacking
position, and in that the at least one pusher member pushes successive

portions of the stack out of engagement with the sheet feed
means.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the pusher
member (23) is positioned on part of an endless belt (18)

movable to cause the pusher member (23) to pass through the
stacking position.
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the endless
belt (18) has at least one profiled portion which defines

the pusher member (23).
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the pusher member (23) defines a V-shape with the

open part of the V facing an incoming sheet (25).
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein at least two pusher members (23) are provided,

laterally spaced apart across the stacking position.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the sheet feed means includes at least one high

friction, endless belt (9) extending through the stacking
position.
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the or each sheet feed means and the or each pusher

member (23) are driven by a common motor (14).
Apparatus according to any of the preceding claims,
wherein the sheet feed means is reversible to enable sheets

to be withdrawn from the stack, the or each pusher member 
being inoperative during the feeding of sheets from the

stack (24). 
Apparatus according to claim 8, when dependent on
claim 7, wherein the motor (14) is coupled with the or each

pusher member (23) via a one way clutch such that during
the feeding of sheets from the stack (24), no drive is

communicated to the or each pusher member (23).
Apparatus according to claim 8 or claim 9, further
comprising sheet separating means (5,6) positioned upstream

of the stacking position in the sheet accept direction
(102), the sheet separating means (5,6) defining a gap

(100) which is variable between first and second positions
and through which sheets are fed by the sheet feed means,

the first position being narrower than the second position.
Apparatus according to claim 10, further comprising
means (114) for biasing the gap (100) defined by the sheet

separating means (5,6) to the first position suitable for
separating sheets fed out from the stacking position.
Apparatus according to claim 10 or claim 11, wherein
the sheet separating means comprise a pair of rollers (5,6)

between which the gap (100) is defined.
Apparatus according to claim 12, wherein one of the
rollers (6) forms part of the sheet feed means.
Apparatus according to claim 12 or claim 13, wherein
one of the rollers (5) rotates counter to the direction in

which sheets (25) are fed by the sheet feed means.
