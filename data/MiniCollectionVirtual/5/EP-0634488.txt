<ABSTRACT>
A biosensor for measuring gas-phase organic chemicals 

rapidly and accurately. The biosensor includes a thick film 
electrochemical device having an insulating substrate, electrodes 

formed on the substrate, connecting pads for the electrodes and 
an insulating layer, and a responsive membrane formed on the 

electrode portion of the electrochemical device. The responsive 
membrane is provided with a moisture-absorbing gel layer in which 

an enzyme for reacting with the gas-phase organic chemical is 
immobilized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biosensor for measuring 
gas, and more particularly to an enzymatic gas biosensor and the 
manufacturing method thereof, which can measure oxidization of a 
gas-phase organic chemical by enzymatic reaction, utilizing a 
thick film electrochemical device. Conventionally, electrochemical measurement type biosensors 
have been made by immobilizing, as a membrane, enzymes or micro-organisms 
on the surface of an electrode such as an H₂O₂ 
electrode, an oxigen electrode, an ammonium (NH₄+) ion-selective 
electrode, etc., or of an ISFET (ion-selective field effect 
transistor). Such type of biosensor can detect and measure an 
electrode-active material formed as the result of a single or 
multi-step enzymatic reaction. U.S. Patent No. 4,655,880 
discloses such a biosensor in which various kinds of oxidase 
materials are immobilized on thick film electrochemical device 
to measure electrode-active materials. Meanwhile, biosensors utilizing oxide-semiconductors are now 
widely used for measuring gas-phase chemicals, which measure the 
change of conductivity when reducing gas such as methane, carbon 
monoxide, etc. is oxidized on the surface of the sensor. In the fields of gas-solid bioreactor and the analysis 
thereof, conversion reaction of a gas-phase organic chemical by 
a dried enzyme has now been an important theme for study, and  
 
there has been great amounts of research for its application in 
the field of biotechnology. For example, a bioreactor in which 
alcohol dehydrogenase and NAD (β-Nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide) (or NADH) are treated with albumin and 
glutaraldehyde has been developed to form a gas-phase product by 
utilizing a gas-phase substrate (Biotechnol. Letters. 8(11): 783-784). 
Also, another bioreactor in which alcohol oxidase and 
catalase are adsorbed to DEAE-cellulose or controlled pore glass 
(CPG) has been developed for a similar purpose (Biotechnol. 
Bioeng. 34:1178-1185). Sensors and methods for measuring gas-phase organic 
chemicals utilizing enzymes are known in the art. U.S. Patent 
No. 4,525,704 discloses an enzymatic toxic gas sensor utilizing 
the fact that the activity of enzymatic reaction is inhibited due 
to the existence of a toxic material such as an organic 
phosphoric pesticide. International Application No. 88/01299 
teaches a method of measuring the change of color using a color-forming 
reagent after immobilizing an enzyme on an organic or 
inorganic carrier. An alcohol checker generally adopts a gas sensor, for 
example,
