<ABSTRACT>
A buck converter comprises a PWM regulation loop and 
a hysteretic control loop, which are alternatively 

enabled by a mode selection circuit of the converter in 
function of the load level. When the level of load 

drops below a preset limit as referred to a design load 
level, the converter passes from a PWM control mode to 

a hysteretic control mode, thus eliminating switching 
losses during periods of operation at relatively low 

load level.

<DESCRIPTION>
In static converters operating in a switching mode,
conversion efficiency may be improved by reducing the
conduction losses of the switch, given by the product
between the internal resistance of the switching device
and the current, plus the switching losses that are a
function of the frequency and speed of the transitions.
Normally a converter is designed for a certain level of
switched current under normal steady state conditions
of operation, by establishing case by case, beside the
size of the power devices also the switching frequency
and duty-cycle when operating in a steady state
condition.Generally, for relatively high switched currents,
conduction losses will be more relevant, while for
relatively low switched currents (that is during
periods of operation when the current level and duty-cycle
of the converter are reduced) switching losses
become more and more relevant.Several techniques for reducing the switching
frequency of the power switch when the load level
decreases in order to increase the overall conversion
efficiency of the system, are known. The known
solutions may be classified in two distinct categories:
a) the control circuit of the converter is completely
switched-off with the exception of the circuits that
handle the turn-off phase, and is reactivated when
the output voltage drops below a preset minimum
threshold, to be switched off again when the output 
voltage becomes higher than a preset maximum
threshold; b) the control system of the switch is maintained
always active, but the switch is commanded to switch
for brief bursts of high frequency switchings (burst
mode), the duration of which is established by the
time necessary for the output voltage, once has
dropped below a minimum threshold, to rise back
again above a maximum threshold.Known approaches of the first category have the
drawback that in case of integrated buck converters,
where the power switch (transistor) may also be
integrated, it is necessary to maintain active the
circuit that directly control the turn-on and the turn-off
of the power transistor. In conclusion, the limited
saving that can be achieved may be negatively
counterbalanced by an increased complexity of the
circuit, in view of the fact that special monitoring
circuits of internal voltages must be introduced.The approaches of the second category, though better
adapting themselves to situations that may exclude the
possibility of using a solution of the first category,
are not very effective in terms of power saving,
because also during periods of
