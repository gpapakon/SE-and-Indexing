<ABSTRACT>
A process for fabricating an electrophotographic imaging member including 
providing a substrate to be coated, forming a coating comprising photoconductive pigment 

particles having an average particle size of less than about 0.6 micrometer dispersed in a 
solution of a solvent comprising n-alkyl acetate having from 3 to 5 carbon atoms in the alkyl 

group and a film forming polymer having a polyvinyl butyral content between about 50 and 
about 75 mol percent, a polyvinyl alcohol content between about 12 and about 50 mol percent, 

and a polyvinyl acetate content is between about 0 to 15 mol percent, the photoconductive 
pigment particles including a mixture of at least two different phthalocyanine pigment 

particles free of vanadyl phthalocyanine pigment particles, drying the coating to remove 
substantially all of the alkyl acetate solvent to form a dried charge generation layer comprising 

between about 50 percent and about 90 percent by weight of the pigment particles based on 
the total weight of the dried charge generation layer, and forming a charge transport layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to electrophotographic imaging members and more
specifically, to a process for fabricating an electrophotographic imaging member having an
improved charge generation layer.In the art of electrophotography an electrophotographic plate comprising a
photoconductive insulating layer on a conductive layer is imaged by first uniformly
electrostatically charging the imaging surface of the photoconductive insulating layer. The
plate is then exposed to a pattern of activating electromagnetic radiation such as light, which
selectively dissipates the charge in the illuminated areas of the photoconductive insulating
layer while leaving behind an electrostatic latent image in the non-illuminated area. This
electrostatic latent image may then be developed to form a visible image by depositing finely
divided electroscopic toner particles on the surface of the photoconductive insulating layer.
The resulting visible toner image can be transferred to a suitable receiving member such as
paper. This imaging process may be repeated many times with reusable electrophotographic
imaging members.The electrophotographic imaging members may be in the form of plates, drums or
flexible belts. These electrophotographic members are usually multilayered photoreceptors
that comprise a substrate, a conductive layer, an optional hole blocking layer, an optional
adhesive layer, a charge generating layer, and a charge transport layer, an optional
overcoating layer and, in some belt embodiments, an anti-curl backing layer.A conventional technique for coating cylindrical or drum shaped photoreceptor
substrates involves dipping the substrates in coating baths. The bath used for preparing
photoconducting layers is prepared by dispersing photoconductive pigment particles in a
solvent solution of a film forming binder. Unfortunately, some organic photoconductive
pigment particles cannot be applied by dip coating to form high quality photoconductive
coatings. For example, organic photoconductive pigment particles such as benzimidazole
perylene pigments tend to settle when attempts are made to disperse the pigments in a solvent
solution of a film forming binder. The tendency of the particles to settle requires constant
stirring which can lead to entrapment of air bubbles that are carried over into the final
photoconductive coating deposited on a photoreceptor substrate. These bubbles cause defects
in final prints xerographically formed with the photoreceptor. The defects are caused by
differences in discharge of
