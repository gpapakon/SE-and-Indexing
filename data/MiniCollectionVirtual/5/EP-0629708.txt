<ABSTRACT>
In method and apparatus for producing iron and steel from iron ores 
largely composed of iron oxides, wherein a direct reduction process is used to 

produce a solid particulate intermediate product, generally known as sponge 
iron or Direct Reduced Iron (DRI); pneumatically conveying large iron-bearing 

particles, such as pelletized iron ore or particularly DRI, in a closed transport 
pipe, eg. from the reduction reactor of the direct reduction process to the 

metallurgical furnaces where liquid iron or steel are produced, for example 
electric arc furnaces, induction furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, etc. or to a 

briquetting press to form DRI briquettes, or simply to a silo or storage bin, or 
in general to a subsequent processing step for said DRI. When the carrier gas 

is recirculated for reuse, surprisingly air can be a preferred source of such gas, 
especially for reactive hot DRI. This method has a superior efficiency and 

productivity and reduces the overall energy consumption relative to currently 
used DRI steelmaking plants. 
By using pneumatic conveyors, elements of the plant may be arranged 
side by side rathe
r than one on top of the other, whereby the overall height of 
the plant may be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus applicable in the production 
of iron and steel, wherein direct reduction process and apparatus are employed 
to produce an intermediate product in the form of a particulate solid, commonly 
known as sponge iron or Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). By means of the 
invention, iron-bearing particles, including iron ore, preferably pelletized, or 
even more significantly the produced DRI (at least 90% of which is preferably 
larger than 5 mm) may be pneumatically transported from the reduction reactor 
of said reactor of said direct reduction process to a remote location for 
subsequent storage or processing, eg. preferably at melting metallurgical 
furnaces to produce liquid iron and steel. The inventive apparatus for such 
pneumatic transport has several unexpected and superior advantages. In the recent years, the necessity of rendering the steelmaking 
processes more efficient, more productive, and less wasteful,
 
has become increasingly urgent, due to rising production costs (particularly 
energy costs) and also due to the  
 
increasing restrictions imposed upon steel plants for ecological 
reasons. One of the successful routes for producing steel, which 
is being increasingly promoted and has become more widely 
utilized, is the direct reduction without melting of lumps or 
pellets of ore with subsequent electric arc furnace refining. 
This is in contrast to the traditional steel plants using blast 
furnaces and basic oxygen converter furnaces for making steel 
from melted ore. Although in the present specification a 
preferred embodiment of the invention is described as applied to 
a steelmaking plant comprising a direct reduction plant and 
electric arc furnaces, it is evident that the invention in its 
broader aspects can be adapted to other applications where DRI or 
other metallic iron bearing particles (hot or cold) such as 
pelletized or lump ore are to be transported. In order to better understand the invention, some of 
the characteristics of DRI are given herein, which will help one 
to appreciate why pneumatic transport systems had never been 
previously recommended for handling of iron ore and/or DRI during 
the commercial production of DRI nor ever successfully so used 
before with large particles of such material (i.e. involving 
sizes mostly on the order of 0.5 mm or larger). DRI is commercially produced by direct reduction of 
lumps or pellets of iron ore by contacting these with a stream of 
reducing gas at a high temperature. Reduction is
