<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to microporous polymers which are oleophobically modified at their surface. The invention also relates to processes for the production of the oleophobically modified microporous polymers. The modifiers used are perfluoropolyethers. If the perfluoropolyethers used contain, for example, hydroxyl groups, they impart additional hydrophily to the polymer.
