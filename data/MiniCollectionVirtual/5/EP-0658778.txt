<ABSTRACT>
An automated method for analyzing the
photometric calibration and image quality performance

characteristics of a high resolution storage phosphor
reader (10). A custom fabricated, lead mask test target

(104) is secured to a storage phosphor (106) and exposed
using a standard medical x-ray source (100). A storage

phosphor reader (10), to be calibrated, reads the exposed
storage phosphor (106) to produce a digital x-ray image.

The digital x-ray image is analyzed by means of a
computer algorithm which presents analytic results in

text and graphical form to isolate reader problems and to
quantify calibration status of the reader (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to storage
phosphor imaging systems and more particularly to an
automated technique for analyzing the photometric
calibration and image quality performance
characteristics of a high resolution storage phosphor
reader.US-A-Re. 31,847 discloses a storage phosphor
system in which a storage phosphor is exposed to an x-ray
image of an object, such as the body part of a
patient, to record a latent x-ray image in the storage
phosphor. The latent x-ray image is read out by
stimulating the storage phosphor with relatively long
wavelength stimulating radiation such as red or
infrared light produced by a helium neon gas laser or
diode laser. Upon stimulation, the storage phosphor
releases emitted radiation of an intermediate
wavelength, such as blue light, in proportion to the
quantity of x-rays that were received. To produce a
signal useful in electronic image processing the
storage phosphor is scanned in a raster pattern by a
laser beam deflected by an oscillating or rotating
scanning mirror or by a rotating hologon. The emitted
radiation from the storage phosphor is reflected by a
mirror light collector and detected by a photodetector,
such as a photomultiplier, to produce an electronic x-ray
image signal. Typically the storage phosphor is
translated in a page scan direction past the laser beam
which is repeatedly deflected in a line scan direction
perpendicular to the page scan motion of the storage
phosphor to form a scanning raster pattern of a matrix
of pixels.The x-ray image signal can then be viewed as
a visual image produced by a softcopy display device,
such as a video display (CRT, LCD) or a hardcopy 
display device, such as a x-ray film printer (laser
printer, CRT printer, thermal printer).A problem exists in providing an automated
technique for analyzing the photometric calibration and
image quality performance characteristics of a high
resolution storage phosphor reader. It is desirable
that such a technique yield a comprehensive and
reliable assessment of the reader performance and be
compatible for use in field (hospital) and
manufacturing environments. It is also desirable that
the technique provide analysis of the following.
1) Exposure latitude and photometric
response linearity over the 10,000:1 dynamic range of
the storage phosphor.2) Signal to Noise Ratio over the effective
exposure latitudes.3) Spatial resolution (MTF).4) Geometric scan linearity.5) Banding artifacts due to mechanical
vibration.6) Electronic noise artifacts.7) Flare artifact
