<ABSTRACT>
Starting from a sequence of values of indicated torque 
(C
i
) detected for each expected combustion in the engine 
a cycle signal (D
i
) is generated as a combination of at 
least two successive values of the said sequence. The 

peak value (PP1
i
) of the said cycle signal is then 
compared with a comparison threshold (Ca) chosen 

preferably in proportion to the fuel injection duration 
into the cylinders. Misfires are identified preferably 

from the result of a comparison between the said peak 

value (PP1
i
) and the said comparison threshold (Ca) which 
differs from the result of comparison in the presence of 

regular operation of the engine (M).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to the problem
of detecting loss of combustion ("misfires" or
"misfiring") in the operation of an internal combustion
engine, for example in internal combustion engines
mounted on motor vehicles such as motor cars.The term loss of combustion (or misfire) indicates an
anomalous situation in the normal operation of the
engine.The air-petrol mixture introduced into the cylinder does
not generate the normal chemical reaction of a combustion
engine, but is expelled completely or partially unburnt
into the exhaust. As an immediate effect this generates
an instantaneous loss of engine torque.The unburnt mixture arrives at the exhaust where it burns
causing an increase in the temperature of the silencer.In the case of engines having catalytic converters in
their silencers this increase in heating is the main
cause of damage to the catalyser 
Misfires can arise following:
malfunctioning of an injectorloss of spark from a spark plugmixture too lean or too rich.Misfires can cause more or less damage according to the
timing and number of misfires which occur.For example, a misfire generated with the engine at full
power is more serious than one at partial power, and a
train of misfires (a series of consecutive combustion
losses) is more damaging than a number of single and
isolated misfires.The increasing sensitivity to the problems of protection
of the environment leads, as is known, to the definition
of ever more stringent regulations in relation to the
polluting emissions of internal combustion engines and to
the phenomena attributed to such emissions. For example,
the Californian CARB OBD-2 Regulation, which will come into
force in 1996 throughout the entire territory of the
United States requires, among other things, detection of
misfiring.The identification of this anomaly will have to be
indicated to the user by the activation of an alarm
(warning light on the dashboard, which illuminates and
cannot be extinguished). This function is intended to 
protect the catalytic converter in the silencer.The application of the OBD-2 Regulation could cause serious
inconvenience to the user who, at each operation of the
alarm, could be constrained to go to a garage. On the
other hand, if the engine is equipped with an automatic
injection calibration system capable of maintaining it
always perfectly centred, this significantly reduces the
probability that the OBD-2 alarm will activate.The most widely known methods for the diagnosis of
misfiring are:
analysis of the signal

A process for detecting misfires in an internal
combustion engine (M), characterised in that it comprises

the steps of:

detecting, for each expected combustion, the value of
the indicated torque of the engine (M), generating a

corresponding sequence of values (...,Ci,...),
generating, as a combination of at least two successive

determining a peak value (PP1

determining a threshold value (Ca) corresponding to the
expected torque of the engine in the presence of

effective combustion, and
comparing the said peak value (PP1
i
 ; PP4

the said threshold value (Ca), thereby identifying a misfire

when the result of the said comparison is different from
the result of the comparison in the presence of regular

operation of the engine (M).
