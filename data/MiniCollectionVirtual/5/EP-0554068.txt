<ABSTRACT>
A clamping assembly for an injection moulding installation, 
characterised in that it comprises:

 
   a rigid elongated base frame (51);

 
   a fixed platen (52) mounted with respect to said base frame so that 

there is inhibited displacement in a longitudinal axial direction of the 

base frame of the fixed platen with respect to the base frame;
 

   a movable platen (53);
 

   longitudinal sliding bearings (55,56) fixed with respect to said base frame (51) 
and on which said movable platen (53) is mounted, said bearings being 

positioned substantially outside the effective clamping region between 
said platens; and

 
   platen drive means (60,61) rigidly mounted with respect to said base frame (51) 

and coupled to said movable platen (53) for transmitting thereto an axially 
directed displacement;

 
   the arrangement being such that said clamping region is substantially 

free of any bending induced in said base frame and arising from 
clamping forces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clamping assembly for an
injection moulding installation according to the precharacterising
portion of claim 1.An injection moulding apparatus typically comprises fixed and
movable load-bearing platens which are adapted to clamp between them
respective halves of a two-part mould. By means of an hydraulically or
mechanically operated ram, pressure is applied to the movable platen so
as to clamp together the two halves of the mould into which molten
plastics material is then injected at pressure which can often be very high.
In order to ensure that the two sections of the mould are not displaced
with respect to each other as a result of the high pressure injection of the
plastics material, a high clamping force has to be applied so as to hold
together the two sections of the mould.Hitherto proposed apparatus for achieving these objectives
are well known in the art and have been available for many years. Thus,
for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,128,501 (J.E. Borah) describes a power
operated multiple press, the principles of which have changed little since
the publication of this patent. Borah describes an apparatus which
includes fixed and movable platens which are slidably supported with 
respect to each other by means of four corner posts or tie bars located
respectively at the four corners of the two platens, such that the movable
platen may slide along these posts towards and away from the fixed
platen. The two halves of a mould are substantially symmetrically
supported by facing surfaces of the two platens, the clamping force being
directed along an axis which is substantially collinear with the axis of
symmetry of the mould.With such known structures, the presence of the four tie bars
seriously limits the accessibility of the region between the platens insofar
as the introduction and removal of the mould sections are concerned.
This limitation is particularly troublesome when one bears in mind that
the mould sections can be of significant size, complex shape and
significant weight and require to be manoeuvred into position and
removed therefrom using mechanical handling equipment. Furthermore,
this relative inaccessibility of the clamping space seriously limits the
degree of automation which could otherwise be employed in connection
with the introduction and removal of the mould sections.US-A-4345893 discloses a moulding machine
suitable for injection moulding having a rigid base frame
supporting two die halves and a ram for converging and
diverging the die halves

<CLAIMS>
A clamping assembly for an injection molding installation
comprising a rigid elongated positioning structure;


a fixed platen (41) rigidly coupled to said positioning structure;
a movable platen (43') slidingly supported for free axial
displacement with respect to the positioning structure towards and away from the

fixed platen (41) defining therewith a clamping region;
platen drive means (44,45) coupled to the movable platen
(43') for imparting said displacement thereto; and
an elongated clamping structure (48'), the fixed platen
(9,41) being articulatedly coupled to a first end portion of the clamping structure

and the platen drive means (44,45) being articulatedly coupled to a
second and opposite end portion of the clamping structure,

characterized in that
said platen drive means (44,45) includes a hydraulic piston
(45) which is directly and rigidly coupled to the movable platen (43') said platen

drive means being slidingly supported on said positioning structure for limited free
axial displacement with respect to said fixed platen, and
said clamping structure comprises a pair of unitary elongated
.

clamping arms (48') respectively located on either side outside of said positioning
structure (42') and extending along the axial extent of said clamping

region, one pair of adjacent ends of said arms being pivotally coupled to said fixed
platen (41), an opposite pair of adjacent ends of said arms being pivotally

coupled to said platen drive means (44,45).
