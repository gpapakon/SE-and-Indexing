<ABSTRACT>
A partial amino acid sequence of an endo- beta -1,4-glucanase obtainable by means of Aspergillus aculeatus is described, and also corresponding recombinant DNA sequences, vectors and transformed hosts. Use of the endo- beta -1,4-glucanase or a pectinase preparation enriched with the endo- beta -1,4-glucanase for degradation or modification of plant cell walls is described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention comprises an endo-β-1,4-glucanase, a corresponding DNA
sequence, a vector, a transformed host, a method for production of an endo-β-1,4-glucanase,
an enzyme preparation, and a use of the endo-β-1,4-glucanase.The invention relates to genetic engineering and provides a partial amino
acid sequence of an endo-β-1,4-glucanase and partial DNA sequences.Endo-β-1,4-glucanases (EC no. 3.2.1.4) is a group of hydrolases, which
catalyse endo hydrolysis of 1,4-β-D-glycosidic linkages in cellulose, lichenin, cereal
β-D-glucans and other plant material containing cellulosic parts. The authorized
name is endo-1,4-β-D-glucan 4-glucano hydrolase, but the short term endo-β-1,4-glucanase
is used in this specification with claims. Reference can be made to R.F.
Gould, "Cellulases and their Application", Advances in Chemistry Series 55, American
Chemical Society (1969), T.M. Wood, "Properties and Mode of Action of Cellulases",
in Biotechnology and Bioengineering Symposium, no. 5, John Wiley, 111-137 (1975),
Y.-H. Lee and L.T. Fan", Properties and Mode of Action of Cellulose", Advances in
Biochemical engineering 17, 101-129 (1980), J. Goksøyr and J. Eriksen, "Cellulases"
in A.H. Rouse, Microbial Enzymes and Bioconversions, Academic Press, 283-330
(1980), T.-M. Enveri, "Microbial Cellulases" in W.M. Fogarty, Microbial Enzymes and
Biotechnology, Applied Science Publishers, 183-224 (1983). Celluloses are found in
connection with many gums and they are components of cell walls in e.g. fruits,
vegetables and cereals.The above indicated partial amino acid sequence can be used for
construction of DNA probes which can be used for screening a genomic library for
organisms expressing such enzyme, or a cDNA library, thereby obtaining DNA
sequences, which can be used either for an overproduction of endo-β-1,4-glucanase,
if inserted in the microorganism species, from which the parent DNA
molecule originated, or for production of endo-β-1,4-glucanase without
accompanying closely related enzymes, if inserted in a host microorganism, which
in its not-transformed condition does not produce any enzymes closely related to
endo-β-1,4-glucanase. The DNA sequences can be established otherwise, as will
apppear from the following. Thus, the purpose of the invention is the provision of a new endo-β-1,4-glucanase
and of means and methods for production of endo-β-1,4-glucanase in
better yield and higher purity than hitherto possible, and of a use of endo-β-1,4-glucanase
either alone or in combination with other enzymes for degradation of
