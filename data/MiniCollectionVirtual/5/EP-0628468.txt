<ABSTRACT>
Seat attachment to walls of a skeleton frame, the skeleton frame containing, as vertical elements, inter alia, seat rails, diagonal-connection receptacles, side-wall pillars or brackets and a floor, and the seat attachment containing an upper transverse support (2) and a diagonal connection (3) leading downwards, and the upper transverse support being fastened to vertical elements and the diagonal connection being fastened to vertical elements or in the corner region between vertical elements and the floor. The diagonal connection is supported at its lower end via a lower diagonal-connection receptacle, the latter containing an element (1) which is stiff against torsion, or is connected to an element which is stiff against torsion. The element (1) which is stiff against torsion extends over at least the length of a seat arrangement, or over the length of the entire skeleton frame, and the element which is stiff against torsion is supported, for its part, on the floor of the skeleton frame.

<CLAIMS>
Seat attachment on the vertical sides of a framework, in which the framework
comprises a seat rail (15), a diagonal brace receiver (10), side wall columns (13)

and/or brackets as vertical elements and a base (7) and in which the seat
attachment comprises a horizontal top cross beam (2) and a downwardly directed

diagonal brace (3) and in which the cross beam (2) is secured to vertical elements
and the diagonal brace is secured to vertical elements or in the corner region

between vertical elements and the base (7), the diagonal brace (3) is supported at
its bottom end via a diagonal brace receiver (10) comprising a torsion-resistant

element (1) or rigidly connected to a torsion-resistant element (1), and the torsion-resistant
element (1) extends over at least the length of one seat arrangement

within the framework, characterised in that the torsion-resistant element (1) is a
window section or an edge section of a base plate and the diagonal brace receiver

(10) is rigidly connected to the window section or the edge section above the
latter.
Seat attachment according to claim 1, characterised in that the diagonal brace
receiver (10) is part of the side wall column (13) or bracket and the side wall

column (13) or bracket is rigidly connected to the torsion-resistant element (1).
Seat attachment according to claim 1, characterised in that the diagonal brace
receiver (10) is a bottom boom which is rigidly secured to the torsion-resistant

element (1) and the bottom boom extends over the entire length or parts of the
length of the torsion-resistant element (1).
Seat attachment according to claim 1, characterised in that the top cross beam (2)
is secured to a seat rail (15) and the seat rail (15) is a section which extends over

the entire length or parts of the length of the framework.
Seat attachment according to claim 1, characterised in that the seat rail (15) is
secured to a longitudinal boom and/or to brackets and/or to side wall columns

(13). 
Seat attachment according to claim 1, characterised in that the brackets and the
side wall columns (13) are secured to the torsion-resistant element (1).
Seat attachment according to claim 1, characterised in that the torsion-resistant
element (1) is supported on the base (7) and the base (7) is a ladder frame or a

composite panel.
Use of the seat attachment according to claim 1 in frameworks.
Use of the seat attachment according to claim 1 in frameworks for land vehicles,
watercraft, railway carriages, coaches, buses or cable cars.
Use of the seat attachment according to claim 1 in frameworks for low-floor
coaches and buses.
