<ABSTRACT>
An assembly of air and fuel/air nozzles (14,16), the 
fuel being comminuted coal, are generally of the kind 

used in a rectangular cross section combustion chamber of 
an industrial boiler. The air nozzles (14) however, are 

tilted relative to the fuel/air nozzle (16) so as to 
diverge therefrom. There results a space between the air 

flows and the fuel/air flow, which becomes filled with a 
circulatory flow of the products of combustion. By this 

means mixing of the air and fuel air flows is delayed and 
results in a considerable reduction in NOx production.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel/air nozzle
assembly of the kind utilised in the combustion chamber
of an industrial boiler. Such nozzle assemblies comprise
one or more nozzles which emit a mixture of fuel (coal,
gas or oil) and air, and further nozzles which straddle
the or each mixed flow nozzle and which emit only air.In some known arrangements all of the nozzles are
fixed and in other known arrangements, all of the nozzles
are pivotable in a common plane. In both arrangements
however, the axes of the nozzles are maintained in
parallel with each other.Some of the nozzles described hereinbefore often
include such features as flame attachment features,
wherein on ignition of the fuel/air mix, the resulting
flame attaches to the nozzle outlet plane and extends
therefrom into the combustion chamber. Ensuring that
this phenomenon occurs achieves a reduction in the
production of nitrous oxide.It is also known from EP-A-0399462 to reduce NOx by
injecting the oxidant and fuel separately into a
combustion zone. The oxidant is injected into the
combustion chamber at an angle which diverges away from
the axis of the fuel nozzle. To reduce the NOx emissions
in the arrangement described in EP-A-0399462 the oxidant
is injected with a momentum equal to at least three time
the fuel stream momentum.The present invention seeks to provide a simplified
air and fuel/air nozzle assembly construction, use of
which further reduces NOx production.According to the present invention an air and
fuel/air nozzle assembly comprises a first nozzle through
which in operation a mixed flow of fuel and air, which
defines a fuel/air flowpath, passes to a combustion
chamber, and air nozzles which straddle said first nozzle
characterised in that each air nozzle is provided with 
deflectors so angled to deflect air from the air nozzle
towards the axis of the air nozzle.The deflectors may be arranged to deflect the air
from the air nozzles towards the axis of the air nozzle
at an included angle of up to 20° or by an included angle
of at least 20°.The assembly may be pivotable so as to enable
simultaneous tilting of the nozzles relative to
respective air and fuel/air passageway structure to which
for operation the nozzles are connected. Preferably the
nozzles of the nozzle assembly are interconnected by a
linkage to achieve simultaneous tilting.A further aspect of the present invention is a
method for reducing NOx production during combustion
which comprises conveying a fuel by air such that a
mixture of air and fuel is formed and
