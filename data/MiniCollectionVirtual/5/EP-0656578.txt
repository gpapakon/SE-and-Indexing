<ABSTRACT>
A computer system is provided that employs a disable 
technique which warns the user of a low battery condition when 

the user attempts to power-on the computer, and which prevents 
power from being applied to a primary portion of the computer 

system. A battery monitor is included for monitoring the voltage 
across the battery, and for asserting a control signal when the 

battery voltage drops below a certain threshold value. A control 
unit receives the control signal and accordingly prevents power 

from being applied to a primary computer subsystem when the 
computer system is turned on. Instead, when the user attempts to 

turn on the computer system when the low battery-capacity 
condition exists, the control unit causes a pulse generator to 

generate a signal that drives a speaker. An audible indication 
of the low power condition is thereby produced. In accordance, 

the user is alerted to the low battery condition, while further 
power is prevented from being depleted from the battery as a 

result of applying power to the primary computer subsystem.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to portable computer systems and more
particularly to low battery detection and indicator circuitry for
portable computer systems.It is frequently desirable to warn the user of a portable
computer system of a condition when the battery capacity is low.
Accordingly, a variety of battery monitors and so-called "fuel
gauges" have been developed that provide an external indicator of
a low battery-capacity condition. These external indicators
include both LED indicators and visual displays incorporated on
the computer screen. The battery monitors may indicate when the
battery capacity, as inferred by the voltage across the battery,
decreases below a certain threshold, or may indicate the capacity
of the battery over a broad range of possible values.In portable computer systems, if the battery capacity is
diminished to a critical point, damage to the battery and other
system components may occur. If the computer is powered-on, the
user may receive the indication of the low battery condition in
real time and may accordingly power-down the system to recharge
the battery. If, on the other hand, the computer is in a
powered-off state or in a power-conserving suspend state (during
which, for example, the CPU clock signal and the system clock
signal may be stopped), the user may be unaware of a law battery
condition. Thus, if the user subsequently attempts to turn on
the computer system or the system attempts to restart the CPU and
system clock signals, the battery will be drained even further. This can damage the battery and other system components.Examples of power-conserving power management systems for portable computers are
disclosed in our co-pending patent applications published as EP-A-0,656,579, EP-A-0,645,690
and EP-A-654,726. Another such example is in EP-A-565,914 which
discloses minimising power consumption by collecting and interpreting power related
data at various processing elements while hiding many of the details from the end-user.The present invention is directed to the problem mentioned above when a user
attempts to turn on the computer from a powered-off state and is unaware of a low
battery condition.According to the present invention there is provided a portable computer system
comprising: a primary computer subsystem; a battery pack; a user activated power
switch coupled between said battery pack and said primary computer subsystem for
providing power from said battery pack through said power switch to said primary
computer subsystem; a battery monitor unit for
