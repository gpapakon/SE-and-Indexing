<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a soil cultivating 
machine comprising a frame (2) in which soil working members 

(3) are accommodated and a pneumatic seed drill (5) which 
includes, connected to a carrier (68), seed delivery members 

(74) for depositing seeds in the soil and at least one 
distributor member (71). The carrier (68) is coupled to the 

frame (2) via, seen in a side view, a pivotal four-bar 
linkage (202) having two arms (233, 87) which predominantly 

extend in the direction of operative travel, one (233) of the 
two arms comprising a control element (233) for adjusting the 

length of the arm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a soil cultivating
machine comprising at least two frame portions aligned
horizontally and substantially perpendicular to the direction
of operative travel during operation and pivotable towards a
transport position wherein the frame portions are arranged-side-by-side
in upward direction, in each of which frame
portions soil working members are accommodated and to each of
which a pneumatic seed drill is coupled by means of a pivotal connecting
structure, which seed drill includes, connected to a
carrier, seed delivery members for depositing seeds in the
soil and at least one distributor member, the machine further
comprising an adjusting element for rotating the carrier.Such a machine is known from the European Patent
Application 0 478 095. In the machine according to this
document a pneumatic seed drill is mounted to a frame portion
by means of a connecting structure. Upon folding the frame
portions towards vertically orientated transport positions
the seed distributor member of the known machine is pivoted
forwardly relative to a carrier beam for the seed delivery
members. The present invention has for its object a further
optimalization of the known machine.According to the invention this is achieved in that
the pivotal connecting structure comprises a lower element
and an upper element, which upper element is pivotally
connected to an upwardly extending support by which a distributor
member is arranged on the carrier, said support
comprising two upwardly extending portions, which are pivotal
relative to each other about a transverse axis, the lower
most portion being connected to the carrier, the adjusting
element being arranged to rotate the carrier, such that upon
actuation of the adjusting element the seed delivery members
are pivoted upwardly away from a working position near soil
level, and the distributor member is pivoted from an upright
working position rearwardly and downwardly relative to the 
carrier. In this way the seed delivery members are lifted
still further away from the soil than is already achieved in
the known machine through the lifting of the relevant frame
portion.The construction has the advantage that when the
frame portions of the machine are folded to its upwardly
directed positions, which is made possible through the
rearward deflection of the distributor member, the outer ends
of the seed delivery members are deflected inwardly relative
to the frame portions, so that behind a carrying tractor
somewhat more manoeuvring space is

<CLAIMS>
A soil cultivating machine comprising at least two
frame portions (2) aligned horizontally and substantially

perpendicular to the direction of operative travel during
operation and pivotable towards a transport position wherein

the frame portions are arranged side-by-side in upward
direction, in each of which frame portions (2) soil working

members (3) are accommodated and to each of which a pneumatic
seed drill (68 - 74) is coupled by means of a pivotal connecting

structure (202), which seed drill includes, connected to a
carrier (68), seed delivery members (73, 74) for depositing

seeds in the soil and at least one distributor member (71),
the machine further comprising an adjusting element (233) for

rotating the carrier (68),
characterized in that the pivotal connecting structure (202)

comprises a lower element (87) and an upper element (218),
which upper element is pivotally connected to an upwardly

extending support (217) by which a distributor member (71) is
arranged on the carrier (68), said support comprising two

upwardly extending portions (220, 214), which are pivotal
relative to each other about a transverse axis, the lower

most portion (214) being connected to the carrier (68), the
adjusting element (233) being arranged to rotate the carrier

(68), such that upon actuation of the adjusting element (233)
the seed delivery members (73, 74) are pivoted upwardly away

from a working position near soil level, and the distributor
member is pivoted from an upright working position rearwardly

and downwardly relative to the carrier (68).
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the carrier (68) is coupled to the

frame (2) and the pivotal action occurs automatically.
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in claim ?,
characterized in that the upper element (218) constructed as

a spacer element is arranged pivotally between the frame (2)
and the upper portion (220) of the holder (217) of a distributor

member (71). 
A soil cultivating machine as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that via a four-bar

linkage (200) which approaches a parallelogram the frame is
connected by means of two arms (11, 12) which predominantly

A soil cultivating machine as claimed in claim 4,
characterized in that the centre-to-centre distance between

the pivot shafts of the upper arm (11) is less within a range
from 5 to 18%, and preferably 10%, than the corresponding
