<ABSTRACT>
A soft membrane booted transducer for performing 
ultrasonic inspections of parts and components that have 

rough sound beam entry surfaces. These rough surfaces 
may be in the form of as-welded unprepared overlays, 

cladded components, as-cast parts, or other unprepared 
surfaces that tend to prohibit, or prevent, sound entry 

from normal, smooth, hard-surfaced transducer contacting 
shoes made from Lucite or similar materials. The booted 

ultrasonic transducer has a soft membrane boot (22 or 
22') for coupling the transducer to an uneven or rough 

sound beam entry surface. The soft membrane is made of 
a flexible material capable of transmitting ultrasonic 

waves. When pressed into contact with the uneven or 
rough surface of the object being inspected, the membrane 

flexes to generally conform to the shape of the 
contacted surface. Flexing of the membrane eliminates 

or reduces air gaps between the transducer and the object 
surface, thereby increasing the ultrasonic coupling 

between the piezoelectric element and the object.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to non-destructive 
examination of material, such as metal or alloy, for 
voids, flaws, cracks and other defects that can be 
detrimental to the integrity of the material. Specifically, 
the invention relates to the ultrasonic inspection 
of parts and components that have rough sound beam 
entry surfaces. Ultrasonic examinations are performed within the 
nuclear industry and most other major industries to 
determine the condition of parts and components. The 
metal or alloy material of a part or component is 
inspected using ultrasound to detect any flaws which 
could prove detrimental to the safe operation of that 
part or component. The ultrasonic nondestructive examination 
method can be used to detect internal flaws in 
most engineering metals and alloys. Bonds produced by 
welding, brazing, soldering and adhesive bonding can 
also be ultrasonically inspected. Ultrasonic inspection is used for quality control 
and materials inspection in the fabrication of structures, 
reactor pressure vessels, airframes, pipe systems, 
bridges, motor vehicles and jet engines. The present 
invention has application in all of these fields. For successful application of ultrasonic examination 
techniques, methods and equipment, the ultrasonic 
system, including transducers, must be suitable for the  
 
type of inspection being performed. If the correct 
transducer is not used, there is a high potential for 
gross error in the inspection results, or there could 
be no results at all. For instance, using a common 
ultrasonic transducer that has a hard flat-surfaced 
lucite wedge for examining as-welded overlaid pipe welds 
results in gross errors in the ultrasonic inspection 
results. In many cases ultrasonic inspection data is 
not recorded at all. This is due to the presence of air 
gaps between the transducer head and the rough surface 
being inspected, which forms an opaque barrier. Ultrasonic characterization of cracks in materials 
is at least a two-step process: 1) detection and 
location; and 2) sizing in absolute or relative terms. 
In accordance with the first step of this process, the 
transducer is excited to emit a longitudinal ultrasonic 
wave which is coupled to the structure being inspected. 
The emitted wave enters the structure, where it is reflected 
by the crack. The return path of the reflected 
wave impinges on the transducer, where it is detected 
as a "pulse echo" signal. The determination of the crack size, or depth of 
penetration in the case of
