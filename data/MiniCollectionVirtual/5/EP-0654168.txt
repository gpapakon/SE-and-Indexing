<ABSTRACT>
A fault-tolerant, high-speed wafer scale system comprises a plurality of functional modules, a parallel hierarchical bus which is fault-tolerant to defects in an interconnect network, and one or more bus masters. This bus includes a plurality of bus lines segmented into sections and linked together by programmable bus switches and bus transceivers or repeaters in an interconnect network. By: 1) use of small block size (512K bit) for the memory modules; 2) use of programmable identification register to facilitate dynamic address mapping and relatively easy incorporation of global redundancy; 3) use of a grid structure for the bus to provide global redundancy for the interconnect network; 4) use of a relatively narrow bus consisting of 13 signal lines to keep the total area occupied by the small bus; 5) use of segmented bus lines connected by programmable switches and programmable bus transceivers to facilitate easy isolation of bus defects; 6) use of special circuit for bus transceivers and asynchronous handshakes to facilitate dynamic bus configuration; 7) use of programmable control register to facilitate run-time bus reconfiguration; 8) use of spare bus lines to provide local redundancy for the bus; and 9) use of spare rows and columns in the memory module to provide local redundancy, high defect tolerance in the hierarchical bus is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to wafer-scale circuit integration, in
particular to a wafer-scale integrated circuit system comprising data processing
elements partitioned into modules, a parallel high-speed hierarchical bus, and one or
more bus masters which control the bus operation, bus and a bus interface thereof.Wafer-scale integration provides more transistors in a single large chip, which
allows more functions to be integrated in a small printed circuit board area. Systems
built with wafer-scale integration therefore have higher performance, higher reliability
and lower cost.The major barrier to a successful wafer-scale system has been defects inherent
in the fabrication process which may render a substantial part of or the whole system
nonfunctional. Therefore, it is important to have an effective defect tolerant scheme
which allows the overall system to function despite failure of some of its functional
blocks. One effective way to manage defects is 
to partition the wafer-scale system into identical small
blocks so that defective blocks can be eliminated. The
area of each block is usually made small so that the
overall block yield is high. If the number of defective
blocks is small, the performance of the system as a whole
is not substantially affected. The blocks are in general
connected together by an interconnect network which
provides communication links between each block and the
outside. Since the blocks are usually small, information
processing within each block is relatively fast and the
overall system performance is largely determined by the
performance (bandwidth and latency) of the network. Since
the network may extend over the entire wafer, its total
area is significant and it is highly susceptible to
defects. Therefore, it is important for the network to be
highly tolerant to defects. Traditionally, high
communication performance and defect tolerance are
conflicting requirements on the network. High
communication performance, such as short latency and high
bandwidth, requires large numbers of parallel lines in the
network which occupy a large area, making it more
susceptible to defects.By limiting the direct connection to be between
neighboring blocks only, a serial bus system offers high
defect tolerance and simplicity in bus configuration.
Systems using a serial bus are described, for instance, in

25, No. 4, April 1992, pp. 10 - 18; McDonald US Patent
