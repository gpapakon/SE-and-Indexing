<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for remotely displaying the inflation pressure within an inflator (11) for inflating a balloon catheter. The apparatus comprises a pressure transducer (40) positioned to sense pressure within the syringe, a transmission unit (502) receiving a pressure signal from the transducer and transmitting by means of infrared light pulse sequences, a pressure message reflective of the pressure signal. A monitor (500) positionable at a distance from the transmission unit receives and decodes the pressure messages, and provides a display thereof. A timer key (518) for initiating the transmission of start/stop clock messages is located on the inflator unit. The monitor further includes a timer responsive to received clock messages, and an elapsed time display (520).

<DESCRIPTION>
Field: The invention relates to medical
monitoring technology and more particularly to a monitor
for a device used in angioplasty.State of the Art: Balloon angioplasty,
technically referred to as percutaneous transluminal
angioplasty, is a procedure performed by a cardiologist
on a patient under local anesthesia to open arteries
blocked with plaque or other fatty deposits. A catheter
with a dilatable (inflatable or deflatable) balloon at or
near its tip is threaded into and through an artery and
to the stenotic region. The balloon is then inflated
thereby compressing the plaque against and into the
arterial wall. In this manner the vessel's interior
diameter is widened to again permit sufficient flow of
blood. This procedure is utilized in the peripheral
arteries as well as the coronary arteries. A balloon
catheter is described and illustrated in U.S. Patent
4,519,403.Typically, the balloon is inflated utilizing a
fluid such as a mixture of equal parts of a contrast
media and saline solution, which fluid exerts the
dilation pressure. An inflation syringe assembly or
device is utilized to deliver the inflation medium or
fluid to the balloon as well as to provide the pressure
needed for dilation. Continuous pressure readings can be
obtained by having the inflation syringe assembly coupled
in series to a pressure reading device such as a
manometer.It is important that the inflation syringe
assembly not only deliver fluid and maintain the pressure
but also, in particular, release the pressure rapidly
when needed.Typical quick-release syringe devices
heretofore disclosed in the art include those described
in U.S. Patents 4,832,692 to Box et al., and 4,723,939 to
Goodin et al. The Box device utilizes an external lever 
located above the syringe barrel to release a splined
block which engages/disengages a threaded plunger rod.
The Goodin device employs a threaded plunger rod which is
engaged/disengaged by a rotatable locking knob.
Actuation of these release mechanisms may require a
change of hand position on the syringe assembly.Additionally, for safe and effective operation
of the inflation syringe, it is important that the user
have knowledge of the pressure exerted by the inflation
syringe and the time elapsed with the balloon in the
inflated state. Thus, a pressure sensor is associated
with a monitoring readout device which displays the
pressure readings. Previous such readout devices have
generally taken the form of a box-like device attached to
the pressure sensor by a data communication cable, the
box
