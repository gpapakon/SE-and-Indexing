<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle brake vibration-and-noise damping insert is comprised ot two thin plates (1, 2) and an intermediate damping layer (3). The damping layer (3) is comprised of a rubber layer (4) which has been vulcanized to the two metal plates (1, 2). The invention also relates to a method of producing a material web for the manufacture of this type of insert. A first sheet-metal strip is coated on one side thereof with a rubber layer, while one side of a second sheet-metal strip is coated with an adhesive. The two metal strips are passed through a band vulcanizing machine with the coated sides of the strips facing one another, so as to vulcanize the rubber layer to the two metal strips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibration-and-noise 
damping insert for vehicle brakes comprising two thin metal plates and a damping layer to be vulcanized enclosed there between, and a method of 
producing a web for the manufacture of such inserts. When operating the disc brakes of automotive vehicles, 
the friction pads are pressed against to a rotating 
brake disc by means of a hydraulic piston-cylinder 
device. Many present-day disc brake systems utilize 
vibration-and-sound damping inserts or shims which are 
fitted to the friction pads, between said pads and their 
respective piston-cylinder devices. The inserts are 
normally comprised of thin metal plates or strips of 
non-woven material, which are coated on both sides with 
a rubber layer. These inserts prevent the brakes from 
squealing or squeaking. In the case of vehicle disc brakes of this kind, and in 
particular in the case of the disc brakes of heavy 
vehicles, the piston rod of the hydraulic piston-cylinder 
unit tends to "eat" into the rubber layer facing 
said rod and create therein depressions which have the 
effect of reducing considerably the vibration-and-sound 
damping effect of the inserts. This problem has earlier 
been solved with the aid of an insert comprised of two 
thin steel plates which are bonded together by a layer 
of adhesive. A serious drawback with this solution, however, 
is that the adhesive layer is destroyed when the 
insert is subjected to high pressure and high temperature, 
causing the steel strips to separate from one 
another.  
 An insert according to the preamble is known from GB-A-1550616, wherein the 
damping layer consists of a mixture of rubber and a petroleum extract product 
which mixture is coated as a viscous blend onto the metal and sandwiched there 
between. The damping function is provided by vulcanizing the rubber portion 
of the mixture. However, adhesives may be used to impart the adhesion between the mixture and the metal surface.  
 Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle brake 
insert which will solve the problem with the adhesion between damping layer 
and metal without being destroyed at high pressure and high temperature and 
which will also provide effective vibration-and-sound damping. This object is achieved in accordance with the invention with a vehicle brake 
insert which is characterized in that said damping layer is thinner than each 
of said metal plates and consists of a rubber layer which has a structure of a 
sheet being formed by

A vibration-and-noise damping insert for the brakes of automotive vehicles, 
comprising two thin metal plates and a damping layer to be vulcanized enclosed there between, 


characterized in
 that said damping layer is thinner than each 
of said metal plates and consists of a rubber layer which has a structure of a 

sheet being formed by calendering and being subsequently applied onto and vulcanized 
to the two metal plates. 
An insert according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the rubber 
layer is comprised of nitrile rubber. 
An insert according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 that the 
two plates (1, 2) have essentially the same thickness; and in that the thickness 

of the rubber layer is about one-third of the thickness of each plate. 
A method of producing a material web for the manufacture of vehicle 
brake vibration-and-sound damping inserts in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterized 
by
 applying a calendered rubber sheet onto one side of a first 
metal strip (16), coating one side of a second metal strip (18) with an adhesive, 

and passing the two metal strips with the applied rubber sheet facing the coated 
metal strip side through a band vulcanizing machine (19) so as to vulcanize the 

rubber sheeet to the two metal strips.
