<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONCalcium Receptor Active MoleculesRelated ApplicationThis application is a continuation-in-part of Nemeth, et al., entitled Calcium Receptor Active Molecules, filed February 11, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of Nemeth et al., entitled Calcium Receptor Activators, U.S. Serial No. 07/749,451, filed August 23, 1991, the whole of both of which, including drawings, are hereby incorporated herein by reference.Field of the Invention This invention relates to the design, development, composition and use of novel calcimimetic molecules able to act in a manner analogous to extracellular calcium ions on cells, to calcilytic molecules which block the activity of extracellular calcium ions on cells, and to methods for their use and identification.Background of the InventionThe following description provides a summary of information relevant to the present invention. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art to the presently claimed invention, nor that any of the publications specifically or implicitly refer¬ enced are prior art to that invention.Certain cells in the body respond not only to chem¬ ical signals, but also to ions such as extracellular calcium ions (Ca2+) . Changes in the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ (referred to herein as "[Ca2+]") alter the functional responses of these cells. One such spe¬ cialized cell is the parathyroid cell which secretes para¬ thyroid hormone (PTH) . PTH is the principal endocrine factor regulating Ca2+ homeostasis in the blood and extracellular fluids. 

 PTH, by acting on bone and kidney cells, increases the level of Ca2+ in the blood. This increase in [Ca2+] then acts as a negative feedback signal, depressing PTH secretion. The reciprocal relationship between [Ca2+] and PTH secretion forms the essential mechanism maintaining bodily Ca2+ homeostasis.Extracellular Ca2+ acts directly on the parathyroid cell to regulate PTH secretion. The existence of a para¬ thyroid cell surface protein which detects changes in [Ca2+] has been suggested. This protein acts as a receptor for extracellular Ca2+ ("the Ca2+ receptor"), and is sug¬ gested to detect changes in [Ca2+] and to initiate a func¬ tional cellular response, PTH secretion. For example, the role of Ca2+ receptors and extracellular Ca2+ in the regu- lation of intracellular Ca2+ and cell function is reviewed in Nemeth et al., 11 Cell Calcium 319, 1990; the role of Ca2+ receptors in parafollicular and parathyroid cells is discussed in Nemeth, 11 Cell Calcium 323, 1990;
