<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an apparatus and 
method for achieving bit rate distance products on the 

order of 200 Tbits/shm in non-soliton optical 
communication using optical phase conjugation. The 

apparatus and method utilize phase conjugation and 
adjustments of in-line amplifier number, spacing, and/or 

output power in order to compensate for the interaction 
between first order dispersion and fiber nonlinearity 

dispersion effects in an optical fiber span. The present 
invention provides additional techniques for adjusting 

system parameters, such as dispersion-length products of 
first and second portions of the fiber span, in order to 

compensate for changes in first order dispersion resulting 
from non-zero second order dispersion. The method and 

apparatus also provide an improved multi-channel optical 
phase conjugation system design.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
improvements in optical communication systems. More
particularly, the present invention relates to optical
communication systems using optical phase conjugation to
compensate for fiber dispersion.Optical communication typically involves transmitting
high bit rate digital data over silica glass fiber by
modulating a laser or other optical source. Glass fibers
have a very broad bandwidth, on the order of 40,000 THz,
and can therefore in theory support total data rates on
the order of 20,000 Tbits/sec. However, the practical
fiber transmission capability is limited by system
constraints, among the most important of which are the
chromatic dispersion and nonlinearities of the optical
fiber itself. Although optical fiber also attenuates the
transmitted signal, at a rate of about 0.2 dB per km, the
development of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) has
essentially eliminated fiber attenuation as an obstacle to
achieving longer transmission distances.Chromatic dispersion, often simply called dispersion,
refers to a phenomenon in which the speed of an optical
signal through the fiber varies as a function of the
optical signal frequency or wavelength in standard
single-mode fibers. For wavelengths below about 1.3 µm,
longer wavelengths travel faster than shorter ones, and
the resulting dispersion is commonly referred to as
normal. Above 1.3 µm, shorter wavelengths travel faster
than longer ones, and the dispersion is referred to as
anomalous. Dispersion is typically expressed in units of 
picoseconds per kilometernanometer (ps/km-nm), indicating
the number of picoseconds a pulse with a bandwidth of 1
nanometer will spread in time by propagating over 1
kilometer of fiber.One important fiber nonlinearity which can limit
transmission capability is the Kerr effect, in which the
index of refraction increases with the intensity of the
applied optical signal. Changes in the fiber index of
refraction modulate the phase of a signal passing through
the fiber, and thereby impose a frequency chirp which
redistributes the signal frequency spectrum. This
phenomenon is known as self-phase modulation in single
channel systems in which the optical signal modulates
itself. In multi-channel systems, in which one signal
causes modulation of other signals, the phenomenon is
referred to as either cross-phase modulation or
four-photon mixing. Lower frequencies are shifted toward
the leading edge of an optical signal pulse and higher
frequencies are shifted toward the trailing edge. The
