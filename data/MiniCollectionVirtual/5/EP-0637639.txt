<ABSTRACT>
High quality diamond can be produced at high speed 
and at a low cost by a hot-filament assisted CVD 

method. This process comprises using a heating body 
consisting of a metal or metal carbide as an excitation 

source, wherein the heating body has a larger specific 
surface area (surface area/volume) than a filament with 

a circular cross-section for the same cross-sectional 
area. For example, the heating body is composed of a 

bundle of at least two linear heating bodies or at least 
two linear heating bodies twisted around each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
synthesis of diamond by a hot-filament assisted CVD 
method and, more particularly, it is concerned with a 
process for the synthesis of diamond whereby high 
quality diamond can be produced at high speed with a low 
electric power consumption and, therefore, at a low cost. Since the study of the hot-filament assisted CVD 
method by Matsumoto in 1982 (Jpn. J. Appl. Phys.; 21 
1982 L183), the technique for the synthesis of diamond 
has actively been developed and various procedures have 
been studied. Above all, a hot-filament assisted CVD 
method comprising applying an electric current to heat a 
metallic filament or a filament consisting of a 
carburized metallic element and using the filament as an 
excitation source has the advantages that the procedure 
thereof is very simple and enlargement of the area can 
be carried out in a relatively simple manner. In the hot-filament assisted CVD method, a metallic 
filament of tungsten, etc. is heated by applying an 
electric current thereto, a raw material gas containing 
carbon is excited and cracked and diamond is deposited 
in a non-equilibrium state onto a substrate heated at a 
temperature of approximately 800°C and at a pressure 
of at most 105 Pa (1 atm). Fig. 1 is a schematic view showing an example of the 
hot-filament assisted CVD method. In this example, a 
substrate 4 is placed on a substrate supporting base 3 
made of silica in a reactor 2 made of silica provided in 
a furnace 1. A feed gas 5 containing carbon is fed into 
the reactor while evacuating by means of a pump 8 (not 
shown) and heated and excited by a tungsten filament 6 
in order to deposit diamond onto the substrate 4. In 
Fig. 1, 7 corresponds to a thermocouple for measuring 
the temperature.  
 Up to the present time, filaments used for this 
method are either coiled filaments each having a 
circular cross-section ("NEW DIAMOND" Vol. 6, No. 1, 
9-15), or filaments having a plurality of linear 
filaments each having a circular cross section, arranged 
under tension in parallel (Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Publication No. 115576/1991); little consideration, 
however, has been given to the shape of the filament 
itself. With regard to the gaseous phase synthesis of 
diamonds, a number of reports have indicated that atomic 
hydrogen is associated with the formation of diamond and 
the diamond formation mechanism related therewith has 
been reported in a number of papers (e.g. "Appl. Phys. 
Lett." 56 (23) 2298-2300). According to these
