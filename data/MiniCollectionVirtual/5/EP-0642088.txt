<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for containing and supporting electronic 
components includes a first housing portion having a first support, 

and a second housing portion having a second support. The 
apparatus further includes an elastomeric isolating member being 

secured between the first support and the second support so as to 
position the isolating member within the apparatus. Moreover, the 

apparatus further includes a base upon which electronic components 
are mounted, the base being attached to the elastomeric isolating 

member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to electronic devices, and more particularly to
an apparatus for containing and supporting electronic components.Portable computers are becoming increasingly popular. Use of a portable computer
typically involves transporting the computer from a storage site to a remote operating site and
then back to the storage site. With the increase in mobility of the portable computer, there is
an increase in potential for damage to the computer due to mechanical shock inadvertently
applied to the device during its transportation. For example, much damage may be inflicted
upon a portable computer by dropping the computer to the ground from a height of a few feet.An article entitled "Packaging the computer for rough service", published in Electronic
Packaging and Production, vol. 33, no. 9, September 1993, Massachusetts US, pages 30-32,
XP413176, Hoyle describes an apparatus for containing and supporting electronic
components. However, this article does not disclose a housing having first and second
supports for engaging with grooves in opposite sides of an elastomeric support.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new and useful apparatus
for containing and supporting electronic components.According to the invention an apparatus for containing and supporting electronic
components, including a housing, a base upon which electronic components are mounted, an
elastomeric support means positioned within said housing and connected thereto, a portion of
said base being secured to said elastomeric support means is characterised in that said housing
incorporates a first housing portion having a first support and a second housing portion having
a second support, said elastomeric support means incorporating a
first groove in the peripheral edge thereof formed so as to receive a correspondingly shaped
portion of said base, and incorporating a second groove in a first side
thereof, wherein a distal end of said first support is positionable within said second groove, and
incorporating a third groove defined in a second side thereof, wherein a distal end of said second support is
positionable within said third groove.An embodiment of the present invention is described below, by way of example, with
reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of the apparatus for
containing and supporting electronic components which incorporates
the features of the present invention therein;FIG. 2A is a fragmentary perspective view of the

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for containing and supporting electronic components, including a
housing (12), a base (14) upon which electronic components are mounted, an elastomeric

support means (22) positioned within said housing (12) and connected thereto, a portion of
said base (14) being secured to said elastomeric support means (22) is characterised in that said

housing (12) incorporates a first housing portion (16) having a first support (26) and a second
housing portion (18) having a second support (28), said elastomeric support means (22) in
corporating a first groove in the
peripheral edge (32) thereof formed so as to receive a correspondingly shaped portion of said

base (14), and
incorporating a second groove in a first side (34) thereof, wherein a distal end of said first

support (26) is positionable within said second groove, and incorporating a third groove defined in a second
side (36) thereof, wherein a distal end of said second support (28) is positionable within said

third groove.
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that said base (14) incorporates an
aperture (38) therein that exposes an inner edge, said inner edge being positionable within said

first groove in said elastomeric support means (22).
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the first housing portion
(16), the base (14) and the second housing portion (18) all include a correspondingly

positioned bore (31) which receives a locking means (42), so as to lockably connect the first
housing portion (16), the base (14) and the second housing portion (18).
An apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in that the locking means (42) is
formed so as to provide a friction fit in the bore (31) in the elastomeric support means (22).
