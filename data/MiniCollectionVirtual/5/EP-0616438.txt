<ABSTRACT>
A system for communication between sending and receiving systems of a data transmission network comprises a plurality of sending and receiving stations (A, B, C) whose reception lobes are directional lobes all rotating with a synchronous angular speed. A memory in which the pattern of the synchronous rotation and the data relating to the instantaneous locations of the individual stations (A, B, C) are stored is assigned to each station. Two stations communicate only when the rotating directivity pattern (R) of the receiving station is aligned with the sending station.
