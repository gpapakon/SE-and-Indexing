<ABSTRACT>
- The invention relates to a system for storing pressurised fluids, including means (15, Vr) for the inlet of fluid into the system and for controlling its pressure, several containers (2, 3, 4) including at least one inlet orifice (10), and lines (5, 6, 7) for transferring the said fluid, the said lines connecting the inlet and control means to at least one of the inlet orifices (10) of the said containers. The inlet and control means (Vr) are designed simultaneously, during at least part of the filling process, to allow the fluid to pass freely between the said inlet and control means and at least two containers. - The containers are short lightweight reinforced tubular structures. The device includes an auxiliary container (43) which can store the hydrocarbon coming from one of the containers.

A storage and delivery system for pressurised
fluids, such as gaseous hydrocarbons, designed to

supply the engine of a motor vehicle, composed of
several containers (2, 3, 4; 32, 33, 34) having at

least one inlet orifice (10), inlet and control means
for distributing the pressurised fluid within the

system (15, Vr; 23, V1, V2), transfer lines for the

pressurised fluid (5, 6, 7; 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30; 36,
37, 38, 39, 40, 41), said transfer lines connecting the

inlet and control means to at least one of the inlet
orifices (10) of said containers, characterised in

that:

said containers have a cylindrical portion with
two ends, said cylindrical area being an internal

corrugated sheath (16) in which the hollow
portions of said corrugations are fitted with a

reinforcing element (17), and
said inlet and control means (Vr; V1, V2) are
designed to allow, simultaneously and during some

of the operation whereby the containers are filled
with pressurised fluid, a free passage for the

pressurised fluid between the inlet and control
means and at least two containers.
A storage system as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that said transfer lines (5, 6, 7; 25,

26, 27, 28, 29, 30; 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41) have at
least one means for controlling (V) the passage of said

pressurised fluid.
A system as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that it has at least one device (14) for controlling

and monitoring the passage of said pressurised fluid
between said inlet and control means and at least two

containers. 
A system as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that said reinforcing element (17) is a

circumferential reinforcement made from a resin
strengthened with fibres such as glass fibres or carbon

fibres.
A system as claimed in one of claims 1 or 4,
characterised in that a container has longitudinal

tensile strengthening means (12) placed over the entire
container except for the openings of said container,

said openings being located at one of the ends at least
of the cylindrical area.
A system as claimed in 1, characterised in
that the sheath is in metal.
A system as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that the sheath is made from a thermoplastic

material.
A system as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that the sheath is made from high density

polyethylene.
A system as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that the sheath is made from polyamide.
A system as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the sheath is made from

polyvinylidene fluoride.
A system as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that it has at least one auxiliary

safety container allowing pressurised fluids escaping
from at least one of the containers to be collected.
A system as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that said containers are disposed in

superimposed layers in a staggered effect, the
containers being offset from one another.
A system as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the set of containers is placed

in a casing and the space left between said casing and 
the containers is filled with a foam material such as

polyurethane.
Use of the system as claimed in one of the
preceding claims as a container for pressurised natural

gas disposed on the roof of a utility vehicle for the
purposes of public transport or freight transport.
