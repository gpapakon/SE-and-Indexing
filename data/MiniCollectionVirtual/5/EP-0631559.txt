Closure for a container, comprising a lower 
closure portion (20) and a screw cap (10), wherein the 

lower closure portion (20) is connectable to the 
container opening by means of a bottom part (21) and 

includes a pouring spout (23), which communicates with 
the bottom part (21) of the lower closure portion (20) 

by means of a resilient, extensible bellows (22), and 
wherein the screw cap (10), together with cap base (12) 

and cap casing (11) which is provided with an internal 
thread, can be screwed on and off the pouring spout 

(23), which is provided with an external thread, 
characterised in that the pouring spout (23) of the 

lower closure portion (20) has at least one locking cam 
(26) externally of the external thread (24) in the 

transitional region facing the bellows (22), which cam 
has a flat leading edge (27) in the screw-on direction 

and passes into a steep detent edge (28), in that the 
cap casing (11) is located with the locking cam (26) in 

the screw-on end position and prevents the screw cap 
(10) from unscrewing, and in that the locking connection 

between screw cap (10) and pouring spout (23) can be 
discontinued by compressing the bellows (22) in the 

region of the locking cam (26), and the screw cap (10) 
can be exposed so as to be unscrewed. 
Closure according to claim 1, characterised in 
that two locking cams (26) are provided, which are 

formed to fit diametrically on the pouring spout (23). 
Closure according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the cap casing (11) for each 

locking cam (26) includes at least one locking receiver 
(15), which is configured as an axially orientated 

recess in the free end region of the cap casing (11).  
 
Closure according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the cap casing (11) includes locking receivers (15) 

and locking lugs (14) alternately at the peripheral edge 
with uniform spacings therebetween. 
Closure according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the locking receivers (15) have a portal-like 

cross-section and include a width which corresponds to 
the width of the locking lugs (14). 
Closure according to one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the walls defining the locking 

receivers (15) are radially orientated in the cap casing 
(11). 
Closure according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that, when the screw cap (10) is in its 

screw-on end position, the locking receivers (15) of the 
cap casing (11) extend at least over a portion of the 

axial dimension of the locking cams (26). 
Closure according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the width of the locking receivers 

(15) corresponds substantially to the mean peripheral 
dimension of the locking cams (26). 
Closure according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the regions of the bellows (22) to 

be deformed are provided with an additional marking.
