<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce a directional antenna which is superior to those of the prior art, and especially a dipole antenna which is easier to manufacture and of simpler design, and also has enhanced electrical properties, the dipole with its circuit balancing element (7) according to the invention is made of the material of the reflector (5). The dipole and the circuit balancing element (7) project from the reflector wall (5) through corresponding areas which are cut out and/or punched out, up to a region (11) where they join with the remaining material of the reflector wall (5), and are preferably bent outwardly in relation to the plane of the reflector wall in the region of the point (11) where they immediately join with the remaining material of the reflector wall (5).
