<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to
a process for preparing
stabilized, partially-dehydrated
aromatic herbs which exhibit the color, flavor
aroma and overall appearance comparable to that of the
freshly-chopped plant.In the frozen food field, attempts have been made to
package fresh, edible plant products, such as herb, fresh
fruit and fresh vegetable products so that the desirable
qualities of the fresh products are maintained. In
particular, the art has recognized the desirability of
preparing a product that would maintain quality, flowability
and easy handling characteristics for long periods of time at
frozen temperatures as well as when the product is repeatedly
thawed and refrozen or when the product is left in a
refrigerated state (approximately 40°F or about 4-5°C) for
several days or longer. In particular, the art has recognized
the desirability of preparing a product that would maintain
quality, consistent supply, easy handling characteristics and
portion control year round thus enabling food producers, food
merchants, or restaurants to stock such product, in
particular, the aromatic products for sale to consumers while
reducing losses due to spoilage, waste or deterioration.
Since many of the edible plant products including herbs,
fruits and vegetables valued for use in foods are, for
climatic reasons, generally only available regionally and/or
seasonally, the art has recognized a need for products that
could be pre-processed to eliminate waste, stored in a frozen
state to preserve fresh flavor, color and overall appearance, 
and also maintain flowability and ease of handling in the
frozen state.In many of these products some of the properties that
cause consumers to value the fresh character of these food
products are difficult to maintain for extended periods. This
problem is especially acute with fresh leafy plants which
often may contain their flavor and aroma components in
discrete oil or flavor glands. Such plants are typically
classified as herbs, sometimes more particularly as aromatic
herbs. Accordingly, it would be desirable to preserve the
color, flavor, aroma and overall natural or comminuted
appearance of fresh herbs without resorting to chemical
additives, special types of packaging or packaging equipment
while providing an extended shelf-life for the packaged
product. The technique of freezing plant products has been
utilized for many years as a method of preserving fresh
character, flavor and appearance. However, inherent enzymatic
activity in biological materials which is

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a frozen herb product comprising :

a. introducing the herb into an infusion bath comprising 20 to 70 % by
weight of an osmotic agent at a temperature of at least about 82.22°C (180°F)

for a time sufficient to reduce the water activity coefficient of the herb to below
about 0.97 and cause infusion of the osmotic agent into the herb ; and
b. subsequently freezing the infused herb.
The process of claim 1, wherein the osmotic agent is selected from the
group consisting of high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, glucose, maltose and

hydrogenated corn syrup.
The process of claim 1, wherein the osmotic agent is selected from the
group consisting of corn syrup having a D. E. above about 62, glucose,

fructose, sucrose and mixtures thereof.
The process of claim 1, wherein the osmotic agent is high fructose
corn syrup.
The process of claim 1, wherein after the osmotic agent has been
infused into the herb, the herb is subjected to an additional drying step before

the infused herb is frozen.
The process of claim 1, wherein said temperature of said infusion bath
is from about 82.22°C (180°F) to about 107.22°C (225°F).
The process of claim 1, wherein said temperature of said infusion bath
is from about 87.72°C (190°F) to about 98.88°C (210°F).
The process of claim 1, wherein said infusion bath comprises 40 to
70 % by weight of said osmotic agent.
The process of claim 1, wherein said infusion bath comprises 50 to
70 % by weight of said osmotic agent.
The process of claim 1, wherein said herb is selected from the group
consisting of basil, dill weed, parsley, oregano, marjoram, sage, thyme,

rosemary, mint, cilantro, tarragon, chervil, and genetic variations thereof.
The process of claim 1, wherein said herb is selected from the group
consisting of basil, cilantro, and mint. 
The process of claim 1, wherein said herb is basil.
The process of claim 1, wherein said herb is cilantro.
The process of claim 1, wherein said herb is mint.
The process of claim 1, wherein said time in the introducing step is
from 20 seconds to 10 minutes.
The process of claim 1, wherein said time in the introducing step is
from about 2 minutes to about 5 minutes.
The process of anyone of claims 1 to 16, wherein the water activity
coefficient of the herb is from about 0.55 to about 0.97.
