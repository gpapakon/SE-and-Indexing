<ABSTRACT>
An electric system of an electric vehicle 
including a main battery (1) as a power supply, and 

a semiconductor power converter (4) for driving a 
wheel driving motor. Impact destroying switches 

(301 - 304) are inserted into connecting lines (201 
and 203) which connect a main battery (1) to the 

semiconductor power converter (4), and into a 
connecting line (202) connecting main battery blocks 

(110) and (120). Each impact destroying switch 
breaks its conduction by blasting an explosive in 

the switch in response to the impact due to a 
collision of the vehicle body. In case of an 

emergency such as a collision, since the main 
battery is instantaneously disconnected from the 

connecting lines by the switches, the connecting 
lines become free from the voltage. This makes it 

possible to prevent fire, and to cut off the vehicle 
body to save passengers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric 
system of an electric vehicle, which includes a 
battery as a power supply and an inverter driving an 
AC motor for driving wheels. Fig. 1 shows a conventional driving system of an 
electric vehicle such as disclosed in EP-A-0 530 717. 
It has a battery as a power 
supply, and an inverter driving an AC motor which in 
turn drives wheels. In this figure, the reference 
numeral 1 designates a main battery consisting of a 
number of serially connected unit cells 100. The 
reference numeral 4 designates an inverter that 
drives an AC motor 5 for driving wheels. The 
reference numeral 3 designates a protective fuse 
employed as needed. The reference numeral 2 
designates a main switch for electrically connecting 
or disconnecting the inverter 4 with the main 
battery 1. The output axis of the motor 5 is 
coupled to a differential gear 7 via a reduction 
gear 6, and drives wheels 81 and 82. In an existing electric vehicle, the ratio of 
the weight and space of the main battery is greatest 
among those of the devices of the vehicle. For this 
reason, the main battery is separately mounted on  
 
the vehicle considering weight balance and effective 
utilization of space of the vehicle. In Fig. 1, the main battery 1 is divided into 
two main battery blocks 110 and 120. Fig. 2 shows the devices of Fig. 1 mounted on 
the vehicle. The main battery blocks 110 and 120 
are disposed at the front and rear portions of the 
body 10, respectively. Accordingly, it is necessary to connect the main 
battery block 110 with the main battery block 120 
and the inverter 4 through connecting lines 201 and 
202. Thus, the connecting lines 201 and 202 
longitudinally pass through the center of the body 
10. In the conventional electric system, the main 
battery 1 is disconnected, in a normal mode, from 
the main circuit with the main switch 2. The 
disconnection may also be achieved with the 
protective fuse 3 in case of failure of the main 
circuit. Fig. 3 shows another method for disconnecting 
the main battery block 110 from the main battery 
block 120. In Fig. 3, the main switch 2 of Fig. 1 
is divided into four switches 21 - 24 to carry out 
disconnection. This method, however, presents a problem in that 
not only spaces for mounting the switches 21 - 24 
but also cost of devices will increase compared with 
the system of Fig. 1. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide an electric system of an 
electric vehicle which ensures safety of the vehicle 
in case of
