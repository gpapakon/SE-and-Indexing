<ABSTRACT>
A lock is provided for locking two doors (106, 108) of an engine thrust 
reverser. The lock is a back-up lock and is normally not subjected to 

load when the thrust reversers (106, 108) are in a stowed position. The 
lock is inhibited from unlocking in the event that the lock becomes 

subjected to a force from the door acting in a door opening direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lock for use with an engine thrust 
reverser. Thrust reverser systems act to direct the thrust produced by an aero-engine 
in a forward direction so as to decelerate an aircraft. One type of 
thrust reverser system for a fan engine comprises a plurality of doors 1 
arranged around the periphery of an engine 2, as shown in Figure 1 of 
the accompanying drawings. The engine shown in Figure 1 has four 
such doors, two of which are shown. Figure 2 shows the doors 1 in the open position. Each door is operated 
by an associated hydraulic actuator 3. In the open position one part of 
the door extends outwardly to direct gas flow from the engine in a 
forward direction and another part of the door extends inwardly to 
impede the gas flow to the rear of the engine. It is known to provide back-up locks to prevent accidental deployment of 
the thrust reversers. One such arrangement is described in EP 
93305513.9, published as EP-A-0 580 352. According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a lock for 
an engine thrust reverser, comprising a first locking element movable 
between a first position for preventing deployment of a first thrust 
reversing member and a second position corresponding to deployment of 
the first thrust reversing member, a second locking element movable 
between a first position for preventing deployment of a second thrust 
reversing member and a second position corresponding to deployment of  
 
the second thrust reversing member, a third locking element movable 
between first and second positions for preventing and permitting, 
respectively, movement of the first and second locking elements from the 
first positions to the second positions thereof, and an electromechanical 
actuator for moving the third locking element from the first position to 
the second position thereof. Preferably the third locking element is biased towards the first position 
thereof. Preferably the first and second locking elements are biased 
towards the second positions thereof. The first and second thrust reversing members may be doors provided on 
an engine for redirecting a flow of gas from the engine. Preferably each of the first and second locking elements is a fork 
pivotable between the first and second positions thereof. Preferably, 
each fork is urged towards the respective second position by a torsion 
spring. Preferably each of the first and second locking elements is arranged to 
engage a respective closure pin or lip secured to or integral with the 
res

A lock for an engine thrust reverser, comprising a first locking 
element (102) movable between a first position for preventing 

deployment of a first thrust reversing member (106) and a second 
position corresponding to deployment of the first thrust reversing 

member (106), characterised by a second locking element (104) movable 
between a first position for preventing deployment of a second thrust 

reversing member (108) and a second position corresponding to 
deployment of the second thrust reversing member (108), a third locking 

element (138) movable between first and second positions for preventing 
and permitting, respectively, movement of the first and second locking 

elements (102, 104) from the first positions to the second positions 
thereof, and an electromechanical actuator (140) for moving the third 

locking element (138) from the first position to the second position 
thereof. 
A lock as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the third 
locking element (138) is biased towards its first position. 
A lock as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the first 
and second locking elements (102, 104) are biased towards their 

respective second positions. 
A lock as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that each of the 
first and second locking elements (102, 104) is a fork pivotable between 

the first and second positions thereof, each fork being urged towards its 
 

respective second position by a torsion spring. 
A lock as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that each of the first and second locking elements (102, 

104) is arranged to engage a respective closure pin (150, 154) or lip 
secured to or integral with the respective thrust reversing member (106, 

108). 
A lock as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that no force is applied to the first and second locking 

elements (102, 104) from the respective thrust reversing member (106, 
108) so as to urge the locking elements towards their respective second 

positions when the thrust reversing members are at inoperative positions. 
A lock as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the lock is inhibited from unlocking upon 

application of a force to either of the first and second locking elements 
(102, 104) by the thrust reversing members (106, 108) acting to urge 

either of the first and second locking elements (102, 104) towards their 
respective second positions. 
A lock as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the electromechanical actuator is a solenoid (140). 
A lock as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the third locking element (138) comprises a locking 

pin for selectively engaging and disengaging respective actuating rods 
(134, 152) movable with the respective first and second locking elements 

(102, 104). 
An engine thrust reverser comprising at least two thrust 
reversing members (1; 106, 108) and a plurality of locks for locking each 

thrust reversing member (106, 108) at an inoperative position, 
characterised in that at least one of the locks is a lock as claimed in any 

one of the preceding claims. 
An engine thrust reverser as claimed in Claim 10, characterised 
in that each lock as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 9 is not subjected 

to a load when the thrust reversing members are at their inoperative 
positions and the or each other lock is locked to secure the thrust 

reversing members. 
An engine thrust reverser as claimed in Claim 11, characterised 
in that the locks engage the respective thrust reversing members at 

respective different positions.
