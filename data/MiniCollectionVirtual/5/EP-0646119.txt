<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel quaternary nitrogen-containing
phosphonate compounds, including bisphosphonates,
phosphonoalkylphosphinates, phosphonocarboxylates, and
phosphonosulfonates, preferably bisphosphonates and
phosphonoalkylphosphinates. This invention also relates to
pharmaceutical compositions containing these novel compounds as
well as to a use of these compounds for treating or preventing certain metabolic
bone disorders characterized by abnormal calcium and phosphate
metabolism. Specifically this invention relates
to a use of the compounds or compositions of the present invention for treating or preventing osteoporosis and arthritis,
especially rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compoitions
containing these novel compounds as well as to a use of such compounds
for treating or preventing dental calculus, plaque, and gingivitis. A number of pathological conditions which can afflict warm-blooded
animals involves abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism.
Such conditions may be divided into two broad categories.
1. Conditions which are characterized by anomalous mobilization
of calcium and phosphate leading to general or
specific bone loss, such as osteoporosis and Paget's
disease, or excessively high calcium and phosphate levels in
the fluids of the body, such as hypercalcemia of tumor
origin. Such conditions are sometimes referred to herein as
pathological hard tissue demineralizations.2. Conditions which cause or result from deposition of
calcium and phosphate anomalously in the body, such as
arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis. These conditions are sometimes referred to
herein as pathological calcifications.The first category includes the most common metabolic bone
disorder, osteoporosis; osteoporosis is a condition in which bone
hard tissue is lost disproportionately to the development of new
hard tissue. Osteoporosis can be generally defined as the
reduction in the quantity of bone, or the atrophy of skeletal
tissue. Marrow and bone spaces become larger, fibrous binding
decreases, and compact bone becomes fragile. Osteoporosis can be
subclassified as menopausal, senile, drug-induced (e.g.
adrenocorticoid, as can occur in steroid therapy);
disease-induced (arthritic and tumor), etc.; however, the
manifestations are essentially the same. In general, there are
two types of osteoporosis: primary and secondary. "Secondary
osteoporosis" is the result of a separate identifiable disease
process or agent. However,
