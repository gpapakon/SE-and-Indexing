<ABSTRACT>
A method for quantitation of blood parameters comprises the steps provision of a sample of plasma, serum or blood, entering the sample into a cuvette with an internal dimension less than 1 mm, illuminating the sample by a light source, measuring and recording the changes of light properties caused by the sample as a function of time, calculating parameters of the recorded light signal/time curve such as slopes, extreme values, and the time distance between such extreme values, and interpreting the parameters as blood parameters. For the measurements an apparatus is used comprising a cuvette (16, 17) with an internal dimension less than 1 mm, a light source (7, 9), means (8, 10) for measuring currently a light signal from the sample, means for recording the measured light signal values, and means for calculating parameters of the thereby defined light signal versus time graph.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to quantitation of blood parameters by a measuring
performed on a sample of plasma, serum or whole blood.The provision of a blood sample for quantitation of various blood parameters is
a routine by many medical investigations. Commonly, a sample of some ml is taken and sent
to a laboratory where the relevant parameters such as coagulation time, haematocrit,
sedimentation rate, haemoglobin percentage, etc are quantified.To obtain a sample of some ml it is necessary to pass a cannula into a vein to
make the necessary amount of blood flow into a vessel. The vessel must then be carefully
labelled and sent to the laboratory wherefrom the determined data will issue later.By this procedure the blood sample when taken must be added an
anticoagulant to prevent the blood from coagulating on its way to the laboratory. In the
laboratory the effect of the anticoagulant is neutralized to make the sample equate a sample of
fresh blood.It is wanted to provide a method and an apparatus making it possible to decide
the relevant parameters on the basis of fresh blood, the measuring beginning practically at the
very moment the blood sample leaves the patient's body and being ended about 30 minutes
later. The apparatus should be handy and portable to an extent making it possible to allocate
the apparatus to the patient so that the blood sample may be passed into the apparatus, which
may then be placed at the bedside until the result is ready. Further, the method should make it
possible to perform the measurement on a blood sample which may be provided by simply
pricking a finger or an earlobe to obtain a sample not larger than 25 Âµl, i.e. a sample which
could be provided without help from a professional to puncture a vein.A method of measuring the coagulation time for a blood sample is known from
WO 89/06803, which method comprises the steps of entering the sample into a capillary
element and measuring the coagulation time as the time elapsing from the moment when the
blood sample enters the photometer measuring the translucence, which moment is indicated
by a sudden fall of the translucence, until the moment when the translucence reaches a
maximum after this sudden fall.However, it has appeared that the development of the properties of light passing
through or being scattered or reflected by a blood sample beyond the time of the occurrence of 
the first translucence maximum reveals interesting information of other relevant blood
parameters.A method for quantitation a number of blood parameters by one

A method for quantitation a number of blood parameters by one measuring

into a cuvette with an internal dimension less than 1 mm and illuminated by a light source,
characterised in that the intensity of light transmitted, deflected or scattered by the sample as a

function of time is measured and obtained connected light signal values and times are stored
to obtain a light signal versus time recording on the basis of which are calculated parameters

which in addition to definition of the coagulation time can be used as an expression for one or
more of the blood parameters: sedimentation rate, haematocrit, fibrinogen concentration,

platelet related coagulation activity, activity of the fibrinolytic system, rate of fibrin degeneration,
amount of fibrinogen, and the original fibrinogen concentration.

extreme value of the signal/time function caused by the introduction of the sample into the

cuvette is interpreted as the starting moment for the measurement.

moment when the light signal value passes a set value differing by a predetermined amount
from this third extreme value when approaching this value, until a moment when the light signal

value again passes this set value after having passed the third extreme value, and this
calculated time is taken as an expression of the activity of the fibrinolytic system.
