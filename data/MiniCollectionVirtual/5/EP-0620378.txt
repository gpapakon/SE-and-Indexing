<ABSTRACT>
A hydrodynamic clutch which has its piston (16) moved by 
the difference of the pressure in two oil chambers (18,19) at 

the two sides of the piston (16) while shutting the communication 
between the two oil chambers (18,19) with a friction 

member (17) adhered to either of the piston (16) or a front 
cover (12) to be engaged by the piston. An annular groove (20) 

for communicating with such one of the two oil chambers (18,19) 
as will take a lower pressure when the clutch is 

applied is formed in the surface, to which the friction 
member (17) is adhered, and/or the adhered surface of 

the friction member (17) itself, to reduce the pressure acting 
to return the piston (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wet type 
clutch according to the preamble of claim 1. This kind of clutch is made to effect torque 
transmission by bringing a friction member and a frictional 
surface facing the friction member into facial 
contact with each other. In a known torque transmission 
system for forcing the friction member and the 
frictional surface in to contact, the friction member 
adheres either to a piston or to the surface facing the 
piston, and the frictional surface is exemplified by 
the surface facing the friction member, so that the 
piston is moved forward to engage with that surface. 
In this system, the piston itself acts as a torque 
transmission member, as exemplified in a lockup clutch 
of a torque converter. From reference US-A-5 103 947 a generic wet type clutch is 
known. The object thereof is to be quiet in operation. This can 
be achieved by engaging/disengaging a piston with/from a front 
cover, so that a first clutch engages/disengages a turbine runner 
of the clutch. Figs. 16 and 17 show a torque converter 1 which 
is equipped with a lockup clutch of the prior art. 
This torque converter 1 is  
  
 
liquid-tight by means of a front cover 2 and a shell 3a of the 
pump impeller 3 and is filled up with a fluid. The 
torque converter 1 is arranged with a turbine runner 
4, a stator 5, and a piston 6 of the lockup clutch. 
A porous 
friction member 7 which is formed into an annular 
shape having a constant width is adhered 
to a surface of the piston 6 which is located at the 
circumferential edge portion and faces the inner surface 
of the front cover 2. At the two sides of the piston 6, 
a first oil chamber 8 is formed at the side of 
the front cover 2 and a second oil chamber 9 is formed at the 
side of the turbine runner 4. In case the lockup 
clutch is to be applied, the fluid is fed to the second 
oil chamber 9 and discharged from the first oil 
chamber 8. As a result, the internal pressure in the 
second oil chamber 9 exceeds that in the first oil 
chamber 8 so that the piston 6 is pushed toward the 
front cover 2 to bring its friction member 7 into contact 
with the front cover 2 while shutting the communication 
between the first oil chamber 8 and the 
second oil chamber 9 by that friction member 7. As a 
result, leakage of the fluid from the second oil chamber 
9 to the first oil chamber 8 is substantially eliminated 
to establish a large pressure difference between 
the two oil chambers 8 and 9 so that the friction  
 
member 7 of the piston 6 is pushed
