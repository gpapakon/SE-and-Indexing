<ABSTRACT>
Different tracks on an optical information 
recording medium is irradiated with first and second 

light spots for auto tracking. The light of the first 
light spot via the recording medium is detected to 

produce a first detection signal and light of the 
second light spot via the recording medium is also 

detected to produce a second detection signal. On the 
basis of a difference between the first and second 

detection signals, a signal used for performing 
tracking control of a third light spot for recording or 

reproducing information is generated. When recording 
or reproduction of information is effected on/from one 

of a first recording medium having a track pitch P₁ and 

a second recording medium having a track pitch P₂ and 
the first and second recording media satisfy a relation 

P₁ - P₂ = d (d is the width of the tracking track) while 
executing auto-tracking control, a relationship of a 

direction of movement of the third light spot in a 
track intersecting direction with respect to a polarity 

of a signal obtained by subtracting the second 
detection signal from the first detection signal 

between the first and second recording media is 
inverted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
information recording/reproduction method and apparatus
for recording/reproducing information by irradiating a
light beam onto an optical information recording medium
and, more particularly, to an optical information
recording/reproduction method and apparatus for
performing auto-tracking control using a 3-beam method.As information recording media for
recording/reproducing information using light, various
types of media such as disk-shaped media, card-shaped
media, tape-shaped media, and the like are known. Some
of these optical information recording media allow both
recording and reproduction and some other allow only
reproduction. Information is recorded on a recordable
medium by scanning an information track with a light
beam which is modulated according to recording
information and is focused to a small spot shape. In
this case, information is recorded as an optically
detectable information bit string.Information is reproduced from a recording medium
by scanning the information bit string on the 
information track with a light beam spot of a constant
power which does not allow recording on the medium, and
by detecting light reflected by or transmitted through
the medium.An optical head used for recording/reproducing
information on/from a recording medium is movable
relative to the recording medium in the information
track direction of the medium and a direction
intersecting the information track direction. Upon
movement of the optical head, a light beam spot is
scanned on an information track. As a lens for
focusing a light beam spot in the optical head, for
example, an objective lens is used. The objective lens
is held by an optical head main body to be
independently movable in its optical axis direction
(focusing direction) and a direction (tracking
direction) perpendicular to both the optical axis
direction and the information track direction of the
recording medium. The objective lens is normally held
via an elastic member, and the movement of the
objective lens in the two directions is normally
attained by an actuator which utilizes a magnetic
interaction.Of the above-mentioned optical information
recording media, a card-shaped optical information
recording medium (to be referred to as an optical card
hereinafter) is compact and light in weight, and large 
demand is expected in the future as portable,
relatively large-capacity information recording media.Fig. 1 is a plan view of a write-once type optical
card, and Fig. 2 is a partial enlarged view
