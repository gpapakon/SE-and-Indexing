<ABSTRACT>
In a cellular mobile telecommunications system, a 
radio link control method provides each base station with 

an antenna whose directivity is adaptively controllable 
on a mobile station basis. The base station communicates 

with a plurality of mobile stations by using the same 
frequency at the same time. The base station selects, 

among transmitters/receivers thereof which are in 
communication, two transmitters/receivers using the 

same frequency, detects the main beam directions of 
antenna directivities thereof, and then compares a 

difference between the main beam directions and a 
predetermined threshold. If the former is smaller 

than the latter, the base station executes handover 
so as to replace the frequency being used by one of the 

transmitters/receivers with another frequency. The method 
allows a single base station to use the same frequency 

twice or more while preventing interference from occurring 
within the base station. Alternatively or in addition 

the base station assigns or reassigns potentially 
interfering frequencies so as to maintain the angular 

velocities of the main beam directions the same or similar.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cellular mobile
telecommunications system and, more particularly, to a
radio link control method capable of adaptively controlling
the directivity of an antenna of a base station on a mobile
station basis and thereby allowing the base station and
a plurality of mobile stations to communicate at the
same time over channels of the same frequency or nearby
frequencies which are apt to interfere with each other.A car telephone system or similar large capacity
mobile radio telecommunications system having a plurality
of base stations each covering a respective service area
is conventional and generally referred to as a cellular
telecommunications system. This kind of system allows
the same frequency to be repeatedly used between base
stations which are free from interference, thereby
promoting the effective use of limited frequencies.
A cellular telecommunications system is provided with
either an omni architecture or a sector architecture,
as well known in the art. In the omni architecture, a 
single non-directional antenna is installed in each base
station while, in the sector architecture, a plurality
of directional antennas are installed in a single base
station. Today, the sector architecture is predominant
over the omni architecture since it can reduce the size
of a service area, i.e., cell size and can enhance the
efficient use of frequencies in space without increasing
the number of base stations.Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 62-92630,
for example, discloses a cellular telecommunications
system having the sector configuration and capable of
promoting the efficient use of frequencies. In this system,
a base station is provided with an antenna having a high
front-to-back ratio (ratio of a forward radiation level
to a backward radiation level in a directional antenna).
Such a base station allows different sector cells thereof
to reuse the same frequency.It has been reported that adaptively controlling
directivity in matching relation to the state of a mobile
station is advantageous over using a base station antenna
having fixed directivity. A method of controlling antenna
directivity in a horizontal plane is taught in, for example,
a paper entitled "Improving Frequency Utilization Radio by
Controlling Antenna Directivity of Cellular Base Station",
the Institute of Electronic Data Communication Engineers
of Japan, Spring Convention, Fascicle No. 2, B-397, page 
2-398, April 1993. The method taught in this paper uses
a base station antenna implemented as a
