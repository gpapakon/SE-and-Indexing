<ABSTRACT>
A pedal lock anti-theft device for cars comprising two superimposed members, the upper member being formed of a cross bar or anchoring plate (10) provided with two slots (12) in which the shanks or levers of brake and clutch pedals are inserted, and the lower member being a second plate (11) rotatably mounted about a central shaft (16) received in a sleeve (17) integral with the upper plate (10) and provided at its upper end with a control handle (22) cooperating with a steeled padlock (25) and controlling the rotation of the lower plate (11) from a locked position, in which the lower plate is disposed under the pedals, to an opening or loosening position, in which said lower plate is parallel to the shanks of the pedals so as to allow the anti-theft device to be released after the opening of the steeled padlock.

<DESCRIPTION>
IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO PEDAL LOCK ANIT-THEFT DEVICES FOR CARSThe present invention relates to the field of the anti- theft devices for cars.Anti-thefts can be divided at the present state of art into two large classes: electronic and mechanical anti- thefts. The first class includes the anti-thefts operating in the electrical equipment of the car in order to avoid the entry and/or the start of the engine with simultaneous optic and/or acoustic alarm signal. Such anti-thefts are very complex, expensive, and sometimes fall short of designers' and manufacturers' expectations as it is subject to frequent false alarms and failures which can also cause troubles or damages to the electrical equipment of the vehicles. Among the mechanical anti-thefts which can be of several types there are known the socalled "pedal-locks" aiming at preventing the illegitimate controls of the vehicle by locking brake and clutch pedals. Since such anti-theft device should be applied at the bottom near the floor of the vehicle, the handling thereof is in many cases rather troublesome.The aim of the present invention is of providing a very reliable pedal lock anti-theft device which can be easily used.According to the invention there is provided a pedal lock anti-theft device formed of two locking plates rotatably connected to a vertical shaft integral with one plate and 

provided with a control knob or handle which is located at the top in an easily accessible position and intended to provide for opening or locking such plates in cooperation with a steeled pin padlock. Still according to the invention such locking plates are formed of lower and upper members, the lower member being integral with the control shaft, and the upper member is provided with a pair of slots intended to receive the shanks of the two pedals and carries an axially superimposed sleeve in which such control shaft rotates a well as a C-shaped casing in which the steeled padlock is received, said padlock being provided with a pin engaging to a diametrical hole formed in said shaft and preventing the latter from rotating.The invention will now be described with reference to the annexed drawings which show by way of an illustrative, non-limitative example a preferred embodiment of the invention. In the drawings:Fig. 1 shows the pedal lock in the closure position with the padlock removed away for clarity purposes.Fig. 2 is a view similar to Fig. 1 but provided with padlock.Fig. 3 shows the unlocking position allowing the anti- theft to be removed.

Claims
1. A pedal lock anti-theft device for cars wherein it includes a pair of locking members (10, 11) rotatably connected by a vertical control shaft (16) defining two positions of said members, i.e. an engaged and disengaged positions, respectively.
2. The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that said locking members (10, 11) are formed of two plates, the upper plate (10) carrying a pair of slots (12) intended to receive the shanks or levers of the pedals, and the lower plate (11) being capable of rotating under control with respect to the first plate, so as to take on a locking position in which both plates have a mating side, as well as a loosening position in which the lower plate (11) is rotated by 90° to the other plate so as to allow the whole assembly to be released.
3. The device as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in that said control shaft (16) is located vertically, is integral with the lower plate (11) , and is pivotally connected to a sleeve (17) carried by the upper plate (10).
4. The device as claimed in claims 1 to 3 , characterized in that control shaft (16) carries at the upper end a control handle (22) located in a comfortable position for the driver, and terminates at the base in an adjustable foot (18) to adjust the height of the locking plates (10, 


11) to the position of the car pedals.
5. The device as claimed in claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the upper plate (10) carries a second adjustable foot (19) and a casing (20) for a steeled padlock (25) provided with extractable pin and safety lock (27) .
6. The device as claimed in claims 1 to 5, characterized in that control shaft (16) crosses said casing (20) and is provided with a calibrated diametrical bore (21) formed in a position corresponding to the pin (26) of the padlock.
7. The device as claimed in claim 1 to 6, characterized in that the rotation by 90° of control shaft (16) from the locked position to the loosen position and vice versa is defined by a pair of stops formed of a dowel (23) integral with shaft (16) and a stake (24) integral with the casing (20) of the padlock.
