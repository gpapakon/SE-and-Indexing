<ABSTRACT>
A dual function readhead for a reflectance instrument is located in a 
housing (10) for the instrument. A first light source (14) for emitting 

radiation for reflectance readings and optically transmitting data is 
mounted in the readhead (10). In addition, a first photodetector (20) is 

mounted in the readhead (10) for detecting or receiving reflectance 
readings. A format or interface access port is defined in the readhead. 

An interface (12) is provided that includes a second photodetector (28) 
for detecting data optically transmitted by the first light source (14). 

Means (32) are also provided for decoding data received by the second 
photodetector (28). A second light source may also be included with the 

interface for transmitting commands or data to the first photodetector. 
Software for controlling the operation of the first light source and the 

first photodetector is also provided. 
The instrument may be used to measure analyte levels, e.g. glucose, 
cholestorol in whole blood. 
There might be an access slot in which a test strip with blood 
applied to one or more pads is inserted during reflection measurement 

and the interface (12) for optical data transfer is inserted during data 
transfer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new and improved reflectance instrument; and,
more particularly, to a new and improved dual function optical readhead for photometric
measurements of diffuse reflectance and/or full-duplex communication with peripheral
devices.Whole blood glucose test strips have been used for many years by hospitals,
doctors, and individual patients for monitoring glucose levels in patients' blood to
determine the stages or status of diabetes and other ailments (EP-A-387630). The whole blood glucose
test strips are used with a reflectance instrument or meter and a work station or other
data processing equipment. Tests are conducted using the instrument, and the test
results can be stored in a memory in the instrument along with time, date, patient
information and operator information. Periodically, the test results are transmitted by a
hard wire connection to the work station or the data processing equipment for
processing.Typically, a test is conducted by inserting a reacted test strip into a slot or access
port in the instrument. Light from a light emitting diode in the instrument is directed at
the reacted test strip. The light is then reflected back to a photodetector also in the 
instrument, and the reflected light is measured. The instrument includes software that
converts the amount of measured reflected light to units of blood glucose by means of an
algorithm.A typical use of the reflectance instrument is for a nurse making his or her rounds
in a hospital to test the blood of several patients and store the test data and patient
information in the memory of the instrument. Upon the completion of the nurse's
rounds, the reflectance instrument is coupled to a work station or other data processing
instrument through a hard wire connection such as a cable. The collected test data and
patient information are communicated to the work station and processed. Processing can
include comparing accumulated data to earlier test data to determine a trend or a long
term fluctuation in the glucose levels in the patient's blood. This information can be
used to assist the doctors in diagnosis and treatment, and also to assist patients in the
control of their disease.Reflectance instruments typically have size limitations. It is preferred that the
instruments be of a size to allow them to be carried easily by a patient. This encourages
patients to carry the instrument on his or her person and to test the glucose level of their
blood several different times during each day. The test data are
