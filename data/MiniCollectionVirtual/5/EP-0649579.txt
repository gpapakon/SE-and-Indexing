The upper drive is accommodated in an insulated well and the diode emulator includes as its main current carrying element, an LDMOS transistor formed along the periphery of the well. The LDMOS transistor is driven into a conducting state at the same time the lower power transistor is driven into a conducting state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to high voltage half-bridge circuits where
one end of a load is driven from an output terminal at a junction between lower and
upper alternately conducting power transistors that are connected in series across a high
voltage DC supply. In its particular aspects, the present invention relates to circuitry for
charging a bootstrap capacitor which provides to an upper drive circuit that controls the
state of the upper transistor, a bootstrap power supply voltage floating on the voltage at
the output terminal.Applications of high voltage half-bridge circuits include electronic ballasts
for gas discharge lamps, switched mode power supplies, motor drives, and DC to AC
converters.A half-bridge driver circuit of the type mentioned, most of which is
accommodated in a high voltage integrated circuit (HVIC), is known from U.S. Patent
No. 4,989,127, granted January 29, 1991.
It discloses the
general architecture of the driver circuit as including lower and upper drives for
controlling the lower and upper power transistors, respectively. The upper drive
comprises CMOS circuitry located in a floating well within the HVIC. Adequate
breakdown voltage between this floating CMOS circuitry and the balance of the HVIC
is achieved because the design of the well periphery is equivalent to that used to form
Lateral Diffused Metal Oxide Semiconductor (LDMOS) transistors. The upper drive is
powered by a bootstrap capacitor.European Patent Application 0 318 110, which corresponds to U.S. Patent
No. 4,908,551, discloses a half-bridge circuit, where, as is now conventional, a
bootstrap capacitor powering the upper drive is charged via a diode from a low voltage
power supply voltage. The latter low voltage is formed across an off-chip high voltage
diode. In present high voltage integrated circuit half-bridge driver circuits of the
type considered herein, both the bootstrap capacitor and the diode via which the
bootstrap capacitor is charged are discrete components provided off-chip. This is
because the presently needed capacitance value of the bootstrap capacitor, in excess of
50 nf, is too large to be feasibly produced on chip, and the breakdown voltage and peak
current capacity needed in the bootstrap capacitor charging diode have also heretofore
been thought to be beyond what may feasibly be accommodated with reasonable cost of
space in the HVIC.These discrete components are costly and not as reliable as they would be
if incorporated in the HVIC.Circuitry according to the preamble portion of
claim 1
