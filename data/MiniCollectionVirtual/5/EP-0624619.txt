<ABSTRACT>
Rigid polyurethanes are obtainable by reacting     1. Polyisocyanates with   2. a polyol mixture comprising   a) - OH-functional polyesters having a molecular weight of from 260 to 2000 based on C9-C22-fatty acids, b) - non-functional oligomeric polyolefins having a molecular weight of from 700 to 6000, and optionally c) - at least difunctional polyols having a molecular weight of from 62 to 8000, preferably from 62 to 400, which are different from component 2a),  optionally in the presence of   3. water as blowing agent and 4. auxiliaries and additives known per se in PUR chemistry.
