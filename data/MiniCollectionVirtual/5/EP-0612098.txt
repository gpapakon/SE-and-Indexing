<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a single-base high-pressure discharge lamp whose discharge vessel (4) is completely surrounded by a heat concentration tube (10) and which is arranged inside an outer bulb (1). The ends (11) of the heat concentration tube (10) are pinched closed over the lamp current supply leads (7) projecting out of the discharge vessel (4). The heat concentration tube (10) is mounted in this way. Flat parts (7a) of the current supply leads (7) in the region of the pinched ends (11) serve as an anti-rotation element.

<CLAIMS>
High-pressure discharge lamp with a base at one 
end comprising 


a discharge vessel (4) sealed at both ends and 
having electrodes (5) disposed therein, said 

electrodes being connected in each case in an 
electrically conducting manner to a lamp current 

supply lead (7, 7') which is brought out of the 
discharge vessel (4), 
an ionizable filling enclosed in a gastight 
manner in the discharge vessel (4), 
an outer bulb (1) in which the discharge vessel 
(4) is mounted with the aid of a frame (8a, 8b), 
a tubular glass envelope body (10) which is 
disposed coaxially with the discharge vessel (4) 

inside the outer bulb (1) and surrounds the 
discharge vessel (4) over its entire length, 
 
characterized in that the ends of the envelope body (10) 

are provided with pinches (11, 11') by means of which the 
envelope body (10) is fixed in position on the lamp 

current supply leads (7, 7'). 
High-pressure discharge lamp with a base at one 
end according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 

pinches (11) extend over the entire diameter of the 
envelope-body ends and seal the latter. 
High-pressure discharge lamp with a base at one 
end according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 

envelope-body ends have unpinched regions (14) via which 
the interiors of envelope body (10) and outer bulb (1) 

are in communication with one another. 
High-pressure discharge lamp with a base at one  
 

end according to Claim 1, characterized in that at least 
one of the lamp current supply leads (7) has a flat 

portion (7a) in the region of the pinch (11, 11'). 
High-pressure discharge lamp with a base at one 
end according to Claim 1, characterized in that at least 

one of the lamp current supply leads (7') has, in the 
region of the pinch (11), a bend (7a') situated in the 

plane of the pinch. 
High-pressure discharge lamp with a base at one 
end according to Claim 5, characterized in that both lamp 

current supply leads (7') have, in the region of the 
pinches (11), a V-shaped section (7a') situated in the 

plane of the pinch. 
High-pressure discharge lamp with a base at one 
end according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 

the envelope body (10) has an evacuation tubule (12) 
which is embedded in one of the pinches (11).
