<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The object was to modify aliphatic polycarbonates by incorporation of further polymer units in such a way that they have novel applicationally useful service properties. 2.2 According to the invention, the copolymer contains carboxylate units in addition to alkylene carbonate groups and corresponds in chemical structure to the formula  [(CHR1 - CHR2 - O - CO - O)a(CHR3 - CH2 - CO - O)b]x where R1, R2 and R3 can be hydrogen or straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals having 1-4 carbon atoms, (a + b) = 2 to 100, and x = 10 to 10,000. The polymers can be prepared by anionic solution polymerisation from epoxides, carbon dioxide and lactones. 2.3 The polymers are amorphous, glass-clear and soluble in chlorinated hydrocarbons, aliphatic esters, ketones and aromatics. They are resistant to alcohols, water, acids, glycols, fats and oils. They can be converted by thermoplastic methods to semifinished products and mouldings which have low permeability to gases an
d are biodegradable and compostable.
