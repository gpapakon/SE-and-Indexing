<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic latch for a disk file actuator comprises a latch plate formed of a magnetic material of low magnetic hardness located on the actuator; a core 
ferromagnetic material of medium magnetic hardness mounted relative to the 

base and surrounded by a coil. A power supply is selectively coupled to the 
coil for applying magnetizing/demagnetizing energy to the core. As the latch 

plate moves in a direction toward the core and a magnetizing force is applied by 
the power supply, the latch plate becomes drawn to and restrained by the core. 

When a demagnetizing force is applied to the coil by the power supply, the 
actuator is released from the latched position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to latching mechanisms within a disk drive.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a dual state magnetic latch for
latching a disk file actuator so that the data transducer heads are parked and
maintained at a predetermined landing zone.In accordance with Winchester fixed disk drive technology, data
transducer head sliders "fly" upon an air bearing effect in very close proximity,
e.g. 7 micro inches or less, to a disk data storage surface. The air bearing exists
only when the storage disk is rotating. When the disk stops rotating, in a
"contact-start-stop" disk drive, the head sliders "land" on the disk surface.
Storage media is frequently provided with an overcoat or a lubricating coat in
order to withstand direct contact between the head slider and the storage
surface. Consequently, some disk drive manufacturers permit the slider to land
at any location of the data storage disk.Direct contact between the disk and the heads may abrade or interfere
with the storage media. Data recorded at the location of direct contact may be
changed, or a permanent defect known as a "hard error" may develop.
Accordingly, many disk drive manufacturers provide a dedicated landing zone
for the head sliders. This landing zone is usually selected to be the innermost
usable radius of the data storage disk, as magnetic storage cells or domains are
fewest at the radially inwardmost area of the disk.Head sliders are typically formed of highly lapped ferroceramic material.
The edges of the rails are very sharp. Radial displacement of the head sliders
while in contact with the data storage surface has proven very detrimental to the
integrity of the storage surface. Such movements may gouge, scratch or scrape
away the magnetic data storage coating. Thus, a latch is frequently provided to
lock the head positioner assembly (herein "actuator") at the landing zone when
power is removed from the disk drive and/or the spindle motor is not spinning
(as may occur during a reduced power standby state).Actuator latches have taken many forms. One approach pioneered by 
the assignee of the present invention has been to provide an aerodynamically
released actuator latch which releases the actuator in response to airflow
generated by disk rotation by overcoming a reverse bias force; see, e.g.
commonly assigned U.S. Patent Numbers 4,538,193; 4,692,829 and 4,647,997.
One drawback of the approaches described in these patents is that with small
disk diameters, such as 3.5" and below, airflow from a single

disk drive rotating relative to a base (12), the actuator

(18) being mounted to move relative to the base (12), which
dual state-magnetic latch is characterised in that: the

latch comprises first and second cooperating parts; the
first part forms a latch plate (40) of a ferromagnetic

material and the second part forms a magnetic latch
assembly (42); one of the first and second parts is

referenced to the actuator (18) and the another of the
first and second parts is referenced to the base (12); the

second part includes a core (44) comprising a ferromagnetic
material of medium magnetic hardness such that it may be

controllably transitioned between a magnetized state and a
demagnetized state and a coil (46) of wire surrounding the

core; a power supply (54) is coupled to the coil (46) for

alter the magnetic state of the core (44) between a
