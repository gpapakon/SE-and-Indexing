<ABSTRACT>
In the manufacture of CMOS devices, the n+ gate is 
partially counterdoped with boron to produce a modified p-type 

FET that has improved short channel effects, reduced 
gate induced drain leakage and gate oxide fields for 

improved reliability. A doped polysilicon layer is formed 
over a silicon or silicon oxide substrate, and is counterdoped 

with boron to a level of about 1 x 10

 to 5 x

 to adjust the work function but without changing the 
essentially n-type character of the gate electrode. This 

single counterdoping step achieves improved results for 
sub-micron devices at low cost. 
For CMOS device manufacturing, the alternating n-type 
and p-type devices are made in similar manner but reversing 

the n-type and p-type dopants.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for making improved complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) field effect transistors
(FET). More particularly, this invention relates to a
method for making improved low power, low threshold voltage MOSFETs and a
method of making them.Alternating p-type and n-type MOSFETs are used to
make complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices
for memory and logic applications such as DRAMS and
microprocessors. P-type MOS devices require boron channel
implants which transform the PFET to a buried channel
device. Such devices are more prone to short channel
effects, such as a lowering of the threshold voltage, than
surface channel devices, as is known. As semiconductor
devices become smaller, and as the industry moves to very
large scale integrated circuits (VLSI), which use 1 micron
design rules, and even ultra large scale integrated
circuits (ULSI) that use 0.5 micron design rules, these
short channel effects become more marked because the
channel implant dosage must be increased. Further, n+ gate
p-type FETs have gate-induced drain leakage problems due to
larger workfunction differences, which will increase as
channel lengths become shorter and gate oxide thickness is
reduced. At some point this limits the use of p-type buried
channel FETs for CMOS processing.Various investigators have tried to reduce these
problems. Very shallow channel ion implants and shallow
source/drain junctions have been tried to improve the short
channel characteristics, but the increased technical
difficulties of performing these shallow ion implants and
the low post-ion implant processing temperatures imposed on 
such devices have added to the costs of making them. In any
case as a practical matter this approach cannot be used for
gate lengths below about 0.5 micron.Thus, other workers have addressed the problem of
trying to increase threshold voltage. Lowering the
compensating channel implant dose is one way to increase
the threshold voltage, but this approach is limited to a
maximum threshold voltage of 1 volt for a supply voltage
VDD=5V, and it cannot be used at all for 0.5 micron CMOS
technologies that will use reduced voltages VDD=3V. Further,
none of the above proposals reduce gate induced drain
leakage or reduce the gate oxide fields, which are related
to the gate work function difference.The use of a surface channel p-type FET has also been
proposed to overcome the limitations of buried channel p-type
FETs, using a boron-doped p-type gate instead of an n-type
gate. CMOS
