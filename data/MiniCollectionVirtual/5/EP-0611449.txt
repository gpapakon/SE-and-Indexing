<ABSTRACT>
Methods of performing an assay for biomolecules and solid supports for use in such assays are disclosed. An activated polymeric material is used as a solid support for binding biomolecules. In a preferred form, the support is made of a generally hydrophobic, nonporous polymer which has been activated by treatment with solvents or by mechanical means to enhance the binding characteristics of the support. The support can be made of a copolymer, such as a copolymer of polystyrene and polybutadiene. Detection of bound biomolecules is preferably performed by means of staining reactions and gray level scanning. Emulsifying agents, such as detergents, can be applied to the surface of the support to substantially inhibit additional materials from being bound to the support.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ASSAY METHODS FOR BIOMOLECULES AND SOLID SUPPORT THEREOF.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to methods of performing assays for biomolecules using polymeric supports, and is particularly directed to assay methods using polymeric supports which have enhanced binding characteristics.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONImmunoassay is a class of scientific techniques used to detect small amounts of biomolecules in biological samples. These techniques are widely used in medical diagnostic procedures, such as blood tests and the like, to detect specific proteins ("antigens"). Conventional methods of immunoassay rely on the selective reaction of a particular protein with an antigen. For example, it is well known that animals develop a specific antibody to combat a particular foreign antigen. Because the antibody has a highly specific chemical configuration, it reacts selectively with the antigen and not with other proteins. The reaction of the antibody with the antigen ("precipitation") binds the antigen so that it can be further processed and, ultimately, destroyed or removed from the system. Such antibody-antigen reactions give rise to the well-known immune response in animals, by which animals are able to resist infections to which they have been previously exposed.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 This ability of antibodies to selectively bind to antigens can also be used to detect antigens present in a biological sample. For example, when a patient has a particular illness, one or more characteristic antigens will be present in the blood. An antibody to that antigen will selectively bind to the antigen. A common type of immunoassay which relies on this effect is the "antibody capture assay." To detect an antigen in particular sample, the antigen is first immobilized by attaching it to a solid support. A support often used for this purpose is a "microtiter plate", which is a plastic plate made of clear polystyrene or polyvinylchloride. The plate is molded with 96 depressions or wells in which biological samples are held for testing. When a sample is added to a well in the plate, antigens in the sample are bound or attached to the support r and are thereby immobilized. This binding is not a chemical reaction but, rather, is believed to result from a physical or noncovalent interaction between the polystyrene matrix and the antigen. Once the antigen is bound to the support, an antibody known to be specific to that antigen is allowed to react with, and bind to, the immobilized antigen. It is then possible to
