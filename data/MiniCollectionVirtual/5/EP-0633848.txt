<ABSTRACT>
The mechanism comprises a pivotable hand-operated actuating lever (101) which engages a drive plate (102) biased upright by a spring (122). The drive plate (102) moves an output rod (103) connected to a brake cable. The output rod (103) is held by a lock plate (104) which is released by a push rod (110) passing through the lever (101). THe linkage (115, 117) between the lever (101) and the drive plate (102) prevents the lever from returning to its lowered position when the brake has been applied. A spring (162) returns the lever (101) to its lowered position when the brake is released. The mechanism automatically adjusts for variation in the brake cable tension by the action of the spring (122) on an abutment plate (130) fixed to the end of the output rod (103). Additional self adjustment mechanisms are described (figures 4 to 7). Further hand or foot operated brake actuating mechanisms are also described (figures 1 to 3 and figure 10), together with additional hydraulic or manually operated mechanisms for release of the lock plate (104). A mechanism is described which signals that the brake has been applied (figure 11). A "soft-release" mechanism (figure 12) and a release damper (figure 14) are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to actuating 
mechanisms for parking brakes of vehicles. A known type of hand-operated vehicle parking 
brake uses a lever to tighten a brake cable, which is 
held taut by a locking pawl engaged with a ratchet. A 
typical lever ratio is 7 to 1 so a long lever is 
necessary. During the lifetime of the vehicle 
adjustment of the hand brake is necessary, in order to 
take up sag in the cable. Hand brakes are noisy as the 
ratchet and pawl mechanism clicks as the brake is 
applied. Similar problems arise with foot-operated 
parking brakes. US-A-2871713 describes a transmission brake 
mechanism in which a hand-operated lever operates a 
pair of wobble plates which act upon a brake-operating 
rod. The action of the wobble plates on the rod allow 
it to be moved progressively with successive strokes of 
the lever in one direction. The brake is released by 
movement of the lever in the opposite direction beyond 
its normal rest position. The mechanism is such that 
the rod is never simultaneously free from engagement 
with both plates. The present applicants' patent application 
WO92/08628 (PCT/GB91/02022, claiming priority from GB 
9025041.6) describes a handbrake which replaces the 
ratchet and pawl mechanism with a tiltable frictional 
drive plate. The handbrake used a collapsing lever 
which returned a drive plate to a rest position when 
the handbrake was applied, which has the advantage 
that, as the lever is not integral with the mechanism, 
one can construct this lever from a flammable or 
meltable material such as certain plastics, without the 
risk that the brake could be released during a vehicle 
fire.  
 However the feature of a collapsible lever 
may prove unacceptable to the car industry and 
therefore it is an object of this invention to overcome 
the above mentioned disadvantage whilst retaining the 
other advantages of a handbrake which do not use a pawl 
and ratchet mechanism. The invention provides an actuating mechanism 
for a vehicle parking brake, comprising an actuating 
member which is movable relative to a mechanism 
mounting means between a first, brake-off and a second, 
brake-on position, an output member which moves in a 
brake-applying direction when the actuating member 
moves from its first to its second position, a tiltable 
drive element having an aperture through which the 
output member extends and which is tiltable from a 
released position to a position in which it engages the 
output member frictionally in its aperture, a 
releasable means for
