<ABSTRACT>
Granule proteases having DNA fragmenting activity and useful in targeting tumor cells to cause nuclear collapse and apoptosis in the tumor cells have been isolated and purified. In particular, these proteases, termed fragmentin 1, fragmentin 2 and fragmentin 3, have non-reduced apparent molecular weights of 47 kD, 31 kD and 27 kD respectively, have been isolated from a rat natural killer tumor cell line by solubilization of rat RNK cell granules and purification of the granular proteases.

3 NOVEL PROTEASES WITH DNA FRAGMENTING ACTIVITYFIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to certain proteases isolated and purified from granule protein produced by rat natural killer cells which have DNA fragmenting activity.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION The molecular .--mediators of lymphocyte-induced cytolysis are thougfrfcrto reside within the cytcÏ…lasmic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells (refs. 1 to 4 - the references are identified at the end of the disclosure. Reference 1 was published after the priority date of this application) . The delivery of these molecules to the plasma membrane of the target cells occurs by exocytosis (ref. 5) and has been detected by the release of granule constituents into the intercellular space between the killer cell and target (refs. 6 , 1 ) . The destruction of the target cells appears to be of two distinct forms, the dissolution of the plasma membrane and apoptosis including the characteristic cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments (for review see ref. 8) . One of the constituents of the cytoplasmic granules is the pore- forming protein called either perforin in the T cell (ref. 3) or cytolysin in the NK cell (ref. 2) which is capable of disrupting the target cell membrane but is unable to produce the DNA damage identified following CTL and NK cell-mediated killing (refs. 1, 8, 9). In addition to perforin/cytolysin, a subfamily of serine proteases has been identified in lymphocytes (ref. 10, 11) which is stored in cytoplasmic granules (ref. 12, 13) . Exocytosis of granules results in the release of serine proteases into the extracellular environment (ref. 14) . The lymphocyte serine proteases, sometimes called 'granzymes', have been identified in human (refs. 15, 16, 

 17), murine (refs. 10, 18, 19) and rat (ref. 20) homologues, with as many as seven distinct genes now identified in mice and three in humans. The specificity of only two gene products has been determined. Granzyme A/Hanukah. Factor (HF)1 was originally discovered by its ability to cleave the 'BLT' substrate (ref. 14), and was subsequently identified as a tryptase, while CCPI/granzyme B was found to be an asp-ase (refs. 21 to 23) . Other protease activities have been detected in the rat NK granules, although the proteins mediating the hydrolysis have not been identified (ref. 24) .SUMMARY OF INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, there have been isolated, purified and characterized lymphocyte serine granule proteases which have DNA-fragmenting
