nitrogen atom or -NO- and the others are carbon atoms;
 
   R¹ and R² are independently hydrogen, alkyl or arylalkyl, or, 
R¹ and R² taken together with the carbon atom to which they are attached 
form a 5- to 7-membered carbocyclic ring;
 
 
   R³ is hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, 
arylalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, -CN, -NO₂, -COR, -COOR, -CONHR, 
-CONRR', -CF₃, S-alkyl, -SOalkyl, -SO₂alkyl,

with an acetal of formula
 
III 
where R⁵ and R5' are the same alkyl groups or can together form a 
dioxolane ring, in the presence of a catalytic amount of a tertiary amine in an  
 
inert organic solvent such as toluene or xylene to form compounds of 
formula I. The present invention relates to novel processes for preparing 
compounds of formula I. Listed below are definitions of various terms 
used to describe the compounds of the instant invention. These definitions 
apply to the terms as they are used throughout the specification (unless they 
are otherwise limited in specific instances) either individually or as part of a 
larger group. The term "alkyl" refers to straight and branched chain hydrocarbons, 
containing 1 to 8 carbons in the normal chain, preferably 1 to 5 carbons 
such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, the various branched chain 
isomers thereof such as isopropyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, 4,4-dimethylpentyl, 
2,2,4-trimethylpentyl and the like as well as such groups including a 
halo-substituent, such as F, Br, Cl or I such as CCl₃ or CF₃, an alkoxy 
substituent, an aryl substituent, an alkyl-aryl substituent, a haloaryl 
substituent, a cycloalkyl substituent, an alkyl-cycloalkyl substituent, a
