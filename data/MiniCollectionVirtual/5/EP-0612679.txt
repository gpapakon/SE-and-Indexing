<ABSTRACT>
It does not have a system for extracting sheets ahead of the limit stop (10) and a stationary surface in contact with the stack close to the said limit stop (10). It comprises at least three rollers (5, 6, 7) capable of entraining the sheet with which they are in contact by means of friction, the axis of the output roller (5) being vertically in line with the limit stop (10). Furthermore it includes means for synchronising the said rollers (5, 6, 7) so that during delivery (distribution) of a given sheet (2a), on the one hand, each of the rollers (6, 7) upstream of the outlet roller (5) is decelerated after the said sheet (2a) has left contact with it and, on the other hand, the output roller (5) is decelerated after the trailing edge (2c) of the said sheet (2a) has substantially passed beyond vertically in line with the limit stop (10), the rollers (6, 7) upstream already being in the halted position.

Device for distributing semi-rigid sheets one by 
one below or above a stop, behind which said sheets are 

stacked, comprising rotary supply members, mounted in 
a suction chamber and adapted to entrain by friction 

the sheet with which they are in contact, characterized 
in that, said device having no sheet-extraction system 

in front of the stop (10) and no fixed surface in contact 
with the stack in the vicinity of said stop (10), the 

rotary supply members consist of at least three cylinders 
(5, 6, 7), the axis of the outlet cylinder (5) being 

vertical with respect to the stop (10), and in that it 
comprises means for synchronizing said cylinders (5, 

6, 7) so that, during distribution of a given sheet (2
a
), 
on the one hand, each of the cylinders (6, 7) upstream 

of the outlet cylinder (5) is decelerated after said 
sheet (2
a
) has left contact therewith and therefore after 
the following sheet has come into contact therewith and, 

on the other hand, the outlet cylinder (5) is decelerated 
after the rear edge (2
c
) of said sheet (2
a
) has passed 
to a position vertical with respect to the stop (10), 

and therefore after the following sheet has come into 
contact therewith, the cylinders (6, 7) upstream already 

being in stopped position. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the synchronization means are adjusted so as to decelerate 

the outlet cylinder (5) after the rear edge (2
c
) of the 
sheet (2
a
) has passed beyond the vertical (17) with respect 
to the stop (10) by a distance of the order of 10 mm. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the synchronization means are adjusted so as 

to decelerate each cylinder (7, 6) upstream of the outlet 
cylinder (5) after the rear edge (2
c
) of the sheet (2
a
) 
left contact with said cylinder (7, 6) by a distance 

of the order of 10 mm.  
 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the synchronization means comprise an independent, 

electronically servo-controlled motor for each 
supply cylinder (5, 6, 7) and an electronic circuit for 

controlling said motors. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the synchronization means comprise a motor 

for driving the outlet cylinder (5), gears provided with 
clutch-brakes mounted on the shafts of the other cylinders 

and an electronic circuit for controlling the clutch-brakes 
and the motor. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the front stop (10) is a continuous plate. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that it comprises rotary bearing members (8, 

9), free to rotate, disposed so that they support the 
rear part of the stack (4), whilst the supply cylinders 

(5, 6, 7) support the front part thereof. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
it comprises two shafts (14, 15) supporting the rotary 

bearing members (8, 9) and a rear blocking stop (11), 
the ends of the shafts (14, 15) and said stop (11) being 

adapted to be displaced on longitudinal arms as a function 
of the length of the stacked sheets (2), so that the 

stroke of displacement of the shaft (14) closest to the 
supply cylinders is approximately 2/3 that of the other 

shaft (15) and of the stop (11). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that it comprises means for adaptation to the 

width of the stack, comprising: 

a) two lateral plates (12, 13) for blocking the stack 
(4), provided with transverse displacement means (25), 

and 
b) two extensible or sliding covering members (28) in 
the form of gussets or plates and which tightly cover,  

 
for each of them, the zone extending, on the one hand, 

between the lateral plate (12) and the outer upright 
(26) and, on the other hand, between the stop (10) and 

the rear upright (21) of the suction chamber (19).
