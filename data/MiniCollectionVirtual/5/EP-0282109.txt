<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a liquid crystalline 
colour display cell comprising two parallel,spatially 
separated transparent substrate plates which are 
provided with electrodes on their facing surfaces, and 
which are interconnected along the periphery by means of 
a seal, these substrate plates enclosing a space which is 
filled with a liquid crystalline cell medium having a 
180-360° twist across the cell thickness. Herein "twist" is to be understood to mean a ro­
tation of the director of the longitudinal axes of the 
molecules of the liquid crystalline compound across the cell 
thickness, i.e. from one substrate plate to the other. In recent years the attention for a display cell 
having a 180-360° twist has grown steadily. This applies 
more particularly to a display cell having a 180-270° twist 
and more notably to one having a 270° twist. During operation 
the cell is exposed to linearly polarised white light which 
is incident via the transparent substrate plate. During 
its passage through the cell the linearly polarised light is 
changed into elliptically polarised light due to birefringen­
ce of the cell medium and the twist configuration. The cell 
having a 180-360° twist is known as STN cell, i.e. super­
twist nematic cell. The special STN cell having a 270° 
twisted configuration is known as supertwist birefringence 
effect cell (SBE). The advantage of this type of cell relative to, 
in pargicular, the well-known twisted nematic cell (TN 
cell) having a 90° twist is the steep transmission-voltage 
characteristic. This means that when a voltage is applied 
across the cell, a large difference in transmission of the 
light through the cell occurs in a very small voltage range 
around a threshold value. Thus, it becomes possible to con­
trol a large number of lines by means of time multiplexing,  
 
yielding a high information density. The STN or SBE cell also has disadvantages. The 
first disadvantage being that two polarisers are required. The 
cell is operated only with linearly polarised light. When 
no voltage or a voltage below the threshold voltage is 
applied across the electrodes of the cell, the director 
exhibits the above-mentioned 180-360° twist and preferably 
a 270° twist. The cell is exposed to linearly polarised 
light via the polariser, which light passes through the 
cell via the transparent substrate plate and the trans­
parent electrode in a direction perpendicular to the 
substrate plates. Due to birefringence the linearly polarised 
light is changed into elliptically

substrate plates which are provided with electrodes on 
their facing surfaces, and which are interconnected along 

the periphery by means of a seal, these substrate plates 
enclosing a space which is filled with a liquid crystalline 

cell medium having a 180-360° twist (rotation of the direc­
tor) across the cell thickness, characterized in that one 

of the two transparent substrate plates is provided with 
phosphors which emit coloured light under the influence 

of ultraviolet light, in that the cell medium contains 
a dichroic, ultraviolet light-absorbing substance, and 

in that the cell contains maximally one polariser. 
2. A liquid crystalline colour display cell as 
claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the cell medium 

contains a dichroic substance which absorbs ultraviolet 
light having a wavelength of approximately 360-370 nm. 
3. A liquid crystalline colour display cell as 
claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the cell 

medium contains a liquid crystalline compound and a di­
chroic, UV light-absorbing substance. 
4. A liquid crystalline colour display cell as claimed 
in Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the cell medium con­
tains a liquid crystalline substance which itself is di­

chroic and UV light-absorbing. 
5. A liquid crystalline colour display cell as 
claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the phosphors 

are provided on the inner wall of the substrate plate facing 
the cell medium. 
6. A liquid crystalline colour display cell as claimed 
in Claim 1, characterized in that the substrate plate 

which is provided with phosphors contains an interference 
filter which is provided between the electrodes and the 

 
phosphors, and which passes UV light and reflects the 

excitation light produced by the phosphors. 
7. A method of displaying a coloured picture, em­
ploying a colour display cell as described in any one of 

the preceding Claims, in which a voltage pattern in ac­
cordance with the picture to be displayed is applied to the 

electrodes located on either side of the cell medium, the 
cell being exposed to UV light via the transparent sub­

strate plate, in which the UV light is absorbed in those 
parts of the cell medium which are located between non-­

excited electrodes, nand the UV light is passed in those 
parts of the cell medium where the electrodes located on 

either side of the cell medium are excited, or conversely, 
in which the transmitted UV light excites the phosphor dots 

provided on the other substrate plate, which then emit 
a coloured light beam.
