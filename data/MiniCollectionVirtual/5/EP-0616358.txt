<ABSTRACT>
A double-enveloped lamp assembly (10) includes a 
light-source capsule (16), which is substantially 

surrounded by a light-transmissive shroud (14) made of 
glass, preferably aluminosilicate glass. In a 

preferred embodiment, the lamp assembly (10) is a metal 
halide arc discharge lamp, and the shroud (14) is a 

cylindrical, open-ended tube. For metal halide lamps 
having a power rating of 150 watts or less, the shroud (14) 

preferably has a wall thickness of one millimeter. 
The thin wall glass shroud meets or exceeds 

containment performance requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of a
light transmissive
glass shroud in accordance with the generic clause of claim 1.Double-enveloped lamps, such as metal halide arc
lamps, include a light-source capsule, such as an arc
tube, and a sealed outer envelope surrounding the
light-source capsule. The arc tube typically operates
at high temperature and high pressure. In such lamps,
there is a small probability that the light-source
capsule will burst. When this occurs, hot fragments
of fused quartz from the arc tube are forceably
propelled against the outer envelope. If the outer
envelope also shatters, there is a potential safety
hazard to persons or property in the immediate
surroundings. A failure of the outer envelope is
known as a containment failure.From document GB-A-20 56760 there is
already known the use of a borosilicate glass
shroud placed within a sealed light-transmissive
outer envelope of a metal halide arc lamp
assembly and substantially surrounding a metal halide
arc tube for the prevention of the breakage of said outer envelope
in the event of an arc tube explosion, wherein said metal halide arc tube
is mounted within said outer envelope and wherein said halide are lamp
assembly further comprises means for supplying electrical energy to said arc tube.European Patent Application No. 416 705 A1 discloses a high-pressure
discharge lamp having
an inner sheath of quartz
glass around the lamp vessel and an outer sheath of
aluminosilicate glass around the inner sheath.Document EP-A-19850 describes the conventional structure of a
halogen incandescent lamp, comprising a bulb which is
constructed of aluminosilicate glass, having a strain point of
660째C or higher, so that the bulb will hardly suffer any
undesirable cracks even if it is heated to a temperature
provided for the performance of halogen cycle, i.e. 250째C or
higher.European Patent Application No. 181 690 A1 relates to the
production of transparent, high silica glass envelopes for
tungsten halogen lamps, whereby said glass exhibit annealing
points between about 900 to 925째C, while thermal stability and
low water content, i.e., a beta OH value of less than 0.4mm-1, is
retained. United States Patent No. 5,122,706, issued June
16, 1992 to Parrott et al., discloses a metal halide
arc lamp wherein a generally cylindrical fused quartz 
shroud encircles an arc tube. Typically, the shroud
is made of fused quartz and is at least about 2.0 mm
(0.098 inches) thick. The shroud may be open at both
ends, or may be open at one end and have a domed
configurat

<CLAIMS>
Use of a light-transmissive glass shroud (14) placed within
a sealed light-transmissive outer envelope (12) of a metal halide arc lamp assembly

and substantially surrounding a metal halide arc tube (16)
for the prevention of the breakage of said

outer envelope (12) in the event of an arc tube
explosion, wherein said metal halide arc tube (16) is

mounted within said outer envelope (12) and wherein said
halide arc lamp assembly further comprises means

(24,28,32,34) for supplying electrical energy to said arc
tube (16),
characterised by

said light-transmissive glass shroud being of an
aluminosilicate glass.
Use of a light-transmissive glass shroud according to claim
1, wherein said glass shroud (14) has a strain point

temperature greater than the operating temperature of said
glass shroud (14) in said lamp assembly (10).
Use of a light-transmissive glass shroud according to claim
2, wherein said glass shroud (14) has a low water content so

that beta, which is a measure of the infrared absorption of
light in the material due to structural bonded water, is

less than about 0.4 mm
-1
.
Use of a light-transmissive glass shroud according to claim
1, wherein said arc tube (16) has a power rating of 150

watts or less, and said glass shroud has a wall thickness of
about 1 mm. 
Use of a light-transmissive glass shroud according to claim
4, wherein said glass shroud (14) comprises an open-ended,

cylindrical tube.
Use of a light-transmissive glass shroud according to claim
1, wherein said glass shroud (14) is selected to have a

strain point temperature of about 600째C or greater.
