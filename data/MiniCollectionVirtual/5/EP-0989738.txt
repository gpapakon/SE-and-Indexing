<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a document analysis method to
detect BW/color areas comprising the following steps:


step 1) getting an input image data to be split in
elementary information;
step 2) analysing the input data to get the colorfulness
of each elementary information;
step 3) creating a first and a second output layers
corresponding to the BW and color elementary information

respectively;
step 4) applying a first set of atomic operations to the
BW layer and a second different set of atomic operations to

the color layer;
step 5) combining the BW and color layers in order to
obtain a desired format for the output data.
The invention also relates to a scanning device (17) to
acquire documents comprising an input (IN) that receives an

input image data, and is connected to a layer creator
component (18), which in turn outputs a first and a second

layer, such layers having different data compression rate.
Finally, the invention relates to a method for acquiring a
document based on the analysis of the content of the

document itself, comprising the following steps:

getting an input image data;
creating a first layer containing the image
information in a color format;
creating a second layer containing the image
information in a BW format; 
managing the first and the second layers in order to
obtain a desired format for an output document.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a document analysis method
and, more particularly, to a document analysis method to
detect BW/color areas.Moreover, the invention relates to a scanning device to
acquire documents.Finally, the invention relates to a method for acquiring a
document based on the analysis of the content of the
document itself.As is well known in the technical field of image
processing, during its life an image is processed by a
plurality of electronic devices, that create, acquire,
display store, read and write the image itself.The image data processing device, and the corresponding
processing method deal with an image acquired by means of
an image acquisition device, for example a scanner.The image data so obtained are usually organized into a
raster of pixels, each pixels providing an elementary image
information.In other words, images are, at the most basic level, arrays
of digital values, where a value is a collection of numbers
describing the attributes of a pixel in the image. For
example, in bitmaps, the above mentioned values are single
binary digits.Often, these numbers are fixed-point representation of a
range of real number; for example, the integers 0 through 
255 are often used to represent the numbers from 0.0 to
1.0. Often too, these numbers represent the intensity at a
point of the image (gray scale) or the intensity of one
color component at that point.An important distinction has to be made in the images to be
processed between achromatic and colored images.In fact, achromatic light has only one attribute, which is
the quantity of light. This attribute can be discussed in
the physic sense of energy, in which case the terms
intensity and luminance are used, or in the psychological
sense of perceived intensity, in which case the term
brightness is used.It is useful to associate a scale with different intensity
levels, for instance defining 0 as black and 1 as white;
intensity levels between 0 and 1 represent different levels
of grays.The visual sensations caused by colored light are much more
richer than those caused by achromatic light. Discussion on
color perception usually involves three quantities, known
as hue, saturation and lightness.
1. Hue distinguishes among colors such as red, green,
purple and yellow.2. Saturation refers to how far a color is from a gray of
equal intensity. Red is highly saturated; pink is
relatively unsaturated; royal blue is highly saturated; sky
blue is relatively unsaturated. Pastel colors are
relatively unsaturated; unsaturated colors
