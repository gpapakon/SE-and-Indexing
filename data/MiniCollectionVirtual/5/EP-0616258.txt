<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to positive-working, radiation-sensitive mixtures essentially comprising   (a1) an organic binder containing acid-labile groups which is insoluble in water, but becomes soluble in aqueous alkaline solutions on treatment with acid, or   (a2.1) a polymeric binder which is insoluble in water, but soluble in aqueous alkaline solutions and (a2.2) an organic compound whose solubility in an aqueous alkaline developer is increased by treatment with acid,  and (b) an organic compound which produces an acid on exposure to actinic radiation and which additionally contain (c) a strongly basic, organic compound containing hydroxyl, alkoxy or phenoxy anions.   These mixtures are suitable for the production of relief structures of improved contrast.
