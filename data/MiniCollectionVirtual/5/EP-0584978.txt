organopolysiloxanes blocked by a hydrolyzable silyl group 

at a terminal end of molecular chain thereof, (B) an epoxy 
compound, (C) a carbonyl group-containing organic compound, 

(D) an amino group-containing organic compound, and

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a room temperature
curable polymeric composition which is useful as constructional
sealing material, coating material, encapsulating
or potting material for electric and electronic
components, fiber-treating agent, adhesive for automotive,
constructional and electric or electronic uses, and so
forth.As a condensation-curing type room temperature
curable composition comprising an alkylene oxide polymer
or an organopolysiloxane as base polymer, there have been
known those of one-pack type in which the amount of
crosslinking agent is reduced to an utmost degree and
crosslinking rate is enhanced by hydrolysis of
hydrolyzable groups introduced into the base component and
those of two-pack type in which a crosslinking agent and a
curing agent are enclosed in separate packs.However, the one-pack type compositions need a
considerable length of time for curing to their deep portions,
though they have a high rate of cure from the surface
thereof. The two-pack type compositions are comparatively
better in deep portion curing properties, but they
are disadvantageous in that, because their two parts in 
separate packs are not formulated for a mixing ratio of
1:1 by volume or by weight, they are poorly processable in
quantity measurement or mixing operations and are not well
suited to use with mixing machines or the like. In the
two-pack type compositions, furthermore, suitable ranges
for addition amounts of crosslinking agent and curing
agent necessary for complete cure to deep portions of the
composition are very narrow and, accordingly, it is necessary
to specify strictly the addition amounts of the
crosslinking agent and curing agent or to add water as a
deep portion curing agent.Recently, curable compositions comprising as main
constituents thereof a so-called crosslinkable silyl
group-containing alkylene oxide polymer, i.e. an alkylene
oxide polymer containing a hydrolyzable silyl group whose
hydrolysis is accompanied by crosslinking, and an epoxy
resin have been developed (See Japanese Pre-examination
Patent Publication (KOKAI) Nos. 61-268720 (1986), 62-283120
(1987), 2-145674 (1990), 2-145675 (1990) and 2-228365
(1990)). In this type of compositions, crosslinking
and curing of the crosslinkable silyl group-containing
alkylene oxide polymer proceeds separately from that of
the epoxy resin. Namely, the crosslinkable silyl group-containing
alkylene oxide polymer is cured by crosslinking
which results from formation of siloxane linkages under
the action of moisture, whereas the
