<ABSTRACT>
An information providing device (2) connected to telephone 
lines, on receiving a call from a user's terminal (1), 

sends out a guidance to the terminal, prompts the user to input 
the card number and password number. After the input of the 

numbers by the user, the device transfers the numbers to the 
host computer (3) which manages the information utilization 

fees. The host computer checks the user conditions including 
the identification of the user for each number. If the conditions 

are satisfied the host computer transfers the card number and 
others to a card credit company (5) to make the credit reference 

and other confirmations of the user. When receiving the result 
of the credit reference and the other confirmations from the 

card credit company, the host computer transmits it to the information 
providing device. If the result of the c
redit reference 
is normal, the information providing device begins providing 

the information service as selected by the user through the user's 
terminal. After the service the terminal transmits the utilization 

date to the host computer and the card credit company.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a service 
providing system on credit, of which a credit card holder can 
make use via a telephone circuit. More particularly, this invention relates to a service 
providing system according to which, when various information 
is provided to a credit card holder for pay via a telephone 
circuit, the credit card holder can make payment on credit, 
and a service providing system according to which a credit 
card holder can order the item she or he wishes to purchase 
via a telephone circuit, and can make payment on credit. In recent years, a certain telephone service system that 
allows the user to gain access to specific information via a 
public telephone network, e.g., Dial Q², has enjoyed an 
increased popularity, and has been expected to open a new yet 
promising business market. However, this system has become a 
grave social problem, partly because the information it can 
provide is mainly oriented to entertainment and leisure, and 
partly because it is likely to be used by unqualified people 
and abused by insolvent youth. In addition, the mechanism of 
Dial Q² service has had its own limitations, because the 
service area is limited, some public telephone sets cannot be 
applied to the system, and so on. Moreover, various problems 
have arouse in connection with the collection of service 
charges by public communications corporations. Also, much use has recently been made of a mail-order 
system which enables the user to order various items via a 
telephone circuit and to make payment on credit by delivering 
cash or transferring given formats to the mail-order firm 
after the user has obtained the item. To give an order to a  
 
mail-order firm for the desired item and, at the same time, 
to make payment by transmitting the credit card code thereto 
by way of a telephone may be achieved by manually operating 
the terminals for cross-reference. As mentioned just above, conventional information 
providing service systems have had various problems; they are 
likely to be used by unqualified persons, much more 
information than would be reasonable may possibly be provided 
because the collection of the service charges is carried out 
by public communication corporations that collect the charges 
for telephone calls. Mail-order systems making use of a telephone circuit 
have the following problems. When payment is made on credit, 
awkward exchanges of papers are needed for checking whether 
or not conditions for settlement of accounts on credit are 
satisfied

making use of a telephone circuit, comprising: 

   an information providing unit connected to said 
tele
phone circuit, which detects a signal from a user 
terminal to send out guidance, and receives card and secret 

codes from the user terminal to transfer those codes to a 
host computer that manages a service charge, 

   said host computer using information stored in a memory 
about a user for each transferred code to check up service 

conditions including the verification of the user, so that 
when the conditions are satisfied, said host computer 

transfer said card and secret codes to a card company for 
credit and other inquiries, and said host computer receiving 

the results of the credit inquiry from said card company to 
transmit them to said information providing unit, 

   said information providing unit receiving said results 
of the credit inquiry to message them to said user terminal 

and, when said results of the credit inquiry have no fault, 
starting to provide service information to said user 

terminal, and 
   after the completion of the provision of service 

information, said information providing unit transmitting 
service data to said host computer and said card company. 
The system according to Claim 1, wherein: 
   said information providing unit receives said card and 

secret codes and thereupon sends out menu guidance for 
information that can be provided to said user terminal, and
