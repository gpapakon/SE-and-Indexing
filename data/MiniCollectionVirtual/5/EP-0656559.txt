<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical compensatory
sheet which is useful for a liquid crystal display.As a display for electronic office system-devices such
as a desk-top personal computer and a word processor for
Japanese language, CRT (cathode ray tube) has been employed
so far. Recently, a liquid crystal display (hereinafter
referred to as LCD) is increasingly employed instead of the
CRT because of its thin thickness, light weight and low
power consumption. LCD generally has a structure that a
liquid crystal cell is disposed between a pair of polarizing
sheets. Most of LCD use a twisted nematic liquid crystal.
Operational mode of LCD using the twisted nematic
liquid crystal is roughly divided into birefringence mode
and optical rotatory mode.A super twisted nematic liquid crystal display (hereinafter
referred to as STN-LCD) utilizing the birefringence
mode uses a super twisted nematic liquid crystal showing a
twisted angle of more than 90 degrees and having steep
electro-optical characteristics. Such STN-LCD, therefore,
has an advantage of giving display of a large capacity by
driving in time-sharing mode. However, the STN-LCD has
disadvantages such as slow response (several hundred milliseconds) 
and difficulty in giving satisfactory gradation on
display, and therefore its display characteristics are relatively
poor, as compared with display characteristics of a
liquid crystal display using the known active-type elements
(e.g., TFT-LCD and MIM-LCD).In the TFT-LCD and MIM-LCD, twisted nematic liquid
crystal showing a twisted angle of 90 degrees is employed
for displaying an image. This is called LCD of an optically
rotary mode (i.e., TN-LCD). TN-LCD display mode
shows fast response (several tens of milliseconds) and high
display contrast, and easily gives black-white display of
high contrast. Hence, the optical rotatory mode has a
number of advantages compared with the birefringence mode
or other modes. However, TN-LCD has disadvantages that
color or contrast on display varies depending upon viewing
direction to a liquid crystal display, and its display
characteristics are not comparable to display characteristics
of CRT.In order to improve the viewing angle characteristics
(i.e. to enlarge the viewing angle), arrangement of a phase
difference film (optical compensatory sheet) between a pair
of polarizing plates and TN liquid crystal cell has been
proposed in Japanese Patent Provisional Publications No.
4(1992)-229828 and No. 4(1992)-258923.The phase difference films proposed in these
