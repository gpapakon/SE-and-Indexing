<ABSTRACT>
A dynamic testing system is described for testing automotive shock absorbers and suspension systems. The testing system includes placing a vehicle (20) on a rolling road surface provided by at least one roller or pair of parallel rollers (1) supporting the front or rear wheels of the vehicle, or several such rollers or pairs of rollers supporting both the front and rear wheels (3) of the vehicle, the roller or at least one roller in the or each pair either having an irregular or eccentric surface or else being eccentrically mounted so as to impart a vertical vibratory motion to the suspension system of the vehicle when driven on that surface, positively driving the vehicle at a predetermined speed on that rolling surface, either using the vehicle's own motive power, or, preferably, by positively driving one or more of those rollers forming that rolling road, applying a controlled braking pressure to the vehicle's braking system to provide a predetermined retardation force acting on the vehicle, and whilst that retardation force is applied measuring and comparing the rotational speed of the roller(s) with the rotational speed of the vehicle wheels.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TESTING SHOCK ABSORBERS AND SUSPENSION SYSTEMSFIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a method and apparatus for testing shock absorbers and suspension systems. In particular, the present invention relates to the in situ testing of a motor vehicle's shock absorber unit(s).BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONThe performance of a motor vehicle, such as an automobile or a motorbike, will be adversely affected, particularly as regards road holding ability and hence safety, if the shock absorbers and other components of the suspension system are worn or are otherwise defective. It is therefore important that the condition of the suspension components should be checked at regular intervals. There are indeed statutory requirements in the UK and other European countries for the condition of vehicle shock absorbers to be checked annually.Very often, this check consists of not much more than a visual check on the physical condition of the shock absorber and some arbitrary testing of the functional characteristics of the shock absorber by manual rocking of the vehicle. Alternatively, of course, the shock absorbers can be removed for rather more scientific bench testing, but this is time consuming and expensive, and, in any case, such bench testing does not, and cannot, simulate actual driving conditions encountered on the road by the vehicle, and so provides very little information on the in situ performance of the shock absorber or to be precise, the combined effect of all four shock absorbers, or more as the case may be. Such tests therefore bear little relation to the actual performance of the suspension system as a whole. 

A perfect automotive suspension system should maintain a uniform contact pressure between the wheels of the vehicle and the road surface, and an even load on the tyres at all times. In particular, there should be no tendency for the wheels to slip or lose contact with the ground when subjected to vertical acceleration, particularly when braking or cornering or accelerating.The maintenance of uniform contact pressure between the wheels and the road surface at all times is particularly important, but especially difficult to achieve, when the vehicle is travelling over a rough or pave surface where there is a significant tendency, which the shock absorbers are there to counter, for the wheel or wheels to bounce when hitting a lump or other defect in the road surface, and momentarily to lose contact altogether with the road surface, or at least undergoing a significant
