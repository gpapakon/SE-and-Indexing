<ABSTRACT>
A curved slot (54) extends from the tip (42) of a 
turbine blade adjacent the pressure side (46) and 

terminates at the pressure side (46) at a location where 
there is sufficient static pressure so that the pressure 

drop across the slot (54) induces a pumping action to 
the tip (42), to minimise leakage of flow around the 

blade tip. In another embodiment a curved slot (66) is 
judiciously located to be in communication with the film 

cooling hole discharging on the pressure side (46) of 
the blade and the tip (42) of the blade adjacent the 

pressure side of the blade.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rotor blades for gas
turbine engines and particularly to means for
passively controlling the gap between the rotor blades
and the outer air seal.As is well known in the aeronautical field, the
efficiency of the rotor blades and particularly the
turbine blades of a gas turbine engine is adversely
affected by the leakage of engine's working medium
between the tips of the rotor blades and the outer air
seal or shroud surrounding the tips. Obviously the
energy from the working medium that leaks, which would
otherwise pass through the working blades, is a loss
resulting in the degradation in performance of that
rotor stage and hence, the performance of the engine.
Over the years there has been numerous attempts to
reduce the size of the gap between the tips of the
rotor blades and the outer shroud or outer air seal 
either by active clearance control or passive
clearance control in order to achieve a higher
performance engine.Active clearance control includes an external
control mechanism (open or close loop) that
effectively reduces the gap by controlling a medium
that heats or cools the component parts of the rotor
assembly to either shrink or expand the case or the
rotor disk or blades so as to move either component
toward or away from the other. Obviously, the control
must avoid the pinch point where the parts expand at
rapid different rates to avoid rubs which may cause
damage to the engine. An example of an active
clearance control is disclosed and claimed in U. S.
Patent Number 4,069,662 granted to I. H. Redinger,
Jr. et al on January 24, 1978 entitled "Clearance
Control for Gas Turbine Engine" assigned to United
Technologies Corporation, the applicant in this
patent application.Passive clearance control, which is the subject
matter of the present invention, utilizes the
available working or cooling medium in the engine and
without any control mechanism, effectively reduces the
effective gap between the tips of the blade and the 
outer air seal. Examples of passive clearance controls
are disclosed in U. S. Patent Number 4,390,320 granted
to J. E. Eiswerth on June 28, 1983 entitled "Tip Cap
for a Rotor Blade and Method of Replacement" and U. S.
Patent Number 4,863,348 granted to W. P. Weinhold on
September 5, 1989 entitled "Blade, Especially a Rotor
Blade". Each of these patents disclose means for
aerodynamically reducing the effective gap by
injecting cooling air discharging from internally of
the blade to a location that will effectively create
a buffer zone to prevent the

A turbine blade for a gas turbine engine, said
blade (40) having a solid airfoil portion, a pressure

surface (46), a suction surface (48), a leading edge
(50), a trailing edge (52), a root section (44) and a

tip section (42), said airfoil being subjected in use to
the fluid working medium of the engine, and comprising

means for minimizing the tendency of said medium to
bypass the blade's working surface, characterised by

said means including at least one passageway (54)
extending into the solid portion of said airfoil from a

point in the pressure side of the blade to a point
adjacent to the tip section (42) at the pressure side of

said airfoil portion, said passageway (54) being curved
such that in use a portion of the fluid of said fluid

working medium will be conducted through said curved
passageway (56) and discharged adjacent to said tip

section (42) in a direction opposing the flow stream of
said fluid working medium, so as to reduce the tendency

of said fluid from bypassing said working surface.
A turbine blade for a gas turbine engine, said
blade having an airfoil section, a pressure surface

(46), a suction surface (48), a leading edge (50), a
trailing edge (52), a root section (44) and a tip

section (42), internal passage means (62) in said
airfoil for leading cooling air from said root section

(44) toward said tip section (42), additional internal
passage means (64) interconnecting said internal passage

means (62) and discharge holes (70) formed in said
airfoil, said airfoil having a working surface subjected

in use to the fluid working medium of the engine, and
having means for minimizing the tendency of said medium

to bypass the working surface, characterised by said
means including at least one passageway (66) extending

into said additional internal passage (64) and extending 
from a point intersecting said additional internal

passage (64) to a point adjacent to the tip section (42)
at the pressure side of said airfoil section, said

passageway (66) being curved such that in use a portion
of the fluid in said additional internal passage will be

conducted through said curved passageway (66) and

is generally C-shaped.
A turbine blade as claimed in claim 3 wherein said
generally C-shaped passageway (54;66) is rectangular in

cross section.
A turbine blade as claimed in any preceding claim
including a plurality of said passageways (54;66)

extending in a chordwise direction from the leading edge
(50) to the trailing edge (52) of the blade.
