<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light
decolorizable recording material excellent in stability
to the light of a fluorescent lamp or the like, which is
decolorized when a visible radiation is applied thereto,
and a toner or ink containing this light decolorizable
recording material as a colorant.In the technical fields such as printing and
copying, the environmental resistance of recording
materials, i.e. shelf stabilities such as light fastness,
moisture resistance, solvent resistance, and heat
resistance have attracted the attention of the industrial
world, and improvements of the physical properties of the
recording materials have extensively been carried out.
Especially, in the fields of electronic photographic
recording and electrostatic recording, developments have
extensively been put forward. For example, in electronic
photographic recording, many processes are known, as
disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2297691 Specification,
Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 42-23910,
Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 43-24748, and
the like, and according to these processes, an electric
latent image is formed on a light-sensitive material by
various means, using a photoconductive substance in
general, and the formed latent image is subsequently
developed with a toner, so as to be converted into a
visible image, whereafter the toner image is transferred
to a transfer material such as paper, if necessary, and
thereafter fixed by heating or pressurization, so as to
obtain a copied image. In addition, various developing
methods of visualizing an electrostatic latent image with
a toner have been known (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 2874063 
Specification, U.S. Pat. No. 2618552 Specification, and
U.S. Pat. No. 2221776 Specification). The toner used in
the above heat fixing method is prepared generally by
fusedly mixing a colorant such as carbon black and an
additive such as electric charge regulator into a
thermoplastic resin such as a styrene-butyl acrylate
copolymer, so as to be uniformly dispersed, and
pulverizing the obtained mixture to a desired particle
size by a pulverizing mill or a dispersing machine, after
cooling of the mixture. In addition, in the fields such
as printing and copying; coloring of materials has
recently been spread, and the improvement of the physical
properties of colorant, electric charge regulator and the
like has extensively been carried out (e.g. Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57-130046, Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57-191650). Further,
