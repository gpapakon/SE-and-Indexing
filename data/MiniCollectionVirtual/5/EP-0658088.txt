<ABSTRACT>
In an "espresso" coffee maker, thermal conditions necessary for the best coffee dispensation are maintained by using at least a thermal activated valve (22, 42, 62, 72, 92, 112) in the hydraulic circuit (11, 31, 51, 81, 101) of the coffee maker. Preferably, the thermal activated valve comprises a bias element (27, 47, 67, 77, 97, 117) made of a shape-memory material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an "espresso" coffee maker of a 
top-quality professional type. The quality of coffee prepared on an "espresso" coffee 
maker is dependent on a variety of factors, which are 
tied both to the coffee used, namely its blend, quality 
and grinding grade, and the coffee maker itself, 
specifically the machine processing rate, operating 
pressure and water temperature. As may be appreciated, 
the choice of the machine-dependent parameters will be 
influenced by the coffee-dependent ones; it is for the 
designer to set these parameters and design the machine 
to keep such parameters continual as far as possible, 
irrespective of the operating conditions encountered, 
which may vary a great deal. In particular, the temperature of the dispensation water 
flowed through the percolator loaded with a charge of 
ground coffee is recognized to be critical. Also well-recognized 
is that that temperature is quite difficult to 
control because it is readily affected by the machine own 
conditions of operation. To provide ideal dispensation conditions, the machine may 
be equipped with indicator gauges to tell the operator 
whether the time is right for coffee dispensation or 
additional time should be allowed in order for the 
optimum temperature to be attained. This approach would 
only suit those applications where operators of adequate 
skill can be detached to supervise the coffee-making 
operation and continuously monitor the machine, and  
 
especially where the downtime involved in waiting for the 
ideal conditions to set in would not be objectionable. But since such conditions are hardly met in practice, it 
remains for the machine itself to maintain best heating 
conditions for coffee making. Accordingly, certain water supply systems have been 
developed which, additionally to supplying the dispenser 
units, provide for heat exchanges to occur within the 
machine between areas at different temperatures liable to 
swing in opposite directions during operation of the 
machine, thereby compensating to some extent for local 
temperature variations. Such water supply systems are calibrated, as by the 
inclusion of waterflow throttling or metering 
passageways, for normal operating conditions; their 
effectiveness being lost under extreme conditions, such 
as during the machine turn-on transient or where large 
amounts of water are to be delivered in close succession 
(e.g. to dispense weaker coffee, as may typically be the 
case in Northern Countries). A coffee maker is disclosed by
