<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the production of cast strands from metals, especially steels, by continuous casting in vertical or curved-path installations, the molten metal level in the mould is recorded continuously by a continuously acting measurement system and held constant, preferably automatically, by means of a semi-automatic or fully-automatic control system; the inflow of metal into the mould from a distributor is adjusted by varying the outflow cross-section and the molten metal level in the mould is held constant by continuous adaptation of the strand withdrawal speed. A change in the outflow cross-section can be effected by adjusting a casting plug or by actuating a sliding gate plate known per se and a change in the casting rate can be effected by changing the outflow cross-section.
