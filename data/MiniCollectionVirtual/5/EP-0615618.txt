Method of measuring the fluorescence feedback of algae in
order to determine the density and vitality of the algae with an

exciting light, the fluorescent radiation of the tested plants
being detected, characterised by


exposing the algae simultaneously to two differently timed
light signals, a measurement light timed at a quick rhythm

and a second x-Hz light timed at a slow rhythm,
correlating the detected signal with the timing signal of
the measurement light in order to obtain an intermediate

signal which is definitive for the density of the algae,
and
correlating the intermediate signal with the timing signal
of the x-Hz light in order to obtain a calibratable result

signal which is definitive for the vitality,
integrating both signals.
Method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the
attenuation of the light in the algae is determined using an

attenuation measuring device.
Method as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the algae are successively excited with

different light wavelengths.
Method of determining the pollutants in water, e.g. waste
water, as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised

by the following steps: 

a proportion of clean water is mixed with algae and the
first algae vitality value is determined,
a proportion of the pollutant to be detected, e.g.
nitrate, is mixed with algae and the second algae

vitality value is determined,
a proportion of the water to be tested is mixed with
algae and the third algae vitality value is determined,
the third algae vitality value is compared with the
first two and the pollutant content in the water to be

tested is determined.
Apparatus for carrying out the method as claimed in one
of Claims 1 to 4 for measuring the fluorescence feedback of

algae in order to determine the density and vitality of the
algae, in which a light which excites the fluorescence of the

algae is provided and the fluorescent radiation of the tested
plants is detected, characterised in that


a lighting device (10, 12) is provided which has two
simultaneously effective and differently timed light

signals, a first measurement light timed at a quick
rhythm and a second x-Hz light timed at a slow rhythm,
a first photodetector (14) is provided for detecting the
two light signals,
a first correlator (24) is provided for correlating the
detected signal with the timing signal of the

measurement light in order to obtain an intermediate
signal which is definitive for the density of the algae,

a second correlator (24) is provided for correlating the
intermediate signal with the timing signal of the x-Hz

light in order to obtain a calibratable result signal
which is definitive for the vitality,
an integrator (26) is provided in each case for
integrating each of the two signals, and
a temperature sensor connected to a measurement chamber
(47) for measuring the temperature of the volume of fluid

in the measurement chamber is provided.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that a
conveying device is provided and is constructed as a hose pump

(43).
Apparatus as claimed in one of Claims 5 or 6,
characterised in that on the measurement chamber (16) there is

disposed a third light source (74) with which is associated a
second photodetector (75) which measures the density and/or the

attenuation of the light of the third light source in the algae.
Apparatus as claimed in one of Claims 5 to 7,
characterised in that the measurement chamber has an injection

opening (72) and an outlet (73) associated therewith.
Apparatus as claimed in one of Claims 5 to 8,
characterised in that the measurement chamber has a mixing

device (71).
Apparatus as claimed in one of Claims 5 to 9,
characterised in that the apparatus has one or more of the

following devices: an attenuation measuring device (52), a
pressure measuring device (53), a conductivity measuring device

(54), an oxygen or other gas measuring device (55), a switch
clock.
Measurement station with apparatus as claimed in one of
Claims 5 to 10, characterised in that the measurement station

has a measurement data gathering and/or evaluating device which
centrally controls all devices of the apparatus, receives

measured data and stores the measured data in a storage device
(58). 
Measurement station with apparatus as claimed in one of
Claims 5 to 10, characterised in that the measurement station

has a measurement data gathering and/or evaluating device
which centrally controls all devices of the apparatus,

receives measured data and stores the measured data in a
storage device (58).
