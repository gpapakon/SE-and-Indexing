<ABSTRACT>
This invention aims at stabilizing the operating frequency of a compressor so as to prevent hunting in noise and improve 
the durability of the compressor. A means (41) for controlling the operating frequency of a compressor (1), and a resistor (R2) for 

detecting an electric current flowing in the compressor (1) are provided. A means (42) for reducing a frequency step (N) of a compressor 
motor (MC) at a predetermined speed when the supply current from the compressor motor (MC) has reached a predetermined 

level (Is), and a frequency holding means (43) for terminating the frequency step reducing operation of the frequency reducing 
means (42) when the supply current from the compressor motor (MC) has been reduced to the predetermined level (Is), and 

holding the current frequency step (N) until a predetermined period of time has elapsed are also provided. In addition to these 
means, a means for increasing the frequency step (N) at a speed lower than the above-mentioned predetermined speed until a 

predetermined period of time has elapsed when the frequency step holding operation of the frequency holding means (43) has 
finished, so that the supply current from the compressor motor (MC) reaches the predetermined level (Is) is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an operation
control apparatus for an air conditioner, and in
particular, to a current decreasing control of a motor for
driving a compressor.Conventionally, there has been an air conditioner
wherein a compressor of which capacity is controlled by an
inverter, a four-way directional control valve, an outdoor
heat exchanger, an electrically operated expansion valve,
and an indoor heat exchanger are serially connected to one
another, and wherein a frequency of the inverter is
controlled based on a temperature difference between a room
temperature and a set temperature to control the capacity
of the compressor by increasing and decreasing the capacity
('89 Daikin skyair technical guide <service parts list>,
issued in june 1989, p. 244).When a supply current to a motor built in the
compressor reaches a specified value in a stage in which a
high load is applied to the compressor, the operating 
frequency is reduced to prevent the supply current from
abnormally increasing.In the above-mentioned air conditioner, the
control of the current supplied to the motor of the
compressor is effected in a manner as follows. As shown in
Fig. 7, there is provided a decreasing interval X1 in which
the operating frequency is reduced in steps when the supply
current (DC current before the inverter) flowing through
the motor of the compressor reaches a specified value Is
lower than a peak current Im. There is further provided a
retaining interval X2 in which the present operating
frequency is retained for three minutes when the supply
current reduces to a level below the specified value Is.
After escaping from the retaining interval X2, the current
control enters into a normal control operation.However, in the above-mentioned current control
operation, there is such a problem that the operating
frequency hunts to cause noise to cyclically change to
offend the ear. Furthermore, there is another problem that
the durability of the compressor reduces due to the hunting
of the operating frequency.The present invention was made in view of the
aforementioned problems, and it is an object of the present
invention to prevent the possible hunting of noise by 
stabilizing the operating frequency and improve the
durability of the compressor.In order to achieve the aforementioned object,
the present invention takes measures of retaining an
operating frequency at a specified value, and thereafter
gradually increasing the operating frequency.Practically as shown in Fig. 1, the measures of
the invention

detection signal from the current detecting means (R2), and

when the supply current of the compressor (1) is reduced to a
specified value, makes the frequency reducing means (42)

complete frequency reducing operation and retain a present
operating frequency until a specified time elapses; and
frequency increasing means (44) which outputs an

increase signal for increasing the operating frequency at a
speed slower than the predetermined speed to the frequency

control means (41) so that the supply current of the 
compressor (1) comes to have a specified value until a

specified time elapses when retaining operation of the
frequency retaining means (43) is completed.
