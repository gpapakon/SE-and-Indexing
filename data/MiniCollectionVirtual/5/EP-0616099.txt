<ABSTRACT>
A disc for use with an automatic swimming pool 
cleaner which operates on a substantial 

intermittent reduction in water flow through the 
swimming pool cleaner, the disc being made of 

flexible material and having grooves formed 
symmetrically across and into the under surface of 

the disc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to discs which are used on 
certain kinds of swimming pool cleaners primarily 
to hold the pool cleaner against the surface which 
is to be cleaned. These discs are made of flexible material so that 
they can, under operating conditions, follow the  
 
contours of the floor and walls of a swimming pool. 
Particularly the flexibility enables the swimming pool 
cleaner to traverse the corner formed between vertical and 
horizontal surfaces. Usually, a compromise must be 
reached in obtaining the desired flexibility while still 
maintaining the disc properly functional under the suction 
induced by water flow through the cleaner. It is the object of this invention to provide a 
disc which not only improves operation of the pool cleaner 
with which it is used but will also facilitate packing for 
transport and storage. US-A-4 193 156, on which the preamble of claim 1 
is based, discloses a disc for a suction operated pool 
cleaner, the perimetral region of which is corrugated or 
wrinkled and has a number of concertina-like folds. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a disc for a suction operated swimming pool 
cleaner, made of flexible material and having a central 
aperture to engage around the head of the suction operated 
pool cleaner, wherein grooves are formed symmetrically 
into and across the surface of the disc which is arranged 
to engage a pool surface to be cleaned, characterised in 
that the grooves extend from the periphery of the disc to 
said central aperture.  
 Further features of this invention provide for the 
grooves to be at least predominantly radially 
located or for a pair of grooves spaced apart on 
each side of a diametrical centre line to be 
provided or for a combination of both patterns of 
grooves to be provided. The invention also provides for the grooves to be 
about 5 mms wide and to extend to a depth about 
three quarters through the thickness of the disc 
material. Preferred examples of this invention are described 
below with reference to the accompanying drawings 
in which 
Figs 1 to 3illustrate different patterns 
of grooves Figs 4 and 5illustrate two ways of folding 
the discs and Fig 6is a detail. The flexible disc (1) with which this invention is 
concerned may be used with different kinds of 
suction operated pool cleaner which consist 
essentially of a head having a passage 
therethrough. The inlet end of the passage opens in 
use adjacent to the surface being cleaned and the 
disc fits around the head adjacent the inlet.

<CLAIMS>
A disc (1) for a suction operated swimming 
pool cleaner, made of flexible material and having a 

central aperture to engage around the head of the suction 
operated pool cleaner, wherein grooves (3,4) are formed 

symmetrically into and across the surface of the disc 
which is arranged to engage a pool surface to be cleaned, 

characterised in that the grooves (3,4) extend from the 
periphery of the disc to said central aperture. 
A disc as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the grooves (4) are symmetrically located and 

extend predominantly radially across the under surface of 
the disc (1). 
A disc as claimed in claim 1, wherein a pair 
of parallel grooves (3) are provided symmetrically one on 

each side of a diametrical line across the disc (1). 
A disc as claimed in claim 1, wherein a 
combination of grooves (3,4) defined in claims 2 and 3 are 

provided. 
A disc as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
disc (1) is made of polyurethane of 82A hardness and the 

grooves extend about three-quarters through the thickness 
of the disc material. 
A disc as claimed in claim 5, wherein the 
grooves (3,4) are 5 mm wide and 2.5 mm deep.
