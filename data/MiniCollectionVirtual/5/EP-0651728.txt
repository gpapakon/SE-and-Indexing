<ABSTRACT>
A process for extracting alumina from bauxite comprising the steps of concentratring a portion of spent caustic liquor (18), combining said concentrated spent caustic liquor with a bauxite slurry (3) to provide a final alumina to caustic ratio (A/C) of greater than 0.7 in the slurry/liquor mixture, heating the mixture by means of a heat exchanger (5), subjecting the mixture to digestion in a tank (7) at a temperature below that at which reversion of dissolved gibbsite to boehmite may occur to thereby extract alumina from the gibbsite bauxite in the slurry, separating the high alumina pregnant liquor (9) from the boehmite containing residue in a pressure decanter (8), mixing the residue with the remaining portion of unconcentrated spent caustic liquor (18) and subjecting the mixture to high temperature digestion in a tank (11) to extract the remaining alumina from the residue, subjecting the digested mixture to flash cooling in flash tanks (13), and separating the alumina rich liquors from the high alumina pregnant liquor and from the digested mixture in an atmospheric separator (14) or a pressure decanter (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR EXTRACTING ALUMINA FROM BAUXITEField of the InventionThis invention relates to processes for the production of alumina from bauxite. Background of the Invention GeneralMost alumina is produced using the Bayer process. A high volume of caustic liquor is circulated at a controlled concentration. In the digestion part of the circuit, the caustic is heated and reacted with bauxite to increase the alumina concentration (pregnant liquor) . After the bauxite residue is separated by settling, the caustic liquor is cooled, seeded, and alumina is precipitated as product. The spent liquor is recirculated.The quantity of circulating liquor can be as high as 20 m3/t alumina produced. Expressed in terms of productivity, this is only 50 g/litre. To increase production of existing plants or to reduce the capital cost of new plants, it is important to achieve high yield. Only a few alumina plants are achieving +80 g/1 yield today.For high yield, the digestion step has to achieve a high alumina concentration. A degree of supersaturation can be tolerated during the residue separation step. However, depending on certain factors, there is a limiting supersaturation above which alumina will be lost in increasing amounts to the residue.Usually the digestion system operates at the highest flowrate that the equipment and steam heating will allow. Bauxite is then added in a controlled manner to achieve a desired pregnant liquor alumina concentration.The alumina concentration is usually expressed as a ratio on caustic, A/C. As an example, the pregnant liquor can be 0.72 A/C (gAl203/gNa2C03) at say 105Â°C for 200 g/1 caustic expressed as Na2C03 (representing sodium hydroxide associated with the dissolved alumina as well as free sodium hydroxide) . The spent liquor A/C will depend on precipitation conditions but can be say 0.37 A/C. Free CausticUsually the spent liquor to digestion is evaporated to some degree and fresh caustic make-up added at this point, such that 

the concentration may be 240 g/1 caustic at 0.36 A/C. The so called free caustic of this liquor is defined as: 240 - 240 x 0.36 x 106/102 = 150 g/1. (representing sodium hydroxide)Depending on the velocity and temperature of the liquor heating to digestion, there will be an upper limit for free caustic. For a high temperature process required to digest boehmitic or diasporic bauxites the limit may be say 140 g/1 free caustic. Above this limit the heater tubes and piping may erode/corrode rapidly.One way of dropping the free caustic is to add bauxite that
