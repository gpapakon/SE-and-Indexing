<ABSTRACT>
A composite reagent, for a veterinary diagnostic 
test, which contains a color reagent substance to produce 

a color by reacting with either one or both of magnesium 
(Mg) ions and calcium (Ca) ions, a polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl 

ether, and a masking agent for interfering metal 
ions in a urine of an animal other than the Mg ions and 

the Ca ions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite reagent 
for a veterinary diagnostic test, which helps in diagnosing 
or confirming the presence of a urinary calculus and 
diseases of the urinary tract in animals involving pets 
such as dogs and cats. The diseases of the animal urinary tract have prevailed 
in recent years among many of pets such as dogs and 
cats, and the incidence of such diseases is now increasing. 
Major causes of such diseases have been hitherto 
asserted to lay in that the pets have physical discomfort 
due to lack of exercise because many of pets are kept 
indoors by a recent change of urbanized human living 
environment, and in that the ready-made foods sold for 
pets are limited in kinds and so biased in nutrition. 
However, the true causes have not yet been finally determined. Accordingly, in the field of veterinary medicine, it 
is required to counteract the expansion of the diseases of  
 
the animal urinary tract with a simple method of diagnosing 
such diseases by external observation. However, in 
the status quo, an externally observable diagnostic test 
in itself is not established which meets such a simple 
method, because there have been found no practical reagent 
and means which are useful for such a test and can detect 
the diseases of the animal urinary tract. Incidentally, 
there was previously an assertion that the diagnosis of 
the above-mention diseases could be made by measuring the 
pH value of the urine taken from an animal, on the assumption 
that an alkaline urine was relevant to such diseases. 
However, it has been proven that the relationship does not 
always exist between the alkaline urine and such diseases 
because phosphorus (P) ions or the like from the pet food 
affects strongly the urine. It is, therefore, an objective of the present invention 
to provide a composite reagent which can provide a 
veterinary observable diagnostic test for practical use as 
a countermeasure against the expansion of the diseases of 
the animal urinary tract, i.e. to provide a composite 
reagent which can detect the relevant factors of the 
diseases of the animal urinary tract from the animal urine 
quantitatively by a process of chemical color reaction  
 
therewith so as to make it possible to diagnose the 
presence and degree of such diseases correctly by external 
observation of coloration of a test solution and then try 
an appropriate measure against such diseases. It is another objective of the present invention to 
provide a composite reagent, for a veterinary
