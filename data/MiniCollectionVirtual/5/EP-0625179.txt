<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the processing
of crude coal tar to separate and recover valuable chemicals
and compositions therefrom. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a process for obtaining an increased
yield of coal tar pitch from the distillation of a crude coal
tar material, and to the pitch product thus obtained.As general background, the destructive, dry distillation
or carbonization of coal yields a liquid condensate, most of
which is coal tar. Usually, the coal tar amounts to some 3%
of the coal, and is a dark, thick liquid or semi-solid at
ambient temperatures. This coal tar includes a mixture of
aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, naphthalene,
anthracene, xylene and others, phenol bodies such as phenol,
cresols, xylenols and others, ammonia, and pyridine and other
organic bases, etc.Upon redistillation of coal tar, several aromatic
fractions are obtained usually boiling at temperatures up to
about 360°C. These fractions can be further processed by
distillation, extraction or other techniques to recover
individual or mixed components in a more purified form.As an example, in an initial phase, ammonia and other
gases are separated from crude tar after which the tar is
distilled in an operation termed "topping" to separate a
first fraction containing certain chemical substituents from
higher boiling, more viscous constituents. The distillate
from topping commonly termed "chemical oil", has an upper
boiling point of about 250°C and contains tar acids (i.e. the
phenolic bodies), naphthalene and tar bases including
pyridine and others. The tar acids usually constitute about 1 to 5% by weight
of the crude coal tar, and can be recovered by extraction of
the chemical oil with aqueous alkali, e.g. a caustic
solution. The aqueous layer is separated from the acid free
oil, whereafter the phenols are reconverted to crude form by
acidification of the aqueous solution (termed "springing"),
The crude phenolics may then be fractionated to obtain
phenol, cresols, and higher boiling phenolics such as
xylenols.Further fractions commonly taken in the distillation of
coal tar are sometimes called "creosote" fractions or heavy
oils, while coal tar pitch is recovered as a residue left
behind from such a coal tar distillation.This residual coal tar pitch has itself proven to be a
highly valuable item of commerce. Coal tar pitch is used for
many purposes including, importantly, its use as a binder for
carbon and graphite in the formation of carbon bodies and
can, for example,

<CLAIMS>
A process for obtaining an increased
pitch yield from crude coal tar while producing a

binder pitch, 
characterised by
 treating a crude
coal tar material having a tar acid content of

1 to 5 weight percent by reaction with
formaldehyde in a molar ratio of at least 1:2 with

respect to the tar acids for a period of at least
1 hour at a temperature of at least 40°C,

distilling said treated coal tar material taking
fractions that boil up to 360°C.
The process of Claim 1 wherein prior to
the distillation the coal tar material is treated

with formaldehyde in at least a 1:1 molar
ratio with respect to the tar acid content.
The process of Claim 2 wherein prior to
the distillation the coal tar is treated with

formaldehyde for at least two hours with 
agitation to promote the formaldehyde reaction

with the crude coal tar material.
The process of Claim 3 wherein prior to
the distillation the coal tar material is treated

with formaldehyde at a temperature in the range of
50°-180°C.
The process of Claim 1 which includes the
steps of mixing and heating the crude coal tar

material and the formaldehyde in a first tank,
transferring the mixture to a still, distilling

the mixture to leave a pitch residue in the still,
and blowing the still to recover the pitch.
The process of Claim 1 wherein the crude
coal tar material is crude coal tar or a mixture

of crude coal tar and a coal tar distillation
fraction.
The process of Claim 1 wherein prior to
the distillation the coal tar material is treated

with formaldehyde in a 1-4:2 molar ratio
with respect to the tar acid content.
