<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector assembly (10) is 
disclosed for connecting a mating connector to a printed 

circuit board (12). The assembly includes a dielectric 
housing (14) having a plurality of terminal-receiving 

cavities (30) and a plurality of terminals (16) insertable 
into the cavities. Each terminal includes a base section 

(18) insertable into a respective cavity in an insertion 
direction for securing the terminal in the cavity. The 

terminal includes a tail section (20) for contacting the 
printed circuit board and spring contact beam (22) for 

electrically engaging a conductor of the mating connector. 
The tail section and the spring contact beam extend from 

the base section and are spaced apart transverse to the 
insertion direction, whereby an insertion tool can be 

inserted therebetween into engagement with the base section 
to readily force the terminal into its terminal-receiving 

cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to an electrical 
connector assembly which includes a unique terminal 
construction for facilitating insertion of the terminal 
into a connector housing. Various electrical connector assemblies 
such as that described for example in US-A-5 203 725 
include 
terminals which have base sections for securing the 
terminals in a dielectric housing of the connector 
assembly. Other portions of the terminals, such as contact 
means, solder tails, spring contact arms, etc. project from 
the rigidly secured base sections of the terminals. Such 
a terminal may be fabricated as a stamped and formed sheet 
metal component, with the base section of the terminal 
being forced into a cavity in the dielectric housing. The 
base section may include barbs along opposite edges thereof 
for skiving into the material of the housing to rigidly 
secure the terminal in its cavity. For instance, these types of terminals are used 
in recharging and data retrieval apparatus, such as a 
portable telephone. A hand held phone set is positionable 
into and removed from a cradle formed by a base unit. The 
hand held phone set has exposed contact means, and the base 
unit often has a plurality of spring contact arms exposed 
thereon for engaging the contact means of the hand held 
phone set, such as for recharging the batteries thereof. 
The terminals of the base unit include base sections 
insertable into cavities in a dielectric housing to secure  
 
the terminals thereon, with the spring contact arms 
projecting from the base sections for engaging the contact 
means of the hand held phone set. The terminals also may 
include solder tails for engaging circuit traces on a 
circuit board within the base unit. One of the problems with such electrical 
connector apparatus involves mounting or inserting the 
terminals into their respective cavities. Insertion tools 
often are used for inserting the terminals into their 
cavities, and the insertion forces must be transmitted to 
the base sections of the terminals which are rigidly 
secured to the housing. With the spring contact arm and 
the tail section of a given terminal projecting from the 
base section thereof, heretofore there has been no area 
left for an insertion tool to directly engage the base 
section. Obviously, the spring contact arm is too flexible 
for receiving insertion forces. When insertion forces are 
applied by a tool to the tail section of the terminal, too 
small a surface area
