<ABSTRACT>
A dual-layered cushion (10) for use by an animal, 
which accommodates the animal's bedding-down behavioural 

pattern while preventing the shape of the cushion from 
being excessively distorted by the animal's action has a 

superstratum (12) constructed such that the animal in 
preparing to lie on it can and normally will disturb its 

shape, by moving loosely-packed fill (12b) (according to 
one embodiment) from one part of the superstratum to 

another, and a base layer (14) supporting the superstratum 
such as to limit the degree to which the shape of the 

superstratum can be disturbed in this fashion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cushions for pets, and is
directed more particularly to the orthopedic support of
dogs at rest and especially, toward accommodating the
instinctive and epimeletic (self-care) behavior
exhibited by dogs known as the "bedding-down" or
"nesting" instinct, while simultaneously achieving the
secondary goal of lessening the destructive effects of
pets on household furniture.Dogs exhibit a definite pattern of epimeletic
behavior prior to resting, called the "bedding-down" or
"nesting" instinct ("instinct" being understood here as
the taking of an action automatically, without
premeditation and without prior learning of the
action). The bedding-down instinct is generally
characterized by the animal circling two or three times
on one spot and digging at the ground with the forepaws
or nose, giving the appearance of creating an imaginary
hole. There is no consensus among experts as to the
origin of this behavior and what it achieves. Whitney
(Leon Whitney, D.V.M., in Dog Psychology - The Basis of
Dog Training, publ. Chas. C. Thomas, 1964) hypothesizes
that the dog's forebears, living as they did in
grasslands, had to make nests in the grass by turning
around and trampling out a bed for themselves. A
related theory contends that this action was meant to
scare away snakes and scorpions (mentioned but disputed
by Eberhard Trumler, Understanding Your Dog, publ.
Faber & Faber, 1973). Neither hypothesis, however, can
explain the existence of the instinct in all breeds
regardless of their origin.Vine (Louis L. Vine, D.V.M., Behavior and Training
of Dogs and Puppies, publ. Arco Publishing, 1977)
contends that the circling motion was more likely an
effort to detect the direction of the wind before
bedding down so that by placing the nose in an up-wind
direction, the dog could more readily detect the scent
of approaching enemies. This explanation of the
behavior is also rejected by many experts, some of whom
favor a less Darwinian explanation. For instance, one
authority contends that cats and dogs are inherently
comfort-loving creatures and will attempt to create a
softer nest by pawing the ground. This behavior is
exhibited in the wild by wolves and feral dogs who
often seek out a tree with exposed roots and rearrange
the leaves before bedding down in them. Additionally,
all domesticated animals, with the exception of horses,
sleep in a curled-up position, which helps them to
thermoregulate, and the turning motion may, as
hypothesized by Kurt F. Konig (reported by Trumler, op.
cit.), be an action

<CLAIMS>
A cushion (10) for use by an animal, comprising a superstratum
(12), having an exposed surface for the animal to lie on, and having such a

construction that the animal can disturb the shape of said superstratum by
stepping, pawing, circling or lying on said exposed surface; characterised in that

a base layer (14) is provided to support said superstratum (12) in such fashion
as to limit the degree to which said shape of said superstratum (12) can be

disturbed by the animal, and in that first and second covers (12a, 14a) encase

said superstratum (12) and said base layer (14) respectively.
A cushion (10) according to claim 1, further comprising an outer
casing (16) containing said superstratum (12), said base layer (14) and said

respective covers (12a, 14a).
A cushion (10) according to claim 2, wherein said outer casing
(16) comprises a removable cover, which can be removed from said cushion, for

cleaning and be replaced thereafter.
A cushion (30) according to claim 1, wherein said base layer (34)
has an upper surface in which is defined a recess (36), and wherein said

superstratum (32) is received in said recess (36).
A cushion according to claim 1, wherein said base layer (14)
comprises a firm cushioning element as means by which said base layer retains

its shape.
A cushion according to claim 5, wherein said cushioning element
is made of a synthetic foam (14b).
A cushion according to claim 5, wherein said superstratum (12) 
further comprises a cover and loosely-packed fill (12b) contained in said cover.
