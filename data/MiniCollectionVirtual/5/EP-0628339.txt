<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of removing undesirable substances 
in a gas simultaneously with extracting substances during removal 

which may be reused as end products or recycled in the process. 
The method relates in particular to the removal of nitrogeneous and 
sulphurous compounds. Moreover, according to this method it is possible 

to remove carbon dioxide and any compounds containing NO
x
. The method 
features simplicity and easy use in situ where cleaning of the 

gas is desired. Furthermore, this method only applies chemical processes 
which are able to take place under process conditions which do 

not make heavy demands on process equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of removing from a
biogas carbon dioxide and sulphur and nitrogen containing
compounds originating from anaerobic decomposition of
biological material.Various methods wherein a purification of gases is performed
are known from SU-B-814,414, SU-B-768,440 and JP-A-54,100,975. All
of these publications relate to removal of H2S during formation
of ferric hydroxide. Further methods are known for
removal of mercaptans and for removal of NOx, e.g. with the
use of active carbon.The disadvantage of the known methods is that they do not to
a sufficient extent permit the removal of many of the
undesirable substances comprised in gases of the above-mentioned
kind. Besides, many of the processes used in the
prior art are very complicated and unsuitable for use in
situ, e.g. on a farm. Finally, the prior art does not show
how substances that are removed may be reused.Various patents, such as DE-A-3,412,581 are known wherein
formalin is used for various objects and wherein the use of
formalin serves to remove ammonia and hydrogen cyanide
during formation of (CH2)6N4 and CH2(OH)CN. While both
ammonia and HCN are excellent nucleophile reagents which
both react readily with formalin, hydrogen sulphide is a
comparatively less ready nucleophile and will, therefore,
react very slowly unless a catalyst is present.DE-A-424,596 uses low concentrations of formalin
which, combined with said metallic salts, shifts the balance
of the ammonium carbonate in the manure on one hand towards
ammonium chloride and on the other hand towards calcium- or
magnesium carbonate , both of which are precipitated, and
the ammonia is bound in an ammonium form which is free of 
smell and no longer volatile. Here the amount of formalin
binds ammonia as a water-soluble product NH2CH2OH
analogously with DE-A-3,412,581.The patent applications PCT WO-A-93/006063 and the patent GB-A-1,538,661 are prior art
wherein ammonia is captured in an acid solution during
formation of ammonium ions and respective anions, here
sulphate and phosphate which are both water-soluble, that
means they are not precipitated as precipitates.As disclosed in DK patents 17,226 and 19,403, these both use
a different regeneration procedure for the trivalent
metallic oxyhydroxyde (FeOOH). The precipitated sulphurous
compounds are also of a different type.GB-A-673,187 and GB-A-879,112 do not describe a
regenerating method of removing hydrogen sulphide, but
rather use of an iron(II)sulphate in an alcaline solution for
the formation of
