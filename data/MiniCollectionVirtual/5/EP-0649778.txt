<ABSTRACT>
In a safety arrangement, a shaped body (24) is seated in at least one end of a tension bar (18) formed from a tube, the exterior part of which shaped body constitutes a guide for a retaining member (21), while the interior part (25) of the shaped body constitutes a deformation body which is deformed by a correspondingly thickened end (45) of the retaining member if an object is slung into the safety net.

Security net installation for protecting the passenger
compartment of estate cars relative to the luggage

compartment,

with a security net (14) having two edges (16) which are
substantially parallel to one another,
with a fixing arrangement (15) associated with one edge in
order to connect the security net (14) to the estate car in

the region of this edge,
with a bar-like fixing arrangement (18) which is fixed on the
other edge (16) and contains at least at one of its ends an

elongated cavity which leads from the end in question into the
fixing arrangement (18) and of which the longitudinal axis is

coaxial with the longitudinal axis of the fixing arrangement
(18),
with a tubular insert (24) which goes into the cavity and is
fixed in the cavity, and
with a retaining member (19) which has a shank (36) and which
with its shank (36) fits displaceably into the interior of the

insert (24), the end of the shank (36) which projects out of
the fixing arrangement (18) bearing an anchoring member (21)

which is to be inserted into a receptacle (23) fixed in the
estate car,
with a spring member (41) which acts between the insert (24)
and the retaining member (19) and by which the retaining

member (19) is pretensioned in an end position with regard to
the insert (24).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that energy-absorbing means (25) are

provided.
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 2,
characterised in that the energy-absorbing means (25) are

disposed kinematically between the fixing arrangement (18) and
the retaining member (19).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 1,
characterised in that the fixing arrangement (18) containing

the cavity is a tube.
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 4,
characterised in that the tube is cylindrical.
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 1,
characterised in that the opening (27) in the insert (24) is

substantially cylindrical.
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 6,
characterised in that the opening (27) in the insert (24) has

a portion (29) which is widened in diameter in order to
receive the spring member (41).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 7,
characterised in that the widened portion (29) tapers towards

both ends and that the widened portion (29) has a lateral
opening for the insertion of the spring member (41).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 1,
characterised in that the retaining member (19) is secured

against rotation in the insert (24).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 1,
characterised in that for securing against rotation the insert

(24) has a groove (38) which extends in the longitudinal 
direction and is open towards the opening (27) and that the

retaining member (19) bears a radial extension (39) which
engages in the groove (38).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 10,
characterised in that the radial extension (39) is a

protuberance produced by stamping.
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 10,
characterised in that the groove (38) is open towards the

outer end of the insert (24).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 1,
characterised in that the insert (24) contains in its outer

circumferential surface at least one depression (47), if
appropriate in the shape of a circumferential groove, and that

at least one bead (48) is stamped into the fixing arrangement
(18) in the region of the depression (47) and axially secures

the insert (24) in the fixing arrangement (18).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 1,
characterised in that the insert (24) has a radially

projecting flange (26) on its end which lies outside in the
inserted state.
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 1,
characterised in that a tubular deformation body is provided

as energy-absorbing means (25) in the cavity and has passing
through it the shank (36) of the retaining member (19) which

is provided with at least one radial extension (46) on its end
(45) which projects beyond the deformation body (25) and is

spaced from the insert (24), in such a way that the retaining
member (19) can only be withdrawn therefrom by deformation of

the deformation body.
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 15, 
characterised in that the deformation body (25) and the insert

(24) are connected to one another, preferably integrally.
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 15,
characterised in that a stop ring (34) is disposed between the

deformation body (25) and the insert (24).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 17,
characterised in that the stop ring (34) lies behind the at

least one bead (48) when viewed from the end of the fixing
arrangement (18).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 17,
characterised in that with integral construction of the

deformation body (25) and the insert (24) the stop ring (34)
lies in a recess (33).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 15,
characterised in that the radial extension (46) is formed by

one of preferably at least two protuberances on the shank (36)
of the retaining member (19).
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 15,
characterised in that the insert (24) and/or the deformation

body (25) is an injection moulded part or are injection
moulded parts.
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 15,
characterised in that the deformation body (25) is a metal

tube, preferably a steel tube.
Security net installation as claimed in Claim 15,
characterised in that the opening (32) in the deformation body

(25) widens slightly conically in the direction away from the
insert (24).
