<ABSTRACT>
A material for absorbing noxious gases while having a good water vapor transmission rate is provided which comprises a suitable flexible substrate of a textile material or a porous organic polymeric membrane having a coating or film on it made of an organic polymer having active hydrogens which presumably react with reaction sites on the noxious gas compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to protective covering materials 
that protect persons inside a garment, tent, sleeping bag or the 
like, or protects inanimate objects from noxious gases, while 
having a high water vapor transmission rate. More specifically, 
this invention is directed to water vapor permeable coated 
materials and coverings made from them which protect persons or 
contents from noxious gases, such as mustard gas and other noxious 
chemical agents. Protective garments that protect the wearer from body contact 
with harmful gases are known, but, in general, they tend to be 
bulky or heavy and/or non-breathable. By non-breathable is meant 
that the garments do not allow passage of water vapor, such as is 
in perspiration given off by the human body. Lack of breathability 
means that perspiration builds up inside the garment and results in 
a close, uncomfortable feeling to the wearer, as well as leading to 
heat stress in the body of the wearer. In addition, many materials that absorb and adsorb noxious 
gases must be applied in heavy, or thick, amounts in order to be 
effective. Use of particulate carbon as an adsorbent can  
 
particularly result in heavy stiff fabric material as the amount of 
carbon present is increased. It is desirable to develop a protective material useful in 
garments or other coverings that is breathable, light-weight, and 
flexible. The protective covering of this invention is a composite of 
a) a pliable substrate that is permeable to water vapor and 
is preferably resistant to penetration by liquid water, and b) a gas-blocking water-vapor-permeable polymeric coating 
comprising a crosslinked polyalkyleneimine or a crosslinked 
polyallylamine, 
said coating forming a gas-blocking barrier on said 
substrate and being present on said substrate in an amount between 
2 and 250 g/m². By "gas-blocking" is meant that gases such as air 
or noxious gases are blocked from passing through the polymeric 
coating. Preferably, the alkylene or allyl moiety is of 2-8 carbon atoms. In one embodiment, the composite is combined with a facing 
and/or a backing fabric to provide protection to the composite. Additional gas blocking materials can be present, as for 
example gas sorbing materials. Figure 1 depicts a composite of the invention in which 
polymeric coating 11 forms a coating on substrate 13. Figure 2 depicts a composite of the invention where the 
polymeric coating 11 partially impregnates pores in substrate 13 as 
well as forms a coating on the surface. Figure 3 depicts a
