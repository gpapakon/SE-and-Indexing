<ABSTRACT>
To facilitate the carrying out of a range of different types of management task in a computer system (such as fault diagnosis and service installation), declarative models (22) are constructed of the various services provided by the system (10-13). These models (22) specify the requirements that need to be met for the corresponding service to be available. These requirements are set out in terms of the system entities that need to be present and the inter-relationships of these entities. In addition, each management task is specified in a corresponding task program (21) in terms of general inferencing operations that can be performed on any of the models. Execution of a particular management task involves carrying out inferencing operations on the appropriate service model (22) in accordance with the task program (21) for the management task under consideration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system management method and apparatus for
carrying out a plurality of management tasks in relation to a plurality of services
intended to be provided by a computer system. In particular, but not exclusively,
the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for facilitating the carrying
out of a number of management tasks (such as installation, monitoring, and fault
diagnosis) in relation to a number of different services (such as log-on, electronic
mail, and print spooling) provided on a network of computers.Over recent years the complexity of computer systems (and in particular, computer
networks) has increased considerably, such systems being characterised by the
interaction of multiple system entities in providing a variety of different services.
One result of this is to have placed a considerable strain on system management
resources tasked to keep such systems up and running. Whilst low-level fault-diagnosis
equipment such as protocol analyzers have evolved generally in line with
the increasing sophistication of the technologies used for inter-linking system
entities, such equipment has often tended only to serve as an aid to a maintenance
engineer, telling him/her what is wrong at the particular point under test. Similarly,
higher-level network management systems that seek to provide an overview of
overall system performance by collecting data from all parts of a network, have
largely been of limited use leaving much of the problem of understanding what is
going on to the network supervisor.More recently, a number of proposals have been made to introduce expert system
technology to network fault diagnosis and management. One network management
system using such technology is the ANM (Automated Network Management)
system described in the article "ANM: Automated Network Management System"
by M. Feridun, M. Leib, M. Nodine and J. Ong, IEEE Network, March 1988 - Vol
2, No 2, pp. 13-19. In the ANM system, network entities such as gateways, provide
data to a backbone of Distributed Management Modules (DMMs) which service
'Clients' that provide the network management services. Clients request and
receive raw data collected from network entities by the DMM backbone; Clients can
also request the DMM backbone to execute specific actions. A specialised Client
called an Intelligent Network Manager is provided and comprises a collection of
expert systems (Experts) organised as a top-level Expert which forwards triggering 
data received from the network entities to

A system management method for carrying out a plurality of management
tasks (17) in relation to a plurality of services (15) intended to be provided by a

computer system made up of co-operating physical and logical entities, said method
comprising the steps of:


providing for each of said plurality of services, a respective declarative model
(22) specifying independently of any particular said task, the requirements

needing to be met for the service to be available, these requirements being set
out in terms of the entities required and their inter-relationships,
providing for each of said plurality of management tasks, respective task control
means (21) for controlling performance of the corresponding task in a manner

independent of any particular said model and in terms of general inferencing
operations that can be performed on any said model, and
performing a said management task in relation to a said service by a process
involving effecting inferencing operations (25) on the corresponding declarative

model under the control of the said task control means relevant to that
management task.
A system management method according to Claim 1, wherein each said task
control means comprises a respective task program (21) for controlling the operation

of an inference engine (25) used to perform said corresponding management task.
A system management method according to Claim 1, wherein each said task
control means is embodied, at least in part, in a respective inference engine used to

perform the corresponding task.
A system management method according to Claim 1, wherein said
computer system is capable of supporting a plurality of instantiations of a said

service, the said step of carrying out a said management task in relation to a said
service, involving identifying a said instantiation of the service for which the task is

to be carried out and then using the appropriate service model to inference
information in relation to the identified service instantiation.
A system management method according to Claim 1, wherein at least one
said declarative model (22) comprises a hierarchical structure of declarative

statements (52,53,54) inter-relating entities, statements lower in the hierarchy
serving to detail requirements specified by statements higher in said hierarchy. 
A system management method according to Claim 5, wherein said at least
one model includes, in addition to said statements specifying requirements,

statements generally inter-relating said entities and usable to infer whether a
particular said requirement has been met.
