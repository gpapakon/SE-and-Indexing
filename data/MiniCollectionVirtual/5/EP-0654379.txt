<ABSTRACT>
An exterior mirror assembly for a motor vehicle 
comprising a housing (11) containing a first mirror carrier 

(10, 50, 80) having a first substantially plane mirror (12, 
58, 82) mounted thereon and a second mirror carrier (16, 

52, 82) mounted adjacent to the first mirror carrier (10, 
50, 80) for angular movement about an axis (18, 56, 86) 

parallel to an adjacent edge of the first mirror (12, 58, 
82). The second mirror carrier (16, 52, 82) has a plane 

mirror (24, 66, 98) on a first face and a convex mirror 
(26, 68, 100) on a second face. When the second mirror 

carrier (16, 52, 82) in a first orientation, the mirror 
(24, 66, 82) on the first face forms a substantially 

continuous reflective surface with the mirror (12, 58, 88) 
on the first mirror carrier (10, 50, 80) of substantially 

uniform curvature. When the second mirror carrier (16, 52, 
82) is in a second orientation, the convex mirror (26, 68, 

100) on the second face forms a substantially continuous 
reflective surface with the mirror (12, 60, 90) on the 

first mirror carrier (10, 50, 80) of greater curvature in 
the region of the second mirror carrier (16, 52, 82) than 

in the region of the first mirror carrier (10, 50, 80).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rearview mirror 
assemblies for motor vehicles. One desirable feature of a vehicle rearview mirror 
assembly is to have as wide a field of view as can be 
arranged. For this purpose, it has been proposed to make 
the mirror of such a mirror assembly of convex shape. 
However, it has been found that the resulting reduction in 
the size of the perceived image viewed in such a mirror 
causes dangerous errors in a user's impression of the 
proximity of following vehicles viewed therein. 
Consequently, in many countries, regulations require a 
vehicle rearview mirror assembly either to be a plane 
mirror or to be a convex mirror of a relatively large 
radius of curvature, for example, greater than 1.8m 
(hereinafter referred to as a "substantially plane 
mirror"). The result of this is that, particularly in the 
case of a mirror assembly mounted on the driver's door of 
a motor vehicle, there is a so-called "blind spot" between 
the disappearance of an overtaking vehicle from the field 
of view of the mirror assembly and its appearance at the 
periphery of the driver's direct-vision field of view. 
This problem is enhanced when the overtaking and overtaken 
vehicles are on converging paths, for example when the 
overtaken vehicle is joining a motorway. It has already been proposed, for example, in US-A-4331382, 
to alleviate this problem by providing an 
exterior mirror assembly having a flat portion of 
sufficient dimensions to meet legal requirements, together 
an outer convex portion to cover the above mentioned "blind 
spot". This has the disadvantage of increasing the extent 
to which the mirror assembly projects from the side of the 
vehicle. It has also been proposed, in EP-A-0292223 to 
provide a mirror assembly having a mirror carrier mounted 
in a housing for angular movement through 180Â° about a 
central vertical axis. A plane (or only slightly convex) 
reflective mirror is mounted on one side of the mirror 
carrier, while a mirror having a convex outer edge is  
 
mounted on the other side. Angular movement of the mirror 
carrier to bring the latter reflective surface into the 
user's field of view provides an extended field of vision 
to cover the "blind spot". However, this mirror assembly 
suffers from the disadvantage that no view of following 
traffic is provided during the time when the mirror carrier 
is being moved from one orientation to the other. According to the invention, an exterior mirror 
assembly for a motor vehicle comprises a housing containing

An exterior mirror assembly for a motor vehicle 
comprising a housing (11) containing a first mirror carrier 

(10, 50, 80) having a first substantially plane mirror (12, 
58, 82) mounted thereon and a second mirror carrier (16, 

52, 82) mounted adjacent to the first mirror carrier (10, 
50, 80) for angular movement about an axis (18, 56, 86) 

parallel to an adjacent edge of the first mirror (12, 58, 
82), the second mirror carrier (16, 52, 82) having a 

substantially plane mirror (24, 66, 98) on a first face and 
a convex mirror (26, 68, 100) of greater curvature than the 

substantially plane mirror (24, 66, 98) on a second face so 
that, with the second mirror carrier (16, 52, 82) in a 

first orientation, the mirror (24, 66, 82) on the first 
face forms a substantially continuous reflective surface 

with the mirror (12, 58, 88) on the first mirror carrier 
(10, 50, 80) of substantially uniform curvature and, when 

the second mirror carrier (16, 52, 82) is in a second 
orientation, the convex mirror (26, 68, 100) on the second 

face forms a substantially continuous reflective surface 
with the mirror (12, 60, 90) on the first mirror carrier

second mirror carrier (16, 52, 82) than in the region of 

the first mirror carrier (10, 50, 80).

wherein the first mirror carrier (50, 80) is also pivotally 

mounted for angular movement about an axis (54, 84) 
parallel to that of the second mirror carrier (52, 82) and 

has a second mirror (60, 90) on another face of radius of 
curvature greater than that of the mirror on its first face 

(58, 88). 
An exterior mirror assembly according to claim 1 
or 2, wherein at least one of the mirror carriers (16) has 

a pivot unit comprising a static shaft (18) having a first 
segment (30) of greater radius than a second segment (32), 

the mirror carrier (16) having a cylindrical bore (34) of 
radius such as to be a sliding fit on the first segment  

 
(30), together with a radially inwardly extending 

projection (36) having an inner end positioned to be a 
sliding fit on the second segment (32). 
An exterior mirror assembly according to claim 1,

mirror carriers (80, 82) has resilient mounting means 
biasing it towards the other shaft but allowing the two 

shafts (84, 86) to move apart to a limited extent.
