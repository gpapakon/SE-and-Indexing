<ABSTRACT>
Method for remotely heating a polymeric material 
to a selected temperature in which particulate ferromagnetic 

material (3) having a Curie temperature corresponding 
to the selected heating temperature is dispersed throughout 

the polymeric material to form a composite, and microwave 
energy is applied to the resulting composite. Preferably, 

the particulate ferromagnetic material comprises only about 
2 percent of the total composite by weight. The polymeric 

material may be compliant, thermosettable plastic, and the 
Curie temperature of the particulate ferromagnetic material 

dispersed therein may advantageously be above the curing 
temperature of the polymer, such that a beam (13) of microwave 

energy may be used to remotely join surfaces or construct 
joints in composite structures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to methods for 
remotely heating polymeric materials to selected temperatures 
by the dispersion of particulate ferromagnetic 
materials throughout the polymers whose Curie temperatures 
correspond to the selected temperatures of heating and find 
particular application in the remote formation of joints in 
composite structures, as well as in forming plastic materials 
which are either recyclable, or separably heat degradable. 
One such remote heating method is disclosed in US-A-3 620 876. Thermosettable plastic materials for forming 
mechanical joints or other structures are known in the 
prior art. In their uncured state, such materials may 
resemble either viscous liquids, putty-like solids, or even 
flexible, tape-like materials which may be manipulated into 
a desired shape, and then heat-cured to form a tough 
plastic solid that assumes the shape that the uncured 
polymer was last manipulated into. These materials find 
particular application with respect to the construction of 
joints in composite structures, such as in the graphite 
composite frames of state-of-the-art aircraft. Unfortunately, there are a number of drawbacks 
associated with the use of such thermosettable polymers to 
construct aircraft frames and other structures that 
significantly limits their usefulness. For example, at 
some stages of construction, it is desirable if not 
absolutely necessary that the heat used to thermoset the  
 
polymer be applied only locally to the specific area of the 
joint, as the application of such heat to the surrounding 
components may damage or degrade them. In such instances, 
the application of heat in the form of infrared radiation 
must be performed very carefully, and with appropriate 
shielding so as not to damage the surrounding components. 
Still other difficulties arise with respect to the 
inspection of the surrounding joints. As joints formed 
entirely of plastics and other composite materials are 
transparent to X-rays, it is not possible to inspect the 
joint for bubbles, cracks, or other quality-degrading 
discontinuities with the same kind of X-ray equipment used 
to inspect metallic joints. Finally, both of these 
aforementioned problems become exacerbated when it is 
necessary to perform the repair of a joint formed from such 
thermosettable, polymeric materials since the remote and 
focused application of the energy necessary to heat-cure 
the thermosetting plastic used in the repair becomes 
difficult, if not impossible, as does the ability to
