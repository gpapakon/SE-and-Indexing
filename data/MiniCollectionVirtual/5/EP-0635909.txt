<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) is disclosed for 
interconnecting a flat flexible circuit to a printed 

circuit board. The connector includes a dielectric housing 
(12) having an elongated mouth (14) for receiving the flat 

flexible circuit. Terminals (18) are mounted in the 
housing and are adapted for coupling appropriate conductors 

of the flat flexible circuit with circuit traces on the 
printed circuit board. An actuator (20) has an elongated 

tongue (22) for insertion into the mouth of the housing to 
maintain the flat flexible circuit in engagement with the 

terminals. At least one latch/mounting clip (24, 24', 44, 
44', 50, 50', 60, 60') is mounted on the housing, and a 

complementary interengaging latch (36, 38) is provided 
between a first portion (26) of the clip and the actuator 

to hold the actuator in its inserted position on the housing. 
A second portion (28, 40, 40', 46, 46', 52, 52', 62, 

62') of the clip is adapted for operative association with 
the printed circuit board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical connector for 
interconnecting a flat flexible circuit component to a 
printed circuit board according to the preamble of claim 1. Various electrical connectors of the type referred to 
above have been provided to effect zero insertion force on 
either flat flexible cable or flexible printed circuitry 
(hereinafter generically referred to as a flat flexible 
circuit), and interconnecting the flat flexible circuit to a 
printed circuit board. Connectors of this type (EP-A-0 
540 260) typically utilize a dielectric housing, such as 
of molded plastic material, having terminals mounted therein 
and a movable actuator insertable into the housing for 
pressing the flat flexible circuit against the terminals. 
The dielectric housing and the actuator have complementary 
interengaging latch means for holding the actuator in an 
inserted position. The terminals have ends which are 
arranged so as to fit into through holes of the printed 
circuit board. This means that no surface mounting is 
intended. A similar connector, yet for surface mounting to the 
circuit board, is shown in US-A-4,900,268. Here, terminal 
projections of the connectors are to be soldered to the 
terminal pads of the circuit board and must meet each other. In such cases, separate mounting, polarizing or other 
components often are mounted on the housing for registration 
purposes, such as a separate metal retainer or "fitting 
nail". A fitting nail generally has a flat or planar portion 
for soldering to a dummy solder pad on the board to secure 
the connector to the board. Separate mounting pegs also may 
be added to the housing, as well as separate polarizing 
posts. One of the problems with all of these separate 
components is that they add considerably to the cost of the  
 
connectors. The mounting pegs and/or polarizing posts may be formed 
integral with the housing, similar to the latch means for 
the actuator. However, such components are extremely small 
and fragile, especially when molded with high temperature 
plastics. An object, therefore, of the invention is to provide an 
electrical connector for interconnecting a flat flexible 
circuit to a printed circuit board. The invention is defined in claim 1. With the invention a unique latch/mounting clip on the 
connector housing is provided and performs a dual function 
of latching the actuator to the housing as well as providing 
the flexibility of a mounting and/or polarizing means for 
securing the housing to the printed circuit board. In
