<ABSTRACT>
Electrical control panels responsive to finger touch of marked areas on a front plate are used increasingly, such a touch establishing a coupling to electrode areas or other sensor means at the rear side of the plate. According to the invention the rear side of the front plate is used directly as a mounting base for the associated electronic components, whereby an integrated unit with a high operational safety is achievable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a touch sensitive 
control panel of the kind comprising a front plate 
preferably in a dielectric material such as glass, and 
electrodes disposed on its reverse side together with 
with electronic circuits where the front plate carries 
markings that indicate touch areas, whereby a touch by a 
finger gives such an operative coupling to the respective 
electrodes disposed on the reverse side that the 
panel unit may give off selective control signals by 
means of the electronic circuits. Such panel units, as known for instance from DE-A-27 28 188, or 
elements are increasingly used as control panels in 
various kinds of electrical and electronic equipment 
because they may advantageously replace panels with 
mounted mechanically acting switches or rotary or pushbutton 
activated elements in that a light touch upon a 
selected area may effect the desired function, such as a 
start or stop function or an ascending or descending 
control function without any use of mechanical action. 
These units function by capacitive coupling. In particular because this kind of control panel 
are known per se the general advantages of using them 
will not be discussed in detail here. It may be more 
relevant to note that the control panels according to 
the novel technology are predominantly manufactured in 
specialist establishments because it is no longer a 
simple mounting of ready-made special switches and 
controllers but the manufacture of a new type of product 
which comprises both the panel plate and at least the 
most necessary electronic circuitry. It has, however, been possible to prepare a kind 
of intermediate stage where the manufacture of the panel 
plate itself has been a specialist task whereas the 
electronic circuitry might be put on a conventional 
printed circuit board which could be prepared with 
suitable contact means for establishing contact with  
 
specific electrode areas on the reverse of the front 
plate. These defined areas are typically made as a 
coating of graphite powder which by a suitable technique 
has been fixed reliably to the reverse of the front 
plate so that the electrode areas thus created have a 
suitable extent with a well-defined position and are 
easily accessible for establishing contact with projecting 
contact elements on the printed circuit board 
disposed behind it, as these elements only need to abut 
the said coatings in a fairly uncritical fashion somewhere 
on their extent. It has, however, been shown in practice that there 
may
