<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of increasing the yield of recovered 
solutions having an increased concentration of b isoform of an 

enzymatically-active polypeptide analog of Cu-Zn superoxide 
dismutase from a composition which comprises cells containing a, 

b and c isoforms of the polypeptide analog comprising treating 
the composition to separate soluble proteins from whole cells, 

cellular debris and insoluble proteins to obtain a solution 
containing such soluble proteins, including the a, b and c 

isoforms; treating the resulting solution with soluble proteins 
to produce three separate solutions, each of which has an 

increased concentration of one of either of the a, b or c 
isoform; recovering the separate solution with an increased 

concentration of the b isoform; combining the separate solution 
with an increased concentration of the a isoform with the 

separate solution with an increased concentration of the c 
isoform; treating the resulting combined solution to produce a 

solution with an increased concentration of the b isoform and 
recovering the then-resulting solution with an increased 

concentration of the b isoform.

<DESCRIPTION>
Throughout this application, various publications are 
referenced by Arabic numerals within parentheses. Full 
citations for these references may be found at the end 
of the specification immediately preceding the claims. 
The disclosures of these publications in their 
entireties are hereby incorporated by reference in this 
application in order to more fully describe the state 
of the art to which this invention pertains. This invention provides an improved method for 
purification of recombinant copper/zinc (Cu-Zn) 
superoxide dismutase from bacteria or eucaryotic cells. The clinical potential of the enzyme superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) is enormous. The scientific literature 
suggests that SOD could be useful in a wide range of 
clinical applications. Those include prevention of 
oncogenesis and tumor growth and reduction of cytotoxic 
and cardiotoxic effects of anticancer drugs, anti-inflammatory 
protection of ischemic tissues and protection 
of spermatozoa. In addition, there is great interest 
in studying the effect of SOD on the aging process. 
There is also evidence that SOD can be used to 
prevent the damage sometimes caused to newborn babies 
by hyperbaric oxygen treatment.  In particular, there is increasing evidence that "reperfusion 
injury" caused by oxygen free radicals (probably 
generated from xanthine oxidase) accounts for much 
of the damage caused by a period of ischemia in many 
organs of the body such as the spinal cord, intestine, 
skin, heart, lung, pancreas or kidney (11). In vitro and animal experiments using human recombinant 
copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (hCu-Zn SOD analog), 
produced as described in coassigned U.S. Patent No. 
4,742,004, issued May 2, 1988, and in corresponding 
European patent application publication no. 0173280, 
published May 5, 1986, have demonstrated the efficacy 
of SOD in reducing reperfusion injury e.g., in the 
spinal cord of dogs (12), in the hearts of rabbits 
(13), and in the hearts of dogs (14). The superoxide anion (0·₂) produced on reperfusion of 
ischemic tissue and also in certain inflammatory conditions 
is highly toxic to macromolecules, e.g., O·₂ may 
react with lipid hydroperoxides to form alkoxy radicals 
in phospholipid membranes. The superoxide anion (O·₂) is removed in normal biologic 
tissue by the dismutation reaction:

2O·₂ + 2H⁺ → H₂O₂ + O₂


 
The above reaction can proceed spontaneously or it can 
be catalyzed by SOD which increases the rate of intercellular 
dismutation by a factor of 10⁹. SOD is a 
ubiquitous mammalian
