<ABSTRACT>
A welding method for a disposable diaper comprising 
steps of putting wing-like portions (21,22) provided on front 

and rear bodies (5,6) including a topsheet (2), a backsheet (3) and 
a core (4) sandwiched therebetween, one upon another, with said 

topsheet opposed face to face; placing cover sheet (20) 
having a melting point higher than a melting point of said 

backsheet on an outer surface of said wing-like portions 
and welding, under heat and pressure exerted from 

above said covering sheet, laterally opposite side edges of 
said wing-like portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of welding a
disposable diaper along laterally opposite side edges at its
waist level.One example of a pant type of disposable diapers is
disclosed in Japanese patent application Disclosure JP-A-50-15551 &
EP-A-0 531 666 according to which a diaper comprising top- and
backsheets and a liquid-absorbent core sandwiched
therebetween is folded up along a transverse center line
passing through a crotch zone to lay front and rear bodies one
upon another and the top- and backsheets are ultrasonic-welded
together along laterally opposite side edges at its
waist level to obtain a pant type of a configuration. The top-and
backsheets may be formed, for example, by nonwoven fabric
of thermoplastic synthetic resin adapted to be molten by an
ultrasonic treatment.Nonwoven fabric employed in the technique disclosed in
said Disclosure as material for the top- and backsheets may
be composed from fibres of the same type as mentioned above
and molten until the nonwoven fabric exhibits an appropriate
viscosity so that a weld zone of the top- and backsheets may 
present a smoothly finished appearance. However, if the
topsheet formed by nonwoven fabric of polypropylene fibre
having a relative high melting point is combined with the
backsheet formed by polyethylene sheet or film having a
relatively low melting point, the polyethylene sheet will be
molten earlier than the polypropylene fibre when the diaper
is folded up to form a pant type and subjected to the
ultrasonic treatment. In consequence, the polyethylene sheet
may be molten to an excessively low viscosity and stick to a
horn for the ultrasonic treatment which has been pressed
against this sheet. The polyethylene sheet which has sticked
to the horn will present, after cooled, a rough surface
giving the wearer' skin an itchy stimulus as well as an
uncomfortable feel and spoils an aesthetical appearance of
the diaper. If the polyethylene sheet remains sticking to
the horn, no accurate clearance can be assured between the
horn and an anvil for the ultrasonic treatment during the
next cycle of the treatment, thus making the continuous
treatment difficult.Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention
to solve the problem accompanying said prior art by placing
a covering sheet having a melting point higher than a melting
point of a backsheet upon an outer surface of the backsheet 
and bringing it in contact with pressing means such as a horn
for an ultrasonic treatment.The object set forth above is achieved, according to

<CLAIMS>
A welding method for a disposable
diaper generally comprising steps of assembling a

liquid-permeable topsheet (2), a
liquid-impermeable backsheet (3) and a

liquid-absorbent core (4) sandwiched between these
sheets into a configuration of disposable diaper

(1), putting wing-like portions (21, 22) of front
and rear bodies (5, 6) outwardly extending from

laterally opposite side edges of said core one
upon another and welding said wing-like portions

(21, 22) put one upon another under heat and
pressure together to form opposite side portions

at waist levels of said front and rear bodies,
said welding method further comprising steps of:


assembling topsheet members associated with
said topsheet (2) so as to form extensions

thereof with said backsheet (3) made of
material having a melting point lower than a

melting point of said topside sheet members to 
form said wing-like portions (21, 22), putting

said wing-like portions (21, 22) one upon
another with said topsheet members opposited

face to face inside said diaper, placing
covering sheets (20) having a melting point

higher than the melting point of said backsheet
(3) but covering only partially the area of the

backsheet (3) on an outer surface of said
backsheet (3), and welding said wing-like

portions (21, 22) along laterally opposite side
edges thereof together with said covering

sheets (20).
A welding method for a disposable
diaper according to claim 1, wherein sai
d topsheet
member is part of said topsheet (2) extending

outward from a lateral side edge of said core.
A welding method for disposable
diaper according to claim 1, wherein said topsheet

member is a separated sheet (25, 37) bonded onto
said backsheet (3) of said wing-like portion (21,

22).
