<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of the nitriding process is to impart to articles made of ferrous metal, besides the surface properties resulting directly from the nitriding, a corrosion resistance comparable to that which is obtained by following the nitriding treatment with an oxidation treatment, especially in salt baths. According to the process of the invention the articles are treated by immersion for an appropriate period in a molten salt bath consisting in a manner known per se essentially of alkali metal cyanates and carbonates and containing a small quantity of a sulphur-containing species, the articles are raised, in relation to a counterelectrode immersed in the bath, to a positive potential such that a substantial current passes through the bath from the articles to the counterelectrode, and the content of cyanides formed in a secondary reaction is maintained at a value lower than 6 %. It is preferable to work at a constant average current; typical current densities are from 300 to 800 amperes per m

, the typical range of temperatures 450-650 DEG C, and the typical times range between 10 and 150 min.

Method of nitriding ferrous metal parts, giving them 
improved corrosion resistance, in which the part
s are treated 
by immersion for a period of 10 to 150 minutes in a bath of 

molten salts essentially consisting of alkali metal carbonates 
and cyanates and containing at least one sulphur-containing 

substance in a quantity such that the S
2-
 ion content of the 
bath is between 1 and 6 ppm, characterised in that during 

their immersion in the bath the parts are raised, with respect 
to a counter-electrode immersed in the bath, to a positive 

electrical potential such that a current passes through the 
bath from the parts to the counter-electrode, the current 

density at the parts being between 300 and 800 amperes per 
square metre (A/m
2
), and the concentration of cyanides formed 
by secondary reaction is maintained below 6%. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
bath is contained in a metal crucible forming the counter-electrode. 
Method according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in that 
the current passing through the bath is kept substantially 

constant during the immersion of the parts in the bath. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
current density at the parts is between 450 and 550 A/m
2
. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the temperature of the salt bath is 

between 450째 and 650째C and preferably between 550째 and 600째C.

characterised in that the treatment time ranges from 30 to 100 

minutes.

cations, and in that the CN
-
 anion content of the bath is less 
than 2%. 
Method according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
bath is maintained substantially at its original composition 

by the addition in a known manner of regenerating and 
stabilising agents. 
Method according to Claim 8, characterised in that the 
cyanide content of the bath is kept at 2% at most. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the bath is homogenised by blowing in 

air.
