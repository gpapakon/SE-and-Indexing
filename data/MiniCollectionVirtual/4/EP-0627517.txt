<ABSTRACT>
Method for obtaining double-faced knitwear, which involves producing run-proof knitwear on a warp-knitting machine having three or four bars with heald hooks, dyeing the knitwear produced in the piece and then drawing and teasing the right side so as to cause fibres to appear, and finally carrying out postforming on a stenter. It is characterised in that:   - the ground knit is produced by operating the central bar (bar 2) and the rear bar (bar 3) of the machine according to a weave making it possible to obtain a knitted structure blocked in length and extendible in width, the feed of the bars with heald hooks being carried out according to a one-full/one-empty sequence; - the surface effects are obtained by operating the front bar (bar 1) according to a weave forming wefts which, after the drawing of the knitwear in length, form floats, the said bar being fed one full/one empty, and the stitching being carried out on the needles intermediate to those forming the ground knit, this taking place over every two rows of the knitwear, the intermediate row not stitching.
