<ABSTRACT>
A mobile communication system which performs
a handover operation with high-reliability, while the

system can flexibly cope with various circumstances in
which a mobile station (11) is used, without changing

a hardware structure. A plurality of radio base
stations (12-1 to 12-N) form respective radio

communication cells. Each of the radio base stations
performs a radio channel setting control including a

handover with respect to a call originated for the
mobile station (11) located in one of the cells. An

exchange (13) is connected to each of the radio base
stations via a communication link so that the exchange

(13) performs a call process of the call in
association with the radio channel setting control

performed by the radio base stations (12-1 to 12-N).
After the call becomes a completed call and prior to a

handover operation, a movement of the mobile station
(11) from one of the cells in which the mobile station

is located to another one of the cells adjacent to the
one of the cells is predicted based on at least one of

procedures of the radio channel setting control and
the call process. When the movement is predicted so

as to select candidate cells which are candidates of a
transferee of the completed call, a free radio channel

of the cells is acquired. A path connected to the
acquired free radio channel is formed in the

communication link.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. The present invention relates to a
mobile communication system and, more particularly, to
a mobile communication system in which a handover of a
mobile station is performed when a completed call is
originated while the mobile station is moving.2. Description of the Related Art
In recent years, terminals of mobile
communication system are rapidly spreading due to
liberalization of the market and application of high-level
digital transmission techniques. Such terminals
are further spread in response to development and
widespread use of a system such as a personal handy
phone system (PHS) which offers a low-cost mobile
communication service. The development is directed to
an application for satisfying versatile needs.
Accordingly, when such a terminal is used in a high-speed
traffic system and when a completed call
originates while a mobile station is moving, the
number of times of handover of the call is increased
as speed of movement of the mobile station increases.In a conventional mobile communication
system, when the completed call is originated while a
mobile station is moving, a mobile station
(hereinafter referred to as a transferor cell) in
which the completed call is currently originating and
a radio base station (hereinafter referred to as a
transferor base station) form a cell (radio zone) in
which the mobile station is located. The mobile
station and the base station cooperate with each other
so as to measure transmission quality of the radio
transmission paths for adjacent cells or peripheral
cells (hereinafter referred to as the adjacent cells 
as a whole) which are candidates for the mobile
station to be moved. The measurement based on an
electric field intensity in addition to measurements
of transmission quality in the transferor cell. The
transferor base station compares the measured
transmission qualities, and performs a radio channel
setting control operation necessary for resuming the
current communication when the transmission quality of
the transferor cell is higher than that of the
adjacent cells. However, on the contrary, if the
transmission quality of the adjacent cells is higher
than that of the transferor cell, the transferor base
station determines the candidate of the adjacent cell
(hereinafter referred to as an adjacent cell) to which
the mobile station will be moved by a handover based
on a descending order of transmission quality.
Additionally, the transferor base station sends a
notification that the radio base station forming the
adjacent cell (hereinafter referred to
