<ABSTRACT>
A little finger bag 16, a medical finger bag 18 and a 
middle finger bag 20 of a golf glove 10 are connected to a bag 

base 12. The golf glove 10 has a forefinger exposing hole 22 
and a thumb exposing hole 24. The interiors of the little 

finger bag 16, medical finger bag 18 and middle finger bag 20 
communicate with the interior of the bag base 12. The hand 

base including the palm and back of the hand, the little 
finger, medical finger and middle finger are fitted in the bag 

base 12, little finger bag 16, medical finger bag 18 and 
middle finger bag 20, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a golf glove which is 
worn on a less skillful hand to prevent the slip of the hand 
when the golfer gripping a golf club swings it. Golf gloves worn on less skillful hands to prevent the 
slip of the hand when the golfer gripping a club swings it are 
available on the market and widely used. Further, golf gloves 
designed to be more effective in preventing slip are also 
proposed as found In Japanese Utility Model Applications Kokai 
Hei 4 - 25781; Kokai Hei 4 - 58280; and Kokai Hei 4 - 111377. These conventional golf gloves each have finger bags for 
the five fingers. The basic method for correct gripping for 
correct swing is to firmly grip the grip of a golf club by the 
little finger, medical finger and middle finger with the 
forefinger and thumb lightly placed on the grip. However, if 
the golfer wearing the conventional golf glove having fiver 
finger bags swings, the forefinger and thumb tend to easily 
exert force; therefore, it has been very difficult to practice 
said basic method. Further, if the basic method for correct 
gripping is practiced, the forefinger and thumb are lightly 
placed on the grip and even if it is not practiced, the  
 
forefinger and thumb do not assume the state in which they 
firmly grip the club grip. For this reason, some amount of 
friction is produced between the finger bags for the 
forefinger and thumb and the club grip during swing, and 
repeated swing results in torsion in these finger bags (in the 
case where the glove is formed by sewing leather, the sewing 
lines are twisted), until they are torn extremely earlier than 
the other finger bags. Then, the tearing of only the finger 
bags for the forefinger and thumb, which have nothing to do 
with prevention of slip on the club grip, makes it necessary 
to replace the whole of the golf glove, a fact which is very 
uneconomical. Concerning this point, Japanese Utility Model Kokai Hei 59 
- 55572 discloses a golf glove wherein those portions of the 
finger bags for the forefinger and thumb which rub against 
the club grip are reinforced as by patches to heighten the 
slip preventing effect and at the same time to prolong the 
life of the golf glove against the tearing due to friction 
with the club grip. However, if such golf glove in which the 
portions which rub against the club grip are reinforced is 
worn on the hand, the forefinger and thumb tend to exert 
force more easily, adversely affecting the swing; furthermore, 
such reinforcement increases the amount of material and

<CLAIMS>
A golf glove comprising: 
a bag base adapted to be fitted through an insertion opening 

on the hand base including the palm and back of the hand, 
a little finger bag, a medical finger bag and a middle finger 

bag connected to said bag base for communication with the 
interior of the latter, 

a forefinger exposing hole and a thumb exposing hole through 
which the forefinger and thumb extend from inside the bag base 

for exposure. 
A golf glove as set forth in Claim 1, wherein the 
forefinger exposing hole and thumb exposing hole are 

respectively adapted to allow the forefinger and thumb 
substantially in their entirety to extend therethrough from 

inside the bag base for exposure. 
A golf glove characterised in that the glove (10) only 
has finger coverings (16,18,20) for the little finger, the 

annular or ring finger (medical finger) and the middle finger, 
and has two apertures through which the forefinger (index 

finger) and the thumb may extend without covering. 
A glove as claimed in claim 3, wherein the trank 
part or portions (bag base) (12) only has fourchettes (16,18,20) 

as parts or portions extending therefrom for the little 
finger, the medical/ring finger and the middle finger. 
A glove as claimed in claims 3 or 4, wherein it is a 
left-hand glove or a right-hand glove.
