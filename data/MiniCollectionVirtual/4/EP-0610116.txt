<ABSTRACT>
The device for making totally separated or partially joined (21) successive lengths (22, 23) in a continuous web (23) by cutting includes a pivoting blade (12) having a cutting edge (6) and a stationary blade (16) also having a cutting edge (1), the edge of the pivoting blade crossing the edge of the stationary blade, during pivoting, at a point (M) which can move along the stationary edge (1) over a distance at least equal to the width of the web (24). The pivoting blade has an end part (15) which is angularly offset to the rear with respect to the active rotation direction (A) of the blade (12) and connected to the other part (6) by an edge portion (19) crossing the stationary edge (1) at a point which is substantially stationary on this stationary edge during the pivoting of the pivoting blade.
