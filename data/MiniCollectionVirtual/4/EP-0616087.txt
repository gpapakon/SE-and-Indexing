<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a municipal cleaning vehicle for flushing and cleaning sewers and vessels or the like, comprising a tank (10) having a sludge compartment (11) and a service-water compartment (12), it being possible to connect said service-water compartment (12) to a flushing hose (14) through which, by means of a pump device (15) which is upstream of a pressure-regulating valve (17), water (19) is delivered to that end of the flushing hose (14) which may be provided with a nozzle head (16). The pressure of the water (19) between pump device (15) and the pressure-regulating valve (17) is registered, an assembly (18) which drives the pump device (15) having its drive efficiency reduced in the event of an increase in pressure beyond a presettable pressure of the water (19).

Municipal vehicle for flushing and cleaning drains and tanks or similar 
objects, comprising a tank (10) with a sludge compartment (11) and a service water 

compartment (12), the latter being connected to a flushing hose (14), together with a 
pumping device (15) which pumps water (19) to the end of the flushing hose (14) 

which can be equipped with a nozzle head (16), characterized by a pressure-sensitive 
switch (20) connected via a pressure transducer line (21) to a line (13) between the 

pumping device (15) and its downstream pressure regulating valve (17), this switch 
being used to detect the pressure of the water (19) between the pumping device (15) 

and pressure regulating valve (17) and, should this pressure rise above a preadjustable 
level, to trigger an actuator (22) which reduces the power of the unit (18) driving the 

pumping device (15). 
Municipal vehicle according to claim 1, characterized in that the driving 
power is reduced by lowering the speed of the power unit (18). 
Municipal vehicle according to one or both of claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the actuator (22) consists of an electric motor controlled by the switch (20). 
Municipal vehicle according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the pressure regulating valve (17) has an overflow outlet (23) which is connected 

to the service water compartment (12) of the tank (10).
