<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a reflector (1) for an electrical radiation fitting (31) as well as a radiation fitting provided with one or several such reflectors. A reflector comprises top sections (3, 4) and with respect to the longitudinal extension of the fitting longitudinal sections (5, 6). The interior side of the reflector is provided with a reflecting layer (2). According to the invention, to the top section (3, 4) and the longitudinal sections (5, 6) there are connected at an angle of app. 45 DEG  oblique diagonal sections (7-10) for controlling the light from a fluorescent tube (13) mainly in diagonal and longitudinal direction of the fitting. Between a pair of diagonal sections (7, 10) respectively (8, 9) there extends in transverse direction of the fitting transverse sections (11, 12), above which there are triangle-shaped openings for introduction of a fluorescent tube (13). The radiation fitting (31) is provided with a larger number of reflectors arranged in series, the lateral outer sides of which are situated within vertical planes for flush abutment against each other, the free edges of the sections being provided to rest upon a border (32) surrounding the fitting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a reflector for an electrical
radiation fitting and an electrical radiation fitting furnished
with such a reflector.The spread of light in longitudinal direction of the normally
elongated conventional fluorescent tube fittings has so far been
very unsatisfactory both concerning uniformity and primarily
controllability. This has resulted in that the location of the
light fittings has been directly crucial for the spread of light.
The manufacturer has not to any significant effect been able to
take into account needs and requests of the user in these respects.
The result has been, that a certain surplus capacity and/or anti-dazzle-screens
had to be used for accomplishing greater spread and
uniformity. This is, of course, a disadvantage with respect to both
illumination ergonomics and energy used. Previous attempts to
satisfy various demands and requests have often entailed use of
light fittings of different dimensions and/or shaped in different
ways.Furthermore, the previously known reflectors are relatively weak
and/or material demanding. Also, it is often necessary to furnish
the reflectors with special fasteners for keeping them in place in
a light fitting.By US-A-2 242 590, there is previously known a generally
quadratic light reflector showing a top section, diagonal
sections and sections interconnecting the diagonal sections.
All the sections are flat or planar and are substantially
uniformly shaped and arranged in mainly uniform spreading
of light in all directions.An objective of the invention is to improve and develop known
techniques in this field primarily in the above mentioned respects.
More precisely, the invention is to make possible a considerable,
flexible light control even in longitudinal direction of an
electric radiation fitting. It should even be possible, with use of
a certain given fitting shell, by arranging differently shaped
reflectors in said shell, to accomplish different light spread
patterns, primarily in longitudinal direction of the fitting with
maintained light spread in transverse direction of the fitting.These objectives are accomplished according to the invention by a  
reflector of the initially defined kind, which reflector mainly is
shaped as stated in the characterizing clause of claim 1. Said
objectives are accomplished even in that an electric radiation
fitting mainly is designed as stated in the first claim concerning
such a fitting.Further characteristics of and advantages with the invention are
revealed by the following
