<ABSTRACT>
A shaving apparatus has at least one shaving unit (2) which comprises an 
external shaving member (
3
) and an internal shaving member (
4
) which is rotatably 
drivable relative to the external shaving member, the external shaving member having 

an annular wall portion (5) with lamellae (6) which extend in substantially radial 
directions and between which hair-entry apertures (7) are formed, the internal shaving 

member comprising cutters (9). In order to improve the shaving performance the 
shaving apparatus is characterized in that the average circumferential velocity of the 

cutter is between 0.4 and 1.2 m/s.

<DESCRIPTION>
A shaving apparatus having at least one shaving unit comprising an 
external shaving member and an internal shaving member which is rotatably drivable 
relative to the external shaving member, the external shaving member having an annular 
wall portion with hair-entry apertures, and the internal shaving member having cutters 
comprising cutting edges which describe a path adjoining the inner side of the annular 
wall portion of the external shaving member. A rotary shaving apparatus of the type defined in the opening paragraph is 
disclosed in, for example, US-A-4,675,998 (PHN 11161). In such shaving apparatuses the shaving performance could be improved, 
i.e. the hairs could be severed closer to the skin, by reducing the thickness of the wall 
portion in which hair-entry apertures are situated. However, this would be at the 
expense of the so-called skin comfort. This is because the skin would then protrude 
slightly further into the path of internal shaving member, as a result of which the skin 
could be injured and/or a slightly irritating effect could arise. It is an object of the invention to improve the shaving performance of the 
shaving apparatus of the type defined in the opening paragraph, in such a way that the 
skin comfort remains satisfactory or is even improved. To this end the shaving apparatus in accordance with the invention is 
characterized in that the average circumferential velocity of the cutter is between 0.4 
and 1.2 m/s. The invention is based on the recognition of the fact that the mass inertia 
of the skin portion which deformed during the shaving process can play an important 
part in the skin comfort of the shaving apparatus. Pursuant to this it has been 
established by experiment that a lower speed of the internal shaving member is far more  
 
comfortable to the skin. This enables the thickness of the wall portion with the hair-entry 
apertures to be reduced while the skin comfort is maintained or even improved in 
comparison with the rotary shavers known until now. A thinner wall portion results in 
the hairs being severed closer to the skin and hence in a better shaving performance. Cutting hairs requires energy, which is delivered by the motor. Sometimes 
hairs are severed simultaneously or immediately after each other. During cutting the 
rotating internal shaving member is subjected to forces which inter alia tend to urge the 
shaving member out of its path and also tend to slow down the shaving member. 
Cutting a hair is expedited when the internal shaving member is
