<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an apparatus and process for providing 
crosslinked fibers or tows with non-symmetrical crimps. The 

process requires preheating precursor fibers or tows so as to 
soften the fibers prior to passing the fibers or tows through a 

horizontal stuffer crimper box to impart a crimp. The crimped 
fiber is then passed through a heating zone without stress or 

tension whereby the fibers or tows are carbonized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and process for
providing crosslinked fibers with non-symmetrical crimps. More
particularly, there is provided an apparatus and process for
crimping crosslinked fibers of tows of fibers which act as if they
were crosslinked wherein the crimps are set by further heat
treatment.Crimp can be defined as the non-linearity in fiber. For most
of the man-made fibers employed in carpet manufacture, a non-woven
battings, the crimp or bend in the fiber is induced by
thermal/mechanical techniques. It can also be thought of as the
difference between the non-linear (crimped) fiber and the
straightened fiber (fiber extended). A crimp is important in
carpet fibers and non-woven applications because it provides bulk
to the yarn by preventing two fibers from laying parallel to one
another. As a result, the carpet tuft will have greater covering
power, appear softer, and give better resistance to wear and
abrasion, among other benefits.Crimp is also useful in the processing of staple fibers.
Crimp is particularly useful in the processing of high modulus
fibers which are difficult to work with because of slipperiness.It is standard practice to crimp staple fibers such as
polyester, acrylic, and nylon with steam and a stuffing box to 
provide pressure to result in a fiber which has waves or kinks in
it. This crimp makes the fiber process better in nonwoven textile
processes such as carding and permits the staple fiber to form high
loft (low density) battings. This crimp is necessary for efficient
processing of these fibers to spun yarns since the crimp is again
necessary for efficient carding necessary for many forms of yarn
making. The crimp also provides a means of further entangling the
fibers and making a stronger yarn. From an overall textile point
of view, crimp is important. However, textile fibers are
thermoplastic and therefore the crimp comes out if the fibers are
heated above their glass transition point. For instance, crimped
continuous tow PAN fiber(acrylic) when heated to 225°C while
undergoing preoxidation for the manufacture of OPF (oxidized
polyacrylonitrile fiber) totally loses its crimp while being pulled
through the oven.Thermoset fibers such as carbon fibers and related fibers
although relatively uncommon do not crimp since they do not soften
or melt. Heat, steam, and pressure do not create crimp in carbon
fiber, carbonaceous fibers (>65% carbon) or any other thermoset
fiber.Crimp in the stuffer box is achieved by passing yarn(s) or
tow(s) into a uniformly
