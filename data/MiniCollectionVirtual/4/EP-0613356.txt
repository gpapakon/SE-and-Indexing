<ABSTRACT>
A self contained urinary catheter assembly (10) for use in draining the bladder through the urethra comprising a flexible receptacle (11) defining a closed chamber (20) therein; a mounting (40) on the receptacle with a catheter opening (46) therethrough to the closed chamber; and a catheter (21) carried in the closed chamber in the flexible receptacle to be selectively extended out of the chamber through the catheter opening during use and retracted after use. The catheter may be selectively released from the chamber and opening so that uncontaminated urine samples may be removed from the closed chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SELF CONTAINED URINARY CATHETER ASSEMBLYI. TECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates generally to catheters and more particularly to intermittent catheter assemblies incorporated in a dual purpose sterile receptacle.II. BACKGROUND ARTSelf contained urinary catheter assemblies are currently available. These self contained catheters are available with the catheter itself stowed in a flexible bag to remain in a sterile field. An introducer is mounted on the bag to permit the catheter to be extended from the bag during use and retracted into the bag again after use. While the catheter is not extended, the introducer is covered by a sealing cover. Since the discharge end of the catheter always remains in the bag, the bag is sized to serve as a urine receptacle when the catheter is inserted through the urethra and into the bladder. These catheter assemblies typically are intermittently used only when the bladder needs to be drained and are removed after each use for disposal. The catheter/introducer assembly is the subject of Patent No. 4,652,259, dated March 24, 1987, issued to Alexander G. B. O'Neil.One of the problems with these prior art self contained catheter assemblies is that it is difficult to obtain an uncontaminated sample from the bag for testing as is frequently required in the environment in which the assembly is used. Another problem is that it is sometimes difficult to grip the catheter through the bag and the introducer to manipulate the catheter as it is being inserted in or removed from the urethra. III. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTIONThese and other problems and disadvantages associated with the prior art are overcome by the invention disclosed herein by providing a self contained urinary catheter assembly which provides a simple method of obtaining an 

 uncontaminated urine sample for testing. The invention further provides means for gripping the catheter through the receptacle so that manipulation of the catheter with respect to the receptacle during use is facilitated. The apparatus of the invention includes a flexible receptacle defining a closed chamber with a catheter carried in the closed chamber and mounting means on the flexible receptacle defining a catheter opening therethrough into said closed chamber through which said projecting end of the catheter can extend for insertion into the bladder through the urethra. The catheter has arresting means on one end thereof to prevent inadvertent removal of the catheter from the receptacle but which is constructed to release the catheter from the

CLAIMS 1. In an improved self contained urinary catheter assembly for use in draining the bladder through the urethra comprising: a) a flexible receptacle defining a closed chamber therein; b) a catheter carried in said closed chamber in said flexible receptacle and including: bl) an elongate catheter tube defining a projecting end and a drainage end at opposite ends thereof and defining a drainage passage extending from said projecting end to said drainage end so that fluids in the bladder can drain therethrough when said projecting end of said catheter tube is inserted into the bladder through the urethra, and b2) arresting means at said drainage end of said catheter tube; the improvement CHARACTERIZED BY, said catheter further including: release means for selectively releasing said arresting means from said catheter tube; and said self contained urinary catheter assembly further including: mounting means mounted on said flexible receptacle and defining a catheter opening therethrough into said closed chamber through which said projecting end of said catheter tube can extend for insertion into the bladder through the urethra, said catheter opening configurated so as to prevent said drainage end of said catheter tube from passing therethrough until said release means releases said arresting means from said catheter tube. 



 2. The self contained urinary catheter assembly of Claim 1 further CHARACTERIZED BY said release means including a weakened section in said catheter tube adjacent said arresting means that breaks when that portion of said catheter tube projecting out of said mountings is pulled with a force greater than any force to which said catheter tube is subjected during normal urinary drainage use so that said catheter tube can be pulled out of said receptacle leaving said catheter opening open to pour a non contaminated sample therethrough while said arresting means remains in said closed chamber in said receptacle.
3. The self contained urinary catheter assembly of Claim 2 further CHARACTERIZED BY said weakened section in said catheter tube including at least one cut made through a major portion of the cross sectional area of said catheter tube so that said catheter tube breaks at said cut when pulled with sufficient force.
4. The self contained urinary catheter assembly of Claim 2 further CHARACTERIZED BY said weakened section in said catheter tube including a plurality of cuts made through the cross sectional area of said catheter tube so that a major portion of the cross-sectional area of said catheter tube is cut whereby said catheter tube breaks at said cuts when pulled with sufficient force.
5. The self contained urinary catheter assembly of Claim 2 further CHARACTERIZED BY said weakened section in said catheter tube including a peripherally extending cut made in said catheter tube so that a major portion of the cross sectional area of said catheter tube is cut so that said catheter tube breaks at said cut when pulled with sufficient force. 


 6. The self contained urinary catheter assembly of Claim 1 further CHARACTERIZED BY said mounting means including orienting means for orienting said mounting means in said flexible receptacle.
7. The self contained urinary catheter assembly of Claim 1 further CHARACTERIZED BY said mounting means including guide means for assisting in guiding said projecting end of said catheter tube into said catheter opening through said mounting means to permit said catheter to project from said flexible receptacle.
8. The self contained urinary catheter assembly of Claim 7 further CHARACTERIZED BY said guide means including a guide flange projecting into said closed chamber, said guide flange in registration with said catheter opening and having an arcuate cross-sectional shape conforming generally to a portion of the cross-sectional shape of said catheter tube so that said projecting end of said catheter tube can be laid in said guide flange to align said catheter with said catheter opening through said mounting means.
9. The self contained urinary catheter assembly of Claim 8 CHARACTERIZED BY further including gripping means to positively engage said catheter tube when said catheter is pressed against said gripping means to permit said catheter to be selectively fixed with respect to said mounting means while said catheter and said receptacle are being manipulated.
10. The self contained urinary catheter assembly of Claim 1 CHARACTERIZED BY further including a urethra penetrating protective member covering said catheter opening, said protective member having a self closing 


projecting end thereon adapted to be positioned into the discharge end of the user's urethra to isolate bacteria from said catheter and through which said catheter passes as said catheter is being used.
