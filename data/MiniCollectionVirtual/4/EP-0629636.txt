<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to lipopeptides with very homologous amino-acid sequences but different fatty acid residues (lipid portion) which are synthesised by Actinoplanes sp. during fermentation and released into the culture medium, to a process for isolating the lipopeptides from the culture medium and for purifying them, to the use of the lipopeptides as pharmacological agents, in particular against Gram-positive bacteria, and to Actinoplanes sp. DSM 7358 for the preparation of the abovementioned lipopeptides.

1
 has
a chain length of from 10 to 20, inclusive, carbon

atoms.
A lipopeptide as claimed in claim 1, wherein R

A process for the production of a lipopeptide of
the formula I as claimed in one or more of claims 1

to 8, which comprises fermenting Actinoplanes sp.
in a culture medium until one or more lipopeptides

accumulate in the culture medium and purifying the
lipopeptide of the formula I from the culture

medium.
The process as claimed in claim 9, wherein the
purification takes place by precipitating the lipopeptides

from the culture medium using acids at
pH 0.5 to pH; 4, inclusive, then where appropriate

purifying the lipopeptides obtained from the precipitation
by chromatography on anion exchangers or

chromatographic on a hydrophobic matrix, it being
possible for the to chromatographies to be carried

out as alternatives or consecutively in any desired
sequence. 
The process as claimed in claim 9 or 10, wherein
Actinoplanes sp. DSM 7358 is fermented.
A pharmaceutical containing one or more
lipopeptides of the formula I as claimed in one or

more of claims 1 to 8 and, where appropriate,
pharmaceutical vehicles.
The use of a lipopeptide of the formula I as
claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8 for the

production of an antibiotic against Gram-positive
bacteria.
The use as claimed in claim 13, wherein the
bacteria are glycopeptide-resistant bacteria.
Actinoplanes sp. DSM 7358.
