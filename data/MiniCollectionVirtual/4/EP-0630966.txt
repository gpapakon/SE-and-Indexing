<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an improved installation for anaerobic fermentation of organic materials. This installation comprises a plurality of nozzles (3, 4, 5) for pressurised injection of biogas into a fermenter (1), which nozzles are implanted on the perimeter of the fermenter in order to improve the flow of the materials in this fermenter as well as its efficiency, and are fed with biogas via a pipeline in the shape of two half-rings (8, 9) surrounding the fermenter (1) and connected to a biogas supply (11). This installation makes it possible to solve the problems of transit and fermentation of organic materials in large-volume fermenters.
