<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning system for increasing the packing density of a sump 
fill. The cleaning system has a blade (10) having an acute angle for 

removing residual particles from the photoreceptor surface (80) The acute 
angle of the blade creates a build up of toner and other residual particles 

on the cleaning blade. A support platen for the imaging surface is opposed 
to the cleaning blade to prevent damage to the imaging surface. The build 

up of toner and other residual particles is guided to the sump by a baffle 
causing tighter packing of the particles in the sump.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electrophotographic printing,
and more particularly, concerns an apparatus for cleaning the imaging
surface.Cleaning failures in CRUs (Customer Replacement Units) fall into
two basic categories. One is the broad band failures and, the second is fine
line failures. Broad band streaks are the most common type of cleaning
failure, and are predominantly caused by the effects of cleaner sump fill,
especially when the cleaner cavity is located above the cleaner as in a 12
o'clock blade cleaner. Fine line failures are caused by either debris trapped
under the blade, (i.e. paper fibers), or by nicks in the blade edge. However,
fine line failures occur at a much lower rate than broad band failures,
especially in a 12 o'clock blade cleaner.US-A-3,660,863 to Gerbasi discloses an elastomeric blade for
removing dry particulate material from a surface to which the particulate
material is electrostatically bonded. The elastomeric blade has an acute
angle in pressure contact with the surface.One object of the present invention is to strive to provide an
improved cleaning system to cause tighter packing of toner particles in the
sump. Accordingly, the present invention provides a cleaning apparatus in
accordance with any one of the appended claims.The present invention will be described further, by way of examples,
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-
Figure 1 is an elevational view of a CRU with an embodiment of
the present invention contained therein;Figure 2 is a prior art view of a 90° blade tip angle;Figure 3 is a view of an 80° tip angle of the present blade
cleaning apparatus;Figure 4 shows the forces exerted on the blade tip angle of 90°; Figure 5 shows the forces exerted on the blade tip angle of 80° in
the present invention; andFigure 6 graphically shows the experimental results of the toner
weight at failure for 80° and 90° blade tip angles.Referring now to Figure 1, which is a schematic diagram of the
cleaning system in a CRU. A photoreceptor belt 80 is rotated in the
direction of arrow 12. The blade 10, supported by a blade holder 20,
contacts the surface (i.e. imaging or photoconductive) of the photoreceptor
belt 80. The blade 10 has a cleaning edge for removing residual particles
from the photoreceptor belt 80. On the opposite side of the photoreceptor
belt 80 from the cleaning blade 10 is a blade support platen 70 to support
the flexible photoreceptor belt 80 under the load being applied to the
blade 10 for pressure contact with the photoreceptor

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for cleaning an imaging surface, including

a housing (40) defining a cavity (50);
a blade (10), at least partially enclosed in said housing, for
removing residual particles from said surface, said blade (10) having one

end coupled to said housing and a free end opposite thereto, said free end
having at least a first blade surface and a second blade surface, said first

blade surface being adjacent to said second blade surface defining an
acute angle therebetween, said free end further defining an edge between

said first blade surface and said second blade surface, said edge
contacting the imaging surface to remove residual particles therefrom;

guiding means (30) for guiding the residual particles cleaned from the imaging
surface into said cavity, said guiding means evenly packing the residual

particles in said cavity increasing holding capacity therein; and support
means for supporting the imaging surface opposed to said blade.
An apparatus as claimed in 
claim 1,
 wherein said edge
comprises a line where said second blade surface and said first blade

surface meet, said line contacts the imaging surface.
An apparatus as claimed in 
claim 1 or claim 2,
 wherein said
edge contacting the imaging surface causes the residual particles to build

up on said blade.
An apparatus as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 3,
 wherein
said support means comprises a blade platen (70).
An apparatus as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 4,
 wherein
said guiding means comprises a baffle (30).
An apparatus as claimed in 
claim 5,
 wherein said baffle, has a
first and a second end, said first end being coupled to said housing, and

said second end being free, extending from said housing toward the
imaging surface. 
An apparatus as claimed in 
claim 6,
 wherein said baffle is
enclosed in said housing.
An apparatus as claimed in 
claim 7,
 wherein said blade is
positioned subjacent to said baffle.
An apparatus as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 8,
 wherein
said acute angle ranges from approximately 75 degrees to 85 degrees

from the imaging surface.
