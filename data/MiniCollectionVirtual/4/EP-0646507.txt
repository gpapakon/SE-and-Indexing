<ABSTRACT>
A wiper blade arrangement is shown for use in a wiper mechanism 
including a harness (110) having claws (111) for connecting the 

harness (110) to the wiper blade arrangement. The wiper blade 
arrangement comprises a wiping element (20) having backing 

support means including longitudinally extending rails (30a, 
30b) received in longitudinally extending grooves in a head 

region of the wiping element. Formation means (31a, 31b,) located 
on at least one of said rails (30a, 30b) at or adjacent end 

zones thereof. The or each said formation means (31a, 31b) 
co-operate with a respective retaining means (13a, 13b) on a 

retaining clip member (10) so as to at least prevent each said 
clip member (10) moving longitudinally outwardly relative to 

said rails (30a, 30b). The or each clip member (10) includes a 
first inboard abutment means (40) adapted, in use, to engage an 

outer edge of an outer said claw (111) of the harness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in
wiper blade assemblies and in particular to means for
securing a resilient (elastomeric) wiping element to a
harness assembly therefor in a manner permitting the
wiping element to be replaced when worn but otherwise
enabling the wiping element to be securely held to the
harness during use.Commonly, in the prior art, elastomeric wiping elements
were individually moulded in relatively complicated
shapes so that the shape of the element
cooperated with other fastening arrangements on the
harness to releasably secure the wiping element
thereto. While these arrangements have worked satisfactorily,
they do have a number of practical disadvantages.
Firstly, the actual moulding processes required
for production of the wiping element are expensive particularly
where the mould is necessarily complicated
because of a complicated wiping element shape. Secondly,
such wiping elements are capable of use only
with one particular harness arrangement for which it
was developed and there is no prospect of being able to
interchange these wiping elements with other styles of
harness. U.S. Patent No. 3,153,254 illustrates an
arrangement of the aforementioned kind wherein a wiping
element is shaped by moulding so that it is configured
at least at its ends to accommodate a latch
including an end clip located at either end. A backing
strip is used to stiffen the wiping element and included
longitudinally extending legs received in grooves in the
wiping element with the legs being connected at one
end. The end clips each are bifurcated so that respective
legs fit on either side of a central web of the wiping
element. Outwardly facing notches of each of the legs of
the clip engage on inner and outer edges of an outer
claw of the harness. The harness also encompasses
the legs of the backing strip. The wiping element is configured
at either end to accommodate the end clips
which by their bifurcated configuration retain the wiping
element therebetween.Further to the foregoing, arrangements have also
been proposed in the prior art using extruded elastomeric
wiping elements which have essentially the same
cross-sectional shape along their complete lengths.
Such wiping elements can be produced very inexpensively
when compared to moulded elastomeric wiping
elements and are therefore to be preferred for this reason,
however it is still necessary to be able to provide
the wiping element with a simple backing support and
with means to reliably secure the wiping element and
the backing

<CLAIMS>
A clip member (10) adapted, in use, to secure a
wiper blade sub-assembly to a harness of a wiper

mechanism, said wiper blade sub-assembly comprising a
wiping element (20) and a backing support means including

longitudinally extending rails (30a, 30b) received in
longitudinally extending grooves in a head region of the

wiping element (20), said harness including a plurality of
claws (111) adapted to be slidably received over the head

region of said wiping element (20) including said rails
(30a, 30b), the clip member (10) including an inboard

first abutment means (40) adapted to engage an outer said
claw (111) of the harness and retainer means (45) adapted

to engage with a formation (47) on at least one of the
rails (30a, 30b) of the wiper assembly to prevent movement

of the clip member (10) outwardly relative to said rails
(30a, 30b), the clip member (10) further including second

abutment means (11) adapted, in use, to engage an end of
the wiping element (20) thereby preventing outward

movement of the wiping element (20) relative to the rails
(30a, 30b), the clip member being a generally U-shaped

housing body viewed in transverse cross-section having a
top wall (17) and two depending side walls (12a, 12b)

extending downwardly from said top wall (17),

characterised in that
 the top wall (17), incorporates a
flexible tang (43) detached from said si
de walls (12a,
12b), said tang being separated from the second abutment 

means (11) by a gap, and wherein the end region of the
tang nearest to the second abutment means (11) forms said

retainer means as a projection (45) extending down from
the tang (43), said projection (45) being adapted, in use,
