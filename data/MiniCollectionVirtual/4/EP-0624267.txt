<ABSTRACT>
In a method and a device for preventing unauthorised access to a computer system comprising at least one processing unit (1) or the like, a disc unit (3), a display (5), and a keyboard (7), use is made of a floppy disc (9). Information in the form of a personal identification code containing the name of an authorised user and an access code encrypted by means of a one-way encrypting function, and an authenticity code formed by a system access code and at least the personal identification code are recorded on the floppy disc. After insertion of the floppy into the disc unit, the computer system is adapted, in starting-up, to read at least the personal identification code and the authenticity code; to check the authenticity code by means of the system access code and the information recorded on the floppy disc and used to form the authenticity code; to request, via the display, the user to enter his name and access code in non-encrypted form via the keyboard; to encrypt the access code entered by the user; to check the read name against the entered name and, respectively, the read, encrypted access code against the entered access code which is then encrypted by the computer system; and to give the user access to the computer system merely in case of a positive result of all three checks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to protection
against unauthorised use of a computer system, e.g. a personal
computer, comprising a processing unit or the like,
a disc unit for floppy discs, a display and a keyboard.There are prior art techniques of preventing such
unauthorised access.A first variant means that the user has to identify
himself by a personal code via the keyboard, which code is
checked by software stored in the computer system against
one or more corresponding codes stored in the computer
system. When the personal code and the corresponding code
or one of the corresponding codes stored in the computer
system conform to each other, the user is allowed to use
the computer system, i.e. data or instructions entered by
the user are accepted and processed. However, the security
of this technique is not satisfactory.A second, more reliable variant has therefore been
developed. This requires the use of a card with a magnetic
strip or an integrated circuit in which the identity information
is stored. This requires, however, a special
card reader reading the identity information into the
computer system, which decides, based on either this
information only or a combination of this information and
a personal code entered via the keyboard, whether the user
is authorised or not. One drawback of this solution is
that it requires a special card reader.A third variant, see DK-A-6229/89, tries to eliminate
the last-mentioned drawback by providing a floppy disc
with an integrated circuit containing a processing part
and a memory part, and an interface via which the read and
write equipment in a disc unit for floppy discs can transfer
information between the integrated circuit and the
computer system in which the disc unit is included. Of 
course, this eliminates the need of a separate card
reader, but the special floppy disc will be complicated
because of the arrangement of the integrated circuit and
the associated interface, and since it requires a source
of current supply of its own, for example a built-in
battery.The object of the present invention therefore is to
provide a method for preventing unauthorised access to a
computer, and a device for carrying out the method,
which assure high security but do not require any additional
equipment in the form of e.g. cards, a card reader
or special integrated circuits.More precisely, according to the invention a personal
identification code is recorded on the floppy disc,
said personal identification code containing the user's
name in plain text and

Method for preventing access to a computer, comprising a
processing unit, a memory, a disc unit for floppy discs, a display

and a keyboard, 
characterised
 by the steps of

recording, on a floppy disc hereon indicated as
access disc, 
a
 personal identification code which is unique for
each user and includes the user's name recorded in plain text and

an encrypted access code, the encryption being carried out by
means of a one-way encryption function,
recording, on the same access disc, an authenticity code which is
formed by encrypting at least said personal identification code,

by means of using a function and a system access code
,
 wherein
said system access code is stored in a predetermined area of said

memory that is not accessible by said user but only by a system
administrator that is enabled to lock said memory
,
 and wherein
said function is a one-way encrypting function using said system

access code as a key,
inserting said access disc into the disc unit before the start-up
of said computer,
during the starting-up, said computer reading at least said
personal identification code and the authenticity code from said

access disc,
said computer then checking the authenticity of the information
read from said access disc by encrypting at least said personal

identification code by using said function and said system access
code as a key, there resulting therefrom a newly computed

authenticity code which is compared with the authenticity code
previously read from said access disc,
said computer subsequently, at least in the case of a positive
result of said check, requesting the user via the display to enter

his name and his access code in non-encrypted form via the
keyboard,
said computer checking, after the entering has been carried out,
the name previously read from the access disc against the entered

name,
said computer encrypting the entered access code, while using said
one-way encrypting function and said system access code as key

and, subsequently, checking the result against the read, encrypted
access code by using said encrypting function and said system

access code as key and comparing said newly encrypted access code
with the encrypted access code previously read from said access

discs, and
said computer giving the user access to said computer only in case
of a positive result of all three checks.
Method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised
 in
that information stating the extent of authorisation
,
 that is
stating to what extent said user is allowed to use said computer
,

is recorded in encrypted form on said access disc together with
the personal identification code, and wherein said information

[are] 
is
 decrypted only in the case of a positive result of all
the previous three checks, and wherein said computer gives the

user access to said computer to the extent stated by said
information.
Method as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised
 in
that the information about the extent of the authorisation is

encrypted and decrypted, wherein said user's name and said system
access code have been previously stored in said predetermined area

is enabled to lock said memory area.
Method as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised
 in

[en] 
an
 encrypting key which is a function of the combination of
the user's name and the system access code.

an
 access disc (9), on which information is recorded at least
in the form of a personal identification code which is unique for

each user and includes the user's name recorded in plain text and
an access code encrypted by means of a one-way encrypting

function, and an authenticity code formed [formed] by encrypting

at least said personal identification code by using said function
and said system access code as key
,
 wherein said system access
code is stored in a predetermined area of said memory that is not

accessible by said user but only by a system administrator that is
enabled to lock said memory
,
 and wherein said function is a one-way

encrypting function using said system access code as key, and
that said computer comprises means to read, after insertion of

said access disc into said disc unit, during starting-up, at least
