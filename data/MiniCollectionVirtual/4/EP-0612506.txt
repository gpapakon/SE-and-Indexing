<ABSTRACT>
A surgical scalpel (60) capable of making a controlled depth and 
width incision 

for inserting a trocar during endoscopic surgery. The scalpel (60) 
includes a handle (61) 

and a shield (62) slidably mounted on the handle between an extended 
position and a 

retracted position. When the shield is in the retracted position, a 
predetermined 

portion of a blade (80) mounted on the handle extends beyond 
the distal end (73) of the shield. 

The portion of blade extending beyond the distal end (73) of the shield 
is correlated to the 

position of the shank (63) in the shield so that a controlled depth and 
width incision 

can be made using the portion of the blade extending beyond the 
distal end of the 

shield. The distal end of the shield, therefore, provides a means for 
stopping the 

further insertion of the blade into a cavity wall and causes a 
predetermined depth 

and width starter incision to be made.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laparoscopic starter scalpel and, more 
particularly, relates to a surgical scalpel that makes a controlled depth and width 
incision for the insertion of a trocar. As practitioners-in-the-art of endoscopic surgery are aware, it has long been 
a goal to have an efficient surgical tool for making a controlled depth and width 
incision in the wall of an anatomical cavity for inserting a trocar into the cavity. Trocars are conventional operating instruments that are used to form a 
passageway through the wall of an anatomical cavity into the cavity. After a  
 
trocar has been inserted into the cavity other operating instruments such as 
endoscopes and arthoscopes can be inserted into the cavity through the 
passageway to perform medical procedures within the cavity. However, before a 
trocar can be inserted into a cavity a starter incision must be made in the wall of 
the cavity. Operating room personnel commonly use a conventional surgical scalpel 
having a blade similar to blades 11 and 15 shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively, 
to make the starter incision. However, since blades 11 and 15 only have one 
cutting edge and require the user to visually determine whether the size of the 
incision is sufficient to receive a trocar, these blades do not provide the cutting 
capability and control that is necessary when making a starter incision for 
receiving a trocar. For example, to make a starter incision in a wall of an anatomical cavity 
using a scalpel with blade 11, shown in Fig. 1, pressure is applied in the X 
direction with point 10 being in pressure contact with the wall of the cavity. As 
point 10 pierces the wall an incision is made in the wall by cutting edge 12. 
Opposite edge 13 of blade 11 does not have a cutting edge and therefore does not 
perform cutting. Pressure in the X direction is applied until the desired width of 
the incision is visually observed by the user. Similarly, when making a starter incision in the wall of a cavity using a 
scalpel with blade 15, shown in Fig. 2, only cutting edge 21 performs cutting. 
Pressure is applied to blade 15 in the Y direction as cutting edge 21 of blade 15 
is moved over the area of the cavity wall in which an incision is desired. The 
pressure on and movement of blade 15 continues until the desired size of the 
incision is visually observed by the user.  Other scalpels that could be used to make an incision for inserting a trocar 
are shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,906,626 (Riuli) and U.S. Patent No. 4,759,363

<CLAIMS>
A surgical scalpel comprising: 
   a handle having a distal and proximal end and a boss located at the 

distal end; and 
   a blade having a head portion with a point, a first and second cutting 

edge converging to said point, and an opening for receiving said boss when said 
blade is attached to said handle. 
A surgical scalpel according to Claim 1, wherein said head portion has a 
length of at least 14mm. 
A surgical scalpel according to Claim 1, wherein said head portion has a 
width of at least 7mm. 
A surgical scalpel according to Claim 1, wherein said blade includes a 
foot at the proximal end, and said handle includes a slanted abutment spaced 

from said boss for receiving said foot of said blade. 
A surgical scalpel according to Claim 1, wherein said blade has an 
arrow-shaped point. 
A surgical scalpel comprising: 
   a handle; 

   a shield having a distal end slidably mounted on said handle to slide 
 

between an extended position and a retracted position; 
   means for latching said shield on said handle in the retracted position 

so that said blade extends beyond said distal end of said shield by a 
predetermined distance; and 

   a blade having a first and second cutting edge attached to said handle. 
A surgical scalpel according to Claim 6, wherein said blade has an 
arrow-shaped head. 
A surgical scalpel according to Claim 6, wherein said latching means 
comprises: 

   an opening on said shield having a pair of indents; and 
   a resilient button on said handle having a pair of shoulders, 

   wherein said shoulders mate with said pair of indents to lock said shield in 
the retracted position. 
A surgical scalpel according to Claim 6, further comprising means for 
locking said shield on said handle in a fully-extended and locked position so that 

said blade is surrounded by said shield for disposal. 
A surgical scalpel according to Claim 9, wherein said locking means 
includes a locking abutment on said handle that engages a raised lip on said 

shield when said shield is in the fully-extended position.
