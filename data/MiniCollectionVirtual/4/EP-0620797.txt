<ABSTRACT>
A packaging device for doses of a pasty substance. The device consists of two sheets (1, 2) placed one on top of the other and rigidly welded together. The first, forming sheet (1) comprises, for each dose, a deformed portion (3) directed away from the joining surface and shaped as a recess defining a space (4) for receiving the pasty substance dose. The device further comprises an outlet (5) for the dose with one end open (6) and the other opening into the recess, as well as a flexible sealing membrane (8) acting as a partition (9) between the recess (3) and the outlet (5), and connected to said first sheet (1) containing the recess in the region of the outlet (5) so as to form a frangible seal. Said device is essentially characterized in that, in the region of said outlet (5), the first and second sheets are completely undeformed prior to welding, and in that said outlet (5) consists of an unwelded portion forming a channel between the first, sheet containing the recess and the second sheet.

Packaging device for measured quantities of a pasty 
substance, comprising a volume for housing the measured 

quantity of the pasty substance and means for sealing this 
volume, which can be opened for dispensation of said 

measured quantity of the pasty substance, said device being 
formed from two superposed sheets (1, 2) firmly welded to 

each other, of which the first, formable sheet (1) 
incorporates, for each measured quantity, a deformation 

extending away from the connection surface joining the two 
sheets and existing as a cavity (3) forming the volume (4) 

to house the measured quantity of the pasty substance, this 
device further comprising a duct (5) for the expulsion of 

the measured quantity of the pasty substance and forming a 
non-welded, passage-shaped area positioned between the 

first sheet (1) incorporating the cavity (3) and the second 
sheet (2), this duct (5) being open at one of its ends (6) 

and opening at the other end (7) into the cavity (3), and 
a flexible membrane (8) forming the sealing means, which 

produces a separation (9) between the cavity (3) and the 
duct (5) and which, in the duct (5) area, is assembled to 

said first sheet (1) incorporating the cavity (3) so as to 
form, at that spot, a fragile seal, characterized in that, 

at the site of the expulsion duct (5), either neither of 
the first and second sheets (1, 2) is deformed, the 

expulsion duct (5) then being formed exclusively as a 
result of the existence of the non-welded area, or else, 

the first sheet (1) is deformed, in this latter case the 
flexible membrane (8) taking on the shape of this 

deformation of the first sheet (1) in the area in which it 
is attached thereto, the second sheet (2) then being a flat 

sheet having a stiffness greater than that of the first 
sheet (1). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the fragile seal formed, in the expulsion duct (5), by 

the membrane (8) attached to said first sheet (1) 
incorporating the cavity (3) is made by a fragile bond  

 
joining the membrane (8) to said first sheet (1). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the fragile seal formed, in the expulsion duct (5), by 

the membrane (8) attached to said first sheet (1) 
incorporating the cavity, is made by a pre-notched weakened 

zone formed in the membrane (8). 
Process for the manufacture of a device for 
storage and dispensation of measured quantities of a pasty 

substance, in which cavities (3) are formed in a first 
sheet (1) made of a formable material, the cavities (3) are 

filled with measured quantities (4') of a pasty substance, 
a flexible membrane (8) is laid down at least partially on 

the cavities (3) and over the area which, in relation to 
each cavity, constitutes an expulsion duct (5) for that 

cavity, the flexible membrane (8) is bonded to the first 
sheet (1) at least in the area corresponding to the 

expulsion duct (5), a second sheet (2) covering the first 
sheet is arranged over the assembly thus produced, and the 

first and second sheets, including the flexible membrane, 
are firmly welded together, at least in the peripheral area 

of each cavity (3) and in the area extending between each 
cavity (3) and the corresponding edge of the device, while 

allowing a non-welded passage originating in the cavity (3) 
and ending at the edge to remain in this area, at the site 

of the expulsion duct (5), characterized in that the second 
sheet (2) used during the welding step is a flat sheet, and 

in that no deformation forming a passage serving as the 
expulsion duct is produced in the first sheet (1) prior to 

the welding operation. 
Process according to claim 4, characterized in 
that the flexible membrane (8) is placed over the sheet (1) 

incorporating the cavities (3) so as to extend beyond said 
cavities on all sides, in that the formable membrane (8) is 

welded to the sheet (1) incorporating the cavities (3) over 
the entire periphery of each cavity, in that the second 

sheet (2), which has a stiffness greater than that of the 
first sheet (1) incorporating the cavities (3), is placed  

 
over the assembly thus formed, in that the second sheet (2) 

is firmly heat-welded to the assembly composed of the first 
sheet (1) and the flexible membrane (8) over the entirety 

of their junction surface, with the exception of the areas 
occupied by the cavities (3) and of the passage joining 

each cavity (3) to the edge of the device and constituting 
an expulsion duct (5), the heat of the welding operation 

producing a durable bond between the first sheet (1), the 
membrane (8) and the second sheet (2) over the entirety of 

the welded area and producing, in the non-welded passage, 
a duct-shaped deformation of the first sheet (1) and the 

deformable membrane (8). 
Process according to any of the claims 4 or 5, 
characterized in that, in the step in which the flexible 

membrane (8) is attached to the sheet (1) incorporating the 
cavities (3), the bond produced by welding between said 

membrane (8) and this sheet (1) is a weak, fragile bond. 
Process according to any of the claims 4 or 5, 
characterized in that, prior to the operation in which the 

flexible membrane (8) is attached to the sheet (1) 
incorporating the cavities (3), the flexible membrane (8) 

is pre-notched in order to contain fragile weakened zones, 
and is then positioned over the sheet (1) incorporating the 

cavities (3), so that the pre-notched areas are placed at 
the sites of the passages between the cavities (3) and the 

edge of the device, said passages being formed during the 
subsequent operation, when the first sheet (1) is welded to 

the second sheet (2).
