<ABSTRACT>
Bacterium belonging to a new genus, and a process 
for production of carotenoid pigment selected from the 

group consisting of astaxanthin, adonixanthin, β-carotene, 
echinenone, canthaxanthin and zeaxanthin, 

comprising the steps of culturing a bacterium capable of 
producing at least one of the carotenoid pigments, and 

recovering an individual carotenoid pigments. 
The producer bacterium belongs to new genus. 
According to the present process various carotenoids 
can be produced in an industrial scale. By the present 

process (3S, 3'S)-astaxanthin can be produced in an 
almost 100% purity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides bacteria
belonging to a new genus, and a process for production of
carotenoids using a bacterium belonging to the new genus.
The carotenoids of the present inventions are natural
pigments useful for feed additives, food additives etc.
Especially, astaxanthin is valuable from an industrial
point of view as feed additive such as a color improver
for bred fishes such as salmon, trout, red sea bream
etc., and safe natural food additive. In addition,
adonixanthin is, if its industrial production process is
established, promising as food additive and feed
additive as the astaxanthin is.Further, β-carotene has been used as food
additive, feed additive, pharmaceutical etc.,
echinenone is promising as food additive, feed additive
etc.; canthaxanthin has been used as food additive, feed
additive, cosmetic etc.; and zeaxanthin has been used
as food additive, feed additive etc.It is known that astaxanthin is contained in
fishes such as red sea bream, salmon, trout, etc., and
Crustacea such as shrimps, crabs, crawfishes, krills
(Carotenoids of Marine Organisms; edt. Nippon Suisan
Gakukai, 1978). As microorganisms which produce
astaxanthin, red yeast Phaffiarhodozyma (Phytochemistry,
15, 1009, 1976), Brevibacterium (Journal of General and
Applied Microbiology, 15, 127, 1969), and green algea
Haematococcuspluvialis (Phytochemistry, 20, 2561, 1981)
are known. As chemical synthetic processes, conversion
of β-carotene (Pure Appl. Chem. 57, 741, 1985) and
synthesis from phosphonium salt (Helv. Chim. Acta. 64, 
2436, 1981) are known.However, the known processes for production of
astaxanthin are not advantageous due to high cost,
because a content of astaxanthin in natural products such
as krills, crawfishes, etc. is very low, and extraction
thereof is difficult. In addition, stable availability
of the resources is problematic. In addition, growth
rate of red yeast, Phaffiarhodozyma, is low,
productivity of astaxanthin by the red yeast is low, and
extraction of astaxanthin is difficult since this yeast
has hard cell walls. Therefore, industrial production of
astaxanthin from red yeast is difficult.A growth rate of green algea, Haematococcuspluvialis,
is also low, the culture is easily
contaminated, and extraction of astaxanthin is difficult.
Therefore industrial production of astaxanthin from
red algea is difficult.It is known that adonixanthin is contained in
goldfishes and carps (Carotenoids of Marine Organisms,
Nippon Suisan Gakukai, 1978), but it is believed that
chemical synthesis of
