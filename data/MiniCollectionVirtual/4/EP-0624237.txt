<ABSTRACT>
Described is a switching device (1) for instantaneous water heaters, which switches the water-heating device (2) on and off as a function of water throughput. The switching device has a cylindrical switch element (11, 11'; 111, 111'), made for instance of metal, movably mounted in a vertical section of the flow line (10, 10'; 141, 141'), the switch element being moved, at a given water flow rate, by the water flowing through, from a lower (rest) position to an upper (switching) position. The switching device also has a position sensor (16, 16') which detects the change in position of the moving switch element (11, 11'; 111, 111'), the position sensor preferably taking the form of a light-barrier switch with a light source (17; 147, 147') and a photo-detector (18; 146, 146') and which is connected to a switch (19) controlling the heating device (2).
