<ABSTRACT>
A clocking disable and enable circuit is provided 
having an input for receiving a clocking signal and another 

input for receiving a disable/enable signal. The disable 
and enable circuit provides a clocking disable/enable output 

from the circuit which is synchronized with the clocking 
signal during times in which the disable/enable signal is 

not activated. At times during which the disable/enable 
signal is activated, the clocking disable/enable signal 

transitions after at least a one half clocking period to a 
steady state value (either high or low voltage level). 

After the disable/enable signal becomes inactive again, 
clocking disable/enable signal automatically resynchronizes 

to the clocking signal. The clocking disable and enable 
circuit herein is well suited for providing glitch-free 

transition between a clocking state and a steady state to a 
synchronized digital or analog circuit which depends upon 

clocking synchronization for its operation. The clocking 
disable and enable circuit herein is also well suited for 

providing temporary halt to the connected digital or analog 
circuit as well as providing periods of selective 

demodulation associated with frequency tracking 
communication systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic circuit and more
particularly to a synchronized clocking disable and enable
circuit.A clocking circuit used for generating a plurality of pulses
is well known. The pulses are preferably produced with extreme
regularity and are often synchronized with the operation of
digital circuits attached to the output of the clocking circuit.
The clocking pulses are thereby used to control the speed of
operation of the digital circuits which may be contained on the
same monolithic circuit as that of the clocking circuit.In order to ensure optimal performance of the digital
circuit receiving the pulses, each pulse must have a set duration
and the duration must not substantially vary. For example, a
high level voltage pulse must remain high for a minimum duration
but not to exceed that of a maximum duration. Likewise, a low
level voltage pulse must also remain low more than and less than
a minimum and maximum duration, respectively. If a high or low
pulse is less than an acceptable time duration, then a "glitch"
may occur causing possible failure of the connected digital
circuits.It is oftentimes desirable to temporarily disable the stream
of clocking pulses produced from the clocking circuit. By
disabling the clocking pulses, certain attached digital circuits
can be temporarily placed in a halt condition. For example,
microprocessor or microcontroller operations can generally be
halted in such a manner. To perform a temporary disable of the 
clocking pulses, a clocking disable and enable circuit is
generally placed between the clocking circuit and the
corresponding digital circuits. The clocking disable and enable
circuit receives free-running, continuous periods of clocking
pulses, and also receives a disable signal which can exceed
several clocking periods. When the disable signal is activated,
the clocking disable and enable circuit sends to the digital
circuits a steady state output indicating a momentary halt of
clocking pulses. During the time in which the clocking disable
and enable circuit receives the disable signal, a transitional
glitch often occurs in the output of conventional disable and
enable circuits causing the connected digital circuits to
malfunction. The glitch, defined herein as a clocking pulse
having a duration less than the target pulse duration, may cause
the attached digital circuits to lose or misplace operational
status or data (stored or modulated data). Accordingly, many
conventional disable and enable circuits generally provide one or
more
