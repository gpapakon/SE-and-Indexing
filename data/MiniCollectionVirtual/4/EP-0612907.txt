<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The plastic retaining means (9) is configured such that it can be fixed on the glazing bar in a frictionally and positively locking manner and, together with the glazing bar, forms a structural unit which can be inserted into the frame profile and also removed from the frame profile. 2.2 The plastic retaining means (9) exhibits a baseplate (10) which is provided, at the free border, with an assembly moulding (11) which is shaped outwards and upwards from the plane of the baseplate and is mounted in front of a clamping jaw. The plastic retaining means is further equipped with an extension arm (19) which is equipped, at the free end, with a latching hook (20) for engaging behind a latching surface of the glazing bar (8). 2.3 The plastic retaining means (9) and the structural unit comprising glazing bar (8) and plastic retaining means (9) are used in the frame construction method for windows and doors.

<CLAIMS>
A plastics holder (9) comprising a portion (15) which can 
embrace a fixing foot (7) of a holding bar (8), which fixing foot can be 

introduced into a groove (6) of undercut configuration of a shaped frame 
member (2) of a window or a door, a base plate (10) which can be 

supported against the edge strip (13) of the undercut-configuration 
groove, which is at the glass pane or filling panel side, and a 

cantilever arm (19) which can be supported against a wall of the holding 
bar (8), which extends parallel to the glass pane or filling panel, 

characterised in that the base plate (10) has at the free edge a fitting 
strip (11) which is shaped out of the plane of the base plate and which 

faces away from the embraceable portion (15) and outwardly and which is 
mounted in front of a clamping mouth (12), and the cantilever arm (19) 

has at the free end a retaining hook (20) for engaging behind a retaining 
surface of the glass holding bar (8). 
A plastics holder according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the fitting strip (11) is of an arcuate cross-sectional configuration. 
A plastics holder according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the cantilever arm (19) is provided at a spacing from the retaining hook 

(20) at the side which is towards the embraceable portion (15) with a 
projection portion (26) which can bear against the fixing foot of the 

glass holding bar (8). 
A plastics holder according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the base plate (10) and the portion (15) of the plastics holder (9), for 

embracing the fixing foot of the glass holding bar (8), define a clamping 
mouth (12) for receiving the edge strip (13), which is towards the pane, 

of the groove (6) of the shaped frame member, and the width of opening of 
the clamping mouth (12) is smaller than the thickness of the edge strip 

(13).  
 
A plastics holder according to claim 4 characterised in that 
the embraceable portion (15) is in the form of a U-shaped tongue. 
A plastics holder and associated glass holding bar according to 
one of the preceding claims characterised in that the plastics holder (9) 

is positively lockingly and force-lockingly secured to the fixing foot 
and in a groove (21) of the glass holding bar (8) at the end of the 

fixing foot, which goes into the glass holding bar (8), and the unit 
comprising the glass holding bar (8) and the plastics holder (9) is fixed 

to the frame by introducing the fixing foot and the portion (15) of the 
plastics holder which embraces the fixing foot into the groove (6) of 

undercut configuration in the frame. 
A plastics holder and associated glass holding bar according to 
claim 6 characterised in that at its free end the fixing foot has a foot 

plate (16) which is embraced by a tongue of the plastics holder, the free 
end of the tongue engaging around a projection (18) on the foot plate 

(16). 
A plastics holder and associated glass holding bar according to 
claim 7 characterised in that the foot plate (16) is of smaller thickness 

in the front region (17) than in the rearward region and the tongue of 
the plastics holder fills with its material the step configuration of the 

foot plate (16). 
A plastics holder and associated glass holding bar according to 
claim 6 characterised in that the groove (21) at the end of the fixing 

foot which goes into the glass holding bar (8) is defined by a part of 
the fixing foot and a limb (23), the retaining hook (20) of the 

cantilever arm (19) engages behind a retaining surface of the limb (23) 
and the cantilever arm (19) has at one side a resilient lip (25) which is 

supported against the part of the fixing foot. 
A plastics holder and associated glass holding bar according to 
claim 4 characterised, in that there is a linear contact between the base 

plate (10) and the edge strip (13) at the transition of the fitting strip 
(11) into the base plate (10).
