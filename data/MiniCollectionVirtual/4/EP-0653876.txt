<ABSTRACT>
A contactless image sensor comprises a light 
source (1,2) for irradiating the light onto an original, 

photoelectric converting elements for photoelectrically 
converting the light from the original (4), an image pickup 

device (7) for guiding the light from the original to the 
photoelectric converting elements (9), and a frame body (10) for 

holding them. The frame body includes a light 
transmitting portion (6) and a light non-transmitting 

portion and they are integrally pressing-out molded by 
plastics. Namely, the optical path portion (6) and the 

optical guide (3) of the frame body are made of transparent 
plastics and the other portions of the frame body are 

made of colored plastics having a light shielding 
performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a contact type
image sensor according to the preamble of claim 1 and, more particularly, to a contact type
image sensor having a frame body to hold a light source
to irradiate a light onto an original, photoelectric
converting elements for photoelectrically converting
the light from the original, and a lens array
for guiding the light from the original to an array of
the photoelectric converting elements.Hitherto, as shown in a cross sectional view in
Fig. 7, a conventional contact type image sensor is constructed in a
manner such that a sensor array 8 corresponding to a
length of an original to be read, a point light source
array 1 in which a plurality of point light sources 2
for irradiating an original surface are arranged in a
line on a board, an image pickup device array 7 to form
an image of the light from the original onto a light
receiving portion of photoelectric converting elements
9 on the sensor array 8, and a cover glass 11 to
support the original are positioned and fixed to one
frame body 10.As a point light source array 1, LED elements are
generally used from a viewpoint of a low electric power 
consumption and a long life. The LED elements are
attached in a line on a board made of a material such
as glass epoxy or the like together with registers for
current limitation by soldering or the like.However, in the above conventional contact type
image sensor, there are the following problems.
(1) That is, in the above conventional sensor,
since the cover glass 11 and the frame body 10 are the
individual parts, they become causes of an increase in
costs because of the reasons such that the number of
parts is large and a process for adhering the cover
glass 11 to the frame body 10 in order to position and
fix the cover glass is needed and the like.(2) It is difficult to completely eliminate a
height difference between the cover glass 11 and the
framing body 10 in terms of the precision. Therefore,
in case of a reading apparatus of a sheet through type,
in order to prevent that the original collides with the
height different portion, it is necessary to take a
countermeasure such that a Mylar sheet is adhered to
the height different portion or the like, so that it
also becomes a cause of an increase in costs.(3) There is also a technical subject as follows.
A soldering ball at the time when the LED elements of
the LED array are soldered or a foreign matter such as
a board scrap from an LED board cut surface or the like
adhered to the light source is moved onto an
