<ABSTRACT>
An acoustic probe comprising a piezoelectric ceramic transducer element energisable to emit ultrasonic signals in a first direction and in a second direction opposite to the first, and mountable on a sample to be tested so as to transmit thereto signals emitted in the said first direction, is further provided, according to the invention, with a rod-shaped acoustic waveguide having one end coupled to the transducer element to receive signals emitted by the transducer element in the said second direction and to transmit them along the waveguide, with lossy cladding material acoustically coupled to the surface of the waveguide at least at a part thereof remote from its one end, and with coupling means surrounding and mechanically secured and acoustically coupled to the ceramic element and the said one end of the waveguide, the coupling means having a surface adapted to be secured to the sample to be tested and to transmit thereto signals emitted by the transducer element.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ACOUSTIC NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING This invention relates to the non-destructive testing of materials, and in particular of materials such as concrete which are essentially non-homogeneous and which, at conventional ultrasound frequencies, would produce such a high degree of scattering that commonly used ultrasound techniques are not suitable.Ultrasound frequencies used in non-destructive testing of materials and in medical investigations are commonly greater than 1 MHz, whereas in highly scattering media only relatively low frequencies, below 1 MHz in any event and, in the case of concrete for example, preferably below 500 KHz, can be used. At these lower frequencies plane wave transducers would need to be unreasonably large and, moreover, when detecting incoherent waves produced in scattering media would be subject to phase cancellation effects. Hence new techniques and devices are required which are suitable for use in connection with scattering media; and 1t is an object of the present invention to provide an effectively point-source transmit/receive transducer suitable for such applications and, preferably, capable of wideband operation and suitable for short pulse or chirp operation, at low-ultrasound frequencies.According to the invention there is provided an acoustic probe comprising a piezoelectric ceramic transducer element adapted to emit ultrasonic signals in a first direction and in a second direction opposite to the first, and mountable on a sample to be tested so as to transmit thereto signals emitted in the said first direction, characterised in that the probe also comprises a rod-shaped acoustic waveguide having one end coupled to the transducer element to receive signals emitted by t1- -â–  transducer element 1n the said second direction and to transmit them along the waveguide, lossy cladding material acoustically coupled to the surface of the waveguide at least at a part thereof remote from its one end, and coupling means surrounding 

 and mechanically secured and acoustically coupled to the ceramic element and the said one end of the waveguide, the coupling means having a surface adapted to be secured to the sample to be tested and to transmit thereto signals emitted by the transducer element. In preferred embodiments of the invention, in which the transducer element has the shape of a circular disc and the rod-shaped waveguide is also of circular cross-section and is arranged co-axial with the transducer element, the diameter of the waveguide is in the range 50% to 707. greater than
