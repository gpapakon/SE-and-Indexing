<ABSTRACT>
Compounds are provided having the capability of binding therapeutically active substances to lipid containing bio-compatible particles, such as cells or viruses. These compounds include a bio-affecting moiety, comprising a therapeutically active substance, which is linked via a linking moiety to at least one hydrocarbon substituent selected so that the compounds is sufficiently non-polar to impart lipid binding capability to the compound. Thus, compounds of the invention are useful for site-selective delivery of therapeutic agents, and retention thereof at the selected site. Methods are provided for using various compounds of the invention in treatment of diseases or other pathological conditions. For example, methods are provided for treatment of: (1) post-angioplasty restenosis; (2) rheumatoid arthritis; (3) tumor cell proliferation, particularly tumor cells associated with ovarian cancer; and (4) psoriasis.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOUNDS, COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR BINDING BIO-AFFECTING SUBSTANCES TO SURFACE MEMBRANES OF BIO-PARTICLESThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 189,192, filed May 2, 1988, entitled "Compounds, Compositions and Methods for Binding Bio-Affecting Substances to Surface Membranes of Bio-Particles".Field of the nventionThe present invention relates to compounds, compositions and methods for binding bio-affecting substances, such as therapeutic and, optionally, diagnostic agents, to bio-compatible particles, including both viable cells and viruses, and non- viable carrier particles. This invention is also directed to starting materials and intermediates used in the preparation of such compounds. The invention also relates to the use of the compounds for site- selective delivery of therapeutic and, optionally, diagnostic agents in vivo .Background InformationThe delivery of therapeutic agents for the treatment of diseases and other pathological conditions may be accomplished by various means. These include oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, transdermal, intramuscular administration or topical 

 application. For some therapeutic agents, the existing modes of delivery either are unable to deliver sufficient dosages to the disease site without adverse systemtic side effects or are unable to allow sufficient retention of the therapeutic product at the disease site for a time sufficient to produce the intended therapeutic effect.Drugs that prevent or reduce the proliferation of pathological cell types are essential to the treatment and control of various diseases involving undesirable or uncontrolled cell proliferation. But antiproliferatives, by definition, must be toxic to certain cell types. It is often not feasible to administer these drugs systemically, because the amounts needed to control the diseased cell types may be toxic or deadly to the patient's normal cells. This difficulty could be circumvented by administering antiproliferative agents directly to the site of the undesired cell proliferation. A mechanism is also needed for retaining antiproliferative agents at the disease site, so that they may effectively control the proliferation of undesired cells, while being restrained from migrating and damaging normal cell types. Specific diseases and conditions for which site-specific delivery and retention of anti¬ proliferatives would be particularly effective are briefly described below. Each of these conditions involves the proliferation of a particular
