<ABSTRACT>
A method of constructing or reconstituting 
a shaft (12) and paddle (22) assembly for mixers and 

processors wherein radially aligned paddles on 
parallel shafts revolving at the same speed in the 

same direction of rotation both co-wipe and 
completely wipe the interior of the barrel of the 

mixer or processor which has a mixer chamber 
comprising interconnecting cylindrical bores. The 

co-wiping paddles are formed with paddle bores (BR) of a 
configuration comprising alternating lobular 

projections (38) and root recesses (39), and arcuate corner 
portions (43) on the lobular projections and root 

recesses. The arcuate corner portions of the 
projections are tangential to the arcuate corner 

portions of the root recesses. The shafts are 
formed with intermeshing matching projections and 

root recesses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of constructing or
reconstructing drive assemblies according to claim 1 and to
a drive assembly having a shaft and an element in driving
interrelationship therewith according to claim 6.The present invention especially refers to twin
screw mixers, extruders or processors and, more
particularly, to new and useful improvements in
methods of making the paddle shaft assemblies which
are employed to enable increases in the mixing power
obtained without consequent reduction of the free
volume in the twin screw mixer or compounder which
would limit the volume of throughput material
proceeding through such continuously operating
machines.The present invention has been developed
for use in twin screw mixing-compounding machines of
the type used in the plastics industry, for example,
and illustrated in the present assignee's prior
patents US 3,195,868 and US 4,826,323. The larger
machines of this type utilize preferably hydraulic
motor-driven shafts with radially mating co-wiping,
individual paddles, or worm sections thereon, both
of which, hereinafter, are to be included within the
term "paddle", as used hereinafter. In machines of
this character, the shafts which mount the paddles
must be rotated at the same speed, and in the same
direction of rotation, in order for the paddles to
completely co-wipe one another, and, at the same
time, completely wipe the interior of the barrel 
bore in which they are operative. Whether the
paddle employed is of the single or multi-lobe type,
the geometry of the surface of one of the paddle
components must be generated by the mating paddle
component for co-wiping to occur, and these
geometric forms are a direct function of barrel bore
diameter to shaft center-to-center distance.
Normally, to increase the power supplied to the
paddles of such machines for mixing purposes and
increased output, it is necessary to increase the
dimensions of both the paddles and the shafts which
drive them, to carry the increased loads at
acceptable stress levels. However, to increase
shaft diameter for a machine having a given size
barrel, it is necessary to alter the bore to center-to-center
distance ratio of the twin screw-paddle
assembly, which adds to its width. The paddle
component wall thickness, accordingly, increases in
relationship to the increased shaft diameter and,
with thicker paddle elements, the open volume of the
machine for the same bore diameter is significantly
decreased. Thus, present day machines which are to
produce an increased rate of
