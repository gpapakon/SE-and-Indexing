<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved industrial 
process for the preparation of 4-methoxy-2,2',6'-trimethyldiphenylamine 
useful as an intermediate for 
the production of a color-forming agent for heat-sensitive 
or pressure-sensitive recording papers. 4-Methoxy-2,2',6'-trimethyldiphenylamine has 
heretofore been prepared by dehydrobromination and 
deacylation of an acetylation product of 2-methyl-4-methoxyaniline 
and 2,6-dimethylbromobenzene or of 1-bromo-4-methoxy-2-methylbenzene 
and an acetylation product 
of 2,6-dimethylaniline. These conventional processes are, however, accompanied 
by drawbacks such as complex reaction steps 
and a low reaction velocity. With a view toward overcoming 
such drawbacks, the present inventors previously 
proposed a process for the preparation of 4-methoxy-2,2',6'-trimethyldiphenylamine 
in which 2,6-dimethylphenol 
is used as a hydrogen acceptor. While forming 
2,6-dimethylhexanone in the reaction system, 2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone  
 
is reacted with 2-methyl-4-methoxyaniline 
in the presence of a hydrogen transfer 
catalyst to prepare 4-methoxy-2,2',6'-trimethyldiphenylamine 
(Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 
193949/1985, US-A-4 804 783). Although this 
process has simplified the reaction steps and improved 
the reaction velocity, the process cannot be considered 
as an industrially satisfactory process, because the 
process has a drawback such as poor selectivity to 4-methoxy-2,2',6'-trimethyldiphenylamine. 
Accordingly, 
there is still need for further improvement in the process.  
 In addition to the above, EP-A-0 103 990 discloses a process 
for preparing diarylamines from alicyclic ketones, a primary 
aromatic amine, and a hydrogen acceptor in the presence of a 
platinum metal catalyst and an acid promoter. EP-A-0 470 460 discloses a process for preparing azomethines 
by the condensation of cycloalkanones and anilines in the presence 
of acid catalyst with azeotropic removal of the water of 
reaction.  
 With a view toward improving the method disclosed 
in US-A-4 804 783 referred to above and thus 
establishing an industrially advantageous process, the 
present inventors have proceeded with an investigation. As a result, it has been found that the target 
product can be obtained in a higher yield by removing 
the resultant hydrogen and water from the reaction system 
as much as possible. The present invention therefore provides a process 
for the preparation of 4-methoxy-2,2',6'-trimethyldiphenylamine, 
which comprises heating and  
 
reacting
