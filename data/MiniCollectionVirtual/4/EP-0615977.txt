<ABSTRACT>
There are disclosed certain novel compounds identified as 
spiro piperidines and homologs which promote the release of growth 

hormone in humans and animals. This property can be utilized to 
promote the growth of food animals to render the production of edible 

meat products more efficient, and in humans, to treat physiological or 
medical conditions characterized by a deficiency in growth hormone 

secretion, such as short stature in growth hormone deficient children, 
and to treat medical conditions which are improved by the anabolic 

effects of growth hormone. Growth hormone releasing compositions 
containing such spiro compounds as the active ingredient thereof are 

also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Growth hormone, which is secreted from the pituitary,
stimulates growth of all tissues of the body that are capable of growing.
In addition, growth hormone is known to have the following basic
effects on the metabolic processes of the body:
1. Increased rate of protein synthesis in all cells of the body;2. Decreased rate of carbohydrate utilization in cells of the
body;3. Increased mobilization of free fatty acids and use of fatty
acids for energy.A deficiency in growth hormone secretion can result in
various medical disorders, such as dwarfism.Various ways are known to release growth hormone. For
example, chemicals such as arginine, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
(L-DOPA), glucagon, vasopressin, and insulin induced hypoglycemia, as
well as activities such as sleep and exercise, indirectly cause growth
hormone to be released from the pituitary by acting in some fashion on
the hypothalamus perhaps either to decrease somatostatin secretion or to
increase the secretion of the known secretagogue growth hormone
releasing factor (GRF) or an unknown endogenous growth hormone-releasing
hormone or all of these.In cases where increased levels of growth hormone were
desired, the problem was generally solved by providing exogenous
growth hormone or by administering GRF or a peptidal compound
which stimulated growth hormone production and/or release. In either
case the peptidyl nature of the compound necessitated that it be 
administered by injection. Initially the source of growth hormone was
the extraction of the pituitary glands of cadavers. This resulted in a
very expensive product and carried with it the risk that a disease
associated with the source of the pituitary gland could be transmitted to
the recipient of the growth hormone. Recently, recombinant growth
hormone has become available which, while no longer carrying any risk
of disease transmission, is still a very expensive product which must be
given by injection or by a nasal spray.Other compounds have been developed which stimulate the
release of endogenous growth hormone such as analogous peptidyl
compounds related to GRF or the peptides of U.S. Patent 4,411,890.
These peptides, while considerably smaller than growth hormones are
still susceptible to various proteases. As with most peptides, their
potential for oral bioavailability is low. The instant compounds are
non-peptide analogs for promoting the release of growth hormone
which are stable in a variety of physiological environments and which
may be administered parenterally, nasally or by the oral
