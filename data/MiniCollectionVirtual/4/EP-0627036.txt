Fixing (10) for a roof sealing strip (46) or the like, 
consisting of a holder (16) and of a securing device (14) 

penetrating said holder and the sealing strip (46) beneath 
it which is connected with the holder (16) in a pivotable 

and force-locking manner, presses the latter against the 
upper side of the sealing strip (46) and is anchored in the 

substructure (52),
characterized in that
 
the holder (16) is capped by a cover (12) on the upper side 

(21) of which is arranged a device (20) for torque 
transmission (21) and on the underside (26) of which is 

constructed a coupling engaging the upper end (28) of the 
securing device (14) in a longitudinally displaceable 

manner, said coupling connecting the securing device (14) 
with the cover (12) only in the region of its upper end 

position so as to be secured against rotation, and in that 
the free edge (18) of the cover (12) surrounding the holder 

(16) is tightly connected with the sealing strip (46) lying 
below. 
Fixing according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the coupling of the cover (12) has the form of a blind hole 

(22) the walls of which show a profile suitable for torque 
transmission in the same way as the upper end (28) of the 

securing device (14). 
Fixing according to claim 2,
characterized in that
 
in its bottom, the blind hole (22) shows a slot-like cavity 

(24) and the upper end (28) of the securing device (14) a 
blade-shaped set-off (30) engaging into it.  

 
Fixing according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 
the securing device (14) shows a head (32) at its upper end 

(28) with a cap-shaped underside and that the opening (38) 
in the holder (16) accommodating the securing device (14) 

is surrounded by a ball socket-shaped hollow (40). 
Fixing according to one of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that
 
the holder (16) is detachably connected to the underside 

(26) of the cover (12). 
Fixing according to one of the claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that
 
the cover (12) is made of an impact-resistant material. 
Fixing according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that
 
the cover (12) consists entirely or at least in its edge 

(18) area lying on the sealing strip (46) of a material 
which can be bonded to the sealing strip by friction 

welding.
