<ABSTRACT>
A knowledge tree building system iteratively partitions a database (28a-28n) of case records into a tree of conceptually meaningful clusters (74). Each cluster (74) is automatically assigned a unique conceptual meaning in accordance with its unique pattern of typicality and exceptionality within the knowledge tree (28); no prior domain-dependent knowledge is required. The system fully utilizes all available quantitative and qualitative case record data. Knowledge trees built by the system are particularly well suited for artificial intelligence applications such as pattern classification and nonmonotonic reasoning.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to machine learning, and more
particularly to a system for extracting conceptually
meaningful clusters from a database of case records by
implementation of symbolic empirical learning and to a
corresponding method of parsing data.In an article entitled "Models of Incremental Concept
Formation" published in the journal Artificial
Intelligence, volume 40, pages 11 - 61 (1989) Elsevier,
Gennari et al discuss various models of incremental
concept formation which integrate the process of
recognition and learning.Moreover, a method of automating design by using
case-based reasoning and learning is disclosed in a
conference publication by Tsatsoulis, which is published
on pages 509 - 518 of the Proceedings of the Second
International Conference on Industrial and Engineering
Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems
held at the University of Tennessee Space Institute
(UTSI), Tullahoma, Tennessee, on June 6 - 9, 1989.In these prior art models and methods, a sequential
presentation of instances is required. Each instance is
compared to statistical descriptions of previously
presented instances. The result of such comparisons
depends strongly on the presentation sequence.These and other earlier systems for partitioning case
records into clusters suffer from two severe limitations:
first, they fail to provide sufficient means for fully 
utilizing all available quantitative case record data; and
second, they fail to provide sufficient means for
extracting conceptually meaningful clusters in the absence
of prior domain-dependent knowledge.According to a first aspect of the invention there is
provided a conceptual clustering system comprising:
retrieval means for retrieving summary data that are
characteristic of a plurality of case records, wherein a
case record includes case record data representative of a
known value of at least one of a qualitative and a
quantitative case record variable, and wherein the case
record data is adapted to be representative of an unknown
value;comparison means for generating comparison signals
representative of a plurality of distances between case
records in accordance with stored case record data values;partitioning means for selectively partitioning the
plurality of case records in accordance with the
comparison signals to form sibling child clusters
therefrom;processor means for calculating summary data
characteristic of each sibling child cluster; andstorage means for storing the calculated summary
data,
characterised in that the comparison
