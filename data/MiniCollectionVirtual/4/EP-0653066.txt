<ABSTRACT>
Methods for labeling a material are disclosed. The methods comprise combining with the material (a) a photosensitizer capable upon irradiation of generating singlet oxygen and (b) a chemiluminescent compound capable of being activated by singlet oxygen wherein the photosensitizer and the chemiluminescent compound are incorporated in a particulate matrix or a non-particulate solid matrix. The particulate matrix can be solid or fluid. The methods allow for generating delayed luminescence, which can be realized upon irradiation of the matrix. The methods have application to the determination of an analyte in a medium suspected of containing the analyte. One method comprises subjecting a medium suspected of containing an analyte to conditions under which a complex of specific binding pair (sbp) members is formed in relation to the presence of the analyte and determining whether the sbp member complex has formed by employing as a label a single composition having both chemiluminescent and photosensitizer properties. Upon activation of the photosensitizer property singlet oxygen is generated and activates the chemiluminescent property. Compositions and kits are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photoactivatable chemiluminescent matrices
and to methods, compositions and kits for determining an analyte in a
sample.The clinical diagnostic field has seen a broad expansion in recent
years, both as to the variety of materials (analytes) that may be readily
and accurately determined, as well as the methods for the determination.
Convenient, reliable and non-hazardous means for detecting the presence of
low concentrations of materials in liquids is desired. In clinical
chemistry these materials may be present in body fluids in concentrations
below 10-12 molar. The difficulty of detecting low concentrations of these
materials is enhanced by the relatively small sample sizes that can be
utilized.In developing an assay there are many considerations. One
consideration is the signal response to changes in the concentration of
analyte. A second consideration is the ease with which the protocol for
the assay may be carried out. A third consideration is the variation in
interference from sample to sample. Ease of preparation and purification
of the reagents, availability of equipment, ease of automation and
interaction with material of interest are some of the additional
considerations in developing a useful assay.One broad category of techniques involves the use of a receptor which
can specifically bind to a particular spacial and polar organization of a
labeled ligand as a function of the presence of the analyte. The observed
effect of binding by the receptor will depend upon the label. In some
instances the binding of the receptor merely provides for a differentiation
in molecular weight between bound and unbound labeled ligand. In other
instances the binding of the receptor will facilitate separation of bound
labeled ligand from free labeled ligand or it may affect the nature of the
signal obtained from the label so that the signal varies with the amount of
receptor bound to labeled ligand. A further variation is that the receptor
is labeled and the ligand unlabeled. Alternatively, both the receptor and
ligand are labeled or different receptors are labeled with different labels
where the labels interact when in close proximity and the amount of ligand
present affects the degree to which the labels of the receptor may
interact.There is a continuing need for new and accurate techniques that can
be adapted for a wide spectrum of different ligands or be used in specific
cases where other methods may not be readily adaptable.Homogeneous immunoassays have previously been described for
