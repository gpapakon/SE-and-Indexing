<ABSTRACT>
Method, system and apparatus are disclosed for invessel composting of organic material. A compost handling apparatus moves forwardly through a bed of composting material in an elongate open bay. Specifically, an agitator comprises feed means such as a transversely mounted cylindrical drum, which feeds composting material to a conveyor which lifts the material and projects it rearwardly behind the agitator. Regulator means, such as an adjustable deflector, controls the discharge of composting material by the conveyor. The deflector is adjusted as the agitator moves forward through the composting material to develop a level bed in the bay behind the agitator. Sensor means may be employed to generate a depth signal corresponding to the depth of the composting material for controlling the deflector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an in-vessel 
method, system and apparatus for composting material, 
such as municipal and/or industrial sludges and so-called 
green stream materials. Composting is well recognized as an 
environmentally sound and economical means of recycling 
a variety of organic materials, and is increasingly 
becoming an important part of municipal and industrial 
solid waste management programs. Various composting 
technologies are available or are being developed, 
including static pile composting, windrow composting, 
aerated-windrow composting, and in-vessel composting 
employing, for example, circular reactors, horizontal 
agitated bay or bin reactors and vertical reactors. In all such systems there is need for cost 
effectiveness, including especially capital cost and 
operating cost effectiveness, and suitability for 
automation. Regarding capital costs, reducing the 
space required for a given throughput of composting 
material is a well recognized need in the industry. 
Composting operations employing windrows, for example, 
are thought to have a disadvantageously low ratio of 
composting material throughput to processing area 
square footage. While in vertical and closed 
reactors, compost material may typically be mounded 20-30 
feet high, technical difficulties have been  
 
experienced involving the adequacy of aeration, leading 
in some cases to the composting process becoming 
anaerobic. So called in-vessel composting operations, 
particularly those suitable for use in an enclosure 
building for sound and odor control, have been used 
with excellent results. A particularly advantageous 
system of this type, presently used and marketed by 
International Process Systems, Inc., a Wheelabrator 
Clean Water Company, and often referred to as the IPS 
Agitated Multi-Bay Composting System, employs automated 
agitators to thoroughly mix and aerate composting 
material in parallel bays. Starting at the discharge 
end of an open, elongate composting bay, the agitator 
moves through the bed of composting material toward 
the front, loading end of the bay. Typically, the 
agitator travels through each bay daily, mixing the 
material and rearwardly displacing it, i.e., moving it 
a given distance down the bay from the loading end 
toward the discharge end of the bay. Material 
typically is displaced a constant, fixed distance 
(often about 12 feet) down the bay with each pass, 
thus discharging finished material at the discharge end 
and creating space for a new load of organic
