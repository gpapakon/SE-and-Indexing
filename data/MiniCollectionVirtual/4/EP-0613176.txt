<ABSTRACT>
A process for simultaneously fabricating memory 
cells (2), transistors, and diodes (3) for protecting 

the tunnel oxide layer (9) of the cells, using the DPCC 
process wherein the first polysilicon layer (poly1, 10) 

is not removed from the transistor area, and the gate 
regions of the transistors are formed by shorted first 

(10) and second (13) polysilicon layers. To form the 
diodes, the poly1 layer is removed from the active areas 

in which the diodes are to be formed, using the same 
mask employed for shaping poly1; the interpoly 

dielectric layer (11) and the gate oxide layer are 
removed from the active areas of the diodes, using the 

same mask employed for removing the dielectric layer 
from the transistor area; a second polysilicon layer 

(poly2) is deposited directly on to the active areas of 
the diodes; and the poly2 doping ions penetrate the 

active areas to form N+ regions (6) which, together with 
the substrate (4), constitute the protection diodes. The 

diodes are thus formed prior to shaping poly2, and are 
connected to the control gates (12) of the cells by the 

second polycrystalline silicon layer strips forming the 
word lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
fabricating integrated devices including nonvolatile 
memories and transistors with tunnel oxide protection, according 
to claim 1. Though applicable to EPROM, EEPROM and flash-EEPROM 
memories, the present invention is particularly 
advantageous in the case of flash-EEPROMs to which special 
reference is made in the following description. Flash-EEPROM memories are Electrically Erasable 
Programmable Read Only Memories (EEPROMs) which combine 
the high density and low cost of EPROMs with the 
advantage of electrical erasability, and have recently 
become the most attractive of nonvolatile memories for 
their potential application in solid state disks for 
portable computers. Though various flash memory concepts have been 
developed, most manufacturers employ double-poly 
single-transistor cells with a structure closely 
resembling that of standard EPROM cells. Flash-EEPROM  
 
memory cells comprise an NMOS transistor with a 
polysilicon floating gate region capacitively coupled to 
a polysilicon or polycide (polysilicon and silicide) 
control gate region. The main difference between EEPROM 
and flash-EEPROM memories lies in the thickness of the 
oxide between the floating gate region and the 
substrate, which is thinner in the case of flash cells. The yield and reliability of flash memories are 
known to be closely related to the quality of the tunnel 
oxide, which quality not only depends on pre-oxidation 
cleaning and the oxidation process itself, but is also 
strongly affected by the post-oxidation process steps. Of all the process steps, the most critical are 
those which expose the wafer to radiation damage, 
namely, ion implantation, plasma etching, sputtering and 
plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition. Currently used flash-EEPROM memory processes 
present a large number of such steps following growth of 
the tunnel oxide. The model generally accepted for in-process 
radiation is the so-called "antenna effect" whereby 
charges are trapped in conductive layers and may result 
in a critical increase in the potential of the layers. To explain the phenomenon, it should be borne in 
mind that ion implantation and plasma processes involve 
the collision of charged particles (either electrons or 
ions) with the wafer surface, so that conductive  
 
polysilicon layers insulated from the silicon substrate 
may be charged by capturing the charged particles. If the polysilicon layer is not patterned, it acts 
as an electrostatic shield. In fact, the charge
