<ABSTRACT>
The pneumatically actuated core chuck described and shown has a compression ram (47) movable with respect to a sleeve (56) to force jaws (74) to expand outwardly for engagement with the interior of a core (C) of web material. The jaws (74) are pivotally mounted by means of links (69) extending from the compression ram (47). The ram (47) is mounted on a piston (31) movable in a cylinder (23) for actuation by the introduction of air under pressure into a chamber (36) behind the piston (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE: SINGLE ACTING CORE CHUCKBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to pneumatically or hydraulically actuated expanding chucks for supporting cores of web material during winding.Description of Related Art In order to reduce the time required for loading and unloading of winding and unwinding apparatus for rolls of web material such as paper, film, foil, textiles and the like, stub shafts or chucks have been provided for insertion into the ends of roll cores. The chuck is made to fit the inside diameter of the roll core and is expansible to grip the core.Various mechanisms have been employed in expanding mechanical chucks. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,584,714 shows a core plug which acts by squeezing of elastomeric material in response to torque applied to the core. This solution is not effective for dealing with high torque conditions. U.S. Patent No. 4,391,451 relates to an air- actuated chuck in which a tapered arbor pushes apart a plurality of wedges for engagement with the interior of a core. Such an arrangement can be subject to jamming.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The air-actuated expanding chuck of the present invention has a compression ram mounted for movement in the direction of the axis of a core. One or more, and preferably three, links connect the compression ram to outwardly movable jaws for engagement with the interior of a core upon axial advancement of the compression ram. The outer end of the ram is mounted on a cylindrical piston plate which moves as a piston to advance the compression ram upon introduction of air under pressure into a chamber behind the piston plate. Springs are provided to push the piston plate outwardly upon relief of the air pressure, retracting the compression ram and, through the links, withdrawing the jaws from engagement with the core. 

Although the invention is described as embodied in a pneumatically actuated chuck, it should be understood that the chuck can also be hydraulically actuated. The presently preferred embodiment of the invention includes three jaws, each connected by three pivotally mounted links to the compression ram. The jaws are equally arcuately spaced around the compression ram at 120Â° angles with respect to each other. Each jaw includes base jaw and a core jaw mounted on the base jaw. The links are mounted at each of their ends on dowel pins. The numbe of jaws and/or links for each jaw could be different, if desired, for some applications.The piston plate upon which the compression ram i mounted is movable within a cylinder

3. The core chuck of claim 1 wherein said jaws are movably positioned in openings through the sleeve.
4. The core chuck of claim 1 wherein the piston 0 is slidably mounted in a cylinder between a back plate and face plate.
5. The core chuck of claim 4 and including sprin means between the face plate and the piston for retraction 
5
 of the piston.
6. A fluid actuated core chuck having a pluralit of jaw members mounted for radially outward movement, each of the jaw members being pivotally mounted by means of one or more links on a generally cylindrical ram movable with respect to a generally tubular sleeve which sleeve has openings accomodating movement of the jaw members and which sleeve surrounds a forward portion of the ram, a rearward portion of the ram being affixed to a piston which is - slidably movable within a cylinder.
7. The core chuck of claim 6 wherein three jaw members are arranged at equally arcuately spaced locations around the ram. 


 8. The core chuck of claim 6 and including springs for retraction of the piston upon relief of pneumatic pressure.
9. The core chuck of claim 6 wherein the ram has an integral radial flange secured to a front face of the piston.
10. The core chuck of claim 6 wherein the ram has axially extending channels for receiving the jaw members and the openings in the sleeve are aligned with the axially extending channels.
11. The core chuck of claim 6 wherein each of the jaw members is pivotally connected to the ram by three links which are pivotable about pins.
