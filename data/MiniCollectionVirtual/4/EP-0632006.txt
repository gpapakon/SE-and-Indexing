<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
carbonylation of methanol or a reactive derivative thereof in the
presence of a halide promoter and a catalyst system comprising a
rhodium component and a bidentate phosphorus-sulphur ligand. The
present invention also relates to novel rhodium complexes.The preparation of rhodium (I) and rhodium (II) complexes with
mixed sulphur-nitrogen, -phosphorus and -arsenic ligands is
described by H A Hodali and I.M. Kittaneh in Dirasat:Nat.Sci. (Univ.
Jordan), 1983 10 47-55; CA., 1983 101 16218s.US Patent 4,670,570 describes a process for the production of
carboxylic acids from alcohols in the presence of a catalyst system
consisting essentially of rhodium metal atom, a phosphorus
containing ligand and a halogen-containing compound as promoter.
According to US 4,670,570 in the phosphorus containing ligand at
least one oxo (=O) oxygen atom is attached to a phosphorus atom or a
carbon atom to form a Z group and the P=O or C=O group in said Z
group is located at least one carbon atom removed and preferably
from 2-4 carbon atoms removed from the phosphorus atom of the
molecules represented by the formulas :
An especially preferred ligand is said to be
Ph2PCH2CH2P(=0)Ph2.International application publication number WO 92/04118
describes novel catalyst precursors having a phosphorus-nitrogen
chelated ligand attached to a metal, where said metal is most
preferably Rh, Ni or Co. The chelated ligand comprises a
substantially unreactive connecting backbone structure which links
two different dative centres or a donor with an anionic site.
According to WO 92/04118 the catalyst precursor has the general
formula:
 
wherein
M is a Group VIII B transition metal,Y,Y' are the same or different selected from CO, Cl-,
phosphines and olefinic hydrocarbons,R1-4, R6-12 are the same or different non-reactive
substituents,Q is selected from (CH2)n where n=1-5, a benzene ring
connected to P and X in the o-positions, an olefin connected
to P and X across the double bond, and (CH3)CH,X is P or As,R = a substituted aromatic ring,

whereA, B, C or D are selected from F, H, NO2 and alkyl and E
is endocyclic nitrogen or a C-CN group or isomers thereof, or
R = SiMe3 or TiCl2Cp where Me is methyl and Cp is
cyclopentadiene,R5 is aryl or alkyl, andS* is S, Se, O or N-R, R being as defined hereinabove.Amongst the exemplary ligands employed in WO92/04118 are said
to be those having the general formulae:-
The catalyst precursors described in WO92/04118 are active as
catalysts in the carbonylation
