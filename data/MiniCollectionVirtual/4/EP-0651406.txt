<ABSTRACT>
A carriage, which can be moved along X, Y and Z axes, of a multiple winding machine consists of an X-axis transverse carriage (20), a Y-axis carriage and a Z-axis carriage (40). Two Y-guide carriages (36-1,36-2; 36-1',36-2') and Z-guide carriages (46-1,46-2;46-1',46-2') respectively are in each case arranged on both sides for horizontal movement (40-Z,40-Z' - outlined by dashed lines), which carriages can be moved without play via Y- and Z-threaded spindles (34,34' and 44,44' respectively), which are arranged vertically and horizontally respectively, by means of spindle nuts (45,45'). The Y- and Z-threaded spindles (34,34' and 44,44' respectively) are arranged parallel to one another, located on the outside, on both sides of the winding machine and can be operated synchronously via toothed belts (32 and 42 respectively), which can each be moved along a transverse connection (31 or 41 respectively), and associated toothed-belt sprocket wheels (33,33' and 43,43' respectively).
