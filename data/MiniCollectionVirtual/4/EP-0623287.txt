<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to an edible 
microemulsion which includes an oil which cannot be 

formed into a microemulsion in a matrix of water and an 
alcohol selected from the group consisting of ethanol, 

propylene glycol, glycerine, sugar, sugar alcohol and 
mixtures thereof, a hydrophilic surfactant, a first water 

miscible alcohol emulsifying agent, like ethanol, propanol and 
propylene glycol, a second water 

immiscible alcohol emulsifying agent, like a C₈-C₁₄ 
primary alcohol, and water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
microemulsions of edible oils in a mixture of water, a 
water miscible alcohol, a water immiscible alcohol and a 
surfactant. Microemulsions are emulsions formed from water, 
oil and one or more emulsifying agents or surfactants 
wherein the individual emulsified particles of oil have a 
diameter of less than 1/4 the wavelength of white light, 
i.e., a particle size of about 100 to 600Å, although the 
size of the dispersed droplets permits light to pass 
through the microemulsion, the system is not necessarily 
transparent. It is generally referred to as translucent. 
Such systems remain dispersed and do not achieve 
equilibrium as macroemulsions do, by separating into the 
original, mutually insoluble liquid phases. With the aid 
of surfactants, it is possible to produce macroemulsions 
which remain dispersed for periods of time as long as a 
few days or possibly more. Ultimately, however, 
macroemulsions achieve equilibrium by separating into the 
mutually insoluble liquid phases. On the other hand, 
microemulsions exhibit stability which may be measured in 
years. Microemulsions are formed spontaneously, 
without the need for any energy input when the components 
thereof are uniformly admixed with each other. Although 
such microemulsions may be caused to be formed 
spontaneously, selection of the components therefore and 
amounts thereof are critical in order to first, obtain 
such microemulsion and, second, obtain such an emulsion 
which is stable for any reasonable period of time (S.E. 
Friburg, J. Dispersion Science & Technology, Vol. 6, 
No. 3, pp. 317-337, 1985). As reported in the Friburg  
 
reference, short chain alcohols, such as isopropanol, 
which are soluble in the aqueous phase, are not useful as 
cosurfactants in oil-in-water microemulsions. US-A-4146499 is directed 
to a method for dispersing a water-immiscible liquid in 
an aqueous phase as a microemulsion. The method includes 
the step of selecting a primary surfactant, which is an 
amphiphatic substance, dissolving the primary surfactant 
in the water-immiscible liquid, dispersing the solution 
of the water-immiscible liquid and the primary surfactant 
into the aqueous phase wherein the water-immiscible 
liquid is to be dispersed and providing a secondary 
surfactant in the aqueous phase which has a higher HLB 
than the primary surfactant. US-A-4146499 discloses a long list of 
primary surfactants, which can be selected from the group 
consisting of sorbitan esters of fatty acids having
