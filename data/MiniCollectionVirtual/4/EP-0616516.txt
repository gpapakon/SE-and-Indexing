<ABSTRACT>
An artificial vagina is described comprising a sheath (1) made from a flexible waterproof material. The sheath tapers from one end to the other, the wider end having a resealable opening (2) closed by a screw-threaded stopper (3). Projecting from the inner end of stopper (3) is an eye loop (4) connected to a hook (5) which swivels on wire loop (6) secured to tab (7). The tapered end of sheath (1) has a soft flexible undulating wall (8) and a bulbous portion (9) from which extends an annular membrane (10), the peripheral edge of which has a reinforced elastic rib (11). When assembled with the hook (5) connected to wire loop (6) a fluid chamber (12) is formed and filled with warm water (13) forming a chamber (14). Aperture (15) is formed in wall (8) to connect with bulbous portion (9) for the passage of the water (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an artificial vagina and more particularly to a male 
sexual gratification device. Due to the current worldwide risks of life threatening infections such as AIDS 
(Acquired Immunity Deficiency Syndrome) care must be exercised in sexual relationships 
by using protection such as condoms to prevent the spread of the infection. The 
alternatives to this are total abstinence from sexual intercourse, or self-gratification for 
prudent sexually unfulfilled mature males unable to attain otherwise satisfying 
monogamous relationships with consenting female partners. Reference is made to GB-A-0767389 which describes an apparatus for collecting 
semen for artificial insemination comprising a tapered sheath of flexible waterproof 
material which includes an internally heat-insulated wall. Although devices of this type are available, they have the disadvantage that they 
are not 100% reliable from the point of view of hygiene. An aim of the present invention is to overcome the above disadvantage and to 
provide a device which fulfills its purpose and is hygienically maintained. According to the present invention there is provided an artificial vagina 
comprising a tapered sheath of flexible waterproof material, characterised in that the 
larger end has a closure member, a wall and an opening resealable by the removable closure member, the 
closure member having releasable means to connect with the other end of the sheath to 
pull this into the sheath so that a fluid chamber is formed between the inwardly folded end 
and the wall of the other end of the sheath. Preferably, the closure member is a screw-threaded stopper, and the releasable 
means is a loop and swivel hook connection. Conveniently, the outer wall of the sheath has an annular membrane, the inner 
circumference of which has a ring shaped reinforced elastic rib. In a preferred construction the sheath is formed with a bulbous portion adjacent 
the annular membrane where it joins the sheath wall. An embodiment of the artificial vagina will now be described by way of example 
only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:  
 
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic longitudinal section of the 
artificial vagina according to the invention; Fig. 2 is a longitudinal section of the artificial 
vagina in its assembled position for use; and Fig. 3 is an end elevation of the artificial vagina 
shown in Fig. 2. The artificial vagina illustrated comprises a sheath 1 
made from a flexible waterproof material such as rubber or 
an elastomeric

<CLAIMS>
An artificial vagina comprising a tapered sheath (1) of flexible waterproof 
material, characterised in that the larger end has a closure member (3), a wall and an opening (2) resealable by the 

removable closure member (3), the closure member (3) having releasable means (5, 6) to 
connect with the other end (7) of the sheath (1) to pull this into the sheath (1) so that a 

fluid chamber (12) is formed between the narrow inwardly folded end and the wall of the 
other larger end of the sheath (1). 
An artificial vagina as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the closure 
member (3) is a screw-threaded stopper, and the releasable means is a loop (4) and swivel 

hook connection (5).
