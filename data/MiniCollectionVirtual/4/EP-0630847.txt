<ABSTRACT>
This invention consists of an emergency apparatus 
intended for moving the cage of a lift to one of 

the two nearest landings. This apparatus is easy to 
be installed and can be put into operation by means 

of the control board and sensors of the already 
existing system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is an 
emergency apparatus intended to move the cage of 
the lift to one of the two nearest landings in 
case of a failure of the electric power supply. At present, systems which can carry out the  
 
emergency manoeuvre are already available. Such 
systems, in case of blackout, come into operation 
switching the control of the motors to a board and 
simplified and essential sensor systems added to 
the existing system, which are necessary to the 
execution of the manoeuvre. The labour and 
materials needed for the transformation of the 
system are very costly, and such as to limit the 
diffusion of the system. The object of this invention is to use the system 
of The control board and relative sensors 
previously installed and utilised in conditions of 
normal electric power supply to allow to perform 
all the operations required for the emergency in 
case of blackout. The installation of the apparatus 
can be accomplished by means of simple connections 
between the apparatus itself, the control board of 
the existing system and the electrical network. Its 
capacity of making use both of the existing control 
board and sensor system, makes it possible to avoid 
complicated and costly installations along the lift 
shaft, also permitting a remarkable saving in costs 
and materials. Should the electricity supply fail while the cage 
is moving, the apparatus comes into operation,  
 
supplies the electric control board and the 
relative sensors thereof, and, making use of the 
data concerning the functioning of the cage 
previously stored therein, sends the necessary 
drive to the control board, for properly 
controlling the emergency manoeuvre. Once all the stage of the emergency manoeuvre 
have been accomplished, the apparatus stops 
working, leaving the lift in the "out of order" 
condition until the electric power supply is back. The invention will be now described in detail 
with reference to the annexed drawings, wherein 
figure 1 shows the block diagram of the parts 
comprised in the emergency apparatus, and figure 2 
shows the flow diagram of the functions, referred 
to the various situations wherein the blackout can 
occur. The emergency apparatus for lifts of the 
invention, comprises three principal units: 
1) Power module 2) Interface module 3) Battery unit (which, for better convenience, 
has been drawn inside the power module.) The power module includes a switch/inverter  
 
composed of a remote control switch, with the 
relative control circuits usually on
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An emergency apparatus to move the cage of a 
lift to one of the two nearest floors in case of 

electric power blackout, easy to be installed and 
working preferably employing the control board and 

sensors of the existing system by means of simple 
connections between the apparatus itself, the 

control board of the existing system and the 
electrical network. 
The emergency apparatus for lifts of claim 1, 
comprising: a power module, an interface module and 

a battery unit, the power module comprising a 
switch/inverter composed of a remote control switch 

and relative control circuits usually in the 
"network" position, which switches the apparatus to 

the "inverter" position when the emergency 
manoeuvre starts. 
The emergency apparatus for lifts of claim 1, 
wherein said interface module, by means of input 

sensors, continuously stores the data existing on 
the control board, such as the position of the cage 

and the relative functions. 
The emergency apparatus for lifts of claim 1 
wherein the battery unit preferably consists of six 

sealed lead-acid batteries, preferably of 
 

12V/6.5Ah, that are necessary to supply the whole 
apparatus.
