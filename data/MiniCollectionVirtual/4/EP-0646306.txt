<ABSTRACT>
A digital compressed video signal transmission system includes a transport processor for segmenting (105, 115) compressed data into transport cells for transmission. Particular portions of the compressed data are formatted (110, 120, 125) into further transport cells, which further transport cells are interspersed with normally occurring transport cells. The further transport cells include redundant video signal data which may be utilized to resynchronize a compressed video signal decoder after loss or corruption of transmitted data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for segmenting compressed video data into cells or
packets for transmission in a manner to allow a receiver to
rapidly recover from occurrences of missing data or corrupted
data.The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) are
establishing a standard for transmission and storage of video data
primarily for use by computers. This proposed standard is
detailed in the document "International Organization for
Standardization", ISO-IEC JT(1/SC2/WG1), Coding of Moving
Pictures and Associated Audio, MPEG 90/176 Rev.2, Dec. 18, 1990.
The signal protocol is hierarchical or layered. Frames of video
data are compressed in groups of, for example, 15 frames.
Respective frames are either intraframe encoded (I frames),
forward predictive interframe encoded (P frames) or
forward/backward predictive interframe encoded (B frames).
Each frame is divided into slices corresponding to horizontal image
bands (e.g., 16 line stripes). The slices are segmented into
macroblocks consisting of matrices of 16 by 16 pixels. The
macroblocks are encoded in four 8 by 8 blocks of luminance
values, and two 8 by 8 blocks of chrominance values (U and V
signal components). Each of the 8 by 8 chrominance blocks are
derived by horizontally and vertically subsampling component
chrominance values representing respective 16 by 16
macroblocks. The signal protocol calls for a sequence layer for
identifying the overall signal type, which layer includes a
sequence start code and header information identifying, for
example, picture size, pixel aspect ratio, picture rate, bit rate,
buffer size, a number of flag bits, etc. Following the sequence
layer is a group of pictures, GOP header which include a start code,
a time code, a closed GOP flag, a broken link flag and extension
data. The next layer includes a picture start code and picture
header. The picture (PICT) header includes a temporal 
reference, picture coding type (I, P, B), buffer fullness, vector and
pixel precision flags, variable length code identifiers and extension
data. A slice start code follows the picture layer and includes a
start code and a header identifying the slice. Following the slice
layer is the macroblock layer which includes a start code and
header data. The macroblock header data includes identifying
indicia, quantizing information, type of encoding etc. The
macroblock layer also includes motion vectors which are common
to the six blocks of data in each macroblock, and encoded block
data on a block by block basis. The
