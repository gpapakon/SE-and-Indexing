<ABSTRACT>
Running gear for railway vehicles, which, by virtue of the particular arrangement of the damping components, improves damping, permits high travel speeds and ensures that bends can be travelled through safely. This object is achieved by means of the arrangement of the vertical and horizontal shock absorbers in such a way that as a result of the horizontal shock absorber force a rotational deflection of the axle bearing housing is produced, which rotational deflection is in turn additionally damped by the vertical shock absorber, the longitudinal movements of the wheel sets being simultaneously damped by the horizontal shock absorber and the vertical shock absorber and this also applying to a lesser degree to the transverse movements of the wheel sets. The vertical shock absorber is included in the damping characteristic of the horizontal shock absorber. By changing the attachment point of the horizontal shock absorber and thus by changing the points of intersection of the median lines of the shock absorbers and the median line of the axle bearing housing in the vertical and horizontal planes by means of an attachment bracket arranged in a defined manner it is possible to vary the damping ratio of the shock absorbers. The invention is suitable in particular for sets of running gear which are to be used for high speed transport.

<CLAIMS>
Running gear for rail vehicles, having a
shock-absorber arrangement for the axle coil-spring

suspension, the bogie frame or vehicle frame being
supported via spring elements on the axle boxes of the

wheel set, which are guided with longitudinal and
transverse play, characterized in that an approximately

perpendicularly disposed vertical shock absorber (3) is
arranged between axle centre (1) and an axle coil-spring

centre (2), and a horizontal shock absorber (8), the
action-of-force line (12) of which forms an angle (α)

with the vehicle longitudinal direction and an angle (β)
with the horizontal, is arranged between fastening

brackets (5), which lie in the region of the axle-journal
transverse centres, and frame (7) of the bogie or

vehicle, the action-of-force line (12) of the horizontal
shock absorber (8) intersecting the perpendicular axle

centre (1) at a distance (c) below the horizontal axle
centre (13), the angles (α and β) being adjustable at the

fastening bracket (5), which is arranged in a defined
manner at the axle box (6).
