<DESCRIPTION>
 PLATINUM PLATING HATH ELECTROLYTEThis invention concerns platinum plating bath electrolytes.Precious metals are used as films on surfaces for a variety of reasons. In the jewellery trade, precious metals, including platinum, are used to improve the appearance of an article and to create special effects. Platinum may be used as a film to protect metals and other materials from corrosion, such as the coating of bursting discs. Platinum films are also used to provide conducting paths in electrical circuits. Platinum films can have 

more than one use in a particular application, such as with platinised titanium electrodes, where the platinum film acts as an electrical conductor and also protects the titanium, allowing the electrodes to be used in corrosive environments. Platinised surfaces may also have a catalytic function, for example in the reduction of the hydrogen overpotential of anodes. A further application of platinum films is where they are reacted with components of the substrate or with additional materials to create reaction products, such as in the coating of turbine blades and subsequent treatment to form the erosion- and corrosion-resistant platinum aluminide. Platinum alloy films may also be formed and treated in this way.Electroplated films find many other applications, for example the metallurgical and biological fields.Conventionally, platinum and platinum alloy films may be electro-deposited from a number of aqueous systems which are optimised for the particular application. Such processes are based on materials such as diamminedinitroplatinute(II) (platinum 'P' salt), alkali metal hexa- hydroxyplatinates(IV), hydrogen hexachloroplatinate(IV) and hydrogen dinitrosulphatoplatinate(II) (DNS), and present a variety of problems in use.Difficulties of control, low rates of deposition, low efficiency, extremes of pH (acidity and alkalinity), precipitation of undesirable substances, loss of conductivity, and highly stressed films especially when the film thickness exceeds 5 microns, are all problems associated with the conventional processes. Because of these factors, each system is normally optimised for 

a small number of specific applications, and many product variants have to be marketed. Extensive use of additives in the electrolytes, such as conducting salts, buffers, brighteners and materials to improve the throwing power can compound the COΠUΌI difficulties. The addition of replenishers may alter the balance of the species present in the electrolytes leading to changes in the nature
