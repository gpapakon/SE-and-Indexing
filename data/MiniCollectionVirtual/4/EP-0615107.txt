<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns a sectional radiator consisting of 
two tubes, one (3) fitted inside the other (2), thereby forming an 

annular air space (4) between the same sealed by two annular 
bottoms (4a); said air space communicating by means of holes (2a) 

with two external manifolds (1) fixed respectively at the top 
and the bottom of the exterior tube (2) and consisting of a 

coupling having a horizontal axis threaded internally.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a sectional radiator having a pair 
of concentric tubes and utilizing the internal and external 
walls of the annular air space between the pair of 
concentric tubes as the radiating surface: two couplings 
being fixed laterally at the bottom and at the top of the 
external tube characterized in that the internal pipe of 
the couplings communicates with the above air space by 
means of a hole on the wall of the couplings and by means 
of a corresponding hole on the wall of the external tube of 
the above pair of concentric tubes. Each coupling being 
threaded internally in order to allow connection by means 
of standard nipples to the coupling of the adjacent module 
making it possible to construct a radiator in any size 
required. Existing steel sectional radiators consist of identical 
tubular elements welded together having hot water 
circulating in each tubular element. In the case of this type of conventional radiator the 
quantity of heat exchanged is limited in that as the  
 
surface area of exchange increases, for example by 
increasing the diameter and the number of the tubes, so 
will the volume of water in the same increase thereby 
increasing the heat inertia of the radiator and 
consequently the consumption of power. The high volume of water makes it impossible to utilize 
these radiators in low temperature systems using 
alternative forms of power generation. The purpose of this invention is to resolve the above 
mentioned problems. The radiator as per the claim, consists of a sectional 
radiator having concentric tubes characterized by a large 
surface area of heat exchange and a low volume of water. The model according to the invention consists of two 
radiating tubes, one fitted inside the other and connected 
to the manifolds so that the heating water flows into the 
air space; the air strikes the external wall of the large 
diameter tube and the internal wall of the small diameter 
tube. The manifolds are fixed to the radiating tubes and join, by 
means of threaded nipples, each radiator element to the 
adjacent element thereby making it possible to construct 
sectional radiators of any capacity. Compared with a conventional radiator of the same size, the 
radiator according to the invention contains 47% less water 
and increases the surface area of heat exchange by 54%.  For major clarity, the description continues with reference 
to the enclosed drawings which are intended for purposes of 
illustration and not in a limiting sense whereby:
