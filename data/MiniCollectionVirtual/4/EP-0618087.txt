<ABSTRACT>
A plate for forming a housing member for a ring binder (10) which is 
provided with at least one rib (38) positioned longitudinally on the 

plate (40) along each side thereof, wherein said ribs (38) are provided 
along the substantial length of each side of the housing member plate 

(36).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ring binders to hold paper and 
the like for loose-leaf binders, files, folders and the like. During the manufacture of prior art ring binders, a 
problem has been ascertained, namely that the upturned sides of the 
housing member of the ring binder have a tendency to spring back 
during formation. As a result, the sides of the housing member are 
not formed at the correct angle, and carrier plates positioned in the 
housing member can drop out. GB-A-2 209 500 discloses a ring binder mechanism for 
a loose-leaf binder with ring elements secured to the carrier rails 
within a cover rail in which the cover rail is provided with a 
longitudinal indentation which provides increased strength and 
rigidity to the mechanism. It is suggested that there could be two or 
more indentations. In particular, there could be two parallel 
indentations located symmetrically on either side of the cover rail, 
and the shape and position of each indentation should be chosen to 
give the desired stiffening effect. It is an object of this invention to overcome the above 
problem, and/or to provide a useful alternative. In accordance with the invention, there is provided a 
plate for forming a housing member for supporting a pivotable lower 
structure in a ring binder, wherein the plate is provided with at least 
one rib positioned along each lateral side thereof, and wherein when  
 
the plate is formed into the housing member, the ribs are below the 
part where the housing member supports the pivotable lower 
structure. Such an arrangement prevents any spring back of the 
sides of the housing member plate during forming of the housing 
member. Suitably the ribs are provided along the substantial 
length of each lateral side of the plate. Such ribs cause the sides of the housing member to be 
exactly normal to the rest of the housing member, and accordingly 
carrier rails inserted into the housing member will not tend to drop 
out. Preferably at least one indentation is provided adjacent 
each lateral side of the plate. Such indentations in co-operation with sides normal to 
the rest of the housing member totally prevent carrier rails of a ring 
binder from dropping out of the housing member during assembly. Advantageously the indentations project from the plate 
in the opposite direction to that of the ribs. The invention will now be described by way of 
example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:

<CLAIMS>
A plate (40) for forming a housing member (24) for 
supporting a pivotable lower structure (30) in a ring binder 

(10), wherein the plate (40) is provided with at least one rib 
(38) positioned along each lateral side thereof, characterized 

in that when the plate (40) is formed into the housing member 
(24), the ribs (38) are below the part where the housing 

member (24) supports the pivotable lower structure (30). 
A plate (40) as claimed in Claim 1 further characterized in 
that the ribs (38) are provided along the substantial length of 

each lateral side of the plate (40). 
A plate (40) as claimed in either Claim 1 or 2 further 
characterized in that at least one indentation (42) is provided 

adjacent each lateral side of the plate (40). 
A plate (40) as claimed in Claim 3 further characterized in 
that the indentations (42) project from the plate (40) in the 

opposite direction to that of the ribs (38). 
A ring binder (10) formed using a plate (40) as claimed in 
any preceding claim.
