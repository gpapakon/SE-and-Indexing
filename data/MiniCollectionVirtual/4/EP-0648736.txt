<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of secondary or tertiary amines by reaction of higher olefins with carbon monoxide, hydrogen and a primary or secondary amine. The reaction takes place in the presence of a mixture of rhodium and ruthenium compounds, which are homogeneously dissolved in the reaction mixture, as catalyst.

A process for the preparation of secondary or 

tertiary amine from a terminal olefin having at 
least 6 carbon atoms in the molecule, carbon 

monoxide, hydrogen and primary or secondary amines 
at elevated temperature under increased pressure in 

the presence of a mixture of rhodium compounds and 
ruthenium compounds, dissolved homogeneously in the 

reaction mixture, as the catalyst, which comprises 
employing rhodium and ruthenium in a molar ratio of 

1:2 to 1:50, the rhodium concentration being 2 to 
15 ppm by weight based on the olefin. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the rhodium 
concentration, based on the olefin, is 6 to 12, in 

particular 8 to 10 ppm by weight. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 3 to 
10, in particular 4 to 15 mol of ruthenium are 

employed per mole of rhodium. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
3, wherein the reaction is carried out in the 

presence of a solvent. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, wherein a 
monoalcohol having 1 to 3 or dialcohol having 3 to 

6 carbon atoms in the molecule is used as the 
solvent. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5, wherein the reaction is carried out at 100 to 

160°, in particular 110 to 150° and preferably 120 
to 140°C, under pressures of 4 to 20, in particular 

8 to 18 and preferably 10 to 16 MPa. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
6, wherein the olefin is straight-chain or mono- or  

 
polybranched and contains 6 to 24, preferably 8 to 

20 carbon atoms in the molecule. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
7, wherein the amine corresponds to the formula 

R
1
R
2
NH, in which R
1
 and R
2
 are identical or different 
and are hydrogen or alkyl radicals having 1 to 4 

carbon atoms, with the proviso that R
1
 and R
2
 are not 
simultaneously hydrogen. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
8, wherein 1 to 3, in particular 1 to 2, preferably 

1 to 1.5 mol of primary or secondary amine are 
employed per mole of olefin.
