<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a charging
device for charging (or discharging) a member to be
charged or discharged, more particularly to a contact
type charging device (contact charging device or
direct charging device) having a charging member
contacted to the member to be charged and supplied
with a voltage in use. The present invention also
relates to a process cartridge and an image forming
apparatus such as a copying machine or printer of an
electrophotographic type or electrostatic recording
type in which a charging member supplied with a
voltage is contacted to an image bearing member to
charge or discharge the image bearing member in an
image forming process.The description will be made, taking an image
forming apparatus as an example, for convenience of
explanation.Heretofore, in an image forming apparatus
of an electrophotographic type or electrostatic
recording type, a corona charger has been widely
used to charge the image bearing member in the form
of an electrophotographic photosensitive member or
an electrostatic recording dielectric member or the 
like.Recently, however, from the standpoint of the
advantages of the low ozone production or low electric
power consumption or the like, the contact charging
device having a charging member contacted to the
member to be charged and supplied with a voltage, has
been put into practice. Particularly, a roller type-charging
device is preferably used because of the
advantage of the stability.In the contact type charging device of the
roller charging type, an electroconductive elastic
roller (charging member) is press-contacted to the
member to be charged and is supplied with a voltage to
charge it.More particularly, the charging is effected
by the electric discharge from the charging member
to the member to be charged, and therefore, the
charging action starts with a voltage at a threshold
level.For example, when the charging roller is
press-contacted to an OPC photosensitive member
having a thickness of 25 µm (member to be charged),
the surface potential of the photosensitive member
starts to increase when a voltage not less than
approx. 640 V is applied to the charging roller.
Subsequently, the surface potential of the
photosensitive member increases linearly with an 
inclination I relative to the applied voltage.
Hereinafter, the threshold voltage is defined as a
charge starting voltage Vth.Thus, in order to obtain a surface potential
Vd of the photosensitive member required for the
electrophotographic process, the DC voltage not less
than Vd
