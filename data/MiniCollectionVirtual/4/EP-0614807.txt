<ABSTRACT>
An improved reaction wheel assembly (10) is provided whereby a reaction 
wheel assembly contains a safing mechanism (70) for securing the assembly. A rotor 

shaft assembly and bearings (34, 64) are provided whereby a reaction wheel assembly 
selectively may be either safe or operational, and the safing assembly provides for 

application of stabilizing force longitudinally along the axis of rotation of a rotor shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention comprises a reaction wheel assembly
according to the preamble of claim 1
used to provide
reaction torque in momentum stabilization of vehicles. In particular, the present
invention comprises an improved reaction wheel assembly in which a rotor safing
mechanism is employed. In the present invention, the rotor safing mechanism is used to
isolate the rotor bearings from deflective forces that are incident upon the reaction wheel
assembly during periods of high vehicular stress. In the case of a satellite, for example,
the present invention is used in safing the rotor mechanism during launch of the satellite,
a time during which damaging forces are brought to bear upon the relatively delicate
components of the reaction wheel assembly.During launch of a satellite, forces (or "loads") are generated by the reaction
forces of a high inertia rotor structure exposed to vibration environments during payload
launch and ascent. Effective bearing isolation using the present invention facilitates the
use of smaller bearing systems. Further, savings in power consumption may be brought
about by use of the present invention. Further, the present invention provides
advantages as to size, cost and mass of the components in a reaction wheel assembly.Reaction wheel assemblies of the type disclosed in the present invention
include a rotor which acts like an axle positioned between two support points. The
support points in the present invention are comprised of bearings, and the rotor is
allowed to spin within bearings located at either end of the rotor.Momentum stabilization is achieved in most reaction wheel assemblies by the
use of a rotor web structure, which proceeds laterally and perpendicular to the rotor
itself, with a relatively large mass at the distal end of the rotor assembly. During
operation of reaction wheel assemblies, the forces acting upon the bearings are generated
by bearing preload forces, misalignment forces, and residual rotor imbalances. Further,
some undesirable forces that occur during operation may be caused by the housing
precessional rate.In the design of reaction wheel assemblies, the mass of the structural
components is a critical factor. Since reaction wheel assemblies typically are used in
conjunction with spacecraft, satellites, aircraft, or other vehicles that are in motion, the
mass of the assembly is very important. Of course, the performance of a flight vehicle is
greatly affected by gravity, and as in all space or satellite components, the weight of the 
component
