<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an envelope for holding 
transparencies used in overhead projectors. 
Specifically, the envelopes include at least one opaque 
flap attached to the envelope using an adhesive tape 
having increased flexibility. Business presentations, lectures and the like often 
are augmented by the use of imaged transparencies, which 
are exhibited to the viewers on a screen by means of an 
overhead projector (OHP). The individual transparencies 
are delicate, and easily damaged in storage or transit. 
Various types of covers, folders and envelopes have been 
provided in order to enable professional presentations, 
as well as interim protection of the transparencies. U.S. Patent No. 3,875,693 discloses the framing of a 
transparency in a frame made from carton, paperboard and 
the like. The frame is meant to mask the illumination 
gaps formed about the peripheral of the transparency 
proper. The frame can also be used to make notes or 
other memoranda needed by the lecturer which remain 
unseen by the audience. However, these frames are bulky 
and will not fit into standard size files, binders and 
shelves, being therefore difficult to store and 
transport. Also, they are not easily removable without 
destruction of the frame and attendant damage to the 
transparency. Finally, the frames are not convenient to 
attach to transparencies as each one must be carefully 
positioned and attached by hand. Swedish Patent No. 382,266 discloses an 
envelope which is a plastic sheet pocket having punched 
holes along one side, and being open at the top for 
insertion of the transparency to be presented. These 
envelopes are removable, simple to handle, store and  
 
transport as the outer dimensions are those of standard 
binders or files. Moreover, the transparency is 
protected by the envelope and at the presentation, notes 
can be made on the envelope. The disadvantage of this envelope is that peripheral 
illumination is not masked and the lecturer cannot make 
written notes on the envelopes without having these notes 
being shown on the screen as well. The punched holes 
also show an outline on the screen. Therefore, this 
envelope does not yield a presentation having an 
extremely professional appearance. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,253,358; 3,264,936; 3,438,702; 
3,438,703; 3,524,703; 3,536,393; 3,537792; 3,544,211; 
3,600,079; and Swedish Patent SE-B-346,166 
describe further examples of covers or envelopes for OHP 
transparencies. The covers and envelopes disclosed in 
these publications are complicated

<CLAIMS>
An envelope for transparencies for overhead projectors, said 
envelope comprising a substantially rectangular pocket of transparent 

sheet material, said pocket having two longitudinal side edges 
connected by shorter side edges, said pocket being open at least along 

one side edge for insertion of a transparency, at least one opaque 
flap, said flap being attached in a foldable manner along one of said 

side edges by means of a flexible adhesive tape forming an operable hinge, said flap having a 
folded position in which it does not extend beyond the side edge of 

the pocket and an unfolded or open position in which it extends beyond the 
side edge of the pocket characterised in that said tape comprises a 

flexible polyester backing having a thickness of less than 
15 micrometers, and attached on one surface thereof, and an adhesive 

layer, wherein said tape has a flexibility measurement of not more 
than 2.5 grams when measured in accordance with the Flexibility Test Measurement set out in the description, and a 180Â° peel adhesion of at least 100 grams per 

centimeter, said flap being capable of remaining in the unfolded 
position on the stage of an overhead projector 3M model 2150 with the adhesive layer 

exposed to the stage and with adhesive transfer to said stage in a maximum of one in 
three samples of said envelope at the operating 

temperature of the overhead projector when the flap and tape are 
pulled across the stage at 30.5 cm/minute in a direction such that the flap is forced to open further to expose the adhesive, said open hinge having been 

pressed for one minute on the stage by a 3,8 cm diameter 100 gm weight centered on the open hinge. 
An envelope according to claim 1 wherein 
said polyester backing is poly(ethylene terephthalate), 

said backing having a thickness of from 5 micrometers to 
10 micrometers. 
An envelope according to claim 1 
wherein said tape adhesive is rubber resin adhesive selected 

from the group consisting of natural rubber, styrene-butadiene 
and styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymers and 

hydrogenated copolymers thereof, polybutadiene, 
polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, butyl rubbers, 

polychloroprene, ethylene-propylene copolymer rubbers, 
ethylene-propene-diene rubbers, and mixtures thereof.  

 
An envelope according to claim 3 
wherein said adhesive is a tackified styrene-butadiene-styrene 

copolymer. 
An envelope according to claim 1 
wherein said adhesive is an acrylic adhesive comprising 

isooctyl acrylate and acrylic acid.  
 
An adhesive tape according to claim 1 wherein 
said tape has a thickness less an 90 micrometers, and 

wherein said backing has a thickness of 5 to 15 micrometers. 
An adhesive tape according to claim 1 wherein 
said tape has a thickness less than 25 micrometers, and 

wherein said backing has a thickness of 5 to 10 micrometers.
