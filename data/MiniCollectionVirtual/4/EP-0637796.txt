<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a two-way transmitting 
apparatus which transmits display data and audio signal 

from an audio reproducing device to a remote controller and 
headphones with display by wireless transmitting, and 

transmits control signals to the audio reproducing apparatus 
according to one of the operation of a plurality of 

operation unit established on the remote controller and the 
headphones. The control data is divided into a 

predetermined number of blocks, the discrimination 
code "d" is inserted between respective blocks to generate 

the data sequence, and the data length per unit block is set 
to most approximate to the value of square root of the 

control data length. Thereby, it is possible to transmit 
efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data transmission
apparatus and is suitably applied to a portable compact disc
player which can be controlled by a wireless remote
commander.Heretofore, in the portable type compact disc player,
there have been some apparatuses which have a miniaturized
whole shape and can be driven by a battery.More specifically, by miniaturizing the whole shape and
driving the apparatus by a battery, this type of compact
disc player can be easily portable and the user can appreciate
music at any desired place.Hereupon, in this type of compact disc player, if the
compact disc player body and the control unit are formed
separately and the audio signal can be reproduced at the
compact disc player body while simultaneously the reproduced
audio signal can be wireless transmitted to the control
unit, the user can appreciate music in a state where the
compact disc player body is put in a bag and the usability
of this type of compact disc player can be improved.If the wireless remote commander function is operated
in the control unit, the operation of a compact disc player
body can be controlled in a state where the compact disc
player body is put in a bag.Furthermore, if a display unit is formed in the control
unit and the operation of the compact disc player body is 
confirmed through this display unit, the usability can be
further improved.Therefore, it is necessary that the compact disc player
body wireless transmits audio signals and display data to
the control unit, and also the control unit wireless
transmits the control data for switching the operation to
the compact disc player body.In the portable compact disc player of this type, it is
also necessary to downsize the shape and size of the control
unit.Furthermore, it is necessary for the control unit to
have a lowered operating voltage and a reduced consumption
of the power source.However, if the operating voltage is lowered, it
becomes essential to decrease the operating speed in the
control unit, such that it takes time for receiving process
of the display data outputted from the compact disc player
body.On the other hand, it is necessary that in this control
unit, the operation of the operation key is detected at a
predetermined cycle, and depending upon the detected result
thereof, the control data must be outputted to the compact
disc player body.Thus, if the operating voltage of the control unit is
lowered, the key scanning cycle of the operation key becomes
longer for the time required for receiving process of the
display
