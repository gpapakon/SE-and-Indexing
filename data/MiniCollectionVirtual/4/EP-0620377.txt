<ABSTRACT>
A solenoid operated hydraulic valve 10, 12 for supplying a 
regulated hydraulic pressure to a load in dependence upon an 

electrical demand signal applied to the valve. The valve has 
means 18 for sensing the temperature of the hydraulic fluid 

flowing through the valve and means 14 for determining the 
current applied to the valve solenoid 12 in dependence upon both 

the demand signal from a sensor 16 and the sensed temperature 
such that the regulated pressure supplied to the load is 

dependent only on the demand signal and is substantially 
independent of the temperature of the hydraulic fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure regulating 
solenoid operated hydraulic valve. In certain applications, for example for actuation of a 
clutch in an agricultural or industrial tractor, a hydraulic 
valve is required that can deliver a regulated pressure in 
response to an applied electrical control signal. For this 
purpose, hydraulic valves are known that have a valve spool 
slidably mounted within a housing. The spool has lands that 
cooperate with ports in the housing to vary the flow between a 
pressure supply line, a line leading to the load to be supplied 
and a return line to a reservoir or tank. One end of the spool is 
acted upon by the pressure in a control chamber and the other is 
acted upon in the opposite direction by a spring. The position of 
the spool in the housing can therefore be set by varying the 
pressure in the control chamber and this in return regulates the 
pressure supplied to the load. The control chamber of the spool valve is permanently 
connected to a pressure source and is also connected to the 
return line by way of a solenoid operated valve. The latter valve 
comprises a ball urged against a valve seat by the armature of a 
control solenoid of the spool valve. The greater the current 
flowing through the solenoid, the greater is the force applied by 
the armature to urge the ball against its seat and therefore the 
greater is the pressure in the control chamber. Thus force 
exerted by the solenoid determines the pressure in the control 
chamber, this in turn determines the position of the valve spool 
in the housing and therefore the pressure of the hydraulic fluid 
supplied to the load. The present invention provides a solenoid operated hydraulic 
valve for supplying a regulated hydraulic pressure to a load in 
dependence upon an electrical demand signal applied to the valve, 
the valve having means for sensing the temperature of the  
 
hydraulic fluid flowing through the valve and means for 
determining the current applied to the valve solenoid in 
dependence upon both the demand signal and the sensed temperature 
such that the regulated pressure supplied to the load is 
dependent only on the demand signal and is substantially 
independent of the temperature of the hydraulic fluid. The invention is based on the discovery that, contrary to 
normal expectations, the pressure supplied to the load with 
certain valve designs is dependent upon the temperature of the 
hydraulic fluid flowing through the valve. Such dependency can be 
avoided by providing
