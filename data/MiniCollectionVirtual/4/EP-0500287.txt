<ABSTRACT>
A catalyzer control apparatus for purifying exhaust 
gas from an internal combustion engine has an electrically 

heated catalyzer (2) that is heated by a battery (15) which 
battery is isolated from the conventionally provided engine 

battery (4). The temperature of the catalyzer (2) is 
detected by a sensor (6) and a control circuit (12) located 

with an engine control unit (5) selectively applies power 
to heat the catalyzer (2). The catalyzer (2) is arranged 

to be pre-heated prior to engine start and by isolating the 
battery for heating the catalyzer from the normally 

provided engine battery so, because the catalyzer (2) takes 
a great power, engine starting is enhanced by virtue of 

having separate batteries (15, 4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalyzer apparatus for 
purifying emission gas of an automobile engine. A known catalyzer control apparatus, as disclosed in 
SAE, Technical Paper, Series 900503 (1990), pages 61 to 70 
for purifying exhaust gas from an internal combustion 
engine has a converter with a resistor-type metal substrate 
which is heated to improve cold start emission 
characteristics. Such electrically heated monoliths have 
been designed to reach catalytic working temperatures of 
about 350°C in less than thirty seconds using the 
conventional 12V electrical system. Thus, means are 
provided for applying a heating current to the catalyzer 
and temperature detection means are provided for detecting 
the temperature of the catalyzer so as to control the heat 
applying means so that the temperature of the catalyzer is 
raised toward a desired working temperature. Because the amount of energy required to heat the 
catalyzer is approximately 4.7Kw, a considerable strain is 
placed upon the conventional battery, resulting in battery 
drain. Because it is desired to heat the catalyzer prior 
to starting the engine so that it is closer to its working 
temperature at the time of engine start to thereby minimize 
pollution, so the drain on the battery in heating the 
catalyzer often results in the battery charging capacity 
dropping so that the engine cannot be started by its 
normally provided starter motor. This invention seeks to overcome the foregoing 
difficulty.  
 According to this invention there is provided a 
catalyzer control apparatus for purifying exhaust gas from 
an internal combustion engine having a power supply 
comprises catalyzer means, heat applying means for applying 
a heating current to said catalyzer means, and temperature 
detection means for detecting the temperature of the said 
catalyzer means, said heat applying means including control 
means for controlling the heating current to be supplied to 
the said catalyzer means so as to raise the temperature of 
the said catalyzer means toward a desired temperature using 
the signals from the said temperature detection means, a 
further power supply being provided for supplying current 
to the said catalyser means, which further power supply is 
independent of the power supply provided for the engine. Preferably, the further power supply for supplying 
current to said catalyzer means is set to a voltage higher 
than the power supply provided for the engine. Advantageously, said control means includes means for 
activating said heat
