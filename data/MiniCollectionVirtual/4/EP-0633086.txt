<ABSTRACT>
The open end of the nozzle 42 is positioned close 
to and facing the surface of the metal base 20 on the side 

were the portion of the semiconductor ingot is to be cut off. 
An electromagnetic valve 46 is provided in the passage 

through which compressed air is supplied to the nozzle 42. 

The initial position of the blade 19 is detected by the 
detector 50U and the counter 52 measures the distance the 

blade 19 travels downward from the detected position and then 
the comparator 56 detects the point at which the measured 

value matches the value set on the numeric value setting 
device 54. The electromagnetic valve 46 is opened to emit 

compressed air from the nozzle 42 after this detection, until 
the detection of the lower limit position of the blade 19 by 

the detector 50D. This compressed air travels along in the 
direction of the rotation of the metal base 20 to enter the 

notch of the partially cut portion of the semiconductor ingot 
10 made by the inner circumference cutting edge 22 and to 

consequently blow out the liquid coolant present between the 
metal base 20 and the semiconductor ingot 10.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inner diameter
saw slicing machine used for cutting semiconductor ingots.The semiconductor ingot 10 has a cone-shaped tail
portion 10b and a cone-shaped head portion 10c formed on the
ends of the cylindrical body portion 10a. The semiconductor
ingot 10 as shown in Fig. 5B is transported in the direction
of its axis over the feed rollers 12 and 14 which are
arranged in a V formation. Then it is pressed down and
secured by the clamper 16 at the position shown in Fig. 5A.In the rotor 18, the outer circumference portion of
the blade 19 is held in the tension head 24. In the blade 19,
an inner circumference cutting edge 22 is formed by bonding
diamond abrasive grain onto the inner circumference portion
of the thin ring-shaped metal base 20. For example, the
thickness of the metal base 20 may be 180 µm and the
thickness of the inner circumference cutting edge 22 may be
430 µm. The rotor 18 is driven and rotated by a motor not
shown. When the rotor 18 is lowered in this state, the end
of the semiconductor ingot 10 is cut off as shown by the
two-dot chain line. During this cutting, a liquid coolant, 
which may be plain water or a water solution of a surface
active agent, is sprayed on the inner circumference cutting
edge 22 from a liquid-emitting nozzle not shown. This liquid
coolant travels along the direction of the rotation of the
inner circumference cutting edge 22, enters the notch of the
partially cut portion of the semiconductor ingot and is
spread over both sides of the metal base 20.Because of this, when the cutting of the tail
portion 10b is completed, the tail portion 10b adheres to the
metal base 20 due to the film-like liquid coolant between the
metal base 20 and the tail portion 10b and the rotation force
of the metal base 20 is thereby communicated to the cut-off
tail portion 10b via the coolant. This results in the tail
portion 10b being propelled in the direction of the rotation
of the metal base 20. At this time, since the degree of
adhesion to the metal base 20 and the force received from the
metal base 20 in the direction of its rotation become greater
in proportion to the size of the contact surface of the tail
portion 10b and the metal base 20, the tail portion 10b will
be so propelled even when the diameter of the body portion
10a is large and also the weight of the tail portion 10b is
great. The weight of the tail portion 10b varies depending
upon the diameter of the body portion 10a; it typically
ranges from 1.5 to 8.5kg.As the tail portion 10b being
