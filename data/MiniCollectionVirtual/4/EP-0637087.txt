<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a layered structure comprising an 
insulator thin film and an oxide superconductor thin film, more 
specifically, to a layered structure comprising an insulator thin film and 
an oxide superconductor thin film, of which a portion of the insulator thin 
film can be removed without degradation of the oxide superconductor 
thin film. A superconducting field effect device has a superconducting channel 
electrically connecting a superconducting source and drain region and a 
gate electrode on the superconducting channel through a gate insulator. 
The superconducting field effect device is a voltage control type 
three-terminal superconducting device having current amplification 
ability, in which superconducting current flowing through the 
superconducting channel between the superconducting source and drain 
region is controlled by a signal voltage applied to the gate electrode. The 
superconducting field effect device can be manufactured by utilizing oxide 
superconductors, recently advanced in study, without severe fine 
processing conditions, so that it is considered to be favorably applicable  
 
for practical usage. This type of superconducting field devices are shown 
in U. S. Patent No. 5,236,896 by Nakamura et al. The superconducting field device disclosed by Nakamura et al. 
comprises a superconducting channel formed of an oxide superconductor 
thin film having a thickness of 5 nanometers and a gate insulator having a 
thickness of 10 nanometers which is enough to prevent tunnel current. 
The thickness of the superconducting channel and gate insulator are 
determined to perform complete ON/OFF operation by a signal voltage of 
several volts applied to a gate electrode. The superconducting field device 
also comprises a superconducting source region and a superconducting 
drain region formed of an oxide superconductor thin film having a 
thickness of a few hundreds nanometers which is enough to form contacts 
on them. In a prior art, the superconducting field effect device is 
manufactured by a process in which an oxide superconductor thin film 
which forms a superconducting channel, an insulator thin film and a 
normal conductor film are deposited in the named order. The normal 
conductor film and the insulator thin film are completely removed 
excluding portions which will be a gate electrode and a gate insulating 
layer. Oxide superconductor thin films are again deposited on the 
exposed surfaces of the first oxide superconductor thin film so as to form 
an
