<ABSTRACT>
An original process for the production of composite materials for a display screen, these materials comprising a polymer, liquid crystal and dye. The actual problem is the insertion of dye molecules into this type of composite. The process according to the invention proposes to produce, in a first step, a porous film of crosslinked polymer and then to cause liquid crystal (XL) molecules and dye (C) molecules to diffuse therein, by virtue of a solvent (L) swelling the polymer. After evaporation of the solvent a polymer film is obtained with inclusions comprising liquid crystal (XL) and dye (C), this being in a wide range of concentrations of liquid crystal, making it possible to optimise the contrast performance and the control voltage of the screen thus produced.
