<ABSTRACT>
Device for preventing damage to a lifting cylinder by a chain of a lift truck in which the chain guided along the lifting cylinder is connected at one end to a load-suspension means adjustable on a vertically adjustable lifting frame and at the other end to a non-adjustable section of the lifting frame. In this arrangement, a stop (22) is provided at the non-adjustable section of the lifting frame. The stop (22) has an opening (24) through which a link pin (26) connected to the chain (16) is passed. An abutment (30, 34) is attached to the link pin (26). Arranged between the abutment (30, 34) and the associated side of the stop (22) is a helical spring (40) which preloads the abutment (30, 34) away from the stop (22).
