<ABSTRACT>
This is a hydraulic anti-vibration device intended to be interposed between the body (9) and the engine (10) of a vehicle including an annular rigid reinforcing member (1), a rigid rod (2) passing through this reinforcing member, an annular spring (3) resting on the reinforcing member and interposed between the latter and the rod, which passes through it, a diaphragm (4) borne by the reinforcing member and delimiting, with an annular wall (5), a chamber located above the spring, a rigid intermediate partition (7) borne by the reinforcing member and splitting the inside of the chamber into two subchambers (A and B), a restricted passage (8) connecting the two subchambers together, a mass of fluid filling the two subchambers and the restricted passage, a first disc (6) bonded to the base of the annular wall, and a second disc (21) secured to the top of the rod, and resting on the spring. Means are provided for causing mutual axial separations of the two discs at will.

A hydraulic antivibration device designed to be 
interposed between two rigid elements, the structure of 

the device being circularly symmetrical about a vertical 
axis (X) and the device comprising: an annular rigid 

strength member (1) and a rigid rod (2) passing through 
said strength member, the strength member and the rod 

being suitable for being secured respectively to the two 
rigid elements that are to be united (9,10); an annular 

spring of elastomer (3) that withstands axial compression, 
resting against the strength member and the rod which passes 

through the spring; a leakproof flexible upper membrane 
(4) carried by the strength member and co-operating 

with at least one leakproof flexible annular wall (5) to 
define an enclosure disposed above the spring; an intermediate 

rigid partition (7) carried by the strength member, 
extending between the membrane and the annular wall and 

subdividing the inside of the enclosure into two chambers, 
a working bottom chamber (A) on the side of the spring, 

and a compensation chamber (B); a narrow passage (8) putting 
the two chambers permanently into communication with 

each other; a mass of liquid filling the two chambers and 
the narrow passage; a first disk (6) secured to the base 

of the annular wall; a second disk (2
1
) secured to the 
head of the rod, the second disk being disposed immediately 

beneath the first disk and resting on the spring; and 
control means for causing at will the two disks (2
1
,6) to 
move apart axially and subsequently to come back into contact.  

 
An antivibratory device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the control means are provided to 

axially displace the center of the membrane (4). 
An antivibratory device according to any one of 
claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the control means 

(20-23) are electrically actuated. 
An antivibratory device according to any one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the control 

means (13-15) bring a suction into play. 
An antivibration device according to claim 4, 
in which one of the two rigid elements is a vehicle engine, 

characterized in that the suction is generated by 
operation of said engine, and in that application of the 

suction is servo-controlled to the engine idling while the 
vehicle is stationary. 
An antivibration device according to any one of 
claims 4 and 5, characterized in that the means for controlling 

relative axial displacement of the two disks 
(2
1
,6) comprise: a lid (11) covering the membrane (4) so 
as to co-operate therewith to form a gastight housing 

(12), a pipe connecting the inside of said housing to a 
source of suction (14), and a control valve (15) mounted 

on said pipe so as to control the connection between the 
housing and the source. 
An antivibration device according to any one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that it comprises 

means for detecting the frequency of the vibrations applied 
to one of the strength members and means for servo-controlling 

the mutual separation of the two disks (2
1
,6) 
to the overpassing of a given threshold by said frequency. 
An antivibration device according to any one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the intermediate  

 
partition is pierced by an orifice enabling the two 

chambers (A,B) to be put into communication with each 
other, and fitted with a valve member or membrane (16) 

whose displacements or deformations are of a limited amplitude 
that is at most equal to 1 mm. 
An antivibration device according to claim 8, 
characterized in that it comprises means for detecting the 

amplitude of the vibrations applied to one of the strength 
members and means for servo-controlling the mutual separation 

of the two disks (2
1
,6) to the overpassing of a given 
threshold by said amplitude. 
An antivibration device according to any one 
of the preceding claims, characterized in that its hydraulic 

portion comprising the assembly constituted by the 
membrane (4), the wall (5), the disk (6) connected to said 

wall, and the intermediate partition (7) has an annular 
configuration about the axis (X), the disk connected to 

the wall then being in the form of a washer.
