<ABSTRACT>
An object of this invention is to provide a method of and an apparatus for manufacturing medium and 
low carbon ferromanganese, capable of reducing the running cost and manufacturing medium and low carbon 

ferromanganese at a low cost. To achieve this object, the method according to the present invention consists mainly of 
the steps of placing molten high carbon ferromanganese in a top-and-bottom blown type refining vessel, and blowing 

into the bath an oxygen gas from the upper side thereof and a mixed gas of the following composition from the bottom 
thereof. The mixed gas consists of 65-10 % of CO, 0-25 % of CO₂ and 0-10 % of N₂. A simple argon gas is used 

as a bottom blowing gas in some cases.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to method and apparatus 
for manufacturing medium or low carbon ferromanganese. It is usual practice to produce medium or low 
carbon ferromanganese by decarburizing molten high 
carbon ferromanganese in converters. It is known that 
the decarburisation reaction rate of the molten high 
carbon ferromanganese is determined according to the 
following major factors. 
1. Temperature of molten ferromanganese 2. Agitation of molten ferromanganese 3. Gas composition blown from bottom tuyeres. Among these factors, the temperature of the 
molten ferromanganese is set out in detail in United 
States Patent No. 3305353. According to this patent, 
the conditions of causing the decarburisation to 
proceed quickly in a pure oxygen top-blown converter 
where the oxygen gas is blown on the surface of the 
molten high carbon manganese, include a molten metal 
temperature not lower than 1550° C. It is set out that  
 
in order to cause decarburisation to proceed while 
suppressing oxidation of Mn in a medium or low carbon 
concentration region, the molten metal temperature 
should be not lower than 1700° C before the carbon 
concentration of the molten metal reaches 1.5 wt% or 
below. Among the above factors, the agitation of the 
molten ferromanganese is set forth in Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 57-27166. According to this 
publication, the decarburization proceeds very 
efficiently when using a converter which has double-pipe 
bottom tuyeres. More particularly, the yield of Mn 
amount in a pure oxygen top-blown converter (i.e. a 
converter which has no bottom tuyeres at the bottom 
thereof) is 79%. With a pure oxygen top blown 
converter having double-pipe bottom tuyeres, the yield 
of Mn amount is very high at 92%. The molten metal is 
more strongly stirred by the bottom-blown gas, thereby 
obtaining a high decarburisation reaction efficiency. The gas composition blown through the bottom 
tuyeres which is one of the factors is set out in 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 3-55538 in which 
reference is made to the above-indicated United States 
Patent No. 3305352 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 
57-27166 as prior art. According to this publication, 
when a bottom-blown gas is charged through the bottom  
 
tuyeres of a pure oxygen top blown converter, the 
composition of the bottom-blown gas is important. In 
the publication, argon gas, nitrogen gas, carbon 
dioxide gas or mixtures are used as the bottom-blown 
gas. However, if argon gas, nitrogen gas, carbon 
dioxide gas or mixtures
