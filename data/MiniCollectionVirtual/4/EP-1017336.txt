<ABSTRACT>
A radially expandable stent (10) made from a cannula or sheet of biocompatible material that includes at least one longitudinal segment (14) comprised of a series of laterally interconnected closed cells (13). Each closed cell of a longitudinal segment is defined laterally by a pair of longitudinal struts (15, 16) that are interconnected at each end by a circumferentially adjustable member (19, 20). When the stent is expanded using a balloon (47), the opposing circumferentially adjustable members deform to allow circumferential expansion of the longitudinal segment, while the length of the segment, as defined by the longitudinal struts, is maintained. Self-expanding versions of the stent utilize a nickel-titanium alloy. Adjacent longitudinal segments are joined by flexible interconnection segments (21) that permit the stent to bend laterally. The flexible interconnection segment is comprised of curvvilinear struts (22, 23) that form a series of serpentine bends (81) that distribute lateral bending forces. In a preferred embodiment, a short strut interconnects a longitudinal segment and adjacent interconnection segment. Each interconnection strut attaches to the longitudinal segment within a region (27) at the end (17) of a longitudinal strut (15) dividing two adjacent closed cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to medical devices and, in particular, to a radially expandable stent.Vascular stents are deployed at a narrowed site in a blood vessel of a patient for widening the vessel lumen and circumferentially supporting the vessel wall. Vascular stents desirably have a small cross-sectional diameter and/or profile for introducing the stent into the affected vessel lumen.One type of a vascular stent is made with a piece of wire that is bent into a number of turns. Although suitable for its intended use, a problem with these bent wire stents is that stress points are formed at each wire bend or turn. As a result, the wire stent is structurally compromised at a number of points. Furthermore, bent wire stents lack longitudinal stability. For example, a wire stent is typically positioned in a blood vessel over an inflatable balloon. The balloon expands first at opposite ends, where the balloon is not in contact with the wire stent. As a result, the wire stent is longitudinally shortened between the inflated balloon ends. With continued inflation, the middle of the balloon expands, thereby unevenly expanding the wire bends of the longitudinally shortened wire stent.Another type of a vascular stent is made with a wire mesh that is rolled into a generally tubular shape. A problem with this stent is that the overlapping wires forming the mesh increase the stent profile, thereby reducing the effective lumen of the blood vessel. The growth of endothelial tissue layers over the wire mesh further reduces the effective blood vessel lumen. Another problem with this approach is that ion migration also occurs at the wire-to-wire contact points.Yet another type of a vascular stent is made with a flat metal sheet with a number of openings formed in rows therein. The flat metal sheet stent also includes rows of fingers or projections positioned on one edge of the stent along the axis thereof. When expanded, a row of the fingers or projections is positioned through a row of openings on the opposite edge of the stent for locking the expanded configuration of the stent. A problem with the use of the flat metal sheet stent is that the overlapping edges of the stent increase the stent profile. Again, the stent profile and endothelial growth reduce the effective blood vessel lumen. Another problem with the use of the flat metal sheet stent is that the fingers or projections along one edge of the stent make metal to metal contact with the opposite edge of the stent. As a result, the metal edges of the
