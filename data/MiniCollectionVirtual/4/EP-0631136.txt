<ABSTRACT>
The device contains an inlet part (1) for the fibre band to be measured and a measurement part (2) following on from the inlet part. Two measurement members (4; 8, 9) working according to different measuring principles are arranged on the measurement part (2), namely a so-called fibre-compression measuring member (4) which mechanically scans the fibre band and a so-called active-pneumatic measuring member (8, 9) for measuring the pneumatic pressure caused by the fibre band on a constriction. Use for measuring the mass of fibre bands, for ascertaining a parameter for their manufacture or for separate regulation and monitoring in a control system.

<CLAIMS>
Device for measuring the mass or substance cross-section
of slivers, with an entry part (1) for the

sliver to be measured and with a measuring part (2),
adjoining the entry part, with a measuring element

which comprises a measuring bar (4) which mechanically
samples the sliver (FB), characterized in that there

is provided on the measuring part (2) a second
measuring element for the sliver mass, operating

according to a different measurement principle, which
comprises a means (8, 9) for measuring the pneumatic

pressure caused by the sliver (FB) at a contraction.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
measuring part (2) comprises a measuring channel (3)

which is delimited by a face and a grooved sliver
guide, the face belonging to the one measuring bar (4)

which mechanically samples the sliver (FB), and in
that the measuring element (8, 9) is disposed with

means for measuring the pneumatic pressure in this
measuring channel.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the
measuring element (8, 9) is disposed with means for

measuring the pneumatic pressure, in the face of the
measuring channel (3) containing the measuring

bar (4).
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the
measuring element (8, 9) is disposed with means for

measuring the pneumatic pressure in a grooved sliver-guide
part of the measuring channel (3) located

opposite the face containing the measuring bar (4).
Device according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized in
that the signals obtained from the two measuring

elements (4; 8, 9) are fed to a common evaluation 
stage in which comparison of the two signals is

performed.
Use of the device according to Claim 1 for obtaining a
characteristic quantity for the composition of the

recorded sliver, the signals of the two measuring
elements (4; 8, 9) being examined for mutual

deviations characteristic of specific parameters
influencing the composition.
Use according to Claim 6, characterised in that
characteristic deviations of the signal of the

measuring element (8, 9) are interpreted, with means
for measuring the pneumatic pressure, as an indication

of fluctuations in the fibre fineness.
Use according to Claim 6, characterized in that
characteristic deviations of the signal of the

measuring element (4) which comprises a measuring bar
(4) which mechanically samples the sliver (FB) are

interpreted as an indication of fluctuations in the
sliver composition.
Use according to Claim 6, characterized in that
characteristic deviations of the signal of the

measuring element (4) which comprises a measuring bar
(4) which mechanically samples the sliver (FB) are

interpreted as an indication of so-called "floating"
fibres, and in that such indications are used for

setting the optimum drafting-unit distance of drafting
points on sliver-producing machines.
Use of the device according to Claim 1 for separate
regulation and monitoring in a control stage, the

signal of one measuring element (8, 9) being used for
sliver regulation and the signal of the other 

measuring element (4) being used for sliver
monitoring.
