<ABSTRACT>
A method for supplementing the amino acid levels in 
ruminants is provided where rumen-protected amino acids, 

particularly lysine and/or methionine, are used to supplement 
ruminant feed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for supplementing
amino acids in ruminant animals. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a method wherein a rumen-protected feed
additive composition comprising methionine and/or lysine is added
to feed which is then fed to the ruminant prior to or after
calving and continuing into the ruminant's lactation period.
This method increases the digestible amino acids available in the
feed and positively increases the milk production of ruminants
who are fed the additive. The method also improves ruminant
health and appetite.A ruminant is an animal which possesses a complex stomach
consisting of four morphologically distinct compartments. These
compartments are rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum. The
former two are derived from the terminal portion of the
esophagus, and only the latter two are considered to be a genuine
stomach. After passing the first two compartments, the food is
returned to the mouth. The rumen and the reticulum are
fermentation compartments wherein Ophryoscolex Diplodinium and
Plectridium cellulolyticum are commensal, and the digestion of
the feed (vegetable tissues) is conducted by cellulase, amylase, 
or cellobiose secreted by these microorganisms (digestive
symbiosis).In ruminant animals like cattle or sheep, there is a
problem that occurs when a biologically active substance is, for
instance, orally administered: a substantial part of the
substance (e.g., proteins, amino acids, etc.) are decomposed to
ammonia or carbon dioxide gas by microorganisms in the rumen,
making it difficult or impossible for the animal to effectively
utilize all of the administered proteins and amino acids
contained in feed, etc. Thus, a ruminant only receives the
benefit of a portion of the nutrients fed to it and loses a
portion to the support and formation of rumen microorganisms.
While the nutrients (proteins, etc.) contained in feed clearly
contribute to a ruminant's sustenance, another source of
nutrition for ruminants is the protein derived from those
microorganisms in the rumen which is passed to the lower
stomachs. Accordingly, it is important to maintain the
microorganism population in the rumen in order to provide a
constant source of this protein.When special nutrients or drugs which must be absorbed or
metabolized are administered to ruminants it is important to
protect these substances from the environmental conditions in the
first stomach: i.e., from decomposition by microorganisms and
from the influence of weakly acidic or weakly

<CLAIMS>
A method for increasing milk production in ruminant
animals comprising feeding said animals a rumen-protected

feed additive comprising lysine, methionine or a mixture
thereof each day beginning at any time from 60 to 5 days prior to the

parturition date of said ruminant animal and
continuing said feeding at most 5 months into the lactation

period of said animal.
A method for increasing milk production in ruminant
animals comprising feeding said animals a rumen-protected

feed additive comprising lysine, methionine or a mixture
thereof each day beginning approximately 1 day after

parturition and continuing said feeding at most 5 months into
the lactation period of said animal.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein said
rumen-protected feed additive is added to a base feed in an

amount sufficient to provide that amount of lysine and
methionine required by said animal.
A method for increasing milk production in ruminant
animals comprising feeding said animals (a) a low protein

feed each day beginning approximately weeks prior to the
scheduled parturition date of said ruminant animal, (b) a low

to middle protein feed, together with, or without, a rumen-protected
feed additive comprising lysine, methionine or a

mixture thereof each day beginning between approximately 4
weeks and approximately 1 week prior to said scheduled

parturition date, (c) a middle protein feed together with
said rumen-protected feed additive each day beginning the

parturition day of said animal for a period of between
approximately 4 weeks and approximately 5 months, and (d) a

middle protein or high protein feed each day during the 
remaining lactation period of said animal, wherein said low,

middle and high protein feeds contain 10-14 % by weight, 15-16

% by weight and 17-22 % by weight of protein on dry basis,
respectively.
