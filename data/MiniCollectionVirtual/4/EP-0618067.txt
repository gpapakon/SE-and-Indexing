<ABSTRACT>
A pressure-bonded composite material includes at least one 
layer of a stabilized low carbon steel core material and one 

layer of a stainless steel joined at an interface, wherein the 
stabilized carbon steel includes columbium and at least one 

other carbide-forming element in amounts effective to prevent 
carbon migration from the carbon steel to the stainless steel 

and the composite material has a physical grain size no larger 
than ASTM #6.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to both a composite material
and a method for producing the composite material. More
particularly, the invention relates to both a pressure-bonded
stainless steel and carbon steel composite material, and a
method for producing the composite material.Pressure-bonded composites of individual layers of steel
are used in a variety of applications. As noted in United
States Patent No. 3,693,242,
a composite comprising a core layer of plain carbon steel
containing a carbide former and outer layers of stainless
steel is used in producing certain metal items such as, for
example, cookware. Related U.S. Patents include Nos.
3,795,971, 3,862,484, 3,944,396 and 3,956,809.
The stainless steel
surface layers of the composite are corrosion-resistant and
provide an attractive appearance, while the plain carbon steel
core layer has relatively greater heat conducting properties
than the stainless steel layers. A specific example of this
type of composite material is A.I.S.I. Type 304DA ("T-304DA")
which has a conventional low carbon steel core material and
surface layers of A.I.S.I. Type 304 stainless steel ("T-304").
In hot processing conventional T-304DA, the standard practice
is to cool the hot-rolled band to below 482°C (900°F) on the hot run
out table before coiling. Failure to so cool the hot-rolled
band to below (900°F) 482° C causes carbon from the low carbon
steel core material to migrate into the interface region
between the stainless steel surface layers and the low carbon
steel core. This carbon migration occurs against the carbon 
concentration gradient and is dependent primarily on the
attainment of an overall lower free energy. Such a migration
against the concentration gradient frequently occurs from
plain carbon steel to stainless steel because the stainless
steel contains chromium which attracts the carbon.Once migrated to the interface region, the carbon forms
carbides, and thereby results in carbide enriched regions near
the interface region. These carbide enriched regions cause
so-called "Hook Cracks" upon drawing, an undesirable defect in
the final product. In addition, carbon migration leads to the
formation of a coarse ferrite grain layer in the low carbon
core material which causes the defect known as "Orange Peel
Surface" in the final product. Also, failure to cool below
482°C (900°F) may result in metal separation, whereby one or more
stainless steel layers delaminate from the low carbon steel
core layer.In preventing these problems by cooling the hot-rolled
band
