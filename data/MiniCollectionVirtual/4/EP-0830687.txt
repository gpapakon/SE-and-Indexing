<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of electronic encoding and decoding, and
more particularly to encoders and decoders useful for transmitting and receiving secure
signals for remotely controlling systems.Controlling systems and devices by remote control is becoming increasingly popular
in many applications. Examples of such applications are numerous, some of the most
common include security systems for buildings, security systems for vehicles, garage
door and gate openers. These systems typically employ a transmitter to send an
encoded signal to a receiver which decodes the signal and causes the desired operation
to be performed. Of course, as these systems become more widely used, unscrupulous
efforts to defeat them also increase.For example, in relatively unsophisticated systems, a single fixed code is transmitted
to a receiver which has been configured to operate in response to only that particular
code.However, a fixed code system is easily defeated by several methods. One
method is to use a device called a code scanner which transmits all possible
combinations of fixed codes. For example, in systems using eight DIP switches to
select the code, there are only two hundred and fifty-six (256) possible fixed code
combinations. A code scanner can typically transmit this number of combinations in
less that thirty-two seconds. Even in systems using sixteen bit keys, yielding 65,536
combinations, only a little more than two hours would be required to try all possible
combinations. Moreover, the scanner may gain access in far less than this maximum
time, in fact, the average time would be half of the maximum time.Another way of gaining unauthorized access is to simply intercept and retransmit the
signal. For example, a remote control transmitter of the type normally used in vehicle 
security and remote control systems includes a small radio transmitter that transmits
a code number on a specific frequency. This code number is normally generated by
an integrated circuit encoder. The transmission frequency is usually fixed by
legislation within a particular country, therefore it is possible to build a receiver that
can receive signals from all such transmitters. Such a receiver is used together with
a circuit which records the transmissions captured by the intended receiver. Such a
device is known as a code or key grabber and can be used to gain access to protected
premises or to vehicles with remote control security systems.To control the threat of unauthorized access, remote control systems have
