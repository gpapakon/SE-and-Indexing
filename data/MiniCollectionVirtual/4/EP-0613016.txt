<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a voltage detecting
apparatus. The invention has particular, but not
exclusive, application as a measurement device for
detecting a very low voltage applied to a local portion of
a device to be measured.As conventional methods for measuring a very low
voltage signal applied to a local portion of a device to be
measured, the first method for measuring a voltage signal
by contacting a probe of an oscilloscope to an electrical
circuit to be measured, the second method for optically
measuring a voltage signal using an E-O probe consisting of
an electro-optic crystal, and the like are known. As an
example of the second measurement method, a method
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 156379/1991 is
known. This reference discloses a technique for detecting
an electrical signal applied to an electrical circuit to be
measured without bringing the E-O probe into contact with a
device to be measured.However, in the first measurement method, since a
measurement is performed by bringing the probe into direct
contact with an electrical circuit to be measured, the  
constant of the electrical circuit undesirably changes.
Furthermore, a signal waveform upon transmission is
distorted due to the distributed constant of a transmission
line for connecting the probe and a main body, or external
noise is superposed on an electrical signal on the
transmission line, thus deteriorating the S/N ratio. Owing
to these problems, it is difficult to measure a true
electrical signal by the measurement method using the
oscilloscope.It is difficult to measure a plurality of points at
the same time by the second measurement method.
Furthermore, due to a very small electro-optic crystal, and
a large number of optical elements, it is difficult to
align the optical elements.Fig. 5 of EP-A-0 293 841 shows a voltage detector 50 which comprises an optical probe 52, a light
source 53, and an optical fiber 51 which guides the light from the light source 53 into the
optical probe 52. Fig. 1 shows an optical probe 1 corresponding to optical probe 52 in Fig.
5. The optical probe 1 is filled with an electro-optic material 62' between a transparent
electrode 2 and a reflection mirror 65 in the form of a metal film. In use, the tip 63 of the
probe 1 is brought close to an object 6 at which a voltage is to be measured. This voltage is
induced at the metal film 65, and the refractive index of the electro-optic material 62'
changes in accordance with the lines of the electric force ELN 1 between the metal film 65
