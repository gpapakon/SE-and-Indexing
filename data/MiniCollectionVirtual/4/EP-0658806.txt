<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photographic
elements having a layer containing both a
1-aryl-4-aryloxy-2-pyrazolin-5-one magenta coupler, and a
sulfide, sulfoxide or sulfone compound.In a silver halide photographic element, a
color image is formed when the material is exposed to
light and then subjected to color development with a
primary amine developer. The color development results
in imagewise reduction of silver halide and production
of oxidized developer. The oxidized primary amine
developer subsequently reacts with one or more
incorporated dye-forming couplers to form dye in an
imagewise fashion. Some couplers, referred to as DIR
couplers, release a development inhibitor compound or
fragment upon coupling with the oxidized primary amine
developer. Further, some of these DIR couplers release
the inhibitor compound or fragment with a time delay.
These are sometimes referred to as DIAR couplers.A variety of magenta dye-forming coupler
types have been used in color photographic materials.
These include pyrazoloazole couplers,
1-phenyl-3-acylamino-2-pyrazolin-5-one couplers and 1-phenyl-3-anilino-2-pyrazolin-5-one
couplers. U.S. Patents
3,419,391, 3,519,429 and 4,248,962, 4,585,728,
4,692,529, 4,724,198, and 4,977,073 disclose couplers
which include 1-aryl-4-aryloxy-2-pyrazolin-5-one type
couplers. Many compounds, including sulfur-containing
addenda, have been previously tried or suggested for
use in conjunction with couplers in an effort to
improve coupler activity. For example, Rody et al
disclose cyclic sulfide, sulfoxide and sulfone
stabilizers in U.S. Patents 4,933,271, 5,006,665 and
5,070,007. Cyclic sulfoxide and sulfone stabilizers
are also disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,017,465. Sulfone-containing
addenda are used in combination with magenta
dye-forming couplers in U.S. Patent 4,770,987. Yamada
et al disclose combinations of magenta dye-forming
couplers, phenolic compounds and sulfide or sulfoxide
compounds in U.S. Patent 4,113,488. Combinations of
sulfoxide or sulfone compounds and pyrazolotriazole
magenta dye-forming couplers are disclosed in U.S.
Patent 5,232,821 of Merkel et al.Magenta dye-forming coupler compositions of
high activity that efficiently react with oxidized
developer are, however, still needed. There is also a
need for magenta dye-forming DIR (including DIAR)
coupler compositions that efficiently release
development inhibitors. EP 510576 describes the
addition of a sulfoxide to a pyrazolone coupler
containing layer to improve continued coupling.It has been found that while
