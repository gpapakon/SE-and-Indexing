<ABSTRACT>
There is described a support socle (1) of trapezoidal cross-section, which comprises a base (2), two side walls (3, 4) and an upper side (5), having mutually complementary first and second coupling elements (15, 19) to which adjacent support socles (1, 1') can be coupled. According to the invention, provision is made for each side wall (3 and 4) to exhibit a plane wall section (10) which merges into the base (2) at an acute angle ( alpha ), and for a concave transition region (11) forming a step to adjoin the plane wall section (10), said transition region being followed by a second plane wall section (12).

A guide edging member (1) of trapezoidal cross-section, which 
has a base (2), two side walls (3, 4) and a top side (5), with mutually 

complementary first and second coupling elements (15, 19) with which 
adjacent guide edging members (1) can be coupled, wherein each side wall 

(3, 4) has a flat wall portion (10) which goes into the base (2) at an 
acute
 angle and which is adjoined by a concave transitional region (11) 
which forms a step and which is followed by a second flat wall portion 

(12), wherein the two flat wall portions (10, 12) are in different planes 
and wherein the second flat wall portion (12) is set back towards the 

centre of the guide edging member (1), characterised in that the guide 
edging member (1) is about 20 cm to 26 cm wide at the base (2) and/or 7 cm 

to 10 cm high, that the flat wall portion (10) goes into the base (2) at 
an acute angle (α) of 30 to 45° and that the concave transitional region 

(11) is about 0.5 to 2 cm and preferably 0.5 to 1 an long. 
A guide edging member according to claim 1 characterised in 
that it is about 1 m long and that the length of the first flat wall 

portion (10) is about 3 to 5 cm and/or the length of the second flat wall 
portion (12) is about 5 to 7 cm. 
A guide edging member according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the transition of the flat wall portion (10) into 

the base (2) is chamfered and the chamfered region (8) is about 2 to 8 mm 
high and goes into the base (2) at an angle (β) which is between the 

angle (α) and 90°. 
A guide edging member according to claim 3 characterised in 
that the chamfered region (8) goes progressively into the flat wall 

portion (10). 
A guide edging member according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the second flat wall portion (12) goes into the top 

side (5) in a curved portion (13).  
 
A guide edging member according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the mutually complementary coupling elements (15, 

19) are formed integrally and at the ends (14, 18) of the guide edging 
member (1, 1') so that two guide edging members (1, 1') can be fitted one 

into the other. 
A guide edging member according to claim 6 characterised in 
that the first coupling element (15) comprises a neck (16) which adjoins 

an end (14) of the guide edging member (1) and which has a knob (17) at 
its free end and the second coupling element (19) is in the form of a 

recess (20) at the other end (18) of the guide edging member (1), said 
recess (20) being complementary to the neck (16) and to the knob (17). 
A guide edging member according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that it has at least one receiving opening (22) or other 

recess in which a guide flag (23) possibly covered with a reflective layer 
can be fixed and in particular inserted therein and/or can be secured with 

an insertion member. 
A guide edging member according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that it has an insertion opening (25) for a lifting hook. 
A guide edging member according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that it is made from recycled material and is preferably 

cold-pressed from granular material. 
A guide edging member according to claim 10 characterised in 
that the recycled material has a proportion of rubber granular material, 

in particular of from 25% to 35%. 
A guide edging member according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that its surface is provided with a reflective material, 

in particular with glass bead-containing painting on all or part thereof 
or surface painting, coating or the like.  

 
A guide edging member according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that it is provided at the base with non-slip profile 

portions, preferably knobs (6, 7), cleats or the like, the profile 
portions comprising plastics material, rubber or the like. 
A guide edging member according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that it is from 10 kg to 20 kg and in particular 16 kg in 

weight.
