<ABSTRACT>
A braking system typically for tractors comprising two front 
steered wheels, at least the two braking rear wheels (22) being 

provided with respective hydraulically operated independent brake 
units (21), in which the hydraulic circuits (3) of said brake 

units (21) are connected to the pump (5) of a single brake pedal 
(6), and are provided with respective devices (33) which are 

sensitive to the position of the steered wheels such that the 
braking of the one or other rear wheel depends on the position of 

the steered wheels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a braking system which is particularly
but not exclusively suitable for tractors.These latter are known to comprise a frame mounted on four wheels,
of which the front wheels are steered wheels and the rear wheels
are provided with respective hydraulically operated brake units.In particular, said two brake units are provided with separate
hydraulic circuits, they being operated by two separate brake
pedals.This is to facilitate the manoeuvring of the tractor around bends,
particularly on fields.In this respect, on operating the brake of that rear wheel
internal to the bend the tractor tends to rotate about the wheel
which is at that moment braked.With the brake pedals there is associated a U-piece by which these
latter can be connected together to form a single brake pedal, ie
able to control both brake units.This U-piece is normally disengaged during the use of the tractor
on fields for the aforesaid reasons, and is engaged when the
tractor is transferred to the road.However it can happen, and indeed has happened, that the tractor
driver forgets to engage the U-piece when travelling on the road. Consequently when braking, only a single brake pedal is frequently
pressed, with the result that the tractor tends to rotate about
the rear wheel which is braked at that moment.It should be noted that this can result in situations of serious
danger, especially if the tractor is travelling at a certain
speed.Basically in such situations the tractor tends to move towards the
edge of the road or towards the opposite lane depending on which
pedal is pressed.The main object of the present invention is to provide a braking
system particularly for tractors which is able to obviate the
aforesaid within the context of a simple and rational
construction.In US-A-3 932 002, an apparatus for automative vehicles is disclosed, for
controlling the liquid pressure of a hydraulic braking system connected to the
master cylinder of a single brake pedal. However this apparatus is for
preventing undesired locking of the inside wheels in a braking action during a
turning. Furthermore, the apparatus plays reducing the braking force upon the
inside wheels.The idea on which the invention is based is to make the braking of
the one or other rear wheel dependent on the position of the front
steered wheels.According to the invention, in the system concerned the two brakes
are operated by a single pedal, along the hydraulic circuits of
said two brakes there being interposed respective devices for
excluding the

<CLAIMS>
A braking system tipically for tractors comprising two front steering wheels
(12) and at least two braking rear wheels (22) which are provide with two

hydraulically operated indipendent brake units (21), the hydraulic circuits (3)
of said brake units (21) being connected to the master cylinder (5) of a single

brake pedal (6), 
characterized in that
the hydraulic circuits (3) of said brake units (21) are provided with respective
devices (33) which are sensitive to the angular position of the steered wheels

such
that when the steered wheels are in a substantially neutral configuration, both
said brake units are activated, whereas when the steered wheels are in a steered

configuration exceeding a certain angle, only the brake unit pertaining to that
rear wheel internal to the bend is activated.
A system as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that said
devices (33) each consist of a valve unit interposed along the

respective hydraulic circuit and arranged to open and close in
response to a substantially neutral configuration and a steering

configuration of the steered wheels respectively.
A system as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that said
valve unit consists of a solenoid valve.
A system as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that
between each solenoid valve and the steered wheel control system

there is interposed a sensor (8) for sensing the position of this
latter.
A system as claimed in claims 3 and 4, characterized in
that the connection between each solenoid valve and the respective

sensor (8) is intercepted by means (70) arranged to exclude this 
latter when the tractor exceeds a predetermined speed.
A system as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that said
means (70) consist of a switch under the control of a speed sensor

(77).
