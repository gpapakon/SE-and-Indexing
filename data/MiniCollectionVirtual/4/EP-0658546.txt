NR3R5R6 or -NR5R6; - R5 represents hydrogen or a (C1-C6)alkyl and R6 represents hydrogen, a (C1-C6)alkyl, a phenyl or a (C3-C8)cycloalkyl or R5 and R6, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, constitute a saturated or unsaturated, 5- to 10-membered, heterocyclic radical which is unsubstituted or substituted one or a number of times by a C1-C6 alkyl, a benzyl, a phenyl, a hydroxyl, a C1-C6 alkoxy or a halogen; - R3 represents a (C1-C6)alkyl or R3 forms a bridge with one of the atoms of the heterocyclic radical formed by NR5R6; provided that, when R2 represents NR5R6, R5 and R6, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, constitute a heterocyclic radical other than a saturated 5- to 8-membered radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by a (C1-C3)alkyl, a hydroxyl or a benzyl;  to their salts and to their solvates. The present invention also relates to a process for producing these new derivatives and to the pharmaceutical compositions which contain them.
