<ABSTRACT>
An endless track unit (18) has a main driving wheel (20) and two deflecting wheels (22, 24) which have a mutual track (26) wound around them. The two deflecting wheels (22, 24) are held rotatably by a vertically pivotable link (38) or an arm (56), respectively, the link (38) being coupled pivotably to a tilting frame (46) and the arm (56) being coupled pivotably to a tilting bearing (50), which also pivotably holds the tilting frame (46).

<CLAIMS>
A crawler track unit with a main drive wheel (20), first and second deviating 
wheels (22) and (24), a running track (26), a tilting frame (46) tilting about a tilt 

bearing (50), a lever (38) pivotally attached to the tilting frame (46) for rotatably 
receiving one deviating wheel (22) and an arm (56) for rotatably receiving the second 

deviating wheel (24), characterized in that the arm (56) is arranged to pivot about the 
tilt bearing (50) and the tilting frame (46) is resiliently braced relative to the
 arm (56). 
A crawler track unit according to claim 1, characterized in that the arm (56) is 
in the form of a telescopic arm and can be altered in its length in particular by means 

of a hydraulic actuator. 
A crawler track unit according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the lever 
(38) is in the form of a two-armed, cranked lever, to one of whose arms (39) is fitted 

the first deviating wheel (22) and to whose other arm (37) is fitted one or more track 
rollers (28, 30, 32). 
A crawler track unit according to claim 3, characterized in that, with a plurality 
of track rollers (28, 30, 32), at least two track rollers (28, 30) are connected together 

by a bridge (34) and the bridge (34) is pivotally articulated by a bridge joint (33) to the 
other arm (37). 
A crawler track unit according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that, with a 
plurality of track rollers (28, 30, 32), a further two-armed lever (36) is fitted pivotally 

on the other arm (37), which receives a track roller (28, 30) or the bridge (34) on a 
first arm (51) and receives a further track roller (32) or the bridge on a second arm 

(43).
