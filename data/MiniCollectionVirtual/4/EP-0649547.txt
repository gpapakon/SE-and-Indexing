<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to memory cards pluggable in personal computers. The portable computers are often comprised of a connector intended to receive a memory extension in the form of pluggable integrated circuit card. The invention discloses a card structure intended to the communication between the computer and the outside (fax, modem, etc.), said card being pluggable in the connector of the memory extension, without being necessary to change the utilization protocol of said connector. The card is comprised of a connector (CNC) for connection to the computer, a connector (CNX) for connection to the outside, an internal microprocessor (MP), a non-volatile memory (MNV) containing programs which may be executed by the microcomputer and containing data for organizing all memories of the card, and a volatile memory (MV) containing at least one file intended to the transfer of data to be exchanged.

<CLAIMS>
A communication card intended to be plugged
into a computer, the said card comprising:


an internal microprocessor (MP);
a connector (CNC) enabling the card to be
plugged into the computer;
non-volatile memories (MNV) containing work
programs executable by the computer and format data

concerning the organisation structure of the card
memory files;
a volatile memory (MV) connected to the internal
microprocessor by an address (AD2), data (BD2) and

control signal (SC2) bus, this memory comprising a
physical location reserved for the temporary storage of

the data to be transferred from the computer to the
outside or from the outside to the computer, the

address of this physical location and the name of the
file for this physical location being stored in the

non-volatile memory: these memories being accessible to
the personal computer by means of an address (AD), data

(BD) and control signal (SC) bus, these three buses
issuing from the said connector (CNC);
a supplementary interface circuit (IF1) allowing
communication between the card and the outside.
A communication card according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 it comprises a supplementary
connector (CNX) which is a connector for connection

with a flush-contact chip card, and 
in that
 the
programs in non-volatile memory comprise programs for 

reading and/or writing data in the chip card.
