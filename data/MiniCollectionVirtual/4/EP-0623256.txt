<ABSTRACT>
A modulator (26) and a demodulator (30) are for use in a simulcast paging system. The modulator (26) samples a non-return-to-zero input, interpolates transitions between logic levels and produces a frequency shift keyed filtered signal at a center frequency different than that used for transmitting. The demodulator (30) digitizes and shifts the signal to a center frequency of zero Hertz producing a complex baseband, and from an interpolation of the time derivative of the instantaneous phase determines the logic level of signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally pertains to an asynchronous modem, and more
specifically, to a demodulator for an asynchronous variable speed modem.Modems are frequently used in paging systems to transmit data over telephone
lines or by radio transmission between a central paging terminal and a plurality of
paging transmitters, which re-transmit the data as a radio signal to a pager unit carried
by an individual subscriber to the paging service. The data received by the paging unit
of the intended recipient can then be read by the subscriber on a display screen that is
part of the pager unit. To ensure that the data signal reaches the individual's pager
unit anywhere in a defined geographic coverage area, the plurality of paging
transmitters in the system have overlapping reception zones, and the same data signal
is simultaneously broadcast from each of the paging transmitters. Paging systems
with this type of simultaneous zone coverage are referred to as simulcast paging
systems.When first developed, simulcast paging systems typically transmitted data to
subscribers at a relatively low rate, e.g., 512 or 600 baud. Subsequently, the
increased demand on paging systems for higher data throughput as greater numbers of
pagers have been placed into service has prompted an increase in the data rate of the
modems used to transfer data between the central paging terminal and the paging
transmitters to 1,200 baud. Integrated circuit modem chipsets conforming to the 
Bell 202 or the V.23 standards are readily available to achieve this level of
performance. However, there is now a demand for paging modems that can operate
at still higher baud rates, e.g., at or above 2,400 baud, because simulcast paging
systems are being forced to access still more customers over a limited number of radio
channels. It is therefore critically important that each data message be transmitted as
rapidly as possible to enable more customers to be serviced. Unfortunately,
asynchronous paging modems capable of operating at the higher baud rates are not
presently available. Conventional modems are limited in speed, at least for this type
of application, for several technical reasons, the most important of which are their
inherent isochronous distortion level and maximum data rate limitation of about
1,500 baud.To achieve data rates in excess of about 1,200 baud, an asynchronous modem
suitable for use in a simulcast paging system must be capable of operation at a
relatively low isochronous distortion level. Isochronous distortion level is
