<ABSTRACT>
A device for plasticising thermoplastic material, especially waste, has a plasticizing worm (18) carried in a housing (21) into which the material to be plasticised is introduced via an inlet aperture (16). At this inlet aperture (16) there is a masticating device in the form of two parallel shafts (3, 4) arranged parallel to the axis of the worm (18), each of which has a plurality of disc-like masticating tools (8) fitted on it. Between each two adjacent masticating tools (8) there is a circular spacer (9) and fixed upright blades (11) engage in the gap between adjacent masticating tools (8) with their sides (15) tangential to the circumference (13) of the spacers (9). The two shafts (3, 4) are driven at different speeds and their blades formed by the masticating tools (8) masticate the material and press it into the threads of the worm (18). This ensures a reliable construction with good mastication of the material.

<CLAIMS>
A device for plasticising thermoplastics material, in particular 
plastics waste, comprising a screw (18) mounted in a 

housing (21), the material to be plasticised being fed 
through a feed opening (16) in the housing (21) to the screw 

(18) which conveys the plastics material to a discharge 
opening (20) arranged at an axial distance from the feed 

opening (16) and provided for the plasticised plastics 
material, wherein a comminution device for the plastics 

material is connected to the feed opening (16) and 
comprises two comminuting tools (8) arranged on two shafts 

(3, 4) extending parallel to each other and preferably 
parallel to the axis of the screw (18) and driven in 

counterrotation, the said comminuting tools (8) conveying 
the comminuted plastics material into the feed opening (16) 

of the screw housing (21) and each being provided with 
teeth (10) acting on the plastics material fed between the 

shafts (3, 4), characterised in that the shafts (3, 4) are driven 
at different speeds, the direction of rotation of the faster 

rotating shaft (4) being contrary to the direction of rotation 
of the screw (18), in that the comminuting tools (8) are 

arranged on the shafts (3, 4) at an axial distance apart and 
the circular paths of the teeth (10) of the comminuting tools 

(8) of the two shafts (3, 4) overlap, viewed in the axial 
direction of the shafts (3, 4), and in that spacers (9) having a 

circular circumference (13) are provided between adjacent 
comminuting tools (8) at least on the faster rotating shaft (4), 

fixed blades (11) engaging between the comminuting tools 
(8) of this shaft (4) and the edges (15) of the fixed blades (11) 

extending tangentially to the circumference (13) of the 
spacers (9) on this shaft (4), the said edges (15) facing the 

gap between the shafts (3, 4).  
 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
edges (15) also extend tangentially to the wall (39) of the 

feed opening (16). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
both shafts (3, 4) are provided with circular spacers (9) 

arranged between the disc-type comminuting tools (8), the 
edges (15) of the fixed blades (11) extending tangentially 

and symmetrically in relation to the said spacers (9) relative 
to the central plane (7) between the two shafts (3, 4), the 

circular parts of the fixed blades (11), adjoining these edges 
(15) in the direction of rotation of the shafts (3, 4), preferably 

extending following the circumference (13) of the spacers 
(9). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the circular path of the outermost parts of the teeth (10) 

is at a distance (a) from the circumference of the screw 
flights (19) which is 0.5 to 1.5 times the distance between the 

circular path of these teeth parts and the circumference of 
the spacers (9). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that filler pieces (27) are arranged between adjacent fixed 

blades (11). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that projections (22) or grooves are provided in the wall of 

the housing (21) of the screw (18) at least in the region of the 
feed opening (16) and preferably extend in the axial 

direction of the screw (18), the said wall being at a distance 
from the circumference of the screw flights (19). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that a cooling device (33), e.g. a cooling fan (34), is 

associated with the housing (21) of the screw (18) at least in 
the region of the feed opening (16).  

 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that a heating device (37), e.g. heating bands (38) lying 

against the housing jacket, is associated with the housing 
(21) of the screw (18) at least in that region of the screw (18) 

adjacent to the discharge opening (20). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in 
that the screw (18) and the two shafts (3, 4) are driven by a 

common drive (40) (Fig.5).
