<ABSTRACT>
In a combustion chamber, a gaseous or liquid fuel is sprayed as a secondary flow into a gaseous, channelled main flow. The main flow is passed over vortex generators (9), of which several are arranged next to one another over the width or the periphery of the channel (20) through which the flow passes. The height (h) of the vortex generators is at least 50% of the height (H) of the channel through which the flow passes or of the channel part allocated to the vortex generator. The secondary flow is directed into the channel (20) in the immediate area of the vortex generators (9). With the novel static mixer, longitudinal vortices without a recirculation zone are generated in the channel through which the flow passes. Exceptionally short mixing distances with at the same time little pressure loss are thus achieved in the combustion chamber.
