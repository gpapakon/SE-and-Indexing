<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compounds useful as a 
vehicle for a paste for electronics applications and as 
a fluxing additive in wire solder fluxes. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a liquid vehicle 
for suspending inorganic particles which are used in 
thick film and solder paste applications. The electronics industry uses particulate-based 
high-solids pastes in a variety of applications to 
ultimately provide conductive or dielectric capability 
in an electronic component. These pastes typically 
contain inorganic particles and an organic medium or 
vehicle. The inorganic particles provide the electrical 
functionality in the ultimate application, i.e., 
insulative or non-conducting inorganic particles form 
dielectric parts, and conductive inorganic particles, 
primarily metals, form conductive parts. The organic 
medium facilitates application and control of the 
location of the inorganic particles. After application 
of the paste, the organic medium is removed by heating 
and the inorganic particles are fused or sintered to 
form the electrically functional part. To apply the 
paste to the desired locations in the desired patterns, 
it is necessary that the paste flow well with the 
application method employed, such as stencil or screen 
printing, pressure dispensing, syringe dispensing, etc.  A rheology modifying agent or agents is typically 
included in the paste formulation for the paste to have 
the appropriate flow or rheological characteristics. 
Particularly desirable rheological characteristics of 
the paste include high viscosity, which precludes 
separation or settling of the inorganic particulate in 
the paste, dripping, stringiness, and slumping or 
sagging; pseudoplasticity, which provides shear thinning 
for improved printing characteristic; sufficient 
tackiness to hold components; good transfer through the 
printing pattern; good print definition; and clean 
release from the screen or stencil. Effective amounts of rheology modifying agents, 
other organic ingredients, and acidic and/or basic 
activators, are typically so high that the organic 
ingredients leave a substantial residue on the solder 
after reflow. For example, rosin is typically present 
in a solder paste in the amount of 1 to 6 % by weight of 
the paste. This amount of rheology modifying agent 
leaves a substantial, readily visible and potentially 
detrimental solder-coating residue. It is necessary to wash off residues since the 
residues contain various ionic contaminants and other 
chemical agents
