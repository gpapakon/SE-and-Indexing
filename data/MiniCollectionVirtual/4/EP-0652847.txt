<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device movable arranged on carriers (11) for lifting and transporting large containers (19) of different outside dimensions, with an adjuster to match the distance between the securing components (17) to the distances between the lifting points on the large containers and a lifting mechanism (16). To minimise the height of the device's structure and for the sake of weight reduction and structural simplicity, it is proposed to fit two variably spaceable vertical guide columns (15) with lifting components (16) having a securing component (17) at their lower end either side of a lifting vehicle (13) movable on the carriers (11).
