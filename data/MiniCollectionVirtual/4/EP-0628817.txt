<ABSTRACT>
Detection of single-strand breaks in cellular DNA by 
incubating a sample comprising cells containing said DNA with 

an alkaline medium capable of releasing DNA from the cells and 
at least partially unwinding said DNA, and subjec
ting the 
alkaline medium-treated sample to a sandwich immunoassay using 

a monoclonal antibody directed against single-stranded DNA to 
determine the amount of single-stranded DNA therein. The 

method is particularly suited for estimating the quality of 
sperm of vertebrates. To allow a more accurate estimation of 

the number of single-strand breaks in the DNA, aliquots of the 
sample may be subjected to a pretreatment that induces single-strand 

breaks, such as irradiation with γ- or X-rays, using 
various doses to allow making a dose-effect curve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a test method for detecting 
single-strand breaks in DNA as contained in cells (cellular 
DNA), in particular sperm DNA in order to determine the sperm 
quality. The upkeep and improvement of the Dutch stock of 
cattle occurs almost exclusively by artificial insemination. 
The presence of the correct combination of genetic properties 
makes the sperm of a selected sire very valuable. Sperm 
quality decreases without doubt during freezing of the sperm 
in small portions. In addition, it appears that sperm-DNA 
contains large amounts of oxidative damage, possibly due to 
the absence of DNA repair and as a result of deficient 
feeding, or aging of the sperm in the animal. Sensitive immunochemical methods to analyse strand 
breaks (including alkali-labile sites) in DNA of sperm may be 
very useful to control sperm quality and to improve freeze-thawing 
procedures of the sperm. The methods may be valuable 
for the prediction of fertilization efficiency of the sperm. 
Also in pig- and horse-farming this method may be of value. 
Similarly, it may be of value to have a means to estimate the 
quality of the sperm of price-winning male mammals such as 
dogs and cats, or even male vertebrates such as pigeons and 
roosters. There may be also possibilities for application of 
the above-mentioned assays with regard to quality control of 
human sperm to be used for in vitro fertilization. After oocyte penetration the paternal contribution to 
the development potential of the conceptus depends entirely on 
the quality of the spermatozoon that penetrated, i.e. on the  
 
intrinsic sperm quality. Studies on sperm cell characteristics 
related to intrinsic sperm quality such as the degree of DNA 
condensation and the amount of DNA damage are relatively new 
and their predictive value for the probability of a successful 
gestation is not yet fully established. Evenson (1986) described flow cytometry of acridine 
orange-stained sperm as being a rapid and practical method for 
monitoring occupational exposure to genotoxicants. Evenson and 
Thompson (1992), applying this method, reported about a good 
correlation between the number of cells scored outside the 
main population in the flow cytogram and the decrease in 
fertility of 6 different boars. However, from this study it is 
not clear whether the deviation from the normal population is 
due to DNA damage or due to other changes. Fraga et al. (1991) demonstrated that human sperm DNA 
contains large amounts of oxidative DNA damage. They applied a
