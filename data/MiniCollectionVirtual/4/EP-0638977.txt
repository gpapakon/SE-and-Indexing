<ABSTRACT>
A covering tube (10) has a tubular sleeve section (12) made of 
a flexible electro-insulating material, and electro-insulating 

tubular sealing sections (14) provided at the ends of the 
sleeve sections (12). The sealing sections (14) include elastically 

shrinkable elements (16) formed integrally with the 
sleeve section (12), and core elements (18) arranged within 

the shrinkable elements (16) so as to hold the shrinkable elements 
(16) in an expanded state with a predetermined diameter. 

The elastically shrinkable elements (16) preferably are made 
of rubber materials having electro-insulation, high elastic 

recovery, and excellent elongation set properties. When the 
core elements (18) are removed upon being fitted to the connection, 

the elastically shrinkable elements (16) are brought 
into close contact with the outer surface of the cable sheaths 

due to an elastic recovery force of the shrinkable elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tube for covering a connection 
of electric wires, which is used for treating the connection 
of electric wires, such as a straight or branched connection, 
in a waterproofing, electrically insulating, and mechanically 
protecting manner. Conventionally, various methods have been used for covering 
the electric wires exposed in a connection of cables (coated 
electric wires), or of a cable and the other electro-conductive 
terminal member, for the purpose of waterproof, electro-insulation, 
and mechanical protection treatment. As a simplest 
method, the practice has been to affix a waterproof adhesive 
tape to the exposed electric wires in the connection. Another 
method has been also known, in which the connection is covered 
with a separate tubular member made of rubber or plastic, and 
the tubular member is fixed on the cable sheath while being 
sealed at the ends of the tubular member by a waterproof adhesive 
tape. These methods are simple and inexpensive, but it 
is difficult to perform uniform and stable treatment because 
of the fluctuation of the finished state of the affixed waterproof 
adhesive tape according to operators. Also, there is an 
occasion where the waterproof function of the waterproof adhesive 
tape is incomplete, and thus a reliable electro-insulating 
treatment cannot be performed. To easily and stably provide sufficient moisture resistance, 
electro-insulation, and mechanical protection properties to a 
connection of electric wires, a covering tube has been known, 
which comprises a tubular member having an inner diameter 
greater than an outer diameter of the connection and a length 
greater than that of the connection and which is arranged arranged 
while enveloping the connection and then shrunk by any  
 
ranged while enveloping the connection and then shrunk by any 
suitable means, thereby closely covering the connection due to 
the shrinkage force of the tube (hereinafter, this tube is referred 
to as a "shrinkable tube"). There are two kinds of such 
shrinkable tubes; a heat shrinkable tube comprising a tubular 
member made of a polymeric material having a high thermal 
shrinkability and shrunk by an external heat source (see Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 1-295614) and a 
cored elastic shrinkable tube comprising a tubular member made 
of a polymeric material having excellent elongation set properties, 
which is preliminarily expanded in its diameter in an 
elastic manner over the entire length thereof by a tubular

A tube for covering a connection of electric wires, comprising 
a tubular sleeve section (12) made of an electrical-insulating 

flexible material, and electrical-insulating 
tubular sealing sections (14) respectively provided 

at end portions of the sleeve section (12); said tube 
being fitted onto the connection of electric wires (28) 

in such a manner that the sleeve section (12) covers bare 
portions of the electric wires (28) in the connection and 

the sealing sections (14) surround cable sheaths (26) 
adjacent to the bare portions,characterized in that 

each of said sealing sections (14) comprises: 
an elastically shrinkable element (16) connected to each 

end portion of said sleeve section (12) and brought into 
close contact with an outer surface of the cable sheath 

(26) due to shrinkage force of said shrinkable element 
(16) caused by being elastically expanded; and 

a core element (18) arranged inside said elastically 
shrinkable element (16) so as to hold said shrinkable 

element (16) in an elastically expanded state in which an 
inner diameter of said shrinkable element ((16) is 

greater than an outer diameter of the cable sheath (26) 
and adapted to be removed when fitting said tube onto the 

connection.

defined in claim 1 or 2, wherein said sleeve section (12) 

is integrally molded with said elastically shrinkable 
element (16) of each sealing section (14). 
A tube for covering a connection of electric wires as 
defined in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein a minimum 

inner diameter of said sleeve section (12) is greater 
than a maxiumum outer diameter of the connection onto 

which the tube is fitted.
