<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method of 
mitigating gain peaking in optically amplified systems 
having application in long-haul transmission systems, 
networks and other optical communication systems. 
Specifically, the present invention is directed to 
maintaining adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and gain 
over a range of wavelengths, mainly those in which 
wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) optically amplified 
channels will be present. The method of the present 
invention achieves the desired results by using a chain of 
fiber amplifiers and pumping them at a predetermined 
wavelength to produce gain over a specified wavelength range 
covering the range of likely channels for WDM systems. There is considerable interest in using dense 
wavelength divison multiplexing (DWDM) and optical 
amplification (Nagel et al.) in optical networks, both for 
enhancing the capacity of existing long-haul optical 
networks or for achieving high capacity in future local area 
networks. One area of great concern is ensuring that, in 
systems containing concatenated chains of optical 
amplifiers, an adequate optical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 
is maintained over the range of wavelengths that the WDM 
channels will occupy. The problems of gain and/or SNR 
equalization have received considerable attention. K. 
Inoue, T. Kominato and H. Toba, "Tunable Gain Equalization 
using a Mach Zehnder Optical Filter in Multistage Fiber 
Amplifiers", IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, Vol. 3, 
1991, pp. 718-720, have approached the problem by using 
Fabry-Perot and Mach-Zehnder filters. A more useful and  
 
simpler technique of adjusting the power in each channel at 
the transmitters using information conveyed via telemetry 
was utilized by A.R. Chraplyvy, J.A. Nagel and R.W. Tkach, 
"Equalization in Amplified WDM Lightwave Transmission 
Systems", IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, Vol.4, 1992, pp 
920-922. While this technique works, it would clearly be 
preferable if it was unnecessary. It has recently been 
shown by E. Goldstein, V. daSilva, L. Eskilden, M. Andrejco 
and Y. Silberberg, "Inhomogeneously Broadened Fiber-Amplifier 
Cascade for Wavelength-Multiplexed Systems", IEEE 
Photonics Technology Letters, Vol. 5, 1993, pp.543-545, that 
a chain of amplifiers will produce a flatter gain profile if 
they are inhomogeneously broadened. However, this requires 
cooling the erbium-doped fibers to low temperatures. These 
studies have all dealt with erbium-doped fiber amplifiers 
pumped at a wavelength of 1480 nm.
