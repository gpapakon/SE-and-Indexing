grain oriented electrical steel sheet used as a core of 
electric appliances. When producing a grain oriented 

electrical steel sheet by heating a slab containing C, 
Si, acid-soluble Aℓ, N, not more than 0.014% of S+0.405 

Se and 0.05 to 0.8% of Mn and the balance consisting of 
Fe and unavoidable impurities at a temperature of less 

than 1,280°C, effecting hot rolling, applying cold 
rolling, decarbonization annealing and final finish 

annealing without annealing hot rolled sheet, the 
production method of the present invention controls the 

precipitation quantity of AℓN in the hot rolled sheet, 
controls the mean grain size of the primary 

crystallization grains from completion of decarbonization 
annealing to the start of final finish annealing, applies 

nitriding treatment after hot rolling but before the 
start of secondary recrystallization at final finish 

annealing, controls the hot rolling condition in 
accordance with the quantities of acid-soluble Aℓ and N 

of the slab, and further adds Sn.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a production method
for a grain oriented electrical steel sheet, having
excellent magnetic properties which can be used as the
core of transformer, etc.Grain-oriented electrical steel sheet has been
primarily used as the core material for transformers and
other electrical appliances, and must have excellent
magnetic properties such as excitation characteristics,
iron loss, and so forth. A flux density B8 at a magnetic
field intensity of 800 A/m is generally used as a
numerical value representing the excitation
characteristics. The iron loss W17/50 per kg when the
steel sheet is magnetized to 1.7 Tesla (T) at a frequency
of 50 Hz is used as a numerical value representing the
iron loss. The magnetic flux density has the largest
influence on the iron loss. Generally speaking, the
higher the magnetic flux density, the better the iron
loss. Generally, when the magnetic flux density is
increased, the secondary recrystallization grain tends to
be coarse, resulting in the inferior iron loss in some
case. To cope with this problem, the iron loss can be
improved by magnetic domain control irrespective of the
size of the secondary recrystallization grains.This known grain oriented electrical steel
sheet is produced by causing secondary recrystallization
in a final finish annealing step and developing a so-called
"goss texture" having a {110} axis in the
direction parallel to the steel sheet surface and a 〈001〉
axis in the rolling direction. To obtain particularly 
excellent magnetic properties, 〈001〉 as an easy axis of
magnetization must be aligned highly accurately with the
rolling direction.The production technology for such a grain
oriented electrical sheet with a high magnetization flux
density is typically disclosed in Japanese Examined
Patent Publication (Kokoku) Nos. 40-15644 and 51-13469
(corresponding to US-A-3287183 and US-A-3932234 respectively).
The former uses MnS and AℓN as the main inhibitors while
the latter uses MnS, MnSe, Sb, etc. In accordance with
the present state of the art, therefore, the sizes and
shapes of the precipitates functioning as these
inhibitors and their dispersion state must be
appropriately controlled. As to MnS, a method is
employed at present which produces a complete solid
solution of MnS at the time of heating a slab before hot
rolling, and allows it to precipitate at the time of hot
rolling. To produce a complete solid solution of MnS, in
an amount necessary for secondary recrystallization, a
temperature of about 1,400°C is necessary.This
