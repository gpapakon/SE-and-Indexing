<ABSTRACT>
A wire bondable plastic encapsulated semiconductor device 
(58) having no die supporting surface can be manufactured. In one 

embodiment, a semiconductor die (22) and a plurality of 
conductors (12) extending toward the periphery of the die are 

provided. The die is rigidly held in place on a workholder (60) 
with a vacuum (62) for the wire bonding process. Wire bonds (26) 

electrically connect the die to the conductors. The wire bonded 
die is then placed inside a mold cavity (64), and a resin 

encapsulated is transferred into the cavity under elevated 
temperature and pressure to form package body (70) around the 

die, the wire bonds and a portion of the conductors. Before the 
package body is formed, the die is supported solely by the the 

rigidity of the wire bonds since there is no die supporting surface 
connected to the conductors.

<DESCRIPTION>
Related subject matter is disclosed in U.S. Patent Number 
5,273,938 by Paul T. Lin et al., entitled "Resin Encapsulated 
Multichip Semiconductor Device and Method for Its Fabrication" 
assigned to the assignee hereof. This invention relates to a semiconductor device in general, 
and more specifically to a plastic encapsulated semiconductor 
device having no die supporting surface and a method for making 
the same. Plastic encapsulated semiconductor devices are susceptible 
to moisture ingress due to the permeable nature of plastic 
molding compounds. Devices containing moisture levels exceeding 
some critical amount run the risk of cracking or "popcorning" 
during the rapid heating of the solder reflow operation associated 
with board mounting of devices. Typically, the cracks begin at an 
interface within the package. FIG. 1 illustrates, in a top view, a 
typical leadframe 10 of the prior art. The leadframe 10 has a 
plurality of leads 12, a die supporting surface 14, and a plurality 
of tie bars 16 which physically connect the die supporting surface 
14 to the rest of the leadframe 10. The die supporting surface 14 
is also known as a flag, a die pad, or a die paddle in the art. The  
 
leadframe 10 is the framework for assembling a semiconductor 
device 20, as illustrated in FIG. 2. In FIG. 2 the semiconductor device 20 is illustrated in cross 
section so that the interfaces within the packaged device can be 
discussed. A semiconductor die 22 is mounted on die supporting 
surface 14 with a die attach adhesive 24. A plurality of wire 
bonds 26 electrically connect the semiconductor die 22 to the 
plurality of leads 12. The tie bars which physically connect the 
die supporting surface to the leadframe are not seen in this cross 
section. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the die supporting surface is 
downset below a plane as defined by the leads 12. This 
downsetting is typically done to aid in the symmetry of the 
plastic package body 28 in order to reduce stress within the 
packaged device. Plastic package body 28 is normally formed 
from transfer molding a resin encapsulant or mold compound, a 
process well known in the art. When a semiconductor device, such as the one illustrated in 
FIG. 2, cracks during a solder reflow operation normally 
associated with board mounting, the crack typically initiates at 
one of the interfaces 30, 32, or 34. Interface 30 is an interface 
between the backside of die supporting surface 14 and the mold 
compound of package body 28. Adhesion between the leadframe 
metal and
