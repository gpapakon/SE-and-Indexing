<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of the present invention is to develop a control with pulsed signals in such a way that excess heating is prevented and noteworthy interference is obviated. According to the invention, the edge steepness in a pulsed control signal is selected for a predetermined operating method and/or predetermined operating parameters like temperature or the like. The invention may be used, for instance, in a video recorder.

Method of controlling a power dissipating device (10) 
using pulsed signals which vary between a first value (U
h
) 
and a second value (U
l
) in correspondence with a 
predetermined edge slope (a, b), characterised in that, the 

edge slope is predetermined in dependence on a selected 
operating mode and/or in dependence on one or more operating 

parameters. 
Method in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, 
a first operating parameter is the temperature of a power 

output stage which is controlling the power dissipating 
device. 
Method in accordance with either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that, a second operating parameter is the 

current with which the power dissipating device is 
controlled. 
Method in accordance with any of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that, the power dissipating device is a 

drive motor for a video recorder and that the operating 
modes which serve for determining the edge slope are the 

operating modes of the video recorder such as the play back 
mode, recording mode, search mode, fast wind or the like. 
Device for controlling a power dissipating device (10) 
using pulsed signals which vary between a first value (U
h
) 
and a second value (U
l
) in correspondence with a  
 

predetermined edge slope (a, b), characterised in that, 
there are provided control means (12) which define the edge 

slope in dependence on a selected operating mode and/or in 
dependence on signals from sensor means (19, 20) which 

detect one or more operating parameters. 
Device in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that, 
a first sensor means (20) detects the temperature of a power 

output stage (18) which is controlling the power dissipating 
device (10). 
Device in accordance with either of Claims 5 or 6, 
characterised in that, second sensor means (19) are provided 

for detecting the current with which the power dissipating 
device is controlled or for detecting any sort of operating 

parameters whose values serve for determining the current. 
Device in accordance with any of the Claims 5 to 7, 
characterised in that, the power dissipating device is a 

drive motor (10) for a video recorder and that the operating 
modes which serve for determining the edge slope are the 

operating modes of the video recorder such as the play back 
mode, recording mode, search mode, fast wind or the like.
