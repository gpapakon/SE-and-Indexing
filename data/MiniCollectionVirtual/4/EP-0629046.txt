<ABSTRACT>
An electronic switch comprises a switch device (2) and 
an on-resistance (Ron) compensation feed-back controller 

(1). The Ron compensation feed-back controller (1) is able 
to bypass the current flow of the switch (2) to the Ron 

compensation feed-back controller (1) when the switch 
device is on. A further feature is the provision of an off 

resistance (Roff) enhancement circuit (3) to provide a 
higher off resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low-resistant high-speed 
electronic switch, especially to an electronic switch 
with very short reaction time and low Ron (The effective 
series resistance of a switch when it is in the ON state). 
According to this invention the reaction time of the low-resistance 
high-speed electronic switch may be several 
microseconds with its Ron of less than one milliohm. The 
switch of the present invention is suitable for electronic 
components used in precise instruments. It has been a development in electrical switching 
techniques to use electronic signals, in replacement of 
mechanical operation such as used in conventional relays, in 
the control of switch devices. Electronic switches, such as 
MOSFET switches, are welcomed by their users because of its 
compactness and short reaction time of several microseconds. 
Mechanical switches are, however, still commonly used by the 
industry, because they have lower Ron than electronic 
switches. In application the Ron of mechanical switches 
ranges about several milliohms but Ron of electronic 
switches ranges about several ohms. As a result, mechanical 
switches are always used in precise electronic circuits such  
 
as in the automatic control systems of precise measurement 
instruments, in spite of their longer reaction time (in 
milliseconds). It is thus a need of the industry to have an 
electronic switch which has lower on-resistance and shorter 
reaction time. In accordance with the present invention, an 
electronic switch comprises a switching device and a Ron 
compensation feed-back control circuit, wherein the Ron 
compensation feed-back control device bypasses the current 
flow of the switching device to the Ron compensation feed-back 
control device while the switching device is on. The 
most significant advantage of this invention is its low Ron 
and high reaction speed. With the help of the Ron 
compensation feed-back control circuit, the Ron of this 
invention may be reduced to several milliohms or less, with 
reaction time of about several microseconds. The invention provides a low-resistance high speed 
electronic switch with lower Ron and shorter reaction time. The invention also provides a low-resistance high-speed 
electronic switch with lower Ron and higher off-resistance 
(Roff). The invention also provides a low-resistance high-speed 
electronic switch which may be used in highly 
isolated environments. Preferably, the invention further comprises a Roff 
enhancement circuit and a highly isolated power
