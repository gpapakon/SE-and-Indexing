<ABSTRACT>
1) Chimeric gene for plant transformation. 2) It comprises at least, in the direction of transcription, a promoter region, a transgene and a termination region, characterised in that the termination region consists of at least one termination region of a plant histone gene which permits the expression of the protein in the regions of rapid growth. 3) Production of transgenic plants.
