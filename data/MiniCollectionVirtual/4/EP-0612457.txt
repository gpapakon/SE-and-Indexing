<ABSTRACT>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to systems and methods for storing digital video information on an optical recording medium comprising the steps of moving the optical recording medium in a first direction, sinusoidally scanning a beam of light over the moving optical recording medium in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first direction to establish a scan path over the optical recording medium, and periodically deflecting the sinusoidal scanning beam in the first direction to linearize at least a portion of the scan path. By linearizing at least a portion of the scan path, two traces can be made per cycle of a primary sinusoidal deflection, thereby doubling scanning efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to video recording and playback. More 
particularly, the invention relates to sinusoidal scanning systems and methods for optical 
writing and reading of data with respect to a storage medium such as a flexible optical 
tape. Presently, flexible tape for optical storage of data is known, as described in 
US-A-4,719,615 and 4,912,696, both identified on their faces as being assigned to 
Optical Data, Inc. To optically record data on a medium such as a flexible optical tape, 
a beam of laser light is directed onto the tape. The laser beam melts the tape or burns 
holes in the tape to produce data spots representing bits of data. The data spots have a 
reflectivity, transmissivity or other optical characteristic which can be distinguished from 
the background of the optical tape. Presently, optically sensitive tape has not been 
effectively used to record high frequency signals such as television video signals. Generally speaking, television pictures are comprised of snapshot-like "frames" 
that contain video signal information in horizontal scan lines organized by synchronizing 
signals. For example, according to the standards of the National Television Systems 
Committee (NTSC), each frame of video information comprises 525 horizontal scan lines. 
Further according to NTSC standards, the frame repetition rate is thirty frames per 
second, or 15,750 horizontal scan lines per second. In practice, all of the video information in a complete television frame is not 
reproduced at a receiver simultaneously; instead, a technique known as interlaced 
scanning is used to reduce flicker. In interlaced scanning, each frame of video 
information is divided into two interlaced fields, each comprising a raster array of 
odd-numbered or even-numbered horizontal scan lines. Thus, if the horizontal scan lines 
of a 525-line NTSC frame were numbered sequentially from the top of a raster array, an 
odd-line field would comprise numbered horizontal scan lines 1, 3, 5, and so forth 
through frame line 525. Similarly, an even-line field would include numbered lines 2, 4, 
and so forth through line 524. According to the NTSC format, the field repetition rate 
is sixty fields per second.  
 In video recording systems that employ magnetic videotape as the recording 
medium, it is conventional to record each television field by using only a single track on 
the recording medium. This single track is traced by a recording head which helically 
scans the recording medium. (Helical recording
