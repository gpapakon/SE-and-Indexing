<ABSTRACT>
Surgical trocar sleeves with movable, pivotable members and device for lateral pivoting, opening, spreading of attached platelets, rods, segments for use in surgery, especially in minimally invasive and intracorporeal endoscopic surgical interventions as multifunctional trocar sleeves for the insertion of endoscopes and instruments into the interior of the body and simultaneously for displacing, holding or lifting the organs, tissues and/or abdominal wall.

<CLAIMS>
A surgical trocar sleeve with moving, swivelling parts (1) and provided with a
mover which causes the lateral swivelling, spreading apart or opening of one or

more small plates, rods or segments (2) connected to it, for use in surgery, in
particular during minimally invasive and intracorporeal endoscopic surgical

operations as a multifunctional trocar sleeve through which endoscopes,
instruments and similar may be introduced into the interior of the body, and with

which organs, tissues or the abdomen wall may be displaced, held back or lifted,

the surgical trocar sleeve consists of an outer (3) and an inner (4) sleeve, wherein
the small plates, rods or segments (2) are connected to the distal part of the outer

( ) or inner (4) trocar sleeve, 
characterised in that
the outer (3) and inner (4) sleeve move independently of each other and freely
within each other, that
the small plates, rods and segments (2) are independent parts which are
connected in a hinge-like manner to the outer (3) or inner (4) trocar sleeve, and

that
adjusting the mover causes lateral swivelling by up to 90Â° of the small plates,
rods or segments (2) at the distal end of the trocar sleeve, due to relative motion

between the outer (3) and inner (4) trocar sleeve.
