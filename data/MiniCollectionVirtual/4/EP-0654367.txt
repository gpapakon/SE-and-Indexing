<ABSTRACT>
In a vehicle with air suspension, when a valve which serves for level control is switched off the vehicle does not remain directly at the level (N _ A) reached at the time (t _ A) when switching off occurs but rather reverberation of the change in the level takes place. The valve must therefore not be closed when the actual level (N _ IST) corresponds to the desired level (N _ SOLL) but rather the closing time (t _ V) must be positioned earlier. A device is disclosed which can precisely specify the closing time (t _ V) by virtue of the fact that it changes a previously known interrelation between a time period and an adjustment variable as a function of the respectively achieved success during a control process, i.e. as a function of the size of a deviation between the level actually achieved and the desired level (N _ SOLL). This change of the interrelation used permits the level (N _ E) reached with the control to be positioned nearer to the desired level (N _ SOLL) when the same adjustment conditions occur another time as are present during a current learning process.

Device for adjusting the level of a vehicle with
air suspension, which device is designed in such a way

that when adjustment is to take place to a new setpoint
level N_SETP the following steps relating to a valve

arrangement on a respective wheel with level adjustment
are carried out:


a) a valve which lets air out of a pneumatic spring or
blows air into it is opened in order to reach the

setpoint level starting from the actual level L_ACT;
b) the adjustment speed v_ST of the level adjustment is
measured;
c) as a function of a predetermined dependence between
the adjustment speed and a derivative-action time t_V,

the current value of the derivative-action time is
determined from the measured adjustment speed and a

derivative-action level difference is determined from
said current value in accordance with the relationship


ΔN_V = t_V·v_ST·G
, G being a weighting factor 
<
1, this
level difference being the value by which the valve must

be closed prematurely before the actual level is reached
so that the setpoint level should be obtained despite the

overshooting of the air suspension after the valve
closes; and
d) when a switch-off level 
N_OFF = N SETP-▵N_V
 in the
case of raising and 
N_OFF = N_SETP+▵N_V
 in the case of
lowering is reached, the valve is switched off;
e) after the valve is switched off, a final adjustment
speed v_OFF is determined when the valve is switched off;
f) as soon as the air suspension has come to rest, the 
final level n_E is measured and is compared with the

setpoint level N_SETP;
g) if the final level lies within a prescribed tolerance
range ΔN around the setpoint level, the procedure is

terminated, otherwise the following steps follow:
h) a correction derivative-action time 
Δt_V = (N_SETP-
N_E)/v_OFF
 is determined from the final adjustment speed
v_OFF and the level deviation N_SETP-N_E; and
h') in the previously known dependence of the derivative-action
time t_V on the adjustment speed v_ST, the value

of the derivative-action time which is associated with
the current value of the adjustment speed is then

corrected by the correction derivative-action time Δt_V.
Device for adjusting the level of a vehicle with
air suspension, which device is designed in such a way

that when adjustment is to take place to a new setpoint
level N_SETP the following steps relating to a valve

arrangement on a respective wheel with level adjustement
are carried out:


a) it is investigated whether the difference 
D_SETP =
N_SETP-N_ACT
 between the actual level N_ACT and the
setpoint level N_SETP is greater in absolute terms than

a critical difference D_CRIT, and if this is the case,
said device then carries out the following steps b) to e)

while otherwise it carries out the step f:
b) a valve which lets air out of a pneumatic spring
device or blows air into it is opened, in order to reach

the setpoint level starting from the actual level N_ACT;
c) the adjustment speed v_ST of the level adjustment is
measured;
d) as a function of a predetermined dependence between
the adjustment speed and a derivative-action time t_V,

the current value of the derivative-action time is
determined from the measured adjustment speed and a

derivative-action level difference is determined from
said current value in accordance with the relationship


ΔN_V = t_V·v_ST·G
, G being a weighting factor 
<
1, this
level difference being the value by which the valve must

be closed prematurely before the actual level is reached 
so that the setpoint level should be obtained despite the

overshooting of the air suspension after the valve
closes; and
e) when a switch-off level 
N_OFF = N_SETP-▵N_V
 in the
case of raising and 
N_OFF = N_SETP+▵N_V
 in the case of
lowering is reached, the valve is switched off;
f) the current value of the valve-opening time, which is
to be used to overcome the setpoint difference, is

determined from the difference D_SETP from a previously
known dependence between the setpoint interval D_SETP and

a valve-opening time t_OP, and the valve which is
responsible for adjusting the setpoint level is opened

for the currently determined valve-opening time t_OP.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that it is designed in such a way that it carries out the

following steps after step ii):

iii) as soon as the air suspension has come to rest after
the valve has closed, the final level N_E which has been

reached is measured;
iv) the final level is compared with the setpoint level
and if the final level lies within a prescribed tolerance

ΔN around the setpoint level, the device terminates the
adjustment procedure while otherwise it carries out the

following steps:
v) an opening time 
t_REQ = t_OP·(D_SETP/D_ACT)
, which
would actually be required in order to overcome the

setpoint difference D_SETP, is determined from the
difference 
D_ACT = N_E-N_ACT
 which is achieved between
the final level N_E and the original actual level N_ACT,

the setpoint difference D_SETP and the opening time t_OP
which is used; and
vi) in the previously known dependence, used in step ii),
of the opening time t_OP on the setpoint difference

D_SETP, the value of t_OP which is associated with the
current value of D_SETP is replaced by the value t_REQ.
Device according to one of Claims 2 or 3,
characterized in that it is designed in such a way that

it uses two different values for the critical interval
D_CRIT in step i), specifically a smaller value for 

D_SETP 
>
 0 (raising) and a larger value for D_SETP 
<
 0
(lowering).
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that the device is designed in such a

way that if, in step i), it makes the decision to execute
steps a) to d), it carries out not only these steps but

also steps e) to h') of Claim 1.
Device according to Claim 1 or Claim 3,
characterized in that it has a memory (Backup RAM), which

stores the variable dependences known from steps h') and
vi).
