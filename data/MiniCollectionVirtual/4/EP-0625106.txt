Slip-controlled hydraulic brake system having at least 
two wheel brakes (9, 10) and an auxiliary-pressure source (17), 

wherein pressure fluid can be supplied from the 
auxiliary-pressure source (12) to the wheel brakes (9, 10) by 

means of one inlet valve (7, 8), respectively, and wherein a 
differential pressure limiter (20) is interposed between the 

auxiliary-pressure source (17) and the inlet valves (7, 8) 
permitting rise of the pressure supplied from the 

auxiliary-pressure source (22) to the inlet valves (7, 8) in 
excess of the pressure prevailing in the wheel brakes (9, 10) 

only by a predetermined amount,
characterized
 in that for all wheel brakes (9, 10) 
one joint differential pressure limiter (20) is provided, and in 

that from each wheel brake (9, 10) one control line (25, 26) 
leads to a pressure selector (24) which delivers one of the 

wheel braking pressures as a reference pressure to the 
differential pressure limiter (20). 
Slip-controlled hydraulic brake system as claimed in 
claim 1,
characterized
 in that the pressure selector (24) 
is a piston-and-cylinder assembly which delivers in each case 

the lowest of the pressures prevailing in the control lines (25, 
26) to the differential pressure limiter (20). 
Slip-controlled hydraulic brake system as claimed in 
claim 1,
characterized
 in that the pressure selector 
(Figure 3) is a piston-and-cylinder assembly which delivers in 

each case the highest of the pressures prevailing in the control  
 

lines (25, 26) to the differential pressure limiter. 
Slip-controlled hydraulic brake system as claimed in any 
one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the auxiliary-pressure 

source is a pressure accumulator (22) which can be filled by a 
pump (17) through an accumulator line (19), the differential 

pressure limiter (20) being arranged in the accumulator line 
(19). 
Slip-controlled hydraulic brake system as claimed in any 
one of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the differential pressure 
limiter (20) in a bore (32) includes an axially slidable stepped 

piston (35) which, at its small and its large periphery, is 
respectively sealed in relation to the bore wall, 


in that the seals (36, 37) confine a control chamber (40) at the 
piston end of small cross-section, a first chamber (38) at the 

piston end of larger cross-section and a second chamber (39) 
between the seals, 
in that a valve (41, 42) is interposed between the first and the 
second chamber and closes when the piston (35) moves towards the 

control chamber (45), and in that, in the valve's opening 
direction, the piston (35) is acted upon by a compression spring 

(44) arranged in the control chamber (40).
