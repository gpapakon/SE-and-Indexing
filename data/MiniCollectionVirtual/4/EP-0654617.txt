<ABSTRACT>
Elastic articulation with controlled axial stiffness, of the type including an internal reinforcing member 12 with an asymmetric external surface and a coaxial tubular external reinforcing member 13 surrounding the said internal reinforcing member, a mass of elastic substance 14 being bonded between the facing annular surfaces of these two reinforcing members, characterised in that the said annular surfaces have undulations (waves) 16, 17, in at least one axial plane.

Elastic pivot with controlled axial stiffness, of the 
type comprising an inner frame (12) with outer revolving 

surface and an outer coaxial tubular frame (13) enclosing 
the said inner frame, a mass of elastic material (14) being 

contained between the facing annular surfaces of these two 
frames, the said annular surfaces having undulations (16,17) 

in at least one axial plane, characterised in that the said 
mass of elastic material (14) adheres between the said 

annular surfaces and in that the minimum diameter (d2) of 
the undulations (17) of the outer frame (13) is less than 

the maximum diameter (dl) of the undulations (16) of the 
inner frame (12). 
Pivot according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
thickness of the said mass of elastic material (14) is 

variable in the axial direction, increasing from the central 
part towards the ends. 
Pivot according to claim 1 or 2 characterised in that a 
pretension of the said mass (14) during assembly is 

obtained, after moulding between the said frames (13,14), 
through hammer-shaping of the outer frame (13). 
Pivot according to claim 1 or 2 characterised in that a 
pretension of the said mass (14) during assembly is obtained 

through moulding same between the inner frame (12) and an 
outer frame (13) which comprises housings (13a,13b) whose 

edges (15) are in a slightly spaced relative position and 
then brought close together and fixed for example by 

soldering.
