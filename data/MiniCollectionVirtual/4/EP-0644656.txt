<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to transistor circuits, and more
particularly to transistor circuits with a terminal receiving
predetermined high voltages and electrical signals.A typical conventional transistor circuitry with the terminal
for receiving both the high voltage and the electrical signals
will be described with reference to FIG. 1. The transistor
circuitry has on input terminal 1 for receiving both the high
voltage and the electrical signals, a signal output terminal 5
from which electrical signals are outputted and a high voltage
output terminal 3 from which a high voltage is outputted. The
transistor circuitry also has an input circuit 2 that is
electrically connected in series between the input terminal 1 
and the signal output terminal 5 for receiving the electrical
signals from the input terminal 1 and subsequent supply of the
output signals to the signal output terminal 5. The transistor
circuitry further has a n-channel transistor 6 that is
electrically connected between the input terminal 1 and the high
voltage output terminal 3. The n-channel transistor 6 has a gate
to which a control signal is applied, according to which the
transistor 6 shows switching operations. The n-channel
transistor has a substrate that is grounded.Operations of the conventional transistor circuitry will
subsequently be described. The n-channel transistor 6 serves as
a switch. When the input terminal 1 receives a high voltage, the
control signal is in a high level to be applied to the gate
electrode 4 to have the switching transistor 6 turn on so that
the high voltage that has been received by the input terminal 1
is transmitted through the switching transistor 6 to the high
voltage output terminal 3. By contrast, when the input terminal
1 receives electrical signals the control signal is in a low
level o be applied to the gate electrode 4 to have the switching
transistor 6 turn off so that the electrical signals are
supplied into the input circuit 2 and subsequent output of
signals from the signal output terminal 5.The above described conventional transistor circuitry has a
serious problem as described below. The above circuitry requires
that the n-channel switching transistor is designed to have a considerable large channel width for an appreciable reduction of a voltage drop caused by the switching transistor. The large channel width of the switching transistor 6 provides a large occupation area of the switching transistor. This provides a difficulty in achieving a high density integration of the transistor
