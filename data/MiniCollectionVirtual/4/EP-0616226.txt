<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates especially to a system for monitoring the ageing of a battery (30) formed by a plurality of elements (32) connected in series and accepting complete discharge, this system being characterised in that it includes:   - discharging means (33) capable of discharging, one at a time, only one of the previously charged elements (32) down to an end-of-discharge value; - means (35) for measuring the quantity of electricity delivered by each discharged element (32), while it is being discharged; - means (35) for using the quantity of electricity delivered by at least one discharged element (32), these means being capable of detecting excessive ageing of the battery (30).   Excessive ageing of the battery is especially manifested by a residual capacity less than a fraction of the nominal capacity of this battery.
