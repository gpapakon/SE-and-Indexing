<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an agricultural machine intended to be connected to a motor vehicle. The agricultural machine (1) according to the invention is characterised in that   - the supply circuit (26) includes at least one supply distributor (27) making it possible to supply the operating device (25); - the control circuit (30) includes at least one timer used to drive the feed distributor (27) during a predetermined span of time; and - right from the moment where the user gives, or has given, an impulse to an impulse-type control member, the control circuit (30) automatically drives the feed circuit (26) of the operating device (25), so as to bring the said agricultural machine (1) from a first position into a second position.

51; 71) from a first position into a second position;
a supply circuit (26; 59; 72) comprising at least one supply distributor (27;
54, 55) allowing the operating member(s) (7, 17) of the corresponding

operating device (25; 52, 53) to be supplied from a powering source (40;
61); and
a control circuit (30; 62; 90) controlling the supply circuit (26; 59; 72) and
equipped with a control member (34) by means of which the user acts on

the supply circuit (26; 59; 72) from the motor vehicle (2; 60);
characterized in
 that:
the control circuit (30; 62; 90) comprises at least one timer (T1, T2, T3 ...)
used to control the supply distributor (27; 54, 55) for a corresponding

predetermined operating time (t1, t2, t3...);
the control member (34) is an impulse-type control member which means
that right from the moment that the user gives or has given an impulse to

the control member (34), the control circuit (30; 62; 90) automatically
controls the supply circuit (26; 59; 72) of the corresponding operating

device(s) (25; 52, 53) in order to bring the said agricultural machine (1; 51;
71) from its first position into its second position.
Agricultural machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the control
circuit (30; 62; 90) comprises at least two timers (T1, T2, T3 ...) and that the

second timer (T2) starts at least approximately when the first operating time
(t1) has elapsed, so that the supply distributor (27; 54, 55) is controlled

differently or so that a different supply distributor (27; 54, 55) is controlled. 
Agricultural machine according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
 that the
operating times (t1, t2, t3...) of the timers (T1, T2, T3 ...) can be lengthened

or shortened by means of a centralized adjusting element (82).
Agricultural machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in

that the operating time (t1, t2, t3 ...) of each timer (T1, T2, T3 ...) can be
adjusted by means of a respective adjusting element (77, 78, 79, 80, 81).
Agricultural machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in

that the control circuit (30; 62; 90) comprises elements (28', 36, 29'; 57', 65,
56', 66, 58') intended to be situated on the motor vehicle (2; 60) close to the

user and indicating to him the progress through the cycle.
Agricultural machine according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
 that the said
elements (28', 36, 29'; 57', 65, 56', 66, 58') are lamps which light up in turn

as the cycle progresses.
Agricultural machine according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in

that:

each supply distributor (27'; 54, 55) comprises an electrical control (28, 29;
56, 57, 58); and
the control circuit (30; 62; 90) comprises a control unit (31; 63; 74)
intended to be situated on the motor vehicle (2; 60) and electrical cables

(38', 38; 83, 84, 85) connecting the said electrical control(s) (28, 29; 56,
57, 58) to the said control unit (31; 63; 74).
Agricultural machine according to Claim 7, 
characterized in
 that the said
electrical cables (83, 84, 85, 86) are connected to the control unit (74) by

means of a connector (87). 
Agricultural machine according to Claim 7 or 8,
