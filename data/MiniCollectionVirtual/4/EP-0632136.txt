<ABSTRACT>
A connecting structure of a blast furnace hot stove 
of the type in which a heat accumulation chamber dome and 

a combustion chamber dome are directly connected to each 
other through a dome connecting pipe which does not have 

any expansion joint. The ratio (RD/TD) of the diameter 
(RD) of the dome connecting pipe to the diameter (TD) of 

the heat accumulation chamber dome approximately meets the 
condition wherein 0.24 ≦ (RD/TD) ≦ 0.60, while the ratio 

(RD/ND) of the diameter (RD) of the dome connecting pipe 
to the diameter (ND) of the combustion chamber dome 

approximately meets the condition wherein 0.44 ≦ (RD/ND) ≦ 
0.80. The connecting structure may have a reinforcement 

ring provided on straight barrel portions immediately 
under the heat accumulation chamber dome and the 

combustion chamber barrel, and a connecting beam may be 
fixed at one end to one of the reinforcement rings and 

engage at its other end with the other of the 
reinforcement rings for limited sliding motion. The 

connecting structure may further have a reinforcement 
member provided in each of the regions where the dome 

connecting pipe is connected to the heat accumulation 
chamber dome and the combustion chamber dome.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in a
dome connecting structure of an external-combustion hot
stove which is annexed to a blast furnace.More particularly, the present invention is
concerned with a structure for mounting a dome connecting
member which interconnects separate domes constituting a
combustion chamber and a heat accumulation chamber and
which does not incorporate any expansion joint.In general, hot stoves for stably supplying hot air
at high temperature to a blast furnace have a combustion
chamber and a heat accumulation chamber. Hot stoves can
broadly be sorted into two types: (a) internal combustion
type hot stoves in which the combustion chamber and the
heat accumulation chamber are consolidated and (b)
external combustion type hot stoves in which these
chambers are arranged separately from each other.The external combustion type is becoming dominant in
pace with the current trend for greater scales or sizes of
blast furnaces.Hot stoves of the external combustion type employ a
combustion chamber into which blast furnace gas or coke
oven gas is introduced to be burnt therein, and also 
employ a heat accumulation chamber in which the heat
generated by the combustion is accumulated. These
chambers are interconnected through a furnace top dome so
as to enable accumulation of heat and supply of hot gas to
the blast furnace.A conventional connecting structure known as the
Koppers type structure employs a straight connecting pipe
which interconnects the side walls of a heat accumulation
chamber dome and a combustion chamber dome and which
incorporates an expansion joint. This type of connecting
structure is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Nos. 50-104707 and 53-131906, as well as in
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 55-4285.Fig. 9 of the drawings shows an example of a hot
stove of the Koppers type. This hot stove, denoted by the
number 12, has a heat accumulation chamber 1 which is of
the self-standing type, and has a combustion chamber 2
situated on a column 3. A dome 9 on the heat accumulation
chamber 1 and a dome 10 on the combustion chamber 2 are
connected to each other through a dome connecting pipe 4
having an expansion joint 5. When supplying hot gas, an
axial force of about 1000 tons acts due to pressure of the
gas, tending to move domes 9, 10 away from each other. In
order to prevent excessive expansion of the expansion
joint 5, therefore, both the heat accumulation chamber
dome 9 and the combustion chamber dome 10 are provided
with dome ring
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
