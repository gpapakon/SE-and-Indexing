<ABSTRACT>
In a progressive multifocal lens of the present 
invention, the horizontal sectional shape of a 

refracting surface of the lower portion of a farsight 
portion defines a non-circular arc in which a 

horizontal section curvature is increased and then 
decreased as being away from an intersecting point with 

the principal meridional curve along a horizontal 
crossing curve, the horizontal sectional shape of a 

refracting surface of the upper portion of a nearsight 
portion defines a non-circular arc in which a 

horizontal section curvature is decreased and then made 
approximately constant as being away from an 

intersecting point with the meridional curve along a 
horizontal crossing curve, the gradient of the decrease 

of a horizontal section curvature is approximately 
constant from the upper portion of the nearsight 

portion to the lower portion thereof, the horizontal 
sectional shape of a refracting surface of the center 

of an intermediate portion in which a horizontal 
section curvature is decreased as being away from an 

intersecting point with the principal meridional curve 
along a horizontal crossing curve, and the gradient of 

the decrease of a horizontal section curvature is 
increased as approaching the nearsight portion from the 

center of the intermediate portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a progressive
multifocal lens used to assist an accommodation power
of an eye.As spectacle lenses for assisting an
accommodation power when an accommodation power of an
eye becomes too weak to see a near point, various
progressive multifocal lenses have been known. A
progressive multifocal lens of this type has a
"farsight portion", a "nearsight portion" and a
progressive region (referred to as an "intermediate
portion" hereinafter) which is located between the
above two portions in which a refracting power is
continuously changed. When the progressive multifocal
lens is actually worn as spectacles by a user, the
farsight portion becomes an upper portion while the
nearsight portion becomes a lower portion. In the
present invention, it is to be noted that "upper
portion", "lower portion", "horizontal" and "vertical"
are used to point positions of the progressive
multifocal lens in the state that it is actually worn
by the user. For example, the lower portion of the
farsight portion is a position within the farsight 
portion close to the intermediate portion. Also, the
difference between the nearsight refracting power and
the farsight refracting power is called an additional
power.In a progressive multifocal lens of this type,
in general, when wide distinct vision areas (ranges
with an astigmatic difference of 0.5 diopter or less)
of the farsight and nearsight portions are kept and
coupled by the progressive power range, lens
aberrations are concentrated on side regions of the
progressive power range. As a result, blurring and
distortion of an image occur in these side portions.
Therefore, when a user wears spectacles formed of these
multifocal lenses and shifts his eyes laterally, he
perceives the distortion of an image as the fluctuation
of the image and has an unpleasant feeling.In order to prevent such a problem of visual
characteristics, in known progressive multifocal lenses,
various designs and evaluations have been made from a
variety of viewpoints. As for the shape of a lens
surface, an intersecting line (principal meridional
curve) defined by a section extending along a vertical
meridian vertically passing through substantially the
center of a lens surface and an object-side lens
surface is used as a reference curve for expressing
specifications such as an additional power of a lens,
and is also used as an important reference curve in a 
lens design.As shown in Fig. 1, a progressive multifocal
lens (hereinafter referred to as an asymmetrical
progressive

A progressive multifocal lens comprising, along a principal meridional
curve (MM'), a farsight portion (F) having a refracting power

corresponding to a distant view, a nearsight portion (N) having a refracting
power corresponding to a near view, and an intermediate (P) portion,

located between said farsight and nearsight portions (F, N), for
continuously connecting said refracting powers of the farsight and

nearsight portions (F, N), and wherein

a horizontal sectional shape of a refracting surface of a lower portion of
said farsight portion (F) defines a non-circular arc in which a horizontal

section curvature is increased and then decreased as being away from an
intersecting point with said principal meridional curve (MM') along a

horizontal crossing curve,

said nearsight portion (N) defines a non-circular arc in which a horizontal

section curvature is decreased and then made approximately constant
within 3% as being away from an intersecting line with said principal

meridional curve (MM') along a horizontal crossing curve,

curve along a horizontal crossing curve, and

the gradient of decrease of a horizontal section curvature is increased as
approaching said nearsight portion (N) from the center of said intermediate 

portion (P), wherein
