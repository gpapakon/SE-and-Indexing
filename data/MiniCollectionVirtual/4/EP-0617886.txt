<ABSTRACT>
Surface of cheese curd is tightly covered with a 
sheet of film before ripening to avoid growth of molds 

and aerobic bacteria on the surface as well as injury 
of its palatability. The film may be air-impermeable 

or adapted to pass enzymes and a part of hyphae but not 
spores and most of bacteria therethrough. If a part of 

cut ends thereof is tightly covered with film of the 
former type, molds and aerobic bacteria will grow on 

the remaining paked surface so as to avoid melting 
together of cut ends even after the pieces of cheese 

have been assembled together again and subjected to the 
ripening or the heating. The film may be fed onto a 

cheese piece line-up machine provided with a member 
having configuration corresponding to the configuration 

in which the initial lump of cheese is to be cut, under 
an effect of suction from below, to facilitate the cut 

ends of the respective cheese pieces to be covered with 
the film. 
 
Film of the latter type is preferably netty, 
aventurine or fibriform. Outer surface of such film 

may be sprayed with aerobic bacteria to achieve the 
ripening cheese. Molds and aerobic bacteria grow on 

the surface of film but not on the surface of cheese.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
manufacturing cheese free from molds and aerobic bacteria
which otherwise would grow and increase on a surface
of cheese, in which the surface of cheese is air-tightly
covered with a sheet of film and thereby said
molds and aerobic bacteria are prevented from growing
and increasing on the surface of cheese. A process having the
features as set forth in the preamble portion of claim 1 is
known for example from EP-A-0,418,977.Natural cheese, particularly Camembert cheese
and Limburger cheese have usually been manufactured by
letting molds and aerobic bacteria grow and increase on
the surface of cheese to achieve ripening of curd.Certain steps included in the conventional
manufacturing process, for example, the step of decomposing
protein and fat utilizing eumycetes such as
molds, aerobic bacteria and the like has inevitably led
not only to generation of foul smell or discoloration
but also to formation of an undesirable layer comprising
microorganisms such as molds and aerobic bacteria
on the surface of cheese. Usually, the consumer has
scraped or washed such unnecessary layer off and then
eaten only remaining cheese. Consequently, a significant
net quantity loss of the merchandise combined with
residual foul smell has been a serious obstacle to 
achieve a desired marketability of such cheese having
its surface covered with the layer of microorganisms.
According to the conventional process of manufacturing,
it has been impossible to propagate molds and aerobic
bacteria locally on desired location or desired portion
and they have been reluctantly propagated all over the
surface of cheese. Removal of said undesirable molds
and eumycetes forming the layer of microorganisms has
required cumbersome operation of washing off or scraping
off and, even after such operation, foul smell has
sometimes remained on the surface of cheese, so the
portion likely taking part in generation of such foul
smell also have had to be removed. While such layer of
microorganisms comprising eumycetes, for example, molds
and aerobic bacteria is useful for manufacturing of
cheese (this layer is known as "mat" in the technical
field of Camembert cheese), this layer has often been
disliked by consumers depending on individual's taste
and, in order to be marketable, such molds and aerobic
bacteria have had to be removed from the surface of
cheese.Cheese is generally classified into natural
cheese and process cheese, both of which have usually
been placed on the market in the form of

<CLAIMS>
Process for manufacturing cheese wherein cheese curd (25) is wholly or
partially covered with a sheet of film (22, 24) before ripening in such a way that a

close contact between the sheet of film (22, 24) and the cheese curd (25) is
ensured, said process being characterized in that said sheet of film (22, 24) is a

netty, aventurine or fibriform film having interstice in the order of 5 to 900 Âµm and
in that the outer surface thereof is inoculated with aerobic bacteria by spraying or

direct coating before ripening.
Process according to claim 1 wherein top and bottom of cheese curd are
covered with the sheet of film (22, 24).
Process according to any of claims 1 and 2 wherein parts of cheese curd
which have not been covered with said sheet of film are covered with air-impermeable

material (21).
Process according to claim 3 wherein top and bottom of cheese curd are
covered with air-impermeable material (21) and the lateral surface of cheese

curd is coated with said sheet of film (22, 24).
Apparatus used in the process for manufacturing cheese according to
claim 1, said apparatus comprising a cheese piece line-up machine (12) provided on

its top surface with a member (13) of a predetermined configuration suitable for
receiving cheese pieces cut from an initial cheese lump and adapted to be under

an effect of suction from below, a film feeder (14) and a cheese feeder so that the film
feeder places a sheet of film on said configurated member provided on the top

surface of the cheese piece line-up machine, then said sheet of film comes in
close contact with this configurated member under the effect of suction from

below so as to be molded according to the predetermined configuration of said

member, cheese pieces previously molded in a configuration corresponding to
said configuration of said member provided on the top surface of the cheese

piece line-up machine are fed by the cheese feeder onto said molded film and
thereby surfaces of the respective cheese pieces are tightly covered with said

sheet of film.
