<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for controlling bacterial growth in a fluid by treatment thereof with bactericidal radiation wherein the fluid, such as water, is used as a coolant for a source (3) of radiation but has a flow rate which is insufficient to maintain the source (3) at a sufficiently low working temperature for the generation of bactericidal radiation thereby, wherein the apparatus comprises a radiation source (3) which is capable of generating bactericidal radiation at a given working temperature or within a give working temperature range and is arranged to enable the fluid to be treated with bactericidal radiation and to effect cooling of the source (3) and where in the apparatus further comprises means (20) arranged to operate the radiation source intermittently to maintain its working temperature at a given temperature or within a given temperature range at which bactericidal radiation is generated thereby. The invention has particular application in humidification systems for serve-over, point-of-sale food and/or floral display cabinets.

<DESCRIPTION>
BACTERIAL CONTROLDESCRIPTIONThis invention relates to the control of bacterial growth in a fluid and to apparatus for exercising such control, the apparatus comprising a source of radiation for treating the fluid in which bacterial growth is to be controlled, with the fluid acting as a coolant for the source.Throughout this specification, the word "control", and its various derivatives, is used in relation to bacteria to mean not only the inhibition of the growth of existing colonies of bacteria but also the destruction thereof, as the case may be.Under normal operating conditions, the rate of flow of coolant fluid is sufficient to maintain the temperature of the radiation source at a given level or within a given range, whereby the wavelength of the radiation is such as to possess bacteriacidal properties. If the temperature of the radiation source changes during usage, for instance, due to a reduction in the flow rate of the coolant fluid being treated, such that there is insufficient cooling of the source to maintain it at the given temperature or within the given range of temperatures at which the radiation wavelength possesses bacteriacidal properties, then the wavelength of the radiation will change accordingly, such that it does not possess bacteriacidal properties. As a consequence, control of bacterial growth and activity within the coolant fluid can be diminished seriously. 

 This invention is particularly suited for use in humidification systems associated with point-of-sale display cabinets or service cases containing food products, such as, meat, dairy products, fish, fresh vegetables and fruit and similar products, as well as fresh flowers, being displayed therein.In known point-of-sale humidification systems of this type, such as, that disclosed in published British Patent Application No. 2258299A, a mixture of moisture and air, preferably, water vapour-saturated air, is injected into the atmosphere in which food and/or floral products are displayed at point-of-sale in the cabinet or service case. Bacterial growth can occur on components of the humidification system, such as, the moisture/air mixture injection nozzles. As a result, and particularly when the humidifying moisture/air mixture is injected at intermittent intervals into the associated atmosphere resulting in a substantial reduction in the rate at which water flows to the air mixer and injection nozzle, bacterial growth can extend upstream of the nozzle and into the very water supply itself.Attempts have been made to overcome
