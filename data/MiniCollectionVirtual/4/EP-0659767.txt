<ABSTRACT>
An anti-D immunoglobulin G product is prepared from plasma containing human anti-D IgG or a plasma fraction containing anti-D IgG by   A) subjecting the plasma or plasma fraction at a pH in the range from 3.5 to 6.5 to an ion exchange chromatography using an adsorbent which has carboxymethyl groups as functional groups, with the anti-D IgG being bound to the adsorbent, B) washing the adsorbent with bound anti-D IgG using a washing solution, and subsequently eluting the anti-D IgG, and further C) treating the eluted anti-D IgG with a basic adsorbent with ion exchange properties in order to bind unwanted components, and finally concentrating the anti-D IgG.   The non-infectious anti-D concentrate is obtained in good yield and has a specific activity of more than 0.5% anti-D IgG per gram of total IgG.

<CLAIMS>
Method of producing an anti-D immunoglobulin G-preparation with a specific
activity of more than 0.5% anti-D IgG per gram total IgG, from human

plasma, 
characterised in that
 plasma or an anti-D IgG containing plasma
fraction from rhesus negative blood of rhesus factor D sensitised donors:


A) with a pH value in the range of pH 3.5 to 6.5 is subjected to an ion
exchange chromatography, with an adsorbent which has carboxymethyl

groups as functional groups, the anti-D IgG being bound to the
adsorbent,
B) the adsorbent with the bound anti-D IgG is first rinsed with a wash
solution, and the anti-D IgG is subsequently eluted, and further
C) the eluted anti-D IgG is treated with an alkaline adsorbent with ion-exchange
characteristics in order to bind undesired components, and

finally the anti-D IgG is concentrated.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the anti-D IgG is concentrated
in stage C), 
in that
 steps A) and B) are repeated at least once.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 used as the starting
material is plasma which has been pre-treated with a basic adsorbent with

ion-exchange characteristics in order to bind undesired components.
Method according to claim 1 or 2 
characterised in that
 the protease content in
the plasma or in the plasma fraction is reduced through incubation with an

adsorbent such as aluminium hydroxide gel.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 all ion
exchange chromatography steps, and if necessary further adsorption steps,

are carried out alternatively as batch chromatography, column chromatography
or membrane chromatography.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the
alkaline adsorbent in step C) has diethylaminoethyl groups as functional

groups.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the elution
in step B) is carried out with pH shift and/or change of the buffer composition, 

for example by changing its ionic concentration or conductivity,
respectively.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 it comprises
at least one step of virus inactivation.
Method according to claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the step of virus inactivation
comprises treatment of the plasma or of the fraction containing anti-D IgG

with a detergent and tri(n-butyl) phosphate, the phases of the mixture
containing solvent and detergent being separated and the clear lower phase

being used.
Method according to claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the step of virus inactivation
is a heat treatment.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 the
starting plasma or the starting plasma fraction prior to the ion exchange

chromatography step in stage A) is subjected to at least one of the steps
mentioned in the following:


a) freezing the plasma, the cryoprecipitate being separated by filtration
and/or centrifugation after thawing and before its further use
b) treatment with a solvent-detergent-mixture, incubation at approximately
37Â° C and phase separation.
