<ABSTRACT>
There is provided an electrically connecting structure of a 
semiconductor device and a method for forming such connecting structures 

that allow the reliable and easy electrical connection and simultaneous 
mechanical connection of a tab on a substrate having an IC chip mounted 

thereon to an electrode on the printed circuit board by using a 
plurality of fine lead wires. 
A lead wire 120 is fixed at three portions, (the top, the side, and the 
bottom) of the substrate 100 with resin tapes 130, 132, and 134. The 

lead wire 120, when fixed on the substrate, is bent in such a manner 
that the lead wire 120 has a curved projection that projects from a 

plane coplanar with the bottom of the substrate. At this projection, 
the lead wire 120 is electrically connected to an electrode 115 on the 

printed circuit board 110 with solder or a conductive bonding agent 140. 
At the same time, the substrate and the printed circuit board are 

mechanically connected with each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical connecting structures for a 
semiconductor device and to methods for forming such connecting 
structures, and more particularly to a structure for electrically 
connecting an electrode on a substrate having an IC chip mounted thereon 
to an electrode on a printed circuit board for carrying the substrate. Highly integrated IC chips such as LSI's and VLSI's are usually 
electrically connected to the electrode on a substrate with wire bonding 
or flip chip bonding, and disposed on the substrate. Figure 5 is a view 
showing one example of a substrate having an IC chip placed thereon. 
The substrate 40 is generally referred to as a module substrate. On a 
thin plate having resin, ceramic, or metal as the base, a wiring pattern 
including an electrode for an IC chip 50 is formed. The wiring pattern 
on the substrate has an electrode group 70, usually called a "tab," 
which surrounds the periphery of substrate. Using this tab 70, the 
substrate is electrically connected to the electrode on the printed 
circuit board. The tab on the substrate is electrically connected to the electrode on 
the printed circuit board, usually with a lead wire. In other words, 
both ends of the lead wire are disposed in such a manner that the ends 
surround the side part of the external periphery of the substrate. Both 
ends of the lead wire are connected with solder or a conductive bonding 
agent. These connections are carried out on a wire-by-wire basis. 
This electrically connects and simultaneously mechanically fixes the 
substrate with the electrode part on the printed circuit board. As an example using a lead wire, PUPA 3-201545 discloses a semiconductor 
device which uses a lead wire for electrically connecting an electrode 
on the substrate having an IC chip mounted thereon with an external 
electrode. In this case, the lead wire has a circular projection with 
respect to the plane of the bottom part of the substrate, the projection  
 
serving to electrically connect with the electrode part on the printed 
circuit board. The electrode part on the substrate is electrically 
connected to the lead wire with a conductive bonding agent. In addition, IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 30, No. 3, August, 
1987 also discloses a semiconductor device which uses a lead wire for 
electrically connecting an electrode part of the substrate having an IC 
chip mounted thereon to an external electrode. In this case, the lead 
wire has a circular projection with respect to the plane of the
