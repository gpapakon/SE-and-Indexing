<ABSTRACT>
A spiral overlay having multiple variations, but generically, comprised of 
wire spirals intermeshed together by connecting rods extending across the conveyor 

in the transverse direction. Broadly, a first overlay is made up of spirals which 
may be tapered and afford pitch control by incorporating elongated loops in the 

spirals to limit the movement of the rods therein. The elongated loops also 
provide for collapsibility of the spirals relative to one another. A second overlay 

is made of integral or modular spirals such that the overlay includes upstanding 
spiral elements on its conveying surface to provide traction and separation of the 

articles being conveyed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to conveyor belts and to an overlay which
forms a support surface for conveyor belts, particularly an overlay comprised of
integral or modular wire spirals forming various lift, edge guard and lane divider
elements interconnected together by a system of connecting rods and connective
links.Wire conveyor belt systems are widely used in a great variety of industrial
fields. A wire mesh overlay generally comprises the support surface of a wire
conveyor belt, with the mesh overlay being formed of wire spirals intermeshed
together by connecting rods which extend transversely across the width of the belt.
Typically spiral overlays are comprised of interconnected flat spirals intermeshed
and connected to one another by the rods. The ends of the rods are inserted into
connective links which may also serve as tractive links around a sprocket wheel.One of the problems associated with a conventional spiral overlay is that
generally the spirals have been designed without any provision for controlling the
pitch of the spirals as the overlay winds around the sprocket wheel or around a 
turning section of the conveyor. The pitch is defined to be the distance between
adjacent rods of a conveyor overlay. In operation, the pitch decreases when
traversing a sprocket wheel on a straight run of a conveyor, and the pitch will vary
along the width of the overlay as an overlay winds around a turning section or
curve of the conveyor. Varying pitch is also experienced in the transition section
of a conveyor between a straight run and curved portion. Whenever the pitch
varies, however, without significant pitch control, adjacent spirals bunch up and
causes the leading edge of one spiral to be vertically displaced from the trailing
edge of an adjacent spiral. This displacement results in rippling of the overlay and
misalignment of the spirals, and can lead to permanent distortion if the spirals are
subject to bending and twisting stresses beyond their elastic limit.U.S. Patent Nos. 3,920,117 to Roinestad and 4,878,362 to Tyree, Jr.
exemplify previous attempts to provide some measure of pitch control to spiral
overlays. Both the Roinestad and Tyree patents provide spirals having upward
indentations on their undersides to contain the rods in bent wire portions.
Although the indentations may prevent some displacement of the rods toward each
other, the bent wire portions do not provide as positive a pitch control as the
elongated loops of the present invention which completely contain the rods therein
and
