<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to flame arrestor apparatus particularly useful for extinguishing any type of travelling deflagration
flame or detonation flame.A flame arrestor apparatus, usually comprises flame extinguishing elements which have very small diameter, typically
less than 1,02 mm (0.040 inch) diameter channels that permit gas flow but prevent flame transmission by quenching
or extinguishing combustion. This results from the transfer of heat (enthalpy) from the flame (high temperature) to
the solid matrix of channels (low temperature) which effectively provide a substantial heat sink.The quenching process is based on the drastic temperature difference between the flame and channel matrix
material. As such, this is a transport process that not only depends on the temperature gradient, but also on the channel
hydraulic diameter and the thermal conduction (diffusivity) properties of the gas.The rate of heat loss from the flame is significantly affected by the level of turbulence within the flame arrestor channel.
The turbulence is associated with the flow of unburnt gas through the flame arrestor as instigated by the pressure
rise that accompanies a flame front to the element. The flame induced flow is always in the same direction as the
impinging flame travel. The pressure rise can range from a small fraction to more than 100 times the initial (preignition)
absolute pressure in the system.An early proposal for a flame arrestor apparatus which is stated to operate under all atmospheric conditions is
described in US-A-1839655.Two of the most common types of flame arrestor elements are the crimped ribbon type such as described in U.S.
patent 4,909,730 and the parallel plate type as described in Canadian patent 1,057,187. The major advantage of these
constructions is that it is possible to build a device with a fairly large percentage of open flow area per unit cross section
while maintaining precise channel dimensions. This is very important because flame arrestors are often used in installations
where large volumes of gas must be vented with minimal back pressure on the system. It is generally understood
that even small deviations in channel dimensions can compromise flame arrestor performance. These can be referred
to as straight path flame arrestors because the gas flow takes a straight path from the channel entrance to the exit.A major disadvantage of the straight path units is that they do not extract heat from the flame very efficiently. One
method commonly used by designers to overcome the low
