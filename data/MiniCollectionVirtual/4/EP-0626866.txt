<ABSTRACT>
A process of tumor identification comprising administering a carotenoporphyrin to a tumor-bearing mammalian host and irradiating the mammalian host with light whereupon the carotenoporphyrin, which has been preferentially taken up by the tumor tissue, fluoresces and permits precise identification of the location, size and shape of the tumor tissue. An improved process of synthesizing carotenoporphyrins 1-5 is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
 THE USE OF CAROTENOPORPHYRINS AS TUMOR LOCALIZING AGENTS FOR DIAGNOSIS, VISUALIZATION AND DELIVERY OF SENSITIZERS TO TUMOR TISSUESBackground of the InventionField of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of diagnosing mammalian tumors and more particularly to a photoidentification method of diagnosing tumor tissue using a synthetic carotenoporphyrin which consists of a carotenoid polyene covalently linked to a porphyrin or related cyclic tetrapyrrole. The diagnostic agents preferentially localize in tumor tissue and fluoresce upon exposure to light. An improved method of synthesizing the diagnostic agents employed herein is also provided. Prior Art Carotenoid pigments, ubiquitous in photosynthetic membranes, are essential for the survival of green plants. Two facets of carotenoid function are recognized in photosynthetic membranes. First, carotenoids photoprotect by rapidly quenching chlorophyll triplet states which are formed in antenna systems or photosynthetic reaction centers. This triplet-triplet energy transfer prevents chlorophyll-photosensitized formation of highly destructive singlet oxygen which is injurious to the organism. In addition, carotenoids act as antennas by absorbing light in spectral regions where chlorophyll absorbs weakly and delivering the resulting exitation to chlorophyll via a singlet-singlet energy transfer process. Finally, nearby carotenoids quench chlorcnyll first excited singlet states. This quenching has been ascribed to energy transfer or electron transfer or some other process leading to internal conversion and is believed to play a role in the regulation of photosynthesis. 

 A number of porphyrin materials have been found to localize in tumor tissue and to damage that tissue upon irradiation with light. Many of these are being investigated as therapeutic agents ("he atoporphyrin derivative" and related materials) . All of these agents suffer from the problem that they are also absorbed by healthy tissue which is also harmed by the light.Various synthetic carotenoids designed to mimic carotenoid photoprotection have been investigated by researchers at Arizona State University. Synthetic carotenoporphyrins consisting of a carotenoid part covalently linked to a synthetic meso-tetraarylporphyrin which successfully exhibited both the photophysical functions of cartenoids in photosynthesis were first reported by Gary Dirks, Ana L. Moore, Thomas A. Moore and Devens Gust in Photochemistry and Photobioloσy. Vol. 32, pp 277-280 (Permagon Press Ltd. Great
