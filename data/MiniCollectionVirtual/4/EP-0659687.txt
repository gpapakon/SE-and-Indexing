<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for preparing titanium dioxide by the sulphate process, in which the wetting of the precipitated hydrated titanium oxide is carried out fractionally and the fractions and also the dilute acid are recycled.

Process for the production of titanium dioxide using 
the sulphate process by digesting raw materials 

containing titanium with sulphuric acid to form a 
digestion cake, dissolving the digestion cake to form 

a so-called black solution, optionally reducing and 
clarifying the black solution, optionally 

crystallising and separating iron (II) sulphate from 
the black solution, thermally hydrolysing the black 

solution to form titanium oxide hydrate and so-called 
thin acid, washing the titanium oxide hydrate, 

calcining the hydrate to yield titanium dioxide and 
returning the washing water and the thin acid to the 

process, characterised in that washing of the titanium 
oxide hydrate is performed fractionally, wherein the 

first fraction is combined with the thin acid and this 
mixture with a
n H
2
SO
4
 concentration of 20 to 23 wt.% is 
returned, after concentration, to the digestion, the 

second fraction with an H
2
SO
4
 concentration of 5 to 
15 wt.% is passed to the digestion or the dissolving 

process of the digestion cake, the third fraction with 
an H
2
SO
4
 concentration of 
<
 5 wt.% is returned to the 
hydrolysis and the crystallisation of iron (II) 

sulphate is performed in such a manner that the thin 
acid has a dissolved iron content of 
<
 3.5 wt.%. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the second fraction has an H
2
SO
4
 concentration of 7 to 
12 wt.%. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the third fraction has an H
2
SO
4
 concentration of 

<
 4 wt.%, in particular of 0.5 to 3 wt.%.  
 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the concentration of dissolved iron in the thin acid 

is 
<
 3 wt.%. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the thin acid has an H
2
SO
4
 concentration of 20 to 
22 wt.%. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the thin acid is concentrated by adding appropriate 

quantities of fraction 3 to the thin acid which is 
produced. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the iron content in the thin acid is achieved by 

digesting ilmenite and slag in appropriate ratios. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the iron content in the thin acid is achieved by 

precipitating and separating the iron(II) sulphate in 
the digestion solution prior to hydrolysis.
