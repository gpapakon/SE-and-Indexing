<ABSTRACT>
Process for the printing of porous substrate surfaces comprising: (a) etching the surface of the substrate, to render it porous, by contacting the surface of the substrate with a strong inorganic or strong organic acid; and then, in either sequence; (b) impregnating the porous substrate surface so obtained with a metal salt or a water-soluble cationic metal complex; and (c) thermotransfer printing the porous substrate surface, using a disperse dye which is capable of forming a chelate compound with the metal cation of the metal salt.

<DESCRIPTION>
Printing of Porous SubstratesThe present invention relates to a process for the light-fast colouration of porous substrates, especially glass fibres, without the use of a binder.It is already known to print or dye substrates such as glass fibres with cationic dyes. For example, in US 4543 103, cationic dyes are fixed on glass fibres from aqueous solution. While acceptable light fastness properties are obtained thereby for deep shades, for reasons of inadequate fixing, the dyes tend to become partly detached from the fibre, merely on contact with warm water. In the case of light shades, the light fastness of cationic dyes on glass fibres is decidedly poor.In French Patent No. 2 217 158, a method is described in which, rather than using the glass fibre surface itself as a dye receiver, there is used instead a polyvinyl chloride layer, which has previously been applied to the glass fibre surface. On exposure to high temperatures, however, the polyvinyl chloride layer is decomposed producing undesirable toxic and combustible vapours.It is also known, in Romanian Patent 76643 B, to produce thermotransfer prints on acid-treated glass fibre fabrics. Firstly, an acid treatment is applied to produce a porous layer on the fabric surface. Dispersion dyes are then incorporated into this layer without the need to use further auxiliaries. A lightf astness level of 4 or 5 can only be attained by this method, however, with a few dyes, and then only in deep shades. For light shades, using these dyes, the lightfastness falls to below 2.A method has now been found for achieving lightfast prints on porous surfaces, without the use of binder auxiliaries and using a wide range of dyes and shade levels.Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the printing of porous substrate surfaces, especially glass fibres, comprisinga) etching the surface of the substrate, to render it porous, by contacting the surface of 

 the substrate with a strong inorganic or strong organic acid; and then, in either sequence,b) impregnating the porous substrate surface so obtained with a metal salt or a water-soluble cationic metal complex; andc) thermotransfer printing the porous substrate surface, using a disperse dye which is capable of forming a chelate compound with the metal.Preferably, step b) is conducted before step c).The initial etching step of the process of the present invention may be carried out using a conventional inorganic mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or nitric acid but, in particular, sulphuric acid.
