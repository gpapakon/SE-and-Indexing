<ABSTRACT>
The field of the invention is that of biology applied to the development of additives having biocidal properties, which are intended to protect media in which microorganisms naturally grow (develop). The invention relates to the preparation of a culture medium for microflora, to a process for the preparation of a lyophilised inoculum, and to the lyophilised inoculum itself. According to the invention, the culture medium has the characteristic feature of allowing the simultaneous growth of bacteria, of yeasts and of fungi.   The invention finds a favoured application in the performance of tests for the resistance of oils for the working of metals, to attack from microorganisms.
