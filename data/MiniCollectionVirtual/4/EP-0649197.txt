<ABSTRACT>
In a method of producing a connector in which a 
metal terminal is supported by a core, and then a resin is 

molded around the core: the metal terminal is covered by a 
tubular member into which the metal terminal can be inserted, 

and tubular distal end edge portion of the tubular portion 
is pressed against a surface of the core to thereby seal the 

metal terminal; and the resin is molded around the core.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector produced by
double molding, and also to a method of producing the same.One known conventional method of producing a
connector is one using double molding. Figs. 7 and 8 shows a
method of producing a connector by double molding.Another double molding method of producing
a connector is disclosed in FR-A-2 662 113.As shown in Fig. 7 and 8, there are used three mold members
1 to 3 for forming an outer shape of a connector, that is,
the left and right mold members 1 and 2 movable left and
right apart from each other, and the lower mold member 3.
Metal terminal insertion holes 1a for respectively receiving
one ends 5a of metal terminals 5 supported by a core 4 are
formed in the left mold member 1. Metal terminal insertion
holes 3a for respectively receiving the other ends 5b of the
metal terminals 5 supported by the core 4 are formed in the
lower mold member 3.When double molding is to be carried out using these
mold members 1 to 3, the metal terminals 5 are beforehand
supported by the core 4, and the one ends 5a of the metal
terminals 5 are inserted respectively into the metal terminal
insertion holes 1a in the left mold member 1 while the other
ends 5b are inserted respectively into the metal terminal 
insertion holes 3a in the lower mold member 3. Then, after
the core 4 is sealingly surrounded by the three mold members
1 to 3, a resin is filled in this sealed space around the
core. After the resin is hardened, the mold is opened to
take out the double molded connector.In the above conventional connector production
method, the opposite ends 5a and 5b of the metal terminals 5
are to be electrically contacted with and connected to their
respective mating terminals, and therefore the resin should
not deposit on the surfaces of these terminal ends. For this
reason, if a gap between the metal terminal insertion hole
1a, 3a and the metal terminal 5 is decreased, the metal
terminals can not be inserted easily when they are set on the
mold members 1 and 3, and the surfaces of the metal terminals
are liable to be damaged, and a plated film is liable to be
peeled off. In contrast, if the gap between the metal
terminal insertion hole 1a, 3a and the metal terminal 5 is
increased, the resin flows into the gap, so that the resin
deposits on the surface of the metal terminal 5, thus causing
an incomplete contact. Therefore, the resin, thus flowed
into the gap and solidified, must be removed.There are occasions when the quality required for the
material of the core 4 is different from

34, 35) comprises the steps of:


molding said core (23; 31) of a first resin of nonconductive
nature, and
press-fitting said metal terminal (24, 25; 34, 35)
into said molded core (23; 31); and

   said step of molding resin around said core (23; 31)
comprises the step of:


molding a second resin such that said second resin
contacts an intermediate portion (22) of said core (23; 31)

from which no metal terminal (24, 25; 34, 35) extends.
The method of claim 1, wherein said second resin is

a resin having conductivity and higher elasticity than said
first resin.
The method according to claim 1, wherein said core
(23; 31) has a step portion (23a1; 32a, 33a) formed on a

peripheral edge portion of said core (23; 31) for fitting 
in said tubular distal end edge portion of said tublar portion. 
A connector formed by molding a second resin around a core (23; 31) of a first
non-conductive resin, said core (23; 31) supporting a metal terminal (24, 25; 34, 35), 
characterized
a) by a press-fit connection between said metal terminal (24, 25; 34, 35) and said
core (23; 31), and
b) by the body of said second resin covering only an intermediate portion (22) of
