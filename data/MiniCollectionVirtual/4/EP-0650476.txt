<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
peripheral vasodilating agents each containing, as an
active ingredient, a piperidine derivative having an
excellent peripheral vasodilating activity.Various compounds having a peripheral vasodilating
activity have been used for the treatment of
various disturbances in peripheral circulations. As
such compounds, there are known, for example, nicotinic
acid derivatives such as Inositol Nicotinate, Ecofrol,
Nicametate, Nicotinyl Alcohol Tartarate and the like;
norephedrin derivatives such as Nylidrin hydrochloride,
Isoxsuprine hydrochloride and the like; Bamethan sulfate
and compounds similar thereto; imidazoline derivatives
such as Tolazoline hydrochloride and the like; and
Trimethylcyclohexyl mandelate.Some of these known peripheral vasodilating
compounds, however, have effects to the heart such as
effect to heart rate, hypotensive effect, myocardinal.
contraction effect and the like, and other adverse
effects. Therefore, development of new peripheral 
vasodilating compound is still desired.In addition to the above, various compounds,
each of which having chemical structural formula similar
to that of the piperidine derivative represented by the
below-mentioned general formula (1), have been known in
some prior art references for example:
