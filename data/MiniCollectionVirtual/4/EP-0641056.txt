<ABSTRACT>
A current transformer (2) emits a voltage signal at its measurement output (2a) as a function of the current intensity to be measured. A comparison device (comparator) (3) compares the voltage signal with at least one adjustable nominal value (desired value, required value), and supplies an output signal as a function of the comparison result.

A monitoring apparatus for a plurality of lines, in particular with 
three lines which carry polyphase alternating current, wherein arranged in 

only one of the lines (L
1
, L
2
, L
3
) is a current transformer (2) which at its 
measurement output (2a), in dependence on the current strength to be 

measured, outputs a voltage signal which is fed to a comparison means (3) 
which compares the voltage signal to at least one preferably adjustable 

reference value and in dependence on the comparison result delivers an 
output signal, and arranged in all lines (L
1
, L
2
, L3) are respective 
switching units (8) which are controlled in dependence on the output signal 

of the comparison means (3) of the single current transformer (2), 
characterised in that connected to all lines (L
1
, L
2
, L
3
) are voltage 
monitoring apparatuses (9) which output output signals in dependence on the 

measured voltage, wherein said output signals and the output signal of the 
comparison means (3) are passed to the inputs of a processing circuit (7) 

for joint processing of said signals and the processing circuit (7) jointly 
actuates all switching units (8) in dependence on the output signals of the 

individual voltage monitoring apparatuses (9) and the output signal of the 
comparison means (3) of the current transformer (2). 
A monitoring apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the processing circuit (7) has at least one logic gate, preferably an AND-gate, 

whose inputs are connected to the inputs (7a, 7b, 7c) of the 
processing circuit (7) and whose output outputs a control signal. 
A monitoring apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that, besides the inputs (7a, 7b) for the output signals, 

the processing circuit (7) also has at least one further input (7c) for an 
external signal. 
A monitoring apparatus according to claim 3 characterised in that 
the further input (7c) receives an external signal from a device (11) for 

detecting the state of the load supplied by the monitored current network.  
 
A monitoring apparatus according to claim 4 characterised in that 
arranged on or in the load, preferably a motor, is a thermal protective 

switch (11) which is connected to the further input (7c). 
A monitoring apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that a safety cutout, preferably a safety fuse (1), is 

additionally installed in at least one and preferably all current-carrying 
lines and the voltage monitoring apparatuses (9) detect the voltage on the 

side of the safety cutout (1), which is towards the load. 
A monitoring apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that the comparison means (3) is so designed that it 

supplies a given output signal both when the compared signal exceeds a first 
reference value and also when the compared signal falls below a second 

reference value.
