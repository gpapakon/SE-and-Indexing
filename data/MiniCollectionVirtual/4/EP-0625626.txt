<ABSTRACT>
An electrical drive unit for an integral or multi-element door wing, whose drive operates with a DC motor and a controller which is suitably matched thereto, the DC voltage being obtained by rectification of the secondary winding voltage of a mains-operated transformer (6) whose primary winding is constructed such that it is split into at least two parts, in order to reduce the operating costs, and the two primary winding sections can be connected jointly or individually with the aid of a switching device (7, 8), to be precise as a function of an input signal which switches the series circuit of the at least two primary windings over to a circuit of one of the at least two primary windings.

<CLAIMS>
An electrical drive system for a one-part or multi-part door leaf, wherein the
drive is equipped with a mains-driven transformer, a DC motor and an appropriate

control system, characterised in that the DC voltage comes from rectification of the
secondary winding of the mains-driven transformer (6), of which the primary winding

is at divided into at least two parts, and wherein both primary winding sections can be
individually or jointly switched on by means of a switching device (7, 8), dependent

on an input signal which switches the series circuit of at least both primary windings
into one of the at least both primary windings.
An electrical drive system according to claim 1, characterised in that the
primary winding is subdivided into two winding sections by means of a central tap.
An electrical drive system according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
switching device (7, 8) has at least one transfer switch (8).
An electrical drive system according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the switching device (7, 8) is operated by a signal sensor (2).
