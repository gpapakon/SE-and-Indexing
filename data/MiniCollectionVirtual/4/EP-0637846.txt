<ABSTRACT>
Non-uniformly doped regions are formed adjacent to 
semiconductor junctions which underlie high voltage 

crossovers. The non-uniformly doped regions prevent 
junction breakdown caused by strong electric fields. The 

voltage drop between a crossover and an element of an 
integrated circuit is spread over the non-uniformly doped 

region, to lessen the voltage drop between the crossover 
and the junction and lessen the electric field at the 

junction. Dopant concentrations in the non-uniformly 
doped region may be selected to minimize use of silicon 

real estate. In some embodiments, a graded dopant 
concentration is lightest near the junction and increases 

toward a circuit element being protected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to crossover interconnects used in
high voltage integrated circuits and structures that prevent junction
breakdown caused by high voltage differences between crossovers and
underlying semiconductor junction.High voltage integrated circuits are useful in many applications
including power ICs. In a typical high voltage IC, the voltage
difference between two junctions formed in the same semiconductor can be
high. For example, in a power IC which supplies power to a household
appliance, voltage differences of 110 volts AC (or about 500 volts absolute)
are common. In other applications, voltages differences are even
higher. High voltage differences cause strong electric fields in the
semiconductor and can cause junction breakdown. Consequently, two circuit
elements in a high voltage IC that have high voltage difference, must be
seperated or shielded from each other.GB-A-2 163 597, EP-A-0 400 934 and JP-A-1 084 733 (Patent
Abstract) all disclose an integrated circuit
having a first doped region formed in a
semiconductor substrate
and a first lightly doped region
formed in the semiconductor substrate, adjacent to the edge of the first
doped region, the first lightly doped region having
a first junction at an edge of the first lightly doped 
region and underlying the conducting crossover.In GB-A-2 163 597 and in JP-A-1 084 733 a conducting crossover has a first portion overlying
an edge of the first doped region and overlies the first junction. In GB-A-2 163 597 and EP-A-0 400 934
the first lightly doped region has a non-uniform
dopant concentation.Fig. 1 shows a typical pair of doped regions 101 and 102
formed in a semiconductor substrate as part of a high voltage IC. When
the region 101 is at a low voltage level, zero volts, and the region 102
is at high voltage, such as 500 volts, there is a large voltage drop
between the junctions 121 and 122. The voltage drop causes an electric
field which forms in a region 103 between the junction. The electric
field and the change in voltage are related by the equation ΔV = ∫ E •
dx. With 
a fixed voltage, increasing the distance between the
junctions decreases the magnitude of the electric field.
If the electric field near the junction 121 or 122 is weak
enough a depletion region around the junctions 121 and 122
prevents unwanted current from flowing. If the electric
field gets too strong near a junction 121 or 122, junction
breakdown occurs and unwanted current flows.The problem of junction breakdown becomes worse when
high voltage crossovers are
