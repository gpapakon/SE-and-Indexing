<ABSTRACT>
A handheld terminal or telephone (10) for mobile 
communications has a transmitter aerial (13) which is 

articulatedly mounted on a main housing (11). The aerial 
can be articulated from a compact storage position on the 

housing to a deployed position where it extends from the 
housing away from the user. The terminal or telephone 

normally comprises a main housing (11) incorporating a 
digital keypad (18), a speaker (21) a microphone (19) and 

a planar radiator antenna (13). The antenna is hingedly-attached 
to an extension arm element (12) which, in turn, is 

hingedly-attached at the top of the main housing. During 
use, the antenna is pivoted above and away from the head of 

the user by a sufficient distance to significantly reduce or 
remove the exposure of the user to transmitted RF power of 

sufficient density to pose a health danger.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to handheld terminals
such as cordless telephones or wireless cellular telephones
for sending and receiving signals by means of an antenna and
a radio frequency signal processor such as a transmitter or
a receiver.Mobile or cellular telephones are becoming more
common and popular with motorists whose businesses require
them to be easily contacted during time periods when they
are driving their vehicles, such as salesmen, doctors and
other people who either spend much of their time driving or
whose occupations frequently involve emergency situations.There is much concern that frequent users of radio
frequency telephones may be endangered by overexposure to
radio frequency energy due to the fact that the handset of
such telephones incorporates the antenna which transmits the
amplified RF signals, and such antenna is in contact with or
closely-spaced from the head of the user. It has been
alleged that the frequent use of such RF telephones may be
responsible for the development of tumours, and other
medical problems by the users.The present invention is concerned with improved 
handheld compact mobile telephone receivers on which the
antenna portion or planar radiator portion is hingedly-attached
to the speaker portion for deployment between
compact folded position and unfolded use position. Compact
mobile telephone receivers having hingedly-attached antenna
portions are known in the art and reference is made to US
Patents 5,014,346 and 5,170,173 for their disclosure of such
devices. The handheld telephones of the cited patents are
designed for compactness, and the planar radiator portion is
attached at the bottom of the telephone, away from the
speaker unit, so as to be foldable up over the input keypad
for storage during periods of non-use, and to be unfoldable
into position proximate the mouth or chin of the user during
periods of transmission. Such devices are not designed to
overcome or avoid the possible health dangers of over
exposure to radio frequency energy posed by the proximity of
the antenna of RF mobile telephones to frequent users of
such telephones, nor do they inherently possess such
advantages because the antennae of such compact telephones
remain in close proximity to and aimed towards the head of
the users when unfolded into use position. The present
invention seeks to overcome this problem or at least
substantially reduce the radiation risk.EP-A-0,508,299 describes a mobile telephone handset 
having an antenna mounted on an extender portion which is
rotatab

<CLAIMS>
A compact terminal or telephone (10) for mobile
communications comprising an RF transmission circuitry

including a microphone (19), an RF signal amplifier (33) and
an antenna (13,35) electrically-connected to each other for

the transmission of messages, and an RF reception circuitry
including an antenna (13,35), an RF signal demodulator (39)

and a speaker (40) electrically connected to each other for
the reception of messages, said terminal or telephone

comprising an elongate main housing (11) having a microphone
(19) adjacent the bottom portion thereof, and a speaker,

   characterised in that the terminal or telephone further
comprises an elongate extender element (12) having a face

surface, an upper end and a lower end, the lower end of
which comprises a ball joint connection (15A) to hinge means

(15), said hinge means attaching said extender element (12)
to said housing (11) at an upper portion thereof for

rotation into storage position parallel to said housing,
said ball joint connection (15A) pivotably-attaching the

extender element (12) to the hinge means (15) for axial
rotation of said extender element (12) to direct the face

surface thereof in any desired direction relative to said
housing (11), and a planar radiator transmission/reception

antenna element (13) hingedly-attached (16) to the upper end of 
said extender element (12), remote from said lower end, and

a flexible RF cable signal coupler means (22,44,45,46,47)
between said main housing (11), through said extender

element (12) to said radiator antenna element (13) to couple
the RF transmission circuitry including the microphone (19)

of the main housing and the transmission antenna of the
antenna element, and to couple the RF reception circuitry

including the speaker (40) of the main housing (11) and the
reception antenna of the antenna element (13,35), whereby

for use of the terminal or telephone, the hinge means and
the extender element (12) are rotated from storage position

to extend above the upper portion of the main housing (11),
the extender element is rotated axially on said ball joint

connection to direct the face surface thereof in any desired
direction relative to the housing and the planar radiator

antenna element (13,35) is rotated and/or pivoted to face
upwardly and away from the user in the direction of optimum

transmission and reception, whereby the exposure of the user
to intense RF power transmitted by the antenna element

(13,35) is substantially reduced or eliminated.
A terminal as claimed in claim 1, wherein the RF
signal coupler comprises a flexible RF cable (22). 
A terminal as claimed in claim 1, wherein the RF
signal coupler comprises a rotatable inductive coupling

hinge (46,48,45,47).
A terminal as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, wherein a portion of the rear face of the main

housing (11) is recessed to receive the extender element
(12) and a planar radiator antenna element (13) when said

elements are rotated into coplanar relation and rotated
downwardly against said rear face into storage position, to

produce a compact terminal during periods of non-use.
A terminal as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, in which the RF transmission circuitry is

electrically isolated in the antenna element (13) to provide
reduced interference and improved performance.
A terminal as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, in which the hinged attachment of the extender

element (12) to the housing (11) further comprises a pivot
means enabling the extender element (12) to be pivoted

axially relative to the housing to adjust the direction of
the antenna element (13).
