<CLAIMS>
Device for freezing products, having a vibrating chute (2) 
comprising a bottom wall (3) on which the products to be 

frozen (9) move in contact with at least one film of liquefied 
gas (7), characterized in that the bottom wall (3) possesses 

an alternating pattern of projecting portions and hollow 
portions. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
projecting portions are distributed in a regular pattern. 
Device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in 
that the projecting parts are linked continuously with the 

hollow portions. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, in relation to the hollow portions, the 

height (
h
) of the projecting portions is less than the 
thickness (
e
) of the film of liquefied gas. 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
height (
h
) of the projecting portions does not exceed half the 
thickness (
e
) of the film of liquefied gas. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the projecting portions have a constant 

height (
h
). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least the bottom wall (3) consists of 

an embossed steel sheet. 
Device according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
embossed steel sheet is made of stainless steel.
