<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of 
reduced glutathione (GSH) for the manufacture of a medicament for 
the prevention of neurotoxicity induced by antitumor drugs active on the 
mitotic spindle. Examples of such drugs include Vinca alkaloids, 
such as vincristine and vinblastine, and cyclotaxan 
derivatives, whose parent compound, i.e. taxol, is 
presently under advanced clinical trial (Anti-Cancer 
Drugs, 2, 1991, page. 519-530). The most serious limitation to the success of 
antineoplastic chemotherapy resides in the severe 
toxicity annexed to the use of antitumor drugs: toxic 
symptoms limit administrable doses, they affect 
treatment cycles and seriously jeopardize the life 
quality of the oncologic patient. The high toxicity of the antitumor drugs is due to 
the lack of selective activity of the drugs themselves, 
which, besides hitting the tumor cells, interact with 
other organs or cell populations in the human body. Toxic symptoms deriving from the treatment with 
antitumor compounds are therefore strictly connected 
with the chemical structure of the compounds and with 
their mechanism of action. For example, anthracycline 
induced cardiotoxicity was strictly related to the 
quinone substructure typical of anthracyclines. In 
fact, this structure undergoes invivo a single-electron 
reduction, thus forming the emiquinone 
radical. This last compound is capable of promoting the 
avalanche formation of free oxygen radicals, which, in  
 
their turn, are responsible for the cardiac tissue 
damage. Not by chance several radical scavengers are 
able to perform a protective effect lowering the 
anthracycline cardiotoxicity. As another example, cis-platin is an antitumor 
agent which is endowed with heavy organo-specific 
toxicities, particularly relevant especially towards 
kidney. In fact, cis-platin, when absorbed by kidney, 
forms the diaquo species by loss of two chlorine ions. 
This happens since in the renal tubule the 
concentration of chlorine ions is lower than in blood. 
So activated cis-platin is capable of damaging the 
tubules with resulting nephropathy. Several thiol 
compounds, among which diethyldithiocarbamate and 
glutathione are able to protect kidney from the cis-platin 
effect, since they accumulate at kidney level 
and probably interact with the compound. Cis-platin is known to cause neurotoxic effects 
too (Eur. J. Cancer Vol. 27(3), 1991, 372-376), which 
several protective agents have been evaluated towards; 
among these, nimodipine (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990, 183, 
1710
