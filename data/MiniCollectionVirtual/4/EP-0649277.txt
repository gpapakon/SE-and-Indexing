<ABSTRACT>
A method for alteration of physiological function in plant or other eukaryotic, or prokaryotic cells, which comprises alteration, replacement or other manipulation of a conserved victorin-binding protein and/or a multi-protein complex containing a said protein in the cells, or binding of victorin or a modified victorin molecule with a victorin-binding protein and/or a multi-protein complex containing a said protein in the cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CONSERVED VICTORIN-BINDING VITAL PROTEINThis invention relates in general to the interactions between cells and pathogenic organisms, and in particular to plant-microbe interactions.The present invention has evolved from the identification of a conserved protein and/or multi-protein complex revealed by specific binding of the fungal metabolite, victorin, which is believed to be a component having a vital physiological function. The component is found not only in all plant cells, but in all cells, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic.More particularly, the present invention relates to the manipulation of this conserved protein or multi-protein complex in order to obtain an alteration of the physiological function within the cells. By way of example, the invention extends to alteration or replacement of this conserved victorin- binding protein and/or a multi-protein complex containing this protein in plant cells in order to obtain a desired alteration in the physiological function of the protein or complex, such as altered disease resistance of plants. The invention further extends to use of a modified victorin molecule in order to alter the binding of this molecule with the conserved victorin-binding protein and /or multi-protein complex again leading to alteration in the physiological function of the protein or complex such as inhibition of pathogenic organisms or selected cells (e.g. diseased cells), or as toxicity to plant cells (e.g. as a herbicide).The fungal toxin victorin has aroused great interest ever since its discovery in 1948 because of the toxin's unusual connection to plant disease resistance genes24'25. The toxin was discovered when a new disease 

appeared in oats following the introduction of a previously unknown susceptibility which was genetically linked to resistance against crown rust, a completely different disease. The rust resistance gene, Pc-2, was first incorporated into North American oat cultivars from crosses with the variety, Victoria, from Uruguay12,24,25. The gene provided strong resistance to crown rust caused by several races of a fungal pathogen (Puccinia coronata). Selections from crosses with Victoria were found to be so hypersensitive to the prevalent races of P. coronata that cells immediately surrounding the infection loci collapsed before the fungus could produce uredospores12,18,22.After wide deployment of those cultivars in the United States in the early 1940s, it soon became evident that they alone were susceptible to a completely new disease, victoria blight,
