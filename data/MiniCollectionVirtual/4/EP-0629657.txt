<ABSTRACT>
A crosslinkable resin composition in aqueous dispersion form 
which gives rise to a fast-drying good coating film 

comprises 

(A) an aqueous emulsion of an acrylic copolymer 
containing ketone of aldehyde groups and 
(B) a water-soluble polyhydrazide having a solubility of 
20 g or above per 100 g of water at 25°C. 
 
The composition is suitable for use as a clear coating 
material, top coating material, undercoating material, 

adhesive, and impregnant for cloth and paper, because of its 
ability to form a uniform coating film in a short time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin composition in 
aqueous dispersion form which is useful as an adhesive, 
coating material, and paint especially for water-permeable 
substrates such as concrete, woven cloth, wood, and paper. The recent trend in the fields of adhesive, coating 
material, and paint is towards the replacement of solvent-based 
products by aqueous ones from the view point of 
material saving, occupational safety, environmental 
protection, and hazard prevention. For example, an aqueous 
emulsion paint is attracting considerable attention in the 
field of paint. However, it has the disadvantage of giving 
rise to weaker coating films than a solvent-based paint 
because its film formation is due to coalescence of 
particles. A possible way of eliminating this disadvantage is 
by incorporating an acrylic emulsion containing ketone or 
aldehyde groups with a polyhydrazide, thereby forming a 
crosslinked coating film. Such crosslinkable resin 
compositions in aqueous emulsion form are disclosed in 
Japanese laid-open Patent applications Nos. 110248/1979, 
144432/1979, 147562/1980, 3857/1982, 38468/1985, 72742/1987, 
138376/1990, 175742/1990, and 249587/1992. A polyhydrazide 
contained in them brings about crosslinking at ordinary 
temperature; however, it needs heating for crosslinking if 
the acrylic emulsion contains carboxyl groups in place of 
ketone or aldehyde groups. Such systems as mentioned above, 
in which the polyhydrazide is usually adipodihydrazide or 
succinodihydrazide, suffer from the following disadvantages 
in practical use. (a) They do not form a uniform coating film 
with good adhesion. (b) They have to be in the form of dilute 
aqueous solution because the polyhydrazide is not readily  
 
soluble in water at normal temperature, and hence they need a 
long time before they form a coating film. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
crosslinkable resin composition in the form of an aqueous 
dispersion which, unlike the conventional ones, gives rise to 
fast drying and good coating film. In order to cope with the aforesaid problems involved in 
the conventional crosslinkable resin composition in aqueous 
dispersion form, the present inventors carried out a series 
of researches which led to the finding that the problems are 
solved if a specific water-soluble polyhydrazide is used 
which has a solubility of 20 g or more per 100 g of water at 
25°C. Subject matter of the present invention is a 
crosslinkable resin composition in the form of an aqueous
