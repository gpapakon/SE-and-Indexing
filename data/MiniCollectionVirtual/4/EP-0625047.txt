<ABSTRACT>

Also, an antibody, or a fragment thereof, in substantially pure form having as its epitope a domain of glycoprotein Ib alpha , the affinity of said antibody, or fragment thereof, for said epitope being dependent on the identity of the amino acid residue at position 145 of said glycoprotein. In addition, in a process for storing a supply of platelets for therapeutic use in a patient, the improvement comprising segregating said platelets into three stocks dependent upon whether residue 145 of glycoprotein Ib alpha  polypeptides of said platelets includes (A) threonine; (B) methionine; or (C) both threonine and methionine. Also, a method of immunoassay comprising contacting a sample of blood, or a composition derived therefrom, with alloantigenic Thr or Met

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to providing patients with blood products that minimize recognition and response thereto by the recipient's immune system.The fundamental function of the immune system of the body includes detecting foreign macromolecules that have invaded the body (such as those produced by or attached to a microorganism), distinguishing them from molecules produced by the body (self-molecules), and then producing specific cells and molecules (antibodies) that combine with the foreign macromolecules to inactivate them and eventually destroy them.The immune system functions in part by maintaining a library of cells, each of which is capable of producing a specific antibody that binds to a specific foreign macromolecule, the macromolecule being free in solution or attached to a foreign cell. An antibody is a protein that binds specifically to a foreign macromolecule at an epitope therein, leading to inactivation of the macromolecule that contains the epitope. An epitope is a structural domain or subregion of the macromolecule having a unique structure (for example, charge distribution and shape) that is recognized and targeted by the immune system. Normally, epitopes on self-molecules go unrecognized, that is, the immune system does not identify them as representing foreign structures against which a defense must be made.In order to function effectively, the immune system must be sensitive, that is, it must be able to detect those differences in structure (which are often very subtle) between "self molecules" and foreign molecules. These differences may include amino acid substitutions in proteins and/or differences in the type or orientation of carbohydrate and lipid components attached to macromolecules, including proteins, glycoproteins, glycolipids and lipoproteins.There are times when it is clinically desirable to give to a patient who has suffered blood loss associated with surgery or injury, foreign blood products, including cells, such as, for example, a transfusion of blood products collected from one or more donors. One type of therapeutic blood product comprises platelets. Platelets are non-nucleated, discoid, cell-like structures which are 2-5 microns in diameter and which are derived from megakaryocytic blood cells. They are crucial to the formation of clots, such as are necessary to heal an injury to a blood vessel, and are often administered to patients to facilitate clot formation.Platelets are believed to participate in clot formation as follows. The restriction or termination of
