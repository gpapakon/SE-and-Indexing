<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing trifluoromethylanilines of 
the formula (I), 


 
in which 


R
1
 and R
2
, independently of each other, are 
hydrogen, halogen, (C
1
-C
4
)-alkyl, hydroxyl, alkoxy, 
alkylthio, carboxyl, or a nitro or cyano group, by 

reacting compounds of the formula (II) 
 
in which 


X
1
, X
2
 and X
3
 are in each case, identically or 
differently, halogen atoms, 
a is zero or 1, 
Y is fluorine, chlorine or bromine, and 
R
1
 and R
2
 have the defined meaning, with anhydrous 
hydrofluoric acid at from 20 to 130°C, the molar 

ratio of anhydrous hydrofluoric acid to compound of 
the formula (II) being between 5 and 50, and converting 

the resulting aniline hydrofluorides with an 
alkali metal hydroxide into the free amine, which  

 
comprises using anhydrous hydrofluoric acid without 

addition of water. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a is zero 
in formula (II). 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein X
1
, 
X
2
 and X
3
 are chlorine atoms in formula (II). 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 3, wherein R
1
 and R
2
 are hydrogen or chlorine in 
formula (II). 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 4, wherein formula (II) represents 4-trichloromethylphenyl 

isocyanate. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 5, wherein the molar ratio of anhydrous 

hydrofluoric acid to compound of the formula (II) is 
between 10 and 40. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 6, wherein the reaction with anhydrous 

hydrofluoric acid is carried out at a temperature of 
from 20 to 80°C, preferably between 35 and 70°C. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 7, wherein potassium hydroxide is used as the 

base. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1 
to 8, wherein the anhydrous hydrofluoric acid is 

recycled.
