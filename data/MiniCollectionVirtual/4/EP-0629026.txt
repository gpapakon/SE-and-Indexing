<ABSTRACT>
A cable reel of the present invention uses a tape-shaped 
cable including a high-strength conductor having a 

high-strength conductor having a tensile strength of 500 to 
1500 N/mm², an elongation percentage of 0.5 to 50 % and a 

spring limitation value of 400 to 2000 N/mm². Accordingly, in 
such a cable reel, weight as well as in cost of the whole of 

parts in a cable reel can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cable reel adapted 
for performing electrical connection between a stationary 
matter and a movable matter by using a tape-shaped cable and 
particularly relates to a cable reel suitable for use in a 
steering apparatus of a vehicle. A cable reel according to the preamble of claim 1 is shown in 
Fig. 4 of US 49 75 063. DE 42 36 279 A1 shows a cable reel with a cable accommodated in 
a housing in a bifilar manner with a sharp 180° turn, which 
travels along the cable during rotating action. The conductor 
of the cable is made of a beryllium copper alloy. For example, when signal transmission is performed 
between the handle side of a car and the car body side of the 
car, such a device as shown in Fig. 1 is used. Namely, a 
tape-shaped cable is spirally housed in a housing having an 
inner cylinder and an outer cylinder so that the rotation of a 
handle is absorbed by tightening and loosening of the winding 
of the tape-shaped cable. Recently, requirements for reduction of weight of car 
parts and for reduction in cost thereof have been increased 
more strongly. The case of a cable reel is not exceptional. To 
attain the weight reduction of the cable reel and the cost 
reduction thereof, it is necessary to make the tape-shaped 
cable thinner, and to this end, it is necessary to make the 
conductor thinner. When ordinary tough pitch copper is used as 
the conductor and such copper is made thinner, there arises a 
problem that durability against repeated rotation is lowered.  
 It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
cable reel in which a tape-shaped cable is effective for 
reduction of the weight and cost of the cable reel without 
lowering the durability against rotation in spite of the 
reduction in thickness. In order to achieve the above object, the cable reel of the 
present invention comprises a housing including an inner 
cylinder having a first opening therein and an outer cylinder 
having a second opening therein; and a tape-shaped cable which 
is spirally housed in said housing, both end portions of said 
tape-shaped cable being led to the outside of said cable reel 
through said first opening and said second opening 
respectively; wherein said cable reel allows absorbing of 
relative rotations between said inner and outer cylinders by 
tightening or loosening of windings of said tape-shaped cable. 
Preferred embodiments are shown in the dependent claims. In the accompanying drawings; 
Fig. 1 is a view showing a condition before a cable 
reel of
