A part-spheroidal frying pan (1), made of sheet metal, as commonly 
used in China (wok), characterised in that at the underside of the frying pan (1), in the 

vicinity of the lowest point, support means made of an inductively heatable metal are 
rigidly connected to the wall of the frying pan, and serve to transmit energy radiated 

from a flat, inductively heated hotplate through heat conduction to the part of the 
frying pan (1) located thereabove. 
A frying pan according to claim 1, characterised in that the support 
means is a ring assembly surrounding the lowest point, which heats a corresponding 

ring part of the frying pan. 
A frying pan according to claim 2, characterised in that the ring 
assembly comprises rings (3,5) with a substantially flat cross-section, which are 

rigidly connected via lateral strips (6) with the wall of the flying pan (1). 
A flying pan according to claim 2, characterised in that the ring 
assembly consists of rings (8) with tubular cross-sections of different thickness, the 

rings with larger diameter being respectively thicker than the areas with smaller 
diameter. 
A frying pan according to claim 2, characterised in that the ring 
assembly consists of a plurality of concentrically arranged rings (3,5,8). 
A frying pan according to claim 1, characterised in that the support 
means is a ring (9) filling the space between a flat base area and the wall of the frying 

pan, the ring 9 having concentric annular grooves (10) on the side facing the wall of 
the frying pan. 
A frying pan according to claim 2, characterised in that the spaces 
between the rings (5) of the ring assembly are filled with a filling material (7) of 

increased heat conductivity and/or heat storage capacity. 
A frying pan according to claim 7, characterised in that the rings (5) 
with the filling material (7) form a composite metal body.
