<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the field of electronic devices.
More particularly, this invention relates to a digital television systems and to a
method for creating a high definition video display from a standard video signal.Standard television has not kept up with the modern electronic
revolution as exemplified by the recent developments in the personal
computer industry. Consequently, a standard television system does not
produce as high a quality picture as one might expect given the recent
advancements seen in other modern electronic systems.Standard television systems may receive and display analog, rather
than digital, video signals. A typical standard video signal is referred to as
an "interlaced" video signal. This means that each frame of video data
displayed on the standard system is divided into two fields. The first field
may, for example, contain the odd lines of the video frame. The second field
may contain the even lines of the same video frame. The two fields making
up the single frame are received and displayed successively on the standard
system and may appear to a viewer as a single frame. Dividing and
displaying a video frame in this manner may decrease the quality of the
output of a video system.Additionally, a standard television system may include an analog
display such as a cathode ray tube (hereinafter "CRT"). Because a CRT is an
analog device that does not provide a linear response to an input signal, a
"gamma curve" is introduced into a standard video signal to compensate for
the non-linearity of the CRT. Standard video signals therefore are not
directly compatible with a linear digital display. Furthermore, a standard television system may not be operable to
process a video signal prior to displaying the video signal. Similarly, a
standard television system may not be programmable to operate on a number
of different standard video signals. Finally, a standard television system
may be limited to a small display area on the order of 640 by 480 pixels.WO-A-92/09064 discloses a spatial light modulator and its driving
circuitry. The system receives red, green and blue signals or signals
in Y, U, V or Y, I, Q form. The input video signals are processed in
analogue processing circuits, which when required also convert the
signals to R, G, B form. The signals are then passed to anti-alias
filters and subsequently to analogue-to-digital converters. The R, G
and B signals are then applied to separate red, green and blue
channels, each of which has a deformable mirror device
