<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a liquid dispenser for a flowable medium, such as liquid soap or the like, contained in a storage container (1), comprising the bottle-shaped storage container (1) which is arranged, head-down, in a holder (3) of the dosing apparatus (4) equipped with a central opening spigot (2) and has a connecting neck (6) which is equipped with external thread (5) and in which there is arranged a cork-like inner closure (7) which is mounted in the connecting neck (6) so as to be displaceable from its closed position to open position, and at the inner closure (7), underneath its closure head (8), there is arranged at least one opening (9) which is freed in the open position and adjoined in the holder (3) by a liquid outlet channel (10). In order to be able automatically to effect the opening of the inner closure (7), but in particular its closure, when the storage container (1) has been substantially emptied and in order to be able to remove the inner closure without problems for the purpose of rinsing and refilling of the storage container (1), and to do so having regard to its reusability, the liquid dispenser according to the invention is constructed in such a way that the inner closure (7) is constructed, towards the outflow side, as an open sleeve (7') and the latter is equipped with a thread (11) capable of being screwed onto the opening spigot (2) of the holder (3) and having a pitch (S) acting in the same direction as the thread (5) of the connecting neck (6), and the pitch (S) of the threads (11, 11') of the sleeve (7'') and of the opening spigot (2) is smaller than the pitch (S) of the threads (5, 5') of the connecting neck (6) and of the associated holder (3).

<CLAIMS>
A liquid dispenser for a fluid medium, such as fluid soap or the like, contained in a
tank (1), comprising the overhead, bottle-shaped tank (1) arranged within a holder (3)

of the dosing unit (4) of the liquid dispenser, provided with a central opening pin (2),
with the tank having a connecting neck (6) provided with an outer thread (5) in which

neck is arranged a cork-type internal closure (7) which, in the connecting neck (6), is
displaced from its closing into its opening position, with at least one opening (9) exposed

in the opening position being arranged on the internal closure (7) below its closure head
(8), which opening, within the holder (3), is followed by a liquid outlet channel (10),

characterised in that the internal closure (7), toward the outlet side, is in the form of an
open sleeve (7') which is provided with a thread (11) adapted to be screwed to the

opening pin (2) of the holder (3) and having a pitch rectified toward the outer thread (5)
of the connecting neck (6), and that the pitch of the threads (11,11') of the sleeve (7) and

of the opening pin (2) is smaller than the pitch of the threads (5,5') of the connecting
neck (6) and of the associated holder (3).
A liquid dispenser according to claim 1, characterised in that the thread (11) of a
sleeve (2') of the holder (3) forming the opening pin (2) is an internal thread and the

thread (11') of the inner closure (7) is a mating outer thread.
A liquid dispenser according to claim 2, characterised in that the threads (5,5') have a
pitch which is substantially two to three times as large as the one of the threads (11,11'):
A liquid dispenser according to claims 2 or 3, characterised in that the upper rim (12)
of the sleeve (2') is arranged deeper by one thread lead than the upper rim (13) of the

holder (3). 
A liquid dispenser of claims 2 through 4, characterised in that an aligning pin (14) is
centrally arranged within the sleeve (2') is an aligning pin, the cross-section of which is

of a radial or cross-shaped configuration and is negligibly smaller than the cross-section
of the liquid outlet channel (10') within the internal closure (7) and, on the upper end, is

conically shaped, with the aligning pin (14) protruding beyond the upper rim (13) of the
holder (3).
