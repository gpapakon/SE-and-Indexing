<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a joint system for decorating plaster panels and its method of attachment. It relates to a joint system (1) comprising an open hollow strip (4), the end of its edges being flush with the surface of a plaster panel (3) and being connected to the wall (2) by an attachment device with respect to which this strip is slidably mounted. At least one slide (7) rests on top of the rear part of the hollow strip and is kept in place by the attachment device against the wall, separated from the latter by a predetermined distance.

Decorative joint system for the plastering of an external 
or internal wall (2), comprising a decorative open hollow 

strip (4) with the ends (5) of its edges flush with the 
outer surface of plastering (3) applied to the wall (2) and 

open at the side opposite the wall and a fixing device for 
connecting the said wall and the said strip (4) mounted to 

slide parallel to the wall relative to the said fixing 
device, characterised in that it includes at least one 

slide (7) covering the rear part of the hollow strip (4) 
and in that the fixing device is adapted to support at 

least one slide and to hold it against the wall but at a 
predetermined distance (c) from the latter, in that the 

slide (7) has a flat central part (20) in which an opening 
(21) is formed, and in that the fixing device (6) comprises 

a ribbed part (22) intended to be anchored in the wall (2), 
a spacer part (24) connected by means of a shoulder (25) to 

the ribbed part and a retaining flange (26) integral with 
the free end of the spacer part, the diameter of the spacer 

part being greater than the diameter of the ribbed part and 
adapted for the insertion of the slide into the opening 

(21) by force, the said retaining flange (26) bearing 
against the edge of the said opening (21) of the slide, at 

the side of the slide directed towards the strip. 
Joint system according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the flat central part (20) of the slide (7) has two 

shoulders (27) intended to ensure a space adapted for the 
presence of the retaining flange (26) of the fixing device 

(6) between the slide and the rear part of the strip. 
Joint system according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the hollow strip (4) includes a  

 
bottom (10) disposed parallel with the wall and bordered by 

two oblique walls (11) and in that at least one of the said 
oblique walls (11) ends in a nose-shaped profile section 

(12) folded towards the interior of the plastering, forming 
an internal throat. 
Joint system according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the hollow strip (13) includes a 

bottom (15) disposed parallel to the wall and bordered by 
two oblique walls (16, 17) and in that one of the said 

oblique walls (17) having a more gentle slope relative to 
the bottom of the hollow strip (13) ends in an apron (18) 

extending parallel to the wall above the slide (7). 
Joint system according to any one of claims 1 to 4, in 
which anchoring profile sections (29) are formed on the 

slide (7), characterised in that the slide includes one 
face on which two grooves (9) guiding the strip (4) in 

translation are formed and in that the anchoring profile 
sections (29) are provided on another face of the slide (7) 

directed towards the wall. 
Joint system according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that each of the two faces of the slide is 

provided with two shoulders (27, 30) of anchoring profile 
sections (29, 31) and two grooves (9, 32), the spacings of 

which are different and are adapted for guiding two strips 
of different widths so that the slide is reversible. 
Joint system according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that each of the two faces of the slide 

includes two parallel ribs bordering the central part (20)  
 

in which two grooves (9, 32) and two anchoring profile 
sections (29, 31) are formed and in that the ribs of one of 

the two faces the spacing (e) of which is the smallest has 
a nose-shaped outer profile section (33) and in that the 

depth and the spacing (f) of the grooves (32) formed in the 
ribs of the other face of the 
slide are such that, in 
projection, the base of the nose (33) at least partially 

overlaps the bases of the said grooves (32) and the upper 
part of the nose (33) at least partially overlaps the upper 

parts of the said grooves (32) and in that the height of 
the said grooves (32) is equal to the height of the said 

noses (33) so that the slide can be fitted over an 
identical slide. 
Joint system according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the slide (7) includes two wings (34) 

extending laterally into the plane of the central strip 
(20). 
Joint system according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the flat part of the slide comprising 

the central part (20) and the wings (34) has openings (35) 
with sufficient dimensions to allow for the passage of the 

plastering (3). 
Method of fixing a joint system corresponding to any one of 
claims 1 to 9, characterised in that it includes: 


drilling at least one hole in the wall (2), 
mounting the fixing device (6) on at least two slides 
(7),  

 
mounting the hollow strip (4, 13) on at least two slides 
provided with the fixing device, 
positioning the entire assembly, with the fixing device 
partially inserted in the holes formed in the wall, 
applying a first layer of plaster (3a) to the wall (2), 
inserting the entire assembly completely into the first 
layer of plaster until the shoulder (25) of the spacer 

part (24) comes to a stop against the wall, and 
adjustment and alignment thereof, and 
applying a second layer of plaster, thereby embedding 
the slides and making the end edges of the hollow strip 

level.
