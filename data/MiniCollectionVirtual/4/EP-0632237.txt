<ABSTRACT>
In an air heater for small spaces, in particular mobile spaces such as caravans, campervans, boats and the like, having a combustion chamber formed by a cylindrical flame tube, a heat-exchanger insert 1 surrounding the flame tube, which heat-exchanger insert is constructed by a cylindrical body 2 with heat-exchanging lamellae 3 directed inwardly to the flame tube and outwardly, and having a base block 5 constructed as an aluminium die casting, in which the waste-gas and heating-air ducts 6, 7 are constructed and which has a cylindrical mounting base 9 which forms part of the waste-gas duct and the end face of which is connected to an end face of the cylindrical body 2 of the heat-exchanger insert 1, provision is made for the connection of the mounting base 9 and the cylindrical body 2 to be formed by a friction-welded joint 10.

<CLAIMS>
Air heater for small areas, in particular moveable areas 
such as caravans, motor caravans, boats and similar, 

with a combustion chamber formed by a cylindrical flame 
tube, a heat exchanger insert (1) surrounding the flame 

tube which is constructed by a cylindrical body (2) with 
heat exchange blades (3) directed inwards towards the 

flame tube and outwards, and with a base block (5) 
constructed as an aluminium casting, in which exhaust 

gas and heating air ducts (6, 7) are provided, and which 
has a cylindrical attachment base (9) forming part of 

the exhaust gas duct, said attachment base being 
connected on the face side to a face of the cylindrical 

body (2) of the heat exchanger insert (1), characterised 
in that the connection of the attachment base (9) and 

the cylindrical body (2) is formed by a friction welded 
connection (10). 
Air heater according to Claim 1, characterised in that a 
cover (11) closing off the cylindrical body (2) on the 

side remote from the base block and engaging over the 
flame tube is provided, which is connected to the 

cylindrical body via a friction welded connection (10).
