<ABSTRACT>
An unloading delivery valve (10) for incorporation in a fuel delivery 
passage to a compression ignition engine has a valve member (17) 

slidable in a bore (14) which forms part of the flow path of the delivery 
passage. The valve member has a head (18) having on its under surface 

a portion (19) shaped to cooperate with a seating (16) at an end of the 
bore. The valve head is spring loaded into engagement with the seating 

(16) and is lifted from the seating when fuel flows to the engine. An 
unloading collar (21) is mounted on the valve member and cooperates 

with the wall of the bore to determine the return flow of fuel which 
flows when the valve head moves into engagement with the seating. A 

drilling (24) is formed in the collar to modify the return flow and the 
drilling is positioned so that during flow of fuel to the engine, the fuel 

which flows through the drilling impinges on the valve head at a position 
inwardly of the shaped portion (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to unloading delivery valves for incorporation in 
the high pressure fuel circuit of a fuel pumping apparatus intended to 
supply fuel to a compression ignition engine, the valve comprising a 
valve body defining a bore, the bore forming part of the flow path for 
fuel from the apparatus to the engine and the fuel flowing from the one 
end of the bore to the other end thereof during delivery of fuel to the 
associated engine, a seating defined at said other end of the bore, a valve 
member guided for movement in the bore, said valve member having a 
head located exterior of the bore and having a portion of its under 
surface shaped for cooperation with the seating, resilient means biasing 
the head into engagement with the seating, the head being lifted from 
the seating during delivery of fuel to the engine and the head being 
returned into engagement with the seating when the flow of fuel to the 
engine ceases, and an unloading collar mounted on the valve member, 
said collar cooperating with the wall of the bore to control the quantity 
of fuel which flows towards said one end of the bore during the return 
motion of the head towards the seating. Such valves are well known in the art and it is known in such valves to 
provide a small flat on the cylindrical surface of the unloading collar. 
The flat acts to modify the operating characteristics of the valve 
particularly at low engine speeds, the effect being to reduce the quantity 
of fuel which returns to said one end of the bore before the head of the 
valve member closes onto the seating. During the delivery of fuel to the 
engine some flow of fuel will take place along the gap between said flat 
and the wall of the bore and the fuel which flows along the gap will 
impinge on the head of the valve member and will tend to erode the 
shaped under surface thereof. This is particularly the case if there are  
 
any cavities present in the fuel column. As the shaped under surface 
erodes it can no longer form a seal with the seating and therefore 
intermediate successive deliveries of fuel through the valve the pressure 
upstream of the valve will fall to a greater extent than intended. The object of the present invention is to provide a valve of the kind 
specified in an improved form. According to the invention in a delivery valve of the kind specified there 
is formed in the collar a drilling the flow of fuel through which acts to 
modify the quantity of fuel which flows during the return motion of the 
valve head towards the
