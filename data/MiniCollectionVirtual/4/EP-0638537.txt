<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process 
for producing cyclobutanones. Cyclobutanones represented by the formula 
 
wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 may be the same or different 
and each denote a hydrogen atom or an alkyl or alkenyl 
group optionally substituted with at least one member 
selected from the group consisting of F, Cl and Br, 
provided that two of them may combine with each other 
to form a carbon ring; and X denotes F, Cl or Br, are 
known as useful intermediates for synthesizing 
pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals. For example, cyclobutanones can be converted 
into cyclopropanecarboxylic acids through Favorskii 
rearrangement under an alkaline condition (Angew. Chem. 
Int. Ed. Engl. 27, 797 (1988)), which acids can be used 
as the carboxylic acid component of pyrethroid 
insecticides having a high insecticidal activity.  
 A known process for producing cyclobutanones 
comprises contacting an α,α-dihaloacetyl 
halide with an ethylenic unsaturated compound in the 
presence of a dehalogenating agent, such as zinc or tin 
(JP-B-59-12093 & DE-A-2 539 048). However, α,α-dihaloacetyl halides are 
rather difficult to be available industrially. 
Moreover, to attain a good selectivity in the above 
process, the dehalogenating agent such as zinc or tin 
must be used in at least twice the molar amount of the 
α,α-dihaloacetyl halide and, to prevent a side 
reaction from occurring, the use of such specific 
solvents as dialkyl ethers or dialkyl ketones is 
required. The present inventor has made extensive 
study to find an industrially advantageous process for 
producing cyclobutanones. Resultantly, he has found 
that cyclobutanones can be obtained in a high yield by 
using α-haloacetyl halides, which are easily 
obtainable industrially, without using α,α-dihaloacetyl 
halides and by reacting the α-haloacetyl 
halides with ethylenic unsaturated compounds in the 
presence of a dehydrohalogenating agent and a Lewis 
acid. The present invention has been attained on the 
basis of above finding.  
 According to the present invention, there 
is provided a process for producing cyclobutanones 
represented by the formula 
 
wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 may be the same or different 
and each denote a hydrogen atom or an alkyl or alkenyl 
group optionally substituted with at least one member 
selected from the group consisting of F, Cl and Br, 
provided that two of them may combine with each other 
to form a carbon ring; and X denotes F, Cl or Br, which 
comprises reacting an α-haloacetyl halide represented
