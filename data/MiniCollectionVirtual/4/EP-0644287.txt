<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing a twist directly from fibre material, in that, by means of at least two spinning assemblies (R1, R2) arranged adjacent to one another, individual spun threads (F1, F2) are made and are first brought together in a hollow shaft (11), so as to run through this together in a first thread running direction, and thereafter are guided out of the hollow shaft (11) in a predominantly radial direction, in order then, in accordance with the two-for-one principle, to form and run through, in opposition to the first running direction, a thread balloon rotating about the spinning assemblies and to be fed through a winding assembly through a centring point (37) located in the extension of the hollow shaft, opened fibre material being fed to each spinning assembly through the enveloping surface defined by the thread balloon, and to a device suitable for carrying out this process.

Textile support for a thermo-bonding interlining of pieces of 
clothing, constituted by a weft knit comprising columns of warp stitches and 

yarns introduced regularly between the stitches in the width of the knit 
called weft knit, characterized in that it is composed exclusively of yarns of 

biodegradable cellulosic matter, the warp being exclusively of continuous 
multi-filament yarns. 
Textile support for thermo-bonding interlining according to claim 
1, characterized in that it is exclusively of viscose. 
Thermo-bonding interlining comprising a textile support 
according to one of claims 1 or 2 coated with spots of polymer, 

characterized in that the spots of polymer are in a polymer with low melting 
point. 
Method for obtaining a textile support for a thermo-bonding 
interlining of pieces of clothing, constituted by a weft knit comprising 

columns of warp stitches and yarns introduced regularly between the 
stitches in the width of the knit called weft knit, characterized in that said 

textile support being composed exclusively of yarns of biodegradable 
cellulosic matter and the warp being exclusively of continuous multi-filament 

yarns, said method consists in subjecting the weft knit (3) to a 
humidification treatment followed by a treatment of mechanical compacting 

by passage between a heated cylinder (1) and a compression belt (2), the 
temperature of the cylinder being at the most 130°C. 
Method according to claim 4 for obtaining a thermo-bonding 
interlining of pieces of clothing, characterized in that, after application of the 

spots of thermo-fusible polymer to the textile support, the latter is subjected 
to a second treatment of humidification and of mechanical compacting, 

similar to the first, the cylinder (1) being heated only to a temperature less 
than 80°C. 
Method according to claim 5, characterized in that the spots of 
polymer deposited on the textile support are in a polymer with low melting 

point.
