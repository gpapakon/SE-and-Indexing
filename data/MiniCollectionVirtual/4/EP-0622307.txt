<ABSTRACT>
A carrier and a process for packaging containers, which 
carrier is provided with a supporting member provided with two 

rows of interconnected supporting rings (1) for letting through 
and holding containers, as well as with a handle member (3) 

connected with the supporting member, the supporting rings 
being connected by elongated, flexible, strip-shaped members (2) 

with two rows of interconnected bearing rings (4), in such a 
manner that, on the one hand, the strip-shaped members can be 

given such a configuration that the bearing rings are located 
outside the container passage plane of the supporting member 

and, on the other hand, after moving the carrier from above 
over the containers, the bearing rings can be swivelled to 

below the containers into a position in which each bearing 
ring is in line with a supporting ring and forms a support for 

a container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carrier for packaging 
containers in two rows of each at least two pieces, which 
carrier is provided with a handle member and a supporting 
member connected therewith, provided with supporting rings, 
each for letting through and holding a container, arranged in 
two rows of each at least two pieces and interconnected to 
form one whole, from each of which supporting rings two 
elongated, strip-shaped members of equal length extend, which 
substantially lie in the median perpendicular plane of the row 
of associated supporting rings and are attached to a bearing 
ring at some distance from the supporting rings, and which 
bearing rings juxtaposed in a row are interconnected to form 
one whole. Such a carrier is known from FR-A-1 124 724. As 
described therein, the two rows of bearing rings are connected 
with each other in the same manner as the two rows of supporting 
rings to form one whole. Each bearing ring is provided 
with an annular element which can let through and hold a 
container and with at least one strip-shaped member which 
extends at a short distance below the annular element, and on 
which the bottom of a container can rest. In order to enable 
the containers to be placed in such a carrier, each container 
supplied must be lifted up and moved from above through a 
supporting ring and an annular element of a bearing ring until 
the bottom of the container contacts the strip-shaped member. Moving the containers from above into the supporting 
and bearing rings not only means that during the filling of a 
carrier each container must be lifted up and handled, but also 
that a label affixed to the container may soon be damaged 
during the movement along the supporting and bearing rings. In 
addition, the containers are often packaged in the carriers 
when the label on the container is still wet, which considerably 
increases the risk of damage to the label when placing 
the container in the carrier.  The object of the invention is to design a carrier of 
the type described in the opening paragraph such that it can 
be filled with containers in a relatively simple manner 
without incurring the risk of damage to the label caused by 
contact between the container and the carrier. According to the invention this object is attained in 
a carrier of the type described in the opening paragraph by 
making the strip-shaped members so flexible that, on the one 
hand, they can be given such a configuration that each bearing 
ring is substantially located outside a straight

<CLAIMS>
A carrier for packaging containers in two rows of each 
at least two pieces, which carrier is provided with a handle 

member and a supporting member connected therewith, provided 
with supporting rings, each for letting through and holding a 

container, arranged in two rows of each at least two pieces 
and interconnected to form one whole, from each of which 

supporting rings two elongated, strip-shaped members of equal 
length extend, which substantially lie in the median perpendicular 

plane of the row of associated supporting rings and 
are attached to a bearing ring at some distance from the 

supporting rings, and which bearing rings juxtaposed in a row 
are interconnected to form one whole, characterized in that 

the strip-shaped members are so flexible that, on the one 
hand, they can be given such a configuration that each bearing 

ring is substantially located outside a straight cylinder 
defined by the inner peripheral area of the supporting ring 

with which said bearing ring is connected by the strip-shaped 
members and, on the other hand, such a configuration that the 

axis of the bearing ring substantially coincides with the axis 
of the supporting ring with which said bearing ring is 

connected by the strip-shaped members. 
A carrier according to claim 1, characterized in that 
means are present with which the two rows of bearing rings can 

be interconnected in a mutually adjacent position. 
A carrier according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the means for connecting two rows of bearing rings have a 

semipermanent character, such as a glued or welded joint or a 
mechanical joint via deformable cramps or rings. 
A carrier according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the handle member is formed by a rod-shaped 

member extending substantially parallel to the supporting 
member, and which is connected with the supporting member 

by further strip-shaped members extending in line with the 
former strip-shaped members. 
A carrier according to claim 4, characterized in that 
no further strip-shaped members extend from the outer supporting 

rings of the two rows. 
A carrier according to claim 5, characterized in that 
from each end of the rod-shaped member a curved strip-shaped 

member extends which terminates at the meeting point of two 
outer supporting rings. 
A carrier according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the further strip-shaped members, seen transversely to a row, 

lie at an acute angle to the plane of symmetry extending 
perpendicularly to said row, preferably an angle between 5° 

and 20°. 
A carrier according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the bearing rings are formed by disk 

rings arranged at the ends of the strip-shaped members facing 
away from the supporting rings. 
A carrier according to claim 8, characterized in that 
each disk ring preferably has a j-shaped cross-section. 
A process for packaging a plurality of containers in a 
carrier according to any of the preceding claims, arranged in 

two rows of each at least two pieces, characterized by 
supplying the containers on a supporting surface in two 

juxtaposed rows, moving the carrier, of which the rows of 
bearing rings are tilted outwards, with its supporting rings 

over the containers so far that the bearing rings connected 
therewith, which during this movement of the carrier are in 

juxtaposition to the left and right of the containers, are 
brought to below the supporting surface in line with the rows 

of supporting rings located above, after which the supporting 
surface is drawn from between the containers and the bearing 

rings, so that the containers sink down with respect to the 
carrier and come to rest on and in the bearing rings. 
A carrier with containers placed therein, obtained by 
using the process according to claim 10.
