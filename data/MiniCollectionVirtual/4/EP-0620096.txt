<ABSTRACT>
Injection molding apparatus wherein a torpedo (46) is 
mounted in the front end of a heated nozzle (10). The torpedo (46) 

has spaced blades (94) extending inwardly from an outer collar (92) 
to an elongated shaft (90) which extends centrally in the melt 

bore (42). The torpedo shaft (90) has an elongated central portion (112) 
which is securely press fitted in a steel outer sleeve (114) from 

which the blades (94) extend. The elongated central portion (112) of 
the torpedo shaft (90) extends forwardly into the gate (14), and is 

formed of an engineered ceramic such as silicon carbide 
which is very thermally conductive as well as abrasion and 

corrosion resistant. In one embodiment, the gate (14) extends 
through a gate insert (48) which is also formed of a thermally 

conductive and abrasion and corrosion resistant engineered 
ceramic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to injection 
molding and more particularly to apparatus having a torpedo 
with a central shaft seated in the front end of a heated 
nozzle. The use of torpedoes with conductive central 
shafts extending in the melt bore to enhance the 
thermodynamic cycle is well known. As seen in the 
applicants' U.S. patent number 4,450,999 which issued May 
29, 1984, it is also well known to make the torpedo shaft 
with an inner portion formed of a highly conductive metal 
such as copper covered by a protective casing formed of 
high speed steel. A torpedo having a similar shaft 
extending in alignment with a gate in a gate insert is  
 
shown in the applicants' U.S. patent number 4,771,164 which 
issued September 13, 1988. While these previous torpedoes 
have been successful for many applications, wearing of the 
shaft is a problem when the melt contains highly abrasive 
and corrosive materials such as ceramics, fiberglass, 
metals or minerals. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to at least partially overcome the disadvantages 
of the prior art by providing injection molding apparatus 
which is more abrasive and corrosion resistant. To this end, in one of its aspects, the invention 
provides injection molding apparatus comprising a heated 
nozzle seated in a well in a mold and a torpedo to convey 
melt to a gate, the nozzle having a rear end, a front end, 
a melt bore extending longitudinally therethrough from the 
rear end to the front end in alignment with the gate, and 
a seat extending around the melt bore at the front end of 
the nozzle, the torpedo having an outer collar, an 
elongated shaft extending centrally through the outer 
collar with an opening extending through the torpedo 
between the central shaft and the outer collar, and at 
least one support member extending across the opening 
between the central shaft and the outer collar, the outer  
 
collar being removably received in the seat at the front 
end of the nozzle with the opening through the torpedo 
aligned with the melt bore through the nozzle and the 
central shaft of the torpedo aligned with the gate, 
apparatus wherein the elongated central shaft of the 
torpedo has an elongated central portion extending through 
an outer sleeve, the at least one support member extends 
outwardly from the outer sleeve to the outer collar, the 
central portion is secured in the outer sleeve to extend 
from the melt bore in alignment with the gate, and the 
central portion of the elongated shaft of the
