<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of low temperature plasma 
technology for the corrosion protection of metals. Our novel process 
involves pretreatment of the metal with a plasma gas, followed by plasma 
deposition of a thin polymer film, and finally application of an cathodic 
electrocoat primer. In particular, the pretreatment step removes oxygen 
from the surface of the metal. The corrosion protection of steel substrates is important for 
many industries, including the automotive and steel industries. Currently the 
most common methods of corrosion protection of steel substrates are 
galvanizing, application of zinc phosphate, application of primer materials 
by electrodeposition, conventional spray or dip priming, oil coating and 
combinations thereof. However, especially in the automotive industry, these 
methods are associated with pollution in the form of volatile organic 
compounds (VOC), (2) excessive waste disposal, (3) inadequate coverage of 
recessed areas, and (5) inadequate retention or performance of corrosion 
protection. It is generally known that plasma deposition of thin films gives 
a very dense layer of film, with uniform deposition, no "pin holes", and good 
edge coverage. Furthermore, such a process does not require solvents, so 
there is no VOC problem. However, most of the work in the plasma 
deposition area has been restricted to small objects (e.g., microelectronic 
components). Plasma processing for larger objects has been used primarily 
for plastic substrates. The plasma deposition of organic films on metal is generally 
described in an article entitled "Surface Coating of Metals in a Glow 
Discharge" in the Journal of the Oil and Colour Chemists Association, Vol. 
48, 1965 (hereinafter, the "Glow Discharge" article). This article describes,  
 
in general terms, a method of coating a steel substrate with thin polymer 
films derived from organic vapors (styrene, acrylates, butadiene, diethyl 
silicate, and tetraethyl orthosilicate) using glow discharge (i.e., plasma 
deposition) for short term protection of the steel substrate. The plasma deposition of organosilanes and other thin films 
for corrosion protection of steel in the automotive industry is disclosed in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,980,196. In the processes disclosed therein, multi-layered 
coatings are formed, including the combination of a thin film, by means of 
plasma deposition, with a primer coating. In Example 5 of the patent, an 
electrocoat primer was employed. However, in order to be competitive with 
present

<CLAIMS>
A method of coating a metal substrate to provide corrosion 
protection, which method comprises the following steps: 


(a) plasma pretreatment of the metal substrate with a gas plasma 
selected from oxygen, air, hydrogen, nitrogen, argon, water 

pressure or their mixtures, to remove oxygen and oxides from 
the surface of the metal substrate; 
(b) plasma deposition comprising polymerization of an organic 
compound to form an oxygen-free thin film on the pretreated 

metal substrate, wherein the plasma deposition employs DC 
power and is carried out in a vacuum chamber enclosing a 

cathode and anode, and wherein the metal substrate is the 
cathode; and 
(c) cathodic electrocoat application of a primer over the thin 
polymeric film. 
 
characterized in that the gas plasma used to 

pretreat the metal substrate in step (a) is a mixture 
of argon and hydrogen. 
The method of claim 1, wherein at least one anode is 
magnetically enhanced in step (a) and, or (b). 
The method of claim 1 where the plasma deposition of a thin 
polymeric film in step (b) employs a compound selected from the 

group consisting of methylsilane, trimethylsilane, dimethylsilane, 
tetramethylsilane, methane, or combinations thereof. 
The method of claim 1 where the metal substrate being processed 
is non-galvanized cold-rolled or bare steel. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising a step (d) in which a monocoat, 
basecoat, or basecoat and clearcoat finish is applied over the 

primer. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the gas plasma used for pretreatment 
in step (a) comprises, by mole percent, 20 to 80% of hydrogen and 

30 to 20% of argon.
