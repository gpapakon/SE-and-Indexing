<ABSTRACT>
In order to generate a reaction force for the actuating element of a device to be actuated, a compression spring, normally designed as a helical coil spring, is provided, which is arranged so that it acts on the actuating element counter to its actuating direction. If the actuating element is to perform a large stroke, it is necessary to use a compression spring with a large coil interval. This necessitates a relatively large installation space for the spring, however, which is not always available. In order to solve this problem, a device for generating a reaction force has been created, which has a pressure medium chamber (4, 52), defined by a movably arranged wall (5, 6, 7, 51), the wall (5, 6, 7, 51) or a force-transmitting element (9, 15, 55, 65, 58) having an operating connection with the wall (5, 6, 7, 51) or/and the actuating element (13, 64) being so arranged in relation to the actuating element (13, 64) or a part connected to the actuating element (13, 64) that in an actuating stroke of the actuating element (13, 64), the wall (5, 6, 7, 51) is moved by the force-transmitting element (9, 15, 55, 65, 58) against the force exerted on the wall (5, 6, 7, 51) by the pressure medium in the pressure medium chamber (4, 52).

member (13, 64), on which stop the wall (5, 6, 7, 

51) or the force transmission member (9, 15, 55, 65,

actuating member (13, 64) or between the wall (5, 6, 
7, 51), the force transmission member (9, 15, 55, 65, 

58) and the actuating member (13, 64) is produced only 
when the actuating member (13, 64) has travelled over 

an idling distance X during an actuation stroke. 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the device to be actuated is in the form of a motor 
vehicle brake valve for a pressure medium-operated brake 

system for a motor vehicle. 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the movable wall is in the form of a piston (5, 6, 7, 
51) of a cylinder/piston arrangement (3, 41, 40, 4, 51, 54, 

52) which contains the pressure medium chamber (4, 52).
