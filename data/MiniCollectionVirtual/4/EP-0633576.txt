<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an integrated circuit having a
built-in EEPROM which utilizes a high voltage to write or erase

data, wherein the integrated circuit is adapted to operate with
a lower power supply voltage. There are provided Vpp switches

(400a-400d, 460e, 460f) for supplying a high voltage to bit
lines (BL1, BL2), control gate lines (CGL1, CGL2), and word

lines (WL1, WL2), wherein each Vpp switch includes a multi-stage
charge pump comprising a diode-connected transistors (M60, M70)

and capacitors (C40, C50). The Vpp switch has an enhanced
charging-up capability, and can transfer a high voltage with a

low power supply voltage. Thus, the Vpp switch can operate
successfully with a low power supply voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
integrated circuit, and more specifically to a technique for
expanding the operating voltage of a semiconductor integrated
circuit such as a microcomputer having a built-in EEPROM.Referring to Figures 7-13, the configuration and
operation regarding an EEPROM and its peripheral circuits will
be described first taking a microcomputer having a built-in
EEPROM as an example.Figure 7 is a block diagram illustrating a general
configuration of a microcomputer having a built-in EEPROM
(Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) for use in
an IC card. In Figure 7, reference numeral 10 denotes an IC
card or a microcomputer for performing data processing. In the
microcomputer 10, reference numeral 1 denotes a CPU or a central
processing unit that is responsible for operations and control
regarding data processing. That is, the CPU 1 is responsible
for execution and control of a program associated with the data
processing. Reference numeral 4 denotes a ROM serving as a
program memory for storing a program required for the data
processing. That is, the ROM 4 stores a program that executes
various functions a user of a card needs. Reference numeral 5
denotes an EEPROM acting as a nonvolatile memory in which
personal information of a card user is written and stored.
Reference numeral 6 denotes a RAM acting as a temporary memory
for temporarily storing data required for the data processing. 
Reference numeral 7 denotes an input/output circuit for
inputting and outputting data from or to peripheral devices.
Reference numeral 2 denotes a system bus for making connection
between the above-described component elements. Furthermore, P1
denotes a positive power supply terminal, P2 a negative power
supply terminal or a ground terminal, P3 a reset input terminal
for receiving a reset signal to initialize the CPU 1, P4 a clock
input terminal for receiving a clock signal, and P5 an I/O
terminal for inputting and outputting data. The I/O terminal P5
is connected to the input/output circuit 7 that is further
connected to the system bus 2. The input/output circuit 7 is
responsible for data communication via the I/O terminal P5
between the IC card 10 and peripheral devices (not shown).Figure 8 is a block diagram illustrating a general
configuration of an EEPROM. In this figure, reference numeral
31 denotes a memory cell array comprising memory cells (refer to
Figures 9 and 10) arranged in a matrix form, in which memory
cells on each row are connected in common to a
