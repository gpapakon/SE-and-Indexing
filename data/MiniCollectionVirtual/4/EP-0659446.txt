<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement in 
connection with vaporizing an anaesthetic. The invention 

comprises a vaporizing chamber (1) for an anaesthetic 
liquid (2) to be vaporized and means for mixing vaporized 

anaesthetic with fresh gas and delivering the mixture to be 
inhaled by a patient (7). To stabilize the temperature of 

the anaesthetic liquid in the vaporizing situation, an air 
flow enhancing the transfer of heat energy between the 

anaesthetic liquid (2) within the vaporizing chamber (1) 
and air outside the vaporizing chamber is applied to at 

least one exterior surface of the vaporizing chamber in 
forced circulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method in 
connection with vaporizing an anaesthetic, in which an 
anaesthetic vaporized in a vaporizing chamber is mixed 
with fresh gas and delivered to be inhaled by a patient. 
The invention also relates to an arrangement in 
connection with vaporizing an anaesthetic. The invention thus relates to anaesthesia and 
particularly to vaporizing a liquid anaesthetic. The 
vaporized anaesthetic is mixed with fresh gas, which 
may comprise oxygen and nitrous oxide. Fresh gas is obtained 
from the hospital gas supply system by forming 
a mixture of various gases, for instance. The mixed 
flow comprised of fresh gas and vaporized anaesthetic 
is administered for the patient to inhale when anaesthetizing 
the patient, for instance. Vaporization of a liquid anaesthetic consumes 
thermal energy in a similar manner as vaporization of 
other liquid substances does. In conventional vaporizers 
previously known in the field, sufficient heating 
energy is transmitted to the liquid by convection from 
the constructions of the vaporizer and from ambient 
air. The temperature of the vaporizer, and of the anaesthetic 
contained therein, tends to decrease in 
vaporization. When the temperature of the anaesthetizing 
liquid drops, also the pressure of vapour evaporated 
therefrom, and simultaneously its concentration 
within the vaporizer, decreases. This would cause the 
concentration of the administered anaesthetic to decrease, 
if no compensation according to temperature 
were carried out. A new anaesthetic, desflurane, has recently 
been developed in the field. The physical and physiological  
 
properties of desflurane are markedly different 
from those of conventional anaesthetics. Desflurane has 
a boiling point of 23.5°C at normal air pressure, while 
that of other anaesthetics is about 50°C. Furthermore, 
desflurane has a much stronger dependency of vapour 
pressure on temperature at normal operating temperatures 
than the anaesthetics previously employed. For 
example at 20°C, desflurane has a vapour pressure of 32 
mmHg/°C whilst that of halothane, one of the previously 
used anaesthetics, is 10 mmHg/°C. Moreover, the ranges 
of use that are possible for desflurane are broader, 0-18%, 
than those for previously employed anaesthetics, 
which are 0-5%. The above factors require new methods 
for safe and reliable vaporization of desflurane. In the conventional vaporizer of the by-pass 
type, part of the fresh gas is passed via a conduit to 
a vaporizing container containing an
