<ABSTRACT>
Magnetic recording apparatus are provided for recording signals on a magnetic tape 
(102). A recording head (41) records signals in successive tracks on the tape and a tape 

transport transports a magnetic tape past the recording head in a recording direction. In 
one embodiment, absolute track addresses are recorded in at least some of the tracks, 

the absolute track address of each track corresponding to a distance of the track from a 
start position (43) of the magnetic tape. Recording is initiated from a track having a 

predetermined absolute track address corresponding to a predetermined distance from 
the start position. In a further embodiment, the tape transport transports the tape 

initially by a distance (R) necessary to establish a stable running state, and thereafter 
transports the tape a further distance (S) while recording reproduction control signals so 

that during reproduction a stable running state may be achieved. Thereafter, 
information to be output is recorded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to video tape recording
apparatus and methods providing control of recording commencement
at the tape top.Each of Figures 1 and 2 illustrates a respectively
different mechanical tape deck in which an 8-mm tape cassette 100
has been mounted and from which a magnetic tape 102 has been
drawn from a cassette shell 104 and wrapped around a rotary drum
106 thereof. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, an infrared generating
unit 62 produces infrared light which is projected toward an
infrared sensing unit 61 across the tape 102. The magnetic tape
102 includes a transparent leader portion at the beginning
thereof followed by a real (recordable) magnetic tape portion.
Since the leader portion is transparent, light from the unit 62
passes therethrough to the sensing unit 61, but is interrupted by
the real tape portion when it intervenes between units 61 and 62.In each of Figures 1 and 2, a border position 63
representing the position at which the leader portion joins the
real tape portion of the magnetic tape 102, is detected by the
infrared sensing unit 61 and the infrared generating unit 62. It
will be seen that the distance along the tape 102 from the
position 63 to a portion thereof wrapped around the drum 106,
referred to as run-in portion 64 differs in the case of the tape
decks shown in Figures 1 and 2. The 8-mm VTR has a system controller which commences
recording upon detection of the border position 63 by means of
the units 61 and 62. Since the distance between the tape run-in
portion and the border position 63 in the case of the mechanical
deck of Fig. 1 is longer than that produced by the mechanical
deck of Fig. 2, the recording area of the magnetic tape 102 in
the case of the mechanical deck of Fig. 1 begins at a point
further from the border position 63 than in the case of the
mechanical deck of Fig. 2. This result is illustrated by Figs.
3A and 3B which show, respectively, a recording area 67 of the
tape 102 recorded by the mechanical deck of Fig. 1 and a
recording area 67' of the tape 102 as recorded by the mechanical
deck of Fig. 2.As will be seen from Figs. 3A and 3B, when a tape which
has been recorded by the mechanical deck of Fig. 2 is reproduced
by the mechanical deck of Fig. 1, portion 66 of the recording
area 67' in Fig. 3B will not be reproduced. In addition, when a
tape which has been recorded by the mechanical deck of Fig. 2 is
later re-recorded by the mechanical deck of Fig. 1, and the re-recorded
tape is thereafter reproduced by the mechanical deck of
Fig. 2,

A video tape recorder for recording and reproducing audio and video signals in
tracks on a magnetic tape (102), comprising:


means for recording and reproducing absolute track addresses in at least
some of a plurality of tracks on a magnetic tape (102), the absolute track address

corresponding to a distance of a respective
track from a beginning of tape position (43), the

absolute track addresses being incremented or decremented according to a
predetermined rule with increasing distance of the track position from the beginning of tape position along a recording direction of the

magnetic tape (102);
the recording and reproducing means comprising a rotary head (37, 41, 42, 201)
for recording and/or reproducing audio and video signals in and from the plurality of

tracks;
a detector means (110) disposed from said rotary head for detecting said beginning
of tape position (43); and
control means for controlling the recording and reproducing means to initiate
recording of the audio and video signals from a tape position having a predetermined

distance from said beginning of tape position given by the distance between said detector (110) and said
rotary head (37, 41, 42, 201) after tape insertion, characterised by the control means advancing, during the

reproduction of a correspondingly recorded magnetic tape (102), the tape at first for a
predetermined amount (L1) if a track with a track address cannot be detected by the

rotary head (37, 41, 42, 201) at an initial position of the inserted tape, and subsequentially detecting the
track address again and to identify the tape as blank if the track address cannot be

formed at the new position.
