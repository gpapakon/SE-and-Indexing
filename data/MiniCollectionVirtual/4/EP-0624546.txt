<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluidizable composition for use 
in a fluidized bed process for the production of hydrogen and carbon 
monoxide from a low molecular weight hydrocarbon, especially a process 
for synthesis gas generation. Known processes of this type for producing synthesis gas, or 
syn gas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) include those via the reaction 
of low molecular weight hydrocarbons, primarily methane, by contact 
with a bed of catalyst in the presence of steam (steam reforming 
process), or oxygen (partial oxidation process), or both steam and 
oxygen, at elevated temperature. EP-A-0 033 505 and EP-A-0 333 037 both disclose catalysts 
for, and use of a bed of those catalysts in, the steam reforming of a 
hydrocarbon feed. In the former, the catalyst (in unreduced 
condition) consists of nickel oxide, a rare earth metal oxide or 
yttria; and zirconia as a support. Each oxide is present in defined 
proportions. In the latter, the catalyst comprises a zirconia carrier 
having ruthenium and/or rhodium supported thereon; and optionally 
further comprises, as co-catalyst, an element from a group which 
includes rare earths, magnesium, calcium and yttrium. Processes wherein low molecular weight hydrocarbons are 
converted to syn gas within a fluidized bed of catalyst in the 
presence of both steam and oxygen offer particular advantages in that 
the syn gas that is produced can be better controlled at 
hydrogen:carbon monoxide ratios particularly suitable for conducting 
Fischer-Tropsch reactions; i.e. at a hydrogen: carbon monoxide molar 
ratio of about 2:1. Fluidized bed processes offer particular advantages in that 
they provide superior heat, and mass transfer characteristics as 
contrasted with fixed bed processes. They permit substantially 
isothermal reactor conditions in conducting exothermic and endothermic 
reactions, provided that the fluidized characteristics of the bed can  
 
be maintained throughout the operation. The extremely high temperatures 
required for syn gas generation however imposes special constraints 
on the types of bed materials which must, inter alia, resist 
melting and agglomeration which would lead to reduced fluidization 
quality, larger gas bubbles, and inferior mass transfer. The fluidization 
characteristics of the bed, for example, thus depends on the 
ability of particulate oxides, alumina and other refractory materials, 
which serve as bed components, to mechanically withstand the stress 
and strain of process operations. One important pathway to loss
