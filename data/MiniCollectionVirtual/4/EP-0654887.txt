<ABSTRACT>
The uninteruptable power supply, with the common neutral line (N), includes a double boost switching converter (4) the input of which is connected to a battery (2) and to a rectifier circuit (1) connected to the mains. The double boost switching converter includes a positive switching step-up device (L1, T1, D3, D4) supplying a first output voltage (V1) between a positive DC output (7) and the neutral (N), and a negative voltage step-up switching device (L2, T2, D5, D6) supplying a second output voltage (V2) between a negative DC output (8) and the neutral. The control circuit (9) of the double boost switching converter includes means for regulating the imbalance between the output voltages (V1 and V2) of the positive and negative switching converters, suitable both for operating from the mains and for battery operation.
