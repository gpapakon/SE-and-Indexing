<ABSTRACT>
Large optical mirror composite sandwich constructions comprise a honeycomb layer (2) which is bonded to a front (4) and a rear (1) cover layer. On the front cover layer (4) there are located a mirror-supporting layer (5) and a reflection layer (6). In order to avoid the honeycombs pressing through to the reflection layer, a pressure compensation layer (3) of carbon foam is inserted between the honeycomb layer (2) and the front cover layer (4).

Large optical mirror of composite sandwich construction,
comprising the following components:


a) a rear sandwich covering layer (1) of carbon fibre reinforced
plastics material,
b) a honeycomb core (2) of triangular cell cross-section comprising
carbon fibre reinforced plastics material which is adhesively

secured to the front face of the rear sandwich covering layer (1),
c) a pressure distribution layer (3) of foamed carbon or foamed glass
or ceramics foam, which is adhesively secured to the front face of

the honeycomb core, the honeycomb core (2) being pressed a little
way into the rear face of the pressure distribution layer (3),
d) a front covering layer (4) of carbon fibre reinforced plastics material,
which is adhesively secured to the front face of the pressure

distribution layer (3),
e) a mirror supporting layer (5) of glass-ceramics, which is adhesively
secured to the front face of the front covering layer (4), and
f) a metallic reflection layer (6) on the front face of the mirror
supporting layer (5).
