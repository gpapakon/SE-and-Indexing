<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new quinolylbenzofuran 
derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof 
which are useful as a medicament. Some quinolylbenzofuran derivatives have been known 
as described, for example, in J. Chem. Soc., 1964, 173 and 
Chim. Ther., 6, 159 (1971). CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS, vol. 72 (1970), abstract No.31573e 
describes quinoline derivatives having antispasmodic and 
antihistaminic properties. The compound 2-[3-methyl-6-(benzyloxy)benzofuranyl]quinoline 
is mentioned. Z. Chem. 8, 179 (1968) discloses some 
quinolylbenzofuran derivatives, i.e. 2-(benzofuran-2-yl)-4-methylquinoline 
and 2-(benzofuran-2-yl)-4-phenylquinoline. Z. Chem. 18, 400 (1978) discloses some 
quinolylbenzofuran derivatives, i.e. 2-(benzofuran-2-yl)-6-chloro-4-phenylquinoline 
and 2-(3-methylbenzo[b]thien-2-yl)-6-chloro-4-phenylquinoline. This invention relates to new quinolylbenzofuran 
derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. More particularly, it relates to new 
quinolylbenzofuran derivatives and pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts thereof which have activities as  
 
leukotriene and Slow Reacting Substance of Anaphylaxis 
(hereinafter, SRS-A) antagonists or inhibitors, to 
processes for preparation thereof, to a pharmaceutical 
composition comprising the same, and to methods of using 
the same therapeutically in the prevention and/or 
treatment of allergy or inflammation in human beings or 
animals, and more particularly to methods for prevention 
and/or treatment of asthma, psoriasis, hepatitis, 
pancreatitis, arthritis, nephritis, inflammatory bowel 
disease, septic shock, arteriosclerosis, myocardial 
infarction, cerebral vasospasm, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, 
dermatitis, rheumatism, peptic ulcer or gout. One object of this invention is to provide new and 
useful quinolylbenzofuran derivatives and pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts thereof which possess activities as 
leukotriene and SRS-A antagonists or inhibitors. Another object of this invention is to provide 
processes for the preparation of said derivatives and 
salts thereof. A further object of this invention is to provide a 
pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active 
ingredient, said quinolylbenzofuran derivatives and 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The object quinolylbenzofuran derivatives of this 
invention are new and can be represented by the following 
general formula (I) : 
  
 
wherein 
R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, A, X and Yare defined as in 
claim 1,  
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
