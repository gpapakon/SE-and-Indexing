<ABSTRACT>
A gas-fired burner apparatus (2) includes a porous combustion surface (5) disposed in a combustion chamber (8) substantially sealed to prevent entry of secondary combustion air. A subatmospheric pressure is maintained in the combustion chamber (8) by a natural or aspirated draft. The subatmospheric pressure cooperates with an aspirating flow of fuel to the burner apparatus (2) to provide an increased flow of primary combustion air which reduces the combustion temperature and the emission of pollutants. Alternatively, the subatmospheric pressure may be used to achieve a given flow of primary combustion air with a reduced combustion surface area. Water heater (1) and room heater applications of the burner apparatus are illustrated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heaters and in
particular to gas fired heaters.The invention has been developed primarily for use
as a water heater, room heater or the like and will be
described hereinafter with reference to these
applications. However, it will be appreciated that the
invention is not limited to these particular fields of
use.The present invention relates more particularly to
gas-fired heaters having a gas-fired burner in which the
combustion occurs at or near a combustion surface
maintained at subatmospheric pressure. The burner is
operated at conditions which result in primarily
convective heat transfer and reduced emissions of oxides
of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO). Two embodiments of this invention are illustrated.
One embodiment provides a novel and improved water
heater in which improved performance is obtained by
providing the combustion surface in a sealed combustion
chamber maintained at subatmospheric pressure without
the use of powered mechanical fans or blowers. A second
embodiment provides a novel and improved space heater in
which the combustion surface of the burner is maintained
at subatmospheric pressure and is arranged for direct
heat transfer to the surrounding space to be temperature
conditioned.It has now been established that gas burners of all
kinds are known to be a source of indoor pollution
especially in the amounts of oxides of nitrogen (NOx)
formed.NOx is a term used to describe the combined
"Oxides of Nitrogen" and in particular to NO, N2O and
NO2. For example NO and N2O are a concern in the
outdoor environment, in particular with relation to acid
rain, ozone and photochemical smog. NO2 is similarly
a major concern to medical authorities due to its effect
on lung function. This has led to severe restrictions
on the acceptable emission levels of NOx with
particular emphasis on the emission of NO2.The exact amount of air needed to provide complete 
combustion of a given amount of fuel is the
stoichiometric amount of air, and the stoichiometric
ratio is said to be 1. The ratio of air to fuel must
equal or exceed the stoichiometric ratio if combustion
is to be complete. If the primary air flow is at least
the stoichiometric amount, then theoretically no
additional or secondary combustion air is required for
complete combustion. Secondary combustion air generally
complicates the combustion process, leading to
nonuniform combustion areas, hotter or cooler than the
average. Such non-uniformity of combustion leads to
localized production of undesirable
