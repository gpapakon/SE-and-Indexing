<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for preparing enantiomer-pure (beta)-substituted (gamma)-aminobutyric acid derivates and related compounds. A S-pyroglutaminic acid derivate having general formula (II), in which Y stands for a sterically demanding OH-protecting group known per se, is reacted with an organometallic reactive which allows a residue R to be selectively introduced into the 4th position adjacent to the -CH2OY group of the compound having general formula (II). A compound having general formula (III) is thus obtained, from which a series of pharmaceutically interesting compounds may be derived, such as R-baclofen and R-rolipram, while preserving the stereochemical properties of the substituents.

Process for manufacturing enantiomerically pure, β-substituted γ-aminobutyric acid
derivatives of Formula (I)



in which R represents a straight-chain or branched-chain alkyl group with 1 to 6 C atoms, an
alkenyl group with 2 to 6 C atoms or an optionally substituted phenyl radical that can have as

substituents one or two substituents chosen from the halogen atoms F, Cl, Br, I, alkyl radicals
with 1 to 4 C atoms and alkoxy or cycloalkoxy radicals with 1 to 6 C atoms,

characterized in that an S-pyroglutamic acid derivative of the general formula (II)


in which Y represents a sterically discriminating OH protection group, which is itself known,
is reacted with an organometallic reagent that enables a radical R to be introduced selectively

into the 4-position adjacent to the -CH
2
OY group of the compound with the general formula
(II) to yield a compound of the general formula (III)



and from this the compound of the general formula (I) is obtained in the form of an acid addition
salt or in free form by a known gentle abscission of the OH protective group, oxidizing 

the free methylol group that is formed thereby to a carboxyl group and formation of a compound
of the general formula (V),



followed by decarboxylation of this compound of general formula (V) and subsequent hydrolytic
ring-opening of the γ-lactam ring compound of general formula (VI) substituted in the 4

position that is formed thereby


before or after cleaving off the tert-butoxycarbonyl group.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the OH protection group Y is selected
from tert-butyldiphenylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl and trityl radicals.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the organometallic reagents to
introduce the R radical are selected from reagents containing Cu-organic and Zn-organic

compounds.
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in that the Cu-organic or Zn-organic reagent
is chosen from reagents comprising a compound with one of the formulae R2CuMgX, in

which X represents one of the halogen atoms Cl, Br, I, R
2
CuLi, R
2
Zn or R
2
CuZnCl, in each
of which R is defined as in Formula (I).
Process according to one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that in each case R represents
a p-Cl-phenyl radical and the compound of Formula (I) that is obtained is R-Baclofen

(Ie). 
Process according to one of the Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the oxidation of the
methylol group of the compound obtained after splitting off the protective group from the

compound of Formula (III) is carried out using NaIO
4
 in the presence of RuCl
3
 or with gaseous
oxygen in the presence of a platinum metal catalyst.
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in that PtO
2
 is used as the platinum metal
catalyst.
Process according to one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the decarboxylation
of the compound of Formula (V), after it has reacted with isobutyl chloroformate and N-hydroxy-2-thiopyridone,

is carried out photolytically in the presence of tert-butyl mercaptan
(Barton Reaction).
Process according to one of the Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the hydrolytic ring-opening
of the compound of Formula (VI) is carried out by reacting this compound with LiOH

and afterwards splitting off the tert-butoxycarbonyl group to obtain the compound of Formula
(I).
An enantiomerically pure pyroglutamic acid derivative of the general formula (III)


in which R represents a straight-chain or branched-chain alkyl group with 1 to 6 C atoms, an
alkenyl group with 2 to 6 C atoms or an optionally substituted phenyl radical that can have as

substituents one or two substituents chosen from the halogen atoms F, Cl, Br, I, alkyl radicals
with 1 to 4 C atoms and alkoxy or cycloalkoxy radicals with 1 to 6 C atoms, and Y represents

an OH protection group selected from tert-butyldiphenylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl and trityl
radicals.

alkenyl group with 2 to 6 C atoms or an optionally substituted phenyl radical that can have as

substituents one or two substituents chosen from the halogen atoms F, Cl, Br, I, alkyl radicals
