<ABSTRACT>
A filtering medium which is unchanged in the maximum 
pore size even when heating sterilization, high temperature 

filtration, etc. are carried out, yet has a high 
tensile strength, can be processed into pleat-form and 

also is applied to high precision filtration, is provided,
 

   which filtering medium is a product having a nonwoven 
fabric composed of 20 to 80% by weight of lower 

melting point microfine fibers and 80 to 20% by weight 
of higher melting point microfine fibers having a melting 

point higher by 10°C or higher than that of the lower 
melting point microfine fibers, the respective fibers 

being hot-melt-adhered to one another through the lower 
melting point microfine fibers, hot-melt-adhered to 

a hot-melt-adhesive net, and having a maximum pore size 
of 120 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filtering medium used
for precision filtration such as a filter for liquid
used for washing electronic devices or a prefilter for
liquid or gas used for producing medicines. More
particularly, it relates to a filtering medium for
precision filtration, obtained by hot-melt-adhering
a non-woven fabric composed of microfine fibers having
the intersections thereof hot-melt-adhered, to a net
made of hot-melt adhesive fibers, which medium has no
change in the pore diameter due to heating and a superior
processability for pleat form, etc., and a process for
producing the above filtering medium.In recent years, industries directed to electronics,
biochemicals, etc. have been developed, and an opportunity
using a purified gas or liquid for producing these
materials have been increasing. Heretofore, as a filtering
medium for a precision filtration, glass fiber nonwoven
fabrics, synthetic fiber non-woven fabrics
composing of microfine fibers, etc. have been used. 
However, the above glass fiber non-woven fabrics have
such problems that the fabrics are weak to alkali-resistance,
and when they are processed into a pleat
form in order to afford a large surface area for
filtration or processed into various steric shapes,
they are inferior in the so-called shapability, and
so on. On the other hand, the above synthetic fiber
non-woven fabrics have such advantages that they have
a less specific gravity and a lighter weight as compared
with glass fiber non-woven fabrics; the shapability is
better than that of glass fiber non-woven fabrics; they
are cheaper; the material does not scatter away at the
time of processing the filtering medium as in the case
of glass fibers so that they are easily dealt with; and
so on. Thus, the filtering medium of the synthetic fiber
non-woven fabrics has rapidly come to be used broadly.For example document JP-A-2 091 262 discloses a precision filtering medium usable eg as bacteria-barrier
consisting of a non-woven fabric composed of a mixture of 20 to 80% by weight of lower melting point con
jugate fibers mixed with higher melting point microfine fibers having a melting point of 10°C or more higher
than that of the lower melting point fibers. The different fibers are hot-melt-adhered to one another by melt-adhesion
of the lower melting point fibers. For the filtering medium of synthetic non-woven
fabrics, polyester spun bonded non-woven fabrics, polypropylene
melt-blown non-woven fabrics, etc. have been
used, but there is a problem that mesh-openings of the
non-wov
