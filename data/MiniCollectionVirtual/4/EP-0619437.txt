<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed device comprises a main body (
CB
) which is a single piece body having a hollow elongate cylindrical shape, 
and a regulation rod (
BR
). The main body (
CB
) has means (2) for its anchoring at its fixed point and means for the retention 
(
MR
) of the rod (
VR
) which comprise two extensions (5,
5'
) which, at their ends, have respectively a trapezoidal threading (6,
6
) 
and an orthogonal extension (7,
7'
), the extremities of said extensions (7,
7'
) being joined by a circular ring (8) which is coaxial to 
the main or base body (
CB
). The rod (
VR
) is joined to the sheath (9) of the cable (4) and has a threading (12) which matches the 
threadings (6,
6'
) of said extensions (5,
5'
).When adjusting the length of the control cable, the rod (
VR
) is introduced inside the 
main body (
CB
) against the elastic reaction of the retention means (
MR
) which set the position reached by the rod (
VR
). Application 
to the car industry.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the invention is a control cable length 
self-adjusting device which is applicable, in particular, 
to the adjustment of the length of sheathed control 
cables used, in general, in industry and in the 
automobile industry in particular. As is well known, the said control cables are formed, 
basically, by a steel cable having a sleeve or sheath 
appropriate for the anticipated service conditions and 
they are used as a linking member between control means 
and devices of any nature. In automobiles, said control 
cables are used, among other cases and just as one 
example of application, as a linking member between the 
accelerator pedal and the corresponding engine carburetor 
mechanism. Said control cables, further to the sheathed 
steel cable as such, regularly comprise at the ends 
thereof respective connection terminals, the shape of 
which depends on the needs of each particular application 
and, suitably arranged relative to one of the ends of the 
sheathed steel cable portion, a self-adjusting device for 
the length of said sheathed cable portion. The purpose of said self-adjusting device is to 
compensate, for each vehicle in particular, the tolerance 
required by the sheathed cable portion of the control 
cable, with regard to the length thereof, to achieve an 
adequate transmission of the forces and movements.The 
sheathed cable portion length is adjusted, as described 
hereinafter, after the control cable has been suitably 
attached at both ends to the control means (which may be  
 
a lever, a pedal or a control arm) and to the controlled 
device (which may be an automobile carburetor, a lock or 
any other remote controlled mechanism), respectively, and 
after the self-adjusting device has been anchored to a 
fixed point on the vehicle structure. Generally speaking, the known embodiments of self-adjusting 
devices comprise the following members: a base 
body having means for the anchorage thereof to the 
vehicle structure; a regulating rod firmly attached at 
one of the ends thereof to the corresponding end of the 
control cable sheath and through which the steel cable 
may slide; an adjusting spring which, initially, is 
supplied compressed to a pre-set value; and manually 
operated regulating rod retaining means. The length of the sheathed cable portion is adjusted, in 
general, by the self-adjusting devices mentioned in the 
foregoing paragraph in the way described hereinafter. 
With the control cable mounted in the vehicle and said 
control means and controlled device in the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A control cable length self-adjusting device 
comprising a base body (
CB
) and a regulating rod (
VR
), in 
which: 


the base body (
CB
) is provided with retaining means 
(
MR
) acting on the regulating rod (
VR
) and means (2) for 
the firm attachment thereof to a fixed point of the 

vehicle structure; 
the regulating rod (
VR
) is essentially cylindrical and 
is firmly attached at one end (
B'
) thereof to the 
corresponding end (9) of the sheath of the sheathed cable 

portion (4), said rod having an axial through passage 
(15, 16, 10) through which the steel cable (4), having no 

sheath (9), may slide and is provided externally with a 
retaining screw thread (12); 
the base body (
CB
), which is made from plastics 
material of appropriate mechanical strength and 

resilience, is a one-piece member and is essentially an 
elongate hollow cylinder which, at the open end (
B
) 
thereof is provided with the retaining means (
MR
) acting 
permanently on the regulating rod (
VR
), said base body 
(
CB
) being so dimensioned that the regulating rod (
VR
) 
may snugly be slid in the interior thereof; 
and which is characterized in that the other end (
A
) of 
the elongate hollow cylinder is provided with a cover (1) 

having an axial through passage (3) through which the 
steel cable (4), having no sheath (9), may slide and in 

that the retaining means (
MR
) on the base body (
CB
) 
comprises two mutually symmetrical diametrally opposed 

longitudinal extensions (5-
5'
) which are provided 
internally at the respective ends thereof with a 

retaining screw thread (6-
6'
) which is so dimensioned as 
to mate with the regulating rod (
VR
) retaining screw  
 

thread (12) and externally with an orthogonal extension 
(7-
7'
), the respective ends of said two orthogonal 
extensions (7-
7'
) being connected together with a 
circular lock ring (8) coaxial with the base body (
CB
). 
The self-adjusting device of claim 1, characterized 
in that the retaining screw threads (6-
6'
, 12) of the two 
longitudinal extensions (5-
5'
) of the retaining means 
(
MR
) of the base body (
CB
) and regulating rod (
VR
), 
respectively, have a trapezial cross section. 
The self-adjusting device of claims 1 to 2, 
characterized in that at the open end (
B
) of the base 
body (
CB
) and at the inner end (
A'
) of the regulating rod 
(
VR
), which is the end opposite to the one to which the 
sheath (9) of the steel cable (4) is firmly attached, 

there are respective annular positioning shoulders (13, 
14) which set the maximum portion of rod (
VR
) which may 
project beyond the base body (
CB
