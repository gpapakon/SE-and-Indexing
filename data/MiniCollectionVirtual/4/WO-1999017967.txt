<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for supplying hydraulic fluid to a circuit using fluid (1), such as a brake circuit, said device comprising: a first reservoir (2) provided with a dispensing orifice (22); a second reservoir (3) with an intake orifice (31); a first fluid communication (4) set up between the first (2) and second (3) reservoirs and including the first reservoir (2) dispensing orifice (22), a duct (41), and the second reservoir intake orifice; a second fluid communication (5) arranged between the second reservoir (3) and the fluid-using circuit (1); and a level sensor (6) for detecting a fault in hydraulic fluid supply of the fluid-using circuit. The invention is characterised in that the first reservoir (2) is open to the environment atmosphere and the second reservoir (3) is isolated therefrom.
