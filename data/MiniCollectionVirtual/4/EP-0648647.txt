<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for forming an air bag deployment opening in a 
vinyl covered trim piece in which one or more hinged deployment 

door substrates (46A,46B) are formed 
with an upwardly turned rim (48) extending 

about the unhinged sides which exerts a second stage cutting 
pressure on the inside of a covering vinyl layer (10). A first stage 

piercing cutter panel (54) is also hinged along the same side but 
inclined downwardly to be initially contacted by the inflating air 

bag. An array of piercing elements (62) formed on the cutter panel are 
forced through the vinyl covering layer prior to movement of the 

door substrate panel to pierce the covering layer (10) at the center and 
corners of the door pattern prior to progressive cutting by the 

door panel rim (48).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns air bag safety, systems and more 
particularly arrangements for providing air bag deployment openings 
in an interior trim structure, i.e., instrument panels, in which 
the outer surface does not give any visible indication of an air 
bag deployment door or opening. Air bag systems have now come into common use for automotive 
vehicles, in which one or more air bags are stowed in respective 
storage spaces located within the passenger compartment. 
Typically, a driver's side air bag is stored in a receptacle in the 
center of the steering wheel and a passenger's side air bag is 
stored in a receptacle mounted behind the instrument panel. Upon 
detection of a relatively severe collision, the air bag or bags are 
very rapidly inflated and enter the passenger compartment to be 
deployed in positions within the passenger compartment so as to 
cushion the driver and/or passengers from injury which otherwise 
would be caused by impacting the interior structure of the auto. The air bags must be neatly stowed out of sight and so as to 
be resistant to tampering, yet able to deploy into the passenger 
compartment in an instant. These requirements necessitate a sturdy 
closure panel for the deployment opening, preferably installed so 
as to minimize so as to any visual indication of the presence of 
the closure, and yet to reliably open under the wide range of 
ambient temperature conditions for which the auto is designed for 
use, over the entire useful life of the car (or truck). Such closures are usually opened by a force exerted by the 
inflating air bag, and the deployment of the air bag must not be 
appreciably slowed by resistance developed in opening the closure. 
The considerable force applied by the inflating air bag must not 
result in fragmentation or separation of the closure, lest debris 
be projected towards persons in the passenger compartment. The closure is of necessity exposed within the auto interior, 
and thus must be aesthetically compatible with the auto interior  
 
trim. A vinyl skin covering layer is commonly applied to the 
instrument panel and other trim panel surfaces. Plastics such as 
vinyl, while durable, are relatively tough and resistant to 
tearing. There has heretofore been proposed such closures in which 
doors are formed by a substrate panel overlain by a vinyl or 
covering layer skin, with the vinyl severed by the deploying air 
bag forcing the substrate panels against the inside of the covering 
layer. While preweakening of the covering layer has

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for forming an air bag deployment opening 
in a trim piece of a passenger compartment of a vehicle, said trim 

piece having an air bag stored in a canister mounted behind a 
section thereof, the arrangement comprising: 

   a trim piece substrate panel formed with an opening located 
over said air bag canister; 

   at least one deployment door substrate panel fit within said 
opening in said trim piece substrate panel, said door substrate 

panel formed with a plurality of sides, one side thereof hinged to 
said trim piece substrate along the perimeter of said opening, the 

other sides thereof free to allow said door substrate panel to 
swing out of said trim piece substrate opening; 

   a covering layer extending over the outside of said trim piece 
and said door substrate panel; 

   a first stage cutter comprising a cutter panel having sides 
substantially coextensive with said door substrate panel, said 

cutter panel lying inside said door substrate panel and hinged 
along the same side as said door substrate panel, said cutter panel 

initially swung inwardly from said door substrate panel, an array 
of piercing elements extending outwardly from said cutter panel, 

each element having a piercing point located to contact the inside 
of said covering layer at points on said pattern along said door 

substrate panel sides when said cutter panel is swung outward to 
abut said door substrate panel and said piercing points are thereby 

brought into contact with the inside of said covering layers; 
   an out turned perimeter rim formed along the perimeter of said 

other sides of said door substrate panel extending outward to a 
level adjacent to the inside of said covering layer, whereby said 

rim of said door substrate panel can apply a second stage severing 
pressure on said covering layer after penetration by said first 

stage cutter piercing elements in a pattern defined by said other 
unhinged sides thereof as said air bag forces said substrate door 

panel to hinge open upon inflation of said air bag. 
The arrangement according to claim 1 further including a 
first stage cutter comprising a cutter panel having sides 

substantially coextensive with said door substrate panel said 
cutter panel hinged along the same side as said door substrate 

panel to either said door substrate panel or said trim piece 
substrate panels, an array of piercing elements extending upwardly 

from said cutler panel each element having a piercing point located 
to contact the inside of said covering layer at points on said 

pattern defined by said door substrate panel sides when said cutter 
panel is swung upward when said piercing points are brought into 

contact with the inside of said covering layer. 
The arrangement according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said cutter 
panel is mounted to be inclined outwardly from said hinged side to 

be positioned closer to said stored air bag than said door 
substrate panel. 
The arrangement according to claim 3 wherein said door 
substrate panel and said cutter panel are generally rectangular, 

with one hinged side, a free side opposite said hinged side and two 
free connecting sides connecting the ends of the hinged and 

opposite sides thereof, and wherein three cutter elements are 
provided, one formed adjacent each corner formed by said opposite 

side and each of said connecting sides, and one formed intermediate 
the lengths of said opposite side. 
The arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein 
each of said piercing elements extends through corresponding openings 

in said door substrate panel. 
The arrangement according to any one of the foregoing 
claims wherein said door substrate panel rim has a terminal edge 

turned over to present a blunted shape. 
The arrangement according to claim 5 or 6 wherein a second 
deployment door substrate panel is included fit into said trim 

piece substrate opening, said second door substrate panel having a 
plurality of sides, one side thereof hinged to said trim piece 

substrate opening opposite said hinged side of said first mentioned 
door substrate panel, said first mentioned and said second door 

 
substrate panel having a common joined out turned rim extending 

along sides thereof opposite the respective hinged sides of each 
door substrate panel, a series of slots in said common joined rim 

comprising said openings receiving said piercing elements of said 
cutter panel. 
The arrangement according to any one of the foregoing claims 
further
 including a layer of foam interposed between said covering 
layer and said trim piece substrate and said door substrate panel.
