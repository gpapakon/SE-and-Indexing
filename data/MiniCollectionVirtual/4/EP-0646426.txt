<ABSTRACT>
The puller apparatus is intended for extrusion presses with a delivery track (1) to provide support for the elongate workpiece (2) ejected from the extrusion press. The workpiece (2) can be gripped at the end by a gripper (16, 17) which can be moved by the puller apparatus. Two rails (5, 6) spaced apart from one another and situated laterally with respect to an imaginary vertical longitudinal centre plane (7) of the delivery track (1) are fixed parallel to and above the delivery track (1). A respective carriage (8, 9) can be moved along each rail (5, 6). An arm (12, 13) carrying a gripper (16, 17) is arranged on each of the two carriages (8, 9). The arms (12, 13) are of one-piece configuration and can be pivoted about horizontal axes (10, 11) lying at right angles to the direction of ejection of the extrusion press. The horizontal limbs of these arms (12, 13) of identical design, said limbs carrying the grippers (16, 17), point towards the vertical longitudinal centre plane (7) of the delivery track (1).
