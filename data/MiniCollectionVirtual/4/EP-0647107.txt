<ABSTRACT>
An IV rack (10) is a frame (20) having spaced horizontal bars (22, 23, 24, 25). IV containers (31) are hung from the top bar (22). Pumps (35) are mounted between the lower bars (24 and 25). Conductors (50) and accessible contacts (51) for the respective pumps (35) are mounted in and form a part of the IV rack (10) so that the pumps (35) can be connected to a single DC power supply (61) and a single AC power supply.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relaxes to an IV rack. The
rack is generally of the type disclosed in U. S.
Patent No. 4,795,122 and US-A-5 117 521.In critical care situations, an IV rack of
the type disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,795,122 is
used in order to supply the patient with the multiple
fluids that may be required as dictated by the patient's
condition. Such fluids include heparin,
nitroglycerin, antibiotics, nutrients and the like.
In extreme situations, such as those involving burn
patients, as many as twelve to fifteen IV infusions
with twelve to fifteen pumps may be required.Each pump is connected to an electrical
outlet that provides 110 volts to drive the pumps.
The pump housing contains a DC power supply that is
utilized to keep the pump operating when the 110 volt
AC power supply is disconnected, as, for example, when
a patient is transferred from his hospital room to 
another location in the hospital for diagnosis or
treatment.The current hardware and practices suffer
major disadvantages. The multiple conductors connecting
the pumps to 110 volt AC outlets add to the
general untidiness and complexity of the equipment
surrounding the patient. Further, the DC power supply
that is mounted in each pump housing substantially
doubles the required size of the power supply and pump
combination and greatly increases the weight of the
combination. All of this in turn provides a practical
limit for the number of pumps and power supplies to be
mounted on an IV rack which must be transported with
the patient from time to time.U.S. Patent 4352991 describes a life support
system with a support structure carrying a DC power
supply and plural support units such as a defibrillator
and IVAC intravenous administration components. The
structure provides bin locations for receiving the units,
each location having a power point connectable to a
contact on a unit held therein.An objective of the present invention has
been to provide an IV rack for pumps and IV containers
wherein the combination is greatly simplified. Infusion apparatus in accordance with the
invention comprises a support, a rectangular frame with
means for receiving and supporting containers of IV
fluids and pumps for dispensing the IV fluids and being
formed with an upper rectangular part and a lower
rectangular part, the frame being removably
mountable to the support, and a conductor for connecting
a source of electrical power to supply electrical
contacts mounted in the lower rectangular part of
the frame spaced from the support, wherein
the apparatus is an

Apparatus comprising a support (12, 17), a
rectangular frame (20) with means (30, 33, 38, 45, 46)

for receiving and supporting containers (31) of IV fluids
and pumps (35) for dispensing the IV fluids and being

formed with an upper rectangular frame part and a lower
rectangular frame part, the frame (20) being removably

mountable to the support, and a conductor (50, 56) for
connecting a source of electrical power to supply

electrical contacts (51) mounted in the lower rectangular

part of the frame (20) spaced from the support
(12, 17), wherein the apparatus is an

infusion apparatus, the upper frame part being provided
with a plurality of hooks (30) extending from the top of

the frame part, each hook configured to support a
container (31) of IV fluid and the apparatus including the

plurality of pumps (35) mounted in the lower rectangular
part of the frame (20), each pump (35) having projecting

electrical contacts (41), the supply contacts (51) being
mounted in a position such that the pump contacts (41)

engage the supply contacts (51) when a pump is mounted
on the lower frame part below a respective container

whereby the supply
contacts (51) can receive electrical power from the

source through the conductor (50, 60) for energizing the
pumps through the pump contacts (41) and in that a

plurality of passageways (33) extend between the upper
and lower frame parts adjacent the contacts (51) to

allow for passage of tubing between a respective IV
container (31) and an associated pump (35). 
Infusion apparatus as claimed in
Claim 1 wherein the frame (20) includes a horizontal bar

(24), and the supply contacts (51) are mounted in the
horizontal bar (24).
Infusion apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 wherein
the frame includes a second horizontal bar (45), and the

pumps (35) are received between the pair of horizontal
bars (24, 45).
Infusion apparatus as claimed in any preceding
Claim wherein the conductor (50, 56) connects the supply

contacts (51) to an AC power source.
Infusion apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims
1 to 5 wherein the conductor (50, 56) connects the supply

contacts (51) to a DC power source (61, 77).
Infusion apparatus as claimed in Claim 5 wherein
the DC power source is a battery (61, 77) mounted in the

frame (20) or on a care cart (17).
Infusion apparatus as claimed in any preceding
Claim wherein the frame (20) includes a controller (71)

for controlling the pumps. 
Infusion apparatus as claimed in any preceding
Claim wherein each pump (35) is mounted with a motor (43)

for driving the pump in a housing (36), the pump contacts
(41) being exposed on the housing and connected to the

motor (43) by leads (42).
Infusion apparatus as claimed in any preceding
Claim wherein the conductor comprises a bus (50).
