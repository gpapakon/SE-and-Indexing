<ABSTRACT>
In a method for transmitting a message from a source subscriber station (11..) to a destination subscriber station (11..) in a communications network (12), a configuration service which can be started from a specified subscriber station (11.4) sets the subscriber station (11..) either as repeater station or then as non-repeater station of the communications network (12). The message, which has been provided by the source subscriber station (11..) with a credit value before a first transmission, is retransmitted by a subscriber station (11..), which has been set as repeater station, only if its credit value is not equal to zero, the credit value being reduced by a specific amount each time the message is transmitted. The configuration service ensures that two subscriber stations (11..), set as repeater stations, are so far apart from one another in the communications network (12) that no disturbing interference is produced on the transmission medium by the transmission.

A method of transmitting a message from a source subscriber
station (11) to a destination subscriber station (11) in a communication

network (12) having a plurality of samples (11.1; 11.2; 11.3: 11.4) of the
subscriber station (11), which are connected to a common transmission

medium (2) and which are in the form of transmitting and receiving stations
for the message characterised by a configuration service which can be

started from a predetermined subscriber station (11.4) and by which the
subscriber stations (11) are connected either as a repeater station or then

as a non-repeater station of the communication network (12), wherein the
configuration service ensures that in a group with a plurality of samples

of the subscriber station (11) which are connected to the transmission
medium (2) close together in such a way that when the group is

synchronously transmitting interference phenomena which disturb the
transmission are produced, at most one single subscriber station (11) is

switched as a repeater station, wherein the message is provided with a
predetermined credit value prior to a first emission by the source

subscriber station (11), wherein a subscriber station (11) which is set as
a repeater station emits the received message again if the credit value

thereof is not zero, wherein the credit value is reduced by a given amount
with each emission of the message, and wherein a subscriber station (11)

which is set as a non-repeater station does not emit the received message
again.
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that

the configuration service occupies at least one time window (TS; TS
1
;
TS
2
) which has a predetermined number (n) of answer positions (t
A
), wherein
an answer position (t
k
) is precisely associated with an address (A
k
) of a
subscriber station (11), 
the subscriber station (11), from the start of the configuration
service to the time of the answer position (t
A
) associated with the
subscriber station (11) attempts to receive an answer signal of a sample of

the subscriber station (11), which precedes in the selected address order,
when the answer signal of the preceding sample has been received at
least with a level exceeding a predetermined threshold (U
T
) the subscriber
station (11) is switched as a non-repeater station and does not send an

answer signal during the configuration service, and
when the answer signal of all preceding samples of the subscriber
station (11) is received by the subscriber station with a level below the

predetermined threshold (U
T
) the subscriber station (11) is switched as a
repeater station and during the configuration service emits the answer

signal at the time of the answer position (t
T
) of the subscriber station
(11).
A method according to a preceding claim characterised in that the
configuration service is triggered by the emission of an information frame

wherein the information frame has a command code which can be interpreted
as a call-up for the configuration and at least one further information

unit which is dependent on the address region of the samples of the
subscriber station (11), which are to be configured.
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to one of claims
1 to 3 comprising a plurality of samples (11.1; 11.2; 11.3; 11.4) of a

subscriber station (11), which has a process computer (3) connected to the
transmission medium (2) by way of a modulator/demodulator (1) and at least

one matching circuit (6; 7; 8; 9), connected to the process computer (3),
for a data terminal (13) or for a unit (15) which is over the subscriber

station (11), characterised in that the process computer has a
configuration memory (4) which is also manually variable by means of an

operating element (5), that a binary state can be stored in the
configuration memory (4) and that on the basis of the content of the 

configuration memory (4) the subscriber station (11) either again emits or
then does not again emit a message provided with credit.
