<ABSTRACT>
A stabilized solid controlled release formulation 
having a coating derived from an aqueous dispersion of a 

hydrophobic polymer is obtained by overcoating a substrate 
including an active agent selected from the group consisting 

of a systemically active therapeutic agent, a locally 
active therapeutic agent, a disinfecting and sanitizing 

agent, a cleansing agent, a fragrance agent and a fertilizing 
agent, with an aqueous dispersion of the plasticized 

hydrophobic polymer and then curing the coated substrate at 
a temperature above the glass transition temperature of the 

plasticized hydrophobic polymer, until a curing endpoint is 
reached at which the coated substrate provides a stabilized 

dissolution of the active agent which is unchanged after 
exposure to accelerated storage conditions, the endpoint 

being determined by comparing the dissolution profile of 
the formulation immediately after curing to the dissolution 

profile of the formulation after exposure to accelerated 
storage conditions of at least one month at a temperature 

of 37°C and at a relative humidity of 80%.

<DESCRIPTION>
An important aspect of the manufacture, regulatory
review and approval of all dosage forms concerns their
stability over extended periods of time. The stability
data obtained with regard to a particular dosage form
directly affects its shelf-life. The stability of a
pharmaceutical dosage form is related to maintaining its
physical, chemical, microbiological, therapeutic, and
toxicological properties when stored, i.e., in a particular
container and environment. Stability study requirements
are covered, e.g., in the Good Manufacturing Practices
(GMPs), the U.S.P., as well as in the regulatory requirements
of the country where approval to market a dosage form
is being sought. In the United States, a request to test,
and eventually market, a drug or a drug formulation may be
made via a New Drug Application (NDA), an Abbreviated New
Drug Application (ANDA) or an Investigational New Drug
Applications (IND).The agents used in sustained release dosage formulations
often present special problems with regard to their
physical stability during storage. For example, waxes
which have been used in such formulations are known to
undergo physical alterations on prolonged standing, thus
precautions are taken to stabilize them at the time of
manufacture or to prevent the change from occurring. Fats
and waxy materials when used in purified states are known
to crystallize in unstable forms, causing unpredictable
variations in availability rates during stability testing
at the time of manufacture and during later storage.It is known that certain strategies can be undertaken
to obtain stabilized controlled release formulations in
many cases, such as insuring that the individual agents are
in a stable form before they are incorporated into the product, 
and that processing does not change this condition,
retarding the instability by including additional additives,
and inducing the individual agents of the dosage
form to reach a stable state before the product is finally
completed.It is also recognized that the moisture content of the
product can also influence the stability of the product.
Changes in the hydration level of a polymeric film, such as
the ethyl celluloses, can alter the rate of water permeation
and drug availability. Also, binders such as acacia
are known to become less soluble when exposed to moisture
and heat. However, moisture content of a product can be
controlled fairly successfully by controls in the processing
method and proper packaging of the product.Hydrophobic polymers such as certain cellulose
