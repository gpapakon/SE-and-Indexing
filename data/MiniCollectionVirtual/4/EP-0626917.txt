<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITE FAN BLADEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to propfans used in propulsion systems, and more particularly to fan blades in small, high speed propfan turbine engines.Prior art turbine fan blades have generally been constructed entirely of metal which is cast or machined into an assembly to be powered by an engine drive mechanism. However, an all-metallic blade has the drawbacks of the blade tending to be heavy. The blade can also have a relatively low modulus/density ratio leading to reduced aerodynamic performance due to blade tip deflections and blade untwist.One solution to this problem is to provide a fan blade of composite fiber construction. A composite fan blade has a lower weight and a greater modulus/density ratio than a metal blade. Reduced weight in a gas turbine engine component increases flight time and lowers inertial response time. A higher modulus/density ratio improves aerodynamic performance.The strength of the composite material derives from the fibers utilized therein. A composite design must optimize the orientations of the fiber loading in order to achieve maximum benefit of the composite design. However, the problem inherent with a fan blade arrangement is the fan blade requires strength in the radial direction, and the fan support disk requires strength in the tangential direction. An integral composite fan design would thus require a very complicated three-dimensional fiber weave in order to tailor the fiber orientations to the structural requirements of the fan blade and support disk. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved fan blade and method of making the same which reduces the weight of a turbine engine and increases engine performance. It is another object of the present invention to provide a fan blade made of composite fibers which does not 

require complex orientation of the composite fibers to provide sufficient blade strength.It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of making a composite fan blade which does not require complex orientation of the composite fibers to provide sufficient blade strength.The present invention provides a composite fan blade comprising a metal support disk having a plurality of hinge lugs formed therein, a bushing means, and a fan blade formed from a first set of radially oriented unidirectional layers of fibers. The metal support disk is connected to an engine drive mechanism. The first set of layers of fibers are

I CLAIM:
1. A composite fan blade for a propfan engine comprising: a support disk having a plurality of hinge lugs formed therein, said disk being connected to an engine drive means; a bushing element; a fan blade formed from a first set of radially oriented unidirectional layers of fibers, said first set of layers of fibers being wrapped around said bushing element to form an elongated front side, an elongated back side, and a portion encompassing said bushing element; a blade platform formed from a second set of unidirectional layers of fibers having a first and a second end which are both wrapped around respective resin filler elements to form resin filled support pockets, said second set of unidirectional layers of fibers being wrapped around the portion of the fan blade encompassing said bushing element to place the resin filled support pockets against the portion of the fan blade encompassing said bushing element, wherein said fan blade and said blade platform form a fan blade assembly, said fan blade assembly having a plurality of hinge slots formed therein; and a pin element extending through the hinge formed by said plurality of hinge lugs in said support disk and said plurality of hinge slots in said fan blade assembly for attaching said fan blade assembly to said support disk.
2. The composite fan blade of Claim 1 wherein said support disk is metallic.
3. The composite fan blade of Claim 1 further comprising a layer of cloth fiber wrapped around the outer surface of said first set of unidirectional layers of fibers, said layer of cloth fiber extending between said fan blade and 


said blade platform, wherein said layer of cloth fiber on said front side of said fan blade is stitched through said first set of unidirectional layers of fibers to said layer of cloth fiber on said back side of said fan blade.
4. The composite fan blade of Claim 1 wherein said fan blade assembly is pressure molded to form a desired blade shape.
5. A method of making a composite fan blade comprising the steps of: a) wrapping a first set of radially oriented unidirectional layers of fibers around a bushing element to form an elongated front side, an elongated back side, and a portion encompassing said bushing element; b) wrapping a first and second end of a second set of unidirectional layers of fibers around respective resin filler elements to form a resin filled support pocket at each end of said second set of unidirectional layers of fibers; c) wrapping said second set of unidirectional layers of fibers around said first set of layers of fibers such that the support pockets are placed against the portion of said first set of unidirectional layers of fibers encompassing said bushing element, thereby forming a fan blade assembly; d) forming a plurality of hinge slots in the bushing element, the portion of said first set of layers of fibers encompassing said bushing element, and said second set of layers of fibers; and e) attaching the fan blade assembly to a support disk having a plurality of hinge lugs formed therein by extending a pin element through a hinge formed by said plurality of hinge lugs in said support disk and said plurality of hinge slots in said fan blade assembly. 


 6. The method of Claim 5 further comprising after step b) the steps of wrapping a layer of cloth fiber around said first set of unidirectional layers of fibers; and stitching said layer of cloth fiber on the elongated front side through said first set of unidirectional layers of fibers to said layer of cloth fiber on the elongated back side.
7. The method of Claim 5 further comprising after step c) the step of pressure molding the fan blade assembly to form a desired blade shape.
