Next, there is the step of automatically producing an adjustment to 

the gain to the processor 603 by the qualitative tuning system 500 

based on the information. Then, there is the step of controlling 
the flow of air through the fume hood 14 with the processor 603 

based on the gain it receives from the qualitative tuning system 
500. The present invention pertains to a method for qualitatively 

tuning a processor 603. The present invention additionally

mechanism 603 for controlling air flow through the fume hood 14 

based on sash 601 position and air flow face velocity. The system

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to controllers. More
specifically, the present invention is related to a method, system
and an apparatus for fume hood controllers. The controllers can be
networkable, or qualitatively tuned or based on face velocity and
sash position of the fume hood.Laboratories wherein dangerous experiments or processes
are performed require protection for the workers and the
experiments in the laboratory. One very common protection found in
laboratories are fume hoods in which chemical reactions are
conducted. The fume hoods have air drawn out of them thus
essentially preventing any toxic fumes from escaping the fume hood
into the laboratory and threatening the operators. The velocity of
air drawn through the fume hood sash is controlled to a value high
enough to maintain safety for the operator and low enough to
provide non-turbulent air for the experiment of process.An additional protection that can be provided is to
maintain the static pressure in the laboratory at a lower or higher
pressure than the pressure in the surrounding corridors of the
building. A lower pressure would prevent contaminants from exiting
the laboratory in the case of an accident.A higher pressure would prevent contaminants from
entering the laboratory, as is the case in a clean room. Also,
control of the laboratory climate is required both for operator
comfort and for certain experiments or processes where strict
temperature and humidity control are necessary. Moreover, in regard to the tuning of a processor,
for instance, for fume hoods, there exists
automatically tunable processors which respond to the
system into which they are integrated. But after the
processor is initially tuned to its system, to tune it
in terms of how a user would like the processor to
respond with respect to the system, the user must be
fluent in operation of the operating system of the
processor in order to retune it.There are many schemes and apparatuses that
provide such control and protection to laboratories.
However, heretofore, there have been no systems that
provide for integrated direct digital control of
laboratories. Additionally, there have been no systems
that are automatically tunable based on simple manual
inputs to the system.US-A-5115728 discloses a system whereby the
pressure of a room containing one or more fume hoods,
such as a laboratory, is to be maintained at a
predetermined level relative to the pressure of a
reference space in the building, which may be the
pressure in an adjacent corridor or an adjacent room
