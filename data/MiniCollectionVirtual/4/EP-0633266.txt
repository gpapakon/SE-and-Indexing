<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 16-membered macrolide
derivatives effective on Gram-positive bacteria and other
bacteria and to a novel process for producing the same.Macrolide antibiotics effective on, for example,
Gram-positive bacteria, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia, are
regarded as clinically important antimicrobial drugs since
they can be orally administered and have low toxicity. In
order to improve their clinical availability, research groups
in various countries have been positively conducting studies
on derivatives of 16-membered macrolide antibiotics. Several
derivatives of 16-membered macrolides have been synthesized
by acylating hydroxyl groups at specific positions for
improving their antimicrobial activities in vitro and/or
pharmacokinetics. Particularly, miokamycin [Journal of
Antibiotics, 29(5), 536 (1976) and Japanese Journal of
Antibiotics, 35(6), 1462 (1982)] has been frequently used
clinically, mainly in the field of pediatrics, as a
semisynthetic 16-membered macrolide antibiotic, because of
its excellent pharmacokinetics and little bitterness in
comparison with natural compounds. Recently, studies on the
development of the derivatives have been directed mostly 
toward introduction of substituted amino groups into a
lactone ring a 16-membered macrolide [Journal of Antibiotics,
44(4), 448 (1991)], deoxylation of specific hydroxyl groups
[Journal of antibiotics, 45(1), 144 (1992)] or alkylation of
hydroxyl groups which is significant in terms of
pharmacokinetics. The 16-membered macrolide antibiotics are
advantageous in that: (1) resistance to these antibiotics is
scarcely induced; (2) they exert less interaction with other
drugs; (3) they show less affect on the intestinal tract; and
(4) they give little irritation at the oral administration.
In view of these characteristics, the present inventors have
selected 16-membered macrolide antibiotics as a research
subject and have conducted studies on the screening of a
compound which shows excellent effects on various Gram-positive
bacteria, by means of synthetic chemical and
biochemical approaches.Firstly, the present inventors have found a synthetic
process for introducing a methyl group to a tertiary hydroxyl
group at the 3''-position of a 16-membered macrolide as a
methodology for the improvement of its antimicrobial activity
in vitro based on the chemical structure of L-chladinose
which is a constituent sugar of erythromycin. Tatsuta et al.
have reported the synthesis of another 16-membered macrolide
having a methylated hydroxyl group at
