<ABSTRACT>
Described is an injection moulded children's building block, designed as 
a toy for all types of large size and different format children's 

construction. It consists of a block (figure 1) having a surface with 
several interior walls, and an independent crossbar (figure 2) which 

incorporates a rectangular section and a flexible wedge (2.1) at one end. 
The crossbars (figure 2) fit into the side wall slots (1.3) of the block, in 
order to join up the blocks together so that flat surfaces are formed 

which will then fit face to face into other similar flat surfaces by means 
of vertical spigots (1.6) located on the inside wall of the blocks on which 

there are slots or cut out guides (1.4), a groove which allows the block 
to be folded in two (1.2), and several openings to allow the fitting of 

decorative pieces to the outside surface of the block.

<DESCRIPTION>
The utility model herein refers to a building block for children's construction, 
made of plastic and having a configuration and method of operation designed 
so as to permit all the necessary functions for the different parts of any 
construction to be brought together in a single piece. The application of the utility model herein is as a toy for all types of 
children's construction, essentially of large dimensions, play houses of all 
sizes, shapes or styles, castles, play pens, scenery, dividers, etc. The fitting system is a male female type, and is carried out by an 
independent crossbar which is manually fitted into side slots (1.3) of two 
blocks, thus securing one to the other. A set of blocks together form a flat 
surface, the inside face of which will fit onto the inside face of another 
similar flat surface with the same number of blocks, forming a strong secure 
double wall without the irregularities of the inner walls of the blocks. The openings (1.1) on the surfaces of the blocks allow the fitting of 
decorative pieces of multiple shapes, colours or sizes, imitating bricks, 
stones, tiles, different types of wood and other types of covering. The grooves on the inner surface of the block (1.4) marked vertically, 
horizontally and diagonally, are to allow the block to be cut into different 
parts which can be adapted to the gable ends, doors, windows, and the ends 
of the walls or roof. The groove marked on the central axis of the outside of the block (1.2), 
allows the block to be folded at the middle to either side so as to obtain the 
interior and exterior corners of the walls or roof. The spaces (1.8) opened up 
in the centre of each of the three walls perpendicular to this groove allow the 
block to be folded inwards.
 
These two processes of cutting and folding, and the three herein above 
mentioned fitting systems, characterize the method of operation of the herein 
utility model. With regard to its shape, the herein utility model consists of a body of two 
elements, a block (figure 1), and crossbar (figure 2), made of injection 
moulded plastic.  The block (figure 1) has a square or rectangular configuration with four side 
walls that are perpendicular to the surface and located at the edge of the 
piece, and two inner walls which cross at the centre of the block and divide it 
into four equal squares or rectangles. Each of these walls has two vertical 
slots opened up at a 1/4 and 3/4 distance along the length of the wall, and 
two perpendicular extensions (1.5) which connect each

<CLAIMS>
Children's building block, consisting of a body of two elements, a block 
(figure 1) and crossbar (figure 2) made of plastic, which fit together to allow 

the joining and fastening of several blocks to each other from all of the side 
walls of the block to form flat surfaces of different sizes and shapes intended 

for the construction of play houses and other large dimension children's 
constructions, characterized by the Block (figure 1) being formed as a square 

or rectangular piece with equidistant openings (1.1) over all of its surface, 
incorporating a groove (1.2) on the outside face which folds the block in two, 

and incorporates on its inner face four grooves (1.4) or cut out guides 
marked vertically horizontally and diagonally, four side walls perpendicular 

to the surface located on the edges of the piece, and two inner walls which 
cross at the centre and divide the block in four equal squares or rectangles. 
Children's building block, in accordance with the previous claim, 
characterized by each of the walls incorporating two vertical slots (1.3) 

opened up at a 1/4 and 3/4 distance along its length and two perpendicular 
extensions (1.5) connecting each slot to another identical slot of a size and 

shape that allow the fitting of the crossbars (figure 2), two vertical spigots 
(1.6) protruding from each of the four side walls and placed at the right of 

each slot and several raised bars (1.7) on the inner side of each of the four 
side walls and placed on the left of each slot, and a slight space (1.8) which 

divides in the middle each of the three walls perpendicular to the central 
groove of the outside face of the block. 
Children's building block, in accordance with the claims 1 and 2, 
characterized by a Crossbar (figure 2) being constituted of a rectangular 

piece of size and shape which adapts to the slots of the walls of the block 
(figure 1) and, incorporating at one end a flexible wedge (2.1) for fastening, 

incorporating at the other end a raised fixed point (2.2) for handling and 
fastening.
