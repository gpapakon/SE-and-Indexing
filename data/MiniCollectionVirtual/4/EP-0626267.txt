<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet recording apparatus comprises a 
carriage (2) movable in a given direction with a recording 

head (1) which is detachably mountable on it and provided 
with discharge ports for discharging liquid. The 

apparatus is arranged to include a sensor (21) for detecting 
the presence or absence of the carriage (2), the recording 

head (1), and at least one of the ink containers. This 
sensor  (21) is provided for the main body of the apparatus 

and positioned within the movable range of the 
carriage (2). With this arrangement, it is possible to 

simplify the structure required for detecting whether 
or not these vital elements for recording are installed 

without any auxiliary power-supply or memory means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink tank according to
claim 1. Moreover, the present invention relates to
an ink jet recording apparatus according to claim 3 and to a
method for detecting an ink amount in an ink tank according to
claim 8.From the document PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol.012 no. 120 (M-685),
14 April 1988 & JP-A-62 246 740 (CANON INC) 27 October
1987 a generic ink tank is known. In order to detect the amount
of ink remaining in the ink tank, a blocking float disposed
within the ink tank reflects the incident light back towards
the source. This is detected by the light receiving element as
an absence of light which provides an indication as to the
amount of ink remaining in the ink tank.There has been known an ink jet recording
apparatus for recording by discharging fine ink
droplets. This apparatus is advantageous over the
apparatuses of other types because of its higher
recording speed, easier recording in color, capability
of recording not only on a regular sheet, but also on a
cloth or other media, a lesser noise, and a higher
quality among other features.In general, the recording head of an ink jet
recording apparatus has ink discharging ports of one to
approximately 200 or 1,000 to approximately 2,000 in
order to record on the entire recordable area, while
allowing the head to scan a recording medium
correlatively. The main scan is such that the carriage 
on which the recording head is mounted reciprocates to
scan for the correlative movement. The subscan is such
that a recording medium is scanned in one way in
relation to the recording head. Here, the recording
head mounted on the carriage is arranged detachably
from the carriage or an ink tank which contains ink to
be supplied to the recording head is arranged
detachably from the recording head.In the former arrangement, the recording head is
replaced with a normal one for use if any malfunction
takes place in the head or replaced with a new one
completely when ink is finished in case of a recording
head being arranged integrally with an ink tank.In the latter arrangement, only the ink tank can
be replaced with a new ink tank for use while the
recording head remains unchanged when ink is finished.
However, since the head or the ink tank or both are
detachably mounted on the carriage, whether or not the
recording head or the ink tank is installed correctly
must be examined manually by the user or automatically
by the apparatus itself for confirmation when executing
a recording operation.An examination of the kind by a user tends
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An ink tank (320) for use in an ink jet recording
apparatus, containing ink to be discharged from a recording

head, comprising

an ink supply section (336) for supplying ink to the
outside of said ink tank, and
parts (341, 342) provided on a portion of a predetermined
wall of a plurality of walls constituting said ink tank, said

parts (341, 342) are inclined with respect to each other, light (310) emitted
from the outside of said ink tank (320)

is reflected by
one (341) of said inclined

parts (341, 342) to another (342) of
said inclined parts (341, 342) and said other part (342)

reflects the light (310) outside of said ink tank (320), wherein
an amount of light reflected by said inclined parts (341,

342) varies in accordance with the ink amount at at least one of said inclined
parts in said ink tank.
An ink tank according to claim 1, wherein one of said other
parts reflects the light (310) in a direction substantially

opposed to said incident direction of the light (310).
An ink jet recording apparatus capable of mounting said
ink tank according to claim 1 or 2, said apparatus comprising:

which is provided with discharge ports for discharging ink, and
said ink tank (320); and 
a sensor (321) for detecting the presence or absence of at
least one of said carriage (351), said recording head (350) and

said ink tank (320),
said sensor (321) being provided on the main body of the

4, wherein said carriage (351) comprises a plural number of

recording heads (350) and wherein one color of said ink is
