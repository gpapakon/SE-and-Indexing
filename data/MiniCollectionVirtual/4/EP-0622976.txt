<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a ballast circuit for 
fluorescent lamps that includes a high frequency trap and 

an impedance-transforming network which is coupled to the 
AC power source by the trap and which can be connected to 

the lamp or lamps, or other non-linear or negative 
resistance load. The trap comprises a parallel-resonant 

combination of an inductor and a capacitor and resonates 
at a selected frequency to cause a switching-circuit 

transistor or transistors to switch at times when the 
level of the current therein and/or the voltage developed 

across the circuit is zero. The frequency is, 
preferably, slightly higher than a harmonic frequency of 

the AC power source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
energy conversion for lighting generally and more
particularly to an electronic ballast suitable for use
with gaseous-discharge lamps or other non-linear or
negative-resistance loads.Gaseous-discharge lamps, i.e. lamps in which
light is generated when an electric current or
discharge is passed through a gaseous medium, are well
known to the lighting field. Fluorescent-type
gaseous-discharge lamps have been employed for years
to provide relatively efficient indoor lighting, such
as for office buildings.Unlike incandescent lamps, which are self-current
limiting as a result of their positive-resistance
characteristics, gaseous-discharge lamps have a
negative-resistance characteristic. For this reason,
gaseous-discharge lamps are operated in conjunction
with a ballast, which provides the requisite current
limiting. Traditionally, ballasts are of core and
coil construction. One form is that of a simple choke
which provides an inductive impedance for current
limiting. Another form is that of a transformer. The
transformer form permits voltage conditioning, such as
providing a high break-down potential, which is
required for starting instant-start-type fluorescent
lamps by ionizing to a plasma the gas therein. For
rapid-start-type fluorescent lamps, the transformer 
includes a pair of windings for energizing the lamp
filaments and separated by a high-voltage winding
having a high reactance for current limiting.
Additionally, a magnetic shunt may be included in the
transformer to limit the energy transferred through
the magnetic path.Unfortunately, traditional core-and-coil-type
ballasts are relatively inefficient due to substantial
heat generated losses that are generally equally
divided between copper losses in the coil and core
losses in the relatively inexpensive grades of iron
employed therein. For example, a traditional
core-and-coil-type ballast employed in a dual forty
watt lamp fixture may dissipate from ten to fifteen
watts, causing the ballast to run hot. Further, in
many applications, such as in office buildings, this
ballast-generated heat must be removed by air
conditioning equipment, which is itself relatively
inefficient. Another problem is that core-and-coil-type
ballasts are relatively heavy in weight
thereby requiring that associated fixtures be
substantial in size and strength.The regulation afforded by traditional core-and-core-type
ballasts is also relatively poor.
Typically, the operating level of fluorescent fixtures
employing such ballasts
