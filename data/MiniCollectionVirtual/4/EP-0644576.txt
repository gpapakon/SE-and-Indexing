<ABSTRACT>
A gas analyzing system that includes a vacuum 
chamber containing a mass spectrometer and a sampling 

device for introducing a gas sample into the chamber. A 
sorption pump is operatively connected to the chamber 

which is capable of maintaining the chamber at a high 
vacuum. The pump includes a diffusion barrier that 

provides smooth pumping characteristics and repeatable 
short term system behavior when sample pulses are 

introduced into the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to gas analyzing system comprising, inter alia, a mass spectrometer utilizing an improved
sorption pump for maintaining the vessel containing the mass spectrometer at
a high vacuum. More specifically, the invention relates to a portable
analytical module that includes a mass spectrometer and an improved sorption
pump that is removably connected to a service module.For the most part, sorptions pumps cannot maintain the high vacuum pressure
required in many analytical process applications and exhibit erratic pumping
characteristics both in terms of short term and long term usage. The pumping
speed generally falls off rather rapidly as the sorptive materials absorb active
gas. Similary, the ability of the pump to adapt to rapid changes in sample
compositions is extremely poor. Furthermore, sorption pumps in present use
cannot be regenerated in situ and thus, must be changed on a regular basis.
Safe handling of the sometimes hazardous sorptive materials during
changeover can also pose problems.In United Kingdom application GB-A-2,249,662 there is described a portable mass
spectrometer system that includes a gas chromatograph and a mass analyzer
housed within a vacuum chamber. A high vacuum ion pump is also housed
within the portable system. The pump consumes a good deal of the total
electrical energy available and places a heavy load on the system's batteries
and restricts the amount of time that is available for sampling in the field.US-A-36 38 401 discloses a vacuum connector for connecting replaceable
evacuated devices to an evacuated system. The connector includes two
membranes, serially disposed between the atmosphere and the evacuated
system, for example a mass spectrometer. The evacuated device is using a
ion-vacuum pump. A sorption pump is interconnected to the region between
the membranes and has the task to produce a differential pressure, having a
value between the pressure values of the atmosphere and of of the evacuated
device. It is therefore an object of the invention to improve mass spectrometry.A further object of the invention is to improve mass spectrometry through
utilization of a sorption pump having a substantial constant pumping speed
over the life of the sorptive material.A still further object of the present invention is to provide a portable mass
spectrometer that utilizes a 
sorption pump to maintain the vacuum chamber housing the
instrument at a high vacuum pressure.Another object of the present invention is to
smooth the pumping characteristics
