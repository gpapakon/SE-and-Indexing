<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image correcting camera capable of
correcting movement of an image due to movement of hands at the time of
photographing. In this specification, the term 'image correcting' is
synonymous with 'image stabilizing'.There are known image correcting cameras which have an image
correcting device for correcting movement of an image due to movement of
hands at the time of photographing. When a vibration sensor provided in such
a camera detects vibrations, the image movement correcting device drives a
correcting lens provided in a portion of the photographing lens system to
cancel the vibrations thereby to correct movement of an image based on the
output of the vibration sensor while the shutter is opened.Figs. 7 and 8 are block diagrams showing structures of conventional
image correcting cameras capable of correcting movement of an image as
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 3-37616 and 3-46642
respectively.The camera in Fig. 7 is provided with angular rate detectors 23, 24, a
correction drive amount calculating device 25 and a correction drive device
26. The angular rate detectors 23, 24 detect angular
rates (movements) around X- and Y-axes which are at
right angles to the optical axis of the camera.Based on the displacements (rotation angles)
around the X- and Y-axis directions calculated from
respective outputs of the angular rate detectors 23,
24, the correction drive amount calculating device 25
calculates an amount of drive of a correcting lens (not
shown) so as to cancel the movement of the image.The correction drive device 26 correct the
movement of the image occurring in the camera by
driving the correcting lens in accordance with the
calculated amount of drive.The camera in Fig. 8 is provided with acceleration
detectors 27, 28, angular rate detectors 29, 30, an
object distance measuring device 31, correction drive
amount calculating device 32 and a correction drive
device 33.The acceleration detectors 27, 28 detect
accelerations in X- and Y-axis directions respectively.The angular rate detectors 29, 30 detect angular
rates around X- and Y-axes respectively.The object distance measuring device 31 measures
the distance between an object and the camera.Based on a displacement (an amount of movement) in
the Y-axis direction calculated from the output of the
acceleration detector 28, a displacement (a rotation 
angle) around the X-axis calculated from the output of
the angular rate detector 29, and the output of the
object distance measuring device
