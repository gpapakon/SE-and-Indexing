<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to signalling systems
suitable for use in railways.As the demands on public transport become greater, there
is a need to increase the capacity of railways. One
solution to this is to use shorter "headways" (headway is
the time between the passage of one train and the next)
to improve the performance of existing railways. This
can be achieved by using "moving block" signalling, and
according to the present invention moving block
signalling can be "overlaid" on to an existing "fixed
block" signalling system with resultant improvements in
the capacity of the railway together with savings in
equipment costs due to not having to replace any of the
existing signalling equipment.In a conventional "fixed block" system, trains travel on
railways that are notionally divided into fixed "blocks".
Each block comprises a section of railway track. These
are normally defined physically by train detection
apparatus such as track circuits, axle counters, position
detectors and the like. "Routes", which may be followed
by a train and which define the movements that a train
may make through a system, include one or more adjacent
blocks. Routes are defined for the convenience of
operating a train service.Figure 1 illustrates blocks and routes. Referring to
Figure 1, a railway track 1 is divided into block
sections 2. Routes 3, 4 and 5 may be defined by one or
more block sections. The directions of routes over
junctions are different depending on the lay of the
points at the junction. The lay of the points, and hence
the directions of the routes, are conventionally referred
to as "normal" and "reverse", although at any junction
these terms are allocated purely for convenience. There
are four routes by which a train can pass over any 
junction, as shown in Figures 2a) and 2b). Referring to
these Figures, points 6 are shown in a "normal" position
and routes A and B may then be taken across the junction;
points 7 are shown in a "reverse" position and routes C
and D may then be taken across the junction.A route is said to have a "start" or ("entry") location
and a "finish" (or "destination") location and the path
between the two is defined by the lay of any points in
between. Routes' start and finish locations are
generally located at signals on the railway. Figure 3
shows three routes: E, F and G, between locations 8 and
9 spaced apart on a railway track. There are signals at
locations 8 and 9. Although they traverse the same path
between 8 and 9, routes E and F are distinct because they
have

<CLAIMS>
A railway signalling system using moving block
signalling and comprising:


control means (13,66-68,87) for controlling the
movements of railway vehicles (10,11,12,28,75) on a

railway track divided into block sections (77-81), the control means
including storage means (21) for storing

data defining physical characteristics of the railway
track and the locations of said vehicles, first

processing means (22) for processing the data stored in
the storage means to determine for each of said vehicles

a limit of movement authority (LMA), which defines a
point along the track beyond which the vehicle is not

authorised to proceed, and first communication means
(66,67) for transmitting to each of said vehicles

movement data defining the limit of movement authority of
the vehicle; and
protection means (29-44, 53-60) carried by each of
said vehicles (10,11,12,28,75)

for causing the vehicle to move under
the control of the control means (13,66-68,87), comprising

second communication means (53-60) for sending information giving
the location of the vehicle to the control means (13,66-68,87)

and for receiving said
movement data relating to the vehicle, second storage

means (41) storing geographical data defining physical
characteristics of the railway track, second processing

means (32-39) for processing the movement data in
dependence on the geographical data to determine a

maximum safe operating speed for the vehicle and
operation means (31) for controlling the vehicle to

travel at no more than the determined maximum safe
operating speed, the system being characterised in that:

said system is adapted so that it is also
suitable for operating further vehicles (76) which

do not carry such protection means (29-44, 53-60), the
system including an interlocking (88) for controlling line-side signals

and means (82-86) for detecting the occupancy of a block section
(77-81) by a

vehicle (75, 76) and for sending the
corresponding information via the interlocking (88) to said

control means (13,68,87),

means (13,66-68,87) being adapted:

(i) to determine that if a section of track is occupied
by a vehicle but there is no corresponding vehicle

location information from such protection means (29-44,
53-60), then the vehicle is such a further vehicle (76)

which does not carry such protection means; and
(ii) to determine that, in the event that such a first-mentioned
vehicle (75) carrying such protection means (29-44, 53-60)
