<ABSTRACT>
A high-performance organic waste water treating system 
allows continuous processing of waste water without causing 

deterioration of performance due to clogging of a filtration 
bed, excessive sludge, bad smell, or breeding of flies. The 

apparatus invention includes a trickling filtration bed tank 
(1) packed with filter media (4) having a particle diameter 

of not greater than 10 mm, the filtration bed (4) comprising 
an upper portion, a middle portion, and a lower 
portion, an 
air supply unit (7) for feeding air from a bottom of the 

filtration bed to make the air flow through the filtration 
bed (4), and a vent pipe (8) embedded in the middle portion 

of the filtration bed and opening to the atmosphere. In 
use, a predetermined amount of organic waste water is 

abruptly supplied via an inlet (5) over a short time period 
into the filtration bed (4), and repetition of such abrupt 

supply of organic waste water allows organic waste water to 
be processed efficiently without causing secondary products 

such as a microbial membrane or sludge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel technique of 
processing and purifying industrial and municipal organic 
waste water by utilizing digestive and degradable actions of 
microorganisms. The organic waste water processed herein 
generally has the water content of not less than 98%. When 
organic substances included in the waste water have high 
solubility like sugar, however, the water content may be 
approximately 95%. Known methods of biologically processing organic waste 
water include aerobic processes such as an activated sludge 
process, a biological membrane process, and a stabilization 
pond process and anaerobic processes such as a digestive 
process. The biological membrane process brings a biological filter 
membrane formed on the surface of a solid base in contact 
with organic waste water to process sludge in the waste 
water. A typical example of the biological membrane process 
is a trickling filtration system. Continuous supply of oxygen is required to enhance the 
actions of aerobic microorganisms and thereby to maintain the 
sufficient processing ability of a trickling filtration bed. 
Insufficient supply of oxygen makes anaerobic microorganisms 
dominant in the filtration bed to significantly deteriorate 
the processing ability of the filtration bed. Examples of typical filter media used for the trickling  
 
filtration bed include crushed igneous rocks such as andesite 
or granite, coal, cokes, and mineral residues. The filter 
medium should have a rough surface for preventing unintentional 
peel-off of the biological membrane and a particle 
diameter of not less than 30 mm for preventing clogging or 
interference in smooth air feeding. In the conventional trickling filtration system, the 
process loading (BOD loading) is 0.7 to 2.1 Kg/m² day, 
and the rate of BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) removal is 60 
to 80% with a final settling tank and at most 50% without 
a final settling tank. The conventional filtration trickling system causes bad 
smell and breeding of flies in the filtration bed, and moreover 
can not effectively process or purify organic waste 
water having the BOD concentration three or more times the 
final BOD concentration required for processed water. The 
activated sludge process has better processing performance 
but has other disadvantages such as high processing cost or 
excessive sludge. The object of the present invention is thus to provide a 
high-performance organic waste water treating system which 
allows continuous processing of waste water without
