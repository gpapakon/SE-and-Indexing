<ABSTRACT>
An automatic multi-spindle lathe for machining material bars. The lathe includes a rotatable and translatable turret (2) joined to a set of spindles (3) for supporting the bars (M), and members for shaping the bars (M) including tool carriages (14) shaped to house the machining tools (12) and guided by supported and rotated control cams (16, 18). Said lathe is characterised in that the shaping members are arranged around a central body (50) for inwardly guiding the turret (2) whereas the shaping assembly and the spindles (3) incorporated into the turret (2) are actuated from outside by a peripheral drive assembly.

Multi-spindle automatic lathe, intended for 
machining bars of material, comprising : 


a support structure, 
a spindle carrier (2) having a central bore (66) 
and adapted to be displaced in rotation and translation 

with respect to said support structure, and on which 
spindles (3) intended for holding bars (M) are assembled 

together, and 
means for shaping bars (M) fixedly attached to 
said support structure and including tool bearing 

carriages (14) conformed so as to receive machining tools 
(12) and which are directed by control cams (16, 18) 

supported and driven in rotation,
 
characterized in that said support structure is formed of 

a central body (50) on which a guiding shaft (54) is fixed 
which extends longitudinally along said body (50), said 

shaping means being mounted on said central body (50), at 
its periphery, whereas said guiding shaft (54) engages 

with said central base (66), this shaft (54) and the base 
(66) ensuring by themselves the interior guidance of the 

spindle carrier (2), this spindle carrier (2) being 
rotationally displaceable around said guiding shaft (54), 

as well as being translationally displaceable towards said 
shaping means, while these shaping means and the spindles 

(3) integrated with the spindle carrier (2) are actuated 
from the exterior by peripheral driving means (8, 24). 
Lathe according to claim 1, characterized in that 
it includes modular machining units (4) forming said means 

for shaping bars (M), each of such units (4) including, in 
an integrated manner, a tool bearing carriage (14) as well 

as one or several cams (16, 18) intended for the 
displacement of said carriage (14). 
Lathe according to claim 2, characterized in that 
each modular machining unit (4) includes, in an integrated 

manner, its own cam shaft (20) which is supported for  
 

rotation on a frame (28) mounted on the exterior of the 
central body (50). 
Lathe according to claim 3, characterized in that 
each modular machining unit (4) further includes a driving 

wheel (22) mechanically anchored to the cam shaft (20). 
Lathe according to claim 4, characterized in that 
the driving wheels (22) of the modular machining units (4) 

are driven in concomitant manner by an exterior notched 
belt (24) surrounding the central body (50). 
Lathe according to claim 3, characterized in that 
each rigid frame includes a frontal plate (32) extending 

radially from the central body (50), each plate (32) 
supporting in a rigid manner one end of the cam shaft (20) 

as well as a guide pipe (42). 
Lathe according to claim 6, characterized in that 
each modular machining unit (4) includes two cams (16, 

18), both supported on a common shaft (20) and directing 
the same tool bearing carriage (14). 
Lathe according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the modular machining units (4) are mounted around the 

central body (50) according to a fan-shaped arrangement. 
Lathe according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the peripheral driving means which actuate the spindles 

(3) from the exterior are formed by a notched belt (8) 
surrounding the spindles (3). 
Lathe according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the central body (50) 

provided with the modular machining units (4) is fixedly 
supported within a non-rigid frame (S), while the spindle 

carrier (2) is supported by means of a guide bar (GB) 
fixedly mounted behind the latter.
