<ABSTRACT>
A machine for roughening the bottom of a shoe along its peripheral 
edge comprises a shoe support (20) and a working head (17) with a disc-shaped 

roughening tool (29) which rotates in one plane and has a 
peripheral rim for working the bottom of the shoe. The shoe support (20) 

and the working head (17) are movable relative to one another so as to 
cause the tool (29) to follow a predetermined trajectory along said edge. 

The tool is supported by orienting means (27) so as to be arranged with 
the plane of rotation perpendicular to or inclined at a predetermined 

angle with respect to the lateral profile of the bottom during the 
movement along said trajectory.

<DESCRIPTION>
In shoe manufacturing technology automatic machines are known in which 
the shoe bottoms are scraped along their perimeter after the upper has 
been applied in order to eliminate the shoulder formed as a result of 
folding over of the hems of the upper onto the bottom and in order to 
roughen the upper and the bottom, with the aim of improving gripping 
during the subsequent sole-gluing operation. These machines generally consist of one or two rotating circular tools 
with an abrasive peripheral edge. The tools are guided so as to travel 
along the lateral edge of the bottom in order to perform the required 
roughening operation. Generally the relative movement of tool and shoe occurs along 
orthogonal Cartesian axes. The tool therefore always moves parallel to 
itself in a plane which is usually transverse with respect to the 
direction in which the bottom of the shoe extends. In view of the winding 
pattern of the profile of the shoe bottom, the plane of rotation of the 
tool therefore forms an extremely variable angle with said profile 
during its movement. It has been found that such an action of the tool on the edge of the 
upper causes stressing and distortion of the part of the edge glued to the 
bottom of the shoe, thus impairing both the final appearance of the upper 
and the subsequent operation involving fixing of the sole. The general aim of the present invention is to overcome the 
abovementioned drawbacks, providing an automatic machine for scraping and 
roughening shoe bottoms, which does not give rise to abnormal stressing or  
 
distortion of the edge of an upper being worked on. In order to achieve this aim, according to the present invention, it 
has been thought to provide a machine for roughening the bottom of a shoe 
along its peripheral edge, comprising a shoe support and a working head 
with a disc-shaped roughening tool which rotates in one plane and has a 
peripheral rim for working the bottom of the shoe, the shoe support and 
the working head being movable relative to one another so as to cause the 
tool to follow a predetermined trajectory along said edge, characterized 
in that the tool is supported by orienting means so as to be arranged with 
the plane of rotation inclined at a predetermined angle with respect to 
the lateral profile of the bottom during the movement of the tool along 
said trajectory. In order to explain more clearly the innovative principles of the 
present invention and its advantages with respect to the known art, a 
description is provided below,

Machine for roughening the bottom of a shoe along its peripheral 
edge, comprising a shoe support (20) and a working head (17) with a disc-shaped 

roughening tool (29) which rotates in one plane and has a 
peripheral rim for working the bottom of the shoe, the shoe support (20) 

and the working head (17) being movable relative to one another so as 
to cause the tool (29) to follow a predetermined trajectory along said 

edge, characterized in that the tool is supported by orienting means 
designed to keep the plane of rotation inclined at a predetermined angle 

with respect to the lateral profile of the bottom during the movement of 
the tool along said trajectory. 
Machine according to Claim 1, in which said predetermined angle 
between the plane of rotation of the tool and the lateral profile of the 

bottom is substantially equivalent to 90°. 
Machine according to Claim 1, in which said predetermined angle 
between the plane of rotation of the tool and the lateral profile of the 

bottom, viewed in a horizontal plane, is substantially equivalent to 90° 
in the region of the central, toe and heel zone of the bottom and is less 

than 90° in the front and rear end zones connecting the aforementioned 
zones. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in that said 
orienting means comprise a support (28) driven by an adjustable-position 

motor unit (27) and fixed to the head (17) rotatably about a first axis 
(32) substantially perpendicular to the surface of the bottom of the shoe. 
Machine according to Claim 4, characterized in that said first 
 

axis (32) passes substantially through the point of contact of the tool 
(29) with the bottom of the shoe. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in that the tool (29) 
is supported with its own plane of rotation rotatable about a second axis 

(34) perpendicular to the first axis (32) and substantially tangential 
with the tool in the region of the point of contact of the tool with the 

bottom of the shoe. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in that the tool (29) 
is movable in its plane of rotation against the action of resilient means 

(40) pushing with a controlled force the tool against the bottom of the 
shoe. 
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in that it comprises 
a carriage (20) supporting the shoe support, which is movable along guides 

(18, 19) in a first horizontal direction substantially coinciding with the 
longitudinal direction of the bottom of the supported shoe, and slides 

(13, 16) supporting the working head (17), which are movable along 
respective guides (11, 12 and 14, 15) in a vertical direction and in a 

second horizontal direction perpendicular to said first horizontal 
direction, so as to achieve relative translatory movements of the tool 

(29) and support (20) along three Cartesian axes. 
Machine according to Claim 6, characterized in that the tool (29) 
is supported at the end of an arm (30), the other end of which is hinged 

on articulated means (36) in turn hinged with the support (28) of the 
working head (17) so as to allow rotation of the tool in its own plane of 

rotation against the action of resilient means (40), about a third axis 
(31) perpendicular to said first axis (32) and second axis (34). 
Machine according to Claims 6 and 9, in which said rotation about 
the second axis (34) is effected by a linear actuator (45) fixed at one 

end to an extension of the support (28) of the working head and at the 
other end to said articulated means (36).
