<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a support casing (10) for securing the turbo-charger (102, 1, 2, 1', 2') of an internal combustion engine. The support casing (10) surrounds a chamber designed to accept the turbines (107, 4, 4', 6, 6') of the turbo-charger (102, 1, 2, 1', 2') while the compressors are outside the chamber. To simplify and reduce the cost of production and assembly, the bearing housings (108, 16, 17, 16', 17') of the turbo-charger (102, 1, 2, 1', 2') are integrated into the support casing (10). Simpler and more economical production and assembly can also be attained if the support casing (10) is divided into two symmetrical sections (11, 11') along a plane passing through the height axis in the centre of the support casing (10). The two casing sections (11, 11') are preferably centrically symmetrical in relation to the central height axis.

<CLAIMS>
A support housing (10) to be mounted on an internal-combustion 
engine for at least two exhaust-driven chargers 

(102), wherein the exhaust-driven chargers (102) are each 
formed with two rotors mounted on a common shaft (105), one 

of which is disposed in a compressor housing and the other 
of which is disposed in a turbine housing, wherein the 

common shaft (105) is mounted respectively in a bearing 
housing (108) disposed between the compressor housing and 

turbine housing, the turbine housings of the exhaust-driven 
chargers forming flow chambers each of which comprises a 

spiral duct, adjoining a radially inner rotor duct, and an 
axially directed outlet duct, wherein the support housing 

(10) is in the form of a box-type support device containing 
a cavity for the exhaust-driven chargers (102), to which the 

exhaust-driven chargers (102) are secured, the compressor 
housing being disposed outside the cavity and the turbine 

housing being disposed inside the cavity, wherein recesses 
for the passage of the shafts (105) of the exhaust-driven 

chargers (102) are provided in the walls of the support 
housing (10) and openings for the inlet and outlet of 

exhaust gases to and from the turbine housings, 
characterised in that the bearing housing (108) of the 

exhaust-driven chargers (102) are integrated in the walls of 
the support housing (10). 
A support housing according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that in the case of a support housing (10) composed of a 

plurality of housing parts (11,11'), the dividing joint (9) 
between the housing parts (11,11') extends out of the wall 

regions in which the recesses for accommodating the exhaust-driven 
chargers (102) are provided.  

 
A support housing according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the support housing (10) is divided in 

at least one plane extending parallel to a vertical axis of 
the support housing (10), the vertical axis extending in a 

direction normal to the surface of each plane in which the 
longitudinal axes of the exhaust-driven chargers (1,2,1',2') 

are clamped, and in that the exhaust-driven chargers 
(1,2,1',2') are mounted on lateral walls of the support 

housing (10), which extend parallel to the vertical axis. 
A support housing according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that in relation to a plane extending parallel to the 

vertical axis the support housing (10) is divided into two 
substantially symmetrical housing parts (11,11'). 
A support housing according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that in relation to an axis of symmetry of the support 

housing (10) parallel to the vertical axis, the support 
housing (10) is formed by two centrally symmetrical housing 

parts (11,11'), on which the exhaust-driven chargers 
(1,2,1',2') are arranged centrally symmetrically in relation 

to the axis of symmetry. 
A support housing according to any one of Claims 2 to 
5, characterised in that exhaust-driven chargers (1,2 and 

1',2') for two-stage supercharging are respectively assigned 
to each of the housing parts (11,11'), and in that, viewed 

in the direction of the vertical axis, the longitudinal axes 
of each of the exhaust-driven chargers (1,2 and 1',2') are 

disposed at an acute angle to one another.
