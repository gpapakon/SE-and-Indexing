<ABSTRACT>
A method of making an electrical connection of a conductor (1) to a thick film track (2) mounted on a substrate (3) includes the steps of heating the conductor (1) to a temperature at which it may melt the glass constituent of the track (2), and inserting it into the track (2) such that it sinks in and contacts the metallic constituent of the track. The glass sets, fixing the conductor in place. Thus the need for a second firing operation is avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the making of electrical 
connections to thick film tracks and starts from US-A-4' 719' 317. Thick film heaters comprise a track of electrically 
resistive material provided on a substrate. The track is 
formed by depositing an electrically conductive ink on the 
substrate, which ink comprises a finely divided metal mixed 
with a glass frit. After the ink has been deposited on the 
substrate, it undergoes a firing or furnacing operation 
which causes the glass frit to melt and produce a continuous 
glass layer with metal particles dispersed therein. The 
metal particles contact each other, and also are sintered 
together to some degree by the furnacing operation, such 
that they form a conductive pathway through the track. Known methods of connecting an electrically conductive 
element to a thick film track, for example in order to 
connect it to a power supply, have involved expensive 
equipment or lengthy procedures. For example, soldering the 
conductor onto the track involves the printing and furnacing 
of an additional ink layer (as disclosed in US 4719317). 
Conductive epoxy adhesives can be used, but they are 
expensive, and are only suitable for use at temperatures 
below about 135Â°C. Wire bonding or gold ball bonding 
requires the use of expensive equipment. It is an object of the present invention to alleviate 
the above problems. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a method of connecting an electrically conductive element to 
a thick film track of electrically resistive material 
provided on a substrate, the material having a metal 
constituent and a glass constituent, characterized in the 
the method comprises the steps of: heating the element to 
a temperature above the melting point of the glass 
constituent of the track, inserting the element into the 
track and allowing the element to cool. As the thermal mass of the conductive element is small 
relative to that of the track it can be arranged that only 
a portion of the track immediately surrounding the element 
melts, and hence the other parts of the track and substrate  
 
are not damaged. Furthermore, the glass in the track may set 
rapidly to fix the element into the track. This method is quick and simple, and can easily be performed 
without the need for a special environment or equipment. For 
example, the conductive element may be heated by a flame. 
Consequently it can be a relatively inexpensive method. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way 
of example, with
