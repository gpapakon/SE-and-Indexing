<DESCRIPTION>
A composite of one or more metallo organo moieties as part of a
liquid crystal phase that is uniformly and discretely dispersed in a
polymer matrix, processes for making the composite, and liquid crystal
devices containing the liquid crystal mixture, and the composite.The nature of liquid crystal materials may be summarized as follows.
The three common states of matter are the solid, liquid, and gas states in
which the randomness of geometrical arrangement of the molecules
increases from the solid to the liquid to the gas. The gas and the
ordinary liquid are both isotropic, having the same physical properties in
all directions. Most solids are found to be crystalline; that is, their
molecular units are arranged in a regular repeating geometrical pattern
of lattice units and consequently are frequently anisotropic in that their
physical properties vary depending upon the direction of measurement
with respect to different crystal axes. Certain organic solid compounds
exhibit a peculiar behavior such that upon melting a turbid melt results
that changes abruptly to clear isotropic liquid upon heating to a higher
temperature. In this temperature range, these compounds are
anisotropic with respect to all physical properties, as well as
transmission of light. Thus, the characteristics of these compounds are
partly those of the isotropic liquid since they exhibit liquid flow and
partly those of the anisotropic solid. Therefore, these materials are often
called "liquid crystals" or, more accurately, "crystalline liquids" and are
sometimes classified as a fourth state of matter referred to as the
mesomorphic state or mesophase, being a state or phase intermediate
that of the anisotropic crystal and that of the isotropic liquid. All liquid
crystals have two indices of refraction: an extraordinary index of
refraction ne measured along the long axis of the liquid crystals, and a
smaller ordinary index of refraction no measured in a plane
perpendicular to the long axis. The long axis of the liquid crystal defines 
its optic axis. There are essentially two major classes of liquid crystals,
the "nematic" state and the "smectic" state. The nematic liquid crystal
materials generally consist of rod-shaped molecules that tend to align
parallel to a common direction resulting in anisotropy for many of the
bulk properties.When the liquid crystal alignment is "homeotropic"
(perpendicular to, e.g., a supporting glass surface), a sample of the liquid
crystal is optically clear (pseudo-isotropic). However, when a critical
