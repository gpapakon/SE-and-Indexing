<ABSTRACT>
A method of attaching a semiconductor die (10) to a 
substrate (26) includes forming a metallic bump (17) on 

the semiconductor die (10) to extend a distance (20) 
from the semiconductor die (10). A conductive epoxy bump 

(18) is then formed on the metallic bump (17). The 
conductive epoxy bump (18) is placed in contact with the 

substrate (26). The conductive epoxy bump (18) is 
rapidly cured to maintain precise alignment between the 

semiconductor die (10) and the substrate (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to 
methods for attaching a semiconductor die to an 
intermediate substrate, and more particularly, to a novel 
flip-chip method of attaching a semiconductor die to an 
intermediate substrate. A variety of so called flip-chip bonding or 
attachment techniques have been used to attach a 
semiconductor die to intermediate substrates such as 
printed circuit boards. Two of these prior art flip-chip 
techniques are commonly known as solder ball and epoxy 
bump attach. One problem associated with these prior art 
flip-chip techniques is the inability to maintain precise 
alignment, less than a 2 micron variation, between 
elements on the semiconductor die and elements on the 
intermediate substrate. Such precise alignment is 
particularly important in attaching an optical 
semiconductor device to an intermediate substrate having 
corresponding optical elements. Precise alignment 
typically requires die to substrate planarity, that is, 
the variation from parallel alignment, of less than 
approximately 0.1 percent. Solder ball attachment techniques utilize a ball of 
solder between a semiconductor die and the intermediate 
substrate. Attachment is accomplished by melting or 
liquefying the solder ball then cooling the solder ball 
to facilitate adhesion to both the semiconductor die and 
the substrate. The liquid solder ball's surface tension 
generally moves the die thereby destroying precise  
 
alignment made between elements on the semiconductor die 
and elements on the intermediate substrate as the die was 
placed on the substrate. Epoxy bump attachment techniques result in bumps 
having unequal heights. One example of such an epoxy 
bump attachment method is described in U.S. Patent No. 
5,074,947 issued to Estes et al on December 24, 1991. In 
order to achieve the desired planarity of less than 
approximately 0.1 percent , height variation among the 
epoxy bumps must be less than approximately 2 to 3 
microns. Because the height variation typically is 
greater than 3 microns, die to substrate planarity varies 
more than 0.1 percent thereby preventing precise 
alignment between semiconductor die elements and 
substrate elements. An additional problem with the prior 
epoxy bumps is the minimum bump spacing that can be 
achieved is only approximately 250 microns. It is 
desirable to have bump spacings of less than 250 microns. Solder ball attachment techniques also result in 
bumps of unequal height. The height of each solder ball 
is determined by the amount of
