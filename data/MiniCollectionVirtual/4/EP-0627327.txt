<ABSTRACT>
Offset printing process in which the printing quality is enhanced when it is carried out in the presence of ionic organic microparticles which can swell in water and are water-insoluble, and which are dispersed in the wetting water, or in the ink or the varnish, or in the wetting water and in the ink or the varnish, the use of these microparticles avoiding the use of isopropyl alcohol which is conventionally introduced into the wetting water, and aqueous composition for this purpose.

<CLAIMS>
A method for offset printing characterised in that it is performed in the presence, 
either in the wetting water or in the ink or lacquer used, or in the wetting water and in the 

ink or lacquer used, of a copolymer P, which is ionic, hydrophilic, cross-linked and insoluble 
in but capable of swelling in water, in the form of water-swollen microparticles of diameter 

less than approximately 1 Âµm, based on acrylamide, a copolymerisable diethylenic cross-linking 
agent and 
one or more anionic monomers of formula (I) 

 
in which R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl radical and M represents an atom of 

hydrogen, sodium or potassium or an ammonium group, or one or more cationic monomers 
of formula (II): 


 
in which R has the meaning given above, Z represents an oxygen atom or an NH group, R
1
 
represents a methyl or ethyl radical, R
2
 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl, ethyl or 
benzyl radical, X represents a chlorine atom or an OSO
3
R
2
 group in which R
2
 has the 
meaning given above and n represents 2 or 3. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that copolymer P is an anionic 
copolymer based on acrylamide and acrylic acid partly converted into a salt with ammonia 

and cross-linked with a diethylene monomer selected from the group comprising methylene 
bisacrylamide and bisacrylamidoacetic acid. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that copolymer P is a cationic 
copolymer based on acrylamide and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl acrylate converted into a salt 

with hydrochloric acid or quaternised with methyl chloride and cross-linked with a diethylene 
monomer selected from the group comprising methylenebisacrylamide and 

bisacrylamidoacetic acid.  
 
A method according to claim 2, characterised in that the anionic copolymer is a 
copolymer based on acrylamide, acrylic acid, ammonium acrylate and bisacrylamidoacetic 

acid, 29.6 - 65.1 - 5.1 - 0.2 in molar proportions. 
A method according to claim 3, characterised in that the cationic copolymer is an 
acrylamide-based copolymer of acryloyloxy-2-ethyltrimethylammonium chloride and 

bisacrylamidoacetic acid 79.15 - 20.83 - 0.02 in molar proportions. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that copolymer P is dispersed in the 
state of water-swollen microparticles in a self-reversible water-in-oil dispersion. 
An aqueous composition which can be used in an offset printing process in either the 
wetting water or the ink or lacquer or even in both the wetting water and the ink or lacquer, 

characterised in that it contains a copolymer (P) as defined in claim 1 in the form of water-swollen 
microparticles.
