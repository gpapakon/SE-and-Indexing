<ABSTRACT>
The system comprises a weight (1) which is gradually 
displaceable along a rocking guide (10) which oscillates 

when the user performs an exercise by pulling the 
same weight (1) during the exercise for each determined 

position of the weight (1) along the rocking guide (10). 
The displacement of the weight (1) along the rocking 

guide (10) increases or reduces gradually the weight for 
the exercise of the user, through a combination of a resistance 

arm consisting of the weight (1) displaceable along 
the rocking guide (10) and of two power (4) and resistance 

(5) wheels associated to each other through a transmission 
means (7), the power wheel (4) being connected to the user-actuated 

means (13, 14) and the resistance wheel (5) being 
connected to the shaft (3) of the rocking guide (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an automatic weight adjustment 
system for gymnasium exercise apparatus. At present, for body-building, gymnasium, etc, machines, 
the market offers electronic machines which work using 
compressed air via cylinders and iron plates which make 
up a block comprised of plates of 5 or 10 kg. and with a 
weight per block which varies between 25 and 200 kg., 
depending on the machine and the exercise being 
performed. Both the electronic and compressed-air machines have the 
drawback of exercising an uneven force, thus presenting 
difficulties when exercising, especially for 
professionals and physical instructors. At present, in 
gymnasia and professional centres, machines with iron 
plates making a block are used mainly, this system being 
the most commonly used due to the fact that the force 
exercised is the most true and balanced, although it 
poses a major problem when weight needs to be increased 
or decreased, as the exercises have to be interrupted at 
this point to place the weight selector on the spot on 
the block required and the exercises resumed with more or 
less weight, which interferes with the exercises 
enormously, both because of the stoppage and because of 
the abrupt weight change. Amongst the exercise apparatus using iron plates making 
a block, we can cite the Lambert Jr. et al US-A-4 322 071 
patent, which is of the classic type. There are other patents which use a weight which can be 
displaced along a tilting guide which is tipped by the 
user, amongst which we can cite the W.G. Annas US-A- 3  
 
573 865 patent, in which the tilting guide with the 
weight tips freely on the axis on one side, and is tilted 
by a framework connected firmly to the transmission 
system. Telle's US-A- 4 863 161 patent, in which the 
motor does not engage the spindle directly and 
lengthways. Moreover, it works in combination with a 
hydraulic cylinder. Cartwright's US-AS- 4 650 185 patent 
in which the motor does not engage the spindle directly 
and lengthways, and Jungreis' US-A-3 731 922 patent. In all the above patents, the arrangement and 
displacement of the weight on the tilting guide is 
different, and transmission of the user's action is 
completely different from this invention. Likewise, the 
aforesaid Annas, Telle, Cartwright and Jungreis patents 
do not make use of the two power and resistance wheels of 
this invention, neither is the power wheel (or its 
equivalents) connected to the means activated by the 
user, nor is the resistance wheel connected to the swivel

<CLAIMS>
Automatic weight adjustment system for gymnasium 
exercise apparatus comprising a tilting guide (10) along 

which a weight (1) is displaced and positioned, by way of 
a spindle (9) driven by motorized means (8), the tilting 

guide (10) of which is tipped by the user's action, 
the tipping movement being 

effected by way of a power wheel (4) driven by the user 
(13,14) and a resistance wheel (5), characterized by the fact that 

the axis of the resistance wheel (5) is provided in the rotating axis 
(3,6) of the tilting guide (10), said power wheel (4) and resistance 

wheel (5) being connected by a chain transmission (7) rolled up, in an 

eccentric way, on the power wheel (4), such that at each 
position of the weight (1) in the tilting guide (10), the 

user performs the same weight pulling during the 
exercise.
