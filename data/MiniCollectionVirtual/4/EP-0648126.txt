<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides pharmaceutical preparations for inhibiting in vitro and in vivo cancerous prostate, gastrointestinal and breast tumours. In one embodiment the pharmaceutical preparation includes prostatic inhibin peptide which may be administered in an appropriate dosage form, dosage quantity and dosage regimen to a patient suffering from prostate cancer. In another embodiment the pharmaceutical preparation includes a mixture of prostatic inhibin peptide and a cancer drug which may be administered in an appropriate dosage form, dosage quantity and dosage regimen to a patient suffering from, for example gastrointestinal cancer. The cancer drug of the latter mixture may be one selected from the group of drugs including mitomycin, idalubicin, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, adriamycin and donomycin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical
preparations for use as tumour suppressive agents for
tumours arising from prostatic adenocarcinoma, stomach
cancer, breast cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.The prostate gland, which is found exclusively in
male mammals, produces several components of semen and
blood and several regulatory peptides. The prostate gland
comprises stroma and epithelium cells, the latter group
consisting of columnar secretory cells and basal
nonsecretory cells. A proliferation of these basal cells
as well as stroma cells gives rise to benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH) which is one common prostate disease.
Another common prostate disease is prostatic adenocarcinoma
(CaP) which is the most common of the fatal
pathophysiological prostate cancers and involves a
malignant transformation of epithelial cells in the
peripheral region of the prostate gland. Prostatic
adenocarcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia are two
common prostate diseases which have a high rate of
incidence in the aging human male population.
Approximately one out of every four males above the age of
55 suffers from a prostate disease of some form or another.
Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer
related death in elderly men with there being approximately
96,000 cases diagnosed and about 26,000 deaths reported
annually in the United States.Studies of the various substances synthesized and
secreted by normal, benign and cancerous prostates carried
out in order to gain an understanding of the pathogenesis
of the various prostate diseases reveal that certain of 
these substances may be used as immunohistochemical tumour
markers in the diagnosis of prostate disease. The three
predominant proteins or peptides secreted by a normal
prostate gland are Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP),
Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and Prostatic Inhibin
Peptide (PIP) also known as Human Seminal Plasma Inhibin
(HSPI) and hereinafter referred to as HSPI.Metabolic and immunohistochemical studies have
shown that the prostate is a major source of HSPI. HSPI is
involved in the feedback control of, and acts to suppress
secretion of, circulating follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH) both in-vitro and in-vivo in adult male rats. HSPI
acts both at the pituitary as well as at the prostate site
since both are provided with receptor sites for HSPI.Both PSA and PAP have been studied as tumour
markers in the detection of prostate disease but since both
exhibit elevated levels in prostates having benign
prostatic hyperplasia
