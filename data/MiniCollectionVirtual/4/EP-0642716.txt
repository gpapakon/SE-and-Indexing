<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit for deriving a signal dependent on the direction of change of the reception field intensity in a radio receiver controllable by a microcomputer, outside the microcomputer there is a comparator to which the signal representing the current field intensity and a signal generated by the microcomputer and representing the field intensity at a previous time can be taken. An output signal from the comparator can be taken to the microcomputer.

<CLAIMS>
Circuit arrangement for deriving a signal which
is dependent on the direction in which the received

field strength is changing, in a broadcast radio
receiver which can be controlled by a microcomputer,

characterized in that a comparator (16) is provided
outside the microcomputer (2), to which comparator (16)

a signal which represents the respective field strength
and a signal which is produced by the microcomputer (2)

and represents the field strength at an earlier point
in time can be supplied, and in that an output signal

from the comparator (16) can be supplied to the microcomputer
(2).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the signal which represents the

field strength at an earlier point in time, and the
output signal from the comparator (16), are transmitted

between the comparator (16) and the microcomputer (2)
via a serial peripheral interface (SPI) (19, 20).
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the signals

which represent the field strength have a resolution of
16 binary digits.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized by use for testing the

field strength of alternative transmitters, to which
the broadcast radio receiver (1) is switched for

checking purposes.
