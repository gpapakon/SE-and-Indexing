<ABSTRACT>
The partial replacement (1) for a spinal disc, to take up pressure, has a sleeve (2) rounded at the trailing end of an elastic material, and a metallic body (3) with a pin (4) fitted to a closing plate (5). The interior of the sleeve (2) gives a holding zone (6) for the pin (4). When the closing plate (5) is fitted to the sleeve (2), it lies at the end side of the sleeve (2), flush with it, to give the closing action. The sleeve (2) is of silicon.

<CLAIMS>
Partial intervertebral disc prosthesis (1) for introduction into an intervertebral 
disc as a relieving part, consisting of a distally rounded sleeve (2) made from 

resilient material and a metal body (3) having a pin (4) which is attached to a 
closure plate (5), wherein the interior of sleeve (2) has a receiving space (6) for 

pin (4) such that closure plate (5) rests essentially against the end-face side of 
sleeve (2) when pin (4) is placed in sleeve (2) and closes essentially flush with the 

latter. 
Partial intervertebral disc prosthesis according to claim 1, in which sleeve (2) 
consists of silicone. 
Partial intervertebral disc prosthesis according to claim 1 or 2, in which pin (4) 
is provided with a surface-enlarging profile (7). 
Partial intervertebral disc prosthesis according to one of claims 1 to 3, in which 
closure plate (5) has an annular collar (8), which encloses sleeve (2) provided with 

a recess (9) on the proximal end and externally has a three-dimensional open-meshed 
spatial reticular structure (10).
