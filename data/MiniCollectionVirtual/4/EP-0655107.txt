<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is medical infusion pumps.
More specifically, this invention is an infusion pump which
has programmable delivery profiles, and which can be
programmed to be used with a variety of intravenous ("IV")
infusion sets using various types of tubing with various
sizes and physical characteristics that impact delivery
profiles.A variety of infusion pumps and controllers exist in the
prior art. Commonly, an IV administration set is used with
a disposable reservoir bag and a flexible IV tube. The
tubing has within it a drip chamber to eliminate bubbles in
the fluid in the tubing. The distal end of the tubing has a
intravenous needle for insertion into the patient.
Traditionally the reservoir bag is raised above the patient
and drained by gravity into the patient.Infusion pumps and controllers were developed to attach
to the outside of the tubing to control the rate of flow from
the reservoir bag into the patient. The controllers would
constrict the tubing or unconstrict it over time to control
the flow by gravity to the patient. Infusion pumps use the
power of the pump to move the fluid to the patient and do not
use the elevation of the bag above the patient to determine
the pressure in the tubing.Some infusion pumps use a chamber of a known volume.
The rate of flow of the pump is controlled by controlling the
number of times in a period that the chamber is filled and
pumped out.Many infusion pumps are peristaltic pumps. Peristaltic
pumps in the prior art are of two types, finger peristaltic
pumps and rotary peristaltic pumps. Finger peristaltic pumps
have a row of fingers or depressors along a section of the
tubing. The fingers are depressed in a series or waves
creating a moving contraction along the tubing which pumps
the fluid through the tubing. Rotary peristaltic pumps have
a number of arms on a rotor. Each arm has a roller at the 
end of the arm. As the rotor rotates in a circular chamber,
the rollers on the end of the arms roll along and constrict
the tubing lining the outer surface of the chamber. This
creates a series of rolling contractions through the tubing
that pumps the fluid through the tubing.A primary limitation of the gravity infusion bag is that
the pressure (and therefore the flow rate) of the fluid is
determined by the height at which the bag is hung above the
patient. Furthermore, the prior art peristaltic pumps are
calibrated to deliver the requested flow rate for a specific
size and type of tubing. Therefore, a different prior art
peristaltic pump is required

different types of tube, said pump comprising:

a variable speed motor,
means to pump fluid (24) through an intravenous tube into a patient
that is driven by the variable speed motor,
input means for entering a desired fluid delivery profile and for
entering the type of the tube,

comprises twelve fingers depressed in a peristaltic series against an

intravenous tube to create peristaltic contractions in the tube, the fingers
being depressed by a rotating differential cam attached to the fingers, the

cam being rotated by the variable speed motor.
The infusion pump of any one of the preceding claims, further
comprising: 


means for sensing occlusion in the tube that can be re-calibrated for
different tube types, said means for sensing being in communication with

the calculating means and comprising a pressure sensor (25) for the tube
that is pressed against the tube.

input means for entering a desired fluid delivery profile and for entering the

type of the tube comprises a keyboard (9).
The infusion pump of any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
calculating means (1) comprises an integrated circuit chip with a memory

(1E) and a calculating function (1D), the memory containing data regarding
possible fluid delivery profiles and possible tube types to use for infusion.

profiles comprises: (1) a fixed rate of fluid flow, (2) a ramp up of steadily

increasing flow rate, (3) a ramp down of steadily decreasing flow rate, (4) a
fixed rate with increased rate spikes at specified intervals, and (5) no flow
