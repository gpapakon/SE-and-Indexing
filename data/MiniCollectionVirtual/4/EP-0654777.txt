<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for adjusting the brightness and contrast of a 
digital pulse-width modulated display without scaling the input image data. 

Brightness is adjusted by changing the duty cycle of a displayed pixel either by 
altering the bit display durations, or by turning the pixel on during blanking 

periods 
36
. The contrast ratio may be altered by changing the display duration 
of at least one of the MSBs differently than the display duration of at least one of 

the LSBs. Contrast may be increased by extending the MSB display periods 
50
 
and shortening the LSB display periods 
52
. Contrast may be decreased by 
shortening the MSB display periods 
56
 and extending the LSB display periods 

58
. The color tint of the displayed image may be altered by individually 
changing the brightness of the constituent colors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of visual display systems, more
particularly, to digital pulse-width modulated display systems.Display systems have long given viewers the capability to adjust display
characteristics in order to adapt to ambient conditions, adjust for poor quality
input signals, compensate for an aging display device, or to suit personal
preferences. Two of the primary means for adjustment have been the brightness
control and the contrast control.The brightness control theoretically adjusts the brightness or intensity of
the display by changing the amount of light emitted, reflected or transmitted by
the display. The contrast control adjusts the brightness ratio between light and
dark areas of the screen. Typically both the brightness and contrast
adjustments are implemented by changing either the gain or offset
characteristics, or both the gain and offset characteristics, of the image signal
path.Implementation of brightness and contrast controls in an all digital image
display system can be difficult. Typically this involves additional hardware such
as multipliers or lookup tables to scale the image data. Software can also be
used to scale the image data, but this requires additional processing capability.Methods and a system of adjusting the intensity of a pulse-width
modulated digital display pixel, wherein each pixel is represented by an
intensity word, and displayed sequentially for a duration dependent on the
weight of the bit according to the claims are disclosed. According to one embodiment of the disclosed
invention, the display duration of each bit of the intensity word is altered to
either increase the duty cycle of the pixel, resulting in increased pixel brightness,
or to decrease the duty cycle of the pixel, resulting in decreased pixel brightness
the increase or decrease being performed by changing at least one
of the at least one blanking periods to a bit set period.
To adjust the contrast ratio of a digital display, the duration of some bits is
increased while the duration of other bits is decreased. The disclosed methods
and system have the advantage of being inexpensive and easy to implement.In WO-A-92 12506 a method of gray-scale intensity adjustment
is disclosed, in which the duty cycle of the pixel display
time is altered by utilising an intensity word with a
plurality of bits.FIG. 1 is one example of timeline for typical 5-bit digital display using
pulse-width modulation.FIG. 2 is one example of a timeline for a typical 5-bit digital display
