<ABSTRACT>
A sterilization autoclave vacuum testing device which comprises 
a transparent gas impervious layer 1 adhered to an indicator 

layer. The indicator layer comprising a steam porous medium 
having imprinted there on a pattern utilizing a thermochromic 

ink composition. The indicator layer 2 is adhesively bonded to 
a porous barrier layer substrate 3 having a predetermined 

porosity, sufficient to prevent a complete and uniform colour 
change of the thermochromic ink at a vacuum of at least about 

711 mm of mercury (95 kPa) at a predetermined temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for testing the effectiveness 
of a vacuum in a steam sterilization autoclave. In 
particular it relates to a simplified device which does not 
require extensive hand labour to construct it. It is well known that heat will destroy microorganisms. The 
presence of moisture accelerates this destruction by denaturing 
or coagulation of the protein making up the microorganism. The 
importance of moist heat in the sterilization process has been 
known for about 100 years. While Pasteur had established the 
fact that temperatures above the boiling point of water were 
required to kill many organisms, it was not until 1880 that a 
steam pressure sterilizer was developed. However, there was no 
significant notice of the need for sterilization of hospital 
equipment and fabrics until the introduction of first 
antiseptic and then aseptic surgery. About the turn of the century manually controlled sterilizing 
autoclaves were introduce into hospitals. Their efficiency 
left much to be desired, but nonetheless, this was a definite 
step forward. As a result of advances in the food industry a 
fuller understanding of parameters required for spore kill was 
developed, and it was determined that the order of death was 
logarithmic. The most significant aspect in the development of safe and 
effect sterilization techniques was the recognition of the 
presence of moisture in the killing of microorganisms. Most 
microorganisms contain sufficient moisture so that moderate 
heat alone, eg 80°-100°C, will destroy the microorganism. Most 
bacterial spores, however, contain substantially no moisture. 
Their destruction by dry heat alone requires elevated 
temperatures in excess of 150°C. Such excessive temperatures 
can result in the destruction of the article to be sterilized, 
or otherwise seriously limit its useful life. Hence, in the  
 
hospital arena pathogenic spores are destroyed using a steam 
atmosphere in autoclaves. While the first effective steam sterilizers were conventionally 
operated at about 250°F (120°C) for sterilization cycles of 
about 12 to 15 minutes, the preferred sterilization conditions 
are about 270°F (130°C) for about 3 minutes. Since steam is essential to the effective operation of the 
sterilization process it is important to ensure that steam 
comes into contact with the materials to be sterilized. It is 
common practice in hospitals to overwrap goods to be sterilized 
with a cloth wrapping to ensure that the sterile material will 
not become contaminated
