<ABSTRACT>
A multi-hull craft comprises two spaced substantially 
parallel hulls (14, 15) and a third hull (16) lying between the 

lines of the two spaced hulls (14, 15) and/or extensions 
thereof. The third hull (16) is relatively movable with respect 

to the two spaced hulls (14, 15) so as to have a different 
heading from the two spaced hulls for steerage of the craft. 
In order to enable the craft to be steered easily without 
requiring the application of high steering forces by the 

helmsman the two spaced hulls (14, 15) and the third hull 
(16) are inflatable.
