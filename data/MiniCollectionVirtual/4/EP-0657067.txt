<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is a solar cell system in which the voltage required by the users of the direct electric current produced by a solar cell generator (6) is obtained via electronic voltage converters (2). The cell surfaces are thus not sub-divided but left whole. The electric current produced is put into the desired form (frequency, voltage) by electronic auxiliaries. Large-area, amorphous, thin-film solar cells (1) are used. The thin-film solar cells (1) of the proposed solar cell system are fitted with special current collector systems (4, 5, 8, 10, 15) capable of carrying the heavy currents. In a solar cell generator (6) the thin-film solar cells (1) are connected either in parallel or in pairs in a mid-point connexion. Conventional voltage converters (2) are used with components made in accordance with modern technology capable of carrying heavy currents.
