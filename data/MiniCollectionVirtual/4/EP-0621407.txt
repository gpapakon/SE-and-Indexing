<ABSTRACT>
A valve assembly is proposed which can be used in connection with the control of fluid-actuated devices (1). It contains at least two fluid distributors (3, 4) which are arranged to follow one another in a mounting direction (5) and are of different construction from one another at least due to the different configurations of their mounting sides (37, 37') facing one another. They serve to fit valves (6, 7) of different basic type. An adapter part (35) is provided between two dissimilar fluid distributors (3, 4) of this type which follow one another. The adapter part (35) connects these fluid distributors (3, 4) and if need be interlinks internal fluid passages (17, 17'; 26, 26'). In this way, valve assemblies (2) can be constructed which contain various types of valves (6, 7).

Valve station (2) for use in connection with the control of 
fluid-actuable apparatus, for example working cylinders, with a 

fluid distributor, equippable with valves (6, 7) and having 
internal fluid passages which communicate with the existing 

valves, characterized in that the valve station (2) contains at 
least two non-identical fluid distributors (3, 4), consecutively 

arranged in one direction of mounting (5) and differing from one 
another in design by the varying form of their facing mounting 

sides (37, 37'), which are provided for equipping with valves (6, 
7) of differing basic type, wherein an adapter element (35) is 

provided between two consecutive non-identical fluid distributors 
for connecting them and where necessary for connecting together 

internal fluid passages (17, 17'; 26, 26') of both fluid 
distributors (3, 4). 
Valve station according to claim 1, characterized in that the 

adapter element (35) has for the supply of pressure medium at 
least one connection opening (21) which communicates with a 

supply channel (38, 39) inside the adapter element (35) which 
leads into one or both the connection sides (36, 36') of the 

adapter element (35) facing the mounting sides (37, 37') of the 
adjoining fluid distributors (3, 4) in such a way that it lies 

opposite an opening of a fluid passage of the respectively-assigned 
fluid distributor (3, 4) acting as supply-distributor 

channel (17, 17'). 
Valve station according to claim 2, characterized in that 
only one installed fluid distributor (3) or both installed fluid 

distributors (3, 4) simultaneously can be supplied with pressure 
medium through a connection opening (21) of the adapter element 

(35).  
 
Valve station according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that an adapter element (35) makes possible a supply of pressure 

medium in addition to a supply of pressure medium similarly 
effected at another point (21'). 
Valve station according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the adapter element (35) has one or more 

vent openings (53) communicating with one or more vent channels 
(40) inside the adapter element (35) and leading to one or both 

connection sides (36, 36') of the adapter element (35) facing a 
mounting side of the adjoining fluid distributor (3, 4) in such 

a way that they lie opposite an opening of a fluid passage of the 
respectively-assigned fluid distributor (3, 4) acting as venting 

manifold (26, 26'). 
Valve station according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the adapter element (35) has a continuous 

first electrical wiring assembly (55) extending between its two 
connection sides (36, 36') facing the mounting sides (37, 37') 

of the adjoining fluid distributors (3, 4), and communicating 
with second electrical wiring assemblies (32, 32'), which serve 

to transmit electrical control signals for the valves and run in 
or adjacent to the two fluid distributors (3, 4). 
Valve station according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that it has a distributor unit (13) from which 

the existing valves (6, 7) receive their electrical control 
signals, and to which one of the two non-electrical fluid 

distributors (3, 4) is attached by that side opposite the adapter 
element (35). 
Valve station according to claim 7 in combination with claim 
6, characterized in that the distributor unit (13) communicates 

with the electrical wiring assemblies (32, 32', 55).  
 
Valve station according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in 
that the distributor unit (13) contains a control unit, in 

particular programmable, or is designed as such. 
Valve station according to any of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the adapter element (35) may be equipped 

with a governor (56) which modifies the pressure of the pressure 
medium supplied in such a way that it can be used for fluid valve 

actuation. 
Valve station according to any of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that an adapter element (35) is provided at the 

end (46) of the fluid distributor assembly, wherein only one 
connection side (36) faces a fluid distributor (4), and a seal 

element (47) - in particular cover-like - is fitted to the other 
connection side. 
Valve station according to any of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that there are several adapter elements (35), 

each located between non-identical fluid distributors (3, 4). 
Valve station according to any of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the adapter elements present (35, 48) and 

the attached fluid distributors (3, 4) form a self-supporting 
unit. 
Valve station according to any of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that one or more fluid distributors (3, 4) is 

comprised of several distributor modules (58) which can be linked 
together in the direction of mounting (5) and are each equippable 

with one or more valves (6, 7).
