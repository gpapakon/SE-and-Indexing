<ABSTRACT>
A method of altering the phenotype of a bird comprises introducing a DNA molecule into the muscle tissue of a bird contained within an egg during in ovo incubation. The DNA molecule is selected to be effective to cause a change in phenotype, such as an increase in growth rate, feed efficiency, immune response, or a combination of these and other phenotypes in the bird after hatch. A DNA molecule may further be selected to increase disease resistance, induce disease prevention, or neutralize maternal antibodies by the expression of an antigen over a period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GENE TRANSFER IN BIRDS BY INTRODUCTION OF DNA INTO MUSCLE IN OVORelated Applications This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/826,030, filed 27 January 1992, the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.Field ofthe Invention This invention relates to the methods of altering the phenotype of birds by introducing foreign DNA into the muscle of birds.Background ofthe InventionCommercial poultry is an extremely important source of food. ' However, there has been comparatively little attention given to methods of producing useful changes in the phenotype of birds through genetic engineering technigues. This is unfortunate, because such technigues offer a much more rapid technique for introducing desirable phenotypic traits into birds than classical breeding techniques. 

 Currently, the most widely investigated method of gene transfection in poultry employs retroviral vectors. Exemplary is Souza et al., J. Exptl. Zool. 232, 465-473 (1984) , in which a retroviral vector encoding growth hormone was injected into the vascularized portion of the yolk sac of 9 day old embryos. See also Shuman and Shoffer, Poult. Sci. 65, 1437-1444 (1986) ; Salter et al.. Poultry Sci. 65, 1445-1468 (1986); Salter et al.. Virology 157, 236-240 (1987); Bosselman et al., Science 243. 533-535 (1989); and U.S. Patent No. 5,162,215 to Bosselman et al.Nabel et al. , Science 249 1285-1288 (1990) , and Wolff et al., Science 247, 1445-1468 (1990), state that transient expression of 2-5 months may be obtained from direct microinjection of DNA, but do not suggest how these techniques may be applied to genetically engineering poultry. Nabel et al. note that the expression of DNA encoding /3-galactosidase injected into porcine arterial segments was limited to the microinjection site. Acsadi et al. , New Biologist 3., 71- 81 (1991) state that yocardial cells were able to transiently express injected foreign genes.Simkiss et al. , Protoplasma 151, 164-166 (1989) indicate that primordial germ cells of Stage XVII embryos containing endogenous retroviral sequences can be transferred to comparable recipient Stage XVI embryos that lack the retroviral marker by cardiac puncture. At day 17 of incubation, dot blots on recipient birds showed donor DNA to be present in the gonads, and traces of donor DNA to be present in the liver and heart tissues. The expression of the injected DNA molecules was not reported.PCT Patent Application Serial No. US90/01515 discloses a method of
