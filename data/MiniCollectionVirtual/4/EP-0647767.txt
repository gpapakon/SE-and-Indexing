<ABSTRACT>
In the representative mode for practicing the invention disclosed herein for 
accurately positioning tubing-conveyed well bore apparatus in a well bore a retrievable MWD 

tool (32) having a radiation detector is positioned 
in the lower portion of a tubing string (12) carrying 

a tubing-conveyed perforator (17) carrying shaped explosive charges. 
Once the tubing string has 

been lowered into a well bore, the MWD tool is operated for transmitting signals which are 
representative of the radioactive characteristics of either a radioactive marker at a known 

depth or the formations adjacent to the MWD tool. The signals are correlated for 
determining the location of the tubing-conveyed perforator within the well bore. The 

correlated data is used for adjusting the tubing string so as to accurately position the tubing-conveyed 
perforator at a desired depth location.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to perforation of well bores and, more specifically, to 
the positioning of perforating guns in the well bore adjacent to the formations to be 
perforated. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that so-called "tubing-conveyed perforators" 
are frequently employed to conduct perforating operations in those deviated well bores where 
typical cable-suspended or so-called "wireline" perforating guns cannot be effectively 
utilized. Moreover, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,509,604, a technique that is widely 
used for completing deviated well bores as well as those well bores which traverse multiple 
formations is to dependently couple a tubing-conveyed perforating-and-testing tool to a tubing 
joint and progressively lower the tool assembly into a cased well bore by successively 
assembling a tubing string of sufficient length for dependently positioning the tool assembly 
at a selected depth location in the well bore. Once the tool assembly has been positioned, a 
packer included with the assembly is expanded into sealing engagement with the casing for 
isolating that portion of the well bore lying below the expanded packer. To establish fluid 
communication with the earth formations adjacent to the isolated well bore portion, shaped 
explosive charges mounted in one or more enclosed-carrier perforators on the lower end of 
the tool assembly are actuated for perforating the steel casing and cement annulus between 
the casing and the adjacent borehole wall. Once the perforator has been fired, a test valve 
in the well tool is then selectively operated from the surface for controlling fluid 
communication between the perforated formation interval and the tubing string for conducting 
various flow and pressure tests of the connate fluids in the isolated earth formations. It is, of course, essential that these tubing-conveyed tools are accurately positioned 
in the well bore before the perforators are actuated. It will be particularly appreciated that  
 
the accurate positioning of those perforators is even more critical where the formation 
intervals to be perforated are relatively thin. Typically, a perforating operation is carried out 
by referring to logs previously made in that well bore which show parameters of the earth 
formations traversed by the borehole as well as the precise upper and lower depth boundaries 
of those formations. By consulting such prior logs, these perforators are assembled in 
advance with their respective shaped charges being arranged within
