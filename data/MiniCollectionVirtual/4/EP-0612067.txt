<ABSTRACT>
Additional information for each musical program is 
automatically recorded on an optical disc. A digital 

voice signal reproduced from a mini-disc (2) is sent to an MD 
system (8) via a digital voice signal line (5) and recorded on 

another mini-disc. Additional information such as the 
title of a musical program is sent via a serial 

communication line 6 to a MD control microcomputer and 
stored in its RAM which stores U-TOC information. The U-TOC 

information stored in RAM is recorded on the mini-disc 
before it is dismounted from the MD system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dubbing apparatus
for recording a signal reproduced from a recording medium
on an optical disc. More particularly, the invention
relates to an optical disc dubbing apparatus capable of
automatically recording additional information of each
musical program, capable of resuming the record operation
even if an unrecorded area of an optical disc becomes
absent, by erasing the already recorded track area, and
capable of recording the track numbers of musical
programs in the order different from the order of the
reproduced musical programs.There is known a mini-disc (MD) which is an optical
disc in which a user can write data. A mini-disc is
formed with a pit information record area at the central
area of the disc and a recordable area at the outer area.
The recordable area includes a user's TOC (Table of
Contents) area (U-TOC) and a program area. The
recordable area has no pit, but a groove is
engraved for the guidance to tracks. Information is 
recorded in the recordable area along the groove.The groove sways like wobble. The rotation of the
disc is controlled by a signal having an average
frequency of 22.05 kHz and generated based on the wobble.
Absolute addresses relative to the record start position
are FM-modulated and recorded in the wobble.Data record is achieved by magnetizing a magnetic
film. Namely, the magnetic film is heated to a Curie
point or higher by a laser spot while applying a magnetic
field which reverses its polarity depending upon an input
signal. The signal is therefore recorded in the magnetic
film as a change in the magnetization direction. Such
data record can be performed even on an already recorded
area, i.e., data overwrite is possible.The record position is managed by the information
recorded in U-TOC. Recorded in the program area is
information including a start time, end time, title, and
the like for each track number (TNO) which is a natural
number beginning with "1" and assigned to each musical
program. If TNO and its additional information are
erased from U-TOC, the corresponding recordable
area is handled as an unrecorded area.When an MD disc is loaded on an optical disc player,
U-TOC information recorded in the MD disc is read and
copied to a RAM. Thereafter, data recording/reproducing 
is managed by the U-TOC information stored in RAM. Each
time a musical program is recorded or erased, the
contents of RAM are updated and recorded in U-TOC before
the disc is unloaded from the apparatus.In erasing a musical program recorded in such a
mini-

An optical disc dubbing apparatus wherein:

a digital voice signal output terminal of an optical disc reproduction apparatus
(2) for reproducing a musical program from a source optical disc having a TOC

area storing the start address, end address, and additional information for each
musical program is connected via a digital voice signal line (5) to a digital

signal input terminal of an optical disc record apparatus (8) for recording each
musical program in a program area of a target optical disc and the start

address, end address, and additional information for each musical program in
a TOC area of said target optical disc;
a first microcomputer (1) for controlling said optical disc reproduction apparatus
(2) is connected via a digital communication line (6) separate from said digital

voice signal line (5) to a second microcomputer (7) for controlling said optical
disc record apparatus (8);
said second microcomputer (7) has means for instructing said first
microcomputer (1) to reproduce each musical program in a predetermined

order and has means for recording a digital voice signal received from said
optical disc reproduction apparatus (2) on said target optical disc; and
said second microcomputer (7) has means for receiving from, said first
microcomputer (1) the additional information transmitted separately from said

digital voice signal and for storing the received additional information in a RAM,
and for recording the start address, end address, and the additional information

for each musical program stored in said RAM on said TOC area of said target
optical disc before said target optical disc is dismounted from said optical disc

record apparatus (8).
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein: 

said optical disc record apparatus (8) is capable of over-writing a musical
program in said target optical disc; and
said second microcomputer (7) has means for making said optical record
apparatus (8) enter a record pause state when said second microcomputer (7)

judges that there is not enough unrecorded area left on said target optical disc
and for instructing said first microcomputer (1) to make said optical disc

reproduction apparatus (2) enter a reproduction pause state at the data position
when the record was intercepted, whereby after a desired recorded track area

of said target optical disc is erased by a user, the reproduction and record are
resumed to continue the record at the erased recorded area.
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein said second microcomputer (7) is
adapted to judge that an unrecorded area of said target optical disc becomes

absent by comparing a record interruption address and TOC information of the
target optical disc stored in said RAM.
The apparatus according to claim 2 or 3, wherein said reproduction and
record operation are resumed by said second microcomputer (7) by a user

pushing a designated key.
The apparatus according to any of claims 2 to 4, wherein said second
microcomputer (7) has means for storing data representing a link between a

record interruption address and a record start address in said RAM.
The apparatus of any preceding claim, wherein:

when the user designates a desired order of track numbers of musical
programs to be recorded, supplies the desired order to said second

microcomputer (7), and instructs to record, said second microcomputer (7) has 
means for instructing said first microcomputer (1) to reproduce each musical

program from the source optical disc, and records the voice signal received
from said optical disc reproduction apparatus (2) on a target optical disc; and
said second microcomputer (7) has means for storing the designated track
number added to each recorded musical program in a RAM, and for recording

the designated track number added to each recorded musical program on a
TOC area of said target optical disc.
