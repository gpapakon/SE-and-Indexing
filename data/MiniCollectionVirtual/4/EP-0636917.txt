<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal display that can eliminate viewing angle dependence.A liquid crystal display (LCD) includes a
pair of substrates and a liquid crystal layer (liquid
crystal cell) sandwiched between them, and produces a
display by altering the orientation of the liquid
crystal molecules in the liquid crystal layer and
thereby changing the optical refractive index within
the liquid crystal cell. Accordingly, the liquid
crystal molecules need to be aligned in an orderly
manner within the liquid crystal cell.One method commonly used to align the liquid
crystal molecules in a given direction involves forming
an alignment film on the liquid crystal layer side of
each substrate and controlling the substrate surface
condition in such a manner as to interact with the
liquid crystal molecules. Acording to this method, a
liquid crystal alignment film material is first applied
on the facing surfaces of the pair of substrates, and
then dried and cured to form an alignment film on each
surface, and preferential orientation is given by
rubbing the surface of the alignment film with a nylon
cloth or the like (rubbing method).An inorganic alignment film or an organic
alignment film may be used as the alignment film for 
the above purpose. Oxides, organic silanes, metals,
and metallic complexes are examples of the inorganic
alignment film materials. As the organic alignment
film materials, polyimide resins are widely used; by
rubbing the polyimide film surface formed on the substrate,
the liquid crystal molecules can be aligned in
a given direction.Of such liquid crystal displays, thin-film
transistor (TFT) liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCDs) are
constructed using twisted nematic liquid crystals. In
the TN liquid crystal display, the liquid crystal
molecules are arranged with their long axes lying
substantially parallel to the pair of substrates and
gradually twisting through 90° between them; when a
voltage is applied between electrode conductive lines
formed on the respective substrates and an electric
field is formed in a direction perpendicular to the
substrates, the molecular alignment is altered with the
liquid crystal molecules being caused to line up in the
direction of the electric field by virtue of the dielectric
anisotropy of the liquid crystal, thus producing
a change on the optical refractive index within the
liquid crystal layer.In such a TN liquid crystal display, since
the liquid crystal molecules have the property of
refractive index anisotropy (birefringence), a
