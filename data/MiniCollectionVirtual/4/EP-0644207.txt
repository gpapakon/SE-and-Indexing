<ABSTRACT>
A superabsorbent polymer having improved absorption under pressure and fast 
absorption rate is obtained by first providing a solution containing carboxylic acid 

monomers or water soluble salts thereof, and a crosslinking agent. A carbonate blowing 

agent and a polymerization initiator are added, individually or in combination, to the 
solution to form a carbonated monomer solution. A polymerization initiator is then added 

to the carbonated monomer solution which is then polymerized at temperatures ranging 
from about 0°C to about 130°C, forming a microcellular hydrogel. The microcellular 

hydrogel is chopped or ground into gel pieces having a particle diameter ranging from 
about 0.1 mm to about 5.0 cm. The gel pieces are dried at temperatures ranging from 

about 85°C to about 210°C, and are then ground to form a polymer having a particle size 
of from about 0.05 mm to about 5.0 mm. A mixture is formed from 100 parts by weight 

of the polymer and about 0.001 to about 30 parts by weight of a surface crosslinking 
agent. The polymer is reacted with the surface crosslinking agent to crosslink molecular 

chains existing on a surface of the polymer, forming the superabsorbent polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to superabsorbent polymers exhibiting improved absorption under pressure
and fast absorption rates. This invention particularly relates to providing a surface crosslinked superabsorbent polymer
which incorporates a blowing agent.Superabsorbent polymers are water insoluble, hydrogel-forming polymers capable of absorbing large quantities
of aqueous fluids including synthetic urine, brines, and biological fluids such as urine, sweat, and blood, while retaining
the absorbed fluids under pressure. Hydrogel-forming superabsorbent polymers are useful as absorbents for water
and aqueous body fluids when the polymers are incorporated in absorbent articles, such as disposable diapers, adult
incontinence pads, sanitary napkins, and bandages. Many of the existing superabsorbents are formed from unsaturated
carboxylic acid monomers including acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, alkylacrylates, and acrylamides which are rendered
water insoluble by crosslinking.The degree of crosslinking affects the absorbent capacity and gel strength of a superabsorbent. Capacity is a
measure of the amount of fluid which a given amount of superabsorbent polymer will absorb. Gel strength indicates
the tendency of the hydrogel once formed to deform under an applied stress. Polymers exhibiting inadequate gel
strength will form a hydrogel which deforms and fills the void space in an absorbent article, inhibiting absorbent capacity
and fluid distribution throughout the article. Polymers having low absorbent capacity are incapable of absorbing a
sufficient amount of the fluid encountered in use of a diaper or other absorbent article. A polymer having a high gel
strength generally possesses a low absorption capacity, and a polymer having a high absorption capacity typically
possesses a low absorption rate because of gel blocking phenomenon or low gel strength after absorption.Another characteristic that a superabsorbent polymer must possess is an acceptable level of extractable, water
soluble polymer remaining within the superabsorbent. The extractable polymer can leach out of a hydrogel when fluids
contact the superabsorbent. The extractables that leach out of the superabsorbent apparently lower the absorption
speed and capacity of the superabsorbent, resulting in leakage of the fluid from an absorbent article.Commercially available superabsorbents generally possess sufficient capacity, but do not have adequate gel
strength, swell rate (i.e., absorption speed) and absorption under pressure for the
