amount calculated and an exchange rate set in advance, in order to collect fee in proportion to the number of game media 
which a player has acquired by the game ; third calculation means for calculating the difference between an equivalent 

dispensing amount calculated and an equivalent amount ; fourth calculation means for calculating the balance using an amount 
represented by amount data outputted from a note discriminator (22) and an equivalent amount as input amounts and an amount 

represented by data designating an amount and outputted from an amount selector switch (31) as a used amount ; and delivery 
control means for outputting a delivery instruction to a delivery mechanism (34) on the basis of data representing an amount,

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a game play media lending machine 
and a gaming machine system each having a charge collection 
function and a charge collection method in a gaming house and in 
particular to a game play media lending machine and a gaming 
machine system which can collect an additional charge when a 
player again uses previously won game play media to play a new 
game at a gaming machine and a charge collection method in a 
gaming house. A first collection method of game play charges in a gaming 
house containing gaming machines such as pinball machines or 
slot machines is to rent game play media to players. By the way, when a player satisfies a given condition such 
as causing a game play medium (pinball) to enter a specific hole 
while playing a game at a gaming machine such as a pinball 
machine, a predetermined number of game play media are paid out  
 
to the player for a winning game play from the gaming machine. 
Therefore, as the player wins game plays, he or she holds an 
increasing number of game play media. If the player quits playing when he or she holds a reasonable 
quantity of game play media, the player inputs the held game play 
media to a game play media counter for counting the number of 
game play media, and receives a receipt on which the count result 
is recorded. The player passes the receipt to a person at a prize 
exchange counter or window for exchanging it for a proper prize. 
At this time, exchangeable prizes are selected in the range of the 
conversion amount found by multiplying the lending amount, which 
in turn found by multiplying the number of game play media by the 
lending unit price, by a predetermined exchange rate allowing for 
a profit. Therefore, when the player exchanges the won game play 
media for prizes, the gaming house can collect the charge 
corresponding to the number of the game play media. By the way, some players might want to use the won game 
play media again to play a game at a gaming machine later, rather 
than to exchange them for prizes. Then, for the convenience of such players, the gaming house 
can pay out game play media in exchange for a receipt on which 
the number of game play media is recorded so that the player can 
use the game play media to play a new game. In this case, however, the following problems arise: First, 
it takes time and labor and is undesirable for personnel in the  
 
gaming house to receive the receipt and pay out as many game 
play media as the number recorded on the receipt manually, as a 
count error may
