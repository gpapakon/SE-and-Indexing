<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
thermoplastic resin composition and a method of molding
the composition.Recently heat-resistant thermoplastic resins
have been used as engineering plastics for machine
materials or electronic parts. In molding a
thermoplastic resin, in order to improve productivity, it
has been proposed to blend, for the purpose of reducing
melt viscosity, promoting crystallization and improving
mold releasability, various resin modifiers, e.g., fatty
acids such as stearic acid, metal salts of fatty acids,
ester derivatives prepared from a fatty acid with a
polyhydric alcohol such as pentaerythritol, polyethylene
glycol or the like, aliphatic amides such as
ethylenebisstearamide, etc. (Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publications (Kokai) No. 44547/1985 and No. 250049/1991).However, since heat-resistant thermoplastic
resins generally have a high fusing temperature, said
resin additives may thermally decompose or boil when
melted, thereby tending to stain a mold or form void in 
the resin. For this reason, it has been desired to
develop heat-resistant resin modifiers.In view of the recent increasing need for
plastic materials of high performance, polyarylene
sulfide (PAS) excellent in heat resistance, mechanical
characteristics and chemical resistance is attracting
attention, and is now used for extending applications,
for example, as automotive parts, parts for precision
machines, electric and electronic parts, etc.PAS is a crystalline engineering plastic but
has low crystallization rate. Therefore, in order to
obtain a resin of sufficient mechanical strength by
injection molding, a high mold temperature of about 130°C
and a prolonged cooling time were necessary. This defect
posed a serious problem in extending the applications of
PAS, and it is desired to mold PAS in a short time at a
mold temperature of not higher than 100°C which is among
the molding conditions for resin-molding apparatus
commonly used.To solve this problem, there have been proposed
a method of increasing the mold releasability by adding a
fatty acid ester (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
No.154867/1992), an aromatic sulfonamide (Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication No.59279/1993) or the like,
and a method of promoting the crystallization by adding a 
modified polyalkylene glycol (Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication No.250049/1991) or an organic phosphoric acid
metal salt (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
No.142854/1990) or the like.However, because of insufficient heat
resistance of the resulting resin
