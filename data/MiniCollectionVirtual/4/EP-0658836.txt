<ABSTRACT>
This remote control system is consisting of a 
servomechanism (16) which transmits the movement of a 

first cable or control wire (1) connected to the control 
handle or pedal (13) to a second cable or wire (2) 

connected to the user (15). This servomechanism (16) is 
fitted with two idle (neutral) levers (3, 4), with 

cylindrical sector body (3', 4'), respectively connected 
to the above mentioned cables or wires (1, 2), a shaft 

(6) of a geared motor coaxially located between the two 
lever bodies (3', 4'), a spiral spring (5) fitted 

between the two bodies (3', 4') and the shaft (6) around 
which the spring is tightly wound, the opposite ends 

(5', 5'') of this spring (5) being outwards bent and 
penetrating the bodies (3', 4'), a transducer (7) 

monitoring the movement of the first control cable (1) 
and energizing an electronic control unit (8) driving 

the geared motor, so that this remote control may be 
actuated either electromechanically or by mechanical 

control in case of failure of the electrical components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention covers an electromechanical remote 
control system, especially designed for control of the 
motor and steering systems of boats, but also suitable 
for other drives, such as earthwork equipment and any 
other equipment requiring remote control of its drives 
and operation. At present, several remote control types are known based 
upon: 
a mechanical system an electrical system a flow dynamic system. The basic problems encountered by these remote control 
systems are related to their permanent efficiency, exact 
transmission of the movements from the control handle or 
foot lever to the user at minimal operator's effort. The known, purely mechanical system is based on rigid 
tie rods, flexible sheathed wires or cables connecting 
the control to the user. Although highly reliable, this 
system may be difficult, and hard to operate especially 
if there is a great distance between control and user 
and in presence of multiple series-connected drives. In 
the case of flexible cables, deformation of the latter 
may negatively affect control transmission and will thus 
increase the required control efforts. Electric or flow dynamic control systems have a greater 
accuracy and require less effort from the user, but 
being more complex, they are more failure prone, so that 
in case of black-out or defects, control is no longer 
possible. This is extremely dangerous for boats and 
water craft that would become ungovernable. This invention has the aim to eliminate the above 
mentioned drawbacks of known remote controls and to 
ensure an accurate control at minimal effort with the  
 
guarantee that this remote control system will always be 
efficient. It is known from GB-A-1.558.115 a servo device, which is 
primarily intended to facilitate and to amplify the 
transmission of remote control and particularly for 
reversing gear in motor boats. This servo device 
comprises a threaded draft, rotatably journalled through 
a housing and joined to a first lever at the outer end 
of which there is an attachment for an output control 
cable, and comprises a threaded servo nut, which is 
axially displaced on the threaded shaft and presents a 
radially directed second lever connected with the input 
control cable. On the faces of two gears facing the 
servo nut disposed between the gears, there are annular 
friction surfaces parallel with corresponding annular 
surfaces on the two sides of the nut. These gears 
rotate, by means of an electric motor, in opposite 
directions. Turning the control first lever in

a first flexible control cable (1) in an external 
sheath, connected to the handle or pedal (13) of a 

control unit (14), 
a second flexible driven cable (2) in an external 
sheath, connected to the user (15) to be operated,

movements of the first control cable (1) to the second 
driven cable (2), i.e. from the control handle or pedal 

(13) to the user (15), 
 
characterized by that it comprises: 


two coaxial idle levers (3, 4) connected rispectively 
with two cylindrical sector-shaped bodies (3', 4') 

covering an arc of slightly less than 180°, i.e. 180°-2α

driven cable (2), 
a driving shaft (6) of a geared motor coaxially placed

opposite direction to the pushing or pulling movement of

a transducer (7) mounted on the slide (11) and sensing 
these small displacements (X, Y) of the slide (11), 
an electronic monitoring unit (8) actuating the geared 
motor and its driving shaft (6) in both directions of 

rotation according to the movements (X, Y) of the slide
