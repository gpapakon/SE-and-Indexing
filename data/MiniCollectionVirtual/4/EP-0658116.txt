<ABSTRACT>
Treatment and prophylaxis of endotoxin caused toxicity is disclosed. This is accomplished by administering a lipid into which the endotoxin of concern is associated preferably together with a peptide which is not an apolipoprotein. Preferably, the two components are administered in the form of a reconstituted particle, although this is by no means required.

 METHODS USEFUL IN ENDOTOXIN PROPHYLAXIS AND THERAPYRELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 07/928,930 filed August 12, 1992.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the treatment of endotoxin poisoning. More particularly, it relates to the treatment of such poisoning via administration of various compositions which act to neutralize and/or remove endotoxins from the organism.BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ARTNormal serum contains a number of lipoprotein particles which are characterized according to their density, namely, chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL and HDL. They are composed of free and esterified cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, several other minor lipid components, and protein. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) transports energy, in the form of triglycerides, to the cells of the body for storage and use. As triglycerides are delivered, VLDL is converted to low density lipoprotein (LDL) . Low density lipoprotein (LDL) transports cholesterol and other lipid soluble materials to the cells in the body, while high density lipoprotein (HDL) transports excess or unusable to the liver for elimination. Normally, these lipoproteins are in balance, ensuring proper delivery and removal of a lipid soluble materials. Abnormally low HDL can cause a number of diseased states as well as constitute a secondary complication in others.Under normal conditions, a natural HDL is a solid particle with its surface covered by a phospholipid monolayer that encloses a hydrophobic core. Apolipoprotein A-I and A-II attach to the surface by interaction of the hydrophobic face of their alpha helical domains. In its 

nascent or newly secreted, form the particle is disk- shaped and accepts free cholesterol into its bilayer. Cholesterol is esterified by the action of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and is moved into the center of the disk. The movement of cholesterol ester to the center is the result of space and solubility limitations within the bilayer. The HDL particle "inflates" to a spheroidal particle as more and more cholesterol is esterified and moved to the center. Cholesterol ester and other water insoluble lipids which collect in the "inflated core" of the HDL are then cleared by the liver.Jonas et al., Meth. Enzv . 128A: 553-582 (1986) have produced a wide variety of reconstituted particles resembling HDL. The technique involves the isolation and dilapidation of HDL by standard methods (Hatch et al., Adv. Lip. Res. 6: 1-68 (1968); Scanu et
