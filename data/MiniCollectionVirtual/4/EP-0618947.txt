<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pressure-sensitive
adhesives formulated to exhibit the properties of a
permanent adhesive for use with paper and polymer film
backed labels and which remove cleanly from nonpaper
surfaces such as polymeric (plastic), glass and metal
substrates under the action of hot water or with hot
alkaline solutions such as household detergent
solutions or caustic alkali solutions with or without
use of some manual force to assist removal.Pressure-sensitive adhesives which are used for
label applications do not in general remove cleanly
from nonpaper substrates. Some residue of the adhesive
is left on the substrate thus making its cleaning less
effective or more involved. There is a growing need in
the market today for environmentally or user friendly
pressure-sensitive adhesive labels which can be cleanly
removed from the substrate during domestic or
industrial cleaning processes. This is true in the
case of price marking and product identification labels
used on metals, polymers (plastics), glass, wood and
painted or water resistant coated substrates.Attention in this regard has focused on water 
dispersible, water soluble, repulpable and wet stick
adhesives. Most of the base polymers for such
adhesives are not inherently pressure-sensitive
adhesives. Being nontacky they require the addition of
high levels of plasticizers and/or tackifiers.
Carboxyl content of the base polymer is also high,
exceeding 10% by weight of the polymer, such carboxyl
groups are incorporated into the polymer during
polymerization. When the base polymer used for a
removable adhesive is pressure-sensitive, it is usually
compounded with at least 10% by weight of a vinyl
carboxylic acid polymer either in the acid or salt form
and various amounts of plasticizers and/or tackifiers.U.S. Patent 4,033,918 to Hauber discloses a water
removable pressure-sensitive adhesive composition which
comprises based on 100 parts by weight of the total
solids, of from 25 to 35 parts by weight of a
crosslinked acrylic acid ester copolymer which contains
10 to 20% by weight of unsaturated carboxylic acid,
vinyl acetate, 2-ethyl hexyl acrylate, acrylonitrile,
diethyl maleate and mixtures thereof, from 10 to 20
parts by weight of an uncrosslinked acrylic acid ester
copolymer, from 10 to 20 parts by weight of
polyvinylmethyl ether, from 10 to 20 parts by weight of
an alkali metal and/or ammonium salt of polyacrylic
acid, polymethacrylic acid or a copolymer of acrylic
and methacrylic acids; 10 to 20 parts by weight of
monomeric plasticizer
