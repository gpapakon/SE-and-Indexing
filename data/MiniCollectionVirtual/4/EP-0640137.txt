<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the construction and application of
recombinant vectors containing DNA sequences for encoding, and efficient expression of,
enzymatically active cytochromes P450 in mammalian cells. The invention also is related
to immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells containing various cytochrome P450 genes
and the uses of these cells.The cytochromes P450 are a large family of hemoprotein enzymes capable
of metabolizing xenobiotics such as drugs, carcinogens and environmental pollutants as
well as endobiotics such as steriods, fatty acids and prostaglandins. Some members of the
cytochrome P450 family are inducible in both animals and cultured cells, while other
constitutive forms are non-inducible. This group of enzymes carry out beneficial
metabolic activities by detoxification of xenobiotics as well as harmful metabolic
conversion of xenobiotics to toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic forms (Gelboin, Physiol.
Rev., 60:1107-1166, 1980).In animals, multiple molecular forms of cytochrome P450s are expressed
simultaneously and they all exhibit common physical and biological properties. The 
multiplicity and common properties of cytochromes P450 make it difficult to separate their
different forms, especially the minor forms. Even in situations where P450 cytochromes
have been isolated in purified form by conventional enzyme purification procedures, they
have been removed from the natural biological membrane association and therefore require
the addition of NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and other cell fractions for enzymatic
activity. These additional factors have prevented a clearer understanding of the role and
function of the individual cytochrome forms in metabolism, detoxification, and activation
of both xenobiotic and endobiotic substrates.Toxicological testing of drugs, potential carcinogens, food products, food
additives and food contaminants has been performed in animals and more recently in in
vitro systems, such as bacteria (Ames test) and animal cell culture models. These systems
are disadvantaged since they do not have human-specific metabolism. Therefore,
extrapolation to determine the human risk is difficult and potentially inaccurate. The
bacterial test systems and some of the animal cell culture models lack complete metabolic
activity and would not detect any harmful compounds which depend upon activation by
metabolic pathways, for example, by the cytochrome P450 enzymes. In the past this
situation was circumvented by adding metabolizing enzyme isolated from rat
