<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic resins 
and methods for producing said resins utilizing a single 
component heterocyclic amine catalyst system. More 
particularly, the invention relates to resins such as high 
molecular weight polycarbonate resins that are produced by 
a solventless melt condensation reaction between diphenol 
carbonate (DPC) and bisphenol A (BPA) in the presence of a 
heterocyclic amine catalyst. A large number of catalytic systems have been examined 
for application to melt polycarbonates. Most of these 
methods require either a variety of co-catalysts or the 
subsequent addition of a catalyst quencher to ensure 
polymer stability. The need for high purity, high quality 
thermoplastic resins requires the reduction of residual 
contaminants in the final resin. This need for minimal 
residual impurities is particularly acute in optical 
quality (OQ) grade polycarbonate resins. One approach 
towards elimination of residual solvent contamination -- 
particularly methylene chloride -- is through the 
implementation of a solventless (melt) process. Most current melt technology programs employ a two 
component catalyst system. The first component is  
 
tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH or β-catalyst) which is 
used to initiate oligomer formation in the melt. The TMAH 
decomposes in the first two reactors to produce a variety 
of products, some of which contaminate the final polymer. 
The second catalyst is sodium hydroxide ("sodium" or Na: 
the α-catalyst) which is the finishing catalyst. Due to 
its intrinsic stability, the α-catalyst must be quenched. 
This quenching process requires the addition of yet another 
component to the polymer formulation. All the materials 
from the quenching process remain in the final resin, 
further contaminating the final polymer. The use of a thermally stable, volatile heterocyclic 
amine catalyst circumvents the degradation problem of the 
β-catalyst and the need for additional reagents due to the 
use of an α-catalyst. The advantage of volatile amines are 
that they are "self-quenching", i.e., these catalysts 
slowly distill from the resin over the course of the 
reaction. As a result, no additional quencher is needed 
and no detrimental catalyst residue is left in the final 
resin. A variety of basic nitrogen heterocyclic catalysts and 
complex nitrogen-containing organic bases were examined for 
their efficiency to form thermoplastic resins in general, 
and bisphenol A ("BPA") polycarbonates in particular. The 
following amines exhibit
