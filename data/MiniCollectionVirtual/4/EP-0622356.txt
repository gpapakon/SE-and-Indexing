<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
indoloylguanidine derivatives. The present invention
also relates to sodium/proton (Na+/H+) exchanger
inhibitors comprising the indoloylguanidine derivatives
as the active component which are useful for the treatment
and prevention of diseases caused by increased
sodium/proton (Na+/H+) exchanger activity.Certain polycyclic aroylguanidine derivatives
are known as those having polycondensed rings, for
example, a naphthalene, 9,10-dihydroanthracene,
benzofuran, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, benzothiophene,
benzothiazole, methylenedioxybenzene, pyridothiophene,
pyrimidothiophene, quinoline, 1,6-naphthylidine, 1,8-naphthylidine,
3,4-dihydrobenzopyran, 3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one,
1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolin-2-one,
quinoxaline, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoxaline,
benzoazepine, benzotriazepine, benzimidazolothiazine,
benzopyranopyran or benzocarbazole ring. As one of the
aroylguanidine derivatives having indole rings there is
known 1-guanidino-carbonyltryptophane but this compound
is merely registered in Chemical Abstracts under
Registered No. 18322-34-4, without any reference to its source. Turning to some monocyclic aroylguanidine
derivatives, pyrazinoylguanidine derivative represented by,
e.g., Amiloride, are known to exhibit the sodium/proton
(Na+/H+) exchanger inhibition activity and anti-arrhythmic
activity, cf., J. Membrane Biol., Vol. 105, 1 (1988); and
Circulation, Vol. 79, 1257 (1989). Recent reports also
reveal that benzoylguanidine derivatives possess the
sodium/proton (Na+/H+) exchanger inhibition and
anti-arrhythmic activities, cf., J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol., Vol.
24, Supple. I, S. 92 (1992); ibid., Vol. 24, Suppl. I, S. 117
(1992); and Japanese Patent KOKAI Nos. 3-106858 and 5-339228.DE-A-4,127,026 discloses a pyrazine derivative of
formula:

wherein
R1 is hydrogen or a C1-C8 alkyl group,R2 is a number of different group, andR3 to R6 are each hydrogen, a C1-C8 alkyl group or a
benzyl group.EP-A-116,360 discloses an indol derivative of
formula:

wherein
R1 is an aliphatic or aromatic acyl group or a benzyl
group,R2 is hydrogen or an alkyl group,R3 to R5 are hydrogen, a halogen, an alkyl group or
an alkoxy group,R6 is hydrogen, a halogen, an alkyl group or an
alkoxy group, and, when R5 is hydrogen, a nitro or 
trifluoromethyl group, andR7 and R8 are hydrogen or alkyl or together form a
heterocyclic group.EP-A-639,573 has overlapping priority and filing
dates with the present application. It discloses a compound
of formula:

wherein
X is N or CR6,Y is O, S or NR7,A and B
