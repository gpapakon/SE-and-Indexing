<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inserts useful in 
microwavable containers. The invention can further 
comprise fibers which are capable of spontaneously 
transporting fluid on the surface thereof. There is a need in the microwave food industry for 
inserts useful in microwavable containers that are more 
efficient in removing excess grease and moisture from 
food during cooking in a microwave oven. A wide variety of inserts useful in microwavable 
food containers have been developed to improve the 
quality of food cooked in a microwave oven. For 
instance, it is known to place a liquid absorbent pad 
within a package for absorbing food byproducts such as 
moisture and grease exuded from food during cooking in a 
microwave oven (U.S. Patent No. 4,873,101). Such pads 
must not only provide sufficient capacity for the 
quantity of food byproducts produced during cooking, but 
must withstand the elevated temperatures required to 
adequately cook the precooked or cured foods discussed 
above without degradation. Similarly, U.S. Patents 4,954,356 and 4,857,342 
disclose a microwavable package for storing and cooking 
a food product including an absorbent bed enclosed 
within a sealed plastic sleeve. Also, U.S. Patent 
4,950,524 discloses a bacon pad made of liquid absorbent 
wood fibers. U.S. Patent 4,786,513 discloses a package 
of sliced bacon containing an absorbent blotter means. U.S. Patent 4,873,101 discloses a package of food 
containing a substantial amount of water and solidified  
 
grease that can be cooked within the package in a 
microwave oven. The package further comprises a pad 
adjacent the food comprising microwave radiation 
transparent generally hydrophobic liquid grease 
absorbing materials that are capable of holding the 
amount of grease in the food when it is melted. U.S. Patent No. 5,094,869 describes a food 
degreaser which uses a layer of absorbent fiber on the 
inside of a wicking material envelope. Other known grease absorbing pads have been found 
to be useful, such as the insulating product which is 
sold under the trade designation "Thinsulate" by 
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, St. Paul, 
Minnesota, in densities of 40, 100 and 200 grams/m² and 
absorbs or holds 15, 16 and 9 1/2 times its own weight 
of grease, respectively; the products sold under the 
trade designation "Oil Sorbent" and "Insorb Industrial 
Wipe" by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, 
St. Paul, Minnesota, which have densities of 36 and 70 
grams/m², respectively, and absorb or hold 14 and 8
