<ABSTRACT>
A hydrophobic aerogel having excellent transparency is 
formed by the following process of the present invention. 

That is, a first gel having a SiOâ‚‚ skeleton structure is 
prepared by hydrolysis and condensation of an alkoxysilane 

compound in the presence of a solvent. The solvent contained 
in the first gel is replaced at least partially with a medium 

to form a second gel. The second gel is reacted with a 
hydrophobic agent having hydrophobic groups as well as 

functional groups reactive with silanol groups under a 
supercritical condition of the medium to form a hydrophobic 

gel. The medium contained in the hydrophobic aerogel is 
removed by a supercritical drying method, so that the 

hydrophobic aerogel having improved transparency and an 
extremely fine porous structure is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a process of forming a hydrophobic aerogel having excellent transparency, which
is characterized by reacting a gel having a SiO2 skeleton structure with a hydrophobising agent under a supercritical
condition of a medium contained in the gel.An aerogel is useful as a heat insulator having excellent transparency. As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,402,927,
No.4,432,956 and No. 4,610,863, an aerogel is formed by the following process. That is, hydrolysis and condensation
of an alkoxysilane are performed in the presence of a solvent to prepare a gel having a SiO2 skeleton structure. The
alkoxysilane is also named as a silicon alkoxide or alkylsilicate. After the solvent contained in the gel is replaced with a
medium, the medium is removed from the gel by a supercritical drying method to obtain the aerogel.However, since the SiO2 skeleton structure of the aerogel includes silanol groups having hydrophilicity at the surface
thereof, there is a problem that the silanol groups adsorb moisture in the atmosphere as the aerogel is used for
many hours, so that optical and thermal properties of the aerogel are lowered, and also a distortion or shrinkage crack
of the aerogel occurs.For solving the problem, International Application No. PCT/JP92/00156 discloses a process of forming a hydrophobic
aerogel. In the process, after hydrolysis and condensation of an alkoxysilane are performed in the presence of a solvent
to prepare a gel having a SiO2 skeleton structure, the gel is reacted with a hydrophobising agent to form a
hydrophobic gel. The solvent contained in the hydrophobic gel is replaced with a medium, and then the medium is
removed from the hydrophobic gel by a supercritical drying method to obtain the hydrophobic aerogel. However, since
a penetration rate of the hydrophobising agent into the gel is slow, there is a problem that it takes many hours for penetrating
the hydrophobising agent throughout the SiO2 skeleton structure of the gel. In addition, there is another problem
that the transparency of the hydrophobic aerogel is sightly lowered as compared with the transparency of the
unreacted aerogel with the hydrophobising agent. It is believed that such a decrease of transparency of the hydrophobic
aerogel is caused by insufficient penetration of the hydrophobising agent into the SiO2 skeleton structure of the gel.For solving the above problems, the present invention is directed to a process of forming a hydrophobic aerogel
having an improved transparency. That is, a gel
