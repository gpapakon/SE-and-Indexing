<ABSTRACT>
In order to reduce movement of a switch push 
button, a rocker switch has first and second tappets for 

engagement with first and second ends of the rocker. The 
tappets are mounted for movement with an operating member 

and pivot between inward and outward positions. A tappet 
presetting member projects from the rocker to preset the 

tappets so that with the rocker in a first position the 
first tappet is in its inward position to engage the rocker. 

Movement of the operating member thus causes the first 
tappet to move the rocker to its second position while the 

second tappet is in its outward position and free from the 
rocker. With the rocker in its second position, the second 

tappet is preset in its inward position to engage the 
rocker. When moved by the operating member it moves the 

rocker to its first position while the first tappet is in its 
outward position free from the rocker.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical switches. Electrical switches are known having contacts; a 
rocker mounted for pivotal movement between first and second 
stable positions, said contacts being closed in the first 
position of the rocker and open in the second position; an 
operating member, and means for translating successive 
movements of the operating member in one direction, into 
rocking movement of the rocker. Examples include push 
button switches in which repeated presses of the push button 
causes the rocker to rock between its first and second 
positions so closing and opening the contacts alternately. 
Further contacts may be included, e.g. to provide a change 
over facility. In one example, the tappet is biased more or less 
centrally and the rocker has a camming surface. No matter 
which position the rocker is in, when the tappet has 
retracted with the push button, ready for the next push 
operation, the camming surface presents a surface to the 
tappet which surface will guide the tappet to an abutment on 
the rocker such as to rock the rocker the other way. A problem with that arrangement is that it takes a 
substantial movement of the push button to move the tappet 
from its central position along the camming surface and into 
engagement with the relevant abutment. A solution to the problem is proposed in EP-A1-0 
232 765. Here the rocker is formed with a resilient 
web which engages the tappet beyond the axis of rotation of  
 
the tappet. Instead of remaining more or less central, the 
tappet is preset by the web towards one or other end of the 
rocker so as to meet the abutment after less travel of the 
push button. In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, 
an alternative solution is provided in which said means for 
translating successive movements of the operating member in 
one direction, into rocking movement of the rocker 
comprises: first and second tappets for engagement with 
first and second spaced ends of the rocker, said tappets 
being mounted for movement with the operating member and for 
pivotal movement in relation to the operating member for 
movement between inward and outward positions; and a tappet 
presetting member projecting from the rocker and movable 
therewith, operative on the tappets, between the rocker and 
their pivot, to preset the tappets so that with the rocker 
in the first position the first tappet is preset in its 
inward position to engage the rocker, when moved by the 
operating member, so as to move the rocker to its second 
positio

<CLAIMS>
An electrical switch, having at least two 
contacts, a rocker mounted for pivotal movement between 

first and second stable positions, said contacts being 
closed in the first position of the rocker and open in the 

second position, an operating member, and means for 
translating successive movements of the operating member in 

one direction, into rocking movement of the rocker, said 
means comprising: first and second tappets for engagement 

with first and second spaced ends of the rocker, said 
tappets being mounted for movement by the operating member 

and for pivotal movement in relation to the operating member 
for movement between inward and outward positions; and a 

tappet presetting member projecting from the rocker and 
movable therewith, operative on the tappets, between the 

rocker and their pivot, to preset the tappets so that with 
the rocker in the first position the first tappet is preset 

in its inward position to engage the rocker, when moved by 
the operating member, so as to move the rocker to its 

second position, said second tappet being in its outward 
position freeing the rocker for such movement, and so that 

with the rocker in the second position the second tappet is 
preset in its inward position to engage the rocker, when 

moved by the operating member, so as to move the rocker to 
its first position, said first tappet being in its outward 

position freeing the rocker for such movement. 
A switch as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the tappet presetting member is resilient. 
A switch as claimed in claim 2, wherein 
the tappet presetting member is a flexible blade. 
A switch as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein one contact is mounted on a snap action blade 

spring. 
A switch as claimed in claim 4, wherein 
the blade spring has two slots therein defining one central 

and two outer legs extending between two end portions, the 
blade being so formed that the outer legs have a different 

extent from the central leg. 
A switch as claimed in claim 5, wherein 
the blade spring is formed from a flat sheet of material, 

wherein the outer legs are, or the inner leg is, formed with 
a permanent bend or bends so as to shorten their or its 

extent thus to bend the other resiliently. 
A switch as claimed in claim 5 or 6, 
wherein the rocker is formed at one side of its pivot to 

engage the outer legs and at the other side of the pivot to 
engage the central leg, so that rocking from one to the 

other of said first and second positions causes the spring 
to snap between a position in which its contact engages the 

other contact and a position in which the contacts are 
separated. 
An electrical switch wherein one contact 
is mounted on a snap action blade spring having two slots 

therein defining one central and two outer legs extending 
between two end portions, the blade being so formed that the 

outer legs have a different extent from the central leg. 
A switch as claimed in claim 8, wherein 
 

the blade spring is formed from a flat sheet of material, 
wherein the outer legs are, or the inner leg is, formed with 

a permanent bend or bends so as to shorten their or its 
extent thus to bend the other resiliently. 
A switch as claimed in claim 8 or 9, 
including an operating member in the form of a rocker which 

is formed at one side of a pivot to engage the outer legs 
and at the other side of the pivot to engage the central 

leg, so that rocking from one to the other of said first and 
second positions causes the spring to snap between a 

position in which its contact engages another contact and a 
position in which the contacts are separated. 
A switch as claimed in any of claims 8 to 
10, wherein one end of the blade spring is fixed to a 

conductive support member.
