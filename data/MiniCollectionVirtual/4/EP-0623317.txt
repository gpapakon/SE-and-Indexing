<ABSTRACT>
A rotatable shaver having inner (60) and/or outer (32) 
non-metallic elongated blades for use in endoscopic 

surgical procedures. In one embodiment a rotatable, 
elongated non-metallic inner tubular member (60) is 

disclosed for use with a non-rotatable elongated metallic 
outer tubular member (32), the inner member having a 

flexible, non-metallic tubular body (64), a proximal hub 
and a distal tip provided with a cutting edge (66). The 

elongated tubular body (64) of the inner member (60) may be 
extruded or molded from a polymeric or composite material 

and may be bonded to or integrally formed with either the 
hub, the distal cutting tip of both. In one embodiment, 

the entirety of the rotatable inner tubular member (60, 80) 
(i.e. hub, tubular body and cutting tip) may be integrally 

formed as a single unit. In another embodiment, the outer 
tubular member (82) is formed with a non-metallic tubular 

sheath within which a metallic or non-metallic inner member 
(60) may rotate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to surgical cutting 
instruments and, more particularly, to rotating shaver 
systems having an elongated inner tubular cutting member 
rotating about its axis within an elongated outer tubular member 
having a cutting window at its distal end which cooperates with 
the inner member to cut, resect or abrade bodily tissue, the 
resulting loose tissue being aspirated through the lumen of the 
inner member. The use of elongated surgical cutting instruments has 
become well accepted in performing closed surgery such as 
arthroscopic or, more generally, endoscopic surgery. In closed 
surgery, access to the surgical site is gained via one or more 
portals, and instruments used in the surgical procedure must be 
elongated to permit the distal ends of the instruments to reach 
the surgical site. Some conventional surgical cutting 
instruments (shavers) for use in closed surgery are rotary 
powered and have a straight, elongated outer tubular member and 
a straight, elongated inner tubular member concentrically  
 
disposed in the outer tubular member. The inner and outer 
members both separately and jointly are sometimes referred to in 
the art as "blades". The outer member has a distal end having 
an opening in the end or side wall (or both) to form a cutting 
port or window and the inner member has a distal end disposed 
adjacent the opening in the distal end of the outer member. The 
inner member is easily insertable into and removable from the 
outer member to facilitate cleaning or interchanging parts. 
Each of the elongated members has a hub or termination at its 
proximal end in order to attach the components to a rotary drive 
means. The distal end of the inner tubular member has a cutting 
means or cutting edge for engaging tissue via the opening in the 
distal end of the outer tubular member. In many cases (but not 
all) this distal cutting means cooperates with the opening in the 
outer member to shear, cut or trim tissue. In some cases, such 
as abrading burrs, the opening in the outer member merely allows 
access to the tissue and does not otherwise cooperate with the 
cutting means. The term "cutting edge" or "cutting means" as 
used herein is intended to include abrading (e.g. burrs) and 
other devices whether or not there is any traditional cutting or 
shaving action and whether or not there is any cooperative 
shearing action. The inner tubular member is rotatably driven 
about its axis from its proximal end, normally via a handpiece 
having a small electric motor

a non-metallic, non-perforated, elongated tubular 
inner body (64) having a proximal end and a distal end, 

the inner tubular body (64) has a 
predetermined rigidity less than that of the outer tubular
