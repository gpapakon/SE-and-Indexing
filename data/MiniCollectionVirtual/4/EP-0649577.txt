<ABSTRACT>
A fault-tolerant reluctance motor has a multiphase stator winding. The stator (2) has a different number of poles from the rotor (5). The lead angle and the pole angle ((beta)s, (beta)r) embraced by each stator and rotor pole (3, 5) is at least the same as twice the step angle (a): (epsilon)=360 /(q.Nr), where (q) is the number of phases and (Nr), is the number of rotor poles. In particular, the stator has ten poles, the rotor has six poles and the stator winding has five phases. Such a reluctance motor starts up from any motor position in one or other direction of rotation, even when one of the phase windings (6, 7) is completely or partially ineffective owing to a fault.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fault-tolerant 
reluctance motor, in which the stator has a different 
number of poles from the rotor, the stator winding 
formed by the coils associated with the stator poles is 
multi-polar, and a control device is provided which 
switches the individual phases on cyclically through a 
respective lead angle, the rotor, during normal 
operation, starting up from an arbitrary position 
selectively in one or other direction and, on the 
occurrence of a fault, continuing to run with reduced 
torque. Reluctance motors in which a fault in the system, 
such as the failure of a phase winding, whether as a 
result of line break, short-circuiting, failure of the 
switch element or faults in the control system, does 
not lead to stopping of the motor, are known as fault-tolerant 
reluctance motors. According to US-PS 48 96 089, a four-phase motor 
with eight stator poles and six rotor poles is designed 
so that on failure of a phase it still continues to run 
with reduced torque. Because of the missing phase, 
however, dead zones are created, in which the motor 
does not start up again in each desired direction of 
rotation. On the contrary, the rotor first has to be 
rotated in the opposite direction before it is able to 
run in the desired direction. In a fault-tolerant reluctance motor of the kind 
described in the introduction (US-PS 48 96 088), this 
disadvantage is eliminated in that the phase windings 
do not, as is customary, consist of two series-connected  
 
and jointly switched pole coils, but of two 
individually switchable pole coils. When just the one 
pole coil is switched off on the occurrence of a fault, 
the other coil remaining in operation is sufficient to 
avoid a dead zone preventing start-up. This requires, 
however, twice the circuit complexity in the control 
device. In addition, it is frequently necessary to 
take the whole phase winding out of commission when a 
fault occurs. The invention is based on the problem of providing 
a fault-tolerant reluctance motor with which, even when 
a fault occurs at a random location in the motor, in 
the control electronics for the commutation or in the 
sensor arrangement for measuring the rotor position, 
continued operation of the motor, and in particular 
start-up of the rotor from any position selectively in 
one or other direction, is possible. This problem is solved according to the invention 
in that the lead angle as well as the pole angle 
embraced by each stator and rotor pole is at least the 
same as twice the
