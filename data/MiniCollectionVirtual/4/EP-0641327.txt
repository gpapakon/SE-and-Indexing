<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U. S.
application serial number 07/761,579 filed September 18,
1991.Most human cancers are treated by the use of radio
and/or chemotherapeutic agents. There are mainly two
problems associated with the use of such techniques in the
treatment of cancer, namely, adverse side effects and
resistance to the use of cytotoxic chemical agents. These
phenomena limit the usefulness of such therapies. Regulation
of the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic
progenitor cells is under the control of several growth
factors. It is well known that immunomodulators such as
interleukins, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
factors, tumor necrosis factor and bacterial lipopolysaccharides,
due to their ability to enhance hematopoietic
and immune functions, confer radio and chemoprotection.
Recently, swainsonine has been demonstrated to mimic growth
promoting activities of varioushematopoietic growth
factors and offer protection from radiation and cytotoxic
chemotherapy. S. L. White et al., Cancer Communications,
3(3), 83-91, 1991. Swainsonine, a plant alkaloid initially isolated from
Australian plant Swainsona canescens, has been demonstrated
to be a potent and specific inhibitor of golgi alpha-mannosidase
II, a glycoprotein processing enzyme.
(Colegate et al., Aust. J. Chem. 32: 2257 - 2264, 1979.)
Swainsonine has also been shown to have many other
biological effects including inhibition of tumor growth,
metastasis, augumentation of host immune effector
mechanisms and activation of protein kinase-C. (C. Kino et
al., J. Antibiotics, 38(7), 926 - 940, 1985.) Although it
is not clear by which mechanism(s) swainsonine offers
radio/chemoprotection, inhibitors of alpha-mannosidase and
analogs of swainsonine are expected to be useful as
radio/chemoprotective agents.Tetrahedron Letters, vol. 31, no 49, 1990 pp 7109-7112
discloses the compound 1S,2R,3S,4R,5R methyl[2,3,4-trihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopentyl]amine,
a potent
α-mannosidase inhibitor.Applicants have now discovered a new class of alpha-mannosidase
inhibitors which are useful as
immunomodulators, chemo- and radioprotective agents and as
antimetastatic agents.This invention relates to novel alpha-mannosidase
inhibitors of formula 1

substituted with one or two hydroxy groups, a
glycosyl group, or a group of the formula
-(CH2)n-Ar wherein n is an integer of from 1 to 4
