<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an improved drier for the continuous 
drying and conditioning treatment of hides or fabrics. 
Document FR-A-2368000 discloses a mechanical pasta drying 
process with stacked units containing belt conveyors in hot 
air circulation chamber, wherein each unit is equipped with 
an heater, a fan and control for moisture, temperature and 
air exchange. Document FR-A-2538887 discloses a multiconveyor for dehydrating 
fruits and vegetables, wherein the heating is 
provided by two indipendent hot air circuits, each circuit 
comprises an external duct containing an air heater, a fan, 
a controllable outlet for humid air and a controllable 
inlet for fresh air. It is a known fact that the drying and conditioning treatment 
of hides or fabrics, is carried out by means of 
driers, essentially consisting of a drying chamber into 
which the products are inserted and which is provided with 
a system for heating and dehumidifying. In particular, a continuous drier for hides being the 
object of the international application WO-A-93 19208 in the 
name of same inventor is known, wherein the hides are 
inserted into a drying chamber through a loading unit, said 
drying chamber presenting a plurality of drying belts, 
overlying another and receiving in succession the hides 
coming from the loading unit. At the end of the run of the drying belts, an unloading 
belt conveys the dried hides to the exterior. Said system is provided with a high-frequency unit for 
monitoring the humidity, and therefore for conditioning the 
expelled hide, and with a heating and dehumidifying system 
consisting of a heat pump in the drying chamber. One inconvenience that said drier presents is that the use 
of a heat pump for obtaining the heating and the dehumidification  
 
of the drying chamber, and therefore of the hides, 
is very costly. In fact, since the hides loaded into the drier contain 
humidity amounting to about 50% in weight, it is clear 
that it becomes very costly to eliminate such a great 
quantity of water by using a heat pump for the drying and 
dehumidifying process, considering that its optimum performance 
is achieved around 35°-37° C and, therefore, 
requires rather long drying times. The purpose of the present invention is to overcome such an 
inconvenience by obtaining a drier provided with an improved  
 
drying and dehumidifying unit which permits to 
reduce the drying times of the hides, as compared with the 
driers belonging to the known technique. Another purpose is that such a drying and
