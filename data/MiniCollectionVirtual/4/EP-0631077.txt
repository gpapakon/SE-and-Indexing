<ABSTRACT>
A household appliance, solenoid controlled, 
pilot actuated inlet water valve (20) has a diaphragm 

insert (56) with a bleed valve (106) that substantially 
closes when a main valve (24) is open to reduce water 

and contaminate flow through the bleed passage (28). A 
pilot valve outlet extension (82) has openings (88) to 

reduce vacuum drawn from the outlet (38) into an 
actuation chamber (58) thereby further reducing water 

flow through the bleed passage (28). The bleed passage 
(28) is internally and externally configured to reduce 

contamination impairment. An anti-hammer rib or lip (34) 
is placed on the pilot valve outlet extension (82) 

upstream of a guide tip (84) which provides less close-fitting 
surface that may be impaired by contaminates 

while still dampening valve closing to reduce valve 
noise and pipe hammer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solenoid controlled, pilot operated inlet water valves and
more specifically to water valves used in household appliances such as dishwashers and
clothes washing machines.Contamination, especially in the form of particulate matter, can impair the
operation or clog water valves. Contamination can take many forms including sand
particles, mineral particles, organic particles, mineral deposits, or other impurities. The
basic structure of a pilot actuated water valve provides many opportunities for contamination
to impair valve operation. There are small passages through which water must pass
such as an inlet screen, bleed passage and a pilot passage. There are also close fitting
parts that must move or seal such as the fitting between the pilot valve outlet extension
and the outlet and the seal between the diaphragm and valving surface.A water valve impairment can also take many forms including the following: a
complete bleed passage obstruction causing catastrophic valve failure; a partial bleed
passage obstruction slowing valve closing thereby wasting water; an obstruction between
the outlet and the pilot valve outlet extension causing valve failure; a partial obstruction
between the outlet and the pilot valve outlet extension causing slowed or incomplete
valve closing; an obstruction between a guide tube and armature that causes valve 
failure; or a partial obstruction between the guide tube and armature that interferes with
pilot valve operation.An impaired water valve often increases water consumption through incomplete
or slow closing. When an inlet water valve used in a household appliance is impaired
but still functional, it may be difficult for the appliance operator to recognize the
impairment because the water valve will leak to a holding tank or to a drain which may
not be visible to the appliance operator. If the water valve is impaired by closing more
slowly than designed, then water levels may be higher than desired or water volume may
be greater than desired or the water valve may direct some water directly into an open
drain. Unnecessary water consumption is not desirable, particularly when the water
wasted is hot water. Wasting of even small amounts of hot water increases energy
consumption.In prior art appliance inlet water valves 20P, such as shown in FIG. 1, a bleed
passage 28P is provided in a main valve 24P to allow pressure equalization between a
main chamber 60P and an actuation chamber 58P. The bleed passage 28P is open
when the main valve 24P is both

pilot valve outlet extension (82) for engaging the outlet

(38) reducing the area of the pilot valve outlet extension
(82) that engages the outlet (38) thus reducing the

outlet extension movement in the outlet (38); and,
(b) guiding the pilot valve outlet extension (82)
into the outlet (38) with a guide tip (85) on the

downstream end (86) of the pilot valve outlet extension
