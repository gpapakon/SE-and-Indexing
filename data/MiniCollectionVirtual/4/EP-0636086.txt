<ABSTRACT>
Device for packaging products, in particular bread, in bags, comprising a bearing guide (1) which guides a bearing part (2) which is driven in a reciprocating movement. The bearing part bears lower and upper scoops (7, 9) which can move relative to each other. During the movement of the bearing part, the scoops place a bag (13) over product (8). The lower scoop has a supporting surface (30) which, at least during the infeed of a product is inclined downwardly. A horizontal conveyance surface of discharge means (15) extends to just below the lower scoop. The device comprises a tilting unit in order to turn the scoops in such a way that the supporting surface assumes a horizontal position while a bag is being placed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for packaging products, 
in particular bread, in bags, at least comprising 
feed and discharge means for the products, the feed means 
conveying the products at a level above the discharge 
means, a bearing guide extending essentially at right 
angles to the direction of conveyance of the products, for 
guiding a bearing part which can be driven in a reciprocating 
movement by a rotary drive motor by means of a main 
linkage assembly and bears a lower and an upper scoop, 
which scoops can be moved relative to each other during and 
as a result of the movement of the bearing part, the device 
being able to place a bag over a product to be packaged by 
means of the scoops mounted on the bearing part, while the 
product is retained by blockade means, and the lower scoop 
having a supporting surface which, at least during the 
infeed of a product to be packaged on the supporting surface, 
is inclined downwardly, viewed in the direction of 
conveyance of said product. The bags which are used for packaging the products can 
be conventional bags which are open at one side, but it is 
also possible to use sleeves which are open at two sides 
and are cut from, for example, a hose-type material, the 
ends of which sleeves can be closed at a suitable moment. Such a device for packaging products such as, for 
example, bread, is known from US-A-3,451,192. In the case 
of the device described therein the lower and the upper 
scoop move into a bag which is being held open. Through the 
scoops moving apart the bag is stretched around front sides 
of the scoops. At the same time, the product to be packaged 
is placed by the feed mechanism on the part of the supporting 
surface of the lower scoop situated at the rear side. 
The supporting surface of the lower scoop in this case lies 
in the crosswise direction at an angle of 15Â° with the 
horizontal. The bag is pulled over the product to be packaged 
by moving back the bearing part, while a separate  
 
blockade part retains the product, and the packaged product 
falls onto a bottom plate which, like the scoops, is disposed 
in an inclined position. When the scoops are moved 
fully out of the bag, a pusher mechanism moves the packaged 
product from the inclined bottom plate onto the discharge 
means. This had the disadvantage that a separate pusher 
mechanism is necessary for placing the packaged product on 
the discharge means. Problems also occur in the packaging 
of sliced bread when the lower scoop is being withdrawn 
from under the

<CLAIMS>
Device for packaging products, in particular bread, in 
bags, at least comprising feed and discharge means (26, 15) 

for the products (8), the feed means (26) conveying the 
products at a level above the discharge means (15), a 

bearing guide (1) extending essentially at right angles to 
the direction of conveyance of the products, for guiding a 

bearing part (2) which can be driven in a reciprocating 
movement by a rotary drive motor by means of a main linkage 

assembly (3, 5) and bears a lower and an upper scoop (7, 
9), which scoops can be moved relative to each other during 

and as a result of the movement of the bearing part, the 
device being able to place a bag (13) over a product to be 

packaged by means of the scoops mounted on the bearing part 
while the product is retained by blockade means (14), and 

the lower scoop (7) having a supporting surface (30) which, 
at least during the infeed of a product to be packaged on 

the supporting surface, is inclined downwardly, viewed in 
the direction of conveyance of said product, 
characterised 
in that
 the discharge means (15) comprise an essentially 
horizontal conveyance face extending to just below the 

lower scoop (7), the two scoops (7, 9) are hingedly connected 
to the bearing part (2), and the device is provided 

with a tilting unit which is designed to turn the two 
scoops (7, 9) in such a way that the supporting surface 

(30) is in a horizontal position when a bag has been placed 
over the product and the scoops (7, 9) move out of the bag 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
feed and discharge means (15, 26) each can be placed at 

either side of the device with the result that the direction 
of conveyance can be reversed, and the tilting unit is 

adjustable, so that in the case of both directions of 
conveyance said unit can turn the supporting surface (30) 

into a horizontal position during the placing of a bag over  
 

the product to be packaged. 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that
 a hinge pin (27) is fixed to the bearing part (2), and 
provision is made for an auxiliary linkage assembly (18, 

19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25) which at one side is operated 
by a cam disc (16) coupled to the drive motor and at the 

other side acts upon the scoops (7, 9) in order to bring 
about their tilting movement, the rods (22, 23, 24) of the 

auxiliary linkage assembly running parallel to the rods (3, 
5) of the main linkage assembly and being connected thereto 

by means of transverse arms (19, 20, 21) in such a way that 
a hinged parallelogram construction is formed. 
Device according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in 
that
 the bearing part (2) has fixed to it, next to each 
other, two antisymmetrically formed hinge pin guides of a 

first type, lying essentially horizontal and at right 
angles to the direction of conveyance, and the scoops have 

fixed to them two likewise antisymmetrically formed hinge 
pin guides of a second type, a hinge pin (27) hingedly 

coupling one of the hinge pin guides of the first type to 
the corresponding hinge pin guide of the second type, and 

the tilting unit acting upon a point of the scoops situated 

essentially in the mid-perpendicular plane of the two hinge 
pin guides of the first type.
