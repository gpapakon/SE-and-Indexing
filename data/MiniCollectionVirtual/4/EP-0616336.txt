<ABSTRACT>
The replacement is carried out from an operating region located above the convex face (1a) of the head. The adaptor to be replaced is machined after removing its control mechanism (13) and a heat sleeve (4), by introducing suitable tooling (14) via the upper end of the adaptor (3') to be replaced. In succession, the lower part of the adaptor and a part of the weld of this adaptor are machined, a narrow chamfer is machined in the weld of the adaptor to be replaced, the remaining part of the adaptor (3') to be replaced is rebored inside the head (1), the adaptor is extracted, a replacement adaptor is fitted by cold binding (shrinking) and the replacement adaptor is welded.

Process for replacing an adaptor (3) passing through the cover (1) of the 
vessel of a nuclear reactor having a cambered shape and positioned, after 

dismantling, in such a way as to have an upwardly directed, convex, outer 
surface (1a) and a downwardly directed, inner, concave surface (1b), each of 

the adaptors (3) having a vertical positioning and being fixed in a passage 
opening (2) of the cover (1) by a weld (5) in the vicinity of the inner, 

concave face (1b) and carrying an equipment (13, 4) resting on one end of the 
adaptor (3, 3') projecting to the exterior of the cover (1), the process consisting 

of machining a lower portion of the adaptor (3') to be replaced, in 
the vicinity of the inner surface (1b) of the cover (1) and at least one portion 

of the weld (5) for fixing the adaptor (3), extracting the adaptor (3') 
to be replaced from the opening (2) of the cover (1), introducing and fixing 

the replacement adaptor (50) in the opening and welding the replacement 
adaptor (50) on the cover, characterized in that replacement takes place from 

an intervention zone positioned above the convex face (1a) of the cover and at 
least one of the machining operations of the adaptor (3') to be replaced 

takes place following the dismantling of the equipment (4, 13) resting on its 
upper end and/or welding the replacement adaptor (50), by introducing an 

intervention means (14) through the upper end of the replaced adaptor (3') or 
the replacement adaptor (50). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the equipment resting 
on the upper portion (3a) of the adaptor (3') to be replaced is constituted by 

a control mechanism (13) of a reactivity checking means and by a thermal 
sleeve (4) located within the adaptor (3'). 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that, for putting into 
place the intervention means (14) in the adaptor (3') to be replaced, dismantling 

takes place of at least one control mechanism (13) resting on an adaptor 
(3) differing from the adaptor (3'), which is being replaced. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
fitting takes place of part of the intervention means (14) from below the 

cover in manual manner, via the interior of a biological protection enclosure 
(11). 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that  
 

the elimination by machining of the lower portion of the adaptor (3') to be 
replaced and part of the weld (5) takes place by means of a boring tool (40). 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a 
narrow chamfer (36) is machined in the metal of the weld (5), following the 

elimination by machining of the lower portion of the adaptor (3') to be 
replaced and a portion of the weld (5). 
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that a weld is produced by 
depositing filler metal in the narrow chamfer (36) using a welding head (49, 

59) rotated at variable speed during welding. 
Process according to any one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
following the elimination by machining of the lower portion of the adaptor 

(3') and a portion of the weld (5) of the adaptor to be replaced, reboring 
takes place to the portion of the adaptor (3') remaining within the opening 

(2) of the cover. 
Process according to claim 8, characterized in that after reboring the 
residual portion of the adaptor (3), a compression takes place to a residual 

wall (47) of the adaptor (3) obtained after reboring, so as to separate the 
wall (47) from the passage opening (2) of the cover (1). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that: 

the cover (1) is placed on a repair stand (6) with its outer, convex surface 
(la) directed upwards, 
the equipment (4, 13) resting on the upper portion of the adaptor (3') 
being replaced is dismantled, 
on the upper portion of the adaptor (3') is placed the intervention means 
(14), whereof at least one part is introduced into the bore of the adaptor 

(3'), 
a first machining tool (40) is fixed on the part of the intervention means 
(14) introduced into the adaptor (3') from th
e bottom of the cover (1), 
by machining a lower portion of the adaptor (3') and a portion of the weld 
(5) is eliminated, 
the first machining tool (40) is replaced by a second tool (35) and a  
 

welding chamfer (36) is machined in a residual portion of the weld (5), 
the second machining tool is replaced by a third tool (44) and reboring 
takes place to the portion of the adaptor (3') remaining in the opening (2) 

of the vessel cover (1), 
the rebored portion of the adaptor (3') remaining in the opening (2) of the 
cover (1) is compressed and the remaining portion of the adaptor (3, 3') 

is extracted from the opening (2) of the cover (1), 
the replacement adaptor (50) is put into place at low temperature and 
hooped in the opening (2) and 
the welding chamfer (36) is filled with filler metal. 
Apparatus for performing the process according to any one of the claims 
1 to 10, characterized in that the intervention means (14) has a casing (17) 

provided with means (19) for fixing and centring in the upper portion of the 
adaptor (3, 3'),

(17) and having an external diameter smaller than the diameter of the bore of 

the adaptor (3, 3'), 
means (23, 25, 27, 31) for the displacement of the tubular column (18) in 
translation along its axis and in rotation about its axis, located in the 

casing (17),
