<ABSTRACT>
An angle trisecting device with a base section (12) 
having two angle indicating scales (16, 18) and an 

elongated member (14) with a straight edge portion (28). 
The elongated member (14) is pivotally mounted on the base 

section (12). A given angle on one angle indicating scale 
(16) coinciding with the straight edge portion (28) 

corresponds to a trisected angle on the other angle 
indicating scale (18) coinciding with the straight edge 

portion (28). Pivot pins (32, 36) extend from the elongated 
member (14) and are removably captured in respective base 

slots (24, 26) to ensure reliable operation. In another 
embodiment a guide wall (56) extends from the base to 

ensure reliable operation. An optional link arm (76) is 
pivotally mounted to the base section and with one end 

pivotally mounted to the elongated member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to geometric 
instrument apparatus particularly suitable for 
trisecting or triplicating any given angle. Attempting to trisect an angle using an 
unmarked ruler and compass has been a long-standing 
problem of considerable interest. Reference may be 
made to the text of C. Stanley Ogilvy, "Excursions In 
Geometry", pages 135-141, wherein this is referred to 
as one of "The Unsolved Problems Of Antiquity"; and to 
the text of Leslie Miller, "College Geometry", pages 
193-197, wherein this is referred to as "Impossible 
Ruler and Compass Constructions". It is possible, however, to provide geometric 
instruments that will trisect angles. In my prior U.S. 
Patent No. 3,224,097 there is illustrated a geometric 
instrument which can be used for providing an 
indication of an angle which is one-third of a given 
angle, i.e. trisected, or in the alternative for 
providing an indication of an angle which is three 
times a given angle, i.e. triplicated. In my aforementioned patented geometric 
instrument, there is provided a base with three 
pivotally connected members on the base. In 
particular, there is included a base having a slot 
extending in a straight path. A guide member has one 
end secured within the slot and is adapted for 
rotational and longitudinal movement there along. The 
guide member has an elongated slot extending inwardly 
from its outer free end toward a point of sliding 
connection with the base member slot. A pair of equal 
length link members each have one end pivotally 
connected to the base member at a common point for  
 
pivoting relative thereto. One of the link members is 
pivotally connected to the guide member at a point on 
the guide member inwardly of the slot and spaced from 
the point of pivotal connection to the guide member 
within the slot by a distance which corresponds to the 
length of the first link to the guide member. The second link member has its outer end 
connected for slidable movement within the slot of the 
guide member. An angle indicating scale extends 
outwardly from the end of each of the link members for 
indicating the instantaneous angular position thereof 
relative to a reference line extending through the 
length of the slot in the base member and the point of 
pivotal connection of the links. Accordingly, with 
rotation of the links, one end of one link slides 
within the slotted portion of a guide means and 
simultaneously the slidable connection of the guide 
means moves within the slot. The pointer associated 
with one link
