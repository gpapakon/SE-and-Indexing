<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel 2-bromo- and 2-nitroxy derivatives of 3-bromo- and 3-dibromo-4-oxo-azetidines, 
to processes for the preparation thereof and to the use 

thereof. 
 
According to the invention 2-bromo- and 2-nitroxy derivatives of 3-bromo- and 3-dibromo-4-oxo-azetidines 

are prepared by reacting derivatives of protected penicillanic 
acid 1,1-dioxides with DBN reactant (1,5-diazabicyclo/3.4.0/non-5-ene) and 

then the obtained DBN salt of sulfinic acid or isolated sulfinic acid is treated with 
thionyl chloride and, after eliminating thionyl chloride by evaporation, the obtained 

residue is passed through a silica gel column with methylene chloride or some other 
solvent as eluant or the obtained residue is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran or some 

other suitable solvent and treated with tetrabutyl ammonium bromide and after the 
treatment a derivative of 2-bromo, 3-bromo or 2-bromo-3,3-dibromo-4-oxo-azetidine 

is isolated, which derivative may be subjected to a reaction with silver nitrate in 
2-propanol and, after the treatment of the reaction mixture, derivatives of 2-nitroxy-, 

3-bromo- or 2-nitroxy-3,3-dibromo-4-oxo-azetidine are isolated. 
The obtained substances are useful intermediates in the syntheses of beta lactam 
analogons or as components in formulations having antibacterial, inhibitory, anti-tumour 

or antagonistic action.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to 2-bromo- and 2-nitroxy derivatives of 3-bromo- and 3,3-dibromo-4-oxo-azetidines,
to processes for the preparation thereof and to the use
thereof.There are known certain 2-chloro derivatives of 3-phthalimido-alpha-(1-methylethylidene)-4-oxo-1-azetidine
acetic acid, which are prepared by reacting methyl-6-phthalimido
penicillanate with chlorine or sulfuryl chloride (Kukolja S., J. Am.
Chem. Soc. 93, (1971), 6267).Haloazetidinones are also prepared by reacting penicillin with halogenating agents
such as molecular chlorine or N-halosuccinimide (US 4,159,984). Further, there is
disclosed the rearrangement of oxoazetidine sulfinic acids obtained from penicillin
sulfoxide, with halogenating agents into haloazetidinones (Spitzer W. A., Kukolja S.,
Goodson T., Lammert J. P., Steven R., Lilly Eli Co., EP 60 120, equivalent US
4,368,156; Spitzer W. A, Goodson T., Lammert S. R. and Kukolja S. J., Org. Chem.
46, (1981) 3569). Narisada et al. disclosed the synthesis of chloroazetidinone from
methylthioazelidinones obtained from penicillin (US 4,138,486).S. Kukolja and S. R. Lammert further disclosed the preparation of the above-mentioned
2-chloro derivatives starting from trichloroethyl ester of 6-phenylacetamido-penicillanate
(Croat. Chem. Acta 44, (1972) 299-301). The Eli Lilly Company
claimed the preparation of haloazetidinones starting from 3-exomethylene
cephalosporin sulfone with the acylamide group in the 7-position and reacting the 
same with activated zinc or magnesium and ammonium chloride to
obtain sulfinic acids, which acids with halogenating agents
give sulfinyl chlorides, which are then subjected to hydrolysis
(EP 132395).3-bromo- and 3,3-dibromo-2-chloroazetidinones are also prepared
by the reaction of pivaloyloxymethyl 6-bromo- or 6,6-dibromopenicillanate
with chlorine or tertiary butyl hypochlorite
(C. Somoza and O.A. Oreste, Tetrahedron 44, (1988) 7007-12.).According to our knowledge 2-bromo- and 2-nitroxy derivatives
of 3-bromo- and 3,3-dibromo-4-oxo-azetidines are not known.A subject matter of the present invention are 2-bromo- and 2-nitroxy
derivatives of 3-bromo- and 3,3-dibromo-4-oxo-azetidines
of the general formula I

wherein
R1 is hydrogen or bromine,R2 is hydrogen or bromine,R3 is

wherein R4 is hydrogen, methyl, benzyl

provided that at least one of R1 and R2 is bromine. A further subject matter of the present invention is a
process for preparing 2-bromo- and 2-nitroxy derivatives of
