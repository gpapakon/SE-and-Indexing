<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
reinforcing concrete columns to increase their ability 
to withstand asymmetric loading. More particularly, the 
present invention involves reinforcing the exterior 
surface of the concrete column to increase the ability 
of the concrete column to withstand asymmetric loading 
during earthquakes. Concrete columns are widely used as support 
structures. Bridge supports, freeway overpass supports, 
building structural supports and parking structure 
supports are just a few of the many uses for concrete 
columns. Concrete columns exist in a wide variety of 
shapes. Concrete columns with circular, square and 
rectangular cross-sections are most common. However, 
numerous other cross-sectional shapes have been used 
including regular polygonal shapes and irregular 
cross-sections. The size of concrete columns also 
varies greatly depending upon the intended use. 
Concrete columns with diameters on the order of 2 to 20 
feet (610-6100 mm) and lengths of well over 50 feet (15240 mm) are commonly used 
as bridge or overpass supports. It is common practice to reinforce concrete columns 
with metal rods or bars. The metal reinforcement 
provides a great deal of added structural strength to 
the concrete column. Although metal reinforcement of 
concrete columns provides adequate structural 
reinforcement under most circumstances, there have been 
numerous incidents of structural failure of 
metal-reinforced concrete columns when subjected to 
asymmetric loads generated, during earthquakes. The 
structural failure of a metal reinforced concrete  
 
support column during an earthquake can have disastrous 
consequences. Accordingly, there is a continuing need 
to enhance the ability of concrete columns to withstand 
the asymmetric loads which are applied to the column 
during an earthquake. One way of increasing the structural integrity of 
concrete columns is to include additional metal 
reinforcement prior to pouring the concrete column. 
Other design features may be incorporated into the 
concrete column fabrication in order to increase its 
resistance to asymmetric loading. However, there are 
hundreds of thousands of existing concrete supports 
located in earthquake prone areas which do not have 
adequate metal reinforcement or structural design to 
withstand high degrees of asymmetric loading. 
Accordingly, there is a need to provide a simple, 
efficient and relatively inexpensive system for 
reinforcing such existing concrete columns to prevent or 
reduce the
