<ABSTRACT>
Method of using an indicator having a moving pointer (1) driven in front of a dial (2) by a motor controlled in microsteps (10) as a function of a signal (4) to be displayed, in which:   . the signal (4) to be displayed is firstly adjusted so that the pointer (1) is flush with the limit stop (20) and the corresponding position in the step is then memorized, and then . the pointer (1) is brought back, by microsteps in successive steps, towards the limit stop (20), jumping, in each step, the positions which lie within the range of the step and for which the difference between the positions of the microsteps and that of the limit stop (20) is greater than a half-step.   Application to revolution counters.
