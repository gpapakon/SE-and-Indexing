<ABSTRACT>
A metal detector equipped with a matrix sensor (20) and a 
signal processing system (170) for driving this matrix sensor. The 

matrix sensor includes a plurality of transmission lines (22) and a 
plurality of reception lines (29) disposed in row and column, and 

a substrate (17) for supporting these lines. Either of the transmission 
line and reception line is constituted of a pair of parallel 

conductors (62) forming going and returning paths. The pair of 
conductor lines are interconnected at one end, and the open ends 

function as signal input/output terminals. The substrate includes 
a transmission terminal portion (23) and a reception terminal portion 

(27) for external connection, a region where the transmission 
lines and the reception lines are wired, a transmission line extension 

wiring (64) for connecting the input/output terminal to the 
transmission terminal portion and a reception line extension wiring 

for connecting the input/output terminal of the reception line 
to the reception terminal portion. At least one of the extension 

wiring for transmission and the extension wiring for reception is 
individually disposed for only either one of the input/output 

terminals of each pair of conductor lines for going and returning, 

and the other is disposed as a common wiring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sensor, and a metal body 
detecting apparatus employing the sensor for detecting the 
position of a metal body and a sensing matrix assembly, and more 
particularly to a sensing matrix assembly formed of a plurality of 
transmission lines and a plurality of reception lines so as to 
arrange detecting points in a matrix, and a metal body detecting 
apparatus for detecting the presence of a metal body and the 
location thereof by employing the sensing matrix. In some cases it is necessary to detect the location of a metal 
body in a predetermined region, especially within a plane region. 
By way of an example of such cases, the movement course of a 
metal body in the plane region may be detected. In other cases, 
when metal bodies are distributed within a region, a distribution 
pattern of the metal bodies may be detected. As an example of the 
former cases, the movement course of a game playing medium in 
a game machine may be detected.  Some of the game machines are such that a metal body, for 
example, a metal ball, is moved within a specified space which has 
been provided in the game machine, and that the prize is 
determined according to the reached position of the ball. A typical 
example of such a game machine is a pachinko game machine with 
which a game player lets a metal pachinko ball move and fall 
down within a space with many obstacles, the space being formed 
between parallel planes. In general, the pachinko game machine has a panel which 
defines the space within which the pachinko ball moves, a glass 
plate which covers the panel at a fixed interval therefrom, and a 
projectile mechanism which projects pachinko balls into the space 
formed between the panel and the glass plate. The pachinko game 
machine is installed in such a manner that the panel may be 
substantially in parallel to the vertical direction. The panel is 
provided with a plurality of winning holes, and a discharge hole. 
When the pachinko ball enters the winning hole, that is a win for 
the player, while all the pachinko balls which fail to enter the 
winning holes are finally gathered to be discharged from the 
discharge hole. Besides, a number of pins (nails) having a length almost 
equal to the diameter of pachinko balls, are provided at the panel, 
projecting therefrom and substantially perpendicular to the panel, 
so that the projected pachinko balls may frequently collide against 
the pins when falling along the panel to have their moving 
direction altered. The distribution of
