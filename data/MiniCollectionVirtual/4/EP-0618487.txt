<ABSTRACT>
The present invention describes slot inserts for 
use in a coating hopper having at least one metering 

slot. The slot inserts allow widthwise adjustment of the 
coating width. The slot inserts push fit into the 

metering slot and are held by friction between the walls 
of the metering slot. In one aspect of the invention, 

the inserts have different widthwise dimensions at each 
end allowing control over the edges. For dual cavity 

hoppers, the slot inserts can be shaped so as to prevent 
stagnant regions within the hopper cavities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to coating a moving
web with one or more layers of a liquid material. More
particularly, the present invention concerns inserts for
coating hoppers, which allows for quick changeover from
one coating operation to another coating operation.Multiple slot coating hoppers are known in the
art, first being described in the patents of TA Russell
(2,761,791 2,761,417). Shown in these patents are
hoppers which contain multiple precision metering slots,
formed between adjoining plates, for the purpose of
simultaneously delivering multiple layers of fluid in
large widths, while maintaining uniform thickness of
those layers across their width.More recent art, British Patent 1,389,074 has
disclosed that within the coating hopper there may be
more than one distribution channel, or cavity, and more
than one metering slot used to evenly distribute each
fluid layer.In manufacturing photosensitive products many
demands may be placed upon the coating hopper. It is
very important that the coating hopper be able to coat
many different photographic products. This demands that
it be easy, quick, simple, and efficient to changeover
from coating one product to coating the next.
Additionally, in coating many different products it is
important that it be simple to change the width of the
metering slots, and hence the coating, to meet the
coating width needs of each product. Moreover, it is 
important that the hopper meet all these demands while
maintaining a high level of quality in the coatings.
Specifically this means that the width wise uniformity of
the small metering slot be maintained. Also this means
that it must be possible and easy to clean the entire
hopper between products including removing any dirt or
particles from the interior spaces of the hopper. These
last considerations are important to prevent any
contamination between the coating fluids of successive
products and to prevent any defects in the coating.There are several pieces of prior art which
provide partial solutions to these multiple needs. U.S.
Patent 1,643,643 shows a mechanism installed in the head
box slot of a paper mill machine. Although this
mechanism provides the ability to adjust the width of the
metering slot, it does not provide the ability to fully
clean the interior of the hopper without disassembly.
There are stagnant spaces behind this mechanism, and it
would require taking the hopper apart to fully clean the
interior. This does not meet the demand of product
changeover efficiency as described
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for use in a coating hopper (50)
having a plurality of elongated metering slots (52; 62)

formed by a parallel wall through which coating composition
issues, each of said slots being in fluid communication

with at least one distribution cavity (51; 61) with some
outermost portion of each of said slots blocked by an

insert (5), said insert (5) being held by friction
characterized in that:


said insert (5) is designed so that some portion
of the insert (5) projects beyond said metering slot (52;

62) exit while substantially occupying at least the
outermost portion of said metering slot (52; 62) between

said slot exit and said outermost distribution cavity (51;
61); and
said insert (5) having a thickness between about
90% to 99% of the distance between said parallel walls of

said metering slot (52; 62).
The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein flow is substantially blocked at least in
said outermost portion of said metering slot (52; 62) from said outermost distribution

cavity (51; 61) to said slot exit by said insert (5) and wherein said insert (5) is
removable without disassembly of said hopper.
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein each of said slots is in fluid
communication with a plurality of distribution cavities (61, 64) , the cavities (61, 64)

being in communication through a communication slot (66) ; and wherein said inserts
(5) extend beyond the outermost portion of said metering slot (62) and partially or

fully into some or all communication slot (66).
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said inserts (5) are made of a material
softer than that of said slot walls.
The apparatus according to claim 4 wherein said material is plastic.
The apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the width of said insert (5) is variable
along said length of said insert (5).
