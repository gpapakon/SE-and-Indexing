<ABSTRACT>
An auxiliary video information decoder for decoding information such as closed caption data in a video signal identifies a desired horizontal line of video in a video signal. A reference pulse in a synchronizing signal is detected followed by the generation of first and second window pulse signals occurring at predetermined delays after detection of the reference pulse. A pulse occurring in the synchronizing signal during the window pulses indicates the start of the desired horizontal line interval. A field identification signal may also be generated. Features for improving noise and phase error immunity when identifying a video line are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detection of information
that may be present in a video signal during vertical blanking
intervals. A video signal typically includes vertical display
intervals, or fields, having a plurality of horizontal line intervals,
e.g. 262.5 lines per field in NTSC video systems. The beginning of
each vertical and horizontal interval is identified by respective
vertical and horizontal sync pulses that are included in a
composite video signal. During a portion of each vertical interval,
information in the video signal may not be intended for display.
For example, a vertical blanking interval spans approximately the
first 20 horizontal line intervals in each field. In addition, several
line intervals adjacent to the vertical blanking period, e.g. line 21,
may be within an overscan region of a video display and will not
be visible.The lack of displayed image information during blanking
and overscan intervals makes it possible to insert an auxiliary
information component, e.g. teletext or closed caption data, into
these intervals. Standards such as Federal Communications
Commissions (FCC) Regulations define the format for each type of
auxiliary information including the positioning of the information
within a vertical interval. For example, the present closed
captioning standard (see e.g. 47 CFR §§ 15.119 and 73.682)
specifies that digital data corresponding to ASCII characters for
closed captioning must be in line 21 of field 1. Future
modifications to the standard may permit auxiliary information
such as closed caption data to be located in other lines, e.g. line 21
of every field.Auxiliary video information is extracted from the video
signal using a decoder. Acceptable performance of the decoder
requires reliable identification of the particular lines and fields of
the video signal that include auxiliary video data. Examples of
approaches to identifying particular video line intervals are
disclosed in JP-A-57 052 280, US-A-4 172 262, JP-A-60 229 590 and EDN vol. 35, no.4, 15. February 1990, Newton (US), p. 185. If video 
signal strength decreases (e.g. caused by poor reception), the
probability of errors in the decoder output increases. For
example, detection of synchronizing events in a video signal, such
as vertical sync pulses, may provide a timing reference point for
identifying video lines (e.g. line 21) that may contain auxiliary
video information. However, a decrease in video signal strength
causes a corresponding decrease in sync signal amplitude.

Apparatus including:

first detecting means (136, 138) for detecting
a first pulse included in a synchronization component

(CSYNC) of a video signal for indicating the beginning

the synchronization component having vertical
synchronization pulses and horizontal synchronization

pulses;
a counter (104) responsive to a clock signal

enable interval a second pulse included in said

second counter (136) for counting cycles of a second
clock signal (128-FH) at a frequency substantially greater
