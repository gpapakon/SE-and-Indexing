<ABSTRACT>
A stent is made flexible along its length. The stent initially starts as a
metal sheet. It is rolled in its central region to a specified wall thickness.

Thereafter, the stent is photochemically etched to produce the desired cell
pattern of the design of the stent. Then, the stent is folded and the metal is

joined to give rise to a stent with multiple wall thickness. For instance, larger
wall thicknesses at the end of the stent versus smaller wall thicknesses at its

center. Various other possible manufacturing methods are useful with respect
to this stent. The stent can also be produced in an initial tube shape. The tube

can be etched several times to get varying wall thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stents. In general, this invention relates to
stents made more flexible, based on their overall structure; specifically, this
invention relates to varying the wall thickness of a stent in order to create a
more flexible stent; and also to improve radioopacity and alter other
performance characteristics, such as radial strength, distension forces, etc. of
the stent while not effecting its flexibility.A stent is commonly used as a tubular structure left inside the lumen of
a vessel or duct of the body, in order to relieve an obstruction in the lumen or
duct. Commonly, stents are inserted into the lumen in their unexpanded form;
the stents are then expanded on their own (or with the aid of a second device)
in situ at the obstruction. A typical method of expansion occurs through the
use of a catheter-mounted stent on an angioplasty balloon, which balloon is
inflated within the stenosed vessel or body passageway. This inflation causes
the obstructions of the vessel associated with the wall components of the
vessel to compress. Thereafter, the stent holds the obstruction in place at the
vessel wall, and an enlarged lumen is obtained.It is fairly commonly believed that usage of a stents is a technology
transforming the type of therapy used against stenosis of a lumen. That is, in
the absence of a using a stent, (in other words, when a balloon used alone)
restenosis often occurs, as a result of elastic recoil of the stenotic lesion away 
from the vessel wall. So, stents have been hailed as a breakthrough in the use
of science to improve medicinal therapies.Although a number of stent designs have been created, the designs of
these stents have exhibited a number of limitations, such as a general
restriction on the dimension of the stent. For instance, typical stents have
been limited to a pair of generally rigid ends (approx. 8mm) and a flexible
middle section (anywhere from about 7mm to about 21mm). This device is
formed of multiple parts and is not continuously flexible along the longitudinal
axis. Other stent designs with rigid segments and flexible segments have also
been described.Other stents are described as longitudinally flexible, but consist of a
plurality of cylindrical elements connected by flexible members. This design
has at least one important disadvantage, for example, according to this design,
protruding edges occur when the stent is flexed around a curve raising the
possibility of inadvertent retention of the stent on plaque deposited on arterial
walls. This may cause

<CLAIMS>
A stent (10) comprising:

a generally tubular device with a diameter and a length having a pattern of
interconnected struts (3), said struts having a cross-sectional width and thickness (T;T');

and
said strut thickness being variable along the length of said stent;

   
characterised in that
 the struts comprise longitudinally disposed curvilinear struts
(3), said strut thickness (T;T') being variable along the length of said struts.
The stent of claim 1, wherein the variable strut thickness is varied along the length
of the strut (3) so that said strut is thicker (1) at its ends than in the middle (T').
The stent of claim 1, wherein said struts (3) are configured so that there are portions
of relative thickness (T) and relative thinness (T') along the length of the stent (10), and

said portions of relative thickness are interspersed between said portions of relative
thinness.
The stent of claim 1, wherein the variable strut thickness is varied along the length
of the strut (3) so that said strut is relatively thicker at one of its ends than at the other.

longitudinally disposed curvilinear struts

(3) have a waveform (W)
said stent (10) has first and second end regions with an

intermediate section between the two, the spacial frequency(L
A
) of the waveform (W) in at least one of the end
regions being decreased compared with that (L
B
) in the intermediate section. 
The stent of claim 5, wherein the spacial frequency (L
A

region is decreased by 20% compared to the spacial frequency (L
B
) in the intermediate
section.
The stent of claim 5 or claim 6, wherein the struts (3) have a cross-sectional width
and thickness, the width (A) being greater in the end regions than the width (B) in the

intermediate section.
The stent of any preceding claim, wherein said struts (3) are cut from said tubular
device.
The stent of any preceding claim wherein said struts (3) are generally parallel, and
are connected to one another by circumferential links (7,8).
