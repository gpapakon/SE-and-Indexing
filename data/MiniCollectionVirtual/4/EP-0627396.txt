cyclohexene diol derivatives and optically active cyclohexenone 

derivatives, and a process for production of 
these compounds in which a special cyclohexene diol of a 

starting material is reacted by selectively positioning 
transesterification in the presence of lipase to obtain 

an optically active cyclohexene diol derivative and then 
an optically active cyclohexenone derivative represented 

by the following formula:

cyclohexene diol derivatives and optically active cyclohexenone 

derivatives, which are intermediates for synthesizing 
physiologically active materials, can be obtained 

efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the following optically 
active cyclohexene diol derivatives (1) and (1'), 
and optically active cyclohexenone derivatives (2) and 
(2'), and a process for production of these compounds. The optically active cyclohexene diol derivatives 
represented by the following formula (1) and (1'), and 
the optically active cyclohexenone derivatives represented 
by the following formula (2) and (2') are useful as 
intermediates for synthesizing physiologically active 
compounds. The optically active cyclohexenone derivatives represented 
by the formula (2), for example, can be used to 
obtain occidol (8) of a sesquiterpene through six steps 
as shown in the following. 
Further, the optically active cyclohexene diol derivative 
represented by the formula (1) can be an intermediate 
for synthesizing compactin (19) which is a hyperlipemia 
therapeutic drug (HMG CoA reductase synthesis inhibitor) 
as shown in the following. 
Though the compounds are useful as described above, 
these have not been prepared by an efficient process. As an example, optically active 5-trimethylsilyl  
 
cyclohex-2-enone equivalent to the compounds of the 
present invention has been obtained by a method comprising 
reacting the racemate with cinchonidine of an alkaloid 
and toluenethiol and repeatedly recrystallizing the 
resulting diastereomer salt. However, the method comprises 
several steps and the yield is too low (3%) so 
that such a production process is not efficient (Tetrahedron 
Lett., 28, 5669 (1987). Considering these problems, the inventors of the 
present invention earnestly studied to efficiently 
obtain pure optically active cyclohexenone derivatives 
useful as intermediates for synthesis of physiologically 
active materials. Then, they have found the optically 
active cyclohexene diols represented by the following 
formulas (1) and (1'), and the optically active cyclohexenone 
derivatives represented by the following formulas 
(2) and (2'), and the process for efficiently producing 
these compounds. The present invention is characterized in that a 
cyclohexene diol represented by the formula: 
 
is used as a starting material to react with an acylating 
agent in the presence of lipase by selectively positioning 
transesterification, and an optically active cyclohexene 
diol derivative represented by the formula:  
 
 
wherein R1 is alkyl, is obtained from the above reaction, 
and then an optically active cyclohexenone derivative 
represented by the formula: 
 
is obtained. The scope of the
