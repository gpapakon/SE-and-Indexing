<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for producing a vacuum within insulating glazing made up of two sheets of glass (2, 3) separated by studs (4). According to the invention, one of the sheets of glass has a hole (12) which is plugged by a melted ball (8) once the vacuum has been produced. The invention also relates to insulating glazing in which the sheets of glass are separated by studs (4) and joined round their periphery by means of a sealing joint.

Method for producing a vacuum between two glass sheets (2, 3)

constituting an insulating glazing (1), one of said glass sheets having a
hole (12) made through its thickness, 
characterized in that
 a ball (8) is
placed at the outer end (7) of the hole, 
in that
 the vacuum is formed and 
in
that
 the ball (8) is softened in order to seal it onto the glass sheet so as
to block said hole (12).
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the diameter of the
hole is between 1 and 3 millimetres.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the ball (8) is
made from a material having a softening point lower than that of the glass

sheet and preferably between 380 and 450Â°C.
Method according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the expansion
coefficient of the material constituting the ball (8) is close to that of the

glass sheet.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that

the temperature of the glass sheet is raised to the softening point of the
ball (8) simultaneously with the softening of the latter.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that

the outer end (7) of the hole (12) is milled.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that

the ball (8) is softened by placing an electrical resistor above the glazing.
Vacuum insulating glazing obtainable according to one of the claims 1 to
7, 
characterized in that
 it has on one of its faces a zone constituted by a
material having a softening point lower than that of the glass sheets.
Insulating glazing (1) according to claim 8, the two glass sheets being
separated from one another by studs (4) distributed over the entire surface

and peripherally joined by a sealing joint (6), 
characterized in that
 the
studs (4) are constituted by at least one sintered solder glass suspension

devitrified during the formation of said studs.
Insulating glazing (1) according to claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the
studs (4) are constituted by a ceramic material such as alumina or silicon

carbide having a high melting point and coated with the sintered solder glass 
suspension.
Insulating glazing (1) according to claim 9 or 10, 
characterized in that

the studs (4) have a diameter below 0.5 millimetres and a thickness between
0.1 and 0.3 millimetres.
Insulating glazing according to one of the claims 9 to 11, 
characterized
in that
 the number of studs (4) per square metre is between 600 and 1500 and
is preferably 1000.
Insulating glazing (1) according to one of the claims 9 to 12,

characterized in that
 the sealing joint (6) is constituted by the sintered
solder glass suspension.
Insulating glazing (1) according to claim 13, 
characterized in that
 the
sintered solder glass suspension forming the sealing joint (6) is

devitrified.
Insulating glazing (1) according to one of the claims 9 to 14,

characterized in that
 the glass sheets (2, 3) have a thickness of 4
millimetres.
Insulating glazing (1) according to one of the claims 9 to 15,

characterized in that
 at least one of the glass sheets (2, 3) is toughened.
Insulating glazing (1) according to one of the claims 9 to 16,

characterized in that
 at least one of the glass sheets (2, 3) has a low
emissive layer (5) on its face in contact with the studs (4).
Insulating glazing (1) according to one of the claims 8 to 17,

characterized in that
 one of the glass sheets (2, 3) has a larger surface
area than the other glass sheet.
