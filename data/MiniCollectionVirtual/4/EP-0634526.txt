<ABSTRACT>
Process for surface treatment of articles to be coated consisting of cement-bound or bituminous or other composite materials, such as roads, airfields, bridge parts and the like, according to which the surface is roughened and cleaned before application of the coating, such that the peak-to-body height corresponds to half the maximum grain diameter (1) of the surfaces (3) to be coated or of the top layer (3) to be coated and the waviness corresponds to the maximum grain diameter (1). This waviness may be uniaxial or else biaxial.

<CLAIMS>
A process for surface treatment of workpieces which are to be 
coated and made of cement-bound or bituminous or other 

composite materials, such as roads, airports, bridge sections 
etc., according to which the surface is roughened and cleaned 

prior to applying the coating, 
characterized in that
 the 
roughening depth (RT) corresponds to half the diameter of the 

largest grain of the surfaces (3) to be coated or the coating 
covering layer (3), and that the waviness (WL) corresponds with 

the diameter of the larger grain. 
A process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
waviness (WL) is two-axial. 
A process according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
waviness (WL) is of a shape as established by monotonous 

rising from the bottom of a trough to the crest of a wave, in 
particularly sinusoidal or triangular.
