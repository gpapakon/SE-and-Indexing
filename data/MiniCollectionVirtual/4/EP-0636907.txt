<ABSTRACT>
Novel mirror materials and fabrication processes are used to produce extremely 

low cost reflective optical components. Reflective mirrors are made using injection 
molded filled plastic. Reinforcing filler materials are added to the plastic resin prior to 

molding. Subsequent to injection molding, the plastic mirrors are coated with aluminum 
or other infrared reflective coating by means of vacuum deposition, for example, 

to produce a reflective surface. Additives or external metallization provide for control 
of thermal conductivity. The mirrors produced in accordance with the present invention 

may be used for 8-12 or 3-5 micron infrared imaging. However, the present plastic 
mirrors, when appropriately coated, may also be used in other wavelength bands. By 

employing the principles of the present invention, low cost mirrors with improved 
thermal stability and optical quality are achieved. The principle advantage of the present 

invention is a dramatic reduction in cost possible over reflective elements manufactured 
using conventional precision optical fabrication methods. The present mirrors have 

improved optical properties, primarily mirror figure and thermal stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to infrared optics, and more particularly, to 
reflective plastic optics employing filled plastic materials. Infrared sensor systems may employ reflective optics, refractive optics, or a 
combination these two optics types. Refractive designs require exotic infrared lens 
materials and are therefore not consistent with producing a low cost sensor. There are 
many materials and methods for fabricating reflective optical components. They are 
commonly made from glass, metals (such as aluminum, steel, or copper, for example), 
beryllium, and glass or ceramics, and the like. Low quality flat mirrors are sometimes 
made out of unreinforced plastic. Using conventional precision optical fabrication 
techniques, mirror fabrication costs are very high and the materials used are also often 
costly. Therefore, using conventional fabrication methods for precision reflective 
optics, the fabrication cost is prohibitive for very low cost systems. Using current 
injection molding techniques is a low cost solution, however, the quality and stability 
are not adequate for many applications. Injection molded plastics are currently used in some optical applications. The 
vast majority of these optics are refractive, operating in visible wavelengths. These 
plastic materials cannot be used for refractive infrared applications because they do not 
transmit in the required wavelength bands. Injection molded plastics are occasionally 
used for reflective purposes, however, after a considerable investigation of plastic 
optics suppliers, reflective infrared optical components have not been found.  While reflective optics have been made from injection molded plastics, the 
current technology strictly employs unreinforced (unfilled) plastic materials. The 
optical components made using these unfilled materials have several drawbacks. The 
major drawbacks in using standard unreinforced plastics are low accuracy in terms of 
mirror figure, and susceptibility to thermal gradients, both of which impact optical 
performance. Therefore, reflective optics produced using the current technology can 
only be used for low-precision applications. The present invention uses novel mirror materials and fabrication processes to 
produce extremely low cost reflective optics that are of very good optical quality. In the 
present invention, reflective mirrors are made using injection molded filled plastic. 
Subsequent to injection molding, the plastic mirrors are coated with aluminum, or other 
infrared reflective
