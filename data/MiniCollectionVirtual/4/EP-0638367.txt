<ABSTRACT>
The dispensing device (D) includes a container (1) provided with a neck (3) equipped with fixing means (F) for a pump (7) installed detachably with the aid of complementary fixing means (F') which are connected to the pump body and are suitable for interacting with the fixing means (F) of the neck (3). The device comprises an open-bottomed casing (16) suitable for covering the container (1), this casing (16) being provided with a neck (17) equipped with rotational locking means (B') suitable for interacting with complementary locking means (B) provided on the base of the neck (3) of the container; the rotational locking means (B', B) come into engagement when the casing (16) is put into place on the container (1), whereas longitudinal-stop means (17) are provided on the casing in order to interact with, on the one hand, bearing means (21) connected with a pump body and, on the other hand, stop means (22) connected with the container (1), so that, when fixing the pump (7) to the neck (3) of the container, the interaction of the longitudinal-stop means (17) with the bearing means (21) and the stop means (22) ensure that the casing (16) is locked longitudinally relative to the container (1).

Dispensing device for a liquid or pasty product,
comprising a container (1) for the product, which has a

neck equipped with fastening means (F) for a pump (7)
installed removably using complementary fastening means

(F') attached to the pump body and capable of interacting
with the fastening means on the neck of the container,

characterized in that it comprises an open-ended cover
(16) which fits over the container (1), this cover (16)

having a neck (17) equipped with means (B') preventing it
from turning which can interact with complementary

turning-prevention means (B) provided at the base of the
neck (3) of the container (1), these turning-prevention

means (B, B') engaging when the cover (16) is put in
place over the container (1), while longitudinal-stop

means (17) are provided on the cover (16) to interact
with, on the one hand, bearing means (21) attached to the

pump body and, on the other hand, stop means (22)
attached to the container, so that when the pump (7) is

fastened onto the neck (3) of the container, the interaction
of the longitudinal-stop means (17) with the

bearing means (21) and the stop means (22) prevents the
longitudinal movement of the cover relative to the

container.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the axial length of the cover (16) exceeds that of

the container (1), so that when the cover is in place
over the container, the unit as a whole, placed on a

horizontal bearing surface (S), rests via the lower end
of the cover (16) while the bottom end (2) of the container

is a small distance away.
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the cover is relatively thick in order to give

the unit as a whole some rigidity, while the container
(1), which is simply a refill, is made with a wall which

is much thinner than that of the cover (16).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the wall of the container (1) has a thickness of the

order of 0.3 mm.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the fastening means (F) of the

container neck (3) consist of an external screw thread
(5) provided at the top of the neck, while the pump body

(10) is secured, especially by screw-fastening or snap-fastening,
to a cap (12) which has an internal skirt (13)

with an internal screw thread (14) capable of interacting
with the external screw thread of the container neck.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the means (B) for preventing the

neck (17) of the cover from turning comprise a system of
ribs (19) (or grooves) parallel to the axis of the cover

(16) and provided on the internal surface of the neck
(17) of the cover, while a system of complementary

grooves (6) (or ribs) is provided at the lower part of
the neck (3) of the container (1), the two systems of

ribs/grooves being made to engage simply by an axial
movement of the cover (16) relative to the container (1)

with the correct angular position.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the longitudinal-stop means of the

cover are formed by the neck (17) of this cover, the
upper end of which butts up against th
e bearing means
(21) attached to the pump body (8).
Device according to Claims 5 and 7, characterized
in that the bearing means are formed by the lower end

(21) of the internal skirt (13) of the cap (12) attached
to the pump.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the stop means (22) provided on the

container are formed by a shoulder (4) where the base of
the neck (3) of the container meets the body of the

container.
