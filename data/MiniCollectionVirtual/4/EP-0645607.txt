<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for deriving signals which are free from harmonics up to a 
predeterminable wavelength, which are generated by sensing a periodic measuring 

graduation (14) with at least one aperiodic sensing graduation (18), wherein the grating 
strokes of the sensing graduation (18) have a grating stroke displacement relative to the 

periodic measuring graduation (14), characterized in that the sequence of grating stroke 
displacements departs from an ordered sequence. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the grating strokes (n) 
have the same width as each other. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the irregular sequence of 
grating stroke displacements is determined by mixing up an ordered sequence. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterized in that the mixing up is effected 
statistically or pseudo-statistically. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the irregular sequence of 
grating stroke displacements is directly prescribed. 
Apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the frequency 
distribution of the grating stroke displacements is of rectangular or cosinusoidal form. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the mean grating stroke 
displacement of an arbitrary partial region of at least ten grating strokes (n) is smaller 

than 1/4 of the mean grating stroke spacing.
