<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bearing device for a blade holder (8) on the driveshaft of a lawnmower. The essential feature of this is that the blade holder mounted rotatably relative to the driveshaft (2) is connected via spring elements (7) to an axially adjustable driving ring (5) which, on the one hand, is pressed against a braking surface (6) by the spring elements and, on the other hand, can shift in an angular direction counter to the spring force when the blade strikes against an obstacle.

<CLAIMS>
Lawn mower having a housing (1) and having a horizontally rotating 
blade holder (8) mounted on a drive shaft (2) and driven by way of a 

releasable coupling, the blade holder (8), which is mounted to be 
rotatable relative to the drive shaft (2), sliding in the event of a collision 

with an obstruction and being connected by way of spring elements (7) 
to an axially displaceab
le drive ring (5) which on the one hand is pressed 
by the spring elements (7) against a braking surface (6) mounted on the 

housing (1) and which on the other hand is arranged to be lifted electro-magnetically 
away from the braking surface (6) and brought into 

operative connection with the drive shaft (2), 
characterised in that
 by 
means of a pendulum bearing (9) the blade holder (8) is able to be 

deflected angularly with respect to the drive shaft (2), and the said 
spring elements (7) are responsible also for the resetting of the blade 

holder (8). 
Lawn mower according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the spring 
elements (7) consist of a plurality of leaf springs arranged approximately 

horizontally in the circumferential direction. 
Lawn mower according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the drive ring 
(5) has lower and upper planar faces which come to bear against corresponding 

planar faces of the braking surface (6) or of a ring (3) connected 
to the drive shaft (2). 
Lawn mower according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 adjacent to 
the ring (3) there is arranged a stationary ring-shaped electromagnet (4) 

which cooperates with the drive disc (5). 
Lawn mower according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the braking 
surface (6) is mounted to be axially displaceable on the housing (1). 
Lawn mower according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the blade 
holder (8) is mounted directly or indirectly on the drive shaft (2) by 

means of a pendulum roller bearing (9). 
Lawn mower according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the angular 
displacement of the blade holder (8) is limited by a stop (11).
