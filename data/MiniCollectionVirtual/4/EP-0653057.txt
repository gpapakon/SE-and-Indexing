<ABSTRACT>
A gas analysis cell having a pressure control system eliminates pressure variations in the gas cell regardless of changes in restriction, gas viscosity and barometric pressure. Since optical alignement through the gas cell is sensitive to gas pressure, maintaining a constant pressure in the gas cell makes the system more stable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of patent 
application Serial No. 07/771,625, filed October 4, 1991, which 
is a continuation-in-part of patent application Serial No. 
07/522,533, filed May 11, 1990, by inventor Scott Miles, and 
entitled "Gas Analysis System Having Buffer Gas Inputs To 
Protect Associated Optical Elements". The invention relates to a gas analysis cell, and, in 
particular, to a gas analysis cell for containing a gas sample 
in a laser Raman gas analysis system. Raman light scattering has been successfully used in 
critical care situations to continuously monitor a patient's 
respiratory gases. This technique is based on the effect 
which occurs when monochromatic light interacts with 
vibrational/rotational modes of gas molecules to produce 
scattered light which is frequency shifted from that of the 
incident radiation by an amount corresponding to the 
vibrational/rotational energies of the scattering gas molecules. 
If the incident light photon loses energy in the collision, it 
is re-emitted as scattered light with lower energy and 
consequently lower frequency than the incident photon. In a 
similar manner, if the incident photon gains energy in the 
collision, it is re-emitted as scattered light with higher 
energy and higher frequency than the incident photon. Since 
these energy shifts are species-specific, analysis of the 
various frequency components present in the Raman scattering 
spectrum of a sample provides chemical identification of the 
gases present in the scattering volume. The intensity of the 
various frequency components or Raman spectral lines provides 
quantification of the gases present, providing suitable 
calibrations have been made. In this manner, Raman light  
 
scattering can be employed to determine the identity and 
quantity of various respiratory and anesthetic gases present in 
a patient's breath in operating room and intensive care 
situations. In addition to critical care situations, Raman light 
scattering gas analysis can also be used in many industrial 
applications such as stack gas analysis for combustion control, 
process control, fermentation monitoring, and pipeline gas 
mixture control. This analysis technique can also be extended 
to meet environmental monitoring needs in many areas such as 
escaped anesthetic agents in the operating room, air pollution, 
auto emissions testing and submarine atmosphere monitoring. Systems developed for analysis of gases in critical care 
situations utilizing Raman scattering typically employ gas
