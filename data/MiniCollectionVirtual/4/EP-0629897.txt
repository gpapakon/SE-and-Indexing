<ABSTRACT>
A film cassette (1) comprises a rotatable film spool 
(9), a light shield (7) for preventing ambient light 

from entering the cassette interior, and a locking pawl 
(11) movable into engagement with the spool (9) to inhibit 

rotation of the spool but being forced out of engagement 
with the spool when the spool is rotated. 

According to the invention, the light shield (7) is 
movable to open and the locking pawl (11) is arranged 

to move the light shield to open responsive to the 
locking pawl being forced out of engagement with the 

spool (9) when the spool is rotated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of 
photography, and in particular to film cassettes. More 
specifically, the invention relates to a film cassette with 
a spool lock for preventing unintended rotation of a film 
spool and a light shield for preventing ambient light from 
entering the cassette interior. A film cassette with a spool lock for preventing 
unintended rotation of the film spool and a light shield for 
preventing ambient light from entering the cassette interior 
is known in the prior art. U.S. Pat. No. 5,115,268 issued 
May 19, 1992 discloses a film cassette comprising a light-trapping 
plush for preventing ambient light from entering 
the cassette interior through a film egress/ingress 
passageway, a film spool supported for rotation in film 
unwinding and film winding directions, and a locking pawl 
supported for movement into engagement with the spool to 
secure the spool and out of engagement with the spool to 
release the spool. The spool has a coaxial ratchet wheel 
with asymmetrically shaped teeth. The locking pawl appears 
to be a rigid beam member which is pivotally mounted at one 
end and has an asymmetrically shaped detent portion at an 
opposite end. A curved spring arm portion of the locking 
pawl extends from the end of the rigid beam member that has 
the detent portion, to bias the detent portion to between 
any two adjacent ones of the teeth in order to secure the 
spool. To remove the detent portion from between the two 
adjacent teeth, an engagement release portion of the locking 
pawl is turned to pivot the rigid beam member against the 
contrary urging of the spring arm portion. The engagement 
release portion then is held in the turned-to position to 
maintain the detent portion separated from the ratchet 
wheel. When the engagement release portion is released, the 
spring arm portion is free to pivot the rigid beam member to  
 
return the detent portion to between any two adjacent ones 
of the teeth in order to re-secure the spool. Since the 
teeth and the detent portion are asymmetrically shaped, it 
appears that the locking pawl can be temporarily forced out 
of engagement with the spool against the contrary urging of 
the spring arm portion when the spool is rotated in a 
winding direction. In prior art U.S. Pat. No. 5,115,268, the film 
cassette is of the type that is capable of advancing a non-protruding 
film leader outwardly from the cassette interior 
when the film spool is rotated in the unwinding direction. 
However, it is possible that the

<CLAIMS>
A film cassette comprising a 
rotatable film spool, a light shield for preventing 

ambient light from entering the cassette interior, and 
a locking pawl movable into engagement with said spool 

to inhibit rotation of the spool but being forced out 
of engagement with the spool when the spool is rotated, 

is characterized in that: 
   said light shield is movable to open; 

and 
   said locking pawl is arranged to move 

said light shield to open responsive to the locking 

pawl being forced out of engagement with said spool 
when the spool is rotated. 
A film cassette as recited in claim 
1, wherein said locking pawl includes resilient means 

for first being temporarily deformed due to the locking 
pawl being forced out of engagement with said spool 

when the spool is rotated and then automatically 
recovering its shape to change the position of the 

locking pawl to move said light shield to open. 
A film cassette as recited in claim 
1, wherein said locking pawl is a lever including an 

end portion held in motion transmitting relation with 
said light shield, a locking piece configured to engage 

said spool to inhibit rotation of the spool, and 
resilient means for first being temporarily deformed 

due to said locking piece being forced out of 
engagement with said spool when the spool is rotated 

and then automatically recovering its shape to change 
the position of said end portion to move said light 

shield to open. 
A film cassette as recited in claim 
3, wherein said resilient means is a pair of 

longitudinal edge portions of said lever separated by a 
longitudinal hole in the lever. 
A film cassette as recited in claim 1, 
wherein said light shield is movable to open and to close; 

and 
   wherein said locking pawl is arranged in 

contact with said light shield for movement by the light 
shield to reengage the spool responsive to the light shield 

being moved to close. 
A film cassette comprising a light 
shield for preventing ambient light from entering the 

cassette interior, is characterized in that: 
   said light shield is movable to open; 

and 
   over-center spring means is coupled with 

said light shield for first being temporarily deformed 
without opening the light shield and then automatically 

recovering its shape to move said light shield to 
open.
