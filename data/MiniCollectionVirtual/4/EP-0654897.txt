<ABSTRACT>
The device allows automatic control of the gain of a radiofrequency receiver including an HF receiving head (3) coupled to a demodulation suite (7) via a programmable attenuator (5). It includes, on the one hand, a memory (12) of attenuation values addressed by the level of the signal applied to the input of the demodulation suite (7) and coupled by its data outputs to the control inputs of the programmable attenuator (12), and, on the other hand, a switch (17) interposed in series between the attenuator (5) and the demodulation suite (7) to isolate the demodulation suite (7) from the attenuator (5) during programming of the attenuator by the attenuation value addressed in the memory (12). Applications: multi-channel radiogoniometry.

<CLAIMS>
Device for automatically controlling the gain
in a radiofrequency reception system, including an HF

reception head (3) coupled to a demodulation system (7)
through a programmable attenuator (5), characterized in

that it comprises, on the one hand, a memory (12) which
contains attenuation values (12), is addressed by the

level of the signal applied to the input of the
demodulation system (7) and is coupled by its data

outputs to the control inputs of the programmable

attenuator (12), and on the other hand a switch (17)
which is interposed in series between the attenuator

(5) and the demodulation system (7) in order to isolate
the demodulation system (7) from the attenuator (5)

when the attenuator is being programmed by the
attenuation value addressed in the memory (12).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it comprises an analogue-to-digital converter (11)

and a sample-and-hold circuit (10) which are connected
in series between the address inputs of the memory (12)

and the input of the demodulation system (7) in order
to select an attenuation value from the memory (12) as

a function of the level of the signal sampled at the
input of the demodulation system (7) by the

sample-and-hold circuit (10).
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the sample-and-hold circuit (10) is coupled to the

input of the demodulation system (7) by means of a peak
detector (9) and a logarithmic amplifier (8) which are

connected in series. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that it comprises a sequencer (13) for

controlling the sample-and-hold circuit (10), the
analogue-to-digital converter (11), the programmable

memory (12) and the switch (17).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the memory (12) containing

attenuation values is a programmable read-only memory.
Use of the device according to any one of
Claims 1 to 5 for the production of multichannel

radio-goniometers.
