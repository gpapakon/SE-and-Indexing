<ABSTRACT>
Novel peptidyl derivatives of formula (I) are found to be potent inhibitors of interleukin-1 beta  converting enzyme (ICE). Compounds of formula (I) may be useful in the treatment of inflammatory or immune-based diseases of the lung and airways; central nervous system and surrounding membranes; the eyes and ears; joints, bones, and connective tissues; cardiovascular system including the pericardium; the gastrointestinal and urogenital systems; the skin and mucosal membranes. Compounds of formula (I) are also useful in treating the complications of infection (e.g., gram negative shock) and tumors in which IL 1 functions as an autocrine growth factor or as a mediator of cachexia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to substituted
peptidyl derivatives useful in the treatment of
inflammation in lung, central nervous system, kidney,
joints, endocardium, pericardium, eyes, ears, skin,
gastrointestinal tract and urogenital system. More
particularly, this invention relates substituted
peptidyl lactones and open forms thereof that are
useful inhibitors of interleukin-1β converting enzyme
(ICE). Interleukin-1β converting enzyme (ICE) has
been identified as the enzyme responsible for
converting precursor interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to
biologically active IL-1β. Mammalian interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an
immunoregulatory protein secreted by cell types as
part of the inflammatory response. The primary cell
type responsible for IL-1 production is the
peripheral blood monocyte. Other cell types have
also been described as releasing or containing IL-1
or IL-1 like molecules. These include epithelial
cells (Luger, et al., J. Immunol. 127: 1493-1498
(1981), Le et al., J. Immunol. 138: 2520-2526 (1987)
and Lovett and Larsen, J. Clin. Invest. 82: 115-122
(1988), connective tissue cells (Ollivierre et al.,
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 141: 904-911 (1986), Le
et al, J. Immunol. 138: 2520-2526 (1987), cells of
neuronal origin (Giulian et al., J. Esp. Med. 164:
594-604 (1986) and leukocytes (Pistoia et al., J.
Immunol. 136: 1688-1692 (1986), Acres et al., Mol.
Immuno. 24: 479-485 (1987), Acres et al., J. Immunol.
138: 2132-2136 (1987) and Lindenmann et al., J.
Immunol 140: 837-839 (1988).Biologically active IL-1 exists in two
distinct forms, IL-1α with an isoelectric point of
about pI 5.2 and IL-1β with an isoelectric point of
about 7.0 with both forms having a molecular mass of
about 17,500 (Bayne et al., J. Esp. Med. 163:
1267-1280 (1986) and Schmidt, J. Esp. Med. 160: 772
(1984). The polypeptides appear evolutionarily
conserved, showing about 27-33% homology at the amino
acid level (Clark et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 14:
7897-7914 (1986). Mammalian IL-1β is synthesized as a cell
associated precursor polypeptide with a molecular
mass of about 31.4 kDa (Limjuco et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci USA 83: 3972-3976 (1986). Precursor IL-1β
is unable to bind to IL-1 receptors and is
biologically inactive (Mosley et al., J. Biol. Chem.
262: 2941-2944 (1987). Biological activity appears
dependent upon some form of proteolytic processing
which results in the conversion of the precursor 31.5
kDa form to the mature 17.5 kDa form. Evidence is
growing that by inhibiting the conversion of
precursor IL-1β to mature IL-1β, one can effectively
