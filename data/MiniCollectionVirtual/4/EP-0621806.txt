<ABSTRACT>
A feedback air pressure sensing system is described, for use with spray guns, comprising an air pressure feedback line (1), an air regulator (2) with an air cap (3). Air is supplied from air line (4) via regulator (2) to a dual air-feedback valve (5) operated by trigger (6). Air continues along line (7) to spreader control valve (8) supplying fan air to spray gun cap (3). Air is also fed via line (9) to supply atomising air to air cap (3). The regulator (2) comprises a body (13), an inlet (16) for a main air supply to first (14) and second (15) air chambers, an inlet for feedback air to a third air chamber (26), a diaphragm (19) between outlet chamber (25) and a pilot chamber (27), the diaphragm (19) being supported in the regulator body (13) by a spring-loaded valve (18), and spring loaded adjustment means (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
 A FEEDBACK AIR PRESSURE SENSING SYSTEMThis invention relates to a feedback air pressu sensing system and more particularly to spray guns i which the spray of atomised fluid can be controlled t produce a fan to round spray pattern.As a result of increased regulations to control t emission of fluids, e.g. paint from spray guns into t atmosphere there is a need to control the pressure of th air flow in the spray gun's air cap to a maximum of 1 psi (0.7 bar). All known spray guns do not provide fo an automatic control of this pressure e.g. when changin the gun's set-up from one spray pattern to another.To ensure the correct pressure of 10 psi (0.7 bar at the air cap the operator currently checks the pressur in the air cap by either direct measurement using a tes cap, or by tabulations which indicate that the pressur reading on the main air pressure supply gauge wil provide a pressure of 10 psi (0.7 bar) at the air cap.Many conventional air supply systems to spray gun have the disadvantage that they cannot maintain 10 ps (0.7 bar) at the air cap during the change of the spra 

 pattern setting between a fan shaped and a round shaped spray. Control of the pressure is at present made b balancing orifices requiring special baffles or bodies for each air cap and the fluid tip set-up used. In such an arrangement the input pressure has no obvious relationship with the output pressure.An aim of the present invention is to provide a feedback air pressure sensing system with an automatic regulator for controlling the output pressure to overcome the above mentioned disadvantage.According to the present invention there is provided a feedback air pressure sensing system comprising an air supply, an air outlet and means to sense the pressure at the air outlet, the air supply being monitored by an air pressure feedback circuit which connects the air outlet with a regulator so that any change in pressure at the air outlet is sensed and fed back to the regulator to increase or decrease the air supply to maintain the air pressure at the air outlet at a predetermined pressure, wherein the regulator comprises a body, an inlet for a main air supply to first and second air chambers, an inlet for a feedback air supply to a third air chamber, a first diaphragm between an outlet chamber and a pilot chamber, the first diaphragm being supported in the regulator body .by a main spring- loaded valve, a second diaphragm between the third air chamber and a spring loaded adjustment means so that adjustment of the adjustment means
