<ABSTRACT>
A clutch release assembly for a pull type clutch comprising a diaphragm spring having radially inwardly projecting spring fingers (11), a clutch release bearing (10), a collar (13) secured to the radially inner ends of the spring fingers by a retainer plate (14), and an elastically deformable ring (19) which is engageable with a detent (27) on the release bearing (10) to axially connect the release bearing to the collar in the clutch release direction (A). The assembly also includes a resilient clip (20) which acts between the inner ends of the diaphragm spring fingers (11) and the release bearing (10) to bias the bearing (10) in the clutch release direction (A) and to hold the bearing (10) against the elastically deformable ring (19).

<DESCRIPTION>
 A CLUTCH RELEASE BEARING ASSEMBLYThis invention relates to a pull type friction clutch particularly for a motor vehicle.A pull type friction clutch is one in which the clutch release bearing is moved away from the friction clutch driven plate in order to release the clutch. A typical vehicle clutch comprises a clutch driven plate sandwiched between an engine flywheel and a pressure plate. The pressure plate is biased towards the flywheel by a diaphragm spring to clamp the driven plate therebetween. In a pull type clutch, the radially inner ends of the spring fingers are pulled away from the driven plate in order to relieve the clamping load on the driven plate. A clutch release bearing must either be fitted to the inner ends of the spring fingers as in EP-A-044691, or alternatively the release bearing must make a snap fit connection to a retainer mechanism which is in turn fitted to the radially inner ends of the spring fingers. The snap fit connection typically utilises a resilient wire ring as one part of the connecting member such as is disclosed in GB-A-2182111. 

A problem associated with such connections is that relative movement between the release bearing and the resilient wire ring can cause wear to the wire ring.The present invention seeks to provide a means of reducing wear to the resilient wire ring.Accordingly there is provided a clutch release assembly for a pull type clutch comprising a diaphragm spring having radially inwardly projecting spring fingers, a clutch release bearing, a collar secured to the radially inner ends of the spring fingers by a retainer plate, and an elastically deformable ring which is engagable with a detent on the release bearing to axially connect the release bearing to the collar in the clutch release direction, characterised in that a resilient clip means acts between the inner ends of the diaphragm spring fingers and the release bearing to bias the bearing in the clutch release direction and hold the bearing against the elastically deformable ring.Preferably the resilient clip means is affixed to the radially inner ends of the spring fingers by the retainer plate. 

Conveniently at least a portion of the elastically deformable ring is mounted on the collar with limited axial play and the resilient clip biases the elastically deformable ring to take up said play in the release direction.The invention will be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:-Fig 1 is a cross section through a release bearing assembly

CLAIMS
1. A clutch release assembly for a pull type clutch comprising a diaphragm spring having radially inwardly projecting spring fingers (11), a clutch release bearing (10), a collar (13) secured to the radially inner ends of the spring fingers by a retainer plate (14), and an elastically deformable ring (19) which is engagable with a detent (27) on the release bearing (10) to axially connect the release bearing to the collar in the clutch release direction (A) , characterised in that a resilient clip means (20) acts between the inner ends of the diaphragm spring fingers
(11) and the release bearing (10) to bias the bearing (10) in the clutch release direction
(A) and hold the bearing (10) against the elastically deformable ring (19).
2. A release bearing assembly as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that the resilient clip means (20) is affixed to the radially inner ends of the spring fingers (11) by the retainer plate (14) . 


3. A release bearing assembly as claimed in Claim 1 and Claim 2 characterised in that the elastically deformable ring (19) is mounted on the collar (13 ) .
4. A release bearing assembly as claimed in any one of Claim 1 to 3 characterised in that at least a portion of the elastically deformable ring (19) is mounted on the collar (13) with limited axial play (18), and the resilient clip (20) biases the elastically deformable ring (19) to take up said axial play in the release direction (A) .
5. A release bearing assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the resilient clip means (20) acts against the axially inner end (25) of the release bearing assembly.
6. A release bearing assembly as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 characterised in that the detent (27) is a raised annular shoulder adjacent the inner end (25) of the release bearing and the reaction load from the resilient clip means (20) is transferred to the elastically deformable ring (19) through said shoulder (27). 


7. A clutch release assembly for a pull type clutch the assembly being constructed and arranged substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to and as shown in the accompanying drawings.
