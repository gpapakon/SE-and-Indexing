<ABSTRACT>
A vibratory material handling apparatus (10) is provided for mixing of 
materials, cleaning, blending and/or shake out of castings or the like. The apparatus 

comprises a container (12) having a material supporting surface (14) 
disposed along a generally 

horizontal longitudinal axis (16). The container has a material 
input end and a material 

discharge end axially spaced therefrom and it is resiliently mounted relative to a 
mounting surface. The apparatus also includes a vibration generator (34) 

for producing 
a force to cause material within the container to be directed in a path of tumbling 

movement generally in a direction from the material input end toward the material 
discharge end of the container. With this arrangement, a 

tumbling assist mechanism (40) 
is provided for applying a force to the material in addition to the force produced by 

the vibration generator (34) to facilitate tumbling of the 
material as it moves along the 

path of tumbling movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to vibratory apparatus and, in
particular, to a vibratory tumbling apparatus for diverse materials and applications.As is known in the art, there are many diverse applications wherein
materials are to be mixed, tumbled and/or blended. Similarly, there are many
manufacturing processes which require the cleaning or shake-out of parts such as
castings, moldings or bulk material, with or without a working media. For both
types of applications, it is useful to utilize a tumbling apparatus to achieve the
intended objective.Some time ago, it was found that an improved finish could be obtained
on cast or molded parts by adding a vibratory motion to a tumbling apparatus. For
instance, in my earlier U.S. Patent No. 3,157,004, an improved burnishing apparatus
using a U-shaped tub mounted on trunnions was disclosed wherein vibratory force
was applied directly to the tub such that the force passed through its center of
gravity. When the U-shaped tub was tilted about the trunnions, the vibratory force
was used for the purpose of discharging the media and parts from the tub.Although improved burnishing of the parts resulted from this use of
vibratory motion in a tumbling apparatus, problems continued with the balance of the
machine. These included wear on bearings and the time it took to obtain the desired
finish. To overcome such problems, a vibrating tumbling apparatus was conceived
and developed as more fully disclosed and claimed in my earlier U.S. Patent No. Re.
33,542.According to that invention, a container is vibrated along small
segments of an arcuate or circular path centered at a point offset from the center of 
the container. The material in the container is moved or conveyed and tumbled not
only due to the coefficient of friction of the material with the surface of the
container, but also due to the angle of attack between the material and the surface of
the container at any given point because of the segmental circular path. While highly
satisfactory tumbling action resulted from this improved arrangement, certain
problems were discovered which required still further attention to more closely
perfect the device.In particular, my earlier U.S. Patent No. Re. 33,542 taught that the
inner surface of the container may be coated or lined. More specifically, this coating
or lining was taught as comprising a material having a particular coefficient of
friction which typically would comprise a material such as rubber or leather, which
material was to aid in the conveying
