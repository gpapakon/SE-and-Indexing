<ABSTRACT>
In a device for coating a substrate (1), having a DC and/or AC power source (10 or 38) which is connected to an electrode (5), arranged in a coating chamber (15, 15a, 15b) which can be evacuated and filled with process gases, which is electrically connected to targets (3, 32) which are sputtered, the one target (3) has an essentially elongate, flat oval shape and is additionally surrounded by a dark shield (34) whose circumferential edge (35), facing the substrate (1), slightly overlaps the front surface of the cathode trough (4), the magnet arrangement, arranged in the cathode trough (4) and held on a yoke (6), being formed by a central row of narrow magnets (8) extending in the longitudinal direction of the targets, a further endless row of narrow magnets (7, 9) arranged on the edge part of the yoke (6), and two round magnets which in each case are located on each end of the central row of magnets (8).
