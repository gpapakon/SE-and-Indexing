Display device having a light conductor for 
detecting the ambient light in front of the display 

device, for example in a motor vehicle, and having a 
sensor which is arranged on the light conductor and, as 

a function of the light detected, emits a control signal 
for controlling the brightness of the display device to 

a controller, characterized in that the light conductor 
(1) has a light-collecting film which projects at least 

a part of the incident light onto at least one of its 
side surfaces (C, D, E, F), and in that the sensor (2) is 

arranged such that it reacts to light emerging from the 
side surfaces (C, D, E, F). 
Display device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the light-collecting film (1) is a plastic 

film. 
Display device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the sensor (2) is arranged 

on at least one of the side surfaces (C, D, E, F). 
Display device according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the sensor (2) has a photoresistor, a 

photodiode or a phototransistor element. 
Display device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the display device has a 

liquid crystal display (LCD display). 
Display device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the brightness of the 

display device (3) can be adjusted manually by means of 
an adjusting element (26). 
Display device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the side surfaces (C, D, E,  

 
F) through which the light flux does not pass are at 

least partially reflective. 
Display device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a measuring device is 

provided, which counts the elements of the display device 
(3) which are connected in a transluscent manner and sets 

them as a factor to the ratio to the maximally 
transluscent elements. 
Display device according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the light flux of the lighting 

device (21) is corrected by means of the factor in such 
a manner that the light flux is correspondingly reduced 

for a small number of transluscent display elements and, 
conversely, it is correspondingly increased for a large 

number of transluscent elements. 
Display device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the light conductor (1) is 

arranged in front of or behind the display device (3).
