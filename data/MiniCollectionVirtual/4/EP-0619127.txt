<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ski for sliding over snow. The ski comprises a longitudinal beam, the front end (2) of which is raised in order to form the tip. The ski is characterised in that it has, over a part of its length, a caisson (box) structure and, over the rest of its length, a sandwich structure. The ski preferably has a caisson structure at least in its median zone (10) of the underfoot portion and a sandwich structure at least in one of the front or rear zones (11, 12).

Ski for gliding on the snow, comprising a longitudinal 
beam with a turned up front end (2) forming a spatula, a gliding 

sole (3) and lateral running edges (4, 5), characterized by the 
fact that it has a box type structure along a portion of its 

length, with a central core (15, 55) surrounded by an upper 
reinforcement wall (16, 56), two lateral reinforcement walls (18, 

19, 58, 59) and a lower reinforcement wall (17, 27, 28, 57), and 
along another portion of its length, separate from the first 

portion, a sandwich type structure, with a central core (15, 55), 
an upper reinforcement wall (16, 56) and a lower reinforcement wall 

(17, 57). 
Ski according to claim 1, comprising three continuous 
zones, a central zone (10, 50) comprising the mounting zone of the 

binding elements, a front zone (11, 51) towards the front and a 
rear zone (12, 52) towards the rear, characterized by the fact that 

it has a box structure in at least its central zone (10, 50), and 
a sandwich structure in at least one of the front or rear zones 

(11, 12, 52). 
Ski according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
it has a box structure in the central zone (10), and a sandwich 

structure in both the front and rear end zones (11, 12). 
Ski according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that 
the beam has a box structure in its central (50) and front (51) 

zones, and a sandwich structure in its rear zone (52). 
Ski according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that 
the beam has, in its upper portion, a continuous upper 

reinforcement wall (16) which, locally, is continuously extended 
laterally in a known fashion, by two lateral extensions (22, 23) 

which constitute the lateral reinforcement walls (18, 19, 58, 59) 
of the box structure, and that these lateral walls are downwardly 

connected to the lower reinforcement wall (17, 57), or to the 
running edges (4, 5).  

 
Ski according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that 
the present upper reinforcement wall is formed by a band (36) with 

a substantially constant width, and that the lateral walls are 
lateral portions (36, 40) of an attached element (37). 
Ski according to claim 6, characterized by the fact that 
the attached element (37) has two lateral extensions (39, 40), and 

a central portion (38) which is superposed to the upper 
reinforcement band (36) so as to form locally a double 

reinforcement thickness in the top portion of the ski. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the lateral reinforcement walls (22, 

23, 39, 40) have a planar trapezoidal shape. 
Ski according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the lateral reinforcement walls 

(39a, 40a) have a planar parallelogram shape.
