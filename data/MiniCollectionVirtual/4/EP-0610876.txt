<ABSTRACT>
The improved washing machine is provided with a device for the 
recovery and dissolution of the detergent, constituted by a pipe 

(28) with an hydraulic air vessel (30) and a tube (32) which 
connects said vessel to the detergent-holding cup (20), and has a 

circuit for the recirculation of the washing water. Said circuit 
comprises a tube (38), which branches from pipe (28), which 

passes through the bellows-gasket (40) circumscribing door (16) 
and extends into wash-tub (12). A pump (26) drives at the same 

time the fluid into pipe (28) and tube (38), from which it is 
pulse-conveyed into said wash-tub. During the washing or 

prewashing, gasket (14) is caused to rotate, eiher periodically 
or continuously, at a speed of between 80 and 12 rotations per 

minute; therefore, the linen draws up peripherally in said basket 
and is directly hit by the fluid running from the bent end (42) 

of tube (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved washing machine. More particularly, this invention relates to an improved washing 
machine provided with devices for the recirculation of the 
washing water where the detergent has been preliminarily 
dissolved. Different types of rotatory basket washing machines, 
which perform the washing operations according to different 
methods, are known to prior art. The most traditional method performs washing by repeated 
immersion of the linen into the water contained on the bottom of 
the machine. The continuous rotation, intermittent and in 
alternate direction, of the basket causes the linen to move 
within said basket and to plunge repeatedly into the washing 
fluid. A second method, which also comprises a rotatory basket and the 
systematic immersion of the linen into the washing water, 
involves the presence of special devices which convey part of the 
water from the bottom of the wash-tub upwards, to unload it on to 
the linen, in order to achieve, at least partly, a so-called 
aspersion washing. According to a further method, the washing water, which is caused 
to recirculate in the wash-tub, is run through a pump into the 
drilled basket in the form of jets of fluid. The two last methods 
are, on the whole, an improvement in washing compared to the 
traditional immersion system, as they allow to bring linen in 
touch with much more washing fluid. However, all of the aforementioned systems have some drawbacks 
and limits.  A first drawback, which concerns in general all of the known 
washing machines, arises from the fact that the detergent 
introduced into the wash-tube through the traditional cup, gets 
lost to a large extent through the discharge pipe. Besides, the 
detergent requires in general a rather long time to fully 
dissolve and to be therefore capable of developing an efficacious 
activity on the linen. Still a further drawback, which can be noticed in the washing 
machines that utilize the aspersion washing system, arises from 
the fact that the washing water caused to recirculate falls 
unpressurized on to the linen; the efficaciousness of this 
activity on the linen to be washed is therefore limited. A non negligible drawback can be noticed also in the washing 
machines provided with a system of jet-recirculation of water. 
The water jets ejected by the pump are sent against the wall of 
the drilled basket where linen is contained; therefore, the water 
reaching it is not sufficiently pressurized, and has therefore a 
poor efficaciousness, as jets
