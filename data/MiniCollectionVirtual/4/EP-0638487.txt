<ABSTRACT>
A plastic multi-layer container comprises an inner 
layer (6) and an outer layer (2) of a moisture resistant 

thermoplastic resin, and an intermediate layer (4) of a gas 
barrier resin interposed between said two layers, 

wherein any layer on the inside of the intermediate 
layer is blended with an adsorbent that has a specific 

surface area of not smaller than 1.0 mÂ²/g. The 
container is capable of effectively preventing the 

content from catching offensive taste or offensive odor, 
and is useful for packaging boiled rice or the like of 

which the flavor can be difficultly retained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plastic
multi-layer container having excellent property for
retaining flavor of the content. More specifically, the
invention relates to a plastic multi-layer container
having excellent property for preventing foods from
being oxidized and degraded as well as flavor-retaining
property in combination, and to a boiled rice-packaging
material using the same plastic multi-layer container.Metal cans, glass bottles and a variety of plastic
containers have heretofore been used as packaging
containers. Among them, the plastic containers have
been used for a variety of applications since they are
light in weight, have shock resistance and are cheaply
produced.However, though metal cans and glass bottles do
not permit oxygen to pass through the walls, plastic
containers permit oxygen to pass through the walls to a
degree that cannot be neglected, imposing a problem from
the standpoint of preserving the contents.In order to prevent this problem, therefore, a
multi-layer structure is employed for the walls of
plastic containers, and a resin that does not permit
oxygen to permeate through, such as an ethylene/vinyl
alcohol copolymer or the like is used for at least one
of the layers.Resins having an oxygen barrier property such as
ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer or the like is
susceptible to the humidity and tends to permit oxygen 
to permeate through upon absorbing moisture. In order
to prevent this problem, Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 170748/1982 discloses a multi-layer
plastic container which is provided with a resin layer
containing a moisture absorbent close to the
ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer layer. Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 11339/1986 disclosesone having a thermoplastic resin medium in which are
dispersed highly water-absorbing resin particles between
a gas barrier resin layer and a moisture resistant resin
layer.According to the above prior art, permeation of
oxygen through the container wall is suppressed, and the
content is prevented from being oxidized or degraded,
i.e., to enhance the preservability of the content. It
was, however, found that the flavor retentivity of the
content is often lost even in an environment where the
content is prevented from being oxidized and degraded.
This tendency becomes conspicuous particularly for the
boiled rice and the like that have not been seasoned.When the container containing the content is heated
using a microwave oven or the like, offensive taste and
offensive odor are produced leaving much of
