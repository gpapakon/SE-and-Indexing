<ABSTRACT>
The pacemaker (1) includes a suture-free casing 
(2), a pulse generator (33, 36, 37, 38) having at least 

one electrode tip (5) preferably projecting out of said 
casing (2) and being insulated (4) therefrom, whereby no plug-receptacle 

nor electrode catheter is required and the pacemaker 
(1) may be slipped into the pericardial sac (15, 16) and 

imprisioned between the bottom of the sac and the facing 
lower heart portion (see Fig. 18) to become thereby into 

pulse transmitting relationship with the epicardium of the 
heart (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pacemaker to 
be used for stimulating, by direct contact, the epicardium 
and eventually the myocardium of the heart, as well as it 
refers also to a way of applying through direct contact 
implanting said pacemaker in an optimum position onto the 
epicardium of the heart. More particularly, the pacemaker of the present 
invention has one or several stimulating electrode tips 
incorporated to the pacemaker's casing, said electrode 
tip(s) being accessible from outside. The terminology used in this particular art is 
not uniform throughout the world; in order to avoid any 
misunderstanding in connection with this specification and 
its appendant claims, the following terminology will be 
used: The heart is a muscle consisting of three 
layers, an outer layer called "epicardium", an intermediate 
layer called "myocardium" and an inner layer called 
"endocardium", which actually circumscribes the ventricular 
and auricular chambers of the heart. The expression "electrode tip" is generally used 
in this art, as refering to the free end of an insulated 
wire called "electrode" or "catheter", which in the known 
pacemaker is connected by its opposite or connecting end 
to the pacemaker's terminal or connector, housed in a 
plug-receptacle forming part of the pacemaker's casing and 
being accessible from outside - see U.S. patents Nrs. 
4,848,346 (K. F. Crawford) and 4,818,173 (T. D. Daglow) - . 
The electrode tip is destined to be connected to the heart 
either to its outside layer or epicardium or through a 
pervenous implantation to the endocardium. In short, the 
electrode tip is the tip through which electric current is 
supplied to stimulate the heart muscle by the pertinent 
source and electric circuit housed in the pacemaker's housing. The expression "suture-free" is to be interpreted 
as refering to contacting the pacemaker of the present invention  
 
with the epicardium,without requiring to sew the 
casing of the pacemaker to the heart, be it by actual sewing 
or attaching the casing by any other means to the heart, 
such as by glueing, stitching or strapping it to the heart 
or by screwing it into the heart, all procedures of which 
require major surgery (see for instance published PCT application 
serial number WO 92/2040 2 - Gray; U.S.Patent 4,256,115 
- Billitch; U.S Patent 4,157,720-Greatbatch; Russian Inventor 
Certificate 507,325 - Belgov). According to the information available to us, 
since 1958, the year corresponding to the first permanent 
implantation

<CLAIMS>
A pacemaker (1), usable to stimulate an organ 
such as the heart, characterized in comprising a suture-free 

casing (2) housing a pulse generator (33, 36, 37, 38) connected 
to at least one electrode tip (5) forming part of the 

outer surface (2A) of said casing (2) and being electrically 
insulated therefrom, said electrode tip (5) comprising means 

(5A) to directly entering into non-perforating contact with 
the epicardium (17) of the heart (9) without piercing the 

epicardium (17). 
A pacemaker as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that said casing (2) has an upper outer surface (2A) 

including at least one opening (3) wherein an electricity 
insulating socket (4) is sealingly housed, said electrode 

tip (5) projecting out of said upper outer surface (2A) 
through said socket (4). 
A pacemaker as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that said socket (4) is provided with means for 

remote controlable release of biomedical materials. 
A pacemaker as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the upper outer face includes 

a plurality of spaced apart openings, each housing a socket 
(1204) with a pertinent electrode tip (1205). 
A pacemaker as claimed in claim 4, characterized 
in that each electrode tip (1205) is independantly excitable. 
A pacemaker as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the casing thereof is provided 

with at least one of the following means: detachable anchoring 
means (628), signal means (729) enabling to trace said 

 
pacemaker upon being surrounded by fibrous tissues, said casing 

(802) having a pointed front end portion (830) to facilitate 
the slipping-in of said pacemaker into the pericardial 

sac (16) of the heart (6) and a net-like anchoring structure 
(628) detachably fixed to said casing (602). 
A pacemaker as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said casing (1000) is biconcavely 

shaped. 
A pacemaker as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that saisd casing (902) includes a 

projecting, bendable nose portion (931) housing said electrode 
tip (905). 
A pacemaker as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, charcterized in that said electrode tip (1105) is 

surrounded by a compressible sponge-like material (1132). 
Way of direct contact implanting a pacemaker

tip (5) comrising means (5A) for directly entering into non-perforating 

contact with the epicardium (17) of the heart (9) 
without piercing the epicardium (17), wherein access (22) is 

provided to the patient's pericardium (16) by a subxiphoid 
abdominal approach (20, 21), which comprises opening said 

pericardium (16) to gain access to the pericardial sac (16), 
slipping said pacemaker (1) into the cavity (15) existing 

between the inner surface of said pericardium (16) and the
