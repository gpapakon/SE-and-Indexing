<ABSTRACT>
The web exhibits a plurality of parts which extend in the longitudinal direction of the web and are located one against the other. These parts may be sheet-metal punched parts or cast parts which can be produced very cost-effectively. Two outer parts (8a) may form a shell (8) into which a punched inner part (12) consisting of steel is inserted. Said two parts (8a) can be produced cost-effectively as cast parts, for example from zinc or aluminium, or moulded parts, for example consisting of plastic, and the inner part (12) can be produced cost-effectively as a sheet-metal punch part. The invention permits a particularly cost-effective production of the web and proves to be particularly stable in the case of bending tests.

Joining web for a mortise-type double cylinder lock, which
is rod-shaped and connects two cylinder housing parts (la, 1b) to one

another and has a central part (10, 14) with a threaded bore (15) to
receive a sleeve screw, as well as two limbs (9, 13), which are to be

engaged in a recess (4) of a cylinder pocket (2) and, by means of a
transverse pin (20), are firmly connected therein, characterized in

that it is manufactured from at least two parts (8, 12), a shell (8)
and an inner part (12) placed in the shell (8), such that said parts

(8, 12) extend over the length of the web and are placed against one
another, in a way that upon bending they can dislocate slightly towards

each other.
Web according to Claim 1, characterized in that it is manufactured
from three parts (8a, 8a, 12), at least one part (12) being

a punched sheet-metal part.
Web according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that two
outer parts (8a, 8a) form a shell (8) in which the inner part (12) is

placed.
Web according to Claim 3, characterized in that the inner
part (12) is a punched part.
Web according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that at least one part (8) is a cast part.
Web according to one of Claims 3 to 5, characterized in
that the shell (8) has two semi-shells (8a).
Web according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it is
manufactured from three punched parts.
Web according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that at least one part (8a) is manufactured from zinc, aluminium or

plastic material.
Web according to Claim 3, characterized in that the shell
(8) is manufactured from nickel chromium steel.
Web according to Claim 1, characterized in that only an
inner part (12) has a threaded bore (15) for a sleeve screw.
