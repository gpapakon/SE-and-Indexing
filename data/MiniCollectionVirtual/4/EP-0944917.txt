<ABSTRACT>
Metallic osmium on SiC (either  beta  or  alpha ) forms a contact that remains firmly attached to the SiC surface and forms an effective barrier against diffusion from the conductive metal. On n-type SiC (12), Os (20) forms an abrupt Schottky rectifying junction having essentially unchanged operating characteristics to at least 1050  DEG C and Schottky diodes that remain operable to 1175  DEG C and a barrier height over 1.5 eV. On p-type SiC, Os forms an ohmic contact with specific contact resistance of

. Ohmic and rectifying contacts to a TiC layer (30) on a SiC substrate (12) are formed by depositing a WC layer (32) over the TiC layer (30), followed by a metallic W layer (34). Such contacts are stable to at least 1150  DEG C. Electrodes (38) connect to the contacts either directly or via a protective bonding layer (36) such as Pt or PtAu alloy.

 Os RECTIFYING SCHOTTKY AND OHMIC JUNCTION AND W/WC/TiC OHMIC CONTACTS ON SiCBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to electrical contacts on SiC-based semiconductor devices, and more particularly to ohmic and rectifying contacts on silicon carbide semiconductors.SiC possesses tremendous advantages for high temperature and high power solid state electronics. In addition, it offers potential advantages for high frequency and logic circuit applications: e.g., power conversion (mixer diodes, MESFETs) , single chip computers (n-MOS, CMOS, bipolar transistors) , non-volatile random access memory SiC CCDs can hold charge for more than a thousand years thus, for example, making hard disks a thing of the past.The potential maximum average power, maximum operating temperature, thermal stability, and the reliability of SiC electronics far exceeds Si or GaAs based electronics. The degree to which these advantages of SiC can be utilized, however, is presently constrained by the thermal stability and electrical properties of the metal/SiC junctions. The primary reasons for this are: (1) the power density of SiC devices is limited by the thermal stability of the ohmic contact junctions, and (2) substantial cooling is required to insure the stability of electrical contact junctions. 

 For a long time, researchers have been striving without success to develop electrical contacts to silicon carbide trying overcome these constraints. Until these constraints are removed, SiC devices/circuits offer only marginal - if any - advantages over Si and GaAs. Utilization of the full performance potential of SiC itself (for all devices) , requires four types of performance- limiting electrical contacts: (1) ohmic to p-type SiC, (2) ohmic to n-type SiC, (3) rectifying to p-type SiC, and (4) rectifying to n-type SiC.The value of SiC electronics lies in its potential to extend the capabilities of solid state electronics beyond what is possible with Si or GaAs. Thus, suitable electrical contact characteristics obtained in the laboratory - under low stress conditions - must not drift or degrade, due to changes at the metal/SiC junctions, under actual device operating conditions. This requires two additional attributes of metal/SiC electrical contacts. First, the contact metal must form a junction with SiC that is chemically stable to approximately 1000Â°C (joule heating at high forward current densities in power SiC devices could easily cause metal/SiC junctions to reach such temperatures) . Second, the contact
