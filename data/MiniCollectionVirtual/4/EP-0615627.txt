A seismic acquisition system with decentralised
processing capability, used in particular to reduce

significantly the volume of data exchanged between at
least one acquisition device (B1) programmed to collect

the data received by an array of seismic receivers (Ri)
coupled with a zone under exploration and at least one

control unit (1, 6) by means of linking means, each
acquisition device (Bi) having at least one acquisition

chain (CA
1
-CA
n
) for digitising the signals received by
one or more receivers coupled with said zone in

response to seismic signals transmitted in the zone
under exploration, a control unit (Ai) to pilot the

acquisition and store the signals as well as process
the acquired signals and a transmitter-receiver unit

(3) communicating with the control unit, characterised
in that each control unit has a first management unit

(2) and a processor specialised in signal processing
DSP (7) which is driven by the management unit (2) and

programmed to run quality checks on each seismic
receiver and each acquisition chain, said processor (7)

being set up to function in two different operating
modes, one an active mode during which said data are

processed and the other a stand-by mode during which
power consumption is very much reduced.
A system as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that each control unit is set up to determine,

without a delay, the electrical and electro-mechanical
characteristics of each seismic receiver by determining

parameters of an electric circuit modelling said
receiver.
A system as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that it has means for

compressing digital signals to be transmitted.
A system as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that it has means for

combining seismic signals received at different
instants by one or more of said receivers.
A system as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the control unit is a

central station for controlling and recording seismic
signals.
A system as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the control unit is a

control box (6) which can be linked to each acquisition
device by a short link, such as an infrared-ray link,

and allows an operator to issue instructions to run
quality control checks immediately in order to check

that each receiver is correctly installed and each
acquisition chain is operating correctly.
A system as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that each acquisition device

has two memory blocks (M
1
, M
2
) for storing alternately
data received during successive transmission-reception

cycles and transmission means (3, 4, TC) for
transmitting at least a proportion of the data

contained in a first (M
1
) of the two memory blocks
whilst data are being acquired and stored in the second

memory block (M
2
).
A system as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that each acquisition device

has a re-writeable permanent memory (Mp) for
instructions received from the control unit (1, 6) via

said linking means (3, 4, TC).
A system as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that each acquisition device

has a first and a second switching module (Sw1, SW2)
assigned to each receiver in order to connect it and a

reference resistance (RO) successively to the input of
a signal acquisition chain (CA), a third and a fourth 

switching module (SW3, SW4) connected to a power pack
(8) to apply voltage or current pulses to the receiver

(R) and the assigned reference resistance (RO) and at
least one local oscillator (9) for applying signals of

a given frequency and/or amplitude to the input of the
acquisition chain.
A system as claimed in the preceding claim,
characterised in that it has switching means (I9) for

applying said signals of a given frequency successively
to several receivers assigned to a same acquisition

device and means for measuring crosstalk and
distortion.
A system as claimed in claim 9, characterised
in that the processing means are programmed to control

said switching modules (SW1-SW4) in order to measure
leakage currents between each receiver (Ri)and the

ground.
A system as claimed in claim 10 or 11,
characterised in that the processing means are

programmed to apply fast Fourier transforms (FFT) in
order to test each acquisition chain (CA).
A system as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the control unit (2, 7)

is programmed to correlate the seismic signals received
by the receivers with the seismic signals transmitted

and to transmit the results of the correlations to the
transmitter-receiver unit so that they can be

transmitted on to the control unit (1, 6).
A system as claimed in claim 2, characterised
in that each control unit (2. 7) has means for testing

each seismic receiver after it has been installed in
the field by setting up an equivalent electric circuit

by iteration, modelling as best possible the electrical
and electro-mechanical characteristics of each seismic

receiver.
