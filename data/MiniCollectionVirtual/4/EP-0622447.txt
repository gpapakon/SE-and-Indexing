<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions 
comprising lipases. More in particular, the present invention 
relates to dye transfer inhibiting compositions comprising a 
specific class of lipase. Detergent compositions comprising enzymes are well known in 
the art. It is also well recognized that enzyme deactivation 
occurs in detergent compositions formulated with enzymes.
 
The loss of detergent activity of enzymes is among others 
depending on the presence of adjunct detergent ingredients.
 
One type of adjunct detergent ingredients that is added to 
detergent ingredients are metallo catalysts.
 
Said metallo catalysts are added to detergent compositions in 
order to inhibit the transfer of dyes from colored fabrics onto 
other fabrics washed therewith. These catalysts have the 
ability to oxidize the fugitive dyes washed out of dyed fabrics 
before the dyes have the opportunity to become attached to the 
fabrics in the wash.
 
 
Copending European patent application No EP 92870181.2 
describes metallo catalysts which are very efficient in 
eliminating the transfer of solubilized or suspended dyes. It has now been found that with the use of a particular class 
of lipases an improved overall detergency performance can be 
obtained with dye transfer inhibiting compositions formulated 
with metallo-catalysts. This finding allows to formulate detergent compositions which 
exhibit excellent dye transfer inhibiting properties while not 
adversely affecting the lipolytic activity. According to another embodiment of this invention a process 
is also provided for laundering operations involving colored 
fabrics. The present invention relates to inhibiting dye transfer 
compositions comprising metallo catalysts and an efficient 
amount of bleaching agent in combination with a specific class 
of lipases. An essential ingredient of the present invention is an active 
lipolytic enzyme characterized in that the aminoacid sequence 
contains no methionine.
 
Preferred lipases are the fungal lipases producible by Humicola 
lanuginosa.
 
The lipases are producible by a host organism in which the DNA 
encoding for the lipase has been cloned and expressed.
 
Preferably the lipase is producible by the host organism 
Aspergillus.
 
Highly preferred lipases are lipases producible by cloning the 
gene from the fungal lipases producible by Humicola languginosa 
and expressing the gene in in Aspergillus oryzae as described  
 
in European patent Application 0 258 068, which is commercially 
available under the
