Rubber bearing for the central pin of a leaf spring 

suspension means in a motor vehicle, consisting of a 
housing which is divided in an axial plane and consists 

of two half shells and a rubber sleeve arranged with 
radial bias on the pin and consisting of two half shells 

which are fixed axially on the pin by at least one 
radially engaging groove and spring construction and of 

which the abutting surfaces which oppose one another in 
the assembled state are peripherally spaced from one 

another in the pre-assembled state, characterized in that 
the half shells (3, 4) of the rubber sleeve (1) are 

connected to one another at their ends by flexible webs 
(5) with spacing permitting the radially enlarged rubber 

sleeve (1) to be pushed axially onto the pin (7) and have 
recesses (12) receiving the webs (5) which fold in under 

radial compression. 
Rubber bearing according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the webs (5) which connect the half shells (3, 4) of 

the rubber sleeve (1) to one another are slightly shorter 
than the radial dimension of the groove and spring 

construction (8, 9) engaging in the assembled state. 
Rubber bearing according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the half shells (3, 4) of the rubber sleeve (1) 

each have a metal inlay (2) of which the abutting 
surfaces which rest on one another after assembly project 

relative to the material of the rubber sleeve (1) in the 
pre-assembled state.
