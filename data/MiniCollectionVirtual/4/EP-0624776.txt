Procedure for detecting stretches of rough road 
for a motor vehicle driven by an internal combustion 

engine 

having a fuel tank which serves to store fuel temporarily 
and 
a pressure sensor which serves to detect fuel tank 
pressure values 
 
characterized 


in that the fuel tank pressure values (TD
n
) are 
detected at successive evaluation times (n, n-1), 
the change in the fuel tank pressure (DTD) is determined 
from successive fuel tank pressure values (TD
n
, 
TD
n-1
), 
the change in the fuel tank pressure (DTD) is compared 
with a prescribed limit value (GW) and 
a stretch of rough road is detected when this limit 
value (GW) is exceeded. 
Procedure according to Claim 1 characterized 
in that, before the comparison with the limit value (GW), 

the change in the fuel tank pressure (DTD) is subjected 
to averaging (MDTD) with a selectable averaging constant. 
Procedure according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the absolute values of the change in the fuel 

tank pressure (DTD) are formed, the latter are added 
together over a prescribable time interval and it is only 

this sum which is compared with a prescribable limit 
value. 
Procedure according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the limit value (GW) is obtained from a 

characteristic diagram as a function of the operating  
 

variables of the motor vehicle at a given time, in 
particular the vehicle speed and the filling level of the 

fuel tank. 
Procedure according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the evaluation rate for the evaluation of the 

fuel tank pressure (DTD) is obtained from a characteristic 
diagram as a function of the operating variables of 

the motor vehicle at a given time, in particular the 
vehicle speed and the filling level of the fuel tank at 

a given time. 
Procedure according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the averaging constant used is obtained from a 

characteristic diagram as a function of the evaluation 
rate of the fuel tank pressure (DTD) and the operating 

variables of the motor vehicle at a given time, in 
particular the vehicle speed and the filling level of the 

fuel tank. 
Procedure according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a procedure for detecting combustion misfires of 

the internal combustion engine is blanked out if a 
stretch of rough road is detected. 
Procedure according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the blanking out takes place for a prescribable 

time period. 
Procedure according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the blanking out takes place for as long as the 

differential value (DTD) is above the limit value (GW). 
Procedure according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the blanking out of the combustion misfire 

detection procedure takes place only if other procedures, 
carried out additionally in parallel, for detecting 

stretches of rough road indicate a stretch of rough road 
with a prescribable reliability.
