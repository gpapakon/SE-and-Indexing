<ABSTRACT>
A composition for delivering an active agent to the lymphatic system comprises a plurality of colloidal particles and an active agent associated with each particle, wherein the surface of each particle has a hydrophobicity ratio as defined of less than 10, or wherein a modifying agent is adsorbed onto the surface of each particle such that the modifying agent gives an advancing contact angle as defined of less than 60  or wherein the adsorbed layer thickness as defined is less than 10 nm or the albumin uptake ratio is between 0.2 and 0.5. The composition may satisfy one or more of these requirements. Preferred modifying agents are non-ionic surfactants, in particular block copolymers containing polyethyleneglycol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lymphatic delivery composition, and
more particularly to a composition for delivering an active agent to the
lymphatic system.The lymphatic system has an important role in transporting body fluids
and particulate materials to include proteins, fat particles, etc. Large proteins
and certain cells (lymphocytes) pass from the blood plasma into the tissue fluid
and it is the major function of the lymph to return these essential components
to the blood circulation. The lymph also plays an important role in transporting
the products of fat digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, the chylomicrons, into
the blood circulation. The properties of the lymphatic system have been
reviewed in detail by J.M. Yoffrey and F.C. Courtice (Lymphatics, lymph and
the lymphomyeloid complex, Academic Press, London, 1970). The lymphatic
system also plays an important role in the spread of tumours. Malignant cells
can enter the lymphatic system and become captured by lymph nodes where
secondary tumours can be produced. Eventually the whole of the lymph chain
can be involved. The lymph can also be involved in the spread of tumours to
other organs, for example the lungs. Consequently there is considerable need
for a method of examining the lymphatic drainage and lymph nodes in the
diagnosis and treatment of malignant diseases. This subject has been reviewed
extensively by S.E. Strand and others (L. Bergquist et al. in Microspheres and
Drug Therapy, Immunological and Medical Aspects p.263 (Edited by Davis et
al.) Elsevier 1984).It is well known that colloidal particles can have an important role in
characterising the properties of the lymphatic system as well as a possible role
in delivering drugs to the lymphatic system. The use of colloidal particles as
radiodiagnostic agents has been reviewed by Strand et al. (Bergquist et al. 
Seminars in Nuclear Med. 12 (1983) 9-19). A wide range of materials has
been examined to include solid particles, emulsions and vesicles (liposomes).
The distribution of colloidal agents depends strongly on their particle size and
colloids suggested for lymphoscintigraphy were found to have a median size of
about 40-60 nm. Uptake into regional lymph nodes after, for example,
subcutaneous administration is quite small and values from 1-10% are typical
after 2-5 hours (Strand, S.E. CRC Crit. Rev. Drug Carrier Systems 6 (1989)
211-237).A targeting system for the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents
to the lymphatic system should have the following characteristics:
