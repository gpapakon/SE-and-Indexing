<ABSTRACT>
Method for preparing taxane derivatives of general formula (I) by esterification at a temperature between -10 and 60  DEG C of a derivative of baccatine III or 10-deacetyl baccatine III of general formula (II) by means of an acid of general formula (III), followed by replacement of the protective groupings G1, G2 and R2 of the resulting product by hydrogen atoms. In formulae (I), (II) or (III), Ar stands for an aryl radical; R stands for hydrogen or acetyl; R1 is benzoyl or tert.butoxycarbonyl; G1 is a hydroxy function protective grouping, G2 stands for the acetyl radical or a hydroxy function protective grouping, and R2 stands for a hydroxy function protective grouping.

Process for the preparation of taxane derivatives 
of general formula: 


 
in which Ar represents an aryl radical, R represents a 

hydrogen atom or an acetyl radical and R
1
 represents a 
benzoyl or tert-butoxycarbonyl radical, by esterification 

of a derivative of baccatin III or of 10-deacetylbaccatin 
III of general formula: 


 
in which G
1
 represents a protecting group of the hydroxyl 

functional group, such as a 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl 
radical or a trialkylsilyl radical, each alkyl part of 

which contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and G
2
 represents an 
acetyl radical or a protecting group of the hydroxyl 

functional group, such as a 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl 
radical, using an acid of general formula:  

 

 
in which Ar and R
1
 are defined as above and R
2
 represents 
a protecting group of the hydroxyl functional group, such 

as a methoxymethyl, 1-ethoxyethyl, benzyloxymethyl, 
(β-trimethylsilylethoxy)methyl, tetrahydropyranyl, 

2,2,2-trichloroethoxymethyl or 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl 
radical, followed by replacement of the protecting 

groups G
1
, G
2
 and R
2
 of the product obtained by 
hydrogen atoms, characterised in that esterification is 

carried out at a temperature of between -10 and 60°C 
(60°C not included). 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that esterification is carried out in an organic solvent 

chosen from the ethers, ketones, esters, nitriles, 
aliphatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons 

and aromatic hydrocarbons. 
Process according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the solvent is chosen from the esters and aromatic 

hydrocarbons. 
Process according to one of claims 1, 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the esterification is carried out 

in the presence of a condensation agent and of an 
activating agent. 
Process according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the condensation agent is a carbodiimide. 
Process according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the activating agent is an aminopyridine. 
Process according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the carbodiimide is dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 
Process according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the aminopyridine is 4-dimethylaminopyridine or 

4-pyrrolidinopyridine.
