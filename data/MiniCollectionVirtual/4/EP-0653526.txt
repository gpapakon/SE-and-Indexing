<ABSTRACT>
The prefabricated seal for corners, in buildings, where two walls or roof sections butt at right angles to each other, has four strips (2a-2d) with the two strips (2a, 2b) against the wall surfaces at right angles to each other along their length. The two strips (2c, 2d) against the floor or roof surface butt against each other in a mitre joint (4) along their length, also at right angles. The strips (2a-2d) of a moisture impermeable material are also sealed against moisture penetration at their joints. Also claimed is a mfg. process where a rectangular section is cut from a woven, knitted or non-woven material, with cutouts at the long sides, and rubber strips also with cutouts are laid over the sides with the cutouts of each aligned with each other. The material and rubber strips are folded into the shape of the seal (1) and placed in a heated mould to vulcanise the rubber to the material.
