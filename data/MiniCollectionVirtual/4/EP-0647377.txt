<ABSTRACT>
In the process for identifying a programme information containing audio and/or video data programme information, especially a music title, a special identification code is first allocated to the data programme information. The audio and/or video data and the identification code are transmitted by a transmitter (1) to a receiver (2) and separated at the receiver by means of a filter (3). During the reproduction of the audio and/or video data, an operator input is monitored by means of which the operator can demand the identification of the data programme information just received. The operator input via an input device (4) is acquired by a control device (5). The identification code is stored in a store (6) at each operator input. The identification code can subsequently be read out of the store (6') with the aid of a read-out device (10) and further processed. Additional data on the programme information (e.g. interpreter, title, composer) are read out of a data bank (11) with the aid of the identification code and displayed and/or printed out via an output device (12).

Method of identifying a transmission containing audio and/or video information, in
particular a musical title, in which identification information is assigned to the

transmission and the audio and/or video information and the identification
information are transmitted by a transmitter (1) to a receiver (2), the identification

information is separated from the audio and/or video information at the receiving
end, an operator input by means of which the operator requests identification of the

current transmission is monitored during the reproduction of the audio and/or video
information of the transmission, the identification information is stored upon each

operator input in a non-volatile memory (6) which can be removed from the
receiver (2), the memory (6) is removed from the receiver (
2) and is connected to a
separate reading device (10) and the identification information is read out of the

memory (6) by means of the reading device (10) and is further processed in order to
identify the transmission.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the identification information
contains a code which is decoded once it has been read out of the memory (6).
Method according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 information about the
transmission, e.g. the title, the performer and the composer of a musical title, is

assigned to the code, that the code and the information assigned thereto are filed in
a database (11), that the reading device (10) is connected to the database (11) and

that, once the identification information has been read out of the memory (6), the
information about the transmission is retrieved from the database (11) with the aid

of the identification information and output.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the identification
information is transmitted simultaneously with the audio and/or video information

and, once it has been separated from the audio and/or video information, is stored
temporarily for a predetermined period of time at the receiving end and that the

temporarily stored identification information is stored in the non-volatile memory 
(6) in the event of an operator input effected within the predetermined period of

time.
