<ABSTRACT>
An anti-allergic pharmaceutical composition for 
ophthalmic topical administration comprises an IgE 

antibody production inhibitor as an active ingredient, 
and a process for producing an anti-allergic 

pharmaceutical composition for ophthalmic topical 
administration comprises mixing an IgE antibody production 

inhibitor with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, 
excipient or diluent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anti-allergic 
pharmaceutical composition for ophthalmic topical 
administration. Specifically, the present invention relates 
to an anti-allergic pharmaceutical composition for ophthalmic 
topical administration comprising an IgE antibody production 
inhibitor. Allergic reactions include four types of reactions, 
i.e., types I, II, III and IV. The type I (immediate-type, 
anaphylactic) allergic reaction is associated with 
immunoglobulin E (hereinafter referred to as an IgE antibody). 
The reaction steps can be divided roughly into the following 
three steps. The first step is a sensitization step involving 
IgE antibody production and binding of the resulting IgE 
antibodies to mast cells or basophils. The second step 
involves degranulation of the mast cells or basophils and 
release of chemical mediators. The third steps involves onset 
of effects of the released chemical mediators on the target 
organs. Thus, the type I allergic reaction against foreign  
 
antigens leads to onset of symptoms through the above reaction 
steps. Only symptomatic treatments by inhibiting the above 
second and/or third reaction steps have been carried out to 
treat allergic diseases. That is, the treatments are carried 
out by inhibiting the release of chemical mediators 
accompanying the degranulation and/or by inhibiting allergic 
reactions induced by the released chemical mediators. These 
symptomatic treatments have been known to be effective not 
only in systemic administration of antiallergic agents but 
also in topical administration of them to eyes or the like. 
However, the effects of the treatments are limited because the 
treatments do not inhibit IgE antibody production which is the 
basic first step of the type I allergic reaction. As fundamental remedies against the type I allergic 
reaction, medicaments inhibiting the above first step, namely 
IgE antibody production inhibitors are being developed. 
Examples of such inhibitors include (±)-{2-[4-(3-ethoxy-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenylcarbamoyl]ethyl}-dimethylsulfonium 
p-toluenesulfonate 
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as 
suplatast tosilate), ethyl 2,6-bis-(N-methylcarbamoyl)-pyridine-4-carboxylate 
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as 
CS-1433) and the like. Anti-allergic effects of them in 
systemic administration, namely oral administration and the 
like have been reported (U.S. 4,556,737, New Current, Vol. 3,  
 
No. 26 (1992) etc. for suplatast tosilate; Allergy, Vol. 36, 
No. 8 (1987) etc. for CS-1433). However,
