<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
virus-like particles which are useful as vaccines and 
immunogens. In particular, the instant invention 
concerns assembled rotaviral structural proteins and the 
use of the assembly in preventing and ameliorating 
rotaviral infection. Rotaviruses cause gastrointestinal disorders 
and diarrhea in a wide variety of avian and mammalian 
species, including man. Several serotypes of rotavirus 
have been identified, four of which (serotypes 1 to 4) 
are found in humans and five of which (serotypes 3 to 7) 
are found in other animals. Recent studies indicate that 
cross protection among strains belonging to different 
serotypes may occur in animals including man. Ijaz et 
al., J Virol (1990) (In Press); Flores et al., J Clin 
Microbiol (1989) 27:512-518. The rotavirus genome is 
thought to consist of eleven segments of double-stranded 
RNA. The eleven genes encode the production of at least 
six structural proteins of the virus. In complete virus 
particles, these six proteins occur in a double-shelled 
arrangement. The outer shell or capsid is comprised of 
three proteins--virus protein 7 (VP7), virus protein 4  
 
(VP4), and a third protein which has not yet been well 
characterized. There are three inner shell proteins 
designated virus protein 1 (VP1), virus protein 2 (VP2), 
and virus protein 6 (VP6). VP7 is the major outer shell glycoprotein with 
an approximate molecular mass of 38 kD in its unreduced 
form (as determined by SDS-PAGE) and 42 kD in its reduced 
form (as determined by SDS-PAGE). VP7 has approximately 
325 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of several 
rotavirus isolates has been determined and the sequences 
are approximately 75 to 86% homologous. Regions of 
conservation among human and animal species have been 
reviewed by Estes, M.K. et al., Microbiol Rev (1989) 
53:410-449. This protein is known to bind to host cells 
(Sabara, M. et al., J Virol (1985) 53:58-66). Epitope 
mapping of VP7 using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies 
has localized a neutralizing-absorption domain to a 
component peptide with an approximate molecular mass of 
14 kD (Sabara, M. et al., supra). Synthetic peptides 
derived from within this 14 kD fragment have also been 
shown to neutralize viral infectivity (Ijaz et al., 
supra). A second outer capsid protein, VP4 (formerly 
designated VP3), is composed of 776 amino acids and has 
an approximate molecular mass of 82 kD in its unreduced 
form and 84 kD in its reduced form. The sequence of 
bovine VP4 has been
