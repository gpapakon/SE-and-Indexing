<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a projector (1) with at least one object lens (2), a carriage (3) movable approximately parallel to the optical axis of the object lens (2) from a first operative position (projection position) to a second operative position (change position) by a carriage drive (4, 5, 6, 7) inside the projector, said carriage having at least one support (slide carrier (11)) for an image to be projected and a focussing drive especially with an automatic focussing device (12). To simplify the construction of such a projector and especially to reduce the effort required for adjustment, the focussing drive is formed by the carriage drive (4, 5, 6, 7). Here it is of especial advantage if the carriage drive (4, 5, 6, 7) takes the form of a traction drive with a variable transmission ratio, preferably via a cam drive (8, 20).

<CLAIMS>
Projector (1) with at least one projection lens (2), 
with a carriage (3) which is associated with the 

projection lens (2), can be caused to travel inside 
the projector, approximately parallel to the optical 

axis of the projection lens (2), out of a projection 
position and into a slide-changing position by a 

carriage drive (4, 5, 6, 7), and has a mounting (11) 
for an image pattern to be projected; and with a 

focusing drive, particularly with an autofocus 
arrangement (12), 
characterised by
 only one single 
drive which simultaneously forms the focusing drive 

and also the carriage drive (4, 5, 6, 7). 
Projector (1) according to claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 the carriage drive (4, 5, 6, 7) comprises a gear 
unit which has a transmission ratio that is variable 

in dependence upon the path of travel of the carriage 
(3). 
Projector (1) according to claim 2, 
characterised in 
that
 the gear unit (8, 20, 21) has an infinitely 
variable transmission ratio. 
Projector (1) according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised 
in that
 the carriage drive (4, 5, 6, 7) also comprises 
an arrangement for detecting relative changes in 

position of the carriage (3). 
Projector (1) according to claim 4, 
characterised in 
that
 the arrangement comprises a counting dial (15) 
that has a ratio, between the change in position 

detected and the extent of travel of the carriage (3), 
that is variable in a manner corresponding to the 

transmission ratio.  
 
Projector (1) according to one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised in that
 the carriage drive 
comprises an electric motor (4) with a drive cord 

pulley (5) or the like and a traction means gear unit, 
the electric motor (4) and a deflecting roller (7) of 

the traction means gear unit being disposed in a 
stationary manner in the projector (1). 
Projector (1) according to claim 6, 
characterised in 
that
 the traction means gear unit also has a focus 
wheel (8) which can be rotated about a spindle (17) 

fixedly connected to the carriage (3), is wrapped 
around by the traction means and is fitted to the 

spindle (17) in such a way that rotation of the focus 
wheel (8) about the spindle (17) does not take place 

until the carriage (3) is located in its projection 
position. 
Projector (1) according to claim 7, 
characterised in 
that
 the focus wheel (8) can be rotated against the 
force of a restoring spring when the carriage (3) is 

located in its projection position. 
Projector (1) according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterised 
in that
 the focus wheel (8) is constructed as a cord 
pulley. 
Projector (1) according to one of claims 7 to 9, 

characterised in that
, when the carriage (3) is 
located in its projection position, the focus wheel 

(8) is supported with the aid of a control element 
(20) on a stop (21) disposed in a stationary manner in 

the projector (i). 
Projector (1) according to claim 10, 
characterised in 
that
 the control element is a cam disc (20).  
 
Projector (1) according to claim 11, 
characterised in 
that
 the outer contour of the cam disc (20) 
essentially has the shape of an Archimedes' spiral. 
Projector (1) according to claim 11 or 12,
characterised in that
 the focus wheel (8) is the cam 
disc (20). 
Projector (1) according to claim 11 or 12,
characterised in that
 the cam disc (20) is disposed 
axially on the focus wheel (8).
