<ABSTRACT>
Improved fishing lure having the general shape of a fish, including a head (2) and a tail (3) linked by a central flexible link (4) which includes slats (6) arranged symmetrically on either side of them and each forming an acute angle open towards the said head (2), the envelope of the free edges of these slats being the image of the skin of the fish. Each slat (6) includes a notch (5) substantially towards the middle of its periphery. All these notches (5) are arranged on a line representing the lateral line of a fish. Application to fishing, especially to spinning, for jiggling, free or guided.

<CLAIMS>
An improved flexible bait for fishing, especially for casting, dapping, 
releasing and handling, having the general shape of a fish, comprising a head (2) 

and a tail (3) connected by a flexible central strip (4) comprising fins (6) disposed 
symmetrically on either side of it and each forming an acute angle open towards 

the head (2), the outline of the free edges of the scales (6) being in the shape of 
the fish's skin, characterised in that each scale (6) is formed with a notch (5) 

substantially in the region of the middle of its periphery. 
An improved bait according to claim 1, characterised in that all the notches 
(5) are disposed along a line representing the lateral line of a fish. 
An improved bait according to claim 1, characterized in that the tail (3) of 
the bait comprises a set of scales (6) joined to one another so as to constitute a 

block forming an unbalance. 
An improved bait according to claim 1, characterised in that the scales (6) 
all have the same thickness. 
An improved bait according to claim 4, characterized in that the space 
between each pair of successive scales (6) is between once and twice the 

thickness of a scale. 
An improved bait according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
it comprises a longitudinal duct (7) extending from the head (2) to the tail (3) along 

the longitudinal axis of symmetry of the bait (1).
