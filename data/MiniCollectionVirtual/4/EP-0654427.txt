<ABSTRACT>
The belt conveyor is composed of a continuous conveyor belt mounted on a chassis composed of at least three elements (4,5,6) which are articulated together and on the carrier vehicle (1). The last element (6) and, possibly, the preceding one (5) are telescopic, which permits great flexibility in the choice of the tipping-out point, even where space is limited.

A conveyor for use on a vehicle carrying a
container for granular or powder products, the container

having a tipping orifice, and being for example a
concrete mixer, including:


a frame made up of at least three rigid members
(4, 5, 6) hinged together about parallel horizontal axes,

a first of these members (4) having means enabling it to
pivot on a vertical axis fixed relative to the vehicle

and near the tipping point of the container, and the last
of these frame members (6) carrying a tipping chute or

hopper at its end,
rams (7, 8, 11) adapted to act on the hinges and
between the vehicle (1) and the first frame member (4) to

move the frame from a transport position in which it is
folded with the first frame member and possibly the last

frame member vertical or steeply inclined to the vertical
and in which the conveyor does not project significantly

from the exterior profile of the vehicle, to a working
position in which the tipping chute or hopper is moved

away from the vehicle,
a continuous conveyor belt (14) guided by rollers
(15) mounted on the frame and disposed at least at each

end of the frame and near each hinge, one of the rollers
being a base drive roller, and
means for maintaining the conveyor belt at a
substantially constant tension,
 
   characterised in that at least the last frame member

(6) is telescopic and can be extended beyond a maximal
length imposed by the profile of the vehicle when the

frame is in the transport position.
A conveyor according to claim 1 characterised in
that at least one other frame member (5) is also

telescopic.
A conveyor according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that the telescopic movement of the last

member is driven by a hydraulic ram.
A conveyor according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that the telescopic movement of the last

member is driven by a cable and a rotary hydraulic motor.
A conveyor according to claim 1 or claim 2
characterised in that the telescopic movement of the last

member is driven by a rack and toothed pinion driven by a
rotary hydraulic motor.
A conveyor according to any one of claims 1 to 5
wherein the last member has a front section (22) and a

rear section (20) nearer the preceding member,
characterised in that the return run of the conveyor belt

passes successively over an idler roller (31) attached to
the front section which diverts said return run

approximately 180° and then over another idler roller
(29) attached to the rear section which again diverts the

return run approximately 180°.
