Patent Application Serial No . 5 07/810 , 588 filed December 19 , 1991 , (attorney Docket No .M49O1/4902 ) , Serial No. 07/774 , 430 filed October 10 , 1991 (attorney Docket No. M 5087) and Serial No . 07/876 , 967 filed April 30 , 1992 (attorney Docket No . M 5087A) , the disclosures of each of which are hereby incorporated by 10 reference .Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a process for preparing high-detergency alkylpolyglycoside compositions and a purified alkyl monoglycoside and to compositions 15 t employing the alkylpolyglycosides for various end-use applications . In particular, the invention, involves removal or separation of a substantial portion of the alkyl monoglycoside present in a reaction product mixture* containing alkyl polyglycosides resulting from the ^ 20 reaction of an alcohol and a saccharide at elevated* temperatures in the presence of an acid catalyst. This invention further relates to the preparation of novel alkylpolyglycoside compositions having unexpectedly 

 enhanced surfactant properties from readily available mixtures of alkylpolyglycosides of differing alkyl chain lengths, varying degrees of polymerization (DP) and surfactant properties. This invention further relates to the preparation of novel, economical and environmentally friendly mixtures of alkylpolyglycosides of preselected average alkyl chain length, and controlled average DP, for a wide variety of surfactant uses in personal care, cosmetic, detergent, as well as other household and industrial uses.Statement of Related ArtThe reaction of a reducing saccharide, e.g. an aldose or ketose saccharide, or a source thereof, with an alcohol results in the formation of a glycoside. Acids catalyze the reaction between a reducing saccharide and an alcohol. When the alcohol is an alkanol, the resulting glycoside is commonly referred to as an alkyl glycoside. Alkyl glycosides are structurally stable to alkali. Long chain, higher, alkyl (C8_18) groups contribute to surface activity, e.g. detergency, of the glycoside. Thus, long chain alkyl monoglycosides and mixtures thereof with long chain alkyl polyglycosides are known materials, are known to be surface active in character and are known to be useful in a wide variety of household and industrial applications. It is also known that glycoside surfactants can be prepared by reacting a long chain alcohol with a saccharide reactant (e.g.,

 amounts in which the amount by weight of polyglycoside having a DP of 2, or mixtures thereof with the polyglycoside having a DP of 3, predominate in the composition and having an s HLB in the range of about 10 to about 16 and an average DP of at least about 1.8 and at least 0.2 units higher than the average DP of the reaction mixture before separation of the alkyl monoglycoside. 117. A method as defined in claim 116 wherein the alkylpolyglycoside after separation of the monoglycoside from the polyglycoside has an average within the trapezoidal area ABCDE of Figure 4.
118. A method as defined in claim 116, and further comprising mixing the non-Flory distribution alkylpolyglycoside resulting in step (b) with at least one other glycoside component having a different average alkyl chain length.
119. A method as defined in claim 118 wherein said other glycoside component has an average alkyl chain length less than the average alkyl chain length of the non-Flory distribution alkyl polyglycoside resulting in step (b) .
120. A method as defined in claim 118 wherein the non- Flory distribution alkylpolyglycoside is at least a binary component and the other glycoside component is an at least binary component and each of the binary components are present in the mixture in an amount to provide an alkylpolyglycoside composition with an average carbon chain length of about 9 to about 14 and an HLB in the range of about 10 to about 14.
121. A method as defined in claim 120 in which one of the at least binary components is a mixture of a C
12
 alkylpolyglycoside, a C
14
 alkylpolyglycoside and a
C
16
 alkylpolyglycoside and the other at least binary component is a mixture of a C
8
 alkylpolyglycoside 


 and a C
10
 alkylpolyglycoside. 122. A method as defined in claim 121 in which the ratio by weight of the C
8
 and C
10
 alkylpolyglycoside component to the mixture of the C
12
, C
14
 and C
16
 alkylpolyglycoside component is from about 1:1 to about 10:1. 123. A method as defined in claim 122 in which the ratio is about 1:1 to about 4:1.
