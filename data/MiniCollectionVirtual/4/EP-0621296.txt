<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic
polyesters containing perfluoropolyoxyalkylene sequences,
and the preparation process thereof. More particularly, the
present invention relates to thermoplastic polyesters
consisting of flexible blocks having a perfluoropoly-oxyalkylene
structure alternated with rigid blocks having
aromatic, aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic structure, and the
preparation process thereof.It is known from US Patent 3,810,874 a broad class of
fluorinated polymers containing perfluoropolyoxyalkylene
sequences of formula:
-CF2O-(CF2CF2O)m-(CF2O)n-CF2-
where m/n = 0.2-5, linked each other by non-fluorinated
monomeric units. To this class belong the polyesters
obtainable by polycondensation of a perfluoropolyoxyalkylene
corresponding to formula (II), functionalized at both ends
with a -OH group, with a bicarboxylic acid or an non-fluorinated
derivative thereof. Such polymers are endowed
with high flexibility at low temperatures, with glass
transition temperature (Tg) values lower than -78°C. They can 
be used as sealing agents or for the manufacture of sealing
elements to be employed under severe conditions, for
instance in the aerospace field.As illustrated in the above US patent 3,810,874, which
is herein incorporated by reference, the perfluoropolyoxyalkylene
diols of formula:
HO-CH2-CF2O-(CF2CF2O)m-(CF2O)n-CF2-CH2-OH
are preparable by reducing the diacylfluorides of formula:
FCO-CF2O-(CF2CF2O)m-(CF2O)n-CF2-COF.
with lithium and aluminium hydride.The bridging group between perfluoropolyoxyalkylene
chain and -OH groups can be in its turn modified, for
instance by ethoxylation reaction with ethylene oxide from
which diols of formula:
H(OCH2CH2)sOCH2-CF2O-(CF2CF2O)m-(CF2O)n-CF2-CH2-O(CH2CH2O)sH,
where s is a number comprised between 1 and 3, are obtained.As known, perfluoropolyoxyalkylenes having -COF end
groups, and therefore the diols deriving therefrom, are
indeed perfluoropolyoxyalkylene mixtures in which the
bifunctional products are mixed to monofunctional products,
wherein one terminal is a functional group, while the other
terminal is a perfluoroalkyl group having 1 or 2 carbon
atoms, or also to small amounts of non-functionalized
products, wherein both terminals are of perfluoroalkyl type. This fact is an unavoidable consequence of the method
for preparing such products, which, as well known, consists
in submitting to photooxidation tetrafluoroethylene under
ultraviolet radiations, as described for instance in GB-1,217,871
and US-3,715,378 patents, and subsequent
