(56); at least one protrusion (118) on the flexible first 
layer (56) that has an electrical contact (100); a second 

layer (54) having at least one electrical contact (134); 
and a spring device (124) coupled to the flexible first 

layer (56) and to the second layer (54) for pressing the 
electrical contact (100) on a protrusion (118) on the 

flexible first layer (56) to the electrical contact (134) 
on the second layer (54) to electrically connect the 

electrical contact (100) on the protrusion (118) to the 

electrical contact (134) on the second layer (54). In a 
specific embodiment the spring device (124) for pressing 

the electrical contact (100) on the protrusion (118) of 
the flexible first layer (56) to the electrical contact 

(134) on the second layer (54) includes relief device 
(132) for allowing the flexible first layer (56) to

alternate specific embodiment the electrical contacts

layer (56) and the corresponding electrical contacts 
(134) on the second layer (54) are coated with gold. In 

another alternate specific embodiment the improved 
electrical interconnect system includes an alignment 

apparatus coupled to the flexible first layer (56) and 
the second layer (54) and the spring device (124) for 

aligning the flexible first layer (56) with the second

increased reliability compared to conventional 
interconnect systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical interconnect
apparatus and more particularly to electrical interconnect
apparatus between a flexible circuit and a printed circuit
board.While the present invention is described herein with
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular
applications, it should be understood that the invention is
not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in the
art and access to the teachings provided herein will
recognize additional modifications, applications, and
embodiments within the scope of
the present invention as defined by the claims.Electrical interconnections between parts of an
electronic system are often made with flexible circuits,
which are conventionally made with a polyester or polyimid
material such as a Mylar® or Kapton® substrate onto which
multiple conductors are deposited. It is often necessary
to interconnect the electrical contacts on a flexible
circuit to electrical contacts on a rigid printed circuit
board. A high interconnect density, which is the number of
interconnects per square area, is very desirable, because
miniaturization of electronics is increasing requiring
higher interconnect density. There are a number of conventional approaches to
accomplish the interconnection between a flexible circuit
and a printed circuit board. One conventional approach is
to simply solder the flexible circuit to the printed
circuit board (PCB). This approach, however, has the
disadvantages of: 1) low interconnect density, because it
is necessary to maintain the spacing between interconnects
to prevent solder bridging, and 2) the need to use Kapton,
which is more tolerant to heat than Mylar. With this
technique assembly and disassembly are inconvenient.A second conventional approach is to solder a
connector to the flexible circuit for connection with a
connector soldered onto the PCB. This approach is easy to
assemble and disassemble, but requires a connector on both
the printed circuit board and the flexible circuit. In
addition it requires a stiffener to be attached to the
flexible circuit to support the connector, which increases
the cost. It also has the disadvantage of achieving only
low interconnect density.A third conventional approach uses high pressure to
force the flat contacts of a flexible circuit onto the
contacts of a printed circuit board. This approach has the
disadvantage that a rigid structure is required to support
the high pressure and this approach is limited in that it
requires the contacts on the PCB to be above the surface of
the PCB.
