<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to modification of resin 
raw materials, resins and rubbers - such as polymerizable 
monomers, polyurethane resins, polyester resins, 
amino resins, paint resins, adhesive resins, paper 
coating resins, fiber processing resins, foaming 
resins, molding resins and laminates, and specifically 
to diguanamines and their derivatives and polymeric microspheres, 
which are useful as flame retardants, heat 
stabilizers, compatibility improvers or the like for 
resins. This invention is also concerned with applications 
of such flame retardants, heat stabilizers and 
compatibility improvers. In general, resins have excellent properties such 
as high strength, chemical resistance, abrasion 
resistance, weatherability, durability and dyeability 
and, as molded, extruded or otherwise formed resin products, 
are employed in a wide range of industrial 
fields such as construction material industry, electrical 
material industry, vehicle, e.g., automotive 
vehicle material industry, fiber material industry and  
 
utensil industry. These resins are however accompanied by the drawback 
that they are extremely flammable. Keeping step 
with their extensive use, there is the significantly 
increasing tendency that they become a predominant 
cause in fires. A high standard has hence been imposed 
on the safety of these industrial materials. It is 
therefore desired to improve these resins' properties 
such as flame retardancy and heat resistance. Further, these resins also tend to undergo 
deterioration under heat, light or the like. It is 
therefore desired to improve the thermal stability of 
the resins and also to improve or impart other 
properties without impairing the inherent good 
properties of these resins. It is an extremely important 
assignment to the industry to modify such resins 
and also to develop new materials. With a view to improving the flame retardancy of 
such resins, a variety of methods has been proposed to 
date. Known methods include, for example, addition of 
a flame retardant, mixing with a flame-retardant resin, 
use of a flame-retardancy-imparting material (monomer) 
upon production of a resin to incorporate the material 
in the skeleton of the resin, and application of post  
 
treatment to a resin to impart flame retardancy. Among 
these methods, it is generally often practiced to add a 
flame retardant to a resin. Known examples of such a 
flame retardant include halogen-containing compounds, 
phosphorus-containing compounds, inorganic compounds 
and
