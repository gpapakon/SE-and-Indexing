<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to active 
noise control systems, for example an active 
noise control system with detouring sound apparatus which 
eliminates noise by taking into consideration 
the fact that the sound generated from a sound generation 
device to eliminate noise from a noise source indirectly 
reaches the noise source. The environment has become a major social issue 
in recent years. Noise is also becoming a social issue 
because it is detrimental to the living and working 
environments and has an adverse effect on health. 
Recently, so-called "active noise eliminator" which not 
only eliminate noise by absorbing it but also eliminate 
it by generating sound waves having the same amplitude, 
but an opposite phase to, the waveforms of the noise to 
cancel the noise has attracted increasing attention. 
There is a strong demand for an active noise eliminator 
which can be applied to all types of apparatuses and 
equipments generating noise, such as electrical home 
appliances and computer systems and which can eliminate 
noise efficiently and economically. In a cooling and silencing control system for a 
large high-speed computer system which cools the computer 
system by blowing cool air, cool air is blown from a 
cooling apparatus below a free-access floor. A cooling 
control system sucks this cooling air into a duct by a 
fan and exhausts it through the duct. In this way, the 
heat generated from heat sources such as the printed 
circuit boards of the computer is guided to and exhausted 
through the duct. The cooling control system controls  
 
the cooling by changing the rotational speed of the fan 
in accordance with the temperature. In the case of small 
computers, room temperature air is caused to flow through 
the heat sources such as the printed circuit boards 
instead of cool air. In either case, an active noise 
cancelling controller (ANCC) drives a sound generation 
device such as a speaker based on the noise from the fan 
(fan noise) received by sensor microphone and fan noise 
received by an error microphone remaining after noise 
cancellation (residual noise) so as to generate sound 
waves having the same amplitude as but an opposite phase 
to the fan noise. The fan noise is cancelled out by the 
sound generated from the speaker (speaker sound) to thus 
actively eliminate the fan noise. The fan noise received by the sensor 
microphone, that is, the microphone disposed in the 
proximity of the cooling fan (noise source) for cooling 
the printed circuit boards, etc, is converted
