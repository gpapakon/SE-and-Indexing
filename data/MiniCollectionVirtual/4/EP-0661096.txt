<ABSTRACT>
A honeycomb heater comprising a honeycomb structure 
which is made of a conductive material and which has a number 

of passages substantially parallel to a gas flow direction 
partitioned by partition walls and which has both end surfaces 

on a gas inlet side and a gas outlet side, and at least two 
electrodes for electrification provided on the honeycomb 

structure, said honeycomb heater being characterized in that a 
catalyst layer is supported on the partition walls so as to 

cover them; resistance is adjusted so that a specific region 
including at least a gas inlet side end surface neighborhood 

may be locally heated more quickly as compared with the other 
region at the time of the electrification; and the area of the 

specific region which is locally quickly heated is in the 
range of 5 to 50% of the sectional area of a gas passage. 

According to the present invention, harmful substances in an 
exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion engine, 

particularly HC generated in large quantities at the time of a 
cold start can be effectively purified with a low electric 

power.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical heating
type honeycomb heater and its operation method which can
suitably be used in an exhaust gas purification system for
effectively purifying harmful components such as hydrocarbons
(HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in an
exhaust gas exhausted from an internal combustion engine,
particularly HC generated in large quantities at the time of
an engine start (at a cold start).Heretofore, the research and development of an automobile
exhaust gas purification system for purifying harmful
components such as HC, CO and NOx in an exhaust gas of a car
have been actively carried out, but particularly in recent
years, the purification of these harmful substances at a cold
start of a car has been an important technical theme with the
intensification of exhaust gas regulations.That is to say, when the temperature of such an exhaust
gas as exhausted immediately after the start of an engine is 
low, a catalyst does not reach its functional temperature, and
so the purification ability of the catalyst is poor. In
addition, at this time, HC are exhausted in a larger amount
than at the time of a steady running.As one means for solving such a technical problem, much
attention has been paid to a technique in which an electrical
heating type heater is electrified before or simultaneously
with the start of the engine to quickly heat the catalyst
supported on the heater, the so-called light-off catalyst and
main catalyst and the like closely arranged in the rear of the
heater up to the functional temperature of the catalysts.For example, EP-A-452125
which has been filed by the present applicant
discloses a resistance adjustable type heater in which at
least two electrodes for electrification are attached to a
honeycomb structure having a number of passages, and a
resistance adjusting means comprising slits or the like is
provided between the electrodes.Furthermore, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No.
138042/1993 is concerned with a heating type metal carrier
catalyst in which consumed power is limited, and this patent
application describes a local heating type heater having, on
the inlet side of an exhaust gas, a portion where the 
resistance of a conductive route of a metal carrier locally
increases. In this disclosed invention, the resistance in the
local heating portion can be adjusted by forming an orifice or
a slit in the heater or changing the wall thickness of a metal
foil constituting a metal carrier.In addition, Japanese Patent Application
