<ABSTRACT>
A concentrated aqueous surfactant solution comprising alkyl ether sulphate and alkaline earth metal, preferably magnesium. The composition is a stable liquid which is suitable for making into cleaning products, especially dish washing liquids. The concentrated surfactant solution can be prepared by partial neutralisation of the acid precursor with the hydroxide or oxide of the alkaline earth metal, followed by a further neutralisation with the hydroxide of an alkali metal or ammonium.

<DESCRIPTION>
CONCENTRATED LIQUID DETERGENT COMPOSITION COMPRISING AN ALKYL ETHER SULPHATE AND A PROCESS FOR MAKING THE COMPOSITIONBackground of the InventionRecent trends in the detergent industry have been towards delivering a more concentrated product to the consumer. This has the benefits of both smaller and lighter bottles, boxes etc. for the consumer to handle, as well as lowering the requirement for packaging materials. Decreasing the packaging materials in turn reduces the load on waste disposal into the environment.With this in mind it has been the goal of detergents manufacturers to produce raw materials which have a higher concentration of active detergent ingredients. This goal challenges the manufacturers to formulate, and develop processes for, compositions which are increasingly concentrated, but still stable over a period of time.This invention provides a stable concentrated aqueous or aqueous/alcohol solution of an alkyl ether sulphate useful as a component in formulating cleaning products especially dish washing liquids. 

 The solution contains alkaline earth metal ions, which are known to boost performance of dish washing formulations, but very few or no chloride or sulphate ions, which have a detrimental effect on the stability of concentrated solutions and on finished products made from said concentrated solutions.The invention also describes a two-stage neutralising process for making such compositions.The composition may be used as a finished product in its own right, but preferably it will be mixed with other ingredients to produce a finished product. It is intended that the sulphating/neutralising processes may be carried out at locations remote from the sites were the finished product is blended. This allows for economical and flexible manufacturing and transportation.The use of magnesium cations as performance boosters in dish washing liquids for at least part of the anionic surfactant has been widely disclosed in the prior art, for example, British patent numbers 1 524 441 and l 551 074 and British published patent application 2 010 893.US 4133779, published on January 9th, 1979, discloses a detergent composition comprising anionic and nonionic semipolar surfactants. It suggests that a concentrated liquid/paste containing from 45% to 95% active surfactant (which can be alkyl ether sulphate) can be made. Neutralisation by magnesium hydroxide is one of a number of options, but no process details are given, and no incentive to avoid chloride or sulphate ions is suggested. Indeed addition of
