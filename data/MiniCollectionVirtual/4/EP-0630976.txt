<ABSTRACT>
A process for the direct production of sponge iron particles and liquid pig iron from iron ore pellets is described, in which the iron ore is reduced as a loose fill (bed) in a direct-reduction unit by means of hot reduction gases to give sponge iron and is then smelted, in a smelting gasifier, by means of introduced carbon and injected oxygen-containing gas, reduction gas being generated at the same time. At least a portion of the reduction gas, having been cooled to the temperature required for the reduction, is passed into the reduction zone of the direct-reduction unit. A considerable fraction of the carbon and of the reduction gas is due to the initial presence of a mixture of hydrocarbon-containing plastic and petroleum coke and/or coke (breeze). The reduction gases are primarily produced, at least in part, by cracking (from the plastic) and by thermal gasification (from the coke).

Process for producing molten pig iron from iron oxide pellets, in
which the iron oxide is in a direct reduction unit reduced as loose bulk by means

of hot reduction gases into iron sponge which is subsequently molten in a melt-down
gasifier by means of fed carbon and blown in oxygen containing gas whilst

producing a reduction gas, and at least a portion of the reduction gas is, after
cooling down to reduction temperature, introduced into the reduction zone of the

direct reduction unit, 
characterised in that
 the carbon is delivered to the melt-down
gasifier in the form of coal and to a substantial extent up to 60% in the form

of plastic and petrolic coke, and their ratio is matched in such a manner that the
properties of their mixture relative to volatile components are similar to a high-volatile

coal, and the reduction gas is primarily obtained by cracking from the
plastic material and by thermal gasification from the petrolic coke.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the plastic as
CO- and H2 producer and the petrolic coke or coke as CO-producer represents the

controlled condition for production of the reduction gas components.
Process according to Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the
proportion of plastic and/or petrolic coke is preselected in dependence of the coal

quality and the sulfur content of the petrolic coke as well as the coal.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the
ratio plastic/petrolic coke is matched to the sulfur content of the petrolic coke and

the content of volatile components of the coal. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the
proportion of plastic in the mixture is chosen in such a manner that at least a

considerable volume of gas as obtained in the melt-down gasifier can be ducted
via the reduction unit.
Process according to Claims 1 and 4, 
characterised in that
 the
petrolic coke content in the coal mixture is chosen in dependence of the sulfur

content of the petrolic coke or the required quantity of flux which bonds the
sulfur.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 into the top part
of the gasifier is delivered a sufficient volume of oxygen, carbondioxide and

water-vapour containing gases so as to prevent soot from forming during
decomposition of the plastic material.
