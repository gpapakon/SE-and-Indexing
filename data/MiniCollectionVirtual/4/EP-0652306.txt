<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrolytes based upon lower
alkyl or alkylol sulfonic acids or their derivatives for the
high speed electroplating of tin, lead, or tin/lead alloys,
particularly those for use in high speed electroplating
equipment.Electroplating baths for depositing tin, lead, or their
alloys have been used for many years in electroplating
equipment. High speed electroplating equipment and processes
are well-known in the industry and generally consist of
directing the work to be plated into the electroplating cell
from one end, allowing the work to proceed through the
electroplating cell and exit thereafter the cell at the other
end. The electroplating solution is removed or overflows the
electroplating cell into a reservoir and the solution is
pumped from the reservoir back into the electroplating cell to
provide vigorous agitation and solution circulation. Many
variations of these electroplating cells can exist, but the
general features are as described.There are a number of desirable features that the
electroplating solution should possess for improved operation
in this type of equipment or processing, as follows:
1. The solution must be able to electroplate the
desired alloy deposit at the high speeds required.2. The deposit should be lustrous and fine grained,
even at the high current densities required for high
speed plating.3. The deposit should have good solderability and be
capable of meeting the solderability requirements
specified for such deposits.4. The solution should be stable and the additives must 
withstand exposure to the strong acid solution as
well as to the introduction of air which would take
place as a result of the Vigorous solution movement
in high speed plating machines. 5. The solution should remain clear and free from
turbidity, even at elevated temperatures such as
120-130°F or higher. Due to the high current
densities involved and relatively low solution
volumes, these baths tend to heat up in high speed
electroplating equipment until the solution reaches
equilibrium at an elevated temperature. The
additives used must be of a type that will not turn
the solution turbid at such elevated temperatures.6. Because of vigorous solution movement and solution
mixing with air, there is a strong tendency to
produce a foam which is detrimental to the
electroplating process. Under extreme conditions,
this foam can build up in the reservoir tank with
resultant overflow onto the floor, thereby losing a
large quantity of solution to the waste stream. In
some applications of

An electrolyte for high speed electroplating tin, lead or a tin/lead
alloy which comprises:


a basis solution of an alkyl sulfonic acid;
a solution soluble tin compound and/or a solution soluble lead
compound; and
a surfactant of an organic compound having at least one
hydroxyl group and 20 carbon atoms or less condensed with an

alkylene oxide compound, or a solution soluble derivative thereof,
said organic compound being a one or two ring aromatic compound in

which the aromatic ring system is substituted by the at least one
hydroxyl group and optionally by an alkyl moiety having six or less

the electrolyte being substantially non-foaming when used in high
speed electroplating such that there is no build-up of foam during

electroplating in which the electrolyte substantially fills an
electroplating cell, continuously overflows into a reservoir, and is

continuously returned to the cell, so as to cause vigorous agitation
and circulation of said electrolyte within the cell.

system of the organic compound contains 6-12 carbon atoms.
An electrolyte according to Claim 1, wherein the aromatic
compound is phenol, styrenated phenol, or benzene or naphthalene

derivative of any thereof in which the alkyl moiety has six or less

carbon atoms.

aromatic compound includes an alkyl moiety having six or less carbon

atoms.
