 PAPER SHEET FASTENER FILE AND METHOD OF ASSEMBLYField of the InventionThis invention relates to a new type of paper sheet file assembly and the method of inserting the individual sheets therein.Conventional file folders for holding correspondence and paperwork use a fastening device such as an acco- binder for holding such papers uniformly in a file. The individual sheets are two-hole punched near the top center edge thereof. The acco-binder prongs, also positioned adjacent the top edge of the backing panel of the file, are opened and the two hole punched sheet is then positioned in the file and the holes placed over the prongs. The upstanding prongs are then bent over to secure the sheet in the file.This fastening arrangement is both cumbersome and time-consuming, requiring an individual two-hole punch of each letter, the opening of the acco-binder prongs, the actual positioning of the paper sheet in the file over 

 the prongs, and finally the closing of the prongs to hold the sheet in the file. This cumbersome, and time- consuming procedure must be followed for each and every sheet inserted in the file. This invention makes it possible to avoid this cumbersome procedure, and to rapidly, and accurately place the correspondence in the file, immediately, without any need to adapt the correspondence to be inserted, nor to repeatedly fasten and unfasten holding device such as an acco-binder.With this new arrangement, each sheet is individually held in the position that it would ordinarily have held where a fastening arrangement, such as an acco-binder used. Consequently, the conventional arrangement of a paper sheet file is unchanged, while the time-consuming manual operations heretofore required for placing a sheet in the file are eliminated.Summary of the Invention The new file arrangement of this invention, because it eliminates a number of operational steps formerly required for placing the correspondence in a correspondence file, makes it possible to immediately insert a paper sheet in a file, thereby saving a considerable amount of effort, annoyance, and most of the time formerly required to place a single sheet in a file folder. 

 Further, inasmuch as it is unnecessary to repeatedly open and close metal prong fasteners and similar types of devices, there is more inclination to mount file papers in a fixed organized file arrangement with its organized chronological advantages, rather than to have loose papers in a file folder.A multiple element fastening sheet block initially attached to the file
