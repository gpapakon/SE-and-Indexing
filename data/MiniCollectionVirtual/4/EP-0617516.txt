<ABSTRACT>
A sigma-delta modulator (50, 100) attenuates a frequency 
domain characteristic of a feedback signal to a first stage (60) of 

the modulator (50, 100) near f
S
/2, where f
S
 is the modulator's 
(50, 100) clock frequency. The modulator (50, 100) thus virtually 

eliminates in-band tones which are characteristic of known 
sigma-delta modulators, without complex dithering schemes. In 

one embodiment, the sigma-delta modulator (50, 100) includes a 
two-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filter (80) within a 

feedback loop of the modulator (50, 100). The two-tap FIR filter 
(80) smoothes transitions at an output of a second stage (70) to 

provide the feedback signal to the first stage (60). This 
architecture is useful for either a digital-to-analog sigma-delta 

modulator (50) or an analog-to-digital sigma-delta modulator 
(100).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to data converters, and
more particularly, to sigma-delta modulators for digital-to-analog
or analog-to-digital converters.There are two basic techniques used in data converters.
These are the sigma-delta technique and the resistive or
capacitive divider techniques. The sigma-delta technique is
attractive because it achieves high resolution by precise timing
instead of precisely-matched on-chip components such as
resistors. In addition, the expertise needed to produce thin-film,
laser-trimmed analog components is difficult to obtain; whereas,
high-speed digital switching capability is commonplace in the
semiconductor industry. Sigma-delta modulators may be used in
both analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog
converters (DACs).A basic sigma-delta modulator used in a DAC receives an
input signal which is summed with inverse feedback of the output
signal to provide an error signal. The error signal is attenuated
and then processed through an integrator to provide the output
signal. The sigma-delta modulator is able to shape the
quantization noise out of the passband, where it can be filtered.
A common sigma-delta modulator configuration is the second-order
configuration, as described in Journal of the Audio
Engineering Society, vol. 39, no. 1/2, February 1991, at page 16.
The second-order configuration uses two integrator stages. When
this modulator is used in an ADC, the output of the second
integrator is quantized and the quantized output signal is used to
form a feedback signal which is input to the first two stages.However, sigma-delta modulators are notorious for creating
unwanted tones in the passband. These unwanted tones have 
frequencies which are linearly related to a DC bias of the input
signal. The creation of these unwanted tones is worse for small
input signals which are close to the signal ground level.
Furthermore, during the time when the input signal is close to the
ground level, it is easier for a listener to hear the unwanted
tones. One generally accepted explanation of why sigma-delta
modulators produce these unwanted tones is that the sigma-delta
modulator creates pattern noises in order to resolve small
incremental changes in the input signal. In a second-order sigma-delta
modulator, the single-bit output, which is used as a
feedback signal to two stages, has only a limited number of
patterns to represent the small input signals around the signal
ground level, and thus patterns have a large instantaneous error,
causing the pattern
