<ABSTRACT>
Arranged packings made of plastic are known whose strips have the same cross-section over their length and are joined together via a transverse holder web. The strips are arranged one above the other in a plurality of layers to increase the strip density. In the packing according to the invention, the strips are decreased in cross-section at least in the region of the holder web and preferably immediately to the left and/or right adjacent to the holder web. Thus the strips can be arranged in a layer with increased effective strip density. Packings formed in such a way serve for biological wastewater purification.

Filling material for percolating filters for the
treatment of fluids, especially for biological sewage

purification, with a multiplicity of plastic strips (20)
which are connected to at least one holding web (21)

extending transversely relative to their longitudinal
direction for a hanging arrangement on a carrier device

(28), characterized in that the strips (20) have a
reduced width at least in the regions of the holding web

(21).
Filling material according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the strips (20) have a different

width over their length.
Filling material according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the width of the strips (20)

decreases from the ends of these towards the holding web
(21), the holding web (21) being arranged approximately

centrally between the ends of the strips (20) located
opposite one another.
Filling material according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the width of the strips (20)

decreases at least in the region of the holding web
(21). 
Filling material according to Claim 1,
characterized in that at least one tension-absorbing

strand (individual strand 30, 31) is arranged on at
least one side of the strips (20), the strand or strands

extending in the longitudinal direction of the strips
(20).
Filling material for percolating filters for the
treatment of fluids, especially for biological sewage

purification, with a multiplicity of plastic strips (20)
which are connected to a holding web (21) extending

transversely relative to their longitudinal direction,
characterized in that the holding web (21) is formed

from two parallel part webs (23, 24), the strips (20)
having a reduced width at least in the regions between

the part webs (23, 24) of the holding web (21) and being
connected firmly to said part web (23, 24).
Process for the production of filling material
serving for the treatment of fluids, especially for

biological sewage purification, strips (20) lying next
to one another being formed from a material web (36) and

the strips (20) being connected to at least one
transversely directed holding web (21), characterized in

that the strips (20) are reduced in width at least in
their regions of connection to the holding web (21) or

holding webs (21).
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the strips (20) are treated thermally, especially

with hot air, to reduce the width, the thermal treatment
of the strips (20) being carried out at regular time

intervals. 
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in
that the strips (20) are connected on both sides to the

holding web (21).
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in
that, during the application of the holding web (21),

the strips (20) are separated or marked over the entire
width of the material web (36), in order to delimit the

following filling material.
