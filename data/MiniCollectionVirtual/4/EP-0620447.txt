<ABSTRACT>
A diagnostic medical magnetic resonance 
imaging and quantitative method for use with human and 

veterinary subjects in the diagnostic evaluation of 
normal, altered or diseased status of tissues and 

fluids containing lipids and or proteins by physically 
combining stable xenon and/or stable krypton in lipid 

and lipid containing structures in which they are 
soluble and physically combining stable xenon and/or 

stable krypton in protein structures comprised of 
molecules having nuclei with dipole moments which are 

altered by their physical incorporation of stable xenon 
and/or stable krypton in their structures when exposed 

to a magnetic field thus providing positive contrast 
enhancement to an image produced by magnetic resonance 

and the ability to quantify and measure physiology by 
magnetic resonance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to magnetic
resonance imaging.Recently magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was
commercially introduced to the medical field. MRI is a
three dimensional imaging process. MRI is advantageous
over other imaging procedures such as two dimensional
and three dimensional CT X-ray techniques in that MRI
better defines soft tissue structures. It is also
advantageous over X-ray techniques, because it does not
require the patient being exposed to X-rays.The likelihood of an accurate diagnosis and
assessment of therapeutic impact may be improved in MRI
by the use of a contrast enhancement agent. At
present, only ionic and nonionic forms of gadolinium
based paramagnetic products which must be injected and
so are invasive are authorized for use as a contrast
enhancement agent with MRI. Such agents are not known
to bind or combine with proteins or lipids. Gadolinium
is a highly effective relaxation agent on surrounding
biological fluids or structures and its use has been
authorized to provide contrast enhancement when used
with MRI in those intracranial lesions with abnormal
vascularity or those thought to cause an abnormality in
the blood-brain barrier and to facilitate visualization
of intracranial lesions including but not limited to
tumors. This contrast enhancer is an intravascular
agent and cannot cross the blood-brain barrier unless 
the blood-brain barrier is damaged. It is also
authorized for use in the detection of lesions of the
spine. It is therefore limited in application, and
provides information that is morphological and
anatomical, rather than physiological. Potential side
effects and adverse reactions exist.In EP-A-0 118 281 there is disclosed a method for detecting
gases in an animal using an NMR spectrometer. The gases to be detected in
this prior method itself are not sensitive to nuclear magnetic resonance.
Rather, the gas influences an element which is generally fluorine and which
emits an atypical radio frequency signal indicating the presence of the gas.Recently there has been proposed the use of
stable neon as a contrast enhancement agent for MRI.
This is discussed in U.S. Patent Number 5,046,498.
While the use of stable neon provides certain
advantages for contrast enhancement in carrying out
MRI, its use has certain limitations. Because neon is
not polarizable its use is limited to establishing
reverse contrast. Furthermore, neon is not easily
soluble in lipids, thus requiring that high
concentrations be used and limiting its usefulness to
that of a blood pool
