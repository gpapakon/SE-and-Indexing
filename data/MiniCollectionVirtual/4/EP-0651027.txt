<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to azo dyestuffs of the stilbene series and mixtures thereof, of the
general formula I

wherein:
the two R1independently signify hydrogen or a substituent from the series halogen,
amino, alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, alkylamino, dialkylamino, acylamino, aryl or
aryloxy, or together with R2 or R5 form an optionally substituted
carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring,the two R2independently signify hydrogen or a substituent from the series halogen,
acyl, alkyl, cyano, carboxyl, acylamino, alkyl- resp. phenylsulphonyl,
sulphonic acid or alkoxy, or together with R1, form an optionally substituted
carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring,the two R3independently signify a substituent from the series chlorine, fluorine, alkyl-
or arylsulphonyl, sulphonic acid and optionally further substituted hydroxyl,
mercapto, hydrazino and amino, whereby "further substituted amino"
includes heterocyclic radicals,the two R4independently signify an amino group bearing one or two substituents, or a
N-morpholyl, N-piperazyl or N-piperidyl group,the two R5independently signify hydrogen or an aliphatic (also cycloaliphatic) radical
optionally bearing substituents, or with R1 form an optionally substituted
heterocyclic ring,
and the two M independently signify hydrogen or a monocationic group,
and, apart from the fact that R3 may be chlorine or fluorine, no reactive groups are present.JP-A-60-173062, cf. Chemical Abstracts, 104, 11, Abstr. No. 90481a (1986), describes 
dyestuffs, the central core of which is stilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid, the 4- and 4'- positions of
which are connected via azo bridges to optionally substituted phenylene groups bearing
6-amino-4-halo-2-triazinylamino groups, the 6-amino groups of which are substituted by
phenyl or naphthyl groups which in turn may be substituted and at least one of which bears a
group of formula -SO2-CH=CH2 or -SO2-CH2-CH2-Z wherein Z is a group which can be
removed by the action of alkali. These dyestuffs thus contain three or four reactive groups,
namely a halogen atom on each of the two triazinyl rings plus a group of the formula
-SO2-CH=CH2 or -SO2-CH2-CH2-Z on one or both of the terminal phenyl or naphthyl groups.The dyestuffs according to the present invention which in principle belong to a similar class
of compounds contain no reactive groups at all or at most two reactive groups, see the
optional presence of chlorine or fluorine as R3 on the triazinyl rings and the proviso that "apart
from the fact that R3 may be chlorine or fluorine, no reactive groups are
