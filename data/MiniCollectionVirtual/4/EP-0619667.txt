<ABSTRACT>
Access method to the address characteristics of communicating partners with a first address field when sending data packets. In the invention, a method is described with which address characteristics, in particular those of data packets, can be accessed quickly. The method exploits the fact that service features of the communications link are stored in the form of addresses in tables which need to be searched in succession. A large address field from which only a sub-set of addresses is used is compressed into an address field which is the same size as the sub-set of used addresses. Shortened addresses are thus obtained. Since a plurality of tables need to be searched for each address entry, a second stage of the method according to the invention comprises jumping from the compressed address field via offsets to different tables which need to be checked. The communications load for address transfer is reduced by the method according to the invention and a shorter computing time compared with hash addressing is achieved.
