<ABSTRACT>
A method of coating household and kitchen utensils, especially the bases of frying pans, comprises the steps of:   - making dome-shaped depressions (30) in the surface of a preferably metallic substrate (15), the depressions having a diameter (D) of between 1.0 and 3.0 mm and a depth (t) of between 0.2 and 0.5 mm; - applying at least one thermally sprayed, especially plasma-sprayed, layer (16, 17) to the surface provided with depressions (30), the thickness (d1, d2) of the layer (16, 17) being less than half as great as the depth (t); and - applying a non-stick coating (18) to the thermally sprayed layer (16, 17), the thickness (d3) of the non-stick coating (18) being less than the thickness (d1, d2) of the thermally sprayed layer (16, 17).
