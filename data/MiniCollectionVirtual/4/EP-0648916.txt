<ABSTRACT>
Profile strip made from flexible sealing material, comprising two flat side parts connected by an open hollow channel. The hollow channel can have a U-shaped or polygonal, preferably rectangular, cross-section. The profile strip consists of a dimensionally stable, flexible material with good resistance to water, such as rubber, or of plastic, e.g. plasticised polyvinyl chloride, and can be reinforced by fibre or fabric inlays. It is preferably used in tunnelling for sealing the joints between adjacent lining elements. It is connected to the inside of the tunnel lining by adhesively bonding the flat side parts. The seepage water penetrating through the joint is directed through the hollow channel of the profile on both sides down to the sewers running along the tunnel.

A profiled strip made of flexible sealing material for sealing joints between two
adjacent building elements and for simultaneously carrying away water which penetrates the

joints, which consists of two flat side parts (1) disposed in a plane and of a middle part (3)
which is disposed between the side parts (1) and which forms an open channel (5) which is

arched out of said plane, wherein the middle part (3) is seamlessly and continuously joined
to a side part on each side (1),
characterised in that

in the transition region between the side parts (1) and the middle part (3), the profiled strip
has a recess (4) which starts from each of its faces forming the outside of the channel (5),

which extends in the longitudinal direction, and which reduces the wall thickness of the
profiled strip.
A profiled strip according to claim 1,
characterised in that

the channel (5) has a U-shaped cross-section.
A profiled strip according to claim 1,
characterised in that

the channel (5) has a polygonal cross-section which is preferably rectangular.
A profiled strip according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that

the faces thereof which are intended for fixation by adhesive bonding to components are
provided with ribs (2).
A profiled strip according to at least one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that

it is reinforced with fibres or textile inserts. 
The use of the profiled strip according to any one of the preceding claims in tunnel
construction for joining adjacent components which are employed as lining elements,
characterised in that

the faces of the side parts (1) which adjoin the inside of the channel (5) are adhesively
bonded to edge regions of faces, which face the inside of the tunnel, of two adjacent

building elements separated by a joint, wherein the channel (5) which is open towards the
joint is provided for receiving leakage water which penetrates the joint and for carrying

said water away into underground waste water ducts situated below.
