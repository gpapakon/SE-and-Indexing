<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to printed circuit boards and 
cards, and more particularly to an improved printed circuit 
board design enhancing heat flow through the circuit board to 
heat traps or thermal vents thereby preventing heat build up in 
the circuit board or card. During rework of a circuit board, the process of removing 
components from the board, two conflicting goals must be 
accomplished. First, the proper heat must be maintained to 
allow the solder securing the components to the circuit board 
to reach and remain at the reflow temperature. Secondly, it is 
necessary to prevent the applied heat from dispersing through 
the circuit board to adjacent components and causing 
potentially damaging stress to the circuit board or card and 
components attached thereto. It is common to mount complex electronic components on printed 
boards by inserting pins extending from components into plated 
through holes in the circuit board and soldering them in place. 
The plated through holes normally provide connections between 
the pins and conductive material situated at various levels of 
the circuit board or card. As the number of components attached to the circuit board 
increases, both the number of pins and the number of times the 
board must be heated to solder the pins in place increase. 
Therefore, during rework, a great amount of heat is potentially 
applied to a circuit board or card.  As the circuit board increases in size and thickness, the total 
amount of copper and the number of planes common to a single 
via all contribute to insufficient soldering and the inability 
to rework an assembly. Further, the soldering process is 
adversely effected when tied planes in a circuit board or card, 
that is, planes in the circuit board or card that are 
electrically connected to the through hole, allow heat being 
applied to the plated through hole to escape into the internal 
planes of the circuit board. The escape of heat from the 
through hole reduces the through hole temperature to below the 
solder melting point resulting in insufficient hole fill. The draining of heat from the through hole is especially 
prevalent when two or more planes are common to a single 
through hole. This allows heat to escape into the internal 
planes of the circuit board or card from the plated through 
hole, thereby inhibiting the top surface of the carrier from 
reaching the solder reflow temperature. Thicker circuit boards 
that do not have common power planes also experience rework 
problems. It is also
