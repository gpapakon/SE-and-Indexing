<DESCRIPTION>
 WATER BLOWN FOAMBackground of the InventionThis patent application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 471,857, filed January 29, 1990, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.Urethane foam is used in architectural building panels, siding, shingles, marine floatation, εprayed-on roof materials, and as insulation for the tops of buildings both to prevent leaking and to provide insulation.The Montreal Protocol, an agreement signed by most of the world's developed nations in 1987, pledges to cut the use of chlorofluorocarbons in the production of urethane foam in half by 1998. It is anticipated that this summer the agreement will be strengthened to totally ban the use of chlorfluorocarbons by the year 2000. In addition, Congress has recently increased taxes on chlorofluoroσarbon products. Therefore, alternative sources of foam producing material must be employed. Current replacements for chlorofluorocarbons increase the cost of producing urethane foams. Accordingly, a need currently exists for a low cost method of producing these foams.The subject invention provides a composition which produces a rigid foam when combined with diphenyl ethane diisocyanate. 

The subject invention provides a water blown foam having a commercially valuable density of from, for example, about 0.3 lb/ft3 to about 5 lb/ t3 or more. In summary, the subject invention offers a low cost, environmentally safe alternative to conventional urethane foams. 
«.n*πτma v of the InventionThe subject invention provides a urethane foam which does not require chlorofluorocarbons to manufacture. Two embodiments of this invention are disclosed.The first embodiment is a composition useful for producing a foam which comprises: (a) an oxyalkylated polyol having a hydroxyl number of from about 28 to about 800, (b) a rigid polyether polyol, a polyester polyol or an oxyalkylated bisphenol A, (c) an organic surfactant, (d) an amine catalyst, (e) a polyisocyanate catalyst, and (f) a quaternary ammonium salt or a triazine.The second embodiment is a composition useful for producing a foam which comprises: (a) an oxyalkylated polyol having a hydroxyl number of from about 28 to about 800, (b) a rigid polyether polyol, a polyester polyol or oxyalkylated bisphenol A, (c) a polyalkyleneoxidemethylsiloxane copolymer, (d) an amine catalyst, (e) a polyisocyanurate catalyst, and (f) a quaternary ammonium salt or a triazine.
