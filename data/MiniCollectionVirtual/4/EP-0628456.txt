<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a security system and more 
particularly to a vehicle security system which is adapted for 
use with a second and pre-existing security system, which is 
adapted to be automatically activated and deactivated, and which 
is further adapted to acquire and selectively provide video data. Security systems are normally employed in vehicles 
to prevent theft and damage to the vehicle. Many of these 
systems selectively allow remote or "panic" siren activation if 
a threatening situation is encountered as the owner approaches 
or enters the vehicle. The loud noise emanating from the 
activated siren allows the owner to warn away or frighten 
potential assailants. While these prior systems selectively 
provide such "panic" alarms, they are prone to unintentional and 
undesirable siren activation causing unwanted audio disturbances 
to the surrounding area. Furthermore, many of these systems only allow for 
manual system activation and/or deactivation, requiring the 
vehicle owner to hold and depress certain switches on a 
transmitter. Such manual operation is both inconvenient and 
dangerous. For example, should the owner be carrying a large 
number of grocery bags it becomes necessary for the owner to 
place the bags upon the car or ground while locating and holding 
the transmitter. Moreover, if the owner is being pursued and 
must enter the vehicle quickly, the need to locate and depress 
certain transmitter switches might cause the owner to fail to 
evade the pursuers.  Moreover, many of these prior systems provide only 
limited alarm functionality, thereby successfully preventing or 
deterring only a relatively small number of thefts while being 
easily disconnected or deactivated by a thief and providing an 
alarm only when the vehicle has actually been damaged. Many of these prior system limitations are set forth 
in United States Patent No. 5,049,867 ("the '867 patent") 
entitled "vehicle Security Apparatus", which issued on September 
17, 1991, which is assigned to Applicant's assignee, and which 
is fully incorporated herein by reference. While the vehicle 
security apparatus described and claimed within the '867 patent 
provides a very useful system, some improvements which are 
described and claimed within this application have been added to 
this system in order to allow the system to be more adaptable to 
various user requirements and to further address many of the 
aforedescribed prior system limitations. According to one aspect of the present invention a 
vehicle

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle security system comprising: 
   transmitter means for providing an activation signal 

for a certain duration of time; and 
   controller means for receiving said activation 

signal for storing a value, and for comparing said value to said 
duration of time and for providing an alarm signal only if said 

duration is greater than said value. 
The vehicle security system of claim 1, wherein said 
alarm signal comprises a light. 
The vehicle security system of claim 1, wherein said 
alarm signal is audible. 
The security system of claim 1, further comprising 
means for interfacing with a second security system. 
A vehicle security system including a sensor which 
is adapted to receive a motion input signal and to compare said

threshold value and less than said second threshold value and to 
provide a second alarm output when said received signal is 

greater than said second threshold value.
