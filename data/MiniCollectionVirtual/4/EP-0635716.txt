<ABSTRACT>
An X-ray analysis apparatus comprises a dispersive system of crystals for 
monochromatizing an incoming beam in a diffractometer or for analysing an X-ray 

beam in an X-ray spectrometer. The system of crystals comprises crystals whose crystal 
lattice planes do not extend parallel to effectively reflective crystal surfaces. As a result, 

a substantially higher effective radiation intensity can be obtained, for example notably 
for (220) crystal faces in germanium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a crystal monochromator for use in an X-ray analysis
apparatus, the monochromator consisting of a plurality of germanium monocrystals, the reflecting crystal
face each of which does not extend parallel to the diffractive crystal lattice planes in the crystal but
encloses a selected angle relative to the (220) lattice planes in the crystal.The invention also relates to an X-ray analysis apparatus provided with such
monochromator.A crystal monochromator of this kind is known from a publication in
NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS, Vol.152, 1978, Amsterdam NL, pages
161-166, entitled "DESIGN OF HIGH RESOLUTION X-RAY OPTICAL SYSTEM USING
DYNAMICAL DIFFRACTION FOR SYNCHROTRON RADIATION", by K.Kohra et.al.The phenomenon that the reflecting crystal faces used do not extend parallel to
the crystal lattice planes is referred to as asymmetry in the context of the relevant technical
field. The apparatus as described in said publication is provided with a channel-cut
monochromator for use in synchrotron X-radiation consisting of two germanium crystals in an
asymmetrical arrangement. In said article it is described that the angle between crystal faces
and crystal lattice planes (denoted as α in said publication) can have a value of 14 degrees,
which arrangement offers the advantage of providing a higher reflectivity than the
conventional monochromators. Because the reflecting crystal faces in the known
monochromator do not extend parallel to the crystal lattice planes in the crystals, a relatively
large acceptance angle is realised for an X-ray beam to be monochromatized. As a result, for
analysis in an X-ray diffractometer an effective X-ray beam with a substantially higher
radiation intensity can be generated and a higher detection efficiency can be realised in the X-ray
spectrometer.For some kinds of analysis techniques one wishes a relatively high resolution
which requires a relatively high monochromatisation of the X-rays. Such high resolution
cannot be obtained by using the known 2-crystal monochromator. It could be possible to use a
known 4-crystal monochromator for obtaining the required high resolution, but such known
monochromators have the drawback of providing a low radiation intensity. For specific
applications, for example examination of thin layers, be they imperfect or epitaxial layers 
and the like, the comparatively low radiation intensity of the known 4-crystal monochromators
may become objectionable. Using synchrotron X-radiation this loss of intensity often is not a
severe
