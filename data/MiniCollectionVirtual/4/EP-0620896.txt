<ABSTRACT>
A water turbine (1) comprises a turbine chamber (3), an inlet port (4) and an outlet port (6) opening into the chamber (3), and two or more rotors (11, 12) arranged within the chamber (3) with their axes of rotation parallel so as to be rotatable in the water flow passing between the inlet port (4) and the outlet port (6). Each of the rotors (11, 12) has two or more substantially equiangularly distributed lobes (17, 18), and the arrangement is such that the rotors (11, 12) rotate in opposite directions with their lobes in mesh with one another under the action of water impinging on the lobes of the rotors. Such a turbine can be constructed to operate efficiently with a low head of water, and is additionally of simple construction and therefore inexpensive to produce.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to water power engines and is more particularly, but not 
exclusively, concerned with water turbines which are capable of providing a reasonable 
power output under a low head of water. There are a number of applications in which it would be advantageous to be able 
to harness power, for hydroelectric power generation for example, from a flow of water 
having only a low head. A typical application is one in which power is to be generated 
by means ofthe water flow of a small river or stream where the head of water available 
is limited by the lie of the land and the necessity to limit civil engineering works on the 
basis of cost and/or environmental considerations. The use of conventional water 
turbines in such applications is for the most ruled out by the requirement for such 
turbines of high heads of water to obtain the necessary turbine speeds for economical 
generation of power. Other arrangements utilizing flapping gates, displaced floats and 
the like are ruled out because they are bulky and work with an intermittent action. 
Hydraulic rams are used extensively for raising water to provide a higher head, and a 
ram/turbine combination might be considered to provide a possible solution to this 
problem, although the size of ram required for the sort of flows envisaged in most 
applications would rule such an arrangement out in many circumstances. DE-A-470836 discloses a water turbine comprising a turbine chamber, and two 
grooved rotors arranged within the chamber with their axes of rotation parallel and 
geared together so as to be rotatable in synchronism by a common water jet impinging 
on the rotors at points on their peripheries which lie immediately adjacent to one  
 
another. However such an arrangement does not provide high efficiency energy 
conversion, and is not therefore suitable for economical generation of power utilizing 
only a low head of water. It is an object of the invention to provide a new form of water power engine which is 
particularly suitable for use with a low head of water. According to the present invention there is provided a water power engine comprising 
an engine chamber, inlet and outlet ports opening into the chamber for the passage of 
inlet and outlet water flows, and rotors arranged within the chamber with their axes of 
rotation parallel so as to be rotatable by the inlet water flow, each of the rotors having 
two or more substantially equiangularly distributed lobes and the arrangement being such 
that adjacent rotors rotate in

opening into the chamber (3) for the passage of inlet and outlet water flows, and rotors 

(11, 12) arranged within the chamber (3) with their axes of rotation (13, 14) parallel so 
as to be rotatable by the inlet water flow, each of the rotors (11, 12) having two or more 

substantially equiangularly distributed lobes (17, 18) and the arrangement being such that 
adjacent rotors rotate in opposite directions with their lobes in mesh with one another, 

the overall throughflow cross-section of the inlet port or ports (4) being less than the 
overall throughflow cross-section of the outlet port or ports (6) so as to ensure that the 

velocity of inlet water flow is high in relation to the velocity of outlet water flow.

12) define therebetween a space (47) for taking up water trapped between the meshing

rotors. 
An engine according to claim 3,

claim, characterised in that each rotor (11, 12) has a 

length appreciably greater than its diameter, and each of
