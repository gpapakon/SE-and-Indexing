<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTROCHEMICAL METHOD AND DEVICE FOR DRUG DELIVERYThe present invention relates to an iontophoretic method for drug 5 delivery and a device suitable for use in carrying out this method.In the present method, an electric current is generated by creating Galvani potential differences across at least two different ion selective membranes via a salt concentration difference over the membranes and bringing one anion selective membrane and one cation selective membrane o into contact with human or animal body either directly or indirectly. According to a feature of the invention at least one reservoir containing a salt solution is needed, the concentration of which differs from the salt concentration of the extracellular fluids in human or animal tissues. The method of the invention can be specially used with transdermal preparations but also with 5 mucoadhesive preparations and implants. For simplicity, the description which follows will refer to devices which are transdermal preparations, but it is to be understood that the method and device may be adapted to apply to mucoadhesive preparations and implants.Iontophoresis or iontophoretic therapy is the delivery into human or 0 animal tissue of a drug by the use of an electric fieic; or current. Reviews of methods, devices and drugs suitable for iontophoretic delivery are contained in e.g. Journal of Controlled Release Vol. 7, 1988, pp. 1-24, Drug Design and Delivery Vol. 4, 1989, pp. 1-12 and Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences Vol. 78, 1989, No. 5 , pp. 376-383. In addition to transdermal applications the 5 methods have also been used in ophthalmologic therapy (A.K. Banga & Y.W. Chien, J.Controlled Release Vol. 7, 1988, pp. 1-24).For the generation of electric current some kind of a battery is always needed, and current is introduced into the tissues of the body via wires and electrodes. The electric circuit is closed through the body of a patient after o attaching a device on the surface of the body or by the implantation of a device. The flux of a drug is enhanced mainly due to the migration of ionized drug molecules but also secondary effects e.g. electroosmotic convective flow and tissue alteration due to current can be responsible for the flux enhancement. Due to these secondary effects also the flux of neutral drug 

molecules is enhanced in the presence of electric field (L. Wearley & Y.W. Chien, Pharmaceutical Research Vol. 7, 1990, pp. 34-40).When current is passing in the circuit electrochemical reactions take place at the electrodes, and
