<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing a nuclear fuel pellet having 
little dispersion of density. Crystal cellulose is used as 

density lowering agent having a high melting point, so as not 
to be subject to the transformation due to the melt and 

thermal decomposition caused by heat generation and accumulation 
of plutonium in a mixture with plutonium powder. As a 

result, the dispersion of the pellet density can be significantly 
reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing 
a nuclear fuel pellet to be used in an atomic reactor. It is common practice to use a nuclear fuel pellet in 
nuclear power generation. The nuclear fuel pellet is several 
millimeters in diameter and has approximately the same height 
as the diameter. A number of such pellets constitute a fuel 
rod by being layered inside a covered tube made of stainless 
steel, for example. Fission of nuclear matter in nuclear fuel generally 
yields gaseous fission products (FP gas), which would become a 
factor in limitation the life of the fuel in the reactor 
because it swells the fuel pellet. For suppressing this 
undesirable effect of the FP gas, it is necessary to form a 
number of small hollows (hereinafter referred to as pores) for 
accumulating the gas therein in the pellet. Each pore has, 
for example, a dimension from several tens to several hundreds 
micrometers. Such pores formed in the pellets would act to 
obstruct the swelling of the fuel pellet caused by the FP gas. 
A pellet having the pores has low density, so as to be generally 
referred to as a low-density pellet. There have been proposed several methods for controlling 
the density during the manufacture of the nuclear fuel pellet.  
 
Among them the most normal and already practiced one comprises 
the steps of: adding spheroidized organic material to raw 
material powder; pressing this mixed powder to form green 
pellets; dewaxing these green pellets under reductive atmosphere 
approximately at 800°C to form pores in dewaxed green 
pellets; and sintering the dewaxed green pellets. To be 
suitable as a density lowering agent to be used for such a 
method, the following conditions must be satisfied : 1), to be 
a material not to react with a raw material powder; 2), to be 
easily removed during the dewaxing process; 3), to be adjustable 
into a predetermined shape and dimension; 4), not to 
easily adsorb moisture or gas; and 5), not to easily aggregate. For meeting the aforementioned five requirements, there 
are practically and experimentally used, for example, polyethylene, 
aromatic carboxylic acid, or higher fatty acid 
substances like glycerol-trihydroxy-stearate. In the aforementioned density lowering agent, however, 
the following problems would become unavoidable because of 
their low melting point of approximately 140°C. Namely, in 
using oxide fuel containing a large amount of plutonium or 
even when the plutonium content is small if the amount of the 
powder is large, a
