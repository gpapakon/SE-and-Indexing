<ABSTRACT>
The gaseous chemical compound, carbonyl sulphide, has hitherto been unknown as a fumigant for the control of insects and mites. Experiments have shown conclusively that carbonyl sulphide can be used as such a fumigant, with fumigation properties comparable to those of phosphine and methyl bromide. The effectiveness of carbonyl sulphide against insects (both adult and immature stages), mites, termites and moulds is demonstrated. In addition, its low absorption by grain, lower flammability than phosphine, lack of influence on seed germination, and apparent environmental safety make carbonyl sulphide particularly beneficial as a fumigant of stored grain. It may also be used to fumigate other stored produce (including perishable foodstuff), soil, timber and spaces (such as buildings) and any material likely to be infested by insects or mites, or act as a source of such infestation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns the use of 
the gas carbonyl sulphide (COS), 
which has also been termed carbon oxysulphide, as a 
fumigant. Fumigants are widely used for the disinfestation, and 
protection against infestation, that is usually required to 
protect particulate materials (such as grain) and other 
stored produce (including durable and perishable 
foodstuff), porous bulk materials (for example, soil or 
timber) and spaces (typically, empty buildings). An ideal 
fumigant should be toxic to insects, mites, nematodes, 
bacteria, fungi and moulds. It should be effective in low 
concentrations. It should have a low absorbtion by 
materials in the fumigated region. It should have a low 
mammalian toxicity and leave either no residue or an inert 
residue. In addition, the ideal fumigant should present no 
difficulties as far as safe handling is concerned, and it 
should not adversely affect the commodity or space that is 
being fumigated. No fumigant meets all of these "ideal" criteria. The two 
fumigants most commonly used in the fumigation of grain, 
other particulate materials, fruit and timber are phosphine 
and methyl bromide. Phosphine is the preferred fumigant for 
grain stores and the like because it is effective against  
 
grain pests and leaves little residue (which is essentially 
a harmless phosphate). However, phosphine is spontaneously 
combustible when its concentration exceeds a relatively low 
value. Methyl bromide is more toxic to grain pests than phosphine 
when used for short periods of fumigation, but phosphine is 
more toxic to grain pests when long term fumigation is 
effected. Methyl bromide has a lower flammability than 
phosphine, but recent work has shown that methyl bromide 
depletes the ozone layer. Thus approval of methyl bromide 
as a fumigant is currently under review, following the 
Montreal protocol. Other fumigants that have been used against grain pests 
include acrylonitrile, carbon disulphide, carbon 
tetrachloride, chloropicrin, ethylene dibromide, ethylene 
dichloride, ethylene oxide, hydrogen cyanide and sulphuryl 
fluoride. It will be noted that a halogen is present in 
the majority of these "conventional" fumigants, none of 
which has the "ideal" fumigant properties. For many years, there has been a constant seeking of new 
fumigants and there is no doubt that the quest for improved 
fumigants will continue. Environ. Exp. Bot. (1986), 26(4), pages 355 to 364, 
discloses the fumigation of ryegrass and radish in the 
light with 9.9 µg/m3 of [35S]-carbonyl
