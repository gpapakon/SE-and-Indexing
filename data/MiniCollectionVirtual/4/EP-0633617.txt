<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a rechargeable electrochemical generator comprising an anode chosen from the materials in which lithium is capable of being inserted, a cathode, and an electrolyte consisting of a solution of a lithium salt in a non-aqueous solvent. The material of the said cathode comprises at least one compound which is a monophase oxide of manganese and lithium, having a yellow-green colour, having an orthorhombic crystal structure whose lattice parameters are as follows: a = 0.459 +/- 0.004 nm b = 0.577 +/- 0.004 nm and c = 0.281 +/- 0.003 nm, and containing lithium ions in an Li/Mn molar ratio such that 0.85 
<
/= Li/Mn 
<
/= 1.10. After initial charging, the said compound discharges over two levels, the higher of which has a mean voltage greater than 3.5 volts with respect to lithium.
