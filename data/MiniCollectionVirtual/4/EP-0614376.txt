<DESCRIPTION>
A METHOD AND FORMULATIONS USEFUL TO IMPROVE THE STUDY OF HUMAN BODY CAVITIESThis invention relates to a method and formula¬ tions useful for obtaining the in-vivo visualization of body cavities using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) . In particular, it relates to the use of solutions of positive paramagnetic contrast agents for NMR examina¬ tions of said cavities via proton-density and T_- weighted sequences, with the proviso that said parama¬ gnetic agents are kept in a well-defined concentration range. In this way it is possible to obtain clear images of organic alterations (whether neoplastic and not) of the GI (gastro-intestinal) tract, the bladder, and/or the cavities of the female reproductive apparatus in patients suffering from these pathologies. It is well known that NMR allows the imaging of internal organs of living .organisms. Often it can support or substitute the diagnostic techniques based on the use of ionizing radiations, for its positive impact on patients1 and operators' health. Unfortuna¬ tely, the diagnostic advantages of this technique, when used for examinations involving the Gi tract, the bladder and/or the cavities of the female reproductive apparatus, are very limited due to a series of problems basically related to signal iεointensity of adjacent tissues which, when images are taken, usually occurs among the intestinal or the bladder wall, the lumen content, the contiguous organs, and neoplastic intra- and/or extra lumen lesions. Moreover, the interpreta¬ tion of GI images is complicated by the winding confi- 

 guration and the unhomogenized filling of ' the intestine. And it is well known in the present radiolo¬ gical practice that clear images for diagnostic use, are obtained only if the cavity walls under examination are properly relaxed.Researchers have tried to overcome these problems, although in a partial way, by administering adequate contrast media. Up to now they have mainly proposed the so-called negative contrast media, which basically rely on the use of particles of ferromagnetic or superpara- magnetic material. These substances bring about a decrease of signal intensity of the lumen content when T_-weighted sequences are used [WO 8504330 (Nyegaard) , EP 186616 (Schering), WO 8800060 (Advanced Magnetics), EP 414287 (Nycomed)]. However, the use of said contrast media is limited by the presence in the images of so- called metal artefacts (distortions) , reducing their diagnostic value.Other negative contrast media irely on a dispersion of diamagnetic substances
