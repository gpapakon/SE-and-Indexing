<ABSTRACT>
A stack of folded and glued corrugated paperboard boxes is slit in unison with a thin cutting blade having a linear cutting edge disposed parallel to the plane of the boxes and moved through the stack in an angular direction to slit essentially one box at a time. The stack is squared before slitting to align the box edges, however, the force of the blade on the stack as it moves therethrough holds the receding stack together such that the cut halves of each box may part laterally as the blade passes therethrough to avoid any crushing of the corrugated paperboard media.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to slitting 
boxes made of corrugated paperboard and, more 
particularly, to an apparatus and method for slitting 
knocked down boxes in a stack formed in a stacking device 
as the boxes exit from a folding and gluing apparatus. Corrugated paperboard box blanks are 
conventionally printed, folded and glued to form what are 
referred to as "knocked down boxes" in a flexo-folder-gluer 
apparatus. This apparatus includes a flexographic 
printer, a folding mechanism which folds opposite sides 
of the blank along pre-scored lines, and a gluing device 
which applies an adhesive along the overlapping edges of 
the laterally folded sides. The flattened container or 
knocked down box is thus completely formed and, after the 
glue dries, the boxes can be stacked and banded for 
shipment and subsequent assembly. It is known in the art 
to stack the knocked down boxes exiting the flexo-folder-gluer 
(hereinafter sometimes referred to as a "flexo") 
to utilize the stack weight to hold the glued edges 
together until the glue sets. It is also known in the 
art to form a shingle of knocked down boxes as they exit 
from the flexo, also utilizing the weight of the 
overlapping boxes in the shingle to hold the box position 
until the adhesive dries. The knocked down boxes typically assembled in 
a flexo are of a conventional construction, including 
four sides, the overlapping edges of two sides of which 
are glued together on a glue tab, and four slotted end 
flaps extending integrally from opposite ends of the 
sides to eventually form the top and bottom closure flaps 
when the box is subsequently assembled. As indicated, 
these knocked down boxes are ordinarily finished 
containers and require no further processing, apart from 
stacking and banding for shipment. However, it is also  
 
known in the art to assemble certain special 
constructions of knocked down boxes in a flexo, which 
boxes are subsequently slit into two or more parts to 
form smaller containers of either a conventional or 
modified type. For example, it is known to assemble a 
large regular slotted container (RSC) and subsequently 
slit the same along a median line to form two half 
slotted containers, each of which comprises a knocked 
down container with side walls and bottom flaps or top 
flaps, but not both. Similarly, a large special regular 
slotted container can be formed in a flexo-folder-gluer 
in the form of two integrally attached half size regular 
slotted containers by forming the blank with special 
double

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for slitting a stack (15) of folded corrugated 
paperboard boxes (16) each having a pair of opposite folded edges (17) 

and a pair of opposite cut edges (18) extending normal to the folded 
edges, said apparatus comprising: 


means (22) for supporting the stack in engagement with the face 
of a box on one end of the stack; 
means (23, 24) for squaring the cut edges of the boxes; 
a cutting blade (21, 37, 44) positioned adjacent the other end of 
the stack and having a cutting edge (32, 40, 46) disposed parallel to the 

cut edges of the boxes, and characterised in that the cutting blade (21, 
37, 44) is of length greater than the distance between the opposite folded 

edges (17) of the boxes (16), the slitting depth of the cutting blade (21, 
37, 44) measured from and perpendicular to the cutting edge (32, 40, 

46) being at least as great as the thickness of a folded box (16); the 
apparatus including means (34, 48) for moving the cutting blade through 

the stack on a line in the cutting plane, said line being disposed at an 
acute angle with respect to the plane of the box supporting means (22) 

toward said one end of the stack and across the folded edges of the 
boxes to slit essentially one box at a time, the acute angle being less than 

about 10°. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the stack 
supporting means (22) comprises conveying means for supporting the 

stack from below and for moving the stack into a slitting position 
adjacent the cutting blade (21, 37, 44).  

 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said squaring 
means (23, 24) comprises: 


a first squaring pan (23) positionable above the conveying 
means and engageable by the cut edges (18) of the boxes (16) on one 

side of the stack in response to movement of the stack into the slitting 
position; and 
a second squaring pan (24) positionable above the conveying 
means and moveable into engagement with the cut edges (18) on the 

opposite side of the stack. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 3, including means for 
moving one of said squaring pans (23, 24) out of engagement with the 

stack in response to movement of the cutting blade (21, 37, 44) into
