<DESCRIPTION>
 SNOW SKI WITH INTEGRAL BINDING ISOLATION MOUNTING PLATETechnical FieldThe present invention relates to snow skis or snow boards that are adapted to be ridden and which have bindings mounted thereon. In particular, the present invention relates to fiber reinforced skis such as those formed by the wet wrap or torsion box process wherein a wooden or foam plastic core is wrapped with a fiber-reinforced sheet impregnated with resin, and then cured under pressure in a mold with a base assembly. The term "fiber reinforced" is meant to include any high modulus fibrous materials such as glass, aramid fibers such as Kevlarâ„¢, graphite, metal wire, polyester, etc.Background of the InventionHigh performance skis are carefully designed in order to give the user maximum control during skiing. This includes designing the skis to cleanly "carve" turns; that is, during the carving of a turn, every point on the edge of the ski is designed to pass over a single point on the snow. In order to accomplish this, skis are shaped with curved edges such that the waist portion of the ski is narrower than the shovel or tail portions of the ski. In addition to the exterior shape of the ski, the structural core of the ski is carefully tailored such that the ski has the ability to smoothly flex over its length during the carving of a turn.During skiing, a snow ski flexes continuously both in response to irregularities in the snow and in response to the user's movements, such as during turning. Flexing of a fiber-reinforced ski causes the various layers of fiberglass and other materials that make up the body of the ski to shear with respect to each other. Elements of the ski which effect the interlaminar shear of 

the materials that make up the ski affect the resulting flex of the ski. As discussed above, skis are designed to flex freely over their length and in accordance with certain desired flex patterns. Elements of the ski that interfere with such flex patterns undesirably affect the performance of the ski. Mounting ski bindings on the upper* surface of skis and positioning relatively rigid boots within the bindings are known to interfere with the desired flex patterns of the ski. Ski bindings are typically mounted on the top surface of the narrowed waist portion of the ski through the use of screw-type fasteners that extend through the top surface of the ski downward into the core of the ski. A number of fasteners are typically used to hold both the toe piece and heel piece of the binding to the ski. Each of these fasteners

<CLAIMS>
The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows:
1. A board, such as a snow ski or snowboard for use on snow or ice, the board comprising:
(a) a longitudinally extending structural but flexing body having a core and an outer layer enclosing said core, said structural body having a top surface formed by said outer layer with an upwardly opening recess therein;
(b) plate means for mounting a boot binding thereon, said plate means being positioned in said recess;
(c) a viscoelastic layer positioned between said body and said plate means such that said plate means is isolated from direct contact with said body; and
(d) means for attaching said body, said plate means and said viscoelastic layer together to permit flexing of said body relative to said plate means by viscoelastic deformation of said viscoelastic layer.
2. The board of Claim 1, wherein said binding is mounted to said plate means with screw-type fasteners, and wherein said plate means has a thickness sufficient to receive said fasteners such that said fasteners do not extend into said body.
3. The board of Claim 2, wherein said plate means has a thickness to receive said fasteners totally within said plate means such that said fasteners do not extend into said viscoelastic layer.
4. The board of Claim 1, wherein said body includes a laterally narrowed waist portion and said recess is positioned at said waist portion.
5. The board of Claim 4, wherein said body further includes means for reinforcing the waist portion.
6. The board of Claim 1, wherein said plate means is complementarity shaped to fill said recess such that the top surface of said plate means forms a smooth continuation of the top surface of the body at opposite ends of said recess. 


 7. The board of Claim 1, wherein said plate means is sized to receive a ski binding mounted thereon.
8. The board of Claim 1, wherein said viscoelastic layer is a sheet of urethane.
9. The board of Claim 1, wherein said means for attaching said body, said plate means and said viscoelastic layer together is a thermosetting resin.
10. A snow ski comprising: a) a longitudinally extending structural but flexing body having a shovel portion, a waist portion and a tail portion, the body including a core and reinforcing material wrapped around and bonded to said core, said body having a top surface including a recess opening upward in said waist portion; b) a mounting plate adapted to fill said recess and to receive and hold a ski binding by means of at least one fastener; c) a viscoelastic layer positioned in said recess between said mounting plate and said body such that the viscoelastic layer isolates said mounting plate from direct contact with said body; and, d) means for bonding said viscoelastic layer to said mounting plate and said body to permit flexing of said body relative to said mounting plate by viscoelastic deformation of said viscoelastic layer.
11. The snow ski of Claim 10, wherein said mounting plate is adapted to receive and hold said fastener mounting said ski binding to said mounting plate such that said fastener does not extend into said body.
12. The snow ski of Claim 11, wherein said mounting plate is adapted to receive and hold said fastener mounting said ski binding to said mounting plate such that said fastener does not extend into said viscoelastic layer.
13. The snow ski of Claim 10, wherein said mounting plate further comprises a core wrapped with a fiberglass material, said fiberglass material being bonded to said core by resin. 


 14. The snow ski of Claim 10, wherein said mounting plate further includes reinforcing material for assisting in retaining said fastener therein.
15. The snow ski of Claim 10, wherein said body further includes means for reinforcing said waist portion.
16. A snow ski comprising: a) a longitudinally extending structural but flexing body having a central portion including a top surface; b) plate means adapted for mounting a ski binding through the use of at least one fastener, the plate means being positioned on said top surface of said central portion; c) a viscoelastic layer positioned between said plate means and said body such that said plate means is not in rigid contact with said body, said plate means and said fastener being constructed and arranged relatively such that said fastener does not contact said viscoelastic layer; and d) means for attaching said plate means, said viscoelastic layer and said body together to permit flexing of said body relative to said plate means by viscoelastic deformation of said viscoelastic layer.
17. A snow ski including an integral plate means for mounting a snow ski binding of the type which is held to the snow ski with screw-type fasteners, the ski comprising: a) a longitudinally extending structural but flexing body having a core, a plurality of strands of fiberglass reinforcement overlying said core and bonded thereto; b) a mounting plate adapted to be positioned longitudinally intermediate on the top surface of said body, said mounting plate having a thickness sufficient to receive said screw-type fasteners such that said fasteners do not extend through said mounting plate; c) viscoelastic material positioned between said body and said mounting plate and bonded thereto to permit flexing of said body relative to said plate by viscoelastic deformation of said viscoelastic material.
18. A board, such as a snow ski or snowboard for use on snow or ice, the board comprising: 


 a) a longitudinally extending body having a recess formed on a top surface; b) plate means for mounting a boot binding thereon, said plate means being adapted to be positioned in said recess; c) a viscoelastic layer positioned between said body and said plate means such that said plate means is isolated from direct contact with said body, said viscoelastic layer being a sheet of urethane; and, d) means for attaching said body, said plate means and said viscoelastic material together.
