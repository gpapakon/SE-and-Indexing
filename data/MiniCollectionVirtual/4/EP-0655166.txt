<ABSTRACT>
The protective device described has at least one sensor (sensor H, temperature sensor R1) which delivers an electrical signal to a control circuit. The sensor is of particular use in determining the operational status of an electrical consumer, in particular a rotary-pump motor, a slotted-tube pump motor or a fan motor (pump motor M). In addition, the protective device has a mains-operated supply (N), a cut-out switch (1) operated by a bimetallic strip (18) and designed to interrupt the consumer circuit, and a temperature-dependent resistor (19) designed to activate the bimetallic strip (18). The bimetallic strip (18) is biased by a spring, in the direction in which it bends, to keep it in mechanical and electrical contact with the resistor (19), and is thus connected electrically in series with the resistor (19) in the control circuit.
