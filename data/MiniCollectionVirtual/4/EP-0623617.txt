<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nitromethylene compounds, to processes for their 
preparation and to the use of such compounds as pesticides. U.S. Patent No. 3993648 (Shell Oil Company) discloses nitromethylene compounds 
of general formula 
together with resonance hybrids, geometric isomers, and tautomers, as well as mixtures 
thereof, and salts, wherein R represents hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyalkyl, cycloalkyl, 
cyanoalkyl, haloalkenyl, aralkyl or alkoxycarbonylvinyl and R¹ represents hydrogen or 
alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, haloalkyl, haloalkenyl, halo(hydroxy)alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, cyanoalkyl, 
hydroxyalkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl, alkylcarbonylalkyl, alkylthioalkyl, alkylsulfinylalkyl, 
aryl, aralkyl or arylthio optionally substituted on the ring by one or more of halogen, nitro, 
cyano, alkyl, aryl, alkoxy or aryloxy; halogen; aminomethyl, -CH₂-NR²R³, where R² is 
alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, haloaryl or aralkyl, and R³ is 
hydrogen or one of the moieties represented by R²;

-(CH₂)n-R⁴


 
wherein n is zero, one or two, and R⁴ is a heteromonocyclic moiety of from five to six 
carbon atoms in the ring, containing in the ring carbon atoms and one to two of oxygen  
 
(-O-) sulphur (-S-) and nitrogen (=N-, or -NH-) bonded to carbon in the ring, or is drawn, 
in the specification of US 3993648, as 
   The compounds of US Patent No. 3993648 are said to exhibit useful insecticidal 
activity, being of particular interest for control of larval forms of insects, for example corn 
earworm. Some activity of certain compounds against whiteflies and houseflies is also 
mentioned. It is believed that the most active compound of those disclosed in US Patent No. 
3993648 is tetrahydro-2-(nitromethylene)-2H-1,3 thiazine (R=R¹=H). However, no 
compounds of US Patent No. 3993648 advanced to commercialisation. This invention is based on the discovery of novel nitromethylene thiazine compounds 
which exhibit pesticidal activity. Certain compounds of the present invention have been 
found to exhibit insecticidal activity which compares well with that of the compound of US 
Patent No. 3993648, mentioned above, which is believed to be the most active compound 
thereof. According to the present invention, there is provided nitromethylene thiazine 
compounds of general formula  wherein R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, R¹ represents a hydrogen atom 
or an alkyl group, n is 0 or 1, and Het represents a optionally substituted 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl 
or 5-isoxazolyl group. Unless otherwise
