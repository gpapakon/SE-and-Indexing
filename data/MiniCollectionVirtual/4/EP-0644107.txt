<ABSTRACT>
[PURPOSE] To raise the external air admission 

efficiency of a wind inlet opening. 
[CONSTITUTION] A pair of wind inlet openings 10 and a 

pair of wind introduction paths 11 are formed in a 
leftwardly and rightwardly symmetrical relationship on 

left and right side portions 13 of a fairing 1. The 
wind introduction paths 11 are each formed as a smooth 

continuous curved face in a transverse direction, and a 
more central side curved face 18 of it is formed narrower 

than an outer side curved face 19. When 
surface air flows W, along the surface of the front face 12, 

flow on the wind introduction paths 11, since the more 
central side curved faces 18 are narrower detachment of the surface 

air is less likely to occur, and the external air admission 
efficiency of the wind inlet openings 10 is raised.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a windshield apparatus
for a motorcycle wherein a pair of wind inlet openings
opened forwardly are provided at left and right
symmetrical positions of a windshield such that external
air is introduced into an intake apparatus for an engine
by way of a pair of external air admission pipes from
the wind inlet openings.Such a windshield apparatus as described above
is already known, and a surface of the windshield
forwardly of wind inlet openings is formed into recessed
grooves to form wind introduction paths to the wind
inlet openings (refer to, as an example, Japanese Patent
Laid-Open Application No. Heisei 2-128977).By the way, since the transverse section of the
wind introduction paths is approximate to a
substantially channel-shaped section as indicated by an
imaginary line in FIG. 3 and a wall face a on the body
center side varies substantially perpendicularly, a
surface flow W of running wind passing on the wind 
introduction path in the transverse direction is
sometimes exfoliated, at the portion of the wall face a,
from the surface of the windshield. Such a phenomenon
likely occurs when cross wind is strong such as upon
cornering, and as a result, the external air admission
efficiency is deteriorated. Thus, it is an object of
the present invention to eliminate such a problem as
described above and enhance the external air admission
efficiency of wind inlet openings.The above mentioned problems are solved by the features
stated in claim 1. When running wind flows outwardly from the
center side of the body in directions transverse to the
wind introduction paths, since the curved faces in the
transverse direction of the wind introduction paths are
formed as smooth continuous curved faces and besides the
portion of each of the continuous curved faces on the
center side of the body is made more moderate than the
portion on the outer side of the body, the running wind
flows in the wind introduction paths in a condition
wherein it is not exfoliated readily and enters the wind
inlet openings, and accordingly, the external air
admission efficiency is enhanced.An embodiment will be described with reference
to FIGS. 1 to 7. FIG. 1 is a front elevational view of 
a windshield 1 which is a windshield apparatus for a
motorcycle of the embodiment, FIG. 2 is a plan view of
the windshield 1, FIG. 3 is an enlarged sectional view
taken along line A-A in FIG. 2, and FIG. 4 is a side
elevational view of a motorcycle to which the present
embodiment is applied.Referring first to FIG. 4, the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A windshield apparatus for a motorcycle which includes a
windshield (1) which covers over a front portion of a body

of the motorcycle, wherein external air is introduced into
an intake apparatus (6) of an engine (3) by way of a pair

of intake conduits (9) from a pair of air inlet openings
(10) provided at left and right symmetrical positions of

said windshield (1) and opened forwardly,

characterized in that

one recessed groove is formed in a surface of said
windshield (1) forwardly of each air inlet opening (10) and

provides an air introduction path (11) to said air inlet
opening (10), and
each recessed groove has a surface formed as smooth
continuous curved surface (18, 19) in a transverse

direction of said air introduction path (11) and having a
first portion (18) adjacent to a center side of the body

and a second portion (19) on an outer side of the body, 
said first portion (18) being curved more moderately than

said second portion (19).
A windshield apparatus for a motorcycle according to claim
1, wherein an air cleaner (17) is located rearwardly of

said windshield (1).
