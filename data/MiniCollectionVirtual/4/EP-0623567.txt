<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for preparing a microporous body having thermal insulating properties, by     a) mixing   I) 0.5-60% by weight of one or more compound(s) selected from the group consisting of the oxides, hydroxides and carbonates of the metals of the 2nd main group; II) 5-95% by weight of pyrogenic SiO2 containing 0-20% by weight of Al2O3 (based on the SiO2 used); III) 0-60% by weight of an opacifier having at least one absorption maximum in the wavelength range of 1.5-10  mu m;   IV) 0.1-10% by weight of an organic fibre;     b) Pressing the mixture prepared to form a shaped body; c) Heating the shaped body produced to a temperature above 700@C.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of a microporous 
body having heat insulation properties which is based on 

highly disperse oxides of the elements silicon and/or 
aluminum, which comprises 


a) mixing of 

I) 0.5 - 60% by weight of one or more compound(s) 
from the group comprising oxides, hydroxides and 

carbonates of metals of main group 2; 
II) 5 - 95% by weight of pyrogenically prepared SiO₂ 
with a content of 0 - 20% by weight of Al₂O₃ (based 

on the SiO₂ employed); 
III) 0 - 60% by weight of an opacifying agent having 
at least one absorption maximum in the wavelength 

range of 1.5 - 10 µm; 
IV) 0.1 - 10% by weight of an organic fiber; 
b) pressing the mixture prepared to form a shaped 
article 
c) heating of the shaped article produced at a 
temperature above 700°C. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
heating of the shaped article in step c) of the process 

is carried out under oxidizing conditions. 
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the shaped article is heated to a temperature of 750 - 

950°C, preferably to 800 - 950°C, in step c) of the 
process. 
The process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein, after heating, the shaped article is worked 

mechanically, rendered hydrophobic, covered with inorganic 
layers, such as gypsum or fireproof compositions, 

laminated with plastic film or metal foil, paper or glass 
fabric, or sealed in a gastight, evacuated casing. 
The use of the microporous body produced as 
claimed in one of claims 1 to 4 as a heat insulating 

material in the temperature range from -273°C to 950°C.
