<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to methods for the pretreatment of a lignocellulose-containing biomass. Pretreatment comprises the addition of calcium hydroxide and water to the biomass to form a mixture, and subjecting the mixture to relatively high temperatures for a period of time sufficient to render the biomass amenable to digestion. The pretreated biomass is digested to produce useful products such as feedstocks, fuels, and compounds including fatty acids, sugars, ketones and alcohols. Alternatively, the pretreatment process includes the addition of an oxidizing agent, selected from the group consisting of oxygen and oxygen-containing gasses, to the mixture under pressure. The invention is also directed to a method for the recovery of calcium from the pretreated biomass.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods for the pretreatment of a lignin
containing biomass to render the biomass amenable to digestion. Pretreatment
comprises the addition of calcium hydroxide and water to the biomass to form
a mixture, and maintaining the mixture at a relatively high temperature.
Alternatively, an oxidizing agent, selected from the group consisting of oxygen
and oxygen-containing gasses, may be added under pressure to the mixture.
The invention also relates to the digested products of the pretreated biomass
which includes useful feedstocks, fuels, and chemicals such as sugars, ketones,
fatty acids and alcohols, and to a method for the recovery of calcium from the
pretreated biomass.Biomass can be classified in three main categories: sugar-, starch-
and cellulose-containing plants. Sugar-containing plants (e.g. sweet sorghum,
sugarcane) and starch-containing plants (e.g. corn, rice, wheat, sweet potatoes)
are primarily used as food sources. Cellulose-containing plants and waste
products (e.g. grasses, wood, bagasse, straws) are the most abundant forms of
biomass. Although they are not easily converted to useful products, a well
engineered process to convert them to feedstock may potentially be economical
since the costs of feedstock are much less than those of sugar- and starch-containing
biomass.Cellulose-containing materials are generally referred to as
lignocellulosics because they contain cellulose (40% - 60%), hemicellulose
(20% - 40%) and lignin (10% -25%). Non-woody biomass generally contains
less than about 15-20% lignin. Cellulose, a glucose polymer, can be hydrolyzed 
to glucose using acid, enzymes or microbes. Glucose can serve as a feedstock
for fuel alcohol and single-cell protein production. Microbial hydrolysis
produces cellular biomass (single-cell protein) and metabolic waste products
such as organic acids. Acid hydrolysis, although simple, produces many
undesirable degradation products. Enzymatic hydrolysis is the cleanest and
most preferred approach. However, production of enzymes, mainly cellulase
and cellobiase, can be an expensive step. Apart from alcohol production,
lignocellulose can be used as inexpensive cattle feed. Since raw lignocellulose
cannot be easily digested by cattle, it must be processed to improve its
digestibility before it can be fed to ruminants. Also, anaerobic fermentation
using rumen microorganisms can produce low molecular weight volatile fatty
acids.Cellulose is the world's most abundant biological material.
