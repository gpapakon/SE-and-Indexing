<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides isolated DNA compounds and 
recombinant DNA vectors that encode mammalian influx peptide 

transporter activity. The invention also provides host cells 
transformed with these vectors and a method for production of 

mammalian influx peptide transporter activity by recombinant DNA 
techniques. The invention also provides a method for 

identifying compounds that are transported into the cell by the 
influx peptide transporter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of recombinant 
deoxyribonucleic acid (hereinafter "DNA") technology. The 
invention provides isolated DNA compounds that comprise DNA 
encoding a proton-dependent influx peptide transport carrier 
(hereinafter "influx peptide transporter") activity. 
Recombinant DNA vectors and host cells are also provided. In mammalian cells, peptides are transported in and out of 
cells by several different transport carriers. Functionally, 
there are transporters responsible for the influx of peptides 
into the cell and transporters responsible for the efflux of 
peptides out of the cells. Influx transporters transport small 
peptides and related compounds into the cytoplasm, and are 
indirectly linked to an energy source through ion gradients. 
Efflux transporters consist of several different transporters 
that function to remove peptides from the cytoplasm. These 
include the P-glycoprotein that removes a number of oncolytics 
as well as hydrophobic peptides (Endicott and Ling, 1989, 
Annu. Rev. Biochem. 
58:137-171; Sharma et al. 1992, J. Biol. Chem. 
267:5731-5734). The present invention relates to peptide transporters 
responsible for influx of peptides into cells or organelles. 
This class of peptide transporters is located in the 
gastrointestinal tract, kidney, placenta, and liver lysosomes 
(Ganapathy et al., 1991, Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 28:317-323; 
Skopicki et al., 1991, Am. J. Physiol. 261:F670-F678; Ganapathy 
et al., 1981, J. Biol. Chem. 256:118-124; Bird and Lloyd, 1990, 
Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1024:267-270). Generally, the influx peptide transporter is located in the 
brush border of the epithelial cells of the mucosa. Properties 
of the transporter have been studied in situ in intestinal 
mucosa preparations and in vitro with brush border membrane 
vesicles, isolated enterocytes, and cell culture. Studies have 
been conducted with preparations from the rat, hamster, rabbit,  
 
chicken, Japanese newt, and humans (Ganapathy and Leibach, 1991, 
Curr. Biol. 3:695-701; Said at al., 1988, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 
941: 232-240; Kramer et al., 1988, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 939: 
167-172; Colonge et al., 1990, Am. J. Physiol. 259:G775-G780; 
Shimada and Hoshi, 1986, Jpn. J. Physiol. 36: 451-465; Matthews 
and Burston, 1984, Clinical Sci., 67:541-549). Many different 
solutes including small peptides (di- and tripeptides), 
antibiotics (including several oral Î²-lactams), oral angiotensin 
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and oral renin inhibitors 
are transported
