<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing a ply of composite material by 
applying an adhesive to a textile material comprising 

greige cords, so as to achieve an acceptable bond between 
the cords an elastomeric matrix, while not significantly 

altering the physical properties of the cords, is provided. 
The textile material comprises warp cords and weft cords; 

the weft cords are used to convey the warp cords through a 
heat setting oven without applying substantial tension to 

the warp cords, so as to not change their stress-strain 
properties. In the illustrated embodiment, the warp cords 

comprise aramid having a linear density of 500 to 3600 
Denier and a twist multiplier of 5 to 8. The cords can be 

used in a crown reinforcing spirally wound overlay 
structure of a tire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
dipping a ply of greige cords, used for reinforcing
pneumatic tires, and pneumatic tires comprising radial
carcass plies including such cords.Radial carcass tires, having a reinforcing member
disposed radially outwardly of the belt assembly and
comprising textile cords oriented at small angles with
respect to the mid-circumferential plane of the tire, have
been found to be particularly durable when subjected to
high revolution speeds.Such a reinforcing member, referred to as an overlay
ply, may comprise a spirally wound strip, made from cord
reinforced elastomeric material, located radially outward
of the belt plies. Generally, the material of the
reinforcing cords have a low modulus, for instance nylon,
in order to accommodate the expansion of the belt during
the shaping and vulcanizing steps in the manufacture of a
tire. The modulus of a cord is, inter alia, a function of
the twist of the different yarns used in the cord, the cord
twist, and the tension/stress to which the cord is
subjected during the dipping operation.High modulus materials, e.g. aramid, have potential
advantages in high speed tires in view of their dimensional
stability, but because of their dimensional stability, such
cords must be twisted, so that the finished cord has the
expansion potential required to match the expansion that a
tire goes through during shaping and vulcanizing.EP-A- 412 928 discloses a textile overlay structure
which is reinforced with cords made of aramid; the cords
have a twist multiplier (as defined herebelow) between 8
and 12 and at least one of the yarns included in the cords
has a twist of at least 14 turns per inch (TPI) (540 turns
per meter (TPM)). Tires comprising such an overlay
structure, however, could have an increased noise emission.It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
process for coating a ply of greige cords, used for
reinforcing pneumatic tires, with an adhesive, without
substantially changing the physical properties of the
cords.It is a further object of the present invention to
provide a pneumatic tire with an overlay structure
reinforced with aramid cords, which has a low gauge, low
noise emission, and maintains good high speed properties.Other objects of the invention will be apparent from
the following description and claims.A method of preparing a composite ply by applying an
adhesive to a textile material comprising greige cords, in
which the textile comprises warp cords and weft cords, is
provided. The adhesive is adapted
