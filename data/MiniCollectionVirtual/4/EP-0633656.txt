<ABSTRACT>
A MOS differential voltage-to-current 
converter circuit has first and second MOS transistors 

forming a differential pair and a resistor connected 
between the sources of the first and second MOS 

transistors. These first and second MOS transistors 
are connected to the sources of third and fourth MOS 

transistors, at respective sources. By biasing the 
third and fourth MOS transistors, with a constant 

current, differential input voltage is supplied to the 
gates of the third and fourth MOS transistors. The 

drain outputs of the third and fourth MOS transistors 
are respectively connected to first and second signal 

transmission circuits for transmitting the drain 
outputs to the gates of the first and second MOS 

transistors through the first and second signal 
transmission circuits. With taking the current flowing 

through the first and second MOS transistors as a 
differential output, a voltage-to-current conversion 

characteristics not depending upon variable property of 
the MOS transistors can be obtained.

MOS differential voltage-to-current converter circuit
will be discussed with reference to the drawings.
Throughout the disclosure, a field-effect MOS transistor
will be simply referred to as "MOSFET", N-channel field -
effect MOS transistor will be referred to as "NMOSFET",

conventional differential voltage-to-current converter
circuit (hereinafter referred to as "first prior art") is

differential voltage-current converter circuit,
respectively.Here, it is assumed that currents I01 and I02 of
the first and second constant current sources are equal
to each other. Double of the current I01 or I02 is
defined as a constant current I00 which is expressed by
the following equation (1). A differential output
current ΔI and a differential input voltage ΔV are
respectively expressed by the following equation (2).Discussion is now given for an input/output
