<DESCRIPTION>
 EXPRESSION OF POLYPEPTIDES IN E. COLI UNDER CONTROL OF THE E. COLI MDH-GENE PROMOTERThis invention relates to methods for expressing polypeptides in E. coli , and to expression vectors and recombinant DNA molecules useful in such methods. The invention further provides a process for producing polypeptides derived from genes native to the genus Thermus.Bacteria such as E. coli are widely used as host organisms in processes for the production of foreign polypeptides by recombinant DNA technology. Such processes are particularly useful where desired polypeptides are not easily obtained from their natural source organisms.In the past, techniques for the cloning and expression of foreign genes in micro organisms have involved construction of recombinant expression vectors comprising the coding sequence of the desired foreign gene under the control of the specific expression mechanisms of the organism into which the vector is to be introduced.An important element of these expression mechanisms is the promoter. This is a region of DNA located in relatively close proximity to the coding sequence of a structural gene. The promoter is involved in the binding of DNA polymerase to initiate transcription. Selection of a suitable promoter is important in order to obtain efficient expression. In processes where a high level of expression of product 

 polypeptide is required, it is usual to select a strong promoter, i.e. one which can sustain a high rate of transcription.In the context of expression systems based on E. colt known strong promoters include the naturally occurring lac and trp promoters and the synthetic hybrid tac promoter. In general, these promoters have consensus sequences showing only slight variation from the followin :-TTGACA 17bp TATAAT(-35) (-10)It has been an aim of many researchers to provide additional strong promoters particularly in order to allow expression at high levels in circumstances where use of available promoters is problematical. To this end, promoters such as the tac promoter (a hybrid between the trp and lac promoters) have been constructed.It is an object of the present invention, according to one aspect thereof to provide a novel expression system for expressing genes (especially, but not exclusively foreign genes) in E. coli.It has now surprisingly been found that an 27. coli gene control sequence which includes a promoter which does not have the consensus sequence shown above can sustain a high rate of transcription. 

 Thus according to one aspect of the present invention
