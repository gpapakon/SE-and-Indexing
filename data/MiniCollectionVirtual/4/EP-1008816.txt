<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the diagnosis of an air conditioning
system having a condenser, an evaporator, an expansion device and a

compressor, the stroke of which can be set via a valve, a maximum
compressor stroke is set abruptly when the air conditioning system is

running and a pressure impulse arising in the high pressure side of
the refrigerant circuit is measured in order to determine the degree

of filling of the refrigerant circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for determining the degree of filling of the refrigerant circuit
of an air conditioning system, in particular a vehicle air
conditioning system, having a condenser, an evaporator, an expansion
device and a compressor, the stroke of which can be set via a valve.The above named air conditioning systems are known in
principle and are used in particular in vehicles for the cooling of the
vehicle cabin (see US-4 646 535). The refrigerant circuit of these air conditioning
systems is filled with a refrigerant, for example with R 134a
(previously also R 12).In air conditioning systems of this kind there is the
problem that refrigerant must be added from time to time, since
there is the danger when the level is low that the compressor housing
heats up so much that the compressor is damaged or that the lifetime
of the compressor is reduced respectively.An object of the present invention is to provide a method
for the diagnosis of an air conditioning system by means of which a
statement about the degree of filling of the refrigerant circuit can be
made.According to the invention, this object is achieved by a method
according to claim 1. The invention is based on the finding that as the
refrigerant level decreases (or drops below a critical charge limit),
there is a corresponding reduction in the high side pressure peak
after a rapid upstroke. This phenomenon is used to define a critical
charge-peak pressure curve which can be stored in the form of a look-up
table. The method according to the present invention involves
rapidly upstroking a variable displacement compressor, measuring
the associated peak in high side pressure and comparing the value to
the stored values in the look-up table.According to the method of the present invention, the
compressor lifetime can be extended by detecting refrigerant levels
below critical charge which can cause overheating of the compressor.
Thus, the present invention serves as a diagnostic aid for servicing
the air-conditioning system. The present invention also provides a
method for the diagnosis of an air conditioning system which can be
realized with simple technical means. The present invention further
provides a method for the diagnosis of an air conditioning system
which can be carried out in an automated manner.According to the present invention, there is no need for
an evaporator outlet refrigerant temperature or pressure sensor. The
low charge detection can be performed using just a high side pressure
sensor in the

<CLAIMS>
Method for determining the degree of filling of the refrigerant circuit of an air conditioning
system having a condenser (10), an evaporator (14), an expansion device (12) and a

compressor (16), the stroke of which can be set via a valve (20), in said method
a maximum compressor stroke being set abruptly when the air

conditioning system is running, whereupon a pressure impulse which
arises in the high pressure side of the refrigerant circuit is measured

and compared to predetermined values.
Method in accordance with claim 1, with the
maximum compressor stroke being set starting from a minimum

compressor stroke.
Method in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, with
the measured pressure impulse being compared with predetermined

pressure values and a diagnosis report being issued or not in
dependence on this comparison.
Method in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 3,
with the measured pressure impulse being compared with pressure

values which are stored in a look-up table and which are in each case
associated with a specific degree of filling.
Method in accordance with claim 4, with the specific
degree of filling being in dependence on the ambient temperature.
Method in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 5,
with the measured pressure impulse being measured for a

predetermined period of time. 
Method in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 6,
with a critical degree of filling being determined in that a

predetermined temperature of the compressor and/or of the
refrigerant emerging from the compressor is approached.
Method in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 7,
with a solenoid actuated valve being used as the valve.
Method in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 8,
with the control of the valve being done through a pulse width

modulation.
