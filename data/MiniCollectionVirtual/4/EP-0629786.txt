A metal dowel for anchoring in thin wall panels of plasterboard, 
chipboard or the like building material, which is formed by folding 

together a steel sheet portion and which comprises two spreading legs 
(1, 2) which are pressed flat against each other and which are of a 

configuration terminating in a point at the end which is drivable into 
the panel and which are fixedly connected together at the opposite head 

end, wherein said head end is provided with a screwthread region (4) 
which is directed between the spreading legs (1, 2) for screwing in wood 

or self-tapping screws, the screwthread region being followed by an 
opening with a funnel-like outwardly shaped edge configuration for 

insertion of the screw tip, characterised in that the ends of the 
spreading legs (1, 2) which terminate in a point are connected together 

tearably by a thin web portion (3) and the screwthread region (4) is 
formed from two respective holding web portions (5, 6) which are stamped 

out of the leg sheet steel and which engage into the screwthread 
channels of the screw (14) to be screwed in. 
A metal dowel according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
head ends of the two legs (1, 2) are held together by tongues (7) which 

are formed at the head end of the one leg (1) on both sides of the 
screwthread region (4) and which after the spreading legs (1, 2) have 

been folded together are bent over the edge (8) of the other leg (2) and 
pressed together. 
A metal dowel according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein ribs (11) 
which are bent away from each other are formed at the longitudinal sides 

of the spreading legs (1, 2) for stiffening same characterised in that 
the ribs (11) extend as far as the head end and are provided with 

transversely projecting lugs (12).  
 
A metal dowel according to claim 3 characterised in that the 
lugs (12) of adjacent ribs (11) are directed towards each other.
