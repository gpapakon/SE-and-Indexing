15, wherein an inert solvent is used.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
16, wherein an aliphatic hydrocarbon, an aromatic

hydrocarbon, a chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon, a
dipolar aprotic solvent or mixtures of these

solvents are used as the inert solvent.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
17, wherein hexane, heptane or octane is used as the

aliphatic hydrocarbon, toluene or xylene is used as
the aromatic hydrocarbon, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene

or chlorotoluene is used as the chlorinated
