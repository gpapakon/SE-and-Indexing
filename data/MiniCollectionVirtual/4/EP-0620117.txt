<ABSTRACT>
An ink-jet printer has components that are 
constructed to define a curved print zone between the 

print head (45) of the pen (20) and the paper (26). The 
curved print zone effectively lengthens the zone 

otherwise provided by straight or flat print zones and 
provides for greater control of the paper (26) during 

the printing process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to ink-jet printing, 
and particularly to methods and mechanisms for defining 
a curved print zone, through which zone ink is directed 
from an ink-jet pen to paper. Pens used for ink-jet printing are described in 
numerous publications, including U.S. Patent No. 
4,500,895 to Buck et al. The Buck patent describes a 
printing apparatus having a thermal-type print head in 
communication with an ink reservoir. The print head is 
controlled for selectively ejecting ink drops to paper 
to form an image or characters. An ink-jet print head may include an outer layer 
that is designated an orifice plate. The orifice plate 
includes nozzles or orifices formed at least part-way 
through it. Ink is delivered from a storage location in 
the body of the pen through channels formed in the print 
head to connect with each orifice. Drops of ink are 
ejected through the orifices toward the adjacent paper 
or other printing medium. Mechanisms for controlled ejection of ink drops 
through an orifice may include a thin-film resistor, 
which is carried on a print head substrate adjacent to 
the orifice. Whenever a drop of ink is to be ejected 
from the orifice, a current pulse is directed to the 
resistor to ohmically heat the resistor and to vaporize 
a portion of the ink next to the resistor. The 
resultant expansion of the ink portion forces a 
correspondingly sized ink drop through the orifice 
toward the paper. One may characterize the region of space that is 
bounded by the paper and the orifice plate as the print 
zone of the ink-jet pen. In the past, the mechanisms 
for moving the paper through the printer and for moving 
the pen relative to the paper were constructed such that 
the paper was held in a plane parallel to the plane of  
 
the flat orifice plate. Such a print zone, therefore, 
could be characterized as straight. This invention is generally directed to an ink-jet 
printer having components (print head and paper 
path) that are curved to define a curved print zone. 
The curved paper path provides for very precise control 
of the paper motion throughout the print zone. The 
enhanced control of the paper movement is primarily 
attributable to the stiffening of the paper that occurs 
when normally flat paper is bent into a curved 
configuration, thereby increasing the tension on the 
convex side of the curved paper. The increased tension 
in the paper through the curved print zone also tends to 
minimize cockle, which can be described as any unwanted 
paper deformation due to

<CLAIMS>
A printing assembly for a printer, 
comprising: 

   a pen body (32) defining a region to which may 
be attached a print head (45); 

   a print head (45) attached to the region of the 
body (32) and including an outer surface (46) in which 

there is formed orifices (50), the surface being curved; 
and 

   delivery means for delivering the stored ink to 
and out of the orifices (50). 
The assembly of claim 1 further comprising 
paper (26) path means for moving paper (26) past the 

print head (45) in a manner to curve the path taken by 
the paper (26) as the paper (26) moves adjacent to the 

print head. 
The system of claim 2 wherein the outer 
surface (46) of the print head (45) is curved by an 

amount that substantially matches the amount of 
curvature of the paper (26) adjacent to the print head. 
The system of claim 3 wherein the outer 
surface (46) is concave. 
The system of claim 3 wherein the outer 
surface (46) is convex. 
The system of claim 2 further comprising: 
   a second pen (20) having a body (32), the second 

pen being mounted adjacent to the first-mentioned pen in 
the direction of the paper (26) path; 

   a second print head (45) attached to the second 
pen body (32) and having an outer surface (46), the 

outer surface of the second print head (45) having 
orifices (50) formed therein through which ink may be 

projected; and wherein
 

   the printer means further selectively projects 
drops of ink through the orifices (50) in the second 

print head. 
The system of claim 2 wherein the paper (26) 
path means includes tensioning means for applying 

lateral tension to the paper (26) in the vicinity of the 
print head (45). 
A method of manufacturing a print head (45) 
for an ink-jet pen (20) comprising the steps of: 

   providing a pen body (32); 
   constructing a print head (45) to have a curved 

outer surface (46) through which curved surface there is 

formed orifices (50); and 
   attaching the print head (45) to the pen body 

(32) so that ink may flow through the print head and out 
of the orifices (50) in the outer surface (46) of the 

print head. 
The method of claim 8 wherein the 
constructing step includes shaping the print head (45) 

to have a concavely shaped outer surface (46).
