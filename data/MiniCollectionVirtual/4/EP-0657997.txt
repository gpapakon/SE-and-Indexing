<ABSTRACT>
The method relates to automatic control of the gain of a digital radio receiver including an intermediate frequency amplification chain (2 ... 11) coupled to an analog-digital converter (12). It consists in measuring (17, 19), the high-frequency energy and the energy of the signal applied by the intermediate-frequency amplification chain to the analog-digital converter (12), in measuring the low-frequency energy of the output signal from the receiver, and in controlling the gain of the intermediate-frequency amplification chain on the basis of the high-frequency and low-frequency energies of the signal. Application: Digital radio receiver.

Method for automatically controlling the gain of
a digital radio receiver, including an intermediate-frequency

amplification system (2... 11) coupled to an
analog/digital converter (12), consisting in measuring

(17, 19) the high-frequency energy in the signal applied
by the intermediate-frequency amplification system to the

analog/digital converter (12) and in measuring, after
channel filtering, the low-frequency energy of the output

signal of the receiver, characterized in that it consists
in controlling the gain of the intermediate-frequency

amplification system on the basis of the high-frequency
and low-frequency energies of the signal by comparing the

current high-frequency energy with an energy threshold
value Ref determined as a function of the high-frequency

energy of the signal applied to the analog/digital
converter (12).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in

that the measurement of the low-frequency energy of the
signal is measured after digitally filtering (13) the

samples of signal supplied by the analog/digital converter
(12).
Method according to either one of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that it consists in updating the energy

reference value Ref as a function of the high-frequency
energy of the signal applied to the analog/digital

converter (12).
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that it consists in reducing the gain of the amplification

system when the current average high-frequency
energy is greater than at least the first determined 

threshold value "threshold H" greater than the energy
reference value Ref.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that it consists in equalizing the energy reference value

Ref with the value of the high-frequency energy measured
when the latter is between the first determined threshold

value "threshold H" and the current energy reference
value Ref.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that it consists in increasing (31) the gain of the

intermediate-frequency system when the measured high-frequency
energy is less than the energy reference value

Ref.
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in
that it consists in comparing (53) the measured current

low-frequency energy with a minimum level value in order
to multiply the samples of signal supplied by the low-frequency

digital filtering (13) by a maximum gain value
(54) when the measured low-frequency energy is greater

than tile minimum level value.
Method according to Claim 7, characterized in
that it consists in multiplying the samples of signal

supplied by the low-frequency digital filtering (13) by
an intermediate gain value (55) when the measured low-frequency

energy is less than or equal to the minimum
level value.
Method according to either one of Claims 7 and 8,
characterized in that the minimum level value is equal to

the measured low-frequency energy value divided (53) by
the maximum allowed low-frequency gain.
Method according to any one of Claims 4 to 9,
characterized in that the measuring speed of the low-frequency

energy is correlated with the slow or abrupt
variation in the low-frequency energy.
Method according to either one of Claims 9 and
10, characterized in that the measured low-frequency

energy value is reduced (26) when the measured high-frequency
energy is greater than the first threshold H

(24). 
Method according to Claim 11, characterized in
that the measured low-frequency energy value is increased

(31) when the measured high-frequency energy is less than
the reference threshold Ref.
Receiver for implementing the method according to
any one of Claims 1 to 12, characterized in that it

comprises a first device (16) for automatically controlling
the gain of the intermediate-frequency system, this

device being programmed as a function of the energy of
the signal supplied by the analog/digital converter (12)

placed at the output of the intermediate-frequency system
(2...11), and a second device (18) for automatically

controlling the gain of the level of the samples supplied
by a digital filter (13) placed at the output of the

analog/digital converter (12) in order to control the
level of the samples as a function of the low-frequency

and high-frequency energy of the signal applied to the
analog/digital converter (12).
