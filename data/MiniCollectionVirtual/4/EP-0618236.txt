<ABSTRACT>
A method for recovering cyclodextrin from an 
inclusion compound of cyclodextrin with a guest 

compound, comprising passing an aqueous solution 
containing the inclusion compound through a non-polar, 

high-porous hydrophobic adsorption resin having styrene 
as a basic skeleton, preferably a cross-linked copolymer 

of styrene with divinylbenzene, such that the adsorption 
resin preferentially adsorbs the guest compound 

resulting in its removal from the solution. The method 
enables economical recovery of cyclodextrin in a good 

efficiency and at a high purity from inclusion compounds 
of cyclodextrin with guest compounds such as cholesterol 

and other lipids.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for recovering
cyclodextrin (hereinafter "CD") from inclusion compounds
(or clathrate compounds) of CD with a guest compound.
More particularly, it is concerned with a method for
recovering CD from inclusion compounds of CD with
cholesterol and/or other lipids, formed as by-products
during the preparation of cholesterol reduced edible fats,
oils or eggs, which method comprising removing cholesterol
and/or other lipids from edible fats, and oils or egg yolk
by the aid of CD.In recent years, an increase in the ingestion of
food with a high cholesterol has caused a serious increase
in adult diseases such as arteriosclerosis and
hypertension due to hypercholesterolemia. Under such
circumstances, it is strongly sought to develop food with
a low cholesterol content. In particular, with regard to animal
fats and oils such as butter or eggs, which are pointed
out as high-cholesterol foods, it is desired to remove
cholesterol contained therein. As methods therefor, in recent years, methods in
which inclusion compounds with cholesterol are formed
using various types of CD, in particular, β-CD composed of
7 molecules of glucose in order to remove cholesterol from
the foods are proposed, and have been already put into
practical use (see Japanese Patent Applications Laid-open
No. 63-41595, No. 3-14896, No. 3-49647, No. 3-130039, No.
4-93399 and No. 4-229158, W091-16824, and USP5,063,077).EP-A-0440538 discloses a process for the treatment of complexes of cyclodextrin with
lipophilic substances, which comprises heat treating an aqueous solution of the
complexes followed by separation of the phases by decantation or centrifugation.GB 1238001 discloses pharmaceutical compositions for use in the treatment or
control of cholesterol and/or lipid levels in the blood comprising a non-ionic cross-linked
polystyrene resin capable of adsorbing bile acids.These methods have made it easy to produce low-cholesterol
foods. However, there is almost no report of
methods by which CD is recovered in a good efficiency from
inclusion compounds of CD with cholesterol and other
lipids, obtained as by-products.Accordingly, a method in which an aqueous suspension
of such inclusion compounds is heated to dissociate them
into CD, and cholesterol and other lipids, followed by
centrifugal separation to recover the respective
components has been hitherto employed for the sake of
convenience (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 3-14896).In order to recover CD in a higher purity, a method
is also proposed in
