<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device, comprising at least two components, designed to detect whether an object, in particular a vehicle, to which one of the two components is fitted, is stolen or not. The invention calls for the object to be fitted with a passive transponder which, on reception of an activation signal periodically transmitted by a monitoring station, sends back an encoded signal which is checked for validity by the monitoring unit. If the encoded signal from the obect is valid, the person with the protected object is asked to provide a personal code corresponding to the transponder fitted to the object. The personal code is in turn checked for validity by the monitoring unit and the result and optionally also any further developments in the checking procedure are presented on a display.
