<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the purification 
of a polluted liquid, especially a washing liquid used at 

a washing installation, by sucking the polluted liquid and 
leading it through at least one filter and next leading back 

the liquid purified thus to a take-off point, whereby the 
liquid flow carried through the filter is maintained at a 

substantially constant level. 
The invention further relates to an apparatus for 
carrying out said method comprising a suction line connected 

to a source of polluted liquid, a discharge line for the 
purified liquid debouching at a take-off point, at least one 

filter unit positioned between the suction line and the 
discharge line, a pump connected therewith in series and 

means for limiting the amount of liquid flowing across the 
filter unit, said means being positioned in series with the 

filter unit. 
The described method and apparatus allow large savings 
on the amount of washing liquid required for operating 

a washing installation and lead to a considerably decreased 
environmental charge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the 
purification of a polluted liquid, especially a washing liquid 
used at a washing installation. Up to now it is common practice that in washing installations, 
such as car washes, the used washing liquid is 
collected in a collecting reservoir, and next, after the 
removal of oil and/or grease, is discharged at a sewer, whereas 
the washing installation is operated with clean water 
supplied by the public mains system. It is a disadvantage of 
this known method that the operating costs of the washing 
installation are high, because of the large need of fresh 
water. Further the environment is heavily charged, while the 
costs originating therefrom are increasingly charged to the 
polluter, i.e. the owner or user of the washing installation. 
Further water of the mains system is "unnecessary" pure 
and thus relatively expensive for non-consumptive applications. It is an object of the invention to remove these disadvantages. 
This goal is achieved by sucking the polluted 
liquid and leading it through at least one filter and next 
leading back the liquid purified thus to a take-off point. 
Consequently the liquid can be used again such that the operative 
costs of the washing installation and the environmental 
charge originating therefrom can be diminished, without 
negatively influencing the operation of the washing installation. Advantageously applied ways of carrying out the above-mentioned 
method are subject of the dependent claims 2 
until 4. The invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying 
out the above-mentioned method. According to the invention 
such an apparatus comprises a suction line connected to 
a source of polluted liquid, a discharge line for the purified 
liquid debouching at a take-off point, at least one 
filter unit positioned between the suction line and discharge 
line and a pump connected therewith in series. A proper purifying operation is obtained, when the 
filter unit comprises a number of parallel cylindrical filter  
 
elements extending into the direction of flow, the cylinder 
wall of each of which being permeable to liquid but 
not permeable to pollution particles present in the liquid. 
In this aspect preferably the cross-section of each cylindrical 
filter element is substantially smaller than the 
cross-section of the suction and discharge lines. Applying 
such a filter unit, also indicated as micro filter, a very 
good purification is obtained at a relatively low pumping 
power. Preferably the apparatus
