<ABSTRACT>
Reinforced polymer composites having a uniform 
mixture of reinforcing fibers having a polymodal 

length distribution and having polymer particulates 

are provided exhibiting a good balance of impact 
strength and processability/ formability. The 

composites are prepared by forming a dilute aqueous 
slurry of a solid heat-fusible organic polymer and 

a reinforcing material having a polymodal length 
distribution, agitating the slurry and then 

dewatering the slurry to provide a mat of 
thermoplastic polymer particles and reinforcing 

fiber. The mat is dried and then stamped under 
pressure and heat to consolidate the thermoplastic 

material and form a sheet-like composite structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fiber 
reinforced thermoplastic composites, and more 
particularly relates to thermoplastic composites 
having reinforcing fibers which have a polymodal 
distribution. Aqueous methods of making fiber reinforced 
composite materials from an aqueous slurry of, 
solid polymer and reinforcing material are known. 
See Published European Patent Applications 
0,148,760 and 0,148,761, Wessling et al., U.S. 
Patent No. 4,426,470 issued January 17, 1984 and 
Gatward et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,716,449 issued 
February 13, 1973, all of which are incorporated 
herein by reference. In general these reinforced 
polymer composites have a uniform mixture of fiber, 
polymer and optionally binder and are prepared by 
performing dilute aqueous slurries of a solid heat-fusible 
organic polymer, a reinforcing material and 
optionally a latex binder. Reinforcing materials disclosed have included 
organic and inorganic products such as graphite, 
metal fibers, aromatic polyamides, cellulose and 
polyolefin fibers, and typically have included 
glass fibers such as chopped glass strands having a  
 
length of 1/8 to 1 inch (about 3.2 to 25.4 mm) or 
milled glass fibers which generally have a length 
of about 1/32 to 1/8 inch (about 0.79 to 3.2 mm). 
These reinforcing fibers have typically involved 
unimodal fiber distributions resulting in the final 
composite article after having been stamped under 
high pressures and at elevated temperatures 
exhibiting a relatively low impact strength if 
short fibers are employed exclusively, and 
exhibiting an undesirably high resistance to flow 
during stamping at elevated temperatures if 
relatively long fibers are used exclusively. Accordingly, there is a need for thermoplastic 
composites and processes for the making thereof, 
which result in thermoplastic sheet-like structures 
which exhibit desired levels of flow during 
stamping at elevated temperatures and pressures, 
and which exhibit desired levels of impact strength 
in the final composite article. This invention provides a process for making. 
reinforced thermoplastic composites which comprises 
forming a dilute aqueous slurry of a solid, water-insoluble, 
heat-fusible organic polymer in 
particulate form and a reinforcing material having 
a polymodal length distribution, collecting the 
solids in the form of a continuous sheet or mat, 
dewatering, drying and stamping at an elevated 
temperature and pressure. The invention also provides reinforced 
thermoplastic composites comprising a
