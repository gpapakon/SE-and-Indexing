<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive article comprising a plurality of 

abrasive particles bonded together, bonded into a 
substrate, or bonded onto a backing by a cured binder, 

the cured binder being formed by solidifying a binder 
precursor comprising an aqueous acrylate polymer 

emulsion. In preferred embodiments, the binder 
precursor includes a phenolic resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to abrasive articles. Abrasive articles typically comprise a plurality 
of abrasive particles and a binder. There are a number 
of different types of abrasive articles on the market. 
These include (1) coated abrasive articles, in which 
the binder bonds the abrasive particles to a backing 
material (e.g., "sandpaper"), (2) lapping coated 
abrasive articles, in which the abrasive particles are 
first dispersed in a binder precursor and the resulting 
dispersion is bonded to a backing material, (3) bonded 
abrasive articles, in which the binder bonds the 
abrasive particles together to form a shaped mass, 
e.g., a grinding wheel, and (4) nonwoven abrasive 
articles, in which the binder bonds the abrasive 
particles into a nonwoven fibrous substrate. The binder of the abrasive article is typically 
formed by curing a binder precursor, which is in liquid 
form. The binder precursor typically comprises a 
resin. During the manufacture of the abrasive article, 
the binder precursor is exposed to an energy source, 
which results in the polymerisation of the resin, 
thereby forming the binder. The energy source can 
provide thermal energy, or radiation energy, e.g., 
electron beam, ultraviolet light, or visible light. In 
recent years, radiation-curable resins have been 
employed because of their advantages over thermally-curable 
resins, e.g., faster cure times, lower capital 
investments in buildings and equipment, and lower  
 
energy costs. Examples of radiation-curable resins are 
acrylate-based resins. The high viscosity of many radiation-curable 
resins tends to cause processing problems. 
Accordingly, organic solvents or diluents are sometimes 
added to lower the viscosity of binder precursors that 
comprise radiation-curable resins. However, removal 
and recovery of organic solvents is expensive, and 
solvents and diluents pose safety and environmental 
concerns. Radiation-curable resins have been combined with 
thermally-curable resins, e.g., phenolics, to improve 
the properties of the binder. The invention provides an abrasive article having 
improved grinding properties. The abrasive article 
comprises a plurality of abrasive particles either 
bonded together by a binder or bonded into or onto a 
substrate by a binder. The binder is formed by curing 
a binder precursor that comprises an aqueous acrylate 
polymer emulsion. The use of an aqueous acrylate 
polymer emulsion provides the binder with excellent 
properties, including enhanced strength for superior 
grinding. The
