<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the use of
leukaemia inhibitory factor and pharmaceutical
compositions comprising same in the treatment of
undifferentiated tumours and sarcomas in mammals. The
present invention is particularly directed to the
treatment of Ewing's Sarcoma, Rhabdosarcoma and other
sarcomas of connective tissue, bones, bladder, kidneys,
liver, lungs, parotids or spleen.Leukaemia inhibitory factor (hereinafter referred to as
"LIF") was purified (1,2) and cloned (3) on the basis of
its capacity to induce differentiation in and suppress
the M1 mouse myeloid leukaemic cell line (see WO-A-88/07548)
and
has been shown to possess a variety of actions: it
releases calcium from bone tissues (5), is the factor
preventing spontaneous differentiation in normal
embryonic stem cells (6,7), is a molecule stimulating
DA1 cell proliferation (4), stimulates liver cells to
produce acute phase proteins (8,9), and is a lipoprotein
lipase inhibitor (10).Lowe et al. (1991, J. Bone Miner. Res., 6(12), p. 1277-1283)
and Allan et al. (1990, J. Cell Physiol., 145(1),
p. 110-119) describe the effects of LIF on the
osteogenic sarcoma cell line, UMR-106. Although in both
cases the researchers were studying osteoblast behaviour
or structure, on this particular cell line Lowe et al.
found that LIF inhibited purification in contrast to
stimulatory effects on primary cultures of osteoblasts.
These actions were unable to determine which of these
contrasting in vitro effects were relevant in vivo.The present invention arose in part from an
investigation of the effect of LIF on Ewing's Sarcoma,
the second most common malignant bone tumour of children
and young adults, accounting for approximately 7% of all
malignant tumours of bone. The predominant localisation
of these tumours is in the metaphyses of long bone and
the pelvic region, although the extremities, ribs and
spine or any other bone may be affected and they can
also metastise to the lungs.Macroscopically, the tumours are a jelly-like mass with
foci of haemorrhage on their cut surface.
Microscopically, they are made up of sheets of densely
packed, undifferentiated, small round cells, divided
into small groups or nests by fibrous-tissue septa.With current treatment, patients with small localised
tumours have an approximately 50% chance of survival,
however, those with large or metastatic tumours have a
poor prognosis (12). Recent studies have demonstrated
that Ewing's Sarcoma cells have the capacity to undergo
differentiation into neural cells, suggesting
