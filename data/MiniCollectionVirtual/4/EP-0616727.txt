<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor substrate material having a
photovoltaic cell, a semiconductor substrate material having an integrated array of at
least two photovoltaic cells in electrical series with one another, systems for the
production of electricity and methods for the production of electricity.One proposed method for reducing the cost of photovoltaic energy conversion is
to deposit the photovoltaic solar cells in the form of a thin sheet onto a supporting
substrate such as glass. Such sheets can be deposited more or less continuously onto a
moving substrate or by other methods. Techniques are then required to define
individual cells within this deposited sheet and to provide for their electrical
interconnection.US-4,295,002 describes a solar cell with grooves provided in it. In one example,
two grooves are provided with the one on the left having a p-type dopant and the one on
the right having a n-type dopant. The grooves are metalised to provide a series of
connection between adjacent cells.It would be advantageous at least from a manufacturing viewpoint if the
individual cells in the substrate cell were such that they could be fabricated in a wide
range of substrate materials, deposition conditions and cell designs. It would also be
advantageous if the inherent features of cells permitted relatively large area individual
cells and large scale integrated arrays of cells to be fabricated.It is an object of this invention to provide a semiconductor substrate material
having a photovoltaic cell, and, a semiconductor substrate material having an integrated
array of at least two photovoltaic cells in electrical series with one another.Other objects are to provide systems for the production of electricity and
methods for the production of electricity.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a solar cell
having: 
a plurality of layers of alternate p-type and n-type doped semiconductor material
defining one or more p-n junctions; andtwo contact structures formed in grooves extending to contact the plurality of
doped layers, semiconductor surfaces of the groove of a first of the contact structures
being doped with an n-type dopant, semiconductor surfaces of the groove of the second
of the contact structures being doped with a p-type dopant and each groove containing a
conducting material in conducting electrical contact with the respective doped surfaces
of the groove, the first contact structure providing an electrical connection with the n-type
doped layers and
