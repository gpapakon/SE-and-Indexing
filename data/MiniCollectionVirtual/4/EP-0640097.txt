<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR VACCINATION AGAINST CORONAVIRUSES<?*.-.Cross-Reference to Related Applications 5 This is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S. patent application Serial No. 07/882,171, filed May 8, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Serial No. 07/698,927, filed May 13, 1991, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Serial No. 10 07/613,066, filed November 14, 1990.Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to compositions useful for vaccination against, and treatment of, coronavirus infections, as well as methods for using these 15 compositions.Background of the InventionFeline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV) is a coronavirus which causes a highly lethal immune complexing disease in cats. The exact mechanism(s) of FIP disease20 pathogenesis is not understood, but lesions are found in all major internal organs due to the deposition of immune complexes. Several strains of FIPV have been isolated from diseased cats. Some are highly virulent and cause disease after a primary infection (Type II) . Other virulent25 strains (Type I) cannot initiate disease unless the cat has been previously exposed to FIPV.Another feline coronavirus other than FIPV is known. Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) was isolated from cats but differs in pathogenesis from FIPV. For example, FECV,30 in contrast to FIPV, specifically infects intestinal epithelial cells and causes only a mild enteritis in cats. In addition, FECV has not been reported to sensitize cats to disease following challenge with FIPV. 

 Other coronaviruses have been isolated from other animal species, i.e., transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) , porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) , bovine coronavirus (BCV) , avian coronavirus (ACV) , murine coronavirus (MCV) and human coronavirus (HCV) . However, these coronaviruses do not share the same pathogenesis as FIPV. As with FECV, these other coronaviruses cause either respiratory or mild gastroenteritis illnesses.Coronaviruses encode three structural proteins: S - surface glycoprotein or spike; M - the envelope matrix protein; and N - the nucleoprotein which interacts with the RNA genome to make the viral capsid. The S protein induces an immune response including the production of neutralizing antibodies following infection. It is also responsible for attachment to infected cells and mediates cell fusion, aiding spread of the virus. Thus the S protein is the primary focus for effective coronavirus vaccine development
