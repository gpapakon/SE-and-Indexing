<ABSTRACT>
A high capacity sheet stacking system for stacking substantial quantities of the 
sequential sheet output (14) of a reproducing apparatus on a sheet stacking tray (18) providing 

an inclined sheet stacking surface (18a) at a substantial angle from the horizontal for receiving 
and registering sheets against an upstanding stack edge registration or alignment surface (32). 

Here, this stack edge alignment surface is automatically varied in height above the stacking 
surface with the change in stack (22) height in the tray, in coordination with vertical 

repositioning of the sheet input (20) level to the tray with stack height, so that an elevator 
system is not required for the stacking tray, and a simple fixed position tray may be used, yet 

high sheet stacking capacity provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sheet stacking and registration system, and is particularly 
concerned with a high capacity sheet stacker of a reproduction apparatus. By way of background, as is well known in the art, and further discussed 
hereinbelow, for better stacking registration, it is desirable to sequentially deposit the 
outputted sheets onto an inclined surface. Initially this is the inclined sheet stacking surface of 
the empty stacking tray, and then it is the correspondingly inclined upper surface of the sheets 
previously stacked thereon. If the stacking tray surface is upwardly inclined relative to the 
sheet input into the tray, this is known in the art as "uphill" stacking. It is called "downhill" 
stacking if the stacking tray slopes downwardly away from the sheet input. There are many 
advantages to using either "uphill" or "downhill" stacking, either for stacking per se, or for 
stacking in a compiler for stapling or other binding or finishing. It allows different sizes of 
sheets to be stacked using the same paper path and the same tray system, using gravity assisted 
stacking against a simple inboard (see below) or outboard registration wall or surface, and 
therefore, is relatively less expensive than more complicated active stacking 
registration/alignment systems, such as those requiring scuffers, flappers, tampers, joggers, 
etc., although the latter can be additionally provided for stacking and registration assistance. "Uphill" stacking desirably lends itself to stacking registration at an inboard end or 
side of a reproduction machine and/or a connecting modular stacking unit. That is, at the sheet 
input side of the stacking tray. It thereby reduces cantilever forces on cantilevered stacking 
trays. It also automatically slows down the ejected sheets, due to their initial "uphill" 
movement. The sheets then reverse their movement to slide back down against an upstanding 
wall or edge adjacent to but underlying the sheet ejection slot or nip. Incoming sheets thus 
cannot stub on the end of the stack in the tray, if the further sheets enter above the top sheet 
of the stack, which of course rises with the stack level. As noted above, it is well known in the art to provide a stacking system with a stack 
elevator [see art cited below]. Thereby the stacking tray is maintained at a suitable height for 
such stacking, by the stacking tray and all its contents being moved downwardly vertically as 
the stack therein accumulates, so that the top of the stack remains in the same general

A high capacity sheet stacking and registration system (10; 11) for stacking output 
sheets (14) of a reproduction apparatus in at least one stacking tray (18) wherein said stacking tray 

(18) is inclined so that sheets. (14) stacked therein move towards a stacking end for stacking 
registration; the system (10; 11) comprising: 


a sheet input feeder (20) for feeding sheets (14) into said stacking tray (18) for stacking
