<ABSTRACT>
A cable connector combination wherein the cable has an 
electrically conductive core and an extra-thick insulating sheath. 

There is a terminal fitting which includes a wire barrel and an 
insulator barrel. The former grips the exposed length of bare wire 

core and the latter grips a reduced diameter portion of the sheath. 
The exposed length is formed by stripping the insulation 
completely from one end, and the reduced diameter portion of the 

sheath is formed by stripping part of the insulation from the 
cable, preferably at a point adjacent the exposed length. The 

reduced diameter is the same as the outer diameter of a normal 
sized cable and, therefore, will fit easily and readily into the 

standard insulator barrel. Thus, no special fittings are required, 
and the abrasion-resistant cables can be handled along with all of 

the others. An apparatus for carrying out the method is also 
disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric cable for 
a connector, the cable being connected to a terminal 
fitting of the connector and a method and apparatus for its 
production. In making a connection between an electric cable 40 and 
a connector 50 a known general configuration is shown in 
Fig. 7. which is used for automobiles. The electric cable 
40 comprises core wires 41 covered with an insulation 
covering 42. In making the connection, firstly an 
insulation covering at the tip is uncovered with a 
stripping machine to expose the core wire 41. Furtheron, a 
caulking is made so as to have the insulation barrel 44 of 
the terminal fitting 46 hold the tip of the insulation 
covering 42 of the electric cable 40 and have the wire 
barrel 45 hold the core wire 41 of the electric cable 40 to 
fasten the terminal fitting 46 to the tip of the electric 
cable 40, thereby fastening the terminal fitting 46 to the 
tip part of the electric cable 40. The electric cable 40 
thus having the terminal fitting 46 fastened is inserted 
into the cavity 47 in the connector housing 48, and then, 
the terminal fitting 46 is fixed in the connector housing 
48 in such a state that the tip part of the insulation 
covering 42 is advanced into the cavity 47 in the housing 
48. Depending on the position at which the connector for 
automobile is used, an abrasion resistant electric cable 
may have to be used. As such a cable has thick insulation  
 
covering, the outer diametrical size of the whole electric 
cable inevitably becomes larger. For this reason, with the 
connector housing having a normal specification, it is 
impossible to have the tip part of such an abrasion 
resistant electric cable advance into the cavity, and it is 
not possible to provide the insulation barrel part of the 
terminal fitting with crimping onto the insulation 
covering. Accordingly, there have been such problems that 
the connector housing or the terminal fitting has to be 
redesigned to the size of the cable or fine normal cable 
has to be connected to the tip of the coarse abrasion 
resistant cable through a splicing terminal. The present invention was made to cope with the 
situation as mentioned above, and therefore its objects are 
to provide an electric cable for connector which allow 
connection to the connector having a normal specification 
even in case the thickness of the insulation covering is 
larger, and a method and apparatus for its production. The electric cable for a connector according to the 
present invention as defined

<CLAIMS>
An electric cable (20) for a connector, said cable comprising 
a conductive core (21) covered with an 

insulation covering (22), a portion of said conductive 
core and of said insulation covering passing into said 

connector, 
characterised in that
 
the diameter of the insulation covering (22) of the 

portion (23) of the cable (20) positioned in said 
connector (11) is smaller than that of the rest of the 

cable (20). 
An electric cable according to claim 1, further 
characterised in that said insulation covering (22) is 

a synthetic resin. 
A method for producing an electric cable (20) for a 
connector, said cable comprising a conductive core (21) 

covered with an insulation covering (22), a portion of 
said conductive core and of said insulation covering 

passing into said connector, said method comprising the 
steps of: 


i) stripping the insulation covering (22) from an end 
portion of said cable (20) so as to expose the core 

wires (21); and 
ii) cutting only the periphery of the portion (23) of 
the insulation covering (22) which is inserted into 

the connector housing (11), so as to make the 
diametrical size of the insulation covering (22) of 

said portion (23) smaller than that of the rest of 
the cable (20). 
The method of claim 4, characterized in that steps i) 
and ii) are carried out simultaneously.  

 
An apparatus for stripping insulation from an electric 
cable (20), said cable (20) comprising a conductive 

core (21) covered with an insulation covering (22), 
said apparatus comprising: 


clamp and holding means (32, 33) for holding and 
positioning said cable (20) in a fixed position; 
cutter support means (35) movable mounted with respect 
to said cable (20);

said cutter support means (35) to cut through the 

insulation covering (22) on said cable (20) with 
different depths, through to the wire core (21) of the 

cable (20) at a tip portion of the cable (20) and with 
a depth smaller than the total thickness of the 

insulation covering (22) at a portion (23) further away 
from the tip portion of the cable (20), 
whereby movement of said cutter support means (35) 
removes said insulation covering (22) totally the tip 

portion of said cable (20) to expose the core wire (21) 
and partially at the portion (23) of said cable (20) 

subsequent to said tip portion, enabling said portion 
(23) to be smaller in diameter than the rest of said 

insulation covering (22).

cutter support means comprises two cutter supporting 

arms (35) arranged adjacent each other and movably 
mounted on sliding shafts (34), allowing translational 

movement of the two cutter supporting arms (35)
