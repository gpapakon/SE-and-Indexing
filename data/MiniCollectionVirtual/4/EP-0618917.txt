<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 1'-amino-2-[(benzothiazolyl)methyl)spiro[isoquinoline-4(1H),3'-pyrrolidine]-1,2',3,5'(2H)-tetrones 
and analogs 
thereof and their pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts , to processes for their preparation, to methods for using the 
compounds, and to pharmaceutical preparations thereof. The compounds have 
pharmaceutical properties which render them beneficial for the prevention or treatment 
of complications associated with diabetes mellitus. The use of insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agents in the treatment of diabetes 
mellitus has prolonged the life of many of these patients. However, their use has not 
had a demonstrable impact on the development of diabetic complications such as 
neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, cataracts and vascular disease which accompany 
the underlying metabolic disorder. There is little question that chronic hyperglycemia 
plays a major role in the genesis of these complications, and that complete 
normalization of blood glucose would likely prevent most if not all complications. For 
a number of reasons, though, chronic normalization of blood glucose has not been 
achieved with the currently available therapies. The long-term complications of diabetes develop in tissues where glucose 
uptake is independent of insulin. In these tissues, which include the lens, retina, 
kidney and peripheral nerves, the systemic hyperglycemia of diabetes is rapidly 
transposed into high tissular concentrations of glucose. In all of these tissues this 
excess glucose is rapidly metabolized by the sorbitol pathway. The intense diabetes-induced 
flux of glucose through this pathway appears to initiate a cascade of 
biochemical alterations which slowly progress to cell dysfunction and structural 
damage. Aldose reductase, the key enzyme in the sorbitol pathway, reduces glucose to 
sorbitol at the expense of the cofactor NADPH. In animal models of diabetes, 
compounds which inhibit aldose reductase have been shown to prevent the 
biochemical, functional and morphological changes induced by hyperglycemia. Early 
studies by J. H. Kinoshita and collaborators implicated aldose reductase in the etiology 
of diabetic cataracts. More recent studies have provided compelling evidence that 
aldose reductase also plays a significant role in the initiation of diabetic nephropathy,  
 
retinopathy and neuropathy (cf McCaleb et al, J Diab. Comp., 2, 16, 1989; Robinson et 
al, Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci., 30., 2285, 1989; Novvest and Inserra, Diabetes, 36,
