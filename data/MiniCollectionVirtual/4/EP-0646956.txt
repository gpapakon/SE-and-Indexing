<ABSTRACT>
The reliability of integrated circuits fabricated with trench 
isolation is improved by increasing the thickness of the gate 

dielectric overlying the trench corner. After the trench isolation 
region (40, 56) has been formed a thin layer of silicon dioxide 

(44) is chemically vapor deposited over the trench isolation 
region (44) and the adjacent active region (23). A transistor gate 

electrode (46) is subsequently formed over the thin layer of 
silicon dioxide (44). The thin layer of silicon dioxide (44) 

increases the thickness of the gate dielectric that lies between 
the transistor gate electrode (46) and the trench corner, and 

therefore the breakdown voltage of the gate dielectric at the 
trench corner is increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to semiconductor devices, 
and more specifically to a method of formation of a trench isolation structure in an 
integrated circuit. The semiconductor industry continually strives to increase 
device performance and device density by reducing device 
dimensions. For a given chip size, device density can be increased 
by reducing the lateral distance separating active devices, or the 
device isolation width. The desire to reduce device isolation 
width, while maintaining the necessary electrical isolation 
between adjacent active devices, has led to the development of 
several different isolation schemes. One technique which as been proposed for device isolation in 
high density integrated circuits is trench isolation. With trench 
isolation, field oxide encroachment of the surrounding active 
regions is eliminated, and therefore device isolation width can be 
reduced. Unfortunately, integrated circuits fabricated with 
existing trench isolation schemes often suffer from premature 
gate oxide breakdown, and thus have poor reliability. One reason 
for the premature breakdown is that gate oxide grown near the 
trench corner has a lower breakdown voltage as compared to that 
grown in other areas. This is because near the trench corner the 
silicon substrate oxidizes at a slower rate during gate oxidation, 
and this results in the gate oxide being thinner near the trench 
corner, as compared to that grown in other areas. In addition, due 
to the abrupt profile of the trench corner, high electric fields are 
generated near the trench edge during device operation, and these 
high electric fields further degrade the breakdown voltage of the 
thinned gate oxide. Accordingly, a need exists for a trench  
 
isolation structure that allows high density integrated circuits to be fabricated 
with improved reliability. Japanese Patent Publication Number 3-101147 (1991) describes a 
method of forming a semiconductor device having trench field isolation 
regions and transistors. The silicon oxide film 7 of the trench field isolation 
regions extend to significantly higher elevations compared to the active 
regions of the transistors. A gate oxide film 10 is formed over active regions. 
Spacers 9, which are not part of the gate dielectric, are formed over the gate 
oxide film 10. Gate electrodes 11 are then formed over the gate oxide film 10 
and the spacers 9. The spacers significantly reduce the channel width of the 
transistor. This is undesired because the narrower channel width gives
