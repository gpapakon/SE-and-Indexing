<ABSTRACT>
This invention, called an Information Router, holds a microprocessor-based control unit that is designed to be able to connect to one or more computers, a telephone, one or more telephone lines and one or more printers. The control unit has a built-in, afterwards added and/or the ability to attach an external, document scanner (14) and it can also be equipped with an internal data- and fax-modem (3). The Information Router can help attached external units to be used selectively for copying from scanner to printer, for receiving incoming and sending outgoing telefaxes and to print out and input data to/from an attached external computer.

<DESCRIPTION>
Information RouterThis invention is called an Information Router and holds a microprocessor- based control unit that is connected to one or more computers, a telephone, one or more telephone lines and one or more printers. The control unit has a built-in, or an afterwards added, or the ability to attach an external scanner and it can also be equipped with an internal modem and fax-modem.The Information Router is a machine that, without support from externally attached computers of any kind, will supervise and control the usage of the units attached to the Information Router so that those are used in an efficie way.A purpose of the invention is to be able to make use of the built-in, built-on or externally attached scanner for reading of documents that are selectively used for sending telefaxes, for copying through an attached printer or for da input to an attached computer. Another purpose of the invention is to be abl to use an attached printer selectively for receiving and printout of telefax from the telephone line, for printouts from a computer or for copying from t scanner. Further purposes and functions of the Information Router can be understood from the description below.The drawing shows one version of the Information Router according to the invention. It consists of a microprocessor-based control unit that is connected to one or more computers, a telephone, one or more telephone lines and one or more printers. The control unit has a built-in, or an afterwards added, or the ability to attach an external scanner, and an intern data- and fax-modem. The Information Router can also be equipped with a control panel B with a number of control keys and a display 13, including th necessary control logic. The control panel B is, however, not necessary sinc its functions also can be controlled from software in a computer attached to the control unit A. 

The control unit A is built around a microprocessor with CPU 1 , a data- and address bus 8, RAM 5 and RAM card expansion capabilities 51, a program in ROM 2 and an ability to add extra programs in ROM 21. Attached to the data- and address bus 8 is a parallel logic circuit 6 with inputs 61, 62 for computer 1 and 2, respectively, and with outputs 63 and 64 for printers 1 and 2, respectively. Attached to the bus is also serial logic circuits 7 for connection to and communication with printer 71 , printer port on computer 72, computer port for modem and fax 73 and control panel 74. A 9600 baud faxmodem/datamodem 3 with an amplifier 31 and a loudspeaker 32 is

Claims
1. Information Router intended to be able to be connected to at least one graphic printer and at least one telephone line, distinguished by the fa that the unit is able to hold or attach a built-in, an afterwards added, and/or an external, scanner. The Information Router consists of a microprocessor-based control unit (A), designed and programmed to convert and route information in such a way that one or several documents can be scanned and, through conversion from scanner for to a format suitable for printout, a copy can be printed out by the print The Information Router is also designed to be able to connect an external computer equipment, in which case the control unit (A) is designed and programmed in such a way that the external computer equipment has free and transparent access to attached and contained units, such as printer, scanner and telephone line, whenever those uni are not occupied by some other process.
2. Information Router as described in patent claim 1 , distinguished by th fact that the control unit (A), with the help from the attached units and built-in fax- and datamodem (3), can convert and route information in such a way that one or several documents can be scanned and, via conversion to fax format, be sent via the telephone network to a remot fax, including all necessary connection establish- and breakup routine
3. Information Router as described in any preceding patent claim, distinguished A the fact that the control unit (A) with the help from th attached units and a built-in fax- and datamodem (3), can convert and route information in forms of fax documents, sent from a remote fax vi the telephone network, in such a way that these fax documents are printed on the attached printer.
4. Information Router as described in any preceding patent claim, distinguished by the fact that the control unit (A), with the help from t built-in fax- and datamodem (3), can convert and route information in such a way that electronic documents that are being sent from an attached computer equipment are converted to fax format and sent via the telephone network to a remote fax, including all necessary connection establish- and breakup routines. 


5. Information Router as described in any preceding patent claim, distinguished by the fact that the control unit (A), with the help from the built-in fax- and datamodem (3), can convert and route information in forms of fax documents, sent from a remote fax via the telephone network, in such a way that these fax documents are routed to the attached computer equipment.
6. Information Router as described in any preceding patent claim, distinguished by the fact that the control unit (A), with the help from the built-in fax- and datamodem (3), can establish contact and route information between the attached computer equipment and a remote computer equipment via the telephone network.
7. Information Router as described in any preceding patent claim, distinguished by the fact that the control unit (A), after having answered an incoming call, can detect whether the caller is a fax machine, a computer modem or a human being and connect the call to the right equipment.
8. Information Router as described in any preceding patent claim, distinguished A the fact that the control unit (A), being attached to more than one telephone lines, can work as a telephone switch in such a way that two calls always can be made: One voice call and one data call (fax- or data format).
9. Information Router as described in any preceding patent claim, distinguished by the fact that the control unit (A), being attached to more than one computer, can work as a printout switch in such a way that the computers are connected to the printer in the same order as they need to access a printer for printout.
10. Information Router as described in any preceding patent claim, distinguished by the fact that the control unit (A), being attached to more than one printer, can work as a printer switch in such a way that the computer is connected to printer that is indicated as the active printer for that computer. The active printer for each computer is set with control codes from the computer or by using the control panel.
