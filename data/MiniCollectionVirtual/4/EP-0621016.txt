<ABSTRACT>
A graft assembly 10 for securely positioning a 
graft at a predetermined location across an abdominal 

aortic aneurysm. The assembly includes a resilient 
self expanding anchor 30 that is secured to the 

distal end of a mesh graft 20. The anchor is formed 
from a single wire having a series of zigzag bends, 

such that when the ends of the wire are attached a 
tubular anchor is produced. The anchor is further 

characterized by curved segments between the bends 
which create an anchor having a reverse barrel shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to devices
for placing and securing a vascular graft in a
predetermined location in a patient's vascular
system.It has been long accepted practice to treat a
variety of vascular disorders in a surgical
procedure that involves placement of a vascular
graft in a patient's vascular system. The
construction and characteristic of the graft
typically will be adapted to optimize its use in the
specific surgical environment and condition to be
treated and, accordingly, a number of different
types of grafts are available. Among the most
common types of vascular grafts are those formed
from a woven or knitted tubular fabric as well as
non-fabric tubes such as expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. 
Such grafts typically are placed in a
patient's vascular system in a highly invasive
surgical procedure. In general, the complexity of
the surgical procedure required to place the graft
will depend on many factors, including the location
and surgical accessibility of the portion of the
patient's vasculature where the graft is to be
placed.Not all vascular conditions in which it would be
desirable to place a graft can be so treated. Among
the particularly troublesome medical conditions in
which it is desirable to place a graft is that of an
abdominal aortic aneurysm, in which a portion of the
patient's aorta, the major artery carrying blood
from the heart, has developed a weakened wall such
that the weakened portion will tend to expand under
the influence of the patient's blood pressure. An
aortic aneurysm presents a life threatening risk
that the aneurysm may burst causing massive internal
bleeding. Treatment of the condition typically has
involved deeply invasive abdominal surgery in which
the patient's abdominal cavity is opened to reach
and expose the aortic aneurysm. While maintaining
the patient on an independent life support system,
the region of the aneurysm is incised lengthwise to
enable insertion of the graft into the aorta to span
the weakened region and define a structurally round
flow path between the remaining healthy portions of 
the aorta. The graft so positioned then is sutured
in place. The graft thus serves as a reinforcing
liner for the weakened portion of the aorta. Such
surgical procedures have been characterized by a
relatively high mortality rate. Typically, patients
suffering from the condition are elderly and are
less able to survive the rigors of major abdominal
surgery. Additionally, there is a substantial
degree of risk when the abdominal cavity is opened
because the

<CLAIMS>
A repair assembly (10) for inhibiting migration of the assembly once it is
positioned within a blood vessel, comprising:


a graft (20) having a proximal end and a distal end;
a self expanding anchor (30) defining a three dimensional generally tubular
shape and secured to said distal end of said graft;

the assembly being characterised in that:
said anchor (30) includes curved anchor segments (34) that extend from a
proximal end of said anchor to a distal end of said anchor and are oriented such

that the diameter of said anchor varies along the longitudinal axis of the anchor,
thereby to define a configuration in which the mid-portion of the generally tubular

anchor constitutes a waist portion which is smaller in diameter than the distal and
proximal ends thereof.
A repair assembly according to claim 1, wherein said anchor (30) comprises a single,
continuous segment of wire.
A repair assembly according to claim 2, wherein said wire includes a series of
bends.
A repair assembly according to claim 3, wherein said wire has first and second
ends that are joined together.
A repair assembly according to claims 2, 3 or 4, wherein said wire is metal.
A repair assembly according to any one of the preceding claims wherein at least
one hook (40) is secured adjacent said distal end of said anchor (30).
A repair assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein said distal
end of said graft (20) is secured to said anchor (30) adjacent said proximal end of said

anchor. 
A repair assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the
anchor waist portion defines an hourglass shape.
An abdominal aortic aneurysm repair device comprising:

a cylindrical graft (20) that is adapted to be positioned within a blood vessel
to encourage tissue ingrowth, wherein said graft (20) includes a proximal end and a

distal end;
a self-expanding anchor (30) defining a three dimensional generally tubular
shape and secured to said distal end of said graft (20) to inhibit migration of said

graft once it is properly positioned within a blood vessel;
wherein said anchor (30) further includes a proximal end and a distal end,
and said distal end of said graft is secured to said anchor adjacent said proximal

end of said anchor;
wherein said anchor (30) includes a single, continuous segment of metal
wire having a series of zigzag bends, said wire including a first end and a second

end, wherein said first and second ends are joined together to form a three-dimensional
structure having a generally tubular shape with a longitudinal axis,

said anchor (30) also including at least one hook (40) secured adjacent said distal
end of said anchor;

characterised in that:
said anchor further includes curved wire segments (34) formed between said
bends, wherein said wire segments are oriented such that the diameter of said

anchor varies along said longitudinal axis thereby to define a configuration in
which the mid-portion of the generally tubular anchor constitutes a waist portion

which is smaller in diameter than the distal end portions thereof.
