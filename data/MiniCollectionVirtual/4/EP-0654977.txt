<ABSTRACT>
A generally cylindrical trocar, for forming a hole in the abdominal wall of a patient to receive a cannula, comprises: cutting means (6); support means (10, 14) for the cutting means, a guard (24) mounted on the support means for axial movement between a forward position in which the guard covers the cutting means and a retracted position in which the cutting means are exposed, and a spring (42) acting between the support means and the guard to bias the guard towards its forward position. The cutting means is provided by two generally triangular blades (2, 4) forming a cruciform blade arrangement with cutting edges (3) inclined to the axis of the trocar.

<DESCRIPTION>
A TROCARThe present invention relates to a trocar. A trocar is a medical cutting tool used in Laparoscopy. In Laparoscopy a hollow tube or cannula is inserted through the wall of the abdominal cavity of a patient to allow surgical tools to be used within the abdominal cavity. The tools are inserted and withdrawn through the cannula. Any surplus tissue or organ can be withdrawn from the cavity through the cannula. One or more cannulas can be inserted through the abdominal wall according to requirements.In order to penetrate the abdominal wall, the wall must first be cut and this is accomplished with a trocar. A known trocar is in the form of an elongate shaft supporting at its free end, a head of circular cross-section, which is profiled at its free end portion to form a solid three sided pyramid defining three cutting edges leading away from the tip. The shaft and head are encased in a retractable guard of plastics material. The guard can be displaced longitudinally of the shaft to expose the head but is spring biased so as to envelop the head once any displacement force is removed.In operation the trocar is inserted into the cannula until its free end projects from the forward end. The cannula and trocar are then urged against the abdominal wall. The resistance of the wall acts to displace the guard and so exposes the cutting edges. The head pierces and cuts the abdominal wall until it emerges from the other side of the wall whereupon, with the resistance of the wall removed, the guard is resiliently displaced to once again cover the head so that the head is prevented from damaging any organs within the abdominal cavity. Continued penetration will allow the cannula to enter the abdominal cavity. It is an object of the present invention to provide a trocar with improved safety wherein the guard cannot normally be retracted to expose the cutting means and can only be so retracted after rotation of the handle 

of the trocar .According to the present invention there is provided a generally cylindrical trocar, for forming a hole in the abdominal wall of a patient to receive a cannula, comprising: cutting means; support means for the cutting means; a guard mounted on the support means for axial movement between a forward position in which the guard covers the cutting means and a retracted position in which the cutting means are exposed; and spring means acting between the support means and the guard to bias the guard towards its forward position; wherein stop means are provided on the support means and the

CLAIMS
1. A generally cylindrical trocar, for forming a hole in the abdominal wall of a patient to receive a cannula, comprising: cutting means; support means for the cutting means; a guard mounted on the support means for axial movement between
"
a forward position in which the guard covers the cutting means and a retracted position i which the cutting means are exposed; and spring means acting between the support means and the guard to bias the guard towards its forward position; wherein stop means are provided on the support means and the guard to prevent movement of the guard from its forward position in a first rotary orientation of the guard relative to the support means but to allow movement of the guard from its forward position in a second rotary orientation of the guard relative to the support means, and wherein the spring means acting between the support means and the guard acts to bias the guard and support means into the first relative rotary orientation. 2. A trocar as claimed in Claim 1, wherein indicator means are provided to indicate whether or not the guard is forward and the guard and support means are in the first relative rotary orientation. 3. A trocar as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the support means comprises an elongate rod and a connector, one end of the elongate rod receiving the cutting means, the other end of the elongate rod being received by the connector and being engaged in use by a handle of the trocar. 4. A trocar as in any preceding claim, wherein the cutting means comprises a plurality of laminar blades lying in angularly spaced radial planes and having cuttin edges inclined to the axis of the trocar and extending rearwardly and radially outwardly from a common point on the axis of the trocar.
5. A trocar as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the guard comprises a generally cylindrical body formed with an axial bore and radial slots within which the blades are 


located; the guard having a maximum diameter substantiall equal to the maximum width of the cutting means.
6. A trocar as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the leading end of the guard is recessed between each slot so that it has a profile similar to the profile of the cutting means.
7. A trocar as claimed in any one of Claims 4 to 6, wherein the cutting means comprises two generally triangular laminar blades locked together in a cruciform configuration and extending at right angles to each other and sharing a common apex and a common mid-point of the base.
8. A trocar as claimed in Claim 7, wherein one said triangular blade has a slot extending from the apex towards the base and the other said triangular blade has a slot extending from the base towards the apex so that the blades can be fitted together in a cruciform arrangement.
9. A trocar as claimed in Claim 5 or Claim 6, wherein the cutting means comprises two generally triangular blades, each blade being bent through a right angle about a line extending from the apex to the base, the blades being positioned so that one half of each of said blades is generally aligned with a first plane and the other half of each blade is generally aligned with a second plane extending at right angles to the first plane.
10. A trocar substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
