<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for 
collecting goods. Fig. 11 illustrates a prior art method of collecting goods. This prior 
art method of collecting goods uses goods drop-out units, each of which can 
accommodate goods of one kind and dropout a given quantity of goods. A 
plurality of such goods drop-out units, which are prepared for respective different 
kinds of goods, are arranged along a goods collection path of a conveyor such that 
goods dropped out from the individual goods drop-out units are collected in goods 
receptacles provided in the conveyor. In the Fig. 11, designated at 1A, 1B ... are 
goods drop-out units, at 2 is a conveyor, and at 2A, 2B ... are goods receptacles. In the above prior art, however, there are at least three major 
problems. Since the conveyor 2 is fed continuously at all times, the goods 
drop-out units 1A, 1B, ... have to stop the drop-out of goods at a precise timing, 
at which the borderline between adjacent goods receptacles of the conveyor 2 
proceeds past their front. (In the example illustrated in Fig. 11, goods drop-out 
units 1D and 1H are at the goods drop-out stop timing.) Therefore, there is 
difficulty in goods drop-out timing control. Since the conveyor 2 is fed continuously at all times, goods can be 
dropped out from the goods drop-out units 1A, 1B, ... only during a period, during 
which the goods receptacles 2A, 2B, ... of the conveyor 2 are proceeding past the 
front of the goods drop-out units 1A, 1B, .... This means that there is a limit  
 
imposed on the maximum quantity of drop-out from the goods drop-out units 1A, 
1B, .... The goods receptacles 2A, 2B, ... of the conveyor 2 are hard and 
planar, have small goods reception capacity and are long such as to correspond to 
the spaces of a plurality of goods drop-out units. Therefore, if one or more goods 
receptacles are to be assigned to one container, a long conveyor length is necessary 
for one container. This means that with a fixed conveyor speed a long time is 
necessary for the collection of goods for one container. It is an object of the invention is to facilitate the goods drop-out 
timing control when collecting goods, to permit increasing the drop-out quantity 
of goods from the goods drop-out units and to increase the goods collection speed. According to the invention, there is provided a method of collecting 
goods 
using goods drop-out units each for accommodating goods of a 
single kind and capable of dropping out a given quantity of goods comprising:

A method of collecting goods 
using goods drop-out units each for accommodating goods of a 

single kind and capable of dropping out a given quantity of goods comprising: 

arranging a plurality of goods drop-out units prepared for respective 
different kinds of goods along a goods collection path of a conveyor; and 
collecting goods dropped out from each goods drop-out unit in a 
goods receptacle provided in the conveyor which has flexible U-shaped 

goods 
receptacles each provided in correspondence to the opening of each goods drop-out 

unit; 
each goods receptacle being successively brought to the position of 
the openings of each goods drop-out unit with intermittent feeding of the conveyor 

such as to bring each goods receptacle of the conveyor to the positions of the 
openings of each goods drop-out unit at a time; 
the goods dropped out from each goods drop-out unit being 
successively collected in each goods receptacle, 

thereby collecting the plurality of different 
kinds of goods in the respective goods receptacles. 
An apparatus for collecting goods comprising a plurality of 
goods drop-out units (14) each for accommodating goods of a single kind and capable 

of dropping out a given quantity of goods, a conveyor (17), the goods drop-out 
units being 

prepared for respective different kinds of goods and being arranged along a goods 
collection path of the conveyor, and a controller for controlling the goods drop-out 

units and the conveyor such that goods dropped out from the goods drop-out 
units 

are collected in goods receptacles provided in the conveyor; 

the conveyor having flexible U-shaped goods receptacles (62) each 
provided in correspondence to the opening of each goods drop-out unit;  

 
the controller successively bringing each goods receptacle to the 
position of the openings of each goods drop-out unit by intermittently feeding the 

conveyor such as to bring the goods receptacles of the conveyor to the positions of 
the openings of the goods drop-out units at a time and collecting the goods 

dropped out from each goods drop-out unit successively in each goods receptacle, 
thereby collecting the plurality of different kinds of goods in the respective goods 

receptacles. 
The apparatus for collecting goods according to claim 2, 
wherein the conveyor has a plurality of flexible goods receptacle members 

supported by an endless circulated support member at a plurality of positions 
thereof in the feeding direction, each goods receptacle member being suspended 

between an upstream and a downstream support point in a flexible U-shaped 
form 

to form a goods receptacle; and
 
   means for changing the distance between the upstream and 

downstream support points of each goods receptacle. 
The apparatus for collecting goods according to claim 2, which 
further comprises a stationary chute (16) extending forward from a position beneath the 

drop-out opening of the goods drop-out unit to the conveyor and a guide chute (15) 
extending from the edge of the drop-out opening of the goods drop-out 

unit over 
the stationary chute. 
The apparatus for collecting goods according to claim 4, 
wherein the goods drop-out unit has an opening and closing member (27) for 

successively opening the drop-out openings, the guide chute having an upper end 
secured to the opening and closing member of the goods drop-out unit.
