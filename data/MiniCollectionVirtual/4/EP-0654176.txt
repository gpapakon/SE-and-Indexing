<ABSTRACT>
The device of the invention consists of an essentially T-shaped cooler (2) divided into a web (14) and a cross-plate (16), which is secured to a printed circuit board (PCB) (1) by screws (9). The base plate (6) of a spring unit (15) is inserted between the web (14) of the cooler (2) and the PCB (1) having at least one spring tab (7) on either side. The web (14) has threaded holes (11) mating with holes in the base plate (6). For accurate positioning of the base plate (6), said holes have an angled tab (12) at each end which fits into a corresponding hole in the PCB (1). The semiconductors (3, 4) to be secured, which are soldered to electric terminals (5), are pressed against the surface of the cross-plate (16) facing the PCB by the spring tabs. Depending on the potential of the semiconductors (3, 4) or the design of their housing, an insulating plate (8) is inserted between the semiconductors (3, 4) and the cross-plate (16).
