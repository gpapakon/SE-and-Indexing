<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of p-hydroxystyrene polymers by free-radical polymerisation of p-hydroxystyrene, whose phenolic hydroxyl group is protected by an acid-cleavable group, or of mixtures of p-hydroxystyrene protected in this manner with other polymerisable ethylenically unsaturated organic compounds to a polymerisation conversion of more than 95% and subsequent treatment of the polymer with an acid, wherein the polymer is treated with a reducing agent during or after the acid treatment. The p-hydroxystyrene polymers prepared in accordance with the invention are suitable for deep-UV lithography.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a p-hydroxystyrene 
polymer by free radical polymerization of 

p-hydroxystyrene, whose phenolic hydroxyl group is protected 
by an acid-cleavable group, or of a mixture of 

p-hydroxystyrene protected in this manner with other 
polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated organic compounds 

to a polymerization conversion of more than 95% and 
subsequent treatment of the polymer with an acid, wherein 

the polymer is treated with a phosphorus-containing 
reducing agent during or after the acid treatment. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
phosphorus-containing reducing agent has a reduction 

potential of 
<
 -0.3 V against a standard hydrogen electrode. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
phosphorus-containing reducing agent used is phosphorous 

or hypophosphorous acid or a derivative of one of these 
acids. 
A process as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, wherein, in the mixture of the protected 

p-hydroxystyrene with other polymerizable ethylenically 
unsaturated organic compounds, the said organic compounds 

used are those which have little or no absorbance in the 
wavelength range from 240 to 280 nm. 
A process as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, wherein 


(a) a hydroxystyrene protected by a group which can be 
eliminated under acid catalysis, if required as a 

mixture with further monomers, is polymerized in the 
presence of a solvent and of an aliphatic peroxide  

 
initiator and 
(b) the acid-labile protective group is eliminated in 
the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid and of 

a phosphorus-containing reducing agent and, if 
required, of an alcohol. 
A process as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the protected hydroxystyrene used is 

trimethylsilyloxystyrene, p-acetoxystyrene, tert-butoxystyrene 
and/or tetrahydropyranyloxystyrene. 
A process as claimed in any of the preceding 
claims, wherein the comonomers used as further monomers 

are selected from the group consisting of 3-methyl-4-acetoxystyrene, 
3,5-dimethyl-4-acetoxystyrene, acrylic 

acid, methacrylic acid, acrylates, methacrylates and 
styrene. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the 
solvent used is an alcohol, such as methanol, ethanol, 

propanol or isopropanol. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the 
aliphatic peroxide initiator used is tert-butyl 

perpivalate.
