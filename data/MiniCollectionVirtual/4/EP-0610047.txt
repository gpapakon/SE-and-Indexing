<ABSTRACT>
A seat assembly (10) for use in washing the anal or genital area of a person in a 
bath (34) while the person is seated on the seat assembly (10). The seat assembly 

(10) comprises a seat (12) having an aperture (14) in it and an engagement 
formation (16) in the form of a downwardly extending lip (21) for engaging a wall 

(36) of the bath (34), and a support means in the form of two legs (18) depending 
from the seat (12). Each leg (18) comprises an upper tubular member (43) and a 

lower tubular member (45) which are telescopically displaceable with respect to one 
another via a threaded bar inside the tubular members for adjusting the length of the 

leg (18). The seat assembly (10) includes a holding clip (62.2) for holding of a 
shower head in an arrangement in which a stream of water can be directed towards 

the anal or genital area of a person seated on the seat (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a seat assembly for a bath and has particular 
application for enabling the utilisation of a hand held shower head as a bidet. In certain medical conditions, for example haemorrhoids or other conditions 
causing itching of the anal or genital area of a person, discomfort can be 
relieved by the use of a bidet for application of cool water to the affected area. 
Where there is no bidet installed, this treatment must be effected in a shower 
or bath. Whilst taking a bath will relieve the discomfort, it is more convenient 
to use a hand held shower head to wash the affected area. The utilisation of 
such a shower head in this treatment will often entail the person having to 
crouch, which when being effected in a bath could result in the person 
sustaining injury from slipping. Where the person is elderly, infirm, or perhaps 
suffering from rheumatism or arthritis, the dangers of effecting such a treatment 
unaided, are increased. Any reference hereinafter to an affected area of a person must be interpreted 
to mean the anal or genital area of the person.  It is an object of this invention to provide a seat assembly to minimise the 
aforementioned dangers. In accordance with the invention, there is provided a seat assembly for use in 
washing an affected area of a person in a bath, comprising a seat having an 
aperture therein, the seat having an engagement formation along one edge 
thereof for engaging a wall of the bath, and having support means depending 
therefrom adjacent another edge of the seat which is opposed to said one edge 
of the seat. The engagement formation may include an operatively downwardly extending 
lip which can operatively engage a portion of the bath at the operative top end 
of the wall of the bath in an arrangement in which lateral displacement of the 
seat assembly with respect to the bath, in a direction towards said another edge 
of the seat, is restricted. The support means may comprise two legs disposed in spaced relationship to 
one another and depending from a portion of the seat adjacent said another 
edge thereof. Each of the legs may comprise two leg portions which are telescopically 
displaceable with respect to one another, thereby permitting adjustment of the 
length of the legs. Each leg may include a screw arrangement which permits the leg portions of 
each leg to be screwed with respect to one another for adjusting the length of 
the leg.  The seat may have a horseshoe-like configuration in plan view, with the 
aperture of the seat

edge of the seat. 
A seat assembly as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the 
engagement formation includes an operatively downwardly extending lip 

which can operatively engage a portion of the bath at the operative top 
end of the wall of the bath in an arrangement in which lateral 

displacement of the seat assembly with respect to the bath, in a direction 
towards said another edge of the seat, is restricted. 
A seat assembly as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized in that 
the support means comprises two legs disposed in spaced relationship to 

one another and depending from a portion of the seat adjacent said 
another edge thereof. 
A seat assembly as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that each of the 
legs comprises two leg portions which are telescopically displaceable with 

respect to one another, thereby permitting adjustment of the length of 
the legs. 
A seat assembly as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that each leg 
includes a screw arrangement which permits the leg portions of each leg 

to be screwed with respect to one another for adjusting the length of the 
leg.

characterized in that the seat has a horseshoe-like configuration in plan 

view, with the aperture of the seat opening out along said another edge 
between the legs. 
A seat assembly as claimed in any one of Claims 3 to 6, characterized in 
that each leg includes a foot member which is connected thereto and 

which is pivotally displaceable with respect to the leg to permit secure 
location of the leg on surfaces which are obliquely disposed with respect 

to the leg. 
A seat assembly as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the seat assembly includes holding means for 

operatively holding a shower head in a position which permits a stream 
of water to be directed via the shower head towards the affected area of
