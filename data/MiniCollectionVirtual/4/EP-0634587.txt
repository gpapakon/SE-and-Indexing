<ABSTRACT>
A gas cylinder with a valve plug made of two 
parts (4,5), which are fitted together by pressure. 

Of the two parts, the lower one (5) has an outer 
slot (7) with three sharp angles in it, which communicates 

the inter-cylinder space with the gas intake 
valve upwards of the piston. The intake valve shaft 

finishes at its lower end in a washer, which has a 
upper ring-shaped rabbet or offset. With this cylinder, 

the rate of flow of the gas is regulated and a 
greater safety margin is obtained in its operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas cylinders of the 
type normally used to regulate seats. These cylinders 
are composed of two concentric tubes, of which the 
inner one is occupied by a piston operated by a ram or 
plunger. The space between the tubes is occupied by a 
gas and this gas travels from the interior of the inner 
cylinder to both sides of the piston, through gas 
passages or holes cut in a valve plug and in a shaft 
plug. A gas cylinder of this type is described in 
Patent Application ES.9001140 (FR-A-2 661 229), which presents the valve 
plug and the shaft plug based on three parts which are 
assembled together. The valve plug formed, by means of 
two of its components, the passage for the gas between 
the inter-tube chamber and the piston, through the valve 
shaft, which means that it was not necessary to make 
any kind of holes to provide this necessary passage. However, for certain applications, it was necessary 
to have a greater possibility of regulating the 
speed of circulation of the gas so that its behaviour 
was in tune with the falling and rising of the piston. 
To this effect, the cylinder presented there is limited 
to achieving only low speeds. Moreover, in that cylinder, the valve plug was 
composed of three components assembled together, which 
meant that there was the risk, on some occasions, of 
these parts working loose and making the cylinder unusable. Another disadvantage of the said cylinder was 
in the fact that during the assembly and once it had  
 
been completed, the cylinder might remain pressed down 
and consequently the passage of gas through the valve 
shaft gasket would remain open. One object of the invention is to provide a gas 
cylinder with a valve plug consisting of only two parts 
fitted together by pressure, between which a passage 
for gas is formed, communicating the inter-cylinder 
space with the valve shaft, with the gas passage being 
in a broken line with at least three angles of 90ยบ each. A second object of the invention is the provision 
of a circular or ring-shaped rabbet on the upper 
end of the lower stop of the valve shaft, where the 
O-ring gasket is fitted. A third object of the invention is the forming of 
lugs on one of the two components that make up the valve 
plug. A final object of the invention is the provision 
of a double slot in one of the components that make up 
the valve plug. The invention provides a gas cylinder according to the features of claim 1. To put these objectives into practice, a valve 
plug is made, consisting of two

<CLAIMS>
Gas cylinder, of the type which have two concentric 
cylinders (A, B) with a space between them (C), 

with a piston (8') in the interior or chamber of the 
inner cylinder, separating the chamber into two sections, 

with the internal space being occupied by a gas which 
travels in the said interior towards the two chambers 

formed by the piston, through the respectively arranged 
passages in a valve plug (5) and in a shaft plug (14), 

with the valve plug, consisting of two parts, and the 
shaft plug, consisting of three parts, assembled together 

by pressure, between which is situated the upper 
gas passage towards the flow or by-pass valve, with 

this being a vertical shaft finishing in a ring-shaped 
ledge or projection that takes in an O-ring gasket, 

which is characterized in that the valve plug (5) consists 
of two cylindrical parts (4, 5) assembled together 

by pressure, an upper one (4) that receives a protector 
(3) on its top, and a lower one (5) that is housed inside 

the former by means of a neck (16), in that the lower 
one (5) has, in the portion that adjusts to the outer 

tube and in the portion in contact with the upper part, 
a channel or slot (7) with at least three 90
ยบ
 angles, 
cut according to a vertical radial plane and arriving, 

by means of an upper straight section of the said slot, 
at the hollow centre through which the valve shaft (6) 

travels, with a washer (24) that finishes off the 
lower end of the said valve shaft (6) having a ring-shaped 

rabbet (27) cut in the outer edge of its upper surface, 
with this rabbet being situated in a lower plane  

 
than that corresponding to the seating area of the 

O-ring gasket. 
Gas cylinder, in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized in that the lower part (5) of the two 

that make up the valve plug is provided with a set of 
lugs or protuberances (22) on the surface on which it 

is housed in the interior of the outer cylinder. 
Gas cylinder, in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized in that the lower part of the two that 

make up the valve plug is provided with two ring-shaped 
recesses that each receive O-ring gaskets, cut into 

the surface of the part that is housed inside the tube.
