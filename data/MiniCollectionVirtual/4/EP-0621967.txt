<ABSTRACT>
A multi-processor computer system is described that consists of at least two processors equipped with storage means. Each of the processors is assigned at least one private storage area (10) in the storage means. Furthermore, at least one common storage area (16) is provided in the sotrage means, to which a portion (13) of the private storage area (10) is assigned. Through this storage means arrangement, it is possible, using appropriate commands, to transfer messages between different processors via common storage areas. The management of the private and common storage areas is accomplished using tables, whereby the use of help tables simplifies locating information required for carrying out specific commands.

<DESCRIPTION>
 D E S C R I P T I O NMULTI-PROCESSOR COMPUTER SYSTEMThe invention relates to a computer system with at least two processors equipped with storage means, whereby each of the processors is assigned at least one private storage area in the storage means. The invention further relates to a method employed in such a computer system for assigning a portion of a private storage area to a common storage area.Multi-processor computer systems of the stated type have been disclosed. Likewise, various possible approaches have been disclosed for managing storage means by multi-proces- sor computer systems. The type of such management is usu¬ ally dependent on the specific application. If the storage means, for example, are to be used to transfer messages be¬ tween the individual processors of the multi-processor com¬ puter system, management of the storage means in this case differs from the case in which a common storage area as¬ signed to multiple processors is locked and unlocked to en¬ sure defined access sequences. The management of the stor¬ age means by multi-processor computer systems is therefore application-related and thus inflexible.The object of the invention is to create a multi-processor computer system, and a corresponding method, which allows management of the storage means adaptable in a simple man¬ ner to different applications and requirements.This objective is substantially fulfilled by the invention in that, for a computer system as originally described, at least one common storage area is provided in the storage means, to which a portion of at least one of the private storage areas is assigned. In a method as originally de¬ scribed, the objective is substantially fulfilled in that, depending on the common storage area, a pointer is read 

from a table of the common storage areas which references a table of the assigned portions of the private storage areas and that, depending on the pointer, the portion of the pri¬ vate storage area assigned to the common storage area is read from the table of the assigned portions of the private storage areas.The common storage area can be laid out depending on the specific application. Also, the number of assigned private storage areas, as well as the layout of these private stor¬ age areas, is flexible. The invention thus enables flexible management of the storage means of a multi-processor com¬ puter system.In particular, this is accomplished using the table of the common storage areas and the table of the assigned portions of the private storage areas.
