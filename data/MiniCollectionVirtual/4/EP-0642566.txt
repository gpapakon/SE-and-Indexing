<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the fluid catalytic 
cracking (FCC) of petroleum feedstocks to produce 
transportation fuels and is especially directed to 
improvements in FCC to increase the isobutylene and 
isoamylenes contents of the cracked product. Increased addition of oxygenated materials to 
gasoline has been mandated by the US Government. The 
current industry additives of choice are methyl tertiary 
butyl ether (MTBE) and tertiary amyl methyl ether 
(TAME) . The technology to make MTBE is well known and 
commercially viable. Briefly, the ether is manufactured 
by reacting isobutylene and methanol over a resin 
catalyst. Obtaining sufficient amounts of isobutylene 
and isoamylenes at reasonable cost is crucial. In most 
modern refineries, a dehydroisomerization process can be 
operated to convert butanes to isobutylene. However, a 
fluid catalytic cracker is the best if not the only 
source of making isobutylene and isoamylenes while 
processing heavy hydrocarbon streams such as gas oil and 
resid. An FCC catalyst that enhances these olefin 
yields is essential for viable production of MTBE and 
TAME in refineries. It is well known in the literature that lowering 
the unit cell size (UCS) of a Y zeolite via steaming 
gives a catalyst which enhances olefin selectivity 
during the catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons. We have 
discovered, however, that we can make further 
improvements in isobutylene and isoamylene yields other than 
by just lowering unit cell size of Y.  
 WO 86/03139 discloses cracking catalysts containing non-zeolite 
molecular sieves and optionally high UCS zeolites 
(under 30 wt.%); the catalysts are alleged to give product 
of increased broached/straight chain olefins, but gives data 
for only C₆ and higher olefins and products other than isobutylene 
and isoamylene, for whose production and recovery 
there is no data or teaching. US-A-5001091 and EP-A-0256875 
propose high UCS zeolite/low alumina cracking catalysts with 
no data or teaching concerning the production and recovery 
of branched C₄ and C₅ olefins. The present invention comprises an FCC operation 
wherein the catalyst is a composite comprising (a) non-zeolitic 
alumina-silica (e.g. mixtures of Al₂O₃, SiO₂, and 
SiO₂-Al₂O₃ component of at least 45% Al₂O₃ and (b) 
≤ 30% Y zeolite with a unit cell size ≤ 24.29 Å, the 
matrix of said catalyst having a BET surface area > 50 
m²/g, said composite catalyst having a Lewis/Bronsted 
acid site ratio of > 1.5, and preferably greater than 
2.5, wherein the total number of Bronsted
