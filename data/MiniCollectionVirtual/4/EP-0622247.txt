<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a film for high heat-sensitive 
stencil paper and, particularly, to a film for 
high heat-sensitive stencil paper which has an excellent 
perforation sensitivity and an excellent printing quality, 
i.e., resolution and density of a printed image. As heat-sensitive stencil paper, a laminate of a 
thermoplastic resin film such as polyester film and thin 
porous paper is conventionally known. The film used for 
this purpose is required to have a high thermal perforation 
sensitivity. In other words, the film is required to melt 
with a small quantity of heat and to have an adequate heat 
shrinkage ratio which enables openings of an appropriate 
size for producing a clear printed image to be formed. As a material of a film used for such a purpose, a 
mixture of polyesters is known (e.g., Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 3-39294 (1991)). In the 
film material, polymers are mixed so as to lower the 
melting point and to enable perforation with a small 
quantity of heat. However, since the melting temperatures 
are different between the mixed polyesters, uniform 
perforation is not always possible. A copolymerized polymer may be used as a material of 
this type of film. In most case, however, the 
crystallinity is lowered due to copolymerization, and when 
the film is industrially produced from such a copolymer,  
 
fusion is caused while the resin is heated and dried, so 
that melt extrusion by a screw extruder is impossible. As a result of various studies undertaken by the 
present inventors so as to solve the above-described 
problems, it has been found that a biaxially oriented film 
which is formed from at least two polyesters and has a 
specified thickness and melting point is suitable for heat-sensitive 
stencil paper. On the basis of this finding, the 
present invention has been achieved. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
film for heat-sensitive stencil paper having a good 
handling property and an excellent perforation property, 
and showing a high resolution and an excellent printing 
quality when printing is conducted by using a stencil paper 
produced from the film. To accomplish the aims, in an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a film for heat-sensitive 
stencil paper comprising a biaxially oriented film having a 
thickness of 0.5 to 6.0 µm and formed from a polyester 
composition comprising polybutylene terephthalate and other 
polyester,
 
   a ratio of the polybutylene terephthalate in the whole 
polyesters
