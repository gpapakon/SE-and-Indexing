<ABSTRACT>
An image synthesizing apparatus includes a 
reading unit for reading an image of an original, an 

input unit for inputting print data from the outside, 
a first setting unit for setting a synthesis mode for 

synthesizing image data output from the reading unit 
and the print data input from the input unit to record, 

a second setting unit for setting a number of pages of 
the print data to
 be synthesized in the synthesis mode 
and a control unit adapted, then the synthesis mode is 

set by the first setting unit, to maintain the 
synthesis mode until the print data of the number of 

pages set by the second setting unit is input by the 
input unit, and to cancel the synthesis mode after the 

print data of the set number of pages has input.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
synthesizing method in an image processing apparatus, for synthesizing an original
image and an externally entered image.There has conventionally been proposed a
multifunctional image processing apparatus consisting
of a digital copying apparatus equipped with a scanner
unit and a printer unit and of an external device such
as a computer.Such apparatus is provided with a memory for
storing image data, for the purpose of synthesizing an
original image with an externally entered (input) image,
and the image synthesis is conducted in such memory.However, when the image synthesizing mode is
selected, there result various inconveniences unless
the conditions for releasing (cancelling) the image
synthesizing mode are suitably selected.For example, in case of synthesizing an image
read from the scanner with an image and a character
released (output) from the computer, the image scanned
in the scanner is exclusively used for synthesis with
the image from the computer while the image synthesizing
mode is selected. Consequently the scanner unit cannot 
be utilized for other functions such as copying or
facsimile transmission but is entirely occupied by the
specified function, so that the utilization of the
apparatus for other functions is limited.For releasing the scanner unit from the occupied
state for image synthesis, the operator is required to
intentionally effect a cancelling operation for said
image synthesis mode, so that the burden for the
operator becomes larger. Prior art document US-A-4 884 104 discloses a copy
apparatus having an overlay mode for synthesis-recording an
original image and data from an external device, with the
overlay mode being changed to a normal mode when a start
instruction is not input for a predetermined time in the
overlay mode. However, this "timeout" feature according to
this known prior art is effective only before a copying
operation starts. That is, the overlay mode is not released
till the copying operation completes after the copy
operation starts.Therefore, the arrangement according to US-A-4 884 104
suffers from a drawback that another user cannot use the
image processing apparatus until the copying operation has
finished, thus resulting in time inefficient use of the
apparatus.Consequently, it is an object of the present invention to
provide for an image synthesizing method in an image
processing apparatus, which is free from the above
drawback.This object is achieved by an image synthesizing method in
an image processing
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An image synthesizing method in an image processing
apparatus, comprising the steps of:


a) causing said image processing apparatus to set a
synthesis mode for synthesizing image data output from

reading means and print data from a computer;
b) causing to output image data of an original from
said reading means;
c) causing to output the print data from said
computer;
d) causing said image processing means to synthesize
the image data from said reading means and the print data

from said computer;
characterized by the
 further steps of:

e) causing said image processing apparatus to set the
number of pages of print data from the computer to be

synthesized in said synthesis mode;
f) counting the number of pages of print data;
g) causing said image processing apparatus to release
said synthesis mode when there is no output of the print

data from said computer for a predetermined time after
synthesizing the image data and the print data starts,

before the number of counted pages of print data has
reached the set number of pages of print data in said step

e).
A method according to claim 1, further comprising steps
of causing said image processing apparatus to inhibit using

said reading means except an object of the synthesizing
when said synthesis mode is set; and causing said image  

processing apparatus to allow using said reading means when
said synthesis mode is released.
A method according to claim 1, further comprising a step
of causing said image processing apparatus to release said

synthesis mode when synthesizing the image data and the
print data has been completed as the number of counted

pages of print data reaches the set number of pages of
print data in said step e).
A method according to claim 1, further comprising steps
of causing said image processing apparatus to set a first

processing mode for processing the image data from said
reading means without using data from said computer; and

causing said image processing apparatus to inhibit setting
the first processing mode when executing said synthesis

mode starts and to allow setting the first processing mode
when said synthesis mode is released in said step f).
A method according to claim 4, wherein said first
processing mode includes one of a copy mode and a facsimile

transmitting mode.
