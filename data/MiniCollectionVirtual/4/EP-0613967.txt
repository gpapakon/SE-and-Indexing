<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, the plates (5.1 and 5.2) of a drawing bath S, which are known from European Patent Applications nos. 0,384,836 A1 and 0,468,918 A1, are structured, as shown in Figures 7 to 16a, in such a way as to make it possible to have a thread run which prevents a vibration of the threads during passage through the drawing bath.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for stretching a synthetic yarn 
consisting of a single fibril, preferably of a 

plurality of fibrils, between two guide walls (38, 
39) which are situated in a stretching bath and 

which are situated during the operation at a predefined 
distance (A) from one another in a brake 

liquid of the stretching bath, characterized in 
that on at least one of the walls (38, 39) situated 

opposite of the yarn there is provided a 
structured surface on which the yarn is guided 

over a predefined path in which the walls are 
situated in the brake liquid. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the structured surface is produced by 

means of holes penetrating the plate. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the structured surface is provided in addition 

with recesses into which the holes of the 
perforated plate open out. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the structured surface is additionally 

provided with a lattice stretched over the perforated 
surface. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the structured surface is additionally 

provided with wire windings stretched over the 
perforated surface. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that an intermediate space (40) is provided  

 
between the lattice and the perforated surface. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that the recesses are grooves facing transversally 

to the course of the yarn. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that the recesses are grooves facing in the direction 

of the course of the yarn. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that the recesses are grooves facing in an inclined 

manner to the course of the yarn. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that the recesses are grooves which each face 

transversally to the direction of the course of 
the yarn and in the direction of the course of the 

yarn and that the bores open out into predefined 
points of intersection of the grooves. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that means are provided in order to change the 

said distance (A). 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that means are provided in order to change the 

said predefined path. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 12, characterized 
in that the said means change the stretching bath 

level with plates which are arranged stationarily. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 11, characterized 
in that at least one of the plates is arranged 

positionally adjustable.
