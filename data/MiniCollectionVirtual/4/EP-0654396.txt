<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a floor element (1) with a standing area for livestock, such as cloven-hoofed animals, in particular for livestock transporters (cattle lorries). A surface-profiling in the form of a pattern of profiled strips arranged at an angle to one another is impressed out of the solid-surfaced main plane (10). The profiled strips are designed as adjacent groups (12, 12') of hoof-engaging webs (11) and between the adjacent web groups (12, 12') there are left sluices (13) flush with the main plane (10) of the floor element (1).

A flooring element (1, 1') with a tread area, particularly for livestock such as 
cloven-hoofed animals, in which a surface profiling in the form of profiled strips (11) 

disposed at angles to one another is stamped out of the main plane (10) the surface 
of which is closed, the profiled strips forming a mutually adjacent groups of webs 

(12, 12') between which flushing channels (13) are left which are in line with the 
main plane (10) of the flooring element (1, 1'), each web group (12, 12') being 

formed by an equal number of profiled strips (11), characterised in that each 
complete web group (12, 12') comprises three profiled strips (11) and in that the 

profiled strips (11) in each web group (12, 12') are disposed at right-angles to one 
another in the form of an H-profile. 
A flooring element (1, 1') according to claim 1, characterised in that the web 
groups (12, 12') are disposed in parallel rows. 
A flooring element according to claim 2, characterised in that the web groups (12, 
12') in each row are rotated alternately through 90Â°. 
A flooring element (1, 1') according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the web 
groups (12, 12') in the adjacent parallel rows are staggered in respect of one another. 
A flooring element (1, 1') according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the length (a) of the profiled strips (11) amounts to about 40 to 80 mm and in that their 

width (b) amounts to about 10 to 14 mm. 
A flooring element (1, 1') according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the profiled strips (11) are stamped out of the main plane (10) with a trapezoidal section. 
A flooring element (1, 1') according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 
the middle web (11b) of the H-profile merges at both ends integrally into the adjacent 

outer web (11a) of the H-profile.  
 
A flooring element (1, 1') according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 
the middle web (11b) of the H-profile is sufficiently shortened in its length that between 

its two ends and the adjacent outer web (11a) of the H-profile there is in each case a 
further flushing channel which is aligned with the main plane (10). 
A flooring element (1, 1') according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that 
the width of the flushing channels (13, 14) amounts to about 5 to 25 mm and is preferably 

about 10 to 15 mm. 
A flooring element (1) according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that it 
is constructed from metal as a self-supporting profiled member, particularly as a flat, 

preferably multi-chamber hollow profiled member (2) which has at least on one lateral 
edge (3, 4) a profile construction for a clamping fitment to a like profiled member in order 

to form a composite assembly of profiled members. 
A flooring element (1') according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that it 
is constructed as a solid flooring sheet (15).
