<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method of operating a fluidized bed 
reactor for combusting refuse derived fuel is disclosed. 

The reactor includes a fluidized furnace section 30 and 
stripper/cooler section 80. A downwardly sloping grid 28 

extends across the furnace section 30 and stripper/cooler 
section 80 to a drain 78 in the stripper/cooler section 80, 

and directional nozzles 38 disposed in the grid fluidize the 
beds in the furnace section 30 and stripper/cooler section 

80 and forcibly convey relatively large particulate material 
across the grid 28, through the furnace section 30 and 

stripper/cooler section 80, and to the drain 78 for 
disposal. A refractory layer 36 is provided along the grid 

28 surface to reduce the height of the nozzles 38 within the 
furnace section 30, thereby helping to prevent relatively 

large particulate material from becoming entangled with or 
stuck to the nozzles 38. The furnace section 30 and 

stripper/cooler section 80 are designed to provide a 
relatively straight path for the relatively large 

particulate material passing from the furnace section 30, to 
the stripper/cooler section 80, and to the drain 78.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluidized bed reactor and
method of operating a fluidized bed reactor and, more
particularly, to such a reactor and method in which the
reactor is fueled in whole or in part by refuse derived
fuel, or RDF.Cities across the United States and in other countries
are seeking alternatives to landfills for the disposal of
municipal solid waste, or MSW. Available landfill space is
rapidly decreasing, and costs associated with landfill
disposal continue to increase. As a result, some cities are
turning to incineration as a means of reducing the amount of
MSW which otherwise must be sent to landfills while, at the
same time, recovering energy from the waste. In typical waste-to-energy combustors, solid waste is
burned on the surface of a grate or hearth, or in a shallow
suspension, just above the grate surface. Convective
agitation of the waste is minimal and is typically aided by
mechanical means. Fluidized bed reactors have been proposed
for burning MSW and provide a number of advantages over non-fluidized
waste reactors. For example, the high turbulence,
and therefore intimate mixing of fuel, air, and hot inert
particles in a fluidized bed reactor, can provide for
combustion efficiencies exceeding 99% as compared to
combustion efficiencies of approximately 97% to 98% in non-fluidized
waste combustors. Fluidized bed reactors also
provide greater fuel flexibility and enhanced pollution
control.However, fluidized bed reactors used to date have not
been without problems. For example, to date, fluidized bed
reactors have utilized complex combustion systems which
include a moving or travelling grate furnace. These systems
have many moving parts and typically burn at an elevated
furnace temperature that often results in a high furnace
corrosion rate, frequent equipment failure, and low plant
availability.EP-A-0 595 487 shows a fluidized bed reactor which is
not said to be designed for handling RDF but has a stripper/
cooler section adjacent the furnace section and a sloping
grid through which directional nozzles extend so that
together they urge the material of the fluidized bed to
gravitate from the furnace section to the stripper/cooler
section for cooling before discharge.GB-A-2 032 598 also shows a fluidized bed with a
coder section. It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a fluidized bed reactor and a method of operating a
fluidized bed reactor in which RDF may be cleanly and
efficiently incinerated without the use of complex
combustion systems which include

temporarily discontinued after a desired amount of large

particulate material is contained in the stripper/cooler
section (80), cooling the large particulate material in the

stripper/cooler section (80), draining the cooled large 
particulate material from said stripper/cooler section (80),

comprising passing a mixture of fluidizing gas and entrained

particulate material from the furnace section (30) to a
separator (16), separating the fluidizing gas from the

entrained particulate material, cooling the separated gas to
below 1250°F (approx. 677°C), and passing the cooled gas

across a superheater heat exchange surface (110A, 110B), the
cooling of the gas acting to protect the superheater heat

exchange surface (110A, 110B) from excessive corrosion due
to acid attack which is enhanced at temperatures above

approximately 1250°F (approx 677°C).
