<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetic head arrangement for a magnetic tape apparatus with a rotatably mounted head wheel, which has magnetic heads (10) arranged on the circumference, the laterally arranged additional legs (12) are, according to the invention, drawn up as far as the running area of the magnetic tape (14), so that their end faces (12a) form a common running surface with the end face (11a) of the magnetic head (10).

<CLAIMS>
A magnetic-head device for a magnetic-tape apparatus comprising a
rotatably supported head disc carrying magnetic heads (10) at its periphery, which magnetic

heads each have lateral additional limbs (12) disposed so as to form secondary gaps (13),
characterized in that
 the additional limbs (12) of each magnetic head (13) extend into the
transport path of the magnetic tape (14) and in that the end faces (12a) of the additional

limbs (12) form a common contact face together with the end face (11a) of the magnetic
head (10).
A magnetic-head device as claimed in Claim 1,
characterized in that
 the secondary gaps (13) are dimensioned in such a manner that there is
no appreciable short-circuit of the useful flux but that spurious fields are intercepted in an

optimum manner.
A magnetic-head device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 the end face (11a) disposed between the additional limbs (12) is
narrowed in a direction transverse to the transport direction of the magnetic tape (14).
A magnetic-head device as claimed in Claim 3,
characterized in that
 the residual contact face (11'a) of the magnetic head (10') has a
constriction (20) at both sides in the area of the active air gap (15').
A magnetic-head device as claimed in Claim 4,
characterized by
 a semicircular (20), triangular or trapezoidal constriction.
A magnetic-head device as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that
 each magnetic head (10, 10') has been manufactured with integral
additional limbs (12).
A magnetic-head device as claimed in Claim 6,
characterized in that
 the gap (13) and the residual contact face (11'a) with the constrictions
(20), if any, are manufactured by means of a laser technique.
A magnetic-head device as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that
 each magnetic head has been assembled from separate parts.
A magnetic-head device as claimed in any one of the Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that
 in addition to the head winding (16) each magnetic head (10, 10')
carries a short-circuit winding (17).
A magnetic-head device as claimed in Claim 9,
characterized in that
 the short-circuit winding (17) is formed by a turn of wire or foil
connected by soldering or laser-welding.
A magnetic-head device as claimed in Claim 9,
characterized in that
 the short-circuit winding consists of a plurality of turns of wire wound
over the head winding (16) and short-circuited.
A magnetic-head device as claimed in Claim 9,
characterized in that
 the short-circuit winding is a closed ring threaded into the gap (13).
