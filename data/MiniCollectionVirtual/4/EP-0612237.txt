<ABSTRACT>
A parturition bed having a lying surface (1) transversely divided into two mutually adjustable parts has a main supporting part (2) and a leg supporting part (3) that may be adjusted from a common lying plane into planes approximately parallel to the lying plane located at different heights with respect to each other. The leg supporting part (3) can be moved when it is in a lowered position in relation to the main supporting part (3) can be moved when it is in a lowered position in relation to the main supporting part (2) in the longitudinal direction of the parturition bed into a free space located below the main supporting part (2), at least in the pelvis supporting area of the latter. In order to allow the parturient to take any desired position, including a vertical position, during childbirth, while ensuring easy access to the doctor and midwife, the main supporting part (2) is supported on an overhanging beam (6) with relation to a main stay (5) arranged at the head end of the main supporting part (2) and supported on the floor (4), and can be lifted into a higher position and lowered back again by an adusting mechanism (8, 9, 11, 12, 13).

Parturition bed with a lying surface (1) transversely divided into two mutually 
adjustable parts i.e., a main supporting part (2) providing support for the pelvis and upper part 

of the body of the parturient, and a leg supporting part (3) providing support for her legs, 
wherein both the main supporting part (2) and the leg supporting part (3) are adjustable 

relative to each other from a common lying plane located at a predetermined specified height in 
planes approximately parallel to this lying plane and at varying heights i.e., an adjustment 

mechanism (29, 32) allows the leg supporting part (3) to be lowered and raised, and wherein 
the leg supporting part (3) when it is in a lowered position relative to the main supporting part 

(2) is displaceable in the longitudinal direction of the parturition bed into the free space below 
the main supporting part (2), at least into the pelvis supporting portion of the latter,
 
characterized in that the main supporting part (2) is supported on a carrier (6) cantilevering 

from a main stay (5) arranged on the head end of the main supporting part (2) and is liftable 
from the specified lying level into a higher position, and lowerable back again by means of an 

adjustment mechanism (8, 9, 11, 12, 13) independently of the leg supporting part (3). 
A parturition bed according to claim 1, characterized in that the main supporting part 
(2) and the leg supporting part (3) can be lifted and lowered continuously. 
A parturition bed according to claim 2, characterized in that the main supporting part 
(2) can be lifted, lowered and inclined relative to the carrier (6) arranged rigidly on the rigid 

main stay (5). 
A parturition bed according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that when in a lowered 
position, the leg supporting part (3) can be brought below the carrier (6) supporting the main 

supporting part (2). 
A parturition bed according to one or several of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
main supporting part (2) can be inclined at various angles by means of the adjustment 

mechanism (8, 9, 11, 12, 13). 
A parturition bed according to one or several of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the 
main supporting part (2) comprises a back section (14) and pelvis section (15) which are 

jointed to each other and can be inclined independently at different angles.  
 
A parturition bed according to one or several of claims 2 to 6, characterized in that a 
guide rail (25) along which the leg supporting part (3) can be moved is arranged at the main 

stay (5) in such a way as to point towards the cantilevering carrier (6) supporting the main 
supporting part (2). 
A parturition bed according to one or several of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the 
leg supporting part (3) is completely detachable from the main supporting part (2), the leg 

supporting part (3) being supported on a separate supporting structure (23) provided 
independent of the main stay (5) of the main supporting part (2) by means of swivel arms (29). 
A parturition bed according to one or several of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the 
one end of the leg supporting part (3) that faces the main supporting part (2) is provided with a 

preferably semicircular part (34) that projects convexly and locks with a concave indentation 
(35) arranged in a matching counterposition on the main supporting part (2), whenever the 

main supporting part (2) and the leg supporting part (3) are at the same height. 
A parturition bed according to one or several of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that a 
rest (36) is provided that is attachable at the head of the main supporting part (2), preferably at 

the height of the carrier (6) supporting the main supporting part (2), and/or at the foot of the 
leg supporting part (3). 
A parturition bed according to one or several of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that 
combined hand grips and supports (37) and/or leg supports (38) are provided. 
A parturition bed according to claim 7, characterized in that the leg supporting part (3) 
is connectible with the guide rail (25) by means of brake shoes (27) acting on the guide rail 

(25) and is guided on the guide rail (25) by means of guide rollers (26). 
A parturition bed according to claim 8, characterized in that the leg supporting part (3) 

is supported on the foundation (4) by means of supporting rollers (24) bearing-mounted on its 
supporting structure (23). 
A parturition bed according to claim 13, characterized in that the supporting rollers 
(24) of the leg supporting part (3) are in the form of lockable castors.  

 
A parturition bed according to one or several of claims 1 to 14, characterized in that
