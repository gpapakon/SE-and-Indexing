<ABSTRACT>
A lubrication system for a gas turbine engine includes first (26) 
and second (28) coaxially 

rotor shafts having at least one differential bearing disposed in outer 
and inner seats 

thereof. An annular first scoop (58) extends axially from a first 
portion of the first shaft, and an 

annular second scoop (68) extends axially from the inner seat of the 
second shaft. A plurality 

of first holes (60) extend axially through the first shaft (26) and 
radially below the first scoop (58), and 

a plurality of second holes (70) extend axially through the inner seat 
of the second shaft (28) and 

below the second scoop (68). An annular first shell (72) extends axially 
between the second scoop (68) 

and the first shaft (26) from above the first holes (60). And, oil is 
injected under the first scoop (58) for 

flow by centrifugal force from rotation of the first shaft (26) through 
the first holes (60) and along 

the first shell (72) into the second scoop (68) for flow through the 

second holes (70) to lubricate the bearing (56).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines, and, more 
specifically, to a lubrication system therein. In one type of gas turbine engine, forward and aft fans are joined to respective drum 
rotors of a counter-rotating power turbine for being powered thereby. A first rotor shaft 
joins the outer drum to the aft fan, and a second rotor shaft joins the inner drum to the 
forward fan and extends concentrically inside the first shaft. The first and second shafts 
are suitably supported by bearings to stationary frames in the engine. Conventional bearings typically are provided with lubrication oil through oil injectors 
located adjacent thereto. However, since the second shaft is disposed inside the first shaft 
and rotates in an opposite direction, the required bearings therebetween are not readily 
accessible for supplying lubrication oil thereto. US-A-4265334 discloses a lubrication system for a gas 
turbine engine comprising a first tubular rotor shaft 
including an outer surface and an inner surface disposed 
coaxially about a centerline axis, a first portion, and an 
outer seat spaced axially from said first portion; a second 
tubular rotor shaft disposed coaxially about said 
centerline axis and spaced radially inwardly from said 
first shaft and including a first-portion and an inner seat 
aligned axially with said first outer seat; a differential  
 
first bearing disposed in said first outer and inner seats; 
an annular first scoop extending axially from said first 
shaft outer surface at said first portion thereof; a 
plurality of circumferentially spaced apart first holes 
extending axially through said first shaft radially below 
said first scoop and in flow communication therewith; and 
means for injecting oil under said first scoop for flow by 
centrifugal force from rotation of said first shaft through 
said first holes. According to the invention there is provided a 
lubrication system for a gas turbine engine having the 
features recited in claim 1.  
 The invention, in accordance with preferred and exemplary embodiments, together 
with further objects and advantages thereof, is more particularly described in the following 
detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which: Figure 1 is a schematic, longitudinal sectional view of the upper half of an 
exemplary gas turbine engine having counter-rotating fans powered by a counter-rotating 
power turbine through first and second coaxial shafts having differential bearings 
therebetween
