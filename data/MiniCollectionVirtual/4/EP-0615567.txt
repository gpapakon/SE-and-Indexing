<ABSTRACT>
A composite comprising two glazed angled masonry building units. Each masonry building unit includes a glazed front face (3) including a planar portion (4) that is opposed a back face (5) and a second segment (6) that intersects the planar portion (4). The second segment (6) forms an obtuse angle with the planar portion (4) and has a length that is equal to or shorter than the length of the planar portion (4). A side face (8) of the building unit is angled and intersects the second segment (6) and the back face (5). This side face (8) forms an obtuse angle with the back face (5) and an angle with the second segment (6) of the front face (3). Also provided is a mold and method for producing glazed masonry building units. In addition, a wall corner composite comprising one of the glazed angled masonry units and a mitred stretcher is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of my copending U. S.
Application S.N. 919,988 filed July 27, 1992 and entitled
"Wall Corner Composite, Mold and Method for Producing
Glazed Unit For Such," which in turn is a continuation-in-part
of S.N. 07/795,773 filed November 21, 1991 and
entitled "Wall Corner Composite, Mold and Method for
Producing Glazed Unit for Such," entire disclosures of
which are incorporated herein by reference.The present invention is concerned with forming corners in
a wall construction containing at least two glazed masonry
building units of particular configuration. In addition,
the present invention is concerned with columns or
portions thereof constructed from at least two glazed
masonry building units of particular configuration. The
present invention is also concerned with a method
for providing the glazed masonry building units employed
to provide the wall corner construction of the present
invention. The present invention is also concerned with
masonry building units, including glazed and unglazed
units, for forming reinforced corners in a wall
construction.EP-A-0443074 discloses hollow glass blocks, composed of two
halves fused together and having an elongated hexagonal cross
section, for erecting structuresFilled polymeric materials have been known to provide
decorative and protective surfaces to walls. For
instance, it has been known to coat masonry units filled
with polyesters and to form walls therefrom. The basic
patent on the use of polyester as coatings for masonry 
units is U.S. Patent 2,751,775 to Sergovic and assigned to
the assignee of the present application. Over the years,
a number of improvements in the coating compositions for
the masonry building units have been developed. For
instance, U.S. Patent 3,328,231 to Sergovic and assigned
to the assignee of the present application, discloses a
glazed masonry building block made of a cured composition
of an unsaturated polyester resin and sand in which the
sand comprises at least 50% by weight of the coating
composition. The unsaturated polyester is derived from a
reaction between a dicarboxylic acid, such as phthalic,
maleic, fumaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, itaconic,
citraconic, succinic acids, and/or an anhydride thereof,
and a polyhydric alcohol such as ethylene glycol,
diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol. Also present in
such compositions is an unsaturated monomer, such as
methyl methacrylate, styrene, diallyl phthalate, t-butyl
styrene,and alphamethyl styrene. Furthermore, U.S. Patent

<CLAIMS>
A wall corner composite comprising at least two glazed angled masonry
building units (1), each comprising a front face (3) intended to be exposed,

glazed with a resinous composition (2), a back face (5), a top face, a
bottom face (10) and two side faces (7, 8), wherein said front face (3)

comprises a planar portion (4) that is opposite to said back face (5) and a
secon
d segment (6) that intersects said planar portion (4) to thereby form
an obtuse, acute or right angle (A) and the length of said second segment

(6) is shorter than the length of said planar portion (4), characterized in that
the side faces (8)

of the two units facing each other to form said wall corner are
angled, each intersecting both said second segment (6)

and said back face (5) and forming an obtuse angle (C) with said back face (5)
and forming an angle (B) with said second segment (6).
The composite of claim 1, wherein the length of said second
segment (6) is less than the length of the intersecting side face (8).
The composite of claim 1, wherein the length of said second
segment (6) is 75% or less of the length of said side face (8).
The composite of claim 1, wherein said second segment (6)
is not longer than 61,25 mm (2½ inches).
The composite of claim 1, wherein also a return lip (8A) of a
minor portion of the angled side wall (8) that intersects said front face (3)

is glazed.
The composite of claim 1, wherein the said glazed angled
masonry building units (1) are of different thicknesses. 
The composite of claim 6. wherein the angle (A) at the
intersection of the planar portion (4) and of the second segment (6) of

each unit is about 135°; the sum of the angle (C) at the intersection of the
angled side face (8) and of the back face (5) of each unit is 270° and the

sum of the angle (B) at the intersection of the angled side face (8) and of
the second segment (6) of the front face (3) of each unit is 180°.
The composite of claim 1 being a column composite or
portion thereof wherein the angled side face (8) of one of said angled

glazed units is opposed the opposite side face (7) of an adjacent angled
glazed unit.

A method for fabricating a glazed masonry unit of the
composite of claim 1 which comprises the steps of applying a glaze

composition to a horizontal bottom inner surface (11) of a mold (11, 12, ...,
18), placing a shaped block (1) in the mold wherein said block (1) has a

front face (3) that includes a planar portion (4) and an angled segment (6)
