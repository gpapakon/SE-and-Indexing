<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a bristle roller (1), which has been 
particularly designed for automatic systems for washing motor vehicles and 

the like, which comprises a cylindrical body on the periphery whereof there 
are provided a plurality of bristles (6). 
The main feature of the invention is that, on the surface of the roller (1), 
there are provided a first region (2), extending along a first cylindrical 

helix and being provided with a plurality of bristles (3) arranged with a 
dense arrangement, and a second region (5), extending along a second 

cylindric helix, which is complementary to the first cylindric helix, and 
being provided with bristles (3) which are less dense than those of the first 

region, these bristles (3) having the same length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bristled 
roller, which has been particularly designed for 
automatic washing systems for washing motor vehicles 
and the like. As is known, in automatic systems for washing 
motor vehicles and the like, there are conventionally 
used cylindric rollers which are provided, 
on their outer surface or periphery, with a plurality 
of bristles, having a set length, which are 
caused to contact the surface of the motor vehicle 
to be washed, in order to remove dust therefrom. From experimental texts, Applicant has 
found that the above mentioned prior rollers, after 
a good operation starting step, are practically 
clogged by dust, since the latter can not be discharged 
to the outside and accordingly is accumulated 
at the bottoms or roots of the bristles. In order to overcome the above mentioned 
drawbacks, there have been already designed washing 
rollers including different length bristles. This approach, while being better than the 
prior art, is also affected by some drawbacks, 
mainly because of the uneven wear of the bristles.  Accordingly, the aim of the present invention 
is to overcome the above drawbacks, by providing 
a bristled roller, which has been particularly 
designed for application to automatic motor vehicle 
washing systems and the like, which affords the possibility 
of easily removing dust during its operation. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim, a main object of the present invention is to 
provide such a washing roller the bristles of which 
are worn in an even manner, thereby holding unaltered 
for a long time the efficiency of the roller. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a washing roller which, owing to 
its specifically designed construction, is very 
reliable and safe in operation. Yet another object of the present invention 
is to provide such a washing roller which can be 
easily made starting from easily available elements 
and materials and which, moreover, is very competitive 
from a mere economic standpoint. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
the above mentioned aim and objects, as  
 
well as yet other objects, which will become more 
apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a bristled 
roller, particularly designed for automatic washing 
systems for washing motor vehicles and the 
like, comprising a cylindric body on the surface 
of which there are provided a plurality of bristles, 
characterized in that said roller further comprises, 
on its surface, a first region extending along

vehicles and the like, comprising a cylindric body 
on the surface of which there are provided a plurality 

of bristles, characterized in that said roller 
further comprises, on its surface, a first region 

extending along a first cylindric helix, including 
dense bristles and a second region, extending along 

a second cylindric helix, complementary to said 
first cylindric helix and including bristles which 

are less dense than those of the first region and 
have the same length of said bristles of said first 

region. 
A bristled roller, specifically designed 
for automatic washing s
ystems for motor vehicles 
and the like, comprising a cylindric body on the 

surface whereof there are provided a plurality of 
bristles, characterized in that said roller comprises, 

on the surface thereof, a first region extending 
along a cylindric helix, and including bristles 

having a larger cross-section, and a second region, 
extending along a second cylindric helix, complementary 

to the first cylindric helix, and including bristles 
 

of smaller cross-section, the bristles of said 
first and second regions having the same length. 
A bristled roller, specifically designed 
for automatic washing system for washing motor 

vehicles and the like, comprising a roller cylindric 
body on the surface of which there are provided a 

plurality of bristles, characterized in that said 
roller further comprises, on its said surface, a 

first region extending along a first cylindric helix, 
including a plurality of bristles having a greater 

stiffness than that of the bristles of the second 
region, extending along a second cylindric helix complementary 

to the first cylindric helix, the bristles 
of said first and second regions having the same 

length. 
A bristled roller according to one or 
more of the preceding claims, characterized in that 

said bristles are supported by modular elements provided 
for application to said roller body and including 

a first diamond like region with the first plurality 
of bristles, adjoining triangular regions with 

a second plurality of bristles, and in that said 
modular element can be folded in order to provide an 

 
annular pattern defining, by arranging the modular 

elements adjoining one another on said roller body, 
a cylindric helix pattern.
