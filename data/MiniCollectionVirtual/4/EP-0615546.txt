<DESCRIPTION>
REGION OF CYTOPLASMIC DOMAIN OF THE HUMAN INTERLEUKIN-4 RECEPTOR, AS ANTAGONISTS OF IL-4This invention relates to antagonists of human interleukin-4 that are based upon a critical region of the 5 cytoplasmic domain of the human interleukin-4 receptor.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENÎ—ONInterleukin-4 (IL-4) is a protein which affects a broad spectrum of hematopoietic cells [Strober et al., Pediatr. Res. 24:549 (1988)]. IL-4 enhances a number of activities in 0 human beings, including macrophage function, IgGl and IgE production, and the proliferation of immunoglobulin- stimulated B cells, antigen-stimulated T cells and erythropoietin-stimulated red blood cell progenitors. It also increases the proliferation of IL-3-stimulated mast cells.5 Together with IgE, mast cells play a central role in allergic reactions. Mast cells are granule-containing connective tissue cells which are located proximally to capillaries throughout the body, with especially high concentrations in the lungs, skin and gastrointestinal and 0 genitourinary tracts. Following exposure to an antigenic substance, mast cells degranulate and release chemical mediators such as histamine, serotonin, heparin, prostaglandins etc. to produce an allergic reaction.Allergic reactions, e.g., to dust, pollen or organic 5 detritus, may cause minor discomfort through allergic rhinitis, sneezing or tearing, or more serious problems. More serious reactions, e.g., asthma or food or drug allergies, may cause severe discomfort or medical problems. Some very severe reactions such as anaphy lactic shock can be life threatening. 

 In 1989, 46 million Americans suffered from some allergy: 25 million from hayfever, 9 million from asthma and 12 million from other allergies.D -4 exerts biological effects through cell surface-specific receptors on target cells. Binding analyses have demonstrated that relatively small numbers (up to about 5,000 receptors/cell) of a single class of high affinity IL-4 receptor (Kd = 20-100 pM) are expressed on many types of iurine and human cells of hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic origin. See, e.g., papers by Ohara et al. [Nature 325:531(1987)], Nakajima et al. [J. Immunol. 139:114 (1987)], Park et al. iProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:1669 (1987)], Park et al. [J. Exp. Med. 166:416 (1987)], Cabrillat et al. [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 149:995 (1987)] and Lowenthal et al. [/. Immunol. 140:456 (1988)].Cross-linking studies have led to the characterization of a family of IL-4 binding proteins having molecular weights of 140, 80 and 70 kilodaltons
