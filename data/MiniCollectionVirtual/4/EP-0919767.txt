<ABSTRACT>
The power plant has a gas turbine circuit and a steam turbine circuit, with the residual heat of the exhaust gas from the gas turbine (4) transferred to the working medium for the steam turbine (9,10). A condensate separator flask (25) is provided between the steam generator (22) and the superheater (23) , the steam generator coupled to the top of the separator flask via a steam line (31) and to the bottom of the separator flask via a water line (33).

<CLAIMS>
Combined gas/steam power plant with a gas-turbine
circuit and a steam-turbine circuit, in which

plant the exhaust gases from a gas turbine (4)
discharge their residual heat to a steam turbine

(9, 10) via the working medium flowing in a once-through
steam generator (7), a separation bottle

(25) for the separation of water and for the blow-down
of impurities being arranged in the once-through

steam generator between the evaporator
(22) and the superheater (23), for which purpose

the outlet header (22b) of the evaporator (22) is
connected to the upper part of the separation

bottle (25) via a steam line (31), 
characterized
in that
 the outlet header (22b) of the evaporator
(22) is connected to the lower part of the

separation bottle (25) via a water line (33).
Power plant according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 a throttle element (28) is arranged in the
steam line (31) from the outlet header (22b) to

the separation bottle (25).
