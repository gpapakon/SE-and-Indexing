<ABSTRACT>
In the process according to the invention for the purification of salt-laden waste water by wet oxidation of organic constituents at supercritical conditions, the reaction is carried out in the form of a flame (5). The supercritical zone is enclosed by a subcritical jacket stream (4) formed from cooling water. At one end of the reactor (1) designed as a cylindrical pressure vessel at least one burner nozzle (2) and at least one annular cooling water feed position (48) surrounding the burner nozzle are provided; at the other end, at least one collective exit position (160) for cooling water, reaction products and, in particular, precipitated salts are arranged. Because of the jacket stream, there are no blockages due to salts; corrosion problems are substantially neutralised.

A process for the purification of salt-charged waste
water by wet oxidation of organic constituents under

supercritical conditions, during which process the
waste water, which is preheated and also in addition

mixed with a fuel, is reacted together with an
oxygenous fluid in a supercritical zone in the

central region of a cylindrical reactor, whereby the
salts precipitating during the reaction are

transported into a subcritical zone and from there
as a solid-liquid mixture or in the dissolved state

from the reactor,
characterised in that
 the subcritical zone is
produced by means of a by-pass flow (4) formed from

cooling water, by which the supercritical zone (3)
is enveloped,
in that
 the reaction is performed in the form of a
flame (5),
and in that
 the reaction products are removed from
the reactor (1) mixed with the cooling water.
A process according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 under normal conditions the
fuel is gaseous,
and in that
 in particular it substantially consists
of methane.
A process according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the oxygenous fluid is a
single-phase mixture of water and oxygen or air.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the flame is a diffusion
flame. 
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the flame is a premixing
flame.
A process according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 a pilot flame is produced with
a fuel-containing fluid.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 a stable lamination is
produced with a rotating by-pass flow.
A reactor (1) for performing the process according
to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that
 at one end of the reactor
constructed as a cylindrical pressure vessel are

provided at least one burner nozzle (2) and at least
one annular inlet point (48) for the cooling water

surrounding the burner nozzle,
and in that
 at the other end is disposed at least
one common outlet point (160) for cooling water and

reaction products.
A reactor according to Claim 8,
characterised in that
 the reactor axis is aligned
substantially vertically,
and in that
 the outlet point (160) is disposed at
the top.
A reactor according to one of Claims 8 or 9,
characterised in that
 a flame holder device (55) is
provided over the burner nozzle (2).
A reactor according to one of Claims 8 to 10,
characterised in that
 two by-pass flows (4a, 4b) are
provided, which are largely separated by a pipe

(110).
