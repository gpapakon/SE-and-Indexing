<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a method for evaluation of the 
safety of a chemical compound, which includes the steps of: 

(a) reacting a chemical compound with recombinant yeast cells 
expressing, or in other words producing, human cytochrome P450 

molecular species P450 1A2, P450 2C9, P450 2E1 and P450 3A4 
together with a yeast NADPH-P450 reductase, which may be in 

the form of a fused enzyme with each of said human cytochrome 
P450 molecular species, or with the cell free extracts of the 

yeast cells; and (b) analyzing the resulting metabolite to 
determine the safety of the compound. According to this 

method, it can be determined whether a test compound will be 
converted into a carcinogenic or mutagenic form through the 

metabolism in the human liver, and whether the test compound 
or its metabolite has mutagenicity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for evaluation
of the safety of a chemical compound using recombinant
yeasts expressing human cytochrome P450.The cytochrome P450 is an enzyme catalyzing the
mono-oxygenation of a substance in the human liver.In the past there have been several approaches to
combine the monoxygenase activity of a cytochrome P450 with
the reducing power supplying ability derived from NADPH-cytochrome
P450.WO-A-9 308 260 discloses a method for degrading
complex chemical mixtures such as crude oils by using at least
one eukaryotic (including mammalian) P450 expressed in yeast
cells. Further, this publication generally reviews a number
of prior art documents relating to the construction of enzymes
and expression methods.US-A-5 111 852 discloses the production of a fused
enzyme from rat liver CYP1A1 and rat reductase. JP-A-02 249 488
and JP-A-02 023 870 specifically disclose the production of a
fused enzyme from bovine adrenal cytochrome P450c21 and yeast
NADPH-P450 reductase. However, there is no disclosure of a
fused enzyme from a human liver P450. It is known that recombinant human cells expressing
heterogeneous human cytochrome P450 species have been used for the
determination of metabolisms and toxicities of chemical
substances. However, this method is unsatisfactory as a
method of evaluation of the safety of chemical compounds
partly because the kinds of the human cytochrome P450 species
expressed by the cells and the levels of the expression are
so limited that the amount of metabolite obtained is not
enough for determination of the metabolism and toxicity, and
partly because it requires not only a high density culture
technique but a high cultivation cost. Accordingly, there has
been a great demand for developing an advantageous method.As a result of the extensive study, the present
inventors have found that yeasts are particularly suitable as
hosts for production of human cytochrome P450 and yeast
NADPH-P450 reductase to be used in in vitro determination of
metabolisms and toxicities of chemical substances because 
yeasts grow so rapidly and can stably express both the human
cytochrome P450 and yeast NADPH-P450 reductase at high
expression levels to provide sufficient amounts of the
metabolites in a short period of time, thereby enabling a
precise and quick analysis of the metabolites.Moreover, they have also found that, despite that
there are a considerable number of human cytochrome P450
molecular species, the human metabolic system for chemical
compounds can be reproduced
