<ABSTRACT>
A holding apparatus (1) which can be integrated in osseous tissues and is preferably provided for the electrical transmission of information to the inner ear, comprises an insertion end (2) for insertion of the holding apparatus in a prepared bore in the osseous tissue, an external connection end (3), a continuous centered bore (4) which connects the two ends (2, 3) of the body, an external screw thread (7) provided on the insertion end and a contact element (9) arranged in the bore and provided with an electrical conductor (8). The conductor (8) starts from the contact element and extends through the bore at the insertion end and/or openings in the surface of the body (1).
