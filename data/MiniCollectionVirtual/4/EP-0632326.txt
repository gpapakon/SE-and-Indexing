The present invention provides an imaging element comprising on a 
flexible hydrophobic support (i) a hardened hydrophilic layer, 

containing a hydrophilic synthetic homocopolymer or copolymer and 
being hardened with a hydrolyzed tetraalkyl orthosilicate 

crosslinking agent, (ii) a receiving layer containing physical 
development nuclei contiguous to said hydrophilic layer, (iii) an 

intermediate layer comprising a non-proteinic hydrophilic 
film-forming polymer or hydrophobic polymer beads having an average 

diameter not lower than 0.2 µm and having been prepared by 
polymerization of a ethylenically unsaturated monomer and (iv) a 

photosensitive layer containing a silver halide emulsion being in 
water permeable relationship with said receiving layer. The

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an imaging element for making
improved lithographic printing plates according to the silver salt
diffusion transfer process. Furthermore the present invention
relates to a method for making improved lithographic printing plates
with said imaging element.The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described e.g. in
US-P 2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion
Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London
and New York, (1972).In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into
an image-receiving element and are reduced therein with a developing
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to
form a silver image having reversed image density values
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the
exposed areas of the photographic material.A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the
water-repellant ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive
ink-repellant background. For example, typical lithographic printing
plates are disclosed e.g. EP-A-423399 and EP-A-410500.The DTR-image can be formed in the image-receiving layer of a
sheet or web material which is a separate element with respect to
the photographic silver halide emulsion material (a so-called
two-sheet DTR-element) or in the image-receiving layer of a
so-called single-support element, also called mono-sheet element,
which contains at least one photographic silver halide emulsion
layer integral with an image-receiving layer in waterpermeable
relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet version which is
preferred for the preparation of offset printing plates by the DTR 
method.According to the preferred embodiment of the mono-sheet DTR-offset
printing plate, disclosed in e.g. US-P-4,722,535 and
GB-P-1,241,661, a flexible support e.g. paper or an organic resin is
provided in the order given with a silver halide emulsion layer and
a layer containing physical development nuclei serving as the image-receiving
layer. After information-wise exposure and development the
imaged element is used as a printing plate without the removal of
the now-useless emulsion layers.Offset printing plates with a
