<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to anticancer compounds 
and a preparation process thereof, and more specifically 
to novel anticancer compounds contained in 
Rui-xiang-lang-du, that is, a Chinese herbal and crude 
drug, and a preparation process thereof. Chinese herbal and crude drugs can be stated as 
the fruit of long-established wisdom of human beings. 
Confirming the existence of strong carcinostatic activities 
in Rui-xiang-lang-du (Stellera chamaejasme. L, 
Euphorbia fischeriana Steud., E.ebiacteola Hayata) in the 
course of a study on carcinostatic Chinese herbal and 
crude drugs, the essences of whose carcinostatic activities 
have not yet been identified, the present inventors 
filed a patent application on a process for the 
collection of its carcinostatic substance (Japanese 
Patent Application No. 58126/1990). The application, 
however, did not deal to such an extent as efficiently 
isolating a compound having carcinostatic activities 
and confirming its effectiveness against solid cancer.  The present inventors have proceeded with further 
research on a carcinostatically active component contained 
in the carcinostatic substance of Rui-xiang-lang-du, 
resulting in successful isolation of a component 
contributing to the carcinostatic activities of 
Rui-xiang-lang-du. In addition, the component has also 
been found to contain a novel compound represented by 
the formula described below. Namely, a first object of the present invention 
is to provide stelleramacrin A and stelleramacrin B 
represented by the following formulas (I) and (II), 
respectively: 
   A second object of the present invention is to 
provide a process for the preparation of stelleramacrin 
A or stelleramacrin B from Rui-xiang-lang-du. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide an anticancer agent containing stelleramacrin A 
or stelleramacrin B. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a therapeutic for solid cancer, said 
therapeutic containing gnidimacrin or pimelea factor P₂ 
as an active ingredient. FIG 1 is a proton NMR spectrum of stelleramacrin 
A according to the present invention. FIG. 2 is a proton NMR spectrum of stelleramacrin 
B.  Stelleramacrin A and stelleramacrin B (which may 
hereinafter be collectively called "stelleramacrin") 
according to the present invention, which are 
represented by the formulas (I) and (II), respectively, 
can each be obtained by extracting an aerial or subterranean 
part (rootstock) of Rui-xiang-lang-du with an 
organic solvent and then purifying the

<CLAIMS>
Stelleramacrin A or stelleramacrin B 
represented respectively by the following formulas (I) 

and (II): 

A process for the preparation of stelleramacrin 
A or stelleramacrin B, which comprises extracting 

a subterranean or aerial part of Rui-xiang-lang-du 
with a lower alcohol, extracting the extract 

with a water-insoluble organic solvent, isolating a 
 

stelleramacrin-A-containing fraction or a 
stelleramacrin-B-containing fraction from the resulting 

extract, and then purifying the isolated fraction. 
An anticancer agent comprising stelleramacrin 
A or stelleramacrin B as an active ingredient. 
A therapeutic for solid cancer, said 
therapeutic comprising gnidimacrin or pimelea factor P₂ 

as an active ingredient.
