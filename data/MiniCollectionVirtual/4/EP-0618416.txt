<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus are disclosed for dielectrically 
drying green ceramic or wet honeycomb structures (W), 

by rotating such structures about their longitudinal axis (A) 

between a pair of parallel dielectric electrodes (40) and 
simultaneously blowing heated air through the longitudinal 

cells of the honeycomb structure (W). Preferably the dielectric 
electrodes (40) are oriented parallel with the longitudinal axis (A) 

of the honeycomb structure (W), and the rotation thereof between 
the electrodes accordingly results in a more uniform energy 

transfer to the honeycomb structure by leveling out the non-uniformities 
and variations in the dielectric field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The inventon relates to a method and an apparatus for drying a
wet honeycomb structure having cells extending longitudinally
therethrough parallel to a longitudinal axis of said honeycomb
structure.Thin-walled honeycomb structures have utility as a catalyst
substrate or as a diesel particulate filter. Such substrates
may be formed from extrudable material such as particulate
ceramic and/or metal batches which may be sintered, and
similar materials which have the property of being able to
flow or plastically deform during extrusion, while being able
to become sufficiently rigid immediately thereafter so as to
maintain their stuctural integrity, in the manner set forth in
U.S. Patent Nos. 3,790,654 and 4,758,272. Alternatively, the
honeycomb structure may be made of pleated thin porous sheets
of filter material whose layers are interleaved with
corrugated or crimped spacers with parallel corrugations or
crimps thereof extending substantially perpendicular to the
folds or the pleated sheets, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.
2,884,091, 2,952,333 and 3,242,649.The invention more particularly relates to improved method and
apparatus for drying wet honeycomb structures, formed of such
particulate material or sheets, of virtually any desired size
and shape or transverse cross-section. Honeycomb ware is
typically manufactured by extruding or fabricating ceramic
material into logs, followed by the drying, cutting and firing
of such ceramic logs. The drying of such honeycomb logs must
be done very carefully in order to not induce stresses in the
honeycomb ware pieces, produced by non-uniform drying and
shrinkage, which can create distortion, warping or cracking.
Conventional convection or oven drying cannot be used,
particularly with the relatively large logs required for
diesel particulate filters, since by its nature, convection 
drying dries the ware from the outside inwardly, and the early
outside drying results in the shrinking of the outer layers,
thereby invariably leading to cracking or distortion,
rendering the product unusable.Some forms of dielectric drying through the use of dielectric
heating have been utilized in the past. However, due to non-uniform
radio frequency fields between the dielectric
electrodes and the orientation of such electrodes relative to
the honeycomb ware, the results obtained with such prior art
devices and methods were not entirely satisfactory. Typically,
the larger green ceramic honeycomb structures were initially
subjected to dielectric drying for about 25 minutes followed

A method of drying a wet honeycomb structure having cells
defined by cell walls, said cells extending longitudinally

therethrough parallel to a longitudinal axis of said
honeycomb structure which comprises:


rotating said honeycomb structure about its longitudinal
axis between a pair of dielectric electrodes, and

applying RF energy to said dielectric electrodes for a
desired period of time at which water evaporation from

the cell walls is substantially uniform throughout the
surface of the structure while said honeycomb structure

is rotated about its longitudinal axis therebetween to
produce uniform dielectric heating and drying of said
