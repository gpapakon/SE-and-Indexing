<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to razor
blade structures and more particularly to a
guard for use in a razor blade body member.It is known in the prior art to
provide a razor blade assembly which may be
connected to and used in conjunction with a
razor handle to facilitate shaving operations.
In U.S. Patent Number 3,724,070, issued
April 3, 1973, in the name of Francis W. Dorion,
Jr., there is shown a blade assembly in which
blade means are held between the blade assembly
surfaces adapted to engage the surface being
shaved in front of and behind, respectively,
cutting edge portions of the blade means. Such
surfaces are generally referred to in the prior
art as "guard" and "cap' surfaces.In various blade assemblies shown in
the prior art the guard, cap and blade means
have been disclosed in various forms and in
order to increase shaving efficiency and in some
instances the individual components have been
designed to move in response to forces
encountered during shaving. In U.S. Patent
Number 4,168,571, issued September 25, 1979, in
the name of John F. Francis, there is shown a 
blade assembly in which the guard, cap and blade
means are each movable independently of each
other in dynamic fashion. U.S. Patent Number
4,270,268, issued June 2, 1981, in the name of
Chester F. Jacobson, shows a blade assembly in
which the guard and blade means are
independently movable. Various other patents
show a combination of guard, blade, and cap
arrangements which are known, for instance U.S.
Patent Number 4,270,268, U.S. Patent Number
4,488,357, U.S. Patent Number 4,492,024, U.S.
Patent Number 4,492,025, U.S. Patent Number
4,498,235, U.S. Patent Number 4,551,916, U.S.
Patent Number 4,573,266, U.S. Patent Number
4,586,255, U.S. Patent Number 4,378,634, U.S.
Patent Number 4,587,729, and U.S. Patent Number
4,621,424, all issued in the name of Chester F.
Jacobson and assigned to the assignee of the
present invention.Further, in EP-A-0 366 139, filed October 26, 1989,
there is disclosed a
skin engaging guard surface to be employed in
the manner of guard surfaces disclosed in the
above-referenced patents, which is designed to
promote pleasant tactile sensations in the use
of the razor and which tend to mask the
sensations caused by contact of the blade edges
with the skin and more significantly the facial
hairs as they are severed. In the various
embodiments of the referenced Patent Application
EP-A-0 366 139, the skin engaging
surfaces are provided, in one form or another
with projections, arrayed in a substantial
number so
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A razor blade assembly including a body
structure (24), at least one blade, and an

elongated guard member (10), said guard meter
having a wall extending parallel with the blade and

disposed forward of the blade
as seen in the direction in which, in use, the blade is moved

for shaving,
and a plurality of

protrusions extending upwardly therefrom for
contacting the surface to which the blade is

applied,
the upward direction being a direction generally perpendicular

to the surface to which, in use, the blade is applied, 
characterized in that said guard member

includes a unitary molded member being formed of a
bottom base portion (12, 112) of rigid plastics

material providing a surface extending downwardly
(13) for juxtaposition adjacent the wall (48) of

the body structure along the length of the guard
and an upper portion (18,118) of elastomeric

material having said plurality of upwardly
projecting protrusions, and in that latch means is

disposed on said base portion for engagement with
said body structure to retain said guard member as

positioned in the blade body structure.
An assembly according to claim 1,
characterized in that said latch means comprises a

plurality of openings formed in an outer surface of
said guard base portion (12, 112) for receiving a

detent (30, 32) disposed on the blade body
structure (24).
An assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that the body structure (24)

further has a pair of upwardly projecting elements
(26) in spaced relation, one forward of the other

forming a recess therebetween, in that the bottom
base portion (12, 112) of the guard member has a

substantially V-shaped cross section extending
downwardly for interfitting engagement in said

recess between said body structure upwardly
projecting elements and in that said latch means is

disposed in said recess for interconnecting said
base portion to at least one of said pair of

upwardly projecting elements for retaining said 
guard member so positioned in said razor blade body

structure.
An assembly according to claim 3,
characterized in that said latch means comprises a

plurality of openings (38,39) formed in an outer
surface of said guard base portion (12,112) and a

corresponding plurality of detents (30,32) formed
on at least one of said body structure upwardly

projecting elements (26) received in said openings.
An assembly according to claim 4,
characterized in that one of said body structure

upwardly projecting elements (26) comprises an
elongated wall extended parallel to the blade or

blades of said body structure and serving to
substantially support said guard member (10).
An assembly according to any of the previous
claims, characterized in that said guard base

portion (12,112) and said guard upper portion
(18,118) are injection molded together in a two

stage injection molding process.
An assembly according to claim 6,
characterized in that one of said guard portions is

provided with a plurality of apertures into which
material of the other of said guard portions is

deposited during the molding process to provide a
locking engagement of the base portion (12,112) and

upper portion (18,118), one to the other.
An assembly according to any of the previous
claims, characterized in that said plurality of

upwardly projecting protrusions (22) comprise a
plurality of conical cross-section ribs extending

along the upper surface of said guard upper portion
(18,118) parallel to a blade edge and spaced one

from the other.
An assembly according to claim 1,
characterized in that said elongated guard member

(10) is rigidly mounted in said body structure
(24). 
An assembly according to any of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that said blade is resiliently

mounted in said body structure (24).
An assembly according to any of claims 1 to
10, characterized in that the bottom base portion

(12, 112) has an upwardly projecting surface
adjacent said body structure, said plurality of

protrusions (22) extending upwardly beyond said
bottom base portion upwardly projecting surface.
