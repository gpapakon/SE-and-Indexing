<ABSTRACT>
In a rotational/linear brushless DC motor/generator the rotor/slide (100) has many equally spaced permanent magnet poles (101) of alternating polarity and it has no or little magnetically permeable iron parts. These magnets (101) cover typically slightly more than half the pole pitch in trapezoidal embodiments. The stator consists of one or several pairs of two stator parts facing each other. Each stator part has a plurality of poles (111-126, 131-146) with the same pitch as the rotor/slide poles (101). The stator parts in a pair are arranged on each side of the rotor/slide (100) and are displaced 180 electrical degrees from each other. Each one of the two stator parts in a pair has windings for one phase in order to polarize the poles (111-126, 131-146) in the stator part in alternating polarity. The gaps between the stator poles (111-126, 131-146) facing the rotor/slide (100) in the same stator part are small compared to the pole pitch. In this way high torque/force DC motors/generators with low weight and high efficiency are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with two-phase or section wise twophase permanent 
magnetized, brushless DC motors and generators, rotating or linear. Most electric motors can equally well be used as a motor or as a generator. In the 
following the word motor is generally used even if all described embodiments equally well 
can be used as generators. Many electric motors or generators can be built either as rotating or linear machines 
with little changes. In the following it should be understood that even if some embodiments 
are described only for rotational or linear machines, the same principles can be applied for 
the other kind of electric machine. Thus for instance the words "slide" or "slider" and 
"rotor" may signify basically the same part. The market for brushless DC motors in the range of several Watts and higher is totally 
dominated by designs having stators where the windings of three phases are overlapping. 
This means that the area circumvented by a coil belonging to one phase do not only contain a 
flux carrying iron pole; it will also circumvent slots containing windings belonging to other 
phases. This gives a not very efficient use of pole iron mass and/or requires long copper 
windings. The market for brushless DC motors in the range of several Watts and higher is also 
totally dominated by designs having rotors where the permanent magnets are assembled on a 
magnetic flux permeable support structure (normally made of iron) that closes the flux path. 
This structure gives a high inertia or mass of the rotor. A typical prior art motor is disclosed in the international application PCT/DE86/00437. 
This motor has two stator parts and both stator parts carry windings of more than one phase. 
This means that the area circumvented by a coil belonging to one phase does not only contain a 
flux carrying iron pole; it will also circumvent slots containing windings belonging to other 
phases. This gives an inefficient use of the pole iron mass and requires long copper 
windings, that is this prior motor is heavy and has high copper losses. Furthermore, to use 
the multi-phase windings efficiently, the magnets must cover a large part of the 
circumference, thus giving rotors with a high moment of inertia. Motors where each stator is divided into two parts offer increased possibilities for 
simplified windings and thus for low cost motors. There are several prior art designs using a 
single coil winding concentric with the motor axis for each pase. However, they have severe 
limitations when used
