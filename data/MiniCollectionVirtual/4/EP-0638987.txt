<ABSTRACT>
The present multi-step changeover type series (or 
compound) field winding for shunt motor speed control 

circuit having transient storage effect relates to a series 
field winding having plural intermediate taps, series with a 

choke diode between with the power supply and parallel 
connnecting an energy storage diode, capacitor, etc., and a 

shunt switch device for carrier control is parallel 
connected between the power supply and each tap, when the 

controlled switch device is broken circuit, motor armature 
current will pass by the series field winding in full; when 

the switch device is conducted the power supply current will 
be shunted by the controlled switch device leading to the 

armature through the other series windings or directly, 
leading to the armature while the field is excited 

continuously with the storage element in order to advance 
armature voltage under much stable flux intensity depending 

on the ratio of conducting time to broken circuit cycle by 
the control of each shunt switch device and further to 

control the speed of motor. Some part of series winding may 
be parallel connected to the shunt switch device and the 

remainings maintain series with armature in order to meet a 
flexible requirement, or a plural series field winding taps 

matching a plural shunt switch device in order to select 
turn ratio of relatively controlled winding; in addition 

shunt ratio can be controlled with the feedback signal of 
current or running speed. The shunt switch device required 

by the present design may comprise matured thyristor or 
switch transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shunt-type motor speed
control circuit.Known motor speed control circuits are described in DE-A-2605561
and CH-A-445629. A shunt-type motor speed control
circuit according to the preamble of independent claims 1 is
disclosed in DE-A-2 605 561.The present invention provides a shunt-type motor speed
control circuit comprising a direct current motor armature;
a series field winding having first and second ends, the
second end being connected to the armature; a tap on the
series field windinq, a switch beinq connected between the
tap and the power supply terminal ;
and control means for
controlling the switch selectively to connect the tap to the
power supply terminal, and thereby change the effective turn
ratio of the series field winding; characterised by
a diode connected in
series between the power supply terminal and the first end
of the series field winding
and transient energy storage means connected in parallel with
the series field winding for enabling the series field
winding to maintain a stable excitation field during
switching of the switch.Advantageously, the series field winding has a plurality of
intermediate taps, the series field winding being connected
in series with a choke diode between a power supply and the
motor armature, and in parallel with an energy storage
element in the form of a diode or a capacitor. A shunt
switch device is connected in parallel between the power
supply and each tap, such that, when the switch device is
open, the motor armature current passes through the series
field winding; and, when the switch device is closed, the
power supply current is shunted by the switch device to the
armature through the associated tap, while the field is
excited continuously by the energy storage element in order
to increase the armature voltage with a much more stable
flux intensity depending on the ratio of on-to-off times 
according to which each shunt switch device is controlled,
and thereby provide improved control of the speed of the
motor.
A part of the series winding may be connected in parallel
with the shunt switch device, with the remaining part
maintained in series with the armature in order to provide
flexibility, permitting selection of the turn ratio of the
relatively controlled winding. In addition, the shunt ratio
of the motor can be controlled by feeding back a signal
representative of the armature current or running speed.
The shunt switch device required by the present design may
be a thyristor or a switch transistor.The
