A process for preparing pyruvic acid from
(D)-lactic acid using a biocatalyst, which comprises

transferring the electrons which are produced in the
oxidation of (D)-lactic acid to anthraquinonesulfonic

acid as mediator, and subsequently reoxidizing the
mediator by reaction with an electron acceptor, the

precursor concentration being from 0.01 to 0.7 M.
A process for preparing mixtures of pyruvic
acid and (L)-lactic acid from (D,L)-lactic acid using a

biocatalyst, which comprises transferring the electrons
which are produced in the oxidation of (D)-lactic acids

to anthraquinonesulfonic acid as mediator, and
subsequently reoxidizing the mediator by reaction with

an electron acceptor, the precursor concentration being
from 0.01 to 0.7 M.
