<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method for preparing wood composition board, such 
as hard board, fabricated consolidating fibers or chips under heat and pressure to form 

an integral board material. 
More particularly, this invention relates to an improved method for applying a 
clear or pigmented prepress coating, also known as a prepress sealer, to the surface of a 

fibrous mat by converting the prepress sealer into foam prior to subjecting the mat to a 
temperature and pressure press treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing wood composition board, such
as hardboard, fabricated by consolidating fibers or chips under heat and pressure to
form an integral board material.Wood composition board such as, for example, hardboard, is manufactured by
the reconsolidation of the de-fiberated wood chips under heat of up to 232Â°C (450
degrees F) and pressure up to about 82.64 bar (1,200 psi).The fibrous particles are first
formed into a unitary mat, by either a dry process or a wet process, which is then
consolidated into a solid board by applying heat and pressure. Prior to the
reconsolidation of the defiberated wood chips and before applying heat and pressure,
compositions containing synthetic items, such as polymeric dispersions, aminoplast
resins and waxes, may be applied to the mat surface to increase the strength, integrity
and enhanced water resistance. These compositions are referred to as "prepressed
sealers".The production of wood composition board prepared by a conventional process
for preparing such products typically employ a step where the prepress sealer has to be
applied to the composition board mat surface prior to the application of heat and
pressure. The prepress sealer is conventionally applied to the fiber mat surface by
spraying. This conventional spray method for transferring the prepress sealer to the
mat surface results in significant losses of the prepress sealer into exhaust systems and
air circulation systems.Another shortcoming of applying the prepress sealer by spraying is the tendency
to have an uneven distribution of prepress sealer on the board surface. This uneven
application of the prepress sealer may create spots or surface discoloration in the final
product, as well as increase the cost of production due to the inefficient transfer of the
prepress sealer onto the mat.US-A-3,607,341 discloses a process for producing foam coated textiles, and
similar materials are produced by (a) foaming an aqueous emulsion latex composition
containing about 1.5 to about 10 parts by weight of a water-soluble salt of a saturated
organic acid to increase the volume of said latex from about 4 to about 12 times its
original volume; (b) applying the thus obtained foam directly to said textile or similar
substrate; (c) partially drying the foam and substrate to a moisture content of less than
about 20 percent by weight while retaining the foam in its extended form during the 
drying process without gelation or curing the polymer; (d) crushing the partially dried
and uncured
