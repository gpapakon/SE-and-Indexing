<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum filling machine and method are provided for use in filling 
a porous 

pouch (38) with microporous powder. The machine has a housing (42) 
sealable in an air tight 

manner. A pair of substantially parallel plates (44,46) are positioned 
within said housing, one 

of the plates having a plurality of perforations (47) therethrough 
extending from facing front 

sides of that plate to back side of that plate. The housing is openable 
to receive the 

porous pouch between the facing front sides of the plates. A nozzle (56) 
provides a 

communication path between the pouch and a source of microporous powder. 
A 

vacuum source (52) communicates with an interior of the housing and the 
back side of the 

plate with perforations through a vacuum shroud. Preferably, a heat 
sealing device is 

positioned within the housing for sealing an edge of the pouch after 
filling with microporous powder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
making an insulating panel. Vacuum insulation panels are useful in a variety 
of environments, and in particular in conjunction with 
refrigeration apparatus in which they are utilized as 
insulating panels in the walls of refrigerators and 
freezers. Typically a vacuum insulation panel has some type 
of insulating material, generally powders or micro-porous 
sheets of insulating material which are placed into a non-porous 
bag and, after evacuation of all gases, the bag is 
sealed. Such panels and a method for fabricating them are 
disclosed in US Patent No. 5,018,328, assigned to Whirlpool 
Corporation, the assignee of the present application, the 
disclosure of said patent being incorporated herein by 
reference, as well as in US Patent Nos. 5,076,984 and 
4,683,702. The use of a gas permeable enclosure to contain 
the powder during evacuation is disclosed in the '984 and 
'702 patents listed above. According to the present invention we provide 
method of making an insulating panel, said method comprising 
the steps of locating a porous pouch in a housing which is 
sealable in an air tight manner; connecting a nozzle between 
said porous pouch and a source of micro-porous powder; 
applying a vacuum to the interior of the housing, thereby to 
draw said micro-porous powder into said porous pouch; 
clamping said panel between a pair of parallel plates within 
said housing, wherein at least one of said plates is 
provided with perforations, until said plates are a 
predetermined distance apart from each other to form a pouch 
of a desired thickness; placing the formed pouch into an 
impermeable barrier bag, within a vacuum chamber; and  
 
sealing the impermeable barrier bag. Such a method is a significant improvement over 
other presently known processes. In a preferred vacuum filling machine for carrying 
out the method of the invention a housing is sealable in an 
air tight manner. Within the housing are a pair of 
substantially parallel plates, one of the plates under a 
vacuum hood section having a plurality of perforations 
therethrough extending from a facing front side of that 
plate to a back side of that plate surface. The housing is 
openable to receive the porous pouch between the facing 
front sides of the plates. A nozzle arrangement is provided 
to establish a communication path between the pouch and the 
powder hopper where the powder is stored prior to filling of 
the pouches. Once the pouch has been sealed into the 
housing with the nozzle

<CLAIMS>
A method of making an insulating panel, said 
method comprising the steps of:- 


locating a porous pouch (38) in a housing (42) 
which is sealable in an air tight manner; 
connecting a nozzle (56) between said porous pouch 
(38) and a source of micro-porous powder (60); 
applying a vacuum to the interior of the housing, 
thereby to draw said micro-porous powder into said porous 

pouch (38); 
clamping said panel between a pair of parallel 
plates (44,46) within said housing, wherein at least one of 

said plates (44) is provided with perforations (47), until 
said plates are a predetermined distance apart from each 

other to form a pouch of a desired thickness; 
placing the formed pouch into an impermeable 
barrier bag (68), within a vacuum chamber; and 
sealing the impermeable barrier bag. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein said micro-porous 
powder is preheated and dried prior to being drawn 

into the pouch (38). 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
micro-porous powder in the pouch (38) is heated while in the 

housing (42). 
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the 
porous pouch (38) is provided by feeding two layers of 

permeable film into a heat sealing machine sandwiched 
between two PTFE cloth layers, whereby the two layers of 

film are melted and fused together and trimmed without being 
stuck to the PTFE cloth layers.  

 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein 
a vacuum is applied to the housing on the side of the 

perforated plate(s) (44) remote from said porous pouch. 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the amount of powder filled into the pouch is measured by a 

sensitive weight scale (59) on the lower of said pair of 
parallel plates. 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the impermeable barrier bag (68) consists of two 

compartments (88,90), which are fabricated simultaneously by 
heat sealing three layers of plastic barrier film 

simultaneously. 
A method according to claim 7, wherein said 
plastic barrier films include two vacuum metallized plastic 

films and one aluminium foil plastic laminate film. 
A method according to claim 7 or 8, wherein two 
porous pouches (38) are inserted, one into each of said 

compartments (88,90). 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein 
the vacuum chamber has a predetermined amount of low 

pressure helium (96) injected prior to sealing the 
impermeable barrier bag (68).
