<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a moulding machine with a transportation device for supplying an empty moulding (10) from one side and for discharging a finished moulding box (10c) at the opposite side and with a turntable (3), rotatable about a central column (2), for the stepwise transportation of the moulding boxes (10). In order to be able to integrate the moulding machine into a rectilinear transportation path and in order to be able to ensure fully automatic operation, the invention provides that the turntable (3) should be provided with four stations, on each of which is arranged a pattern plate (5) on which a moulding box (10) can be placed, and that each station should be transferable successively, by stepwise rotation through 90@, into a sand-filling station (A), into a precompaction station (B), into a compaction station (C) and into a pattern-changing station (D).

A moulding machine with a conveying device for supplying an empty moulding
box (10) and for removing a finished moulding box (10c), having a turntable (3)

rotatable around a central column (2), for the cyclic conveyance of pattern-plates
(5a) and moulding boxes (10), where the turntable (3) is provided with four

stations, a pattern-plate (5) being arranged on each one, upon which a moulding

box (10) can be mounted, and each station being transferable in succession, by
cyclic rotation around 90°, into a sand-filling station (A), into a pre-compaction

station (B), into a compacting station (C) and into a pattern-changing station (D),
characterised in that the empty moulding box (10) is delivered from one side and

the finished moulding box (10c) is removed at an opposite side, and in that a
horizontally reciprocally mounted spacing element (13) is arranged in the region

of the turntable (3), which spacing element (13) can be introduced into an
interspace between an empty moulding box (10) and the moulding box (10b)

located at the compacting station (C), and can be moved with the moulding
boxes (10, 10b).
A moulding machine according to claim 1, characterised in that the sand-filling
station (A) is provided with delivery means (11a) for delivering a moulding box

(10) onto a pattern plate (5a), with means (6) for mounting a filling frame (8a) on
the moulding box (10), and with means (1a) for raising the pattern-plate (5a), the

moulding box (10) and the filling frame (8a) underneath a sand-dosing device
(16).
A moulding machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the pre-compaction
station (B) is provided with means (22) for raising the pattern-plate

(5b), the moulding box (10d) and the filling frame (8c) underneath a ventilation
hood (19). 
A moulding machine according to claim 3, characterised in that the ventilation
hood (19) is formed to apply a gas pressure impact for pre-compaction.
A moulding machine according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the compacting station (C) is provided with means (1b) for raising the

pattern-plate (5c), the moulding box (10b) and the filling frame (8b) into a
compacting unit (17), and with means (6) for lifting the filling frame (8b).
A moulding machine according to any one of the claims 2 to 5, characterised in
that the means (6) for mounting and removing the filling frame (8) comprise a

swivel-frame (6) rotatable around the central column (2) by 180° at a time.
A moulding machine according to any one of the claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that the pattern-changing station (D) comprises means (21) for removing a

pattern-plate (5d) from the turntable (3).
A moulding machine according to any one of the claims 1 to 7, characterised in
that the means (1a, 1b, 21, 22) are each in the form of a lifting-table.
A moulding machine according to any one of the claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that roller track elements (11) for conveying the moulding boxes (10) are

arranged in the region of the moulding machine.
A moulding machine according to claim 9, characterised in that the roller track
elements (11) are supported so as to be laterally movable, for the selective

release of the moulding box (10).
A moulding machine according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the spacing element (13) has a length of two moulding boxes (10).
A moulding machine according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the spacing element (13) is supported in a central bearing element (14) 

arranged in the region of the central column (2), and in that the spacing element
(13) and/or the bearing element (14) thereof can be set into the conveying track

of the moulding boxes (10).
