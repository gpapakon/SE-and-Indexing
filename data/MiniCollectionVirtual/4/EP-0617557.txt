<ABSTRACT>
In order to achieve check and adjustment of 
electronic apparatus such as a VTR from a remote 

location, a tone dialer in a service company converts 
commands and data into tone signals for checking and 

adjusting a VTR in a user's house, which tone signals 
are transmitted by a telephone over a telephone line and 

input to a telephone in the user's house. The tone 
signals received by the user's telephone are converted 

into the commands and data by a gateway and input to the 
VTR.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system in
which a telephone line is used for checking an
electronic apparatus and performing repair, adjustment,
and the like thereof from a remote location.As a system controlling electronic apparatus
such as a VTR, there has been a one disclosed in the
gazette of EP 0,467,305, Al.This system is called LANC (Local Application
Control Bus System) and in this system electronic
apparatus such as a VTR, a single-unit video camera-recorder,
and a tuner is controlled by peripheral
equipment such as an edit controller and a remote
controller. The system, by setting an electronic
apparatus in a service mode, can detect a failure in the
electronic apparatus and adjust it. Below will be
described a checking and/or adjusting system for 
electronic apparatus using the LANC with reference to
FIG. 12 to FIG. 14.In a checking and/or adjusting system for
electronic apparatus shown in FIG. 12, reference numeral
1 denotes a VTR as an electronic apparatus to be checked
and adjusted, 12 denotes an adjusting apparatus for
making the check and adjustment, and 4 denotes a LANC
cable.The VTR 1 comprises a microcomputer 11, a signal
processor 12, an EEPROM 13, and an input/output
interface 14. The microcomputer 11 has a function to
execute system control of the VTR 1. The signal
processor 12 is a video signal processor, an audio
signal processor, a reception circuit, or the like. The
EEPROM 13 stores various data for controlling the signal
processor 12, such as white balance setting data, EVR
(electronic volume) setting data, receive frequency
setting data, and patch correction data of a ROM (not
shown) in the microcomputer 11. The input/output
interface 14 has a function to make data conversion from
serial data on the LANC cable 4 to parallel data of the
microcomputer 11 and vice versa.The adjusting apparatus 12 comprises a
microcomputer 121, keys 122, a display 123, and an 
input/output interface 124. The microcomputer 121 has a
function to execute system control of the adjusting
apparatus 12. The keys 122 are for inputting various
commands and data necessary for the check and
adjustment. The display 123 displays commands and data
input from the keys 122, responses from the VTR 1, and
the like. The input/output interface 124, similarly to
the input/output interface 14, has a function to make
data conversion from serial data on the LANC cable 4 to
parallel data of the microcomputer 121 and vice versa.FIG. 13 shows a data format used in the LANC.
