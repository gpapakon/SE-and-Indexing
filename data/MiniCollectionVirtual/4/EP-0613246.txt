<ABSTRACT>
A variable delay line (10) having a string of "slow" logic inverters (11) and an equal 
number of "fast" inverters (14) with inputs connected to corresponding "slow" 

inverter inputs. Transmission gates (15), coupling the "fast" inverter outputs to 
corresponding "slow" inverter outputs, vary the amount of coupling between the 

inverters. Maximum delay occurs with substantially no coupling between the "fast" 
and "slow" inverters and minimum delay occurs when maximum coupling occurs 

between the "fast" and "slow" inverters. The variable delay line may be configured 
into a variable frequency ring oscillator, useful in phase-locked-loops or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to variable delay lines. Delay lines are widely used in a variety of integrated circuit 
applications, such as delay-locked-loops and clock generators. The delay line is 
typically formed on an integrated circuit by cascading a string of logic inverters, 
each connection between the inverters serving as a "tap" along the delay line. One 
method of controlling the amount of delay through the line is by varying ("starving") 
the power supply current supplied to the inverters. Another way is by varying the 
amount of capacitance loading on the output of the inverters. A drawback to the above delay control approaches is the possible 
inability of the delay line delay to be as short as the technology used to implement 
the delay line allows. For example, the minimum delay for a current "starved" 
inverter based delay line may be significantly longer than if the inverters were not 
current limited. Further, at maximum delay, the signals propagating through the 
inverters may be so slow in rise and fall times that instabilities in circuits coupled to 
the delay line may occur. Connecting the input of an active delay line to its output forms a ring 
oscillator which are widely used in, for example, integrated circuit phase locked 
loops. The oscillators generally have an odd number of inverting delay stages 
(typically logic inverters) serially connected into a ring with the oscillation 
frequency being substantially determined by the inverter delays. The amount of 
delay by each inverter is controlled as discussed above. In correspondence with the 
variable delay line problems mentioned above, while the ring oscillator does allow 
for wide variations in oscillation frequency, the highest oscillation frequency may be 
considerably less than the maximum possible for the logic technology used to 
implement the oscillator. Further, the lowest frequency of oscillation may not have 
sufficient amplitude for circuits utilizing the output of the oscillator and the 
oscillator may completely stop oscillation due to the gain of the inverters being 
insufficient to support oscillation. Still further, the relationship between the control 
signal and the oscillation frequency may be very non-linear.  
 Thus, it is desirable to provide a variable delay line design having wide 
delay range without having too slow logic rise and fall times at the longest desired 
delays and having shorter minimum delays than prior art designs. Further, it is 
desirable to provide a ring oscillator design that has wide
