<ABSTRACT>
Sprayable concrete is the main constituent of the new Austrian tunnel building method. In its conventional composition, sprayable concrete has a number of environmentally damaging properties. The patent describes the preparation of a special binder which allows production of sprayable concrete without pollutant-containing setting accelerators and the associated process technology. The properties of the binder greatly decrease the rebound. The mixture of the binder with the naturally moist aggregate requires a particular mixing method.

<CLAIMS>
A binder for preparing gunned concrete, from:

a) 60 to 95% by wt. of a ground cement clinker,
b) 
>
 0 to 2,5% by wt. of a sulfate component,
c) 0,3 to 8,0 % by wt. of a water-binding component,
d) 
>
 0 to 10,0% by wt. of a component reducing the
rebound of gunned concrete.
The binder according to claim 1, wherein

a) the cement clinker contains 40 to 65% by wt. of C
3
S,
20 to 45% by wt. of C
2
S, 1 to 22% by wt. of C
3
A and
0 to 12% by wt. C
4
AF, and/or
b) the sulfate component consists of anhydrite,
hemihydrate, gypsum, anhydrous aluminium sulfate

and/or anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and/or
c) the water-binding component consists of burnt
calcium oxide, anhydrous aluminium sulfate and/or a

silicium compound, and/or
d) the component reducing the rebound consists of an
amorphous powder of silicic acid of synthetic or

natural origin, burnt or foamed natural glass material
having a SiO

 content of 
>
55% by wt., fine flue ash,
SiO
2
-enriched flue ash, clay, clay-like products and/or
finely ground limestone powder.
The binder according to claim 1, containing
additionally a liquifying agent. 
A method for preparing a gunned concrete, wherein a
binder according to any of claims 1 to 3 is mixed with

wet aggregates in a mixing apparatus and homogenized,
and, immediately thereafter, the obtained mixture is

conveyed to a spray nozzle, with the aid of a conveyor,
from which the gunned concrete is applied to the surface

to be treated, the water necessary for setting and
hardening being added to the mixture behind the mixing

apparatus but in front or at the spray nozzle.
The method according to claim 4, wherein the mixture of
binder and aggregates is conveyed to the spray nozzle

by means of a dry spraying apparatus.
