<ABSTRACT>
A retaining flange (5), on its underside inside a fuel chamber (2) is detachably connected to a coupling element (7). A flexible hose (8), leading to a jet pump (9) and a hold-down device (10) for holding the jet pump (9) down on the base of the fuel chamber (2) are fixed to the said coupling element (7). For assembly and dismantling the coupling element (7) can be separated from the retaining flange (5) with the components fixed to it.

<CLAIMS>
Jet pump unit, which has a jet pump which is 
connected by means of a flexible hose to a securing 

flange which can be inserted into an opening of a fuel 
tank, the said jet pump being pretensioned away from the 

securing flange by means of a securing element which is 
also attached to the securing flange, characterized by a 

coupling component (7) which is detachably connected to 
the securing flange (5) and to which the retaining 

element (10) and the hose (8) are attached. 
Jet pump unit according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the coupling part (7) has, one next to the other, 

two plug-in parts (14, 15) which can be inserted into 
corresponding receptacles (12, 13) of the securing flange 

(5), the first plug-in part (14) of which is constructed 
as a tubular element for connecting the jet pump (9) to 

a fuel connection of the securing flange (5) and the 
second plug-in part (15) is constructed as an anti-rotation 

element. 
Jet pump unit according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that a non-return valve (16) which opens in the 

direction of the jet pump (9) is arranged in the first 
plug-in part (14) or the receptacle (12) for the first 

plug-in part (14).
