<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a delivery device, 
especially for colours and paints, of the kind 

comprising a plurality of nozzles (1) or delivery ducts, 
said ducts being each connected to their own tank and 

arranged in such a way as to discharge into a single 
chamber (3) which is directed into an underlying container, 

characterized in that around the discharge nozzles a 
sealed chamber (4) with removable bottom is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a delivery device, 
especially for colours and paints. From Italian patent 1.101.064 and Italian patent 
0.215.555, of the same applicant, delivery devices for 
the same application are known. Said delivery devices comprise a plurality of nozzles, 
which are usually radially arranged, said nozzles being 
each connected to their own colour tank. The colour delivered from the nozzles falls into an 
underlying container, which is typically a can. When a colour flow is interrupted, in the nozzle or 
delivery duct there will almost always remain a certain 
amount of said colour. The liquid phase of the colour is prone to evaporate as 
it is in contact with the atmosphere, thereby causing 
the colour to dry up and the delivery duct to clog. The currently known delivery devices, especially for 
colours and paints, require consequently frequent 
troublesome maintenance operations. The specific object of the present invention is to 
overcome the above-mentioned draw-backs and find a 
delivery device, especially for colours and paints, 
which allows the colour remaining in the delivery ducts  
 
during a flow interruption phases to remain unaltered. A further object of the present invention is to provide 
a delivery device of a simple, low-cost construction. The above and other objects are achieved in a delivery 
device, especially for colours and paints, of the kind 
comprising a plurality of nozzles, or delivery ducts, 
characterized in that it comprises, around the discharge 
nozzles, a tight-sealed chamber with removable bottom. Further features and advantages of the invention will be 
more clearly understood from the description of a 
preferred, but not exclusive, embodiment of the delivery 
device, especially for colours and paints, which is 
illustratively shown in the accompanying drawing, in 
which figure 1 is a side elevation view, partly in 
section, of the device in stand-by condition, which 
embodiment must not be construed as limiting. With reference to the sole figure, the device comprises 
a plurality of discharge nozzles, or ducts, 1 for 
delivering the colour that is contained within tanks 2. Said nozzles are radially arranged and discharge into a 
tight-sealed chamber 3 which is closed in the lower part 
by a removable bottom 4 and in the upper part by a cover 
5, said cover 5 being located over the array of nozzles 
1. The side wall of the chamber consists of a flange 7  
 
which is located under the array of nozzles 1, and a 
gasket 6, said gasket comprising

<CLAIMS>
A delivery device, especially for colours and paints, 
comprising a plurality of nozzles or 

delivery ducts (1), said ducts or nozzles being each connected to their 
own tank (2) and arranged in such a way as to discharge into 

a single chamber (3) which is directed into an underlying 
container, characterized in that around the discharge 

nozzles or ducts a tight-sealed chamber (3) with removable bottom (4) is 
provided. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
within said tight-sealed chamber (3) a certain amount of 

liquid is provided which upon evaporation produces an 
equilibrium with the vapour pressure of the same liquid 

present in the colour. 
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that 
on the inner side of said removable bottom part of said 

tight-sealed chamber a cavity (15) is provided containing a 
sponge (16) which is soaked in the liquid that is used to 

control the atmosphere of the tight-sealed chamber. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
said tight-sealed chamber (3) comprises: 


a cover (5) located over the array of nozzles; 
a flange (7) located under the array of nozzles; 
a gasket (6) consisting of two superposed parts and  
 

radially crossed by the array of nozzles, said gasket 
being constrained between the cover and flange, so as to 

tighten, under the deformation, the array of nozzles; 
a plurality of screws (8) for tightening the cover to the 
flange. 
A device as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that 
on at least two screws elastic means are present, said 

elastic means (9) tending to raise the cover removing it 
from the plane on which the flange rests. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the removable bottom part (4) of the tight-sealed chamber is 

controlled by a kinematic motion system (21), said kinematic 
motion system (21) comprising: 


a linear actuator (20), said linear actuator possibly 
pivoting around an axis that is perpendicular to the 

translation direction of said linear actuator and 
perpendicular to the weight direction of said linear 

actuator; 
a wedge (27) on the upper surface (28) of which a stopper (4) is 
fixed, said wedge being directly connected to said 

linear actuator; 
fixed abutment means on which said wedge moves. 
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
said fixed abutment means on which the wedge is moved 

comprise:  
 


a sphere (29) on which said wedge slides. 
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
elastic means (31) are provided for setting the pressure the 

stopper applies to the flange of the tight-sealed 
chamber. 
A device as claimed in claim 7 and 8, characterized 
in that said elastic means for setting the pressure the 

stopper applies against the flange consist of a spring 
that biases said sphere against the lower surface (26) of 

the wedge. 
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterized in 
that said linear actuator is an air piston. 
A machine for the delivery of paints or colours, 
comprising a delivery device as claimed in the preceding 

claims.
