low density polyethylene phase, and one or more discontinuous 

phase polymers, dispersed through the dominant continuous 
phase in the form of domains. The indicated discontinuous 

phases polymers are chosen from among polypropylene and

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medical fabrics which
are gamma radiation resistant, and to multiconstituent fibers
for the preparation of such fabrics.An objective, in the nonwoven fabrics industry, is to
produce such fabrics relatively inexpensively, while also
satisfying one or more particular criteria. The nonwoven
fabrics, such as those prepared by card and bond or
spunbonding processes, in particular represent an economical
class of fabrics, for the medical and related fields.Polypropylene fibers are conventionally used for
preparing nonwoven fabrics, such as by the foregoing
processes, due to the ability of polypropylene to thermally
bond over a broad temperature range, and because polypropylene
fiber can be carded into light webs at high speeds. However,
exposure to gamma radiation causes considerable mechanical
property deterioration to polypropylene; not only is such 
deterioration effected upon an exposure, but the deterioration
from that exposure even continues, over the course of time.Gamma radiation treatment is a preferred method of
sterilization in the medical and related fields, and is
customarily used for all manner of medical fabrics and
materials, including surgical and protective items. For this
reason, polypropylene is disadvantageous for medical and
related applications.Like polypropylene, polyethylene is also a relatively
inexpensive polyolefin. Polyethylenes have yet additional
advantages, as set forth below.For instance, in contrast to the polypropylenes, as
discussed above, polyethylenes generally do not undergo
extensive deterioration upon exposure to the dosages of gamma
radiation which are employed for sterilizing medical items.
Polyethylene fabrics have other favorable attributes,
including soft hand, good drape, and heat sealability to
polyethylene films; yet additionally, polyethylene is also
widely recognized for its relative chemical inertness,
especially its resistance to acidic or alkaline conditions, in
comparison with polyester or nylon fibers.However, melt spun polyethylene is rarely considered as
a thermal bonding fiber, because it lacks the strong bonding 
property generally attainable with polypropylene fiber, and
because of its lower fiber tensile strength. Polyethylene
forms fibers which are slick, and of low modulus - generally,
lower modulus than that of other types of staple fiber.Foremost among the difficulties normally encountered, in
the production of thermally bonded polyethylene fabrics are
the problems associated with carding the fibers - by virtue
