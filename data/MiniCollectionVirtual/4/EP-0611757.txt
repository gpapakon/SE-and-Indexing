formula I



wherein X means hydrogen, is reacted with a compound
of the general formula II,



wherein Y means hydrogen, to yield the compound
according to claim 1.
Process for the production of azaphenothiazines of the
general formula IV, 



wherein X may mean hydrogen, alkyl groups having a
chain length of 1-6 carbon atoms, which may be

substituted by one or more halogen atoms, or carboxy
having 1-5 carbon atoms and wherein the stated groups

may occur once or repeatedly in positions 4, 5 or 6 of
the 2-chloropyridine parent substance, and wherein Y

may mean hydrogen, alkyl groups having a chain length
of 1-6 carbon atoms, which may be substituted by one

or more halogen atoms, halogens, alkoxy having 1-5
carbon atoms or carboxy having 1-5 carbon atoms and

wherein the stated groups may occur once or repeatedly
in positions 4, 5 or 6 of the 2-mercaptoaniline parent

substance, characterised in that compounds of the
general formula



wherein X has the stated meaning,

are reacted with compounds of the general formula II
