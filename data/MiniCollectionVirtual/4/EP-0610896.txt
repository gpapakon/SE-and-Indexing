<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel and useful 
quinolonecarboxylic acid derivative, a method of preparation 
and use thereof. More specifically, the invention relates 
to: such a quinolonecarboxylic acid derivative as can be 
obtained by a reaction between (i) a quinolonecarboxylic 
acid derivative having a piperazinyl or pyrrolidinyl group 
at position 7 of the quinolone ring and (ii) a position 4-substituted 
benzenesulfonyl halide, a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt thereof, a method of preparation of such a 
derivative and salt, and an antibacterial pharmaceutical 
composition containing such a derivative or salt. Since the development of norfloxacin, a wide variety of 
new quinolone synthetic antibacterials have been newly 
synthesized and developed. They include, for example, 
ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, 
tosufloxacin, etc. Upon this background, the inventors have investigated 
in a search for a novel quinolonecarboxylic acid derivative 
having a potent antibacterial activity. The inventor have 
then come to found such an activity in a class of novel 
quinolonecarboxylic acid derivatives which were obtained by 
a reaction between (i) a quinolonecarboxylic acid derivative  
 
having a piperazinyl or pyrrolidinyl group at position 7 of 
the quinolone ring and (ii) a position 4-substituted 
benzenesulfonyl halide. The present invention has been made 
on the basis of this finding. The invention, therefore, provides a compound of the 
formula I: 
wherein R₁ is hydrogen, halogen or lower alkoxy,
 
R₂ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, -NH₂, -NHCOCH₃ or 
halogen,
 
R₃ is lower alkyl, and
 
Z is a group represented by the formula II or III: 
   wherein R₄ and R₅, identical or different, are hydrogen  
 
or lower alkyl, or
 
a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The compounds of the formula I, a quinolonecarboxylic 
acid derivative, exhibits a potent antibacterial activity 
against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The invention also provides a method of preparation of 
such a derivative or salt, and, additionally, a useful 
antibacterial pharmaceutical composition containing such a 
derivative or salt (the derivative and salt are hereinafter 
referred to as "the present compounds"). Accordingly, in another aspect, the invention discloses 
the use of the present compound for the manufacture of a 
pharmaceutical composition for treatment of diseases caused 
by bacterial infection of mammals including human. The invention still further provides a method
