<ABSTRACT>
Energy and data signals are intended to be transmitted simultaneously via a two-wire bus (1), to which bus subscribers (2) are connected. The current-carrying capacity is restricted on the basis of the voltage drop on the bus line. According to the invention, energy for the connected bus subscribers (2) is additionally fed in at a plurality of points along the two-wire bus (1) via coupling components (3). The coupling components (3) electrically isolate individual bus segments (20) from one another and simultaneously enable the transmission of data signals to all bus subscribers (2). Capacitors (4, 5), which transmit the data signals without obstruction but which present a barrier to DC current, are used for this purpose in the coupling components (3) along the line of the two-wire bus (1). Inductors (6, 7), which block the data signals but allow the DC current to pass through, are disposed in the connection lines of a DC voltage source (14).
