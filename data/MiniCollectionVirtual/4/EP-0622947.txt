<ABSTRACT>
An image printer includes a controller for 
controlling image printer operations, an image 

storing device for storing image data, an image 
printer including a print head for printing image 

data stored in the image storing device and a print 
position setter for setting a print position of the 

image printing means. The controller provides 
current position data to the print position setter, 

and the left print position is set in accordance 
with a current position of the print head of the 

image printer. A right position is set by adding a 
horizontal printing width of the stored image to the 

left print position. Alternatively, the controller 
provides current position data to the print position 

setter, and the right print position of the stored 
image is set to a current position of the print head 

of the image printer and a left position is set by 
subtracting a horizontal printing width of the 

stored image from the right print position. In 
either case, the print head is moved to the set 

positions and the operator is provided with the 
opportunity to alter the positions if the positions 

are deemed unacceptable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
printing method and printing apparatus for
accurately positioning an image on a recording
medium by determining end positions of an image with
respect to the recording medium. More particularly,
the present invention relates to an image printer
such as a type used in an electronic word processor
which accurately positions an image to be printed
onto a recording medium by determining the image
size with respect to the recording medium size, and
performs a locating operation of a left end and a
locating operation of a right end of the image with
respect to the recording medium prior to a print
operation. Precise positioning of printed images such
as illustrations and logos is desirable so that the
overall impression made by those images, such as on
Christmas cards and labels, is pleasing. But
conventional printing systems which utilize on-line
printers such as dot matrix or ink jet printers are
ill-equipped to position an image to be printed onto
a recording medium because preset coordinates of a
printer do not allow for precise positioning of
images or text onto the recording medium. Thus,
conventional printing systems do not allow for
precise image positioning.Recently, however, word processing systems
have been developed in which an operator utilizing
the word processing system can designate image
coordinates based on a computer-generated display of
a recording medium with an overlayed image to be
printed. That is, an image to be printed can be
overlaid on an image of a recording medium to
determine the correct positioning of the image. The
operator performs this operation by utilizing a
pointing device such as a cursor or a mouse to
manipulate an image onto a displayed recording
medium.In spite of these developments, the
displayed images are not accurately positioned since
coordinate data of the display frequently deviates
from the actual print position of a printing head
with respect to the recording medium. Thus, precise
positioning of an image onto a recording medium of a
similar size is still not easily performed.Other solutions to resolve inaccurate
positioning of an image or text on a recording
medium are time-consuming and costly. For example,
it has been considered to provide visual
confirmation of a printing position on a recording 
medium by physical manipulation of the printing head for
each designated point of an image within the recording
medium, or to provide an operator determination of a size
of the image and that of the recording medium by
performing

A method of controlling an image printing apparatus
having a print head so as to position an image onto a

recording medium, comprising the steps of:

determining (S302) the size of an image to be
printed;
designating (S304-S306) a first end position of the
image with respect to the recording medium; and
designating (S307-S309) a second end position by
shifting the first end position in accordance with the

size of the image,

   characterised by:

confirming (S303-304, S306-307) the first end
position and the second end position by a user input

prior to printing, said confirming step including
displaying to the user said first end position with

respect to the recording medium, moving the print head
to the first end position and, in response to a user

confirmation, storing coordinates of the first end
position in a memory, displaying to the user the second

end position with respect to the recording medium, and
moving the print head to the second end position and, in

response to a user confirmation, storing coordinates of
the second end position in the memory.
A method for positioning an image on to a recording
medium in accordance with claim 1, wherein the size of 

the image to be printed is determined with respect to the
size of the recording medium.
A method for positioning an image onto a recording
medium in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the

second end position is designated after the first end
position has been confirmed.
A method for positioning an image onto a recording
medium in accordance with any preceding claim, wherein

in the case that the displayed first end position is not
acceptable, said method further comprises the steps of:


re-designating a first end position;
