<ABSTRACT>
A one-way degassing valve (4) for aromatic products, such as coffee and the like, 
comprising a valve body (5,6), a valve element (12) and a selective type filter (17, 170), 

preferably consisting of activated charcoal which allows the passage of low molecular 
weight gases, such as carbon dioxide, and retains the high molecular weight gases that 

constitute the product's aroma.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a valve for aromatic products, or products that develop
fragrant gases, particularly powder-like products such as coffee and the like, packaged
in air-tight containers. Specific reference will be made hereafter to coffee, it being
understood that what is said applies in general to all those products that develop fragrant
gases.Valves of the above mentioned type are obviously already known and are commonly
called degassing valves. They are one-way valves that are normally applied to the upper
wall of the container and whose purpose is to allow the gases developed by the coffee to
escape from the container - thus avoiding the possible build-up of internal overpressures
which would cause swelling and/or breakage of the container itself - and at the same
time to prevent air from entering the container as this would impair the quality of the
product.The one-way valves used at present serve this purpose perfectly, opening when slight
internal overpressures occur and closing immediately when they cease.However, these valves present great drawbacks due to the following considerations.Fresh (newly packaged) coffee generates a mixture of gases inside the container,
consisting mainly of carbon dioxide and, in a smaller percentage, of so-called aromas,
which are characterised by complex molecular chains and thus high molecular weight.The one-way valves currently used employ porous filters, whose sole purpose is to
prevent the escape of coffee grains. In the event of overpressure inside the container,
therefore, they allow both carbon dioxide and the product's aromas to escape through
the valve.A valve of such type is known, e.g. from FR-A-2 593 264, according to which the
preamble of appended claim 1 has been drafted. EP-A-0 296 437 refers to a degassing closure for containers for extremely pure
liquids, such as those used for treatment of semiconductors. Such closure
comprises a charcoal filter packed between lower and upper plates which avoid
possible contact between the liquid of the container and the particles of the
adsorbing means of the filter. The aim of the invention is to avoid the above drawback and to preserve the aroma of
the product virtually intact, preventing any escape of the aromas, i.e. of gaseous
components with a long molecular chain. This aim is achieved, according to claim 1 of the invention, by providing a degassing valve
equipped with a selective filter, that allows the passage of molecules of carbon dioxide
and any other gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen and

<CLAIMS>
A degassing valve for aromatic products, comprising a valve body (5, 6), a

mobile
 valve element (12) of the one-way type 
positioned on the valve body (5,6)
,

and
 a filter (17, 170) 
engaging said valve body and faced to the product,
 suitable for
preventing the passage of product grains, characterised in that said filter (17, 170) is of

the selective type, allowing the passage of gases with simple molecules, such as carbon
dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen and methane and retaining gases that have complex molecular

chains, and are therefore heavier, which constitute the product's aromas 
and which fall
back inside the container
. 
A valve according to claim 1, characterised in that said selective filter is a
porous molecular sieve.
A valve according to claim 1, characterised in that said filter comprises
activated charcoal (21), possibly mixed with other acid and/or basic substances.
A valve according to claim 3, characterised in that said activated charcoal (21)
is of the natural or vegetable type.
A valve according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that said active charcoal
(21) is contained between two opposite layers of porous paper (19, 20).
A valve according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that said activated charcoal
is mixed with excipients, such as water and sugar, and spread in one or more layers (172)

on a sheet of porous paper (171).
A valve according to any one of the previous claims, characterised in that said
filter (17, 170) is contained in a housing (16) created in said valve body (5).
A valve according to claim 1, in which said valve body comprises a base plate
(5) housing said filter (17, 170) and a contrasting cap (6) provided with respective holes

(11, 15), and said valve element (12) is a rubber diaphragm normally pressed against the
plate (5) so as to close said holes (11). 
A degassing valve according to any one of the previous claims, characterised
in that it is applied to a wall of a container (1) for aromatic products, such as coffee and

similar products that give off odours.
A valve according to claim 9, characterised in that it is applied to a peel-off
sheet (2) that closes the container (1).
An air-tight container for products that develop fragrant gases, such as coffee
and the like, equipped with a one-way degassing valve (4) provided with a selective

filter, that prevents the escape of aromas or odours.
