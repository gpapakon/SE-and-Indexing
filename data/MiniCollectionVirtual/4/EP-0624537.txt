<ABSTRACT>
The device for collecting a predetermined number of sheets, in particular paper sheets or the like, operates in such a way that the collected sheets are taken from a pile or from a continuous web at a station I and are transferred to a station II located below station I. This takes place with the aid of two flaps (12) which are arranged at the exit of station I and can be pivoted simultaneously about axes lying in a common horizontal plane from a horizontal collection position into a transfer position directed vertically downwards. From the transfer position they can then be pivoted back into the collection position. These flaps, which are of lightweight design, constitute a simple means for reliably collecting and rapidly transferring piles of sheets of any height.

Apparatus for collecting a predetermined number of blanks, particularly 
paper sheets or the like, from a stack or a continuous belt at a station I 

and the transfer thereof to a station II located below station I and at 
the outlet of station I there are two flaps (12) for collecting the blanks 

(15) and are pivotable about axes located in a common, horizontal plane 
from a horizontal collecting position into a vertically downwardly directed 

transfer position and into the horizontal collecting position, characterized 
in that the pivoting movement of the flaps (12) takes place by electric 

rotary magnets (14), whose rotating armatures perform between two 
internal stops an angle-limited rotary movement and simultaneously pivot 

the flaps back in the opposition direction into the horizontal collecting 
position. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that the pivoting 
movements of the rotary magnets (14) into the transfer position are assisted 

by a spring. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that each flap 
(12) is adjustable for adapting to the different blank formats.
