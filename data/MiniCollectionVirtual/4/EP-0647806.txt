<ABSTRACT>
The diaphragm (4) of a valve is fixed on a pressure spindle (7) by means of a bolt (9) which is anchored in the diaphragm (4) and which is screwed into a threaded sleeve (12). The connection between the threaded sleeve (12) and the pressure spindle (7) is formed by a pin (14) which is mounted in holes (15) in the pressure spindle (7). The play (18) between the pin (14) and the hole (15) relieves the pin (14) and the anchoring of the bolt (9) in the diaphragm (4) of the closing force.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for securing a diaphragm (4) of a 
valve, wherein a bolt (9) anchored in the diaphragm (4) 

is connected to a pressure spindle (7) and arranged 
between the pressure spindle (7) and the diaphragm (4) 

is a pressure piece (16), characterised in that an 
axially movable threaded sleeve (12) is retained by 

means of a pin (14) in the pressure spindle (7) and the 
rod (9) having a thread (10) is screwed into the 

threaded sleeve (12). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the pin (14) constructed as a slotted pin is 

fixedly connected to the threaded sleeve (12), and the 
pin (14) is mounted in bores (15) of the pressure 

spindle (7) which are greater in diameter than the 
diameter of the pin (14). 
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the bores (15) in the pressure 

spindle (7), are in diameter 3 to 6 mm, preferably 
4 mm, larger than the diameter of the pin (14).
