<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for and method of attenuating wheel speed variation during 
periods of brake intervention traction control is provided. The speed of 

the or each driven wheel is monitored and the braking force applied to 
the or each driven wheel is controlled in accordance with the wheel 

speed and wheel acceleration. Braking force may be increased when a 
rate of change of wheel acceleration is increasing and the wheel is 

accelerating i.e. between periods B and C of Figure 5c; whereas braking 
force may be decreased when the rate of change of wheel acceleration is 

decreasing and the wheel is decelerating, i.e. between periods D and E 
of Figure 5c.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for and method of control of
resonance in a brake intervention traction control system.Brake intervention traction control is concerned primarily with providing a
transfer of torque between driven wheels through a differential by braking
the slipping wheel. Such a traction control (TC) system may be
implemented in association with an anti-lock brake system (ABS). A
schematic representation of the brake arrangement of a combined brake
intervention traction control and anti-lock brake system is shown in Figure
1 of the accompanying drawings, the system is only illustrated in respect
of one wheel for clarity. The system comprises a master cylinder 2
arranged to supply fluid, in response to depression of a driver operated
brake pedal 3, to a brake 4 of a wheel 5 via a flow control valve 6 and a
first electrically operable solenoid valve 8. A series combination of a
second electrically operable solenoid valve 10 and a pump 12 are
connected in parallel with the flow control valve 6. The pump 12 is
arranged to pump fluid towards the junction of the flow control valve and
the first solenoid valve 8. A fluid reservoir 14 is connected to an inlet of
the pump 12 via a third electrically operable solenoid valve 16.During ABS operation the first valve 8 is open and the third valve 16 is
closed. Pressure from the master cylinder 2 is applied to the brake 4 via
the flow control valve 6. When the wheel 5 starts to skid, the second
solenoid valve 10 is operated to allow a decrease in brake fluid pressure 
at the brake 4, thereby reducing the braking force applied to the wheel 5
and halting the skid. The brake fluid is pumped back to the master
cylinder 2 to maintain the fluid volume in the master cylinder (otherwise
the brake pedal 3 would sink to the floor). When the wheel 5 has stopped
skidding, the second solenoid valve 10 is closed to allow fluid pressure to
be reapplied to the brake 4.During traction control operation, when one or more wheels start to spin
under acceleration, the first valve 8 is closed and the third valve 16 is
opened. The pump 12 is run so as to apply brake pressure to the brake 4
so as to reduce the drive torque applied through the spinning wheel 5.
The fluid pressure is modulated by pulsing the second solenoid valve 10
so as to control the braking force applied by the brake 4. The action of a
differential gear (not shown) provided to supply drive to wheels on
opposite sides of a vehicle but on a common axle, provides a transfer of
torque from the
