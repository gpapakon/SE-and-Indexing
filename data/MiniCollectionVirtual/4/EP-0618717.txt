<ABSTRACT>
An image processing apparatus for performing 
predetermined processing on an image of a document having 

an image portion and a background portion other than 
the image portion, has a function (101) for reading the 

image of the document so as to convert the image to an 
image signal composed of black and white pixels, a function 

(104, 105) for forming an expansion image by converting 
a white pixel array to a black pixel portion 

when the white pixel array corresponding to a predetermined 
number of pixels is continuous adjacent to the 

black pixel portion of the image signal received from 
the reading function, and a function (106, 107, 108) for 

recognizing that portion corresponding to the white 
pixel portion in the document image containing the 

expansion image formed by the expansion image forming 
function, as the background portion of the document.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image field
distinguishing apparatus for distinguishing
character/line portions from gradation portions by reading
a character/line/gradation-mixed image from a document
by means of a scanner, etc.In recent years, apparatuses, such as a facsimile
equipment, document file, digital copying machine, etc.,
have increasingly been found available to handle a
document image in the form of a digital signal. By
handling images as digital signals, many advantages can
be obtained, such as various edit/correction processing,
and electronic recording and transmission. Such a digital
image processing apparatus has conventionally been
used to mainly handle a black/white binary image, such
as characters/lines. A growing demand has recently been
made for an apparatus capable of handling a gradation-mixed
image.Recording an image in the form of a hard copy
poses a problem from the standpoint of handling a
character/line/gradation-mixed image. As a recording
method for obtaining a hard copy, use has often been
made of a melt thermal transfer system and electrophotographic
system. These recording systems have a
mere capacity to represent a density of two or nearly
several levels per recording image spot. For this
reason, the technique, such as an area modulation 
method, is employed to represent a gradation image. The
area modulation method is used to represent a gradation
portion by combining together a plurality of image
spots. Typically, a systematic dithering method, etc.,
is known in the art.The systematic dithering method is theoretically a
recording method for achieving a compatibility between
the image resolution and the gradation portion.
However, this method has the drawbacks in that
characters/lines are feebly reproduced at their edges
through a document reading system and that moire noise,
etc., is produced in a dot pattern document. The
character/line information is very important for the
document image and, further, a dot pattern printing is
often used to represent a gradation image or portion as
in the document image. Therefore, these drawbacks are
fatal to the document image.The image field distinguishing processing is known
to eliminate these drawbacks and to effect image
recording in a manner to achieve the image
resolution/gradation compatibility. This is the technique
for distinguishing a recording image into, for
example, a character/line preference portion and a gradation
preference portion such as a photo image and dot
pattern and performing recording processing
