Artificial joint for the replacement, in particular, of 
human joints, comprising at least two joint parts (21, 22) with 

spherical functional surfaces which move relative to each other, 
the relationships of the curvature relative to each other of the 

functional surfaces (23, 24) which have a circular sectional 
contour being convex-convex, convex-concave or concave-concave 

and the joint geometry being determined by a linkage with two 
joint axes running through the centres of rotation M
1
 and M
2
 of 
the functional surfaces with the radii R
1
 and R
2
, where R
1
 is the 
radius of the circular sectional contour of the functional 

surface with the centre point M
1
 and R
2
 is the radius of the 
circular sectional contour of the functional surface with the 

centre point M
2
, and a compression distribution element (25) 
being arranged between the two functional surfaces (23, 24) of 

the joint parts (21, 22), the sliding surfaces (26, 27), bearing 
against the functional surfaces, of which compression 

distribution element have a curvature adapted to the functional 
surfaces, characterised in that the sliding surfaces (26, 27) of 

the compression distribution element (25) are of the same size, 
or in that there is a difference between the surface sizes of the 

two sliding surfaces (26, 27) of the compression distribution 
element (25) of at most 5 - 10 %. 
Joint according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
sliding surfaces (26, 27) are highly polished. 
Joint according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
functional surfaces (23, 24) of the joint parts (21, 22) are 

convexly shaped and their centres of rotation M
1
 and M
2
 lie in 
the associated joint parts (21, 22) and the path of their joint 

axes has a radius 
R = R
1
 + R
2
 + D
. 
Joint according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
respectively one functional surface (24) of one joint part (22) 

is convexly shaped and the other functional surface (23) of the  
 

joint part (21) is concavely shaped and their centres of rotation 
M
1
 and M
2
 lie inside the joint part with the convex functional 
surface and the path of their joint axes has a radius 
R = R
2
 - 
R
1
 - D
, where R
2
 is greater than the sum of R
1
 and D, thereby 
ensuring a stable, overlapping, dimerous linkage. 
Joint according to Claim 2, characterised in that the two 
functional surfaces are concavely shaped and their centres of 

rotation M
1
 and M
2
 lie in the compression distribution element 
and the path of their joint axes has the radium 
R = R
2
 + R
1
 - D
. 
Joint according to Claim 2, characterised in that one 
functional surface of one joint part is convexly shaped and the 

other functional surface (23) of the joint part is concavely 
shaped and the cen
tre of rotation M
2
 of the joint part with the 
convex functional surface lies in this joint part and the centre 

of rotation M
1
 of the joint part with the concave functional 
surface lies in the compression distribution element and the path 

of their joint axes has a radius 
R = R
2
 - R
1
 + D
. 
Joint according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
minimum thickness D of the compression distribution element (25) 

is less than or equal to 50% of the smaller radius R
1
.
