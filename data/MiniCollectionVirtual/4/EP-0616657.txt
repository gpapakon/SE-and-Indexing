<ABSTRACT>
Control consoles are normally utilized to provide ready access to the operator of the controls necessary to perfom the various operating functions of the vehicle. Since vehicles, such as construction vehicles, are traversing rough terrain, it is advantageous to stabilize mouvement of the hand of the operator relative to the controls of the vehicle. In this subject arrangement a control console assembly (66) is provided and has a handrest (76) located thereon. The handrest (76) is adapted to receive the hand of the operator such that the heel of the operator's hand remains in intimate contact with a raised portion (78) of the handrest (76). A pair of levers (106, 108) are mounted on the control console assembly (66) adjacent the handrest (76) and operatively actuated by the fingertips of the operator's hand. A rotary knob (86) is oriented on the side of the handrest (76) and operative to be rotated by the thumb of the operator's hand. The various controls for the operating function of the earthworking vehicle is controlled by the fingers of the operator without having to move the heel of his hand from the raised portion (78) of the handrest (76). This allows the operator to have a more finite and smooth control of the various operating functions of the vehicle even though his body is being jostled around due to the earthworking vehicle traversing rough terrain.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an 
earthworking vehicle having a control console with 
various operating functions and more particularly to a 
control console assembly and the orientation of the 
control functions with respect to an operator. Various types of control consoles have been 
available for construction equipment. Many of these 
control console utilize one or more levers which an 
operator grasps and moves in order to control the 
operating functions of the construction vehicle. 
These levers may be moved fore and aft, sideways or 
various combinations thereof, such as, a joy stick 
control which is well known in the art. The known 
controls are capable of providing precise control of 
the respective vehicle operating functions. However, 
due to the jostling of the machine as it traverses 
over rough terrain, the operator is being likewise 
jostled within the vehicle. Consequently, since the 
operator is being jostled around in the vehicle, his 
arm is likewise being moved with his body which tends 
to offset precise control of the lever or levers 
located on the control console. This jostling 
movement of the operator within the cab of the vehicle 
is even more pronounced when operating track type 
vehicles. In one arrangement, a console was provided 
which allowed the operator to control some of the 
vehicle's operating functions by the operator's 
fingers moving electrical switches between an on and 
off position. Even though the operator's hand was  
 
laying on a control console and his fingertips were 
controlling electrical switches, the operator was not 
gaining precise control of the operating function. This is 
true because his hand could still easily move with respect 
to the control console due to the movement of his body, 
thus, possibly causing loss of contact of his fingertips 
with the respective switches. The present invention is directed to overcoming one or 
more of the problems as set forth above. US-A-3 703 931 discloses a vehicle control mechanism 
for use by an operator to control an earthworking vehicle 
having multiple operating functions, the vehicle control 
mechanism comprising a control console assembly oriented, 
in use, adjacent one side of the operator and having, 
connected thereto, a handrest with a top surface; a pair of 
levers pivotally mounted on the control console assembly 
and located adjacent the handrest, each of the levers being 
disposed such as to be movable, in use, by any one of the 
operator's fingertips; a pair of sensors, each being 
opera
