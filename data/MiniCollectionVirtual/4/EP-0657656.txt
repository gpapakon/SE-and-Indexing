<ABSTRACT>
In the hydraulic apparatus according to the present 
invention, flow rate increasing side pressure receiving 

surfaces (4a,4a') in at least one of pressure compensating 
valves (4,4') are greater than flow rate decreasing 

side pressure receiving surfaces (4b,4b') therein so as 
to alleviate the pressure compensation accuracy, thereby 

restraining decrease in the maximum operational speed of 
the hydraulic actuators (5,5').

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic apparatus
for driving a plurality of hydraulic actuators by discharge
hydraulic oil from a single hydraulic pump.To drive a plurality of hydraulic actuators by a
single hydraulic pump, such a parallel circuit type hydraulic
apparatus A as shown in Fig. 7 has commonly been used.In the hydraulic apparatus A, hydraulic oil discharged
from a hydraulic pump B is fed to a first hydraulic actuator
D1 through a first actuating valve C1 and to a second
hydraulic actuator D2 through a second actuating valve C2.However, the above-mentioned arrangement of the
hydraulic apparatus A has such a drawback that if the
hydraulic oil is simultaneously fed to the plurality of
hydraulic actuators D1 and D2, then the quantity of hydraulic
oil fed to a lower load side hydraulic actuator becomes larger
which results in that a higher load side hydraulic actuator is
not supplied with a sufficient quantity of hydraulic oil.Fig. 8 shows a hydraulic apparatus which has been
proposed to obviate the drawback mentioned above.
An apparatus of this type is shown in DE-A-3413 866, which has
been taken as a basis for the preamble of claim 1
In this
hydraulic apparatus A', a first and a second pressure 
compensating valves E1 and E2 are interposed between the first
actuating valve C1 and the first hydraulic actuator D1 and
between the second actuating valve C2 and the second hydraulic
actuator D2.Inlet side pressures of the first and second pressure
compensating valves E1 and E2 are applied as pilot pressure to
the flow rate increasing side pressure receiving surfaces of
the spools in the respective pressure compensating valves E1
and E2, and output pressure from a shuttle valve F interposed
between a hydraulic passage extending from the first pressure
compensating valve E1 to the first hydraulic actuator D1 and a
hydraulic passage extending from the second pressure
compensating valve E2 to the second hydraulic actuator D2, is
applied as pilot pressure to the flow rate decreasing side
pressure receiving surfaces of the respective spools.With the foregoing hydraulic apparatus A', the maximum
hydraulic pressure at the higher load side hydraulic actuator
D1 or D2 is permitted to act on the flow rate decreasing side
pressure receiving surfaces of the pressure compensating
valves E1, E2 under the action of the shuttle valve F, so that
the flow rate of hydraulic oil at that one of the pressure
compensating valves which is coupled to the higher load side
hydraulic actuator, is increased, while the flow
