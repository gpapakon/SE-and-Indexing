<ABSTRACT>
A novel composition suitable for use as a thickener comprising an 
anionic hydroxy containing polymer which is partially or completely 

substituted by one or more sulfonate groups derived from an 
ethylenically unsaturated monomer is provided. The composition is 

capable of producing enhanced viscosities either when used alone, 
or when combined with a cationic polymer and distributed in a 

solvent. The composition is suitable for use in foods, explosives, 
oil field chemicals, textile fibers, paper produces, personal care 

products, agricultural chemicals and cosmetics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anionic thickening composition. 
More specifically, the composition is a polysaccharide or polyol 
which includes sulfonated anionic groups which are derived from 
ethylenically unsaturated monomers including one or more sulfonate 
groups. The resulting compositions function to increase the 
viscosity of an aqueous solution when used alone and can provide 
dramatically enhanced viscosities when combined with cationic 
thickening compositions, particularly cationic polygalactomannans. Natural and synthetic polymers containing hydroxy groups have been 
used as thickeners for foods, coatings, paints, explosive slurries, 
oil well fluids, cosmetics, and many other functional applications. One class of polymers that have been widely used as suspending and 
viscosity agents are polygalactomannans. Polygalactomannans are 
polysaccharides composed principally of galactose and mannose units 
and are usually found in the endosperm of leguminous seeds such as 
guar, locust bean, honey locust, flame tree, and the like. In 
practice, to thicken a fluid the polygalactomannans may either be 
added by themselves, or with other viscosity modifiers such as 
other polygalactomannans, xanthan gum and the like.  Other polymers proposed for use as thickening agents include 
unmodified and modified starches, methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl 
cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyols such as polyvinyl 
alcohol, glycols, glycerols, polyacrylamide, polyvinylpyrrolidone, 
xanthan gum and the like. U.S. Patent No. 3,467,647 discloses polysaccharides containing both 
cationic and anionic substituents. Amongst the starting 
polysaccharides which are then modified according to this patent 
include starches, locust bean gum (carob gum) and guar gum. 
Suggested anionic substituents include carboxyl, sulfonate, sulfate 
or phosphate groups. The reference suggests that sulfonate groups 
may be introduced into the polysaccharide molecule by reacting the 
polysaccharide with sultones, the sodium salt of halo alkane 
sulfonic acids, chlorooxypropane sulfonic acid, epoxypropane 
sulfonic acid or ethene sulfonic acid, in the presence of an 
alkaline catalyst or sodium periodate followed by a treatment with 
sodium or potassium bisulfite. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,264,322; 4,403,360 and 4,454,617 disclose dye 
compositions for textile fibers. The compositions comprise an 
admixture of immiscible gel phases, wherein one gel phase is 
thickened with a cationic gelling agent and wherein a second gel 
phase, which is
