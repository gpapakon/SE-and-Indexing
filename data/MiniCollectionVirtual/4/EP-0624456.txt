<ABSTRACT>
A device for the receiving and advancing of tyre bead wires and for the transfer of the tyre bead wires to the magnetic disc of the bead setting device of a tyre building machine in green tyre production during automatic building of the said green tyre is provided with swivel arms (6), which can be swivelled inwards and outwards by means of a compressed-air cylinder (9) and which bring about a tensioning and centering of the tyre bead wires during swivelling outwards - that is during spreading. In this device, the point of articulation forming the connection between the swivel arms (6) and the compressed-air cylinder (9) is of an adjustable design.

Device for receiving and conveying tire beads and tor transterring the tire
beads to the magnetic disc of the core-setting device of a tire-assembling

machine in the production of the tire blanks during the automatic assembly of the
blanks, the said device being provided with pivot arms (6) which can be pivoted

inwards and outwards by means of a pneumatic cylinder (9) and which when
pivoting outwards - that is to say when spreading - effect a gripping and centring

of the tire beads, wherein the connection between the pivot arms (6) and the
pneumatic cylinder (9) is adjustable, the pivot arms (6) are disposed between a

disc (13) which is non-rotatably connected to the device and a rotatable disc (7)
disposed concentrically therewith, the rotatable disc (7) is connected in an

articulated manner to the piston rod (10) of the pneumatic cylinder (9) and the
pivoting of the pivot arms (6) is effected by rotation of the rotatable disc (7) the

pivot arms (6) being pivotable about bolts (14) fixed on the non-rotatable disc
(13), characterised in that a longitudinal slot (16) is disposed centrally in the

pivot arms (6) and in this slot a further bolt (15) engages which is fixed on the
rotatable disc (7), and that the piston rod (10) of the pneumatic cylinder (9) is

articulated on the rotatable disc (7) by way of a quick-acting lever (11) and an
adjusting bar (12) attached to the rotatable disc (7).
Device for receiving and conveying tire beads and for transferring the tire
beads to the magnetic disc of the core-setting device of a tire-assembling

machine in the production of the tire blanks during the automatic assembly of the
blanks, the said device being provided with pivot arms (6) which can be pivoted

inwards and outwards by means of a pneumatic cylinder (9) and which when 
pivoting outwards - that is to say when spreading - effect a gripping and centring

of the tire beads, wherein the connection between the pivot arms (6) and the
pneumatic cylinder (9) is adjustable, the pivot arms (6) are disposed between a

disc (13) which is non-rotatably connected to the device and a rotatable disc (7)
disposed concentrically therewith the rotatable disc (7) is connected in an

articulated manner to the piston rod (10) of the pneumatic cylinder (9) and the
pivoting of the pivot arms (6) is effected by rotation of the rotatable disc (7), the

pivot arms (6) being pivotable about bolts (14) fixed on the non-rotatable disc
(13), characterised in that a longitudinal slot (16) is disposed centrally in the

pivot arms (6) and in this slot a further bolt (15) engages which is fixed on the
rotatable disc (7), and that the rotatable disc (27) has a concentrically disposed

longitudinal slot (31) through which is passed a fixing bolt (32) which connects
the piston rod (30) of the pneumatic cylinder (29) to the rotatable disc (27).
Device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that a pneumatic
cylinder (9, 29) and pivot arms (6) are provided in each case on the right-hand

side and on the left-hand side of the device.
Device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a rotatable
roller (5) which serves to receive the tire beads is attached to each of the pivot

arms (6).
