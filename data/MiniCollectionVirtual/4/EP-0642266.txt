<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an
image signal processor and, more particularly, to the image
signal processor of a type used in connection with a video
output device such as, for example, television receiver set,
video tape player (VTR) or video camera for storing a video
signal outputted from the video output device and for
subsequently writing the stored video signal in a graphic
memory in a personal computer in the form of a still or
frozen picture.With the advent of widespread use of semiconductor
memories, numerous image signal processors of the type
referred to above have been proposed and made commercially
available. When the image signal descriptive of one frozen
picture is read in the personal computer through the image
signal processor, an operator of the personal computer can
perform an image analysis of the frozen picture or an image
processing such as enlargement or reduction of the frozen
picture, or extraction or highlighting of one or more
portions of the frozen.According to the prior art, the image signal
processor is provided with a memory device for the storage
of a digitized image signal. When a WRITE-IN control signal
or a READ-OUT control signal is supplied to the memory 
device, the image signal can be inputted to or outputted
from the memory device, respectively.Generally in the prior art image signal processor,
when the image signal stored in the memory device is desired
to be read out from the memory device for the transfer to
the personal computer, the following process takes place.
Specifically, after the image signal representative of one
frozen picture has been written in the memory device in the
image signal processor, the image signal processor issues to
the personal computer a signal notifying the personal computer
that the image signal has been stored in the memory
device. The personal computer subsequently interrogate the
image signal processor if the image signal stored in the
memory device can be read out from the memory device. The
image signal processor so interrogated then issues to the
personal computer a READY signal notifying the personal computer
that the image signal in the memory device is ready to
be read out therefrom. After this interrogation, the image
signal is transferred onto the personal computer. The image
signal so read out from the memory device is then stored in
an internal graphic memory in the personal computer.According to the prior art, in order for the image
signal stored in the memory device to be transferred onto
the personal
