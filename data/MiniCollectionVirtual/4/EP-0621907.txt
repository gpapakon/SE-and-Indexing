<ABSTRACT>
In a method for cleaning articles, especially for removing flux after soldering, an article is contacted with a hydrocarbon-containing fluid containing one or more hydrocarbons selected from C8 to C15 paraffinic and naphthenic hydrocarbons and with an alcohol-containing fluid containing one or more alcohols selected from C5 to C15 straight-chain or branched-chain, saturated aliphatic alcohols. The hydrogen-containing fluid and alcohol-containing fluid are preferably in the form of a liquid mixture. Efficient cleaning of articles, for example of electronic components after soldering, is possible without the use of halogen-containing solvents.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND COMPOSITION FOR CLEANING ARTICLESThe present invention relates to a method of cleaning articles, and to a cleaning composition for use in the method. In the manufacture of printed circuit boards(PCBs), it is usual for soldering flux to be applied to the boards to promote strong bonding of the solder to the board. The flux and solder may be applied, for example, by the wave soldering method or the reflow soldering method. After soldering, flux remains on the boards.That residual flux must be removed in order to reduce the possibility of early circuit failure.The fluxes used in the manufacture of electronic components, for example, PCBs, using a soldering technique are generally rosin-containing fluxes or synthetic water-soluble fluxes. Rosin-containing fluxes include rosin mildly activated (RMA) and rosin activated (RA) fluxes, which are obtained by activation of a rosin- containing flux using, for example, organic acids, amines, amides or halogen-containing compounds. Many of the activating materials decompose on soldering thus giving rise to inorganic substances that can damage the electronic components. The residue to be removed thus comprises a combination of rosin molecules and inorganic substances.In many previously used methods for defluxing articles after soldering, the residual flux has been removed using halogenated hydrocarbon solvents. It has 

become recognised in recent years, however, that these solvents have a particularly harmful effect on the environment. Further, because of their physical properties, special requirements are required in their storage, handling and disposal. It is therefore desirable to avoid the use of halogenated hydrocarbon solvents, "if possible.European Patent Specification No. 416,763 discloses compositions for cleaning dirty articles, for example, PCBs, comprising terpene hydrocarbons or other non- halogenated solvents. After the cleaning step, remaining traces of solvent are said to be removed azeotropically, by forming an azeotrope between the solvent and an aqueous medium, the azeotropic mixture being evaporated from the surface of the article. Optionally, a low boiling organic solvent, for example a ketone, amine, ether or alcohol may be included in the cleaning composition to promote formation of an azeotrope. The low boiling organic solvent, if present, is preferred to be a C3 to C4 alcohol.Japanese Patent Specification No. 3-6300 discloses the use of an oleophilic detergent comprising a terpene hydrocarbon selected from IOC monoterpenes to 15C
