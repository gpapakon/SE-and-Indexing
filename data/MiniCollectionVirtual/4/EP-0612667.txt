<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a base cup 
that can be a snap-fit or an interference-fit or a 
screw-fit onto the base of rounded or spherical 
base plastic bottles in order to allow such 
bottles to be free standing. Spherical or rounded 
base plastic bottles appear to be one of the more 
efficient methods of bottle design particularly 
where pressure is developed in the bottle. Such a 
bottle, however, requires a support base in order 
to allow such a bottle to be free standing. Plastic bottles are well known in the art. 
Also well known in the art are many methods and 
designs for molding a particular base in a plastic 
bottle during the blow molding process of forming 
the bottle in order to allow the bottle to be free 
standing. For example such prior art includes 
U.S. Patents 4,989,738, 3,871,541, 3,598,270 and 
3,935,955 all of which are directed to particular 
molded base designs fabricated during molding of 
the plastic bottle. When molding free standing 
plastic bottles that have a flat or concave base 
or particular design as described in the above 
patents, residual stresses are developed in the 
base of the bottles during molding. With pressure 
developing in the bottle from carbonation or just 
the weight of the liquid itself and particularly 
when the bottle is subjected to rewashing under 
elevated temperatures, this can aggravate the 
residual stresses in the base of the bottle and  
 
can result in failure of the bottle. These 
residual stresses in the base of the bottle 
develop during molding of the bottle. Stresses in 
a spherical or rounded base bottle, however, are 
greatly reduced during molding and is therefore a 
better bottle design particularly for bottles that 
are intended to be subjected to multiple washing 
and filling cycles with carbonated beverages. 
Even uncarbonated liquids develop pressure on the 
base of the bottle and therefore can result in 
failure due to aggravation of the residual 
stresses set up in the base. Currently there is a need for plastic bottles 
that can withstand multiple washing cycles. Such 
reuseable bottles help to reduce the plastic waste 
problem that exists with the current one-use throw 
away polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic 
bottles. Copending European patent applications 
assigned to the same assignee of the instant 
invention, 93305560, 93305561 and 
93305562, all of which are incorporated herein by 
reference, address the problem of plastic waste 
from plastic one-use throw away bottles by 
disclosing therein multilayer
