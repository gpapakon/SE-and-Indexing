<ABSTRACT>
A motor vehicle luggage compartment or tailgate has an 
outer skin 4 through which a lock cylinder 9 is inserted 

via a hole in the skin of such size and shape as to 
prevent a bezel 17 on the outer end of the lock from 

passing through. The mounting arrangement for the lock 
comprises a bracket welded to the skin and having an 

upstanding portion 5 spaced from the inner surface of the 
skin 4 and on which a plate 8 attached to the cylinder 9 

at a set distance from the bezel 17 locates. The bracket 
will resist the pulling out of the cylinder from the skin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mounting arrangement for a lid 
or door lock and particularly but not exclusively to a 
mounting arrangement for the lock of a luggage compartment 
door or tailgate of a motor vehicle. Accordingly the present invention will be described below 
with reference to motor vehicles but it should be 
appreciated that the invention may be employed for a lock 
on any lid or door which lock may be susceptible to being 
forcibly removed particularly by pulling it out to gain 
access to an opening mechanism. While the protection against theft of personal valuables 
carried in a motor vehicle may often be improved by 
locking such items in the luggage or rear compartment of 
the vehicle, such compartments are vulnerable to being 
broken into. Common methods employed for breaking into such 
compartments include forcible removal of the cylinder of 
the lock to gain access to the door release mechanism. 
This may be done by applying high torque to the lock 
cylinder to wrench it out of its supporting surfaces 
(sometimes referred to as "torquing out"). Alternatively, 
high pulling forces may be applied to pull out the 
cylinder (sometimes referred to generally as "pulling 
out"). Further, by applying high leverage forces to the 
cylinder the supporting surfaces may be bent or distorted 
to permit cylinder removal or to otherwise gain access to 
the release mechanism (sometimes referred to generally as 
"bending out"). While it has been proposed, for example, in US Patent  
 
Specification 4 041 741, to apply a protective plate to 
the outside of the door to prevent the lock from being 
pulled out, this is an aesthetically unattractive solution 
proposal. Further, the proposal of this US Patent 4 041 
741 requires additional holes to be produced through the 
door skin, which adds to potential corrosion sites. It is also known from US Patent Specification 3 868 836 
to provide a bracket within the door to support an inner 
end of a lock barrel. In this construction, a limited 
resistance to twisting of the lock mechanism in the panel 
is achieved by engagement of flats on the barrel with 
opposite legs of a spring clip. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
mounting arrangement for mounting a lock to a vehicle skin 
panel, the arrangement comprising a lock cylinder, a hole 
in the skin panel for receiving the lock cylinder and a 
bracket which has a foot portion fixed to the skin panel 
at a distance from the inner surface of the 
portion of said skin panel on which said

<CLAIMS>
A mounting arrangement for mounting a lock to a 
vehicle skin panel, the arrangement comprising a lock 

cylinder (9), a hole in the skin panel (4) for receiving 
the lock cylinder and a bracket (1) which has a foot portion 

(3) fixed to the skin panel (4) at a distance from the 
inner surface of the portion of said skin panel on which 

said hole is provided, and an upstanding portion 
(5), characterised in that the arrangement includes a 

plate (8) mounted on the cylinder (9) and fixed against 
rotation relative to the cylinder, the plate locating 

behind the bracket (1) so that engagement of the plate 
against the bracket resists pull-out forces exerted on the 

cylinder, and wherein the upstanding portion (5) of the bracket (1) is 
provided with spaced holes (6,7) and the plate (8) has 

corresponding spigots (14,15) which fit in the holes to 
resist twisting forces exerted on the cylinder (9). 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that the plate (8) has a non-circular hole (16), and 

the cylinder (9) has a corresponding non-circular part 
which fits through the hole so that the plate cannot 

rotate relative to the cylinder, the arrangement also 
including a retaining clip (10) adapted to fit into a 

groove (20) on the end of the cylinder to retain the plate 
on the cylinder. 
An arrangement as claimed in Claim 2, characterised 
in that the retaining clip occupies the groove around at 

least 120Â° of arc. 
An arrangement as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the cylinder (9) has a radially 

extending flange (17) at its key-receiving end, and a 
tubular spacer sleeve (11) is fitted around the cylinder  

 
to space the plate (8) from the flange. 
A luggage compartment lid including a mounting 

arrangement as claimed in any preceding claim.
