<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of a silver 
halide tabular grain emulsion rich in chloride with improved 
sensitometric characteristics and to photographic materials 
containing such an emulsion. High aspect ratio tabular grains exhibit several pronounced 
photographic advantages. Thanks to their particular morphology 
greater amounts of spectral sensitizers can be adsorbed per mole 
silver halide compared to classical globular grains. As a 
consequence such spectrally sensitized tabular grains show an 
improved speed-granularity relationship and a wide separation 
between their blue speed and minus blue speed. Sharpness of 
photographic images can be improved using tabular grains thanks to 
their lower light scattering properties again compared to 
conventional globular emulsion grains. In color negative materials 
the conventional sequence of the light sensitive layers can be 
altered and the yellow filter layer can be omitted. In developed 
black-and-white images high covering power is obtained even at high 
hardening levels; alternatively reduced silver halide coverages can 
be achieved if wanted resulting again in improved sharpness. In 
double coated radiographic materials the presence of tabular grains 
reduces the so-called cross-over which is the dominant factor for 
sharpness in such materials. The early patent disclosures on high aspect tabular grains, e.g. 
US 4,434,226, US 4,439,520, US 4,425,425, US 4,425,426 and 
US 4,433,048 are concerned with high sensitive silver bromide or 
silver iodobromide emulsions. However in a lot of photographic 
applications high sensitivity is of less importance. In these cases 
the use of chloride rich emulsions is advantageous e.g. thanks to 
their higher development and fixing rates. Typical examples include 
graphic arts materials, duplicating materials, hard-copy materials, 
diffusion transfer reversal materials and black-and-white or color 
print materials. So it would be interesting to try to combine the 
advantages of chloride rich emulsions with the advantages of tabular 
grain structure.  When using conventional precipitation conditions chloride rich 
emulsion grains show a cubic morphology with (100) crystal faces. It 
is known that to alter this crystallographic habit into a (111) 
habit so-called "growth modifiers" or "crystal habit modifiers" are 
required. Klein and Moisar, in Berichte der Bunsengesellschaft Vol. 
67 (4), p. 349-355, report inhibition of the growth rate of silver 
chloride by purine bases such as adenine.
