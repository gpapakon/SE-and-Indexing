<ABSTRACT>
Control means for viewing apparatus (10) providing autostereoscopic images comprises a detector (21) for detecting movement of a viewer's head and a computer for controlling operation of lamps (13, 14; 17, 18; 27) in accordance with signals received from the detector (21), such operation resulting in movement of viewing zones so as to maintain a stereo view for a moving viewer and/or to enable the presentation of images with continuous or quasi-continuous parallax in one, two or three dimensions and/or to provide a plurality of viewing zones to enable mono or stereo viewing by more than one person at a time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to control means for viewing apparatus 
and, more particularly, viewing apparatus of the type 
disclosed in WO 93/02372. The viewing apparatus disclosed in WO 93/02372 includes a 
holographic recording of a diffusely illuminated zone, means 
for illuminating the holographic recording from a plurality of 
different positions such that images of the zone are 
reconstructed forming viewing zones and a non-projected 
masking means located adjacent the holographic recording for 
effecting spatial modulation of light from the respective 
positions, the arrangement being such as to provide a 
plurality of viewing zones whereby the spatial modulation can 
be seen from a corresponding one of the zones. A similar apparatus is disclosed in DE-A-40 04 739. A problem associated with the prior art viewing apparatus is that the 
images are visible only in one position and provide no 
movement parallax. The invention provides control means for the viewing apparatus 
and is characterised in that the control means includes means 
for detecting movement and position of a viewer and for 
controlling operation of the illuminating means so that the 
viewer continues to observe the images. Therefore, a viewing apparatus provided with control means 
in accordance with the present invention overcomes the problem  
 
referred to above by tracking the position of the viewer and 
moving the viewing locations to maintain a stereo effect. Following is a description by way of example only and with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, of one method of 
carrying the invention into effect. In the drawings:- 
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of viewing apparatus 
including an embodiment of control means in accordance with 
the present invention, Figure 2 is a diagrammatic representation of viewing apparatus 
including another embodiment of control means in accordance 
with the present invention, Figure 3 is a side elevation of the apparatus shown in Figure 
2, and Figure 4 is a schematic diagram of the embodiment of the 
control means shown in Figures 2 and 3. Referring now to Figure 1 of the drawings, there is shown a 
viewing apparatus 10 similar to the apparatus disclosed in 
WO 93/02372 and including a diffusing holographic optical 
element (HOE) 11, a liquid crystal display (LCD) 12 located 
adjacent the HOE 11 and a pair of lamps 13 and 14 operable 
alternately in rapid succession for illuminating the combined  
 
HOE 11 and LCD 12 making visible images on the LCD 12 from 
viewing zones 15 and 16
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A viewing apparatus (10) including a 
holographic recording (11) of a diffusely illuminated 

zone, means (13,14; 17,18) for illuminating the 
holographic recording (11) from a plurality of different 

positions such that images of the zone are reconstructed 
forming viewing zones (15,16; 19,20) and a non-projected 

masking means (12) located adjacent the holographic 
recording (11) for effecting spatial modulation of light 

from the respective positions such that conventional two 
dimensional images on the masking means (12) are visible 

from the viewing zones (15,16; 19,20) characterised by 
control means that includes means (21) for detecting 

the position and movement of a viewer and for controlling 
the operation of the illuminating means (13,14; 17,18) so 

that the viewer continues to observe the images. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that 
each image comprises component images of a stereo pair 

and the illumination means (13,14; 17,18) is controlled 
to illuminate alternate images of the stereo pair to 

provide a stereoscopic effect. 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 characterised in that 
the stereo images change with movement of the viewer so 

as to provide a continuous parallax effect. 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding  
 

Claims characterised in that the images are viewable by 
multiple viewers.
