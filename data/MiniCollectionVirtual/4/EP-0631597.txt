<ABSTRACT>
Porous material of a polysaccharide and a method for preparations of such a material, wherein a water-based solution of the polysaccharide is mixed, with controlled stirring, with an essentially water-immiscible organic phase to form an emulsion, which when allowed to solidify, just before or during the gelling process, forms a network of two continuous phases, an aqueous polysaccharide phase and a flow-pore-forming organic phase, resulting in a material with two types of pores: small diameter diffusion pores and large diameter flow through pores.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to polysaccharide gels
containing, besides pores of a molecular dimension, for
instance 20-500 Å, also interconnected macroscopic pores,
typically with a pore diameter about 0.5-500 micrometers.
These new materials have been found to considerably broaden
the application areas for polysaccharide gels which have many
advantageous characteristics for use in biotechniques, like
chromatographic separations, membrane separation technology
and support for solid phase chemistry, especially in
biologically sensitive systems.These superporous polysaccharide gels are produced by mixing a
water-containing solution of the polysaccharide with an
essentially water immiscible organic phase under vigorous
stirring whereafter the finely dispersed mixture is allowed to
solidify and the organic phase finally is washed away. The
above organic phase is the superpore-forming phase. It must
therefore be composed in such a way that it can exist as a
continuous phase in the presence of a continuous agarose
phase.The new polysaccharide gels may be produced in various shapes,
for instance more or less regular beads like spheres,
membranes, etc, and can be used as a base matrix for the
manufacture of chromatographic media, and as a carrier matrix
in general for various biomolecules like cells, enzymes,
antibodies etc.Polysaccharide gels are known to play an important role for
the manufacture of materials for separation of mixtures of
biomolecules. Among the characteristics making these gels
especially interesting can be mentioned their inertness in
contact with proteins and other biomolecules and their porous
structure. A further important property is their resistance
against alkaline conditions, which is of great importance in 
large scale separation processes requiring frequent
regeneration/sterilization of the gel. Polysaccharide gels
unlike many other separation materials allow such in situ
regeneration with, for instance 1 M NaOH, which is an
effective agent, frequently used for purification and
sterilization.Polysaccharide gels are used for various types of
chromatography. One such example is gel filtration, whereby
the sample constituents are size fractionated. This is an
application where the inertness is of crucial importance since
any interaction between the gel material as such and the
sample molecules makes the separation less effective and might
even completely destroy the result. Commercially very
important materials for this type of separation have, for many
years, been produced from

A method for producing porous materials of a polysaccharide
comprising the steps:


a. mixing with controlled stirring a water-based solution
of the polysaccharide with a water-immiscible organic

phase to form an emulsion, and
b. solidifying the mixture to form the porous material,
characterized
 by selected process parameters having been
verified in a test run to give an emulsion that just before

or during the solidification process will form a network,
as verified by e.g. microscope studies, of a continuous

aqueous polysaccharide phase and a continuous flow through
pore forming organic phase, so that the solidification

process will result in a polysaccharide matrix having flow
through pores.

characterized

in that the polysaccharide comprises one or more
polysaccharides from the group consisting of agarose,

alginate, dextran and cellulose.

characterized

in that the polysaccharide is agarose and that the emulsion
before the solidification process is mixed with a water-immiscible

organic solvent containing a "water-in-oil"-stabilising
detergent at a controlled stirring rate and for

a controlled time whereafter the solidification process is
allowed to proceed by lowering the temperature below the 

gelling temperature of agarose.
