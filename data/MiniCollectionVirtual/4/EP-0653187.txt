<ABSTRACT>
A peak flow meter is provided which comprises an 
elongated body (22) having a longitudinal direction and a 

predetermined cross sectional shape and a growing area. 
The body (22) has an open entering end (24) and an open 

exit end (26). The body (22) is circumferentially 
continuous substantially from end to end. A piston (52) 

and an indicator (68) are mounted in said body (22) for 
movement longitudinally thereof upon exhalation into the 

open entering end (24). The indicator (68) is pushed 
along said body (22) for movement by the piston (52) 

longitudinally of said body (22). The indicator (68) is 
of low mass so as not to overshoot, and is returned to 

rest by shaking a weight (82) against it. A logarithmic 
scale is provided along said body (22) against which the 

position of said indicator (68) can be read.

<DESCRIPTION>
Many patients have respiratory problems, and it
often is advantageous for a doctor to be able to ascertain the
maximum peak rate of flow of a single forced expiration. It
is further desirable to have a small instrument readily used
by the patient himself to measure the peak flow. With a peak
flow meter it is possible for the patient to ascertain if his
peak flow rate remains at a more or less constant level, or if
it deteriorates over time, or if it improves.Instruments for such use, especially by patients,
have been developed and are available commercially. However,
the instruments now on the market are not fully satisfactory.
They often have a member extending through a slot in a
cylindrical body and blown along the body by a patient's
exhalation into the cylindrical body. Such type of
construction allows for entry of contaminants into the body,
some of which leave residue that impairs movement of the
indicator member along the slot. Most such meters have
compressed scales which are difficult to read.It is desirable that upon initial testing by the
doctor a marker be applied to the meter indicating desirable
range for the particular patient, as well as an improved range
and a poor or deteriorating range. Such markers as known
today are generally not satisfactory in that they are not
capable of representing a percentage above or below the
desirable range, since the desirable range for a given patient
might be quite different from that of another patient. All 
that can be indicated is a fixed number above or below the desirable
range, but there will be a different percentage of the desirable range
depending upon where the desirable range is located on the meter.In accordance with known meters, as indicated above, having a
slot in the body through which the indicator moves, an opportunity is
presented for a patient accidentally to block movement of the indicator
with a misplaced finger. In the usual case the indicator is moved by a
piston within the body, and as the piston travels along the body a
progressively greater amount of air is expelled through the slot as the
piston moves from rest position. Accordingly, the piston travels to a
point at which the venting of air from the body balances a spring
restraining the piston. Upon the cessation of blowing, the piston is
returned to rest position by the spring, with the indicator remaining in
the position reached until manually returned to rest position. The
indicator must be of a relatively lightweight construction. If it is heavy, it
will have inertia,

<CLAIMS>
A peak flow meter for determining peak air flow of an exhaling
patient comprising:


a hollow body (22) for accommodating a flow of exhaled air
therethrough;
an indicator (68) associated with said body (22) and movable
relative to said body (22) to a position along a scale on said body (22), said

position being related to a peak of the flow of exhaled air through said body
(22); and characterized in that
said body (22) has an internal cross-sectional area that varies along
a longitudinal axis of said body and is related to said scale such that said scale

represents a logarithmic scale (83) of the peak of the exhaled flow of air
through said body (22).
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by at
least one zone (88, 90, 92) adjacent said logarithmic scale (83), said

zone (88, 90, 92) indicating a predetermined range of a patient's air flow
independent of placement along said logarithmic scale (83).
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by an
approval tape (84) affixable adjacent said scale, said approval tape (84)

indicating at least one zone representing a range of the patient's peak air
flow.
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in
that the zones on the tape (84) are related logarithmically to the scale. 
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in
that said approval tape (84) is a transparent tape and said zones are a

plurality of contiguous bands for marking a reasonable range of
exhalation.
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in
that said approval tape (84) is affixable to said scale at various locations.
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by:

the hollow body (22) having an entering end (24) and an exit
end (26);
the indicator (68) is movable along said body (22) from a first
position in response to a flow of air through said body (22) from the

entering end (24) to the exit end (26);
movement balancing means (52, 60) for balancing movement of
said indicator (68) along said body (22) so that said indicator (68) moves

to a second position along said body (22), said second position related to
a peak flow of air through said body (22); and
a return mass (82) for returning said indicator (68) to said first
position independently of said movement balancing means (52, 60).
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 7, characterized in
that the return mass (82) is a pair of spherical balls (128). 
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 7, further
characterized by:

   indicator mounting means (48) for mounting said indicator (68)
inside the hollow body (22).
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 7, characterized in
that said movement balancing means (52, 60) is a piston (52) slidably

mounted on said indicator mounting means (48) and a spring (60)
attached to said piston (52).
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 10, characterized in
that the return mass (82) is slidably mounted on said mounting means

(48) between the indicator (68) and the exit end (26).
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by:

indicator moving means (52, 60) associated with said body (22),
separate from said indicator (68), for moving said indicator (68) from a

first position to a second position, said second position related to a peak
flow of air through said body (22); and

completely inside said hollow body (22).
The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 12, characterized in
that the diameter of said hollow body (22) enlarges non-linearly from the

The peak flow meter as claimed in Claim 12, characterized in
that said hollow body (22) has an interior surface having a frosted area

and a clear area, said clear area being a rectangular portion aligned
along said body (22) such that the indicator (68) may be viewed through

the clear portion.
