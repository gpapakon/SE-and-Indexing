<ABSTRACT>
The title compounds, which in one and the same molecule contain a (meth)acrylate group and a urethane group as well as other polymerisable groups and can undergo both free-radical and/or cationic polymerisation, are used for the production of coatings, adhesives, photoresists, solder resist masks or in stereolithography. The shaped articles produced therefrom contain a coherent, homogeneous network and have high strength properties, above all mechanical properties.
