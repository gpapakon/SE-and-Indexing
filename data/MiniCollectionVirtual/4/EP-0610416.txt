<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns improvements to toroidal-shaped L.P.G. tanks (1) which, due to their particular shape, may be easily placed inside the spare wheel compartment (10). In the toroidal-shaped tank described herein the hollow centre of the tank is used for positioning the valve group connection rings (3), which may either project or be flush-mounted and also for allowing the passage of the pipes (4, 5) for connecting the tank with the engine fuel supply system and the filler. The valves are placed between a lid (6), at the top, and a bottom plate (7) tide to each other in such a manner as to constitute an airtight chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements to toroidal-shaped 
L.P.G. tanks which, due to their particular shape, 
may be easily placed inside the spare wheel compartment. 
In the toroidal-shaped tank described herein the hollow 
centre of the tank is used for positioning the valve 
group connection rings, which may either project or be 
flush-mounted and also for allowing the passage of the 
pipes for connecting the tank with the engine fuel supply 
system and the filler. The valves are placed between a lid, at the top, and a 
bottom plate tied to each other in such a manner as to 
constitute an airtight chamber In L.P.G. tanks and, in particular, in the toroidal-shaped 
tanks produced to date, the fuel-filling valve 
group is generally located on the outside of the tank 
itself, so that it is necessary to make a hole for 
connecting the valve group with the outside filler. 
Alternative solutions also patented by the same holder 
describe the possibility of positioning the multivalve  
 
connection ring in a recessed position, with regard to 
the tank walls. Such a solution, however, determines bulky appendixes 
which may cause problems. Other alternative solutions have been described, for 
example, in FR Patent NÂ° 883.075 and GB 117.343 and in AT 
Patent 370.367, which comprises the features defined in the 
preamble of claim 1. FR Patent 883.075 shows a ring-shaped tank that can 
be placed in the hollow intended for the spare tire, in 
particular for the external spare tire of motor vehicles, 
and is provided with a valve for filling it that can be 
reached from the central inside part of the tank. GB Patent 117.343 describes a toroidal tank with the 
filling valve placed in the middle, empty part of the tank 
itself. AT Patent 370.367 describes a tank for GPL in 
which two bases of a ring-shaped tank are united to each 
other by a tubular, modeled element.  
 This invention provides for a toroidal-shaped according to 
claim 1 tank 
with the possibility of positioning the multivalve ring, 
for both the Italian and the foreign markets, placed in the hollow 
space in the centre of the tank, either projecting or flush-mounted 
in the tank itself, allowing the passage of the 
two pipes which connect the tank with the engine fuel 
supply system and the filler, said pipes passing through 
small holes specifically designed for the ventilation of 
the chamber, by means of a breather flange located on the 
bottom of the luggage compartment (and protected on the 
outside by a carter), in order to position it in the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A toroidal-shaped tank (1) which may be housed inside 
the spare wheel compartment and provided with a 

multivalve group (14) placed in the hollow space in the 
centre of the tank (13), this hollow space being further 

limited by a bottom plate (7) and an opening at the top, 
the tubing for filling and feeding passing through the 

centre of the tank (1),
 
characterized by
 
an airtight lid (6), held solidly to said bottom plate 

(7) by means of bolts (8) or other fast closing means 
(23) that connect the lid (6) and the bottom plate (7) 

and thereby attach it solidly to the tank (1). 
A toroidal shaped tank (1) according to claim 1, wherein said 
airtight lid (6) is provided with a transparent window (9) 

made of glass or other similar material allowing the inspection 
of the multivalve (14) without having to open the airtight 

chamber.
