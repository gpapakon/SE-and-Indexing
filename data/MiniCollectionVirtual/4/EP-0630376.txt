<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compounds having pharmacological activity, to a
process for their preparation and to their use as pharmaceuticals.EP-A-429984 (Nisshin Flour Milling Co., Ltd.) describes indole derivatives having 5-HT3
receptor antagonist activity.European Journal of Pharmacology 146 (1988), 187-188, and Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's
Arch. Pharmacol. (1989) 340:403-410, describe a non classical 5-hydroxytryptamine
receptor, now designated the 5-HT4 receptor, and that ICS 205-930,
which is also a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, acts as an antagonist at this receptor.WO 91/16045 (SmithKline and French Laboratories Limited) describes the use of
cardiac 5-HT4 receptor antagonists in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias and stroke.EP-A-501322 (Glaxo Group Limited) describes indole derivatives having 5-HT4
antagonist activity.A class of novel, structurally distinct compounds has now been discovered, which
compounds are indole derivatives 1,2-disubstituted by alkyleneoxy, with an azacyclic,
fused azabicyclic or aminoalkyl moiety. These compounds have 5-HT4 receptor
antagonist activity.Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I), or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:

X is O, S, SO, SO2, CH2, CH or NR wherein R is hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl or C3-6
cycloalkyl;A is a saturated or unsaturated polymethylene chain of 2 - 4 carbon atoms; R1 and R2 are hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl or C3-6 cycloalkyl;R3 is hydrogen, halo, C1-6 alkyl, C3-6 cycloalkyl, amino, nitro or C1-6 alkoxy;R4 is hydrogen, halo, C1-6 alkyl, C3-6 cycloalkyl or C1-6 alkoxy;Y is O or NH;Z is of sub-formula (a), (b) or (c):

R10 is selected from cyano, hydroxyl, C1-6 alkoxy, phenoxy, C(O)C1-6 alkyl,
COC6H5, -CONR11R12, NR11COR12, SO2NR11R12 or NR11SO2R12wherein R11 and R12 are hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl or C3-6 cycloalkyl;R6, R7 and R8 are independently hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl or C3-6 cycloalkyl ;R9 is hydrogen, C1-6 alkyl or C3-6 cycloalkyl; and
the dotted line in sub-formula (a) indicates the R5 group is absent when the
-(CH2)n1- group is directly attached to the nitrogen of the azacycle;
or a compound of formula (I) wherein the CO-Y linkage is replaced by a heterocyclic
bioisostere of formula (d): 

wherein
the dotted circle represents one or two double bonds in any position in the 5-membered
ring; H, J and I independently
