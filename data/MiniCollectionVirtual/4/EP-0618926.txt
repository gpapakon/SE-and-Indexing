<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new competitive inhibitors of
thrombin, their synthesis, pharmaceutical compositions
containing the compounds as active ingredients, and the
use of the compounds as anticoagulants for prophylaxis and
treatment of thromboembolic diseases such as venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, in particular
myocardial infarction and cerebral thrombosis, general
hypercoagulable states and local hypercoagulable states, e.g.
following angioplasty and coronary bypass operations.The invention also relates to novel use of a compound as a
starting material in synthesis of a serine protease
inhibitor. Furthermore the invention relates to a novel
structural fragment in a serine protease inhibitor.Blood coagulation is the key process involved in both
haemostasis (i.e. prevention of blood loss from a damaged
vessel) and thrombosis (i.e. the pathological occlusion of a
blood vessel by a blood clot). Coagulation is the result of a
complex series of enzymatic reactions, where one of the final
steps is conversion of the proenzyme prothrombin to the
active enzyme thrombin.Thrombin plays a central role in coagulation. It activates
platelets, it converts fibrinogen into fibrin monomers, which
polymerise spontaneously into filaments, and it activates
factor XIII, which in turn crosslinks the polymer to
insoluble fibrin. Thrombin further activates factor V and
factor VIII in a positive feedback reaction. Inhibitors of
thrombin are therefore expected to be effective 
anticoagulants by inhibition of platelets, fibrin formation
and fibrin stabilization. By inhibiting the positive feedback
mechanism they are expected to excert inhibition early in the
chain of events leading to coagulation and thrombosis.Inhibitors of thrombin based on the amino acid sequence
around the cleavage site for the fibrinogen Aα chain were
first reported by Blombäck et al in J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 24,
suppl 107, 59, (1969), who suggested the sequence Phe-Val-Arg
(P9-P2-P1, herein referred to as the P3-P2-P1 sequence) to be
the best inhibitor.In US 4,346,078 (Richter Gedeon Vegyeszeti Gyar R T, priority
date 7.10.1980) and in Peptides 1983 by Walter de Gruyter &
Co, Berlin, pp 643-647, S. Bajusz et al described the
thrombin inhibitor H-DPhe-Pro-Agm, a dipeptidyl derivative
with an aminoalkyl guanidine in the P1-position.S. Bajusz et. al. also reported in J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33,
1729-1735 and in EP-A2-0,185,390 (Richter Gedeon Vegyeszeti
Gyar R T) (priority date 21.12.84) that replacing the
