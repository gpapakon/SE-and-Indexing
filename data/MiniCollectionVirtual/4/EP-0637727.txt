a cross-flow heat exchanger is disclosed, in which first 

and second layers (12,14) having closed passageways (16) are stacked 
transversely and thereafter fired at a temperature and for 

a time sufficient to form a monolithic ceramic structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cross-flow heat 
exchangers and a method for producing them. Cross-flow heat exchangers are heat exchangers in 
which gas or fluid may flow in at least two directions 
through the heat exchanger. Such heat exchangers have a 
variety of uses, such as, for example, as catalytic 
converters, furnace heat recuperators, turbine engine 
recuperators, and for process fluid heating or cooling. 
The same structure may also be used as cross-flow filters 
or bleed-through reactors. Heat exchangers are typically formed by first 
extruding a honeycomb like body of ceramic material from a 
die orifice. This extrusion results in a block of ceramic 
material having flow channels or cells which are typically 
of square or other rectangular cross-section, arranged 
parallel and adjacent to one another along the axis of 
extrusion. Channels with Z-, L-, U- or similar cross-flow are 
typically made by sawing into the sides of some of the 
channels in the ceramic block and afterwards sealing the 
ends of these channels, see U.S. patents 4,271,110, 
4,421,702 and 4,298,059.  To avoid leakage paths between channels, the extrusion 
and cutting must be extremely precise. Also, non-straight paths make such heat exchangers 
more difficult to washcoat and/or catalyze and to inspect, 
as line of sight inspection is not possible. Furthermore, greater pressure is needed, during 
routine engine operations, to force the fluid or gas 
through, and in automotives reduces engine performance. Further, sawing into the side makes precise uniform 
cutting of the ends of the body very difficult, generating 
leakage paths between adjacent channels. Cross-flow heat exchangers with straight channels in 
two directions are shown by U.S. Patents 4,083,400, 
4,130,160, 3,854,186, 4,379,109, 4,362,209, sometimes being 
made by stacking alternating layers, each transverse to the 
preceding one. This is time consuming, and may deform the 
channels, especially when stacked green (unfired). The present invention is directed to a cross-flow heat 
exchanger and a method for forming which avoids the 
deficiencies of prior art cross-flow heat exchangers and 
methods for forming. Basically the inventive method comprises:
 
   contacting a first directional layer of fluid flow 
passages with a second directional layer of fluid flow 
passages, at least some of the passages of each of said 
first and second layers comprising closed passages disposed 
between two open and opposite ends, said first and second 
layers arranged so
