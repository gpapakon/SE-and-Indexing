<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of and
apparatus for attaching objects such as pour spouts to
objects such as planar portions of articles. More
particularly, the present invention relates to methods of
and apparatuses for attaching pour spouts to gable tops of
paperboard cartons.Various apparatus which form and fill gable top
paperboard cartons are known in the prior art. For
example, the Cherry-Burrell packing machine, Model H-75,
is a standard in the field. The Cherry-Burrell machine
forms a paperboard carton having four sides and a bottom,
partially folds the upper ends of the sides of the carton
into a gable top, fills the carton, and completely folds
and seals the gable top. The Cherry-Burrell machine
operates continuously in an assembly line-type manner,
such that cartons are formed and filled one by one in the
machine at stations which each perform a small task on the
carton in under one second, before the carton moves on to
the next station.Gable top cartons of this type, though, have
disadvantages when they are used to store and dispense
liquid products such as milk, juice, etc. Specifically,
the gable top can often be difficult to open correctly
without accidentally tearing the carton, and, when the top
is reclosed, it fails to provide a liquid-tight closure
and thus allows spillage of the liquid if the carton is
accidentally tipped over or shaken. Accordingly, it has become desirable to place a
releasable closure on a sloping side of the gable top in
place of opening the gable top, wherein the closure is
more easily opened and is liquid-tight when reclosed.
For example U.S. Patent No. 4,669,640 to Ando et al
discloses a method of attaching a mouthpiece 34 to a
gable top carton 20, wherein the mouthpiece is pushed
through an aperture 32 in a sloping side 28 of the gable
top carton 20 such that the mouthpiece 34 is held to the
side 28 by a flange 46 and retainer lugs 48 of the
mouthpiece 34, and wherein the flange 46 is then thermally
or ultrasonically fused to the side 28.U.S. Patent No. 4,813,578 to Gordon et al also
discloses a method of attaching a pour spout 40 to a gable
top carton 10, wherein the spout 40 is first placed on the
open gable top such that a flange 46 overlies an opening
30 in the gable top, and wherein the flange 46 is then
heated and pressed into contact with the gable top such
that the flange 46 adheres to the gable top.Further, U.S. Patent No. 4,909,434 to Jones et al
discloses a method of securing a pouring spout 1 to a
sloping side 2 of a gable top carton,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of attaching a spout (S) to a gable top of a
paperboard carton (C), comprising the steps of:


providing a paperboard blank which is to form a carton (c),
a portion of said blank forming a gable top of the carton,
positioning a spout (S) and said portion of said blank at
predetermined positions relative to one another; further

characterised by the steps of
inserting a stem of said spout longitudinally through a preformed
hole in said article wall and against an inclined

face of a flare tool (72) so that the end portion of said stem (B)
is bent laterally outwardly and into the path of a face of

a staking tool (76) which encompasses said flare tool; and
sliding said staking tool along an outer surface of said
flare tool so that said face of said staking tool bends a

laterally outer section of said bent end portion back against
said article wall while leaving a laterally inner section

of said bent end portion spaced longitudinally from said wall.
A method according to claim 1, wherein said inserting step
comprises inserting a stem (B) of said spout longitudinally

through said hole until a lateral flange of said spout abuts
against a surface of said article wall disposed opposite a

surface of said article wall contacted by said bent end portion.
A method according to claim 2, wherein adhesive is applied
to one of said flange and said article wall to adhesively secure

said flange (F) to said wall.
A method according to claim 1, wherein said inserting step
comprises adhering said spout (S) to a longitudinally

reciprocable applicator by means of air suction, and
longitudinally displacing said applicator toward said hole. 
Apparatus for attaching a spout (S) to a gable top of a
paperboard container comprising:


means for positioning a spout and a portion of a paperboard
blank at predetermined positions relative to one another;
a spout applicator for gripping a spout by suction, said
applicator being longitudinally movable for inserting a stem

of the spout longitudinally through a pre-formed hole in the
blank portion; further characterised by
a flare tool (72) having an inclined face arranged to
contact the stem (B) once the stem passes through the hole,

and bend the end portion of the stem laterally outwardly;
a staking tool (76) encompassing said flare tool and being
slidable relative thereto, said staking tool having a face

(79) arranged to oppose the outwardly bent end portion of the
stem; and
means for sliding said staking tool such that said face of
said staking tool bends a laterally outer section of the

bent end portion of the skirt back against the article wall
while leaving a laterally inner section of said bent end portion

spaced longitudinally from said wall.
Apparatus according to claim 5, wherein said face of said
staking tool (76) includes a radially inner portion of concave

shape defined by a radius of curvature, and a radially outer
portion of generally conical shape extending from a radially

outer end of said inner portion.
Apparatus according to claim 6 including a powered actuator
operably connected to said staking tool for longitudinally

sliding said staking tool, a switch for energizing said actuator,
and means movable with said spout applicator for operating said

switch.
Apparatus according to claim 5, wherein said face of said 
flare tool includes a pair of tapered surfaces arranged coaxially

relative to one another, a radially inner one of said tapered
surfaces defining a first cone angle, and a radially outer one

of said tapered surfaces defining a second cone angle larger than
said first cone angle, said outer tapered surface extending to

an outer periphery of said flare tool.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 5 to 8 including
adhesive applied to one of said flange (F) and said article wall

to adhesively secure said flange to said wall.
