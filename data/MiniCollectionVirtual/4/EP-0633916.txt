<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is an aqueous coating composition that is well 
suited for coating metal surfaces and exhibiting water resistance at 
elevated temperatures. Thus, these compositions are particularly 
adapted to coating cans that are subjected to high temperature 
processes during or after filling. The surfaces of metallic containers intended to contain food 
or beverages are typically coated so as to retard corrosion of the 
container and to improve the appearance of the surface. Food and 
beverage cans are generally made from aluminum, steel, blackplate or 
tinplate steel. These metal containers are subject to air oxidation 
and to corrosive action of the food or beverage products, both of 
which can be accelerated during high temperature pasteurization or 
sterilization processes associated with some canning operations. In order to provide high temperature process resistant 
coatings on cans, the prior art has generally relied on coating 
compositions that contain substantial amounts of organic solvent. 
Volatilization of these organic solvents during the curing of these 
coatings is considered environmentally undesirable, and therefore the 
art has considered it desirable to find water based coatings with the 
required degree of high temperature process resistance. Water based 
coating compositions are generally based on polymeric binders that are 
either water soluble or dispersions in water. Water dispersions 
usually entail synthesis by emulsion polymerization using a surfactant. 
The presence of the surfactant in the film formed from such a coating 
composition degrades the water resistance of the film. An example of 
this type of water dispersion composition is disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,305,859 (McEwan et al.). Water soluble binder systems also 
generally suffer from poor water resistance because of the relatively 
high carboxy group content needed for water solubility. Such 
conventional water based coatings typically soften, blister, or blush  
 
(get hazy due to water absorption) under process conditions, e.g., 
250°F (121°C) steam for 30 minutes. The prior art has attempted to 
improve water resistance of these types of compositions by including 
substantial amounts of aqueous amino resins such as alkoxy derivatives 
of melamine or benzoguanamine, but a disadvantage to that approach is 
typically a loss of film flexibility and the undesirable generation of 
formaldehyde as a product of the curing reaction. Additionally, the 
cross-linking stability provided by these amino resins is less
