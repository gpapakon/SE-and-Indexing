<ABSTRACT>
An endovascular support device (10) for treatment of chronic restenosis or other 
vascular narrowing is disclosed together with a method of manufacture and a 

method for delivering a plurality of such devices to an affected area of a vessel. In 
a preferred embodiment, the endovascular support device comprises a unitary wire-like 

structure configured to form a plurality of upper and lower peaks (12,14) which may 
be compressed for delivery to an affected area of a coronary or peripheral vessel in 

a human, and then expanded to maintain a passageway through the vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to medical devices, and particularly
relates to implantable devices for treating narrowing of coronary or peripheral vessels
in humans.Cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis, is the leading cause of death
in the U.S. The medical community has developed a number of methods for treating
coronary heart disease, some of which are specifically designed to treat the
complications resulting from atherosclerosis and other forms of coronary arterial
narrowing.The most impelling development in the past decade for treating atherosclerosis
and other forms of coronary narrowing is percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty, hereinafter referred to simply as "angioplasty" or "PTCA". The objective 
in angioplasty is to enlarge the lumen of the affected coronary artery by radial
hydraulic expansion. The procedure is accomplished by inflating a balloon within the
narrowed lumen of the coronary artery. Radial expansion of the coronary artery
occurs in several different dimensions and is related to the nature of the plaque.
Soft, fatty plaque deposits are flattened by the balloon and hardened deposits are
cracked and split to enlarge the lumen. The wall of the artery itself is also stretched
when the balloon is inflated.PTCA is performed as follows: A thin-walled, hollow guiding catheter is
typically introduced into the body via a relatively large vessel, such as the femoral
artery in the groin area or the brachial artery in the arm. Access to the femoral
artery is achieved by introducing a large bore needle directly into the femora! artery.
a procedure known as the Seldinger Technique. Once access to the femoral artery
is achieved, a short hollow sheath is inserted to maintain a passageway during
PTCA. The flexible guiding catheter, which is typically polymer coated, and lined with
Teflon, is inserted through the sheath into the femoral artery. The guiding catheter
is advanced through the femoral artery into the iliac artery and into the ascending
aorta. Further advancement of the flexible catheter involves the negotiation of an
approximately 180 degree turn through the aortic arch to allow the guiding catheter
to descend into the aortic cusp where entry may be gained to either the left or the
right coronary artery, as desired.After the guiding catheter is advanced to the ostium of the coronary artery to
be treated by PTCA, a flexible guidewire is inserted into the guiding catheter through
a balloon and advanced to the area to be treated. The guidewire provides the
