<ABSTRACT>
An antibacterial agent containing as the active ingredients a compound selected from the group consisting of a decomposition 
product of lactoferrin, a lactoferrin-related antibacterial peptide and an arbitrary mixture thereof, another specified compound 

and/or an antibiotic; and a method of treating an article with the agent. This agent has an excellent antibacterial effect on 
a wide variety of microbes and is utilizable not only as a drug but also for disinfecting various articles such as food and quasi 

drug safely and efficiently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to antimicrobial agents and method for 
treating products therewith. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to new antimicrobial agents having excellent antimicrobial 
activity against wide variety of microorganisms, and method for safely 
treating various products, e.g., foods, medicines, and the like with 
such an agent. It is known that lactoferrin is a natural iron-binding protein 
occurring in vivo, e.g. in lacrima, saliva, peripheral blood, milk and 
the like, and that it exhibits antimicrobial activity against various 
harmful microorganisms belonging to genera of Escherichia, Candida, 
Closridium, and the like (Journal of Pediatrics, Vol. 94, Page 1, 1979). 
It is also known that lactoferrin exhibits antimicrobial activity, in a 
concentration of 0.5-30 mg/ml, against microorganisms belonging to 
genera of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus (Nonnecke, B.J. and Smith, 
K.L. : Journal of Dairy Science, Vol. 67, page 606, 1984). On the other hand, a number of inventions are known for peptides 
having antimicrobial activity against various microorganisms. Some of 
examples of such peptides are: phosphono-tripeptide (Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Application Gazette No. 57(1982)-106689), phosphono 
dipeptide derivatives (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Gazette 
No. 58(1983)-13594), and cyclic peptide derivatives (Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Application Gazette No. 58(1983)-213744) which are 
effective against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria; peptides 
having antimicrobial and antiviral activities (Japanese Unexamined 
Patent Application Gazette No. 59(1984)-51247); polypeptides effective 
against yeast (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Gazette No. 
60(1985)-130599); glycopeptides derivatives effective against Gram 
positive bacteria (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Gazette Nos.  
 
60(1985)-172998, 61(1986)-251699, 63(1988)-44598); oligopeptides 
effective against Gram positive bacteria (Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Application Gazette No. 62(1987)-22798); peptide antibiotics (Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Application Gazette Nos. 62(1987)-51697, 63(1988)-17897); 
antimicrobial peptides extracted from blood cells of Tachypleus 
tridentalus from North America (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application 
Gazette No. Heisei 2(1990)-53799); antimicrobial peptides isolated from 
hemolymph of bees (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application (via PCT root) 
Gazette No. Heisei 2(1990)-500084), and the like. The inventors of this invention contemplated to
