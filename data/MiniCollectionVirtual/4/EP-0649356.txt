<ABSTRACT>
A founder's black for producing mould coatings is disclosed, whose main component consists of finely ground refractory to highly refractory inorganic materials. The black wash contains 1 to 40 % by weight inorganic hollow spheres, in relation to the ready-to-use black wash. It may further contain 0.1 to 10 % by weight inorganic or organic fibres, in relation to the ready-to-use mould coating. The hollow spheres are preferably filled with an inert gas. They may consist of oxides such as aluminium oxide, quartz, magnesite, mullite, chromite, zircon oxide and/or titanium oxide, of borides, carbides and nitrides such as silicium carbide, titanium carbide, of carbon, glass or metals, or mixtures thereof. The fibres have 1 to 30  mu m diameter, preferably 3 to 10  mu m and 10 to 5000  mu m length, preferably 100 to 500  mu m. When the fibres are inorganic, they may consist of aluminium silicates, aluminium oxide, zircon oxide, titanium oxide, carbon, silicium carbide, titanium carbide, titanium boride, boron nitride, boron carbide, glass, basalt or mineral wool, or mixtures thereof.

spheres are composed of silicates, in particular of 
aluminium, calcium, magnesium and/or zirconium, of oxides 

such as aluminium oxide, quartz, magnesite, mullite, 
chromite, zirconium oxide and/or titanium oxide, of 

borides, carbides and nitrides such as silicon carbide, 
titanium carbide, titanium boride, boron nitride and/or 

boron carbide, of carbon, glass or metals, or are 
mixtures of these hollow spheres.

according to Claim 4, characterized in that the fibres 

are inorganic fibres composed of aluminium silicates, 
aluminium oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium oxide, carbon, 

silicon carbide, titanium carbide, titanium boride, boron 
nitride, boron carbide, glass, basalt or mineral wool, or 

are mixtures of these fibres. 
Refractory wash for producing mould coatings 
according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the 

fibres are organic fibres composed of cellulose, nylon, 
polyethylene, vinyl acetate or polyester, or are mixtures 

of these fibres.
