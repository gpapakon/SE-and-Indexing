<ABSTRACT>
Video system character display device, wherein the characters can be transparently displayed against the normal television image background. The device inserts the text in the orginal video signal and then calculates the weighted average of the signal comprising the text and the original video signal. Application in television sets and peripheral devices.

<CLAIMS>
Device for displaying characters in a video
system including an input terminal receiving a video

signal (CVBS 0) and means (6) for inserting text into
the original video signal (CVBS 0), characterized in

that it further includes means (10, 11) for forming a
weighted average of said original video signal into

which the text has been inserted (CVBS 1) and of the
same original video signal (CVBS 0, CVBS 2), and for

supplying the weighted video signal (CVBS 3) to an
output terminal (13).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it further includes means (5) making it possible

to obtain, on the output terminal (13), either the
weighted video signal or the video signal (CVBS 1) into

which the text has been inserted.
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that said weighted average is formed

when the input signal (CVBS 0) of the device is a
composite, video base band signal or a luminance signal

including synchronization.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said weighted average is

formed at least when the input video signal (CVBS 0) of
the device is a composite video base band signal in

which the chrominance is frequency modulated.
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that said input video signal (CVBS 0) is a signal to

the SECAM standard.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the weighted average is

formed by recovering the weighted video signal at the
mid point (13) of two resistors (10, 11) receiving

respectively the original video signal (CVBS 0, CVBS 2)
and the video signal into which the text to be

displayed has been inserted (CVBS 1).
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it comprises a clamping 

circuit (2) linked to a clamping capacitor (1), the
clamped signal feeding two circuit branches in

parallel, one of these branches including a character
generator (7) inserting the text to be displayed into

the original video signal (CVBS 0) of this first
branch, the other branch including a "tri-state"

control (5).
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the insertion of text

into the video signal is performed by a text generator
(7) inserting luminance plateaux corresponding to the

text to be displayed.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it comprises a

synchronization reinsertion circuit of known type.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the weighting

coefficients are 3/4 for the original video signal into
which the text has been inserted (CVBS 1) and 1/4 for

the original video signal (CVBS 0, CVBS 2).
Device according to Claim 10, characterized in
that the 3/4 and 1/4 coefficients are used for signals

to the PAL or NTSC standards.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the weighting coefficients are

2/3 for the video signal into which the text has been
inserted and 1/3 for the original video signal.
Device according to Claim 12, characterized in
that the 2/3 and 1/3 coefficients are used for signals

to the SECAM standard.
