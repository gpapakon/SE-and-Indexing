<ABSTRACT>
A well having a casing intersecting a subsurface 
formation is modified by inserting a hydraulic jetting tool 

(200) into the casing, forming a plurality of openings 
through the casing, and directing a plurality of hydraulic 

jets from the hydraulic jetting tool (200) so that each of 
the hydraulic jets is directed through a corresponding one 

of the openings. A plurality of fan-shaped slots are cut 
substantially simultaneously in the subsurface formation in 

a plane substantially transverse to a longitudinal axis of 
the casing. The well jetting tool (200) comprises jetting 

means (410A, 410B, 410C, 410D) in a housing (360) for 
jetting a plurality of fluid streams from the housing (360), 

and drive means for pivoting the jetting means (410A, 410B, 
410C, 410D) such than each of the streams describes a fan-shaped 

pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
modifying an oil or gas well by a fracturing operation, and 
more particularly to a method of cutting fan-shaped slots in 
a formation in a plane substantially perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis of the well. Several different techniques are currently used 
for the completion of horizontal wells. A first, very common manner of completing a 
horizontal well is to case and cement the vertical portion 
of the well and to leave the horizontal portion of the well 
which runs through the producing formation as an open hole, 
i.e. that is without any casing in place therein. 
Hydrocarbon fluids in the formation are produced into the 
open hole and then through the casing in the vertical 
portion of the well. A second technique which is commonly used for the 
completion of horizontal wells is to place a length of 
slotted casing in the horizontal portion of the well. The 
purpose of the slotted casing is to prevent the open hole 
from collapsing. A gravel pack may be placed around the 
slotted casing. The slotted casing may run for extended 
lengths through the formation, for example as long as 1.61km 
(one mile). A third technique which is sometimes used to 
complete horizontal wells is to cement casing in both the 
vertical and horizontal portions of the well and then to 
provide communication between the horizontal portion of the  
 
casing and the producing formation by means of perforations 
or casing valves. The formation may also be fractured by 
creating fractures initiating at the location of the 
perforations or the casing valves. In this third technique, the formation of 
perforations is often done through use of explosive charges 
which are carried by a perforating gun. The explosive 
charges create holes which penetrate the side wall of the 
casing and penetrate the cement surrounding the casing. 
Typically, the holes will be in a pattern extending over a 
substantial length of the casing. When the communication between the casing and the 
producing formation is provided by casing valves, those 
valves may be like those seen in US-A-4949788 (Szarka et 
al.), US-A-4979561 (Szarka), US-A-4991653 (Schwegman), US-A-5029644 
(Szarka et al.) and US-A-4991654 (Brandell et al.). 
Such casing valves also provide a large number of radial 
bore type openings communicating the casing bore with the 
surrounding formation. When utilizing either perforated casing or casing 
valves like those just described, the fracturing fluid 
enters the formation through a

A method of modifying a well (10) having a casing
