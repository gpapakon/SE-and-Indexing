<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a culture medium for cultivating 
mushrooms whose material can be selected from a variety of 

woody materials and which can be transported in a compact 
form. There is also provided a method of cultivating 

mushrooms using such a culture medium in which pathogenic 
and other germs are less likely to breed and with which 

mushrooms can be cultivated in shorter periods. After 
adding nutrients such as rice a
nd wheat brans, a mixture of 
dried sawdust and chip dust is heated at 150 - 300°C for 1 

- 5 minutes under a pressure of 1.0 - 3.0 t/cm² to form a 
cylindrical woody culture medium. The medium thus obtained 

is allowed to swell by adding water and then sterilized by 
sealing it in a bag. Mushroom fungi is then inoculated 

into it.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of cultivating 
mushrooms and a woody culture medium therefor. In general, the term "mushroom" does not refer to a 
taxonomical unit but to basidiomycetes and ascomycetes 
forming large fruit bodies or to fruit bodies themselves. In order to grow such edible mushrooms as Flammulina 
velutipes, Pleurotus ostreatus, Hypsizigus marmoreus, 
Pholiota nameko, and Grifola frondosa, it is known to use a 
culture medium containing such nutrients as sawdust, rice 
bran and wheat bran. Before inoculating a mushroom spawn 
to the culture medium, it is put in a plastic bag or a 
glass container, sterilized for one hour at 120°C under the 
pressure of 1.2 atm. in a high-pressure sterilizing oven 
(autoclave), and then cooled. Now, this technique is also 
employed in growing Lentinus edodes. This method is superior to the conventional one in 
which mushroom spawns are inoculated on logs, because it 
saves a lot of labor and permits a planned mass-production 
of mushrooms. Thus, this technique is now widespread. But this method in which saw dust or the like is used 
as a culture medium, it takes a long time to sufficiently 
mature saw dust for use as nutrients for fungi. Thus the  
 
productivity is low and the cost too high. Further, wood of conifers from which saw dust is 
produced, contain some growth inhibitors for mycelium such 
as terpene than do broad-leaved trees. Further, the speed 
at which such saw dust is decomposed and the mycelium is 
matured is rather slow. Its use is thus difficult. 
Actually, saw dust of conifers such as Cryptomeria japonica 
is used together with an excessive amount of nutrients as a 
substitute for broad-leaved trees. But because such a 
culture medium contains an excessive amount of nutrients, 
pathogenic germs such as Trichoderma and other various 
germs such as green mold tend to grow. An object of this invention is to provide a method of 
cultivating mushrooms in which various kinds of materials 
including both coniferous and broad-leaved trees can be 
used as the woody materials for a culture medium and which 
makes it possible to reduce the size of such culture medium 
for easy transportation, to prevent the growth of 
pathogenic and other germs, and to cultivate mushrooms in 
short periods. According to this invention, there is provided a 
method of cultivating mushrooms comprising the steps of 
forming a culture medium comprising as main components 
water and woody materials heated at 150 - 300°C for 1 - 5 
minutes under the pressure of 1.0
