<ABSTRACT>
An electronic organizer is provided that incorporates an internal electronic scanner and a touch sensitive display screen to enter text and image data. The internal electronic scanner permits both machine generated text and image data to be scanned and directly entered into the electronic organizer. Hand-printed text data is also entered directly via the touch sensitive display screen using a stylus or pen. The scanned machine generated text, the scanned image data and the hand-printed text can either be preserved as an image-oriented bit map, or optical character recognition routines can be applied to the data to identify characters and convert the identified characters to computer coded text data. Data entered into the electronic organizer is arranged in a relational database format, which permits the operator to quickly and easily enter and retrieve related information between a number of different databases with a minimal amount of effort. A small document transport mechanism is provided to aid in the scanning of small size documents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to compact 
electronic organizers that are capable of storing 
information (for example schedule information, telephone 
numbers, memos, etc.) commonly used by individuals on a 
day-to-day basis. More specifically, the invention is 
related to a compact electronic pocket organizer that is 
capable of entering and storing personal information in 
the form of both text and image data in a manner that 
permits the information to be quickly and easily 
correlated between a plurality of databases when entered 
and retrieved. A wide variety of compact electronic organizers are 
currently available that permit an operator to enter 
various information related to the operator's personal 
schedule and business contacts. For example, the WIZARD 
(Tm) series of hand-held electronic organizers available 
from the Sharp Electronics Corporation includes a 
keyboard and display that permits the operator to enter 
schedule information, telephone numbers and memos for 
later review and retrieval. The operator can also create 
a business card file in which information related to a 
number of business cards can be stored, sorted and 
retrieved. A primary drawback of the type of electronic 
organizer described above is the method in which 
information is entered and subsequently retrieved by the 
operator. Specifically, the operator is forced to use a 
very small keyboard to enter text data as the electronic 
organizer is designed to be of a compact or "pocket" 
size. Many individuals find the small keys on the 
keyboards to be difficult to use and may therefore  
 
experience a large number of errors when trying to enter 
or retrieve information. Attempts have been made to overcome the problem of 
small keys by having the operator use an input stylus to 
activate the keys or buttons on the keyboard. While the 
stylus does make it easier for the operator to select a 
desired key, the overall data entry operation using the 
stylus is very slow as the operator must use a "hunt and 
peck" approach to enter data. Thus, the transfer of data 
from various source materials into the organizer, for 
example the transfer of name, address, company name and 
telephone number from a business card to a business card 
file within the organizer, becomes a very tedious and 
time consuming operation. Another disadvantage in the method of entering data 
in conventional organizers is that, in many instances, 
the same data must be re-entered in a number of different 
databases. For example, it may be desirable

a document transport mechanism (38) for grasping and 
transporting the document along a transport path past the 

scanning means (26); 
processing means (60,62) for retrieving the data 
entered into the memory unit; and 
display means (14) for displaying the retrieved data; 
 
   characterised in that: 


said device is an organiser; and 
said retrieved data comprise both image data from said scanning 
means (26) and text data;
 
and 
said document transport mechanism (38) is arranged for 
grasping a document in response to a user placing it into a gripping means (28, 41) and transporting the document along said 

transport path in response to a user moving the organiser
