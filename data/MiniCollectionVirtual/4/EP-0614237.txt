<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a structure etc. of battery for 
use in fields of electronic equipment, toy and accessory etc. As shown by Fig. 40 and Fig. 41, conventional batteries 
201 and 202 had a fixed shape such as rectangular or circular. 
Therefore, a battery could not be installed conveniently in 
an excessive space of an electronic circuit because a shape 
of battery could not be changed when using the battery for 
driving the electronic circuit, so that a space for installing 
the battery was provided in a separate position. For this 
reason, a dead space occupied in the electronic equipment 
became large and a size of the entire equipment increased. 
When an attempt was made to manufacture a battery having a 
shape adapted to an excessive space of an electronic circuit 
in order to solve this problem, a production process and 
production facility such as a metal mold etc. should be 
changed according to respective shapes of batteries so that 
a manufacturing cost of battery increased. Further, when manufacturing a large number of coin type 
batteries 203 for example, they were made up scatteringly as 
shown by Fig. 42. For this reason, control and 
transportation after that were extremely troublesome.  
 This invention was made in consideration of the above 
problems. An object of this invention is to obtain a battery 
of voluntary shape and further to make easy control and 
transportation of the obtained battery. In the first place, this invention provides a battery 
precursor for producing a battery through a cutting process 
in order to easily obtain a battery of voluntary shape. The battery precursor of this invention is characterized 
in that a large number of battery elements comprising positive 
active material layers, separators having electrolytes and 
negative active material layers are installed in parallel 
between a plate-like positive current collector plate and a 
negative current collector plate facing each other, and the 
respective battery elements are partitioned each other and 
sealed by insulators. When this battery precursor is used, 
a battery of voluntary shape can be obtained easily by only 
cutting it. Further, since batteries having various shapes 
can be obtained from the battery precursor having the same 
structure, it is not required to change a production process 
of the battery precursor in case when obtaining a battery of 
any shape, so that a production cost of battery can be 
reduced. In the above battery precursor, structures of following 
items (1) to (4) may
