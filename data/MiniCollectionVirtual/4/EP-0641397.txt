<DESCRIPTION>
 STEEL FOR BALL AND ROLLER BEARINGSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a steel for ball and roller bearings and similar applications.2. Description of the Prior Art Ball and roller bearings have to withstand high loads under extended periods of time and at temperatures that may temporari¬ ly rise to 250°C. Many times they are working in contaminated environments and thus must withstand abrasion by hard and abra¬ sive particulate material. Further, ball and roller bearings must have high dimensional stability and reproducibility while at the same time being as easy as possible to manufacture.Known in the art are various kinds of steel, which are used or have been suggested for use in the production of ball and roller bearings, components thereof, and for similar applica- tions.One steel widely used for ball and roller bearings is SAE 52100, containing 0.98 - 1.10 % C, 0.15 - 0.35 % Si, 0.25 - 0.45 % Mn, max. 0.025 % P, max. 0.025 % S, 1.30 - 1.60 % Cr, and max. 0.10 % Mo. The strength of the steel, which is a mechanical property of major importance, is high and this steel results in ball and roller bearings of good mechanical properties, but still there is a need for even higher quality steel for manufac¬ turing ball and roller bearings.A further need is to accomplish a steel resulting in good mechanical properties while at the same time being improved wit regard to ease of hot working, reproducibility of product pro¬ perties such as dimensional stability and long life under high- load conditions, where resistance against fractures caused by fatigue and wear are important factors.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONOne object of the invention is to provide an improved steel for ball and roller bearings with improved functional properties 

compared to prior art steels.Another object of the invention is to provide an improved steel for ball and roller bearings with improved manufacturing properties.These objects are achieved with the steel for ball and rol bearings and similar applications according to the invention containing, in % by weight:Carbon Silicon ManganeseChromium 

 Molybdenum the rest up to 100% being iron and other residual elements normally present in steel, and with the further proviso that the total area percentage of oxide inclusions must not exceed 0.0012 %, that the area per¬ centage of titanium-carbonitrides must not exceed 0.0015 %, an that the area percentage of sulphide inclusions must not excee 0.030 %, the respective area percentages being measured
