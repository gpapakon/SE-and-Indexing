<ABSTRACT>
A tape cassette having a cassette case; a pair 
of tape reels rotatably mounted in the cassette case, on 

which tape reels a magnetic tape is wound, each of the 
tape reels having a flange formed with an outer 

circumferential toothed portion; a slide housing slidably 
mounted in the cassette case and having a hollow portion 

into which a reel unlocking member provided in a recording 
and/or reproducing apparatus is inserted when the tape 

cassette is loaded into the apparatus; and a pair of lock 
members adapted to releasably engage with the toothed 

portions of the tape reels, respectively, to lock the tape 
reels, the lock members being independently rotatably 

mounted on the slide housing; whereby when the reel 
unlocking member is inserted into the hollow portion of 

the slide housing, the slide housing is slid toward an 
unlock position to rotate the lock members and thereby 

disengage the lock members from the toothed portions of 
the tape reels, thus unlocking the tape reels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a tape
cassette, and more particularly to a tape cassette
capable of reliably locking a pair of tape reels on
which a tape is wound and also capable of preventing
slack of the tape.In a tape cassette having a cassette case and a
pair of tape reels rotatably contained in the cassette
case, on which tape reels a recording medium such as a
magnetic tape is wound, it is necessary to lock the tape
reels in an inoperative condition of the tape cassette,
so as to prevent the magnetic tape from being unduly
unwound from the tape reels. In an 8 mm tape cassette
to be used in an 8 mm video tape recorder (VTR), for
example, as disclosed in EP-A-0146311,
a slide housing having lock members far locking
the tape reels is slidably mounted in the cassette case
so as to be moved in frontward and rearward directions
of the cassette case. The slide housing is resiliently
biased in such a direction that the lock members lock 
the tape reels, and each lock member is integrally
formed with a lock pawl engaging with a toothed portion
formed on an outer circumference of a flange of each
tape reel, thus locking the tape reels to prevent undue
rotation of the tape reels. When the tape cassette is
loaded into the VTR, a reel unlocking member provided in
the VTR is inserted into the cassette case through a
hole formed through a bottom wall of the cassette case,
thereby moving the slide housing against a biasing force
applied thereto to disengage the lock pawls of the lock
members from the toothed portions of the tape reels,
thus unlocking the tape reels.In the above-mentioned 8 mm tape cassette in the
related art, the lock members are integrally formed on
the front end of the slide housing, so that the lock
pawls of the lock members come into engagement with the
toothed portions of the tape reels in a last stage of a
stroke of movement of the slide housing during a locking
operation. Accordingly, the tape reels cannot almost be
rotated in tape winding directions by the lock members
during the locking operation. That is, the lock members
have no effect of winding the tape in case of slacking
of the tape. Although such an effect of winding the
tape can be obtained by increasing the stroke of 
movement of the slide housing, the increase in the stroke
causes a hindrance to a reduction in size of the tape
cassette. Further, in the event that one of the two tape
reels is rotated in the tape slacking direction by any
shock to the tape cassette, both the lock members are moved
away from the

<CLAIMS>
A tape cassette comprising:

a cassette case (2);
a pair of reels (8,8') rotatably mounted in said
cassette case (2), each of said reels (8,8') having a

flange (11,11') formed with an outer circumferential
toothed portion (12,12');
a magnetic tape (7) wound around said reels;
a slide member (25) adapted to slide in frontward and
rearward directions within said cassette case (2) for

locking said reels (8,8');
a pair of lock members (42,42') provided on the slide
member (25) and adapted to engage with said toothed

portions (12,12') of said reels (8,8'), respectively, to
lock rotation of said reels (8,8') in opposite directions

of slacking of said magnetic tape;
a first spring (52) for biasing said lock members
(42,42') to rotate in such directions as to engage with

said toothed portions (12,12') of said reels (8,8');
a second spring (41) for biasing said slide member
(25) to slide said slide member (25) in said frontward

direction; wherein
said lock members (42,42') are independently
rotatably mounted on said slide member (25); 
a pair of cam members (24,24') are provided for
rotating said lock members (42,42') in such directions as

to disengage from said toothed portions (12,12') of said
reels (8,8'), respectively, against a biasing force of

said first spring (52) when said slide member (25) is slid
in said rearward direction; characterised in that each of

said lock members (42,42') has a projection (45,45')
formed in the vicinity of a centre of rotation thereof,

and said slide member (25) has a pair of stopper ribs

(39,39') adapted to engage with said projections (45,45')
of said lock members (42,42'), respectively, thereby

inhibiting undue rotation of said lock members (42,42')
prior to installation of said slide member and said lock

members.
