<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a security paper having a security element in the form of a thread or tape which consists of a translucent plastic film having at least partially opaque coating. The security element has at least one first opaque coating and a translucent region adjoining this opaque coating, as well as items of information which extend from the first opaque coating into the translucent region.

An antifalsification paper having a security element in the form of a thread
or band which consists of a transparent plastic film with an at least partly opaque

coating and bears information in the form of visually and/or machine readable characters
or patterns, characterized in that the security element (2) has at least one first

opaque coating (4) and at least one transparent area bordering on the opaque coating,
the first opaque coating (4) being a periodic screen from any geometrical figures and

the transparent area (3) being formed by the coating-free spaces, and the information
(5) extends over several opaque areas (4) and transparent areas.
An antifalsification paper having a security element in the form of a thread
or band which consists of a transparent plastic film with an at least partly opaque

coating and bears information in the form of visually and/or machine readable characters
or patterns, characterized in that the security element (2) has at least one first

opaque coating (4) and at least one transparent area (8) bordering on the opaque
coating, and the information (7, 9) extends both into the opaque coating (4) and into

the transparent area (8) and the portions of information disposed in the transparent
area (8) are represented by a second opaque coating (7).
An antifalsification paper according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
information portions disposed in the first opaque coating (4) are present there in the

form of gaps (5, 9).
An antifalsification paper according to claim 1, characterized in that the
opaque coating (4) is a periodic striped pattern disposed at a certain angle to the running

direction of the security element.
An antifalsification paper according to claim 4, characterized in that the
striped pattern extends at an angle of 0° or 45°.
An antifalsification paper according to claim 2, characterized in that the second
opaque coating (7) has the same screen pattern and the same orientation as the

first opaque coating (4).
An antifalsification paper according to claim 2, characterized in that the first
opaque coating (4) is a stripe extending parallel to the running direction of the security

element. 
An antifalsification paper according to claim 2, characterized in that the first
opaque coating (4) comprises two areas disposed parallel to the running direction of

the security element and separated by the transparent area (8) likewise disposed parallel
to the running direction of the security element.
An antifalsification paper according to claim 2, characterized in that the first
opaque coating (4) and the transparent area (8) are formed as bars disposed in

checkered arrangement along the running direction of the security element (2).
An antifalsification paper according to at least one of claims 1 to 9, characterized
in that the first and/or the second opaque coating (4, 7) is a metalization or

a metallic-looking ink.
An antifalsification paper according to at least one of claims 1 to 10, characterized
in that the second opaque coating (7) has a different inherent color from

the first.
A security element to be embedded in an antifalsification paper in the form
of a thread or band which consists of a transparent plastic film with an at least partly

opaque coating and bears information in the form of visually and/or machine readable
characters or patterns, characterized in that the security element (2) has at least

one first opaque coating (4) and at least one transparent area bordering on the
opaque c
oating, the first opaque coating (4) being a periodic screen from any geometrical
figures and the transparent area being formed by the coating-free spaces,

and the information (5) extends over several opaque areas (4) and transparent areas.
A security element to be embedded in an antifalsification paper having a
security element in the form of a thread or band which consists of a transparent

plastic film with an at least partly opaque coating and bears information in the form
of visually and/or machine readable characters or patterns, characterized in that the

security element (2) has at least one first opaque coating (4) and at least one transparent
area (8) bordering on the opaque coating, and the information (7, 9) extends

both into the opaque coating (4) and into the transparent area (8) and the portions of
information disposed in the transparent area (8) are represented by a second opaque

coating (7).
