<ABSTRACT>
A solid state process for the bulk conversion of 
a dense polycrystalline ceramic body to a single 

crystal body has been accomplished by heating the 
polycrystalline material to a temperature above one-half 

of the melting temperature of the material but 
below the melting point of the material. As the 

process is a solid state process, no melting of the 
ceramic body is necessary to convert it to a single 

crystal. The process has been used to convert a dense 
polycrystalline alumina body (PCA) containing less than 

100 wppm of magnesia to sapphire (single crystal 
alumina) by heating the PCA to temperatures above 

1100°C but below 2050°C, the melting point of alumina.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid state process
for bulk conversion of a polycrystalline ceramic body
to a single crystal body by heating the polycrystalline
body to temperatures above one-half the melting
temperature of the material but below the melting
temperature of the material. More particularly, this
invention relates to a solid state process for the bulk
conversion of polycrystalline alumina (PCA) to a single
crystal alumina (sapphire). The solid state conversion
of PCA to sapphire is accomplished by heating a PCA
body containing less than 100 wppm of magnesia to a
temperature above 1100°C but below 2050°C, the melting
point of alumina. No melting of the PCA body is 
necessary to obtain the conversion.The manufacture of Lucalox® alumina, type of
polycrystalline alumina (PCA), and its use for high
pressure sodium arc discharge lamps (hereinafter "HPS
lamps") is well known and old to those skilled in the
art. U.S. Patents 3,026,210; 4,150,317 and 4,285,732,
respectively, to Coble, Laska et al and Charles et al,
disclose the production of a high density PCA body
having improved visible light transmittance using
relatively pure alumina powder and small amounts of
magnesia. U.S. Patent 4,285,732 further teaches adding
zirconia and hafnia to the magnesia-doped alumina to
reduce the chances of precipitating a second phase and
exaggerated or run away grain growth during sintering.
PCA bodies useful for HPS lamps have been made
according to the process in these patents having an
average grain size ranging between 15 microns to 100
microns. Two major drawbacks associated with the use
of PCA arc tubes for HPS lamps are firstly that they
are light translucent as opposed to light transparent
and secondly, that the sodium in the arc reacts with
the alumina at the PCA grain boundaries to form sodium
aluminate, which shortens lamp life. HPS lamps are
being designed for increased sodium partial pressure
within the PCA arc tube to improve the color rendition
and provide a whiter emitted light. However, higher
sodium pressure further shortens lamp life due to
sodium loss from the arc chamber. Progressive sodium
loss results in a rise in the lamp operating voltage,
a decrease of both correlated color temperature and
color rendering index, and a color shift from white to
pink. Also, the sodium which migrates through the arc 
chamber wall deposits on the inside wall of the
evacuated outer lamp envelope causing a brownish stain
on the envelope which, in turn, further reduces the
light output of the lamp. These
