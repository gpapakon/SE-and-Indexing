<ABSTRACT>
A camshaft assembly comprises a metal camshaft 8 
having a cam piece 2 constructed of a ceramic 

material, a cam follower 4 and a cam journal piece 9, 
the surface roughness Ra of this cam piece not 

exceeding 0.1 µm, and the Vickers hardness of this cam 
piece being not less than 1000 kg /mm². The ceramic 

material of the cam piece 2 also preferably has a 
modulus of longitudinal elasticity of not less than 

25000 kg /mm². The camshaft assembly permits 
reduction of kinetic losses by reducing frictional 

losses due to sliding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a camshaft assembly 
used in a valve train such as an internal combustion 
engine. In recent years, fuel cost savings have become an 
important issue in the automobile industry due to the 
need to save natural resources and conserve the global 
environment. One approach toward this goal is to 
improve the thermal efficiency of automobile engines 
by making car bodies more lightweight and running 
engines on leaner fuel mixtures, while another is to 
reduce mechanical losses in engines. Current methods 
now being studied to reduce mechanical losses in the 
valve train systems of an engine are mainly directed 
toward making parts more lightweight with a view to 
reducing their inertial mass, and reducing frictional 
torque due to sliding. FIG. 1 shows different valve trains used in 
engines. In the figure, A shows a direct drive 
system, B a swing arm system, C a rocker arm system 
and D a projecting rod system. "OHC" and "OHV" 
represents "overhead camshaft" and "overhead valve", 
respectively. Of these valve trains, the OHC system 
is most widely used due to its excellent valve 
movement characteristics from the viewpoint of engine 
performance.  
 FIG. 2 is a horizontal section of a typical OHC 
direct drive valve train. In FIG. 2, reference 
numeral 1 is an engine cylinder head, 2 is a cam, 3 is 
a valve lifter, 4 is a cam follower, 5 is an 
intake/exhaust valve, 6 is a valve seat, and 7 is a 
valve spring. In FIG. 2, the valve lifter 3 is 
driven by the cam 2 so as to transmit the displacement 
of the cam 2 to the intake/exhaust valve 5. As can be seen from FIG. 2, the cam and cam 
follower possess surfaces which slide against each 
other. The contact pressure between these surfaces is 
extremely high, and particularly, under engine running 
conditions in the low engine speed region such as when 
the engine is running idle, this sliding occurs when a 
lubricant oil film has not completely formed. 
Consequently, the frictional losses due to the action 
of the valve train represent a significant proportion 
of the total frictional losses in the engine which 
cannot be ignored. Further, as lubrication is 
inadequate, cam damage due to wear, scarfing and 
pitching is a serious problem. Recently, multi-valve systems and variable valve 
timing mechanisms have been used in an effort to 
improve intake/exhaust efficiency in automobile 
engines, however due to increasing spring loads, and 
to the fact that sufficient cam width cannot be 
maintained to accommodate these mechanisms in
