<ABSTRACT>
An FPGA architecture and method enables partial reconfiguration of selected configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected to an address line without affecting other CLBs connected to the same addressl line.  Partial reconfigutration at a memory cell resolution is achieved by manipulating the input voltages applied to the address and data lines of the FPGA so that certain memory cells are programmed while other memory cells are not programmed.  In addition, partial reconfiguration at at CLB resolution can be achieved by hardwiring the FPGA to enable selection of individual CLBs for reconfiguration.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ARCHITECTURE AND METHOD FOR PARTIALLY RECONFIGURING AN FPGATECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to integrated circuits, particularly programmable logic devices or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) . More particularly, this invention relates to techniques for partially reconfiguring sections of an FPGA without affecting other sections of the FPGA.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are configured to perform particular functions by loading a stream of bits, or bitstream, into a memory that controls configuration of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) . Each CLB includes configurable logic, horizontal and vertical line segments that connect across adjacent cells to form interconnect lines, and a routing or switching structure to selectively connect the logic to the line segments. It is sometimes desirable to change the functionality of the FPGA by reconfiguring some or all of the logic blocks. In the past, reconfiguration involved reprogramming the entire FPGA by loading a complete new bitstream into the FPGA to reconfigure all of the CLBs . As FPGAs have grown rapidly in size, partial reconfiguration techniques have evolved to enable reconfiguration of selected portions of the FPGA without affecting other portions of the same FPGA. Due to the architecture of FPGAs, however, partial reconfiguration has been traditionally limited to reconfiguring entire columns of memory for controlling CLBs.Fig. 1 shows an FPGA 20 to illustrate the limitations of conventional partial reconfiguration. The FPGA 20 has an array of tiles, each tile comprising configurable logic and related interconnect, which are collectively referred to as a configurable logic block (CLB) 22. For illustration purposes, only a few CLBs are shown in Fig. 1 and only a few of the interconnect lines have been drawn. 

Typically, an FPGA 20 is implemented with thousands of repeatable CLBs 22, each having many horizontal and vertical line segments. Young, Chaudhary and Bauer in U.S. Patent 5,914,616 describe such a structure in more detail. Each CLB 22 has configurable logic, horizontal and vertical line segments that connect across adjacent cells to form interconnect lines, and a routing or switching structure to selectively connect the logic to the line segments . Configuration of the logic and connection between line segments is controlled by a configuration memory, into which a configuration is loaded for enabling the logic and interconnect lines to perform a desired function. In some FPGAs, data in the

CLAIMS
1. A method for partially configuring a field programmable gate array (FPGA) , the FPGA having an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected by multiple address lines and multiple data line pairs, the method comprising: reconfiguring one or more first CLBs addressed by at least one address line; and simultaneously preventing reconfiguration of second CLBs addressed by the address line.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the step of preventing reconfiguration comprises selectively reconfiguring the first CLBs by applying first data values to complementary data line pairs connected to the first CLBs and second data values to the complementary data line pairs connected to the second CLBs .
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the FPGA also has a plurality of mask lines, each of which serves at least one of the data line pairs, the reconfiguring comprising applying a first value to the mask lines associated with the data line pairs that are to receive the first data values and applying a second value to the mask lines associated with the data line pairs that are to receive the second data values .
4. The method of Claim 3 wherein the FPGA further comprises a register associated with each of the mask lines, the register storing a mask bit that indicates whether to configure a row corresponding to the associated mask line. 

5. The method of claim 1, wherein the FPGA also has a plurality of local address lines for each of the at least one address line, and logic to connect the address line to corresponding local address lines, the reconfiguring comprising selecting one or more of the local address lines to access the first CLBs independently of accessing the second CLBs .
6. A method for partially configuring a field programmable gate array (FPGA) , the FPGA having multiple configurable logic blocks (CLBs) , multiple address lines, multiple complementary data line pairs, at least one local address line for each of the address lines, a word control line for each word of configuration data, and logic to connect the word control lines and the address lines to corresponding local address lines, the method comprising: selecting one or more word control lines and one or more address lines to access selected words; and deselecting one or more word control lines to prevent access to deselected words addressed by the address line.
7. A field programmable gate array (FPGA) programmed as a result of the method of claim 6.
8. A field programmable gate array (FPGA), comprising: an array of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) , each CLB having at least one local address line and multiple data lines; and an addressable data register to receive programming data for programming the CLBs via the data lines.
9. The FPGA of claim 8, further comprising a second register connected to the addressable data register to temporarily hold the programming data so that the data register is free to receive more programming data.
