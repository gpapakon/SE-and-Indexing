<ABSTRACT>
In a process of signature verification, an off-line test signature is
compared to one or more on-line reference signatures. Dynamic data obtained from

the reference signature or signatures may be used to improve the thinning of the test
signature. Such data may also be used for segmenting the test signature and

sequencing the resulting strokes. In some embodiments, the invention includes
evaluating a dynamic error, based at least in part on such sequencing of the test

signature. In some further embodiments, the invention includes producing a
rendering of at least one on-line reference signature as a two-dimensional image, and

evaluating a static error based, at least in part, on shape-matching between the
rendered image and the test signature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to methods for verifying human signatures.
More specifically, this invention pertains to methods that involve comparing a
scanned test signature to an on-line reference signature obtained during an
enrollment procedure.All methods of signature verification involve comparing one or more
test signatures to one or more reference signatures that are stored in a database.
Often, a reference signature is used that is an average or composite of a set of
signatures entered during an enrollment procedure. Methods of signature
verification fall generally into two categories. In so-called off-line, or static,
methods, the test and reference signatures are treated as static two-dimensional
images, and they are compared, using techniques of shape analysis, without
reference to dynamic information. Techniques of shape analysis include those based
on spatial transforms, such as the fast Fourier transform, Karhunen Loeve transform
(KLT), and wavelet techniques. Generally, these and similar techniques are used to
extract numerical values of certain predefined features. Error scores are calculated,
expressing the difference in value that each feature has between the test signature
and the reference signature. Some criterion is provided for rejecting the test
signature if its total error score, which takes into account some or all of the
individual errors, is too high. A useful discussion of static methods of signature
verification can be found in F. Leclerc and R. Plamondon, "Automatic Signature
Verification: The State of the Art - 1989-1993," Int. J. of Pattern Recogn. And Art.
Intellig. 8, Special Issue: Automatic Signature Verification, J. Plamondon, Ed.,
World Scientific Publishing Company (June 1994) 643-660.In so-called on-line, or dynamic, methods of signature verification, each
signature is treated as a temporally sequenced set of points that lie on a two
dimensional (2-D) plane. Raw data are provided, as noted below, by a sampling and
digitizing device. Algorithms for smoothing the raw, digitized signature are
generally employed in order to provide a curve suitable for subsequent analysis. In
some dynamic methods of signature verification, features are evaluated and cross-compared
between the test and reference signatures. These features may include
various purely spatial characteristics such as first and second moments (in the x,y-plane), 
as well as dynamic characteristics such as average velocities, accelerations,
and derivatives of acceleration. A useful discussion of methods of this
