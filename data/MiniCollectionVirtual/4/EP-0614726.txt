Grinding machine, especially for abrading concrete and natural stone, 
having a milling ring provided with abrasive wheels, 
wherein
 said 
abrasion wheels (2) are affixed rigidly in an axial direction to the heads of 

bolts (3) and that said bolts (3) are screwed into said milling ring (1) in an 
axial direction and are accessible from the side of the abrasion wheels. 
Grinding machine according to claim 1, 
wherein
 said milling ring (1), 
in the direction of view of the motor axis, is right-hand driven and said 

bolts (3) have a right-hand thread. 
Grinding machine according to claim 1 or 2, 
wherein
 said bolts (3) are 
disposed at the same distance from the motor axis and are equidistant to 

one another. 
Grinding machine according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein
 there are 
hexagonal bolt heads. 
Grinding machine according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein
 the 
diameter of said abrasion wheels (2) is smaller than the diameter of the 

bolt heads.  
 
Grinding machine according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein
 there is 
a welded and/or sintered and/or soldered joint between said abrasive 

wheels (2) and bolt heads. 
Grinding machine according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein
 said 
bolts (3) are screwed into pocket holes (5) and that between the bolt 

head and the milling ring (1) said sealing ring (6) is disposed. 
Grinding machine according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein
 an axial 
cooling water supply is disposed in milling ring (1). 
Use of a grinding machine according to one of claims 1 to 8 for the 
surface working of a workpiece, whereby the workpiece is machined 

successively with abrasive wheels of differing coarseness, 
wherein
 after 
the surface working with said abrasive wheels (2) of a certain 

coarseness, bolts (3), which are connected to the abrasive wheels (2), 
are unscrewed from said milling ring (1) and bolts (3) provided with 

abrasive wheels (2) of lower coarseness are screwed into said milling 
ring (1).  

 
Use of a grinding machine according to claim 9, 
wherein
 said bolts 
(3) are unscrewed with worn out abrasive wheels (2) and replaced by 

bolts (3) with unused abrasive wheels (2).
