<ABSTRACT>
Copolymers containing incorporated radicals of long-chain alcohols and neutralised carboxyl groups are suitable for use as retans for leather. They produce an excellent combination of hydrophobicity, softness and firm grain.

(C) a base,

20 to 80% of the carboxyl groups corresponding to
the anhydride groups of the terpolymer being

esterified with alcohol (B) and at least 20% of the
remaining carboxyl groups being neutralized with

base (C), as retanning agent for leather.
Use according to Claim 1, wherefor monomer c) is
selected from the series consisting of styrene,

Î±-methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene, vinyl acetate,
allyl acetate, isobutyl vinyl ether, allyl alcohol,

methyl alcohol and mixtures thereof.
Use according to Claim 1, wherefor 30 to 75% of the
carboxyl groups corresponding to the anhydride

groups of the terpolymer have been esterified with
alcohol B.
