<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a mesh reinforcement, in which the main bars (1) of the mesh reinforcement, said main bars (1) being of normal ribbed bar, are fed parallelly and step-wise to a welding station (2) at a controlled distance from each other, and its transverse reinforcements (3) are placed at the welding station (2) individually in position on top of the main bars (1) and welded together with these. The invention is characterized in that the welding of the transverse reinforcements (3) is performed with two spot welding heads (4), whose actuators (6) are located on the opposite sides of the welding station (2), which welding heads may be controllably transferred in the transverse direction of the mesh reinforcement along the transverse reinforcement (3) to be welded and which are arranged to stop automatically at each main bar (1) within its moving area and to perform there the spot welding function.

<DESCRIPTION>
 -- - -- !- A method for manufacturing a mesh reinforcementThe present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a mesh reinforcement, in which the main bars of the mesh reinforcement, said main bars being of normal ribbed bar, are fed parallelly and step-wise to a welding station at a controlled distance from each other, and its transverse reinforcements are placed, at the welding station, indivi¬ dually in position on top of the main bars and welded together with these.Previously, mesh reinforcements were usally welded such that each transverse reinforcement was welded simultaneous¬ ly together with all main bars by using a long welding brush, which extended across the entire mesh reinforcement. Such a method makes very large demands upon the uniformity of the reinforcement bars, and its power requirement is extremely high. Due to this matter, it has previously been possible to use only a normal rod wire with a cross-section of 12 mm at the highest, which does not provide a suffi¬ cient strength for concrete structures in all conditions. In spite of the rod wire, the contact between the transver¬ se reinforcements and the main rods is relatively uncer¬ tain, which results in that the transverse reinforcement is not properly welded together with all main rods.The method according to the invention for manufacturing a mesh reinforcement is characterized in that the welding of the transverse reinforcements is performed with two spot welding heads, whose actuators are located on the opposite sides of a welding station, which welding heads may be controUably transferred in the transverse direction of the mesh reinforcement along the transverse reinforcement to be welded together and which are arranged to stop automatical- ly at every main bar within its moving area and to perform there the spot welding function. Since a considerably thick 

 ribbed bar may be used, a sufficient strength is obtained for the concrete structures by means of a simple reinforce¬ ment at the same time as it is ensured that the transverse reinforcement will certainly fix to every main bar. By means of the invention, it is possible to industrially manufacture such mesh reinforcements provided with strength properties, which cannot have been previously manufactured economically.The other characteristics of the invention are presented in the enclosed claims 1 to 7.The invention is next described in more detail with refe¬ rence to the accompanying drawing, in whichFig. 1 is a principle view of an equipment to be utilized in the
