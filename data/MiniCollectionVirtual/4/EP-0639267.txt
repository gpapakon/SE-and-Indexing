<ABSTRACT>
A lamp for emitting ultraviolet light and illuminating objects for inspection purposes, such as detecting oil leakages in jet engines. The lamp comprises a reflector (1), a light source (2) for emitting ultraviolet light, and a filter (3) for filtering-out light within the visible spectrum. The invention is characterized in that the light source (2) is comprised of a gas discharge tube having an electrode distance of less than 5 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Lamp for Transmitting Ultraviolet LightThe present invention relates to an ultraviolet lamp.•I 5 More specifically, the invention relates to a lamp of the kind used to detect oil leakages in jet engines, among other things.Oil will fluoresce when illuminated with ultraviolet 10 light and such lighting is therefore used to detect oil leakages in jet engines, among other things, oil leakages from other sources are also traced with the aid of ultraviolet lighting.15 Ultraviolet light is also used in other determining contexts, for instance to determined between different types of rock.A known oil leakage detecting lamp includes a parabol- 20 ic reflector and a conventional gas discharge tube or bulb, which has an electrode distance of 30 to 70 mm. The use of such a tube renders the lamp very large and awkward.25 One problem with the known lamp is that focusing of the light becomes poor because of the large electrode distance. In turn, this means that the wattage of the tube must be as high as 110 W. Despite this high wattage, it is necessary to hold the lamp close to the 30 object concerned, as close as 30 cm or even closer, in order to enable oil leakages in jet engines to be "* detected, for instance. This makes it very difficult> to handle the lamp, particularly when the inspection i or control needs to be carri.ed out i.n confi.ned spaces.35The present invention solves these problems and pro¬ vides a lamp which is compact, easy to operate and effective. 

The present invention thus relates to a lamp which emits ultraviolet light and is intended for illuminat¬ ing objects for inspection purposes, such as for detecting oil leakages in jet engines, said lamp including a reflector, a light source which emits ultraviolet light, and a filter for filtering-out light within the visible spectrum, said lamp being characterized in that the light source is comprised of a gas discharge tube having an electrode distance of less than 5 mm.The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to an exemplifying embodiment thereof and also with reference to the accompanying drawing, the Figure 1 of which is a schematic longitudinal section view of an inventive lamp.Figure 1 illustrates a lamp for emitting ultraviolet light and intended for irradiating objects for inspec- tion purposes, such as to detect oil leakages in jet engines. The lamp includes a reflector 1, a light source 2 for emitting ultraviolet light, and a filter 3 for filtering-out light within the visible spectrum. The filter 3 is suitably
