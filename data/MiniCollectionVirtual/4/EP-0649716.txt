<ABSTRACT>
Cutter to form diaphragm joints in the production of 
concrete panels (14) cast in position in trenches (11) 

excavated in the ground (30), the cutter (10) cooperating 
with the trench (11b) adjacent to the last panel (14a) cast 

so as to form in the transverse wall (13) of that panel 
(14a) a vertical joint profile (12a), the cutter (10) 

comprising a cutting assembly (17) associated with a thrust 
and guide assembly (18), the cutting assembly (17) and the 

thrust and guide assembly (18) being positioned 
longitudinally opposite to each other on a supporting frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a cutter to form diaphragm joints, 
as set forth in the main claim. The cutter to form diaphragm joints according to the 
invention is applied to the field of constructions and in 
particular to the making of diaphragms consisting of a 
plurality of concrete panels cast in position in the 
excavations or trenches made in the ground, these panels 
being suitably joined together. The cutter to form diaphragm joints according to the 
invention is employed in particular for the trimming and re-working 
of the terminal transverse wall of the cast panel 
and creates at the same time a joint profile suitable for 
connection to the adjacent panel to be cast. In the field of constructions and in the specific field of 
the production of diaphragms consisting of a plurality of 
panels placed side by side and joined together, the state of 
the art at present arranges to excavate a trench for each 
single panel and to cast a concrete panel therein after a 
trench of a determined depth has been made. In particular, so as to optimise the procedure and to 
reduce the production times, the state of the art arranges 
to cast a panel in the trench made after a determined number 
of adjacent excavations. When the trench has been made, supporting equipment of a 
determined shape is caused to cooperate with the initial and 
final transverse walls of the excavation and has the purpose 
of creating a profile of a joint in the respective 
transverse walls of the panel which is cast in the trench. This joint profile has the purpose of ensuring a strong 
seal-engagement connection with the adjacent panel which 
will be cast thereafter.  In fact, the problem is to form a joint between one panel 
and the adjacent panel, the joint being such as will ensure 
a proper seal engagement of the joint and a continuous 
nature of the diaphragm thus cast. The supporting equipment of the state of the art used for 
this purpose consists of abutment tubes or sheet piles, 
which are also called "organ-pipe tubes". These abutment tubes may be of a cylindrical type or may 
have a different profile, depending on requirements. The abutment tubes are inserted into the excavation with 
one face in contact with the initial or terminal transverse 
wall of the trench and with their other face facing towards 
the trench to be filled. In view of the different depths of the trenches the 
abutment tubes have to be coupled together as they are 
inserted into the ground until they reach the length 
necessary to cover the whole depth of
