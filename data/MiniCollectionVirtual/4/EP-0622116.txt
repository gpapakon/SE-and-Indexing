<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for introducing a 
stream of fluid into a fluid mass to rapidly attain uniform radial 
fluid distribution, and to an apparatus therefor. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for 
introducing fluidized solid particles into a bed of fluidised 
solids particles, for example for introducing catalyst particles 
into a fluidized bed of catalyst particles such as is present in 
the regenerator or reactor of a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) 
reactor to rapidly attain uniform radial distribution of introduced 
solids, and to an apparatus therefor. Fluidized catalytic cracking processes operate by circulating 
catalyst particles continuously from a reactor in which a 
hydrocarbon feed is cracked to lower boiling products, during which 
cracking carbonaceous material is deposited on the catalyst, via a 
regenerator in which the carbonaceous material is combusted to 
restore the catalyst activity, and returning catalyst particles to 
the reactor. Temperature of combustion in the regenerator is 
locally dependent on the amount of carbonaceous material on the 
catalyst and the supply of combustion gas in a given region. Whilst operation with a single catalyst inlet opening at the 
regenerator side wall has for many years been satisfactory, the 
benefit to be obtained by improving radial distribution in 
conventional processes has become apparent. The benefits available 
from improved distribution of catalyst are particularly apparent 
for units comprising a regenerator vessel of increased diameter or 
in which regeneration is conducted at relatively high temperatures. 
Such is the case for example with the processing of residual feeds 
or where limited elevation space or specific operation mode require 
operation with a reduced regenerator fluid bed height, combined  
 
with a large bed diameter. A condition for optimum regeneration is 
that the time for radial mixing of catalyst be less than that for 
coke combustion. With relatively high regeneration temperatures and 
heavier feed processing the rate of coke combustion is increased, 
requiring decrease in radial mixing time. With increase in diameter 
of a fluid bed, catalyst distribution must be more effective to 
prevent corresponding increase in radial mixing time. Should this 
condition not be met, radial gradients of coke, combustion gas and 
temperature form within the bed leading to an increase in oxygen 
content of flue gas and afterburn and a decrease in coke burning 
capacity for a given air
