<ABSTRACT>
A camera system is disclosed that optically records 
audio information on a photographic film containing 

corresponding image information. The camera system 
includes a user interface coupled to a camera control 

processor (34), a recording circuit coupled to the camera 
control processor (34) and a microphone (20), an optical encoding 

circuit (38) having an input coupled to the output of the 
recording circuit and an output coupled to an optical 

write head (30), a shutter mechanism (24), and transport means (48) for 
advancing film past the shutter mechanism and the optical 

write head (30). In operation, the camera control processor (34), 
in response to command signals received from the user 

interface (14), controls the operation of the recording 
circuit, the optical encoding circuit (38), the optical write 

head (30), the shutter mechanism (24) and the transport mechanism (48), 
to record audio segments of variable duration and to 

encode the audio segments as an audio film frame at a 
location adjacent to the last picture film frame as the 

transport means advances film past the optical write 
head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to
apparatus for optically recording audio information on
photographic film. More specifically, the invention
relates to a photographic still camera that records audio
information corresponding to a plurality of picture film
frames in an audio film frame located adjacent to the
last picture film frame.Image information systems have recently been
introduced in which photographic film images are scanned
and stored in digital form on optical compact storage
discs (CD's) for subsequent reproduction and display.
The optical storage discs can be utilized to store audio
information as well as image information. It is
therefore desirable to provide a system in which audio
information corresponding to the photographic film image
is recorded when the photographic image is exposed, so
that the photographic film image and the recorded audio
information can subsequently be stored together on the
storage disc.One approach to recording audio information related
to a photographic image would be to provide a camera with
a sound recording system that records the audio
information on an audio storage medium. The sound
storage medium could take the form of a magnetic tape, a
magnetic information storage disc, or a semiconductor
memory that can be detached from the camera and sent with
a film roll to a processing facility. The processing
facility would then develop the film image, scan the film
image to create digitized image data, and store the
digitized image data on the storage disc. The audio
information contained on the sound storage medium 
corresponding to the film roll would also be recorded
onto the storage disc.There are a number of problems associated with the
use of a separate audio recording medium to record the
audio information as described above. The complexity and
expense of the photographic camera system, for example,
increases due to the requirement of providing a separate
audio recording medium within the camera structure. The
audio recording medium can also become separated from the
photographic film at several different points in the
overall process, thereby requiring that a tracking system
be employed to insure that the audio recording medium and
photographic film are properly mated prior to recording
the image and audio information on the storage disc.In view of the difficulties associated with the use
of a separate recording medium, it is an objective of the
invention to provide a camera system that records the
audio information directly on the photographic film

A photographic still camera (10) comprising: a camera
control processor (34); a user interface (14) coupled to the camera

control processor (34); a microphone (20); a recording circuit (36)
coupled to the camera control processor (34) and the

microphone (20); an optical write head (30); an optical encoding
circuit (38) having an input coupled to the output of the

recording circuit (36) and an output coupled to the optical
write head (30); a shutter mechanism (24); a display unit (18); and

transport means (48) for advancing film past the shutter
mechanism (24) and the optical write head (30); wherein:


the camera control processor (34) is arranged to, in response to command
signals received from the user interface (14), control the

operation of the recording circuit (36), the optical encoding
circuit (38), the optical write head (30), the shutter mechanism (24)

and the transport means (48),
and expose a plurality of picture film

frames;
characterised in that :

said camera control processor (34) is arranged to record audio segments of
variable duration and determine the length of film required to encode

the cumulative recorded audio segments; after each
picture is taken, determine whether sufficient film

remains to expose another picture frame and also encode
the audio segments and, if not, display on the display

unit (18) a message to the user to indicate further exposures
are unavailable; and encode the audio segments as an

audio film frame adjacent to the last picture film frame of
the plurality of picture film frames as the transport

means (48) advances film past the optical write head (30).
A camera (10) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the camera
control processor (34) is further operative to disable the camera

shutter mechanism (24) prior to entering into an audio encoding mode
when it is determined that insufficient film remains to

allow another picture frame exposure.
A camera (10) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
optical write head (30) is located between the shutter

mechanism (24) and a film cartridge storage slot (22) of the
camera (10). 
A photographic filmstrip comprising: a plurality of
adjacent picture film frames and an encoded audio film frame

located adjacent to the last picture film frame of the
plurality of picture film frames; characterized by:


the audio film frame including encodements for a
plurality of audio segments that correspond to the

plurality of picture film frames, and the length of the
audio film frame

being different from the length of the picture film frames and
determined by the duration of the

audio segments encoded in the audio film frame.
A film scanner for scanning a photographic film

therefrom; and processing means (56) for receiving the output
signal from the scanning means (52), identifying audio segments of the audio film frame, and converting the output,

signal to a digital signal representative of a picture film
frame and its corresponding audio segment for re-recording
