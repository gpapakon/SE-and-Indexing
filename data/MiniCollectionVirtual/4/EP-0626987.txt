<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to coatable mixtures including erodable filler 
agglomerates, and abrasive articles incorporating cured versions of same. The 
erodable filler agglomerates, in one preferred form, comprise cryolite particles and 
aluminum sulfate. The abrasive articles can be coated abrasives, nonwoven 
abrasives or bonded abrasives. Abrasive articles generally comprise abrasive grains secured within a 
binder. In the case of a bonded abrasive, the binder serves to bond the abrasive 
grains together such that they form a shaped mass. Typically, this shaped mass 
is in the form of a wheel and thus it is commonly referred to as a grinding wheel. 
In the case of coated abrasives, the binder serves to bond the abrasive grains to a 
substrate or backing, and the binder may be comprised of make and size coatings. 
In the case of nonwoven abrasives, the binder serves to bond the abrasive grains 
to a lofty, open, fibrous substrate. In many abrasive articles the binder includes a particulate filler. Typically, 
the binder will comprise between 40 to 70 percent by weight particulate filler. 
The addition of the filler either increases the toughness and hardness of the binder 
and/or reduces the cost of the finished article, e.g., by decreasing the amount of 
binder required. There exists a subclass of fillers, referred to as grinding aids, cutting aids, 
or generically as "active fillers". An active filler is typically a particulate material 
the addition of which to the binder has a significant affect on the chemical and 
physical processes of abrading which leads to improved performance. In general, active fillers are most efficient when used in a dry grinding 
mode. The mechanism of wet grinding is much different than dry grinding. 
Active fillers such as cryolite (Na₃AlF₆) generally do not function as effectively 
in the wet grinding mode. For equivalent amounts of stock removal, grinding may  
 
be done at increasingly higher forces, eventually leading to dulling of the abrasive 
article through degradation of the binder and/or abrasive grain pullouts. Abrasive 
product dulling may also occur as a result of the abrasive grains being worn to the 
make coating level. Thus, an unmet need exists in the abrasives art, particularly in the art of 
wet grinding, for an active filler that provides for a controlled erosion of the 
abrasive layer during grinding, which results in a continuous exposure of the 
working abrasive grains, a slower increase in the required grinding force, and 
prolonged life of the
