<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to antibiotics, which are called salmycins,
derivatives thereof, to a process for the preparation thereof and to their use as a
pharmaceutical.Known iron containing antibiotics, socalled sideromycins, are ferrimycin [M.
Bickel et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 43 (1960) 2105, albomycin [G. Benz et al.,
Angew. Chem. 94 (1982) 552], ferrocine [B. Katayama et al., J. Antibiotics 46
(1993) 65] and danomycin [P. Huber et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 69 (1986) 236].
These antibiotics show high in vivo activities. However, they exhibit severe
disadvantages. The activity of ferrocin is restricted to pseudomonas strains.
Danomycin is not stable. Albomycin can be produced only in small yields.Surprisingly, iron containing antibiotics were found, which do not exhibit the
disadvantages of the known compounds and can be easily produced. The
compounds according to the invention consist of an iron chelate and an amino-disaccharide-part,
which is an amino-disaccharide group consisting of a keto-glucose
and an amino-heptose-unit. Formula I shows the complete structure of
salmycin A, B, C and D and other salmycins.The salmycins show a high antibacterial activity, in particular against gram-positive
bacteria. Since the activity mechanism of salmycins and their
derivatives differs from that of conventional antibiotics, they are valuable
pharmaceuticals, in particular in cases where resistances of gram-positive
bacteria occur.Accordingly, the subject of the instant invention are compounds of formula I 

wherein
R denotes = NOH (a), =O (b); -OH and -H (c), -NH2 and -H (d) or =N-O-R'(e),R' denotes phenyl or alkyl,R'' denotes H, alkyl, hydroxy-alkyl and amino-alkyl,
as well as the chemical equivalents and physiologically acceptable salts thereof.R in formula I is either double-bonded (cases a, b and e) or stands for a single
bonded substituent and a H-atom (cases c and d).The term alkyl comprises a branched or unbranched carbon chain preferably
with 1 to 10 carbon atoms. In the case of R' in formula I, the alkyl contains
preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, in particular 1 to 3 carbon atoms. If R'' in
formula I contains an alkyl component, the alkyl contains preferably 3 to 6
carbon atoms, in particular 4 to 5 carbon atoms.For the salmycins A - D - the particularly preferred compounds - the
substituents have the following denotations:
salmycin A: R = NOH, R'' = -(CH2)5-OH,salmycin B: R = O, R'' = -(CH2)5-OH,salmycin C: R = O, R'' = -(CH2)4-OH,salmycin D: R = NOH, R'' = -(CH2)4-OH.The term chemical equivalents and
