<ABSTRACT>
Reaction of amine-containing substrates with hydrogen peroxide can suffer from certain problems, especially in the presence of transition metals. These problems include both in situ generation of impurities and particularly nitrosamines, which are allegedly carcinogenic, and also impaired product formation. The problems can be ameliorated by employing in the reaction mixture free radical scavengers, including in particular phenols and polyhydroxy-substituted aromatic compounds. The scavengers are advantageously employed in conjuction with a metal chelating agent such as polycarboxylic acid or an organopolyphosphonic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Inhibition of the Formation of Nitrosa ines The present invention relates to a process for the inhibition of the formation of nitrosamines during the reaction of a compound containing an amine functionality, and in particular from secondary or tertiary amines. Background to the present invention Compounds containing an amino functionality can be oxidized with hydrogen peroxide, sometimes with an additive such as a catalyst in order to promote the reaction or sometimes in the absence of a catalyst, depending on the inherent reactivity of the substrate. Many papers or patents describe variations to the reaction between amines and hydrogen peroxide. For example, US Patent Specification no 4 247 480 to Nissan Che Ind KK suggests the addition of a chelating agent selected from EDTA or stannate together with carbonic acid or a carbonate.Disadvantageously, however, there is a tendency for nitrosamines to be formed as byproducts in reaction mixtures which contain amines, particularly secondary or tertiary amines and hydrogen peroxide. This is inevitably the case during reaction between those two reactants but it can also occur if such an amine is itself a reaction product or intermediate. For example, when tertiary amines are being converted to amine oxides by reaction with hydrogen peroxide, there is a distinct tendency for nitrosamines to be produced as a byproduct. The formation of nitrosamines is disadvantageous for several reasons, of which the most significant identified to date is the fact that many nitrosamines are carcinogenic. At least some of the nitrosamines are quite volatile, so that either in the course of the reaction or subsequently during storage or use of the main product, such volatile nitrosamines can be released into the atmosphere and thus can be inhaled by persons in the vicinity. They can be absorbed through the skin by dermal contact. This can be particularly significant 

for some amino derivatives such as amine oxides, in that one of their major uses is in personal hygiene products, such as shampoos or cleansing lotions which are skin contact products. Consequently, it is highly desirable to find ways of inhibiting the formation of such carcinogenic byproducts to preserve the health of chemical process operators and any subsequent user of the products.As a second disadvantage, though of rather less importance, a number of the byproduct nitrosamines are brightly colored, such that their presence, even in low amounts, tends to impart that color to the main product. If as is the case
