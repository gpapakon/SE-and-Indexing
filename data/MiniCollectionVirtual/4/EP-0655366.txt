<ABSTRACT>
The inclined ramp has a corrugated structure (2) formed of grooves (3) and of projections (4) and an articulated free end shaped into a plurality (9) of pivoting fingers (10-12) the width, thickness and separation of which allow them to retract entirely inside the grooves (3). This invention relates to the field of road transport and more particularly vehicle transporters.

<CLAIMS>
Ramp for access to the rear end of a vehicle-transporter
lorry unit for the loading and unloading of the

vehicles comprising two ends, characterized in that its
body is constituted by a rectangular format (1) having a

corrugated upper surface consisting of a transverse
alternation of channels (3) and of projections (4) and in

that one of the ends is shaped according to a plurality (9)
of fingers articulated so as to pivot onto the body of the

ramp.
Ramp according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the body of the ramp is a corrugated steel sheet (2).
Ramp according to Claim 2, characterized in that
the shape of the corrugation of the corrugated steel sheet

(2) is that of indentations delimiting the channels (3) and
projections (4) in the form of high and low areas which

succeed one another transversely.
Ramp according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the spacing and the width of

the fingers (10-12) are arranged so that they fit into the
channels (3) when folded back into the inactive position

against the body of the ramp.
Ramp according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the fingers (10-12) are

chamfered at their free end.
Ramp according to Claim 5, characterized in that
the fingers (10-12) are chamfered on their lower faces.
Ramp according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the thickness of the fingers

(10-12) is such that they remain below the upper plane (16)
of the ramp formed by the succession of projections (4).
Ramp according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the fingers (10-12) are 

movable simultaneously.
Ramp according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the fingers (10-12) are movable

individually.
Ramp according to claim 9, characterized in that
a single finger or two fingers are used.
