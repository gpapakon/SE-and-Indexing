<ABSTRACT>
The holding device can be attached by clamping to a table top or a wall and serves to hold rods, tubes or the like, in particular to hold a sun umbrella. It contains a bar element (2) in an H-shape and a receiving ring (16) which can be fitted on, two parallel limbs (3, 4) of the bar element (2) receiving a plate between them in the position of use and being clampable on said plate with the aid of a fixing screw (6). The receiving ring (16) has the shape of a circlip with two radially projecting flanges (17) which bound a gap (1) and by means of which the ring can selectively be fitted onto one of the free limbs (9 or 10) or onto the cross-web (8) of the bar element (2) and can be locked on the bar element (2) by means of a retention. The device can be used for numerous different applications, either in the household or in the garden or for leisure pursuits, for holding rods or tubes.

A holding device for bars, tubes or the like, in particular for a
sun umbrella, which has a yoke element (2) for fitting on to a table edge

and a fixing screw (6), wherein two parallel limbs (3, 4) in the position
of use receive a plate or the like between them and can be braced by

means of the fixing screw (6) which is mounted in a screwthreaded bore
(5) in a limb (3), the holding device further includes a receiving ring

(16) for receiving a bar which can be braced in the receiving ring (16),
and the yoke element (2) and the receiving ring (16) are independent

individual parts, wherein the receiving ring (16) is formed substantially
like a pipe clamp with two substantially radially projecting flanges (17)

which define a gap (18), characterised in that the yoke element (2) is
shaped substantially like the letter 'H' and that the flanges (17) can be

fitted selectively on to one of the free limbs (9 or 10) or on to the
cross bar portion (8) of the yoke element (2) and can be locked to the

yoke element (2) by means of an arresting arrangement.
A holding device according to claim 1 characterised in that the
free limb (9) of the yoke element (2), which extends in line with the

screwthreaded bore (5), is in the form of a double-T-profile member with
a web portion (12) which is disposed transversely with respect to the

axis of the bore and that the oppositely disposed free limb (10) and in
part the cross bar portion (8) are also in the form of double-T-profile

members, but with the web portion (13 and 14 respectively) extending
parallel to the axis of the bore.
A holding device according to claim 2 characterised in that the
flanges (17) of the receiving ring (16) are of such a thickness that they can

be pushed on to the double-T-profile members from the ends thereof and
individually lie in positively locking engagement in a respective passage

in the profile member. 
A holding device according to claim 2 or claim 3 characterised in
that provided on the web portions (12, 13 or 14 respectively) of the

double-T-profile members are arresting means such as successive bores
(12.1, 13.1 or 14.1 respectively) or teeth.
A holding device according to claim 4 characterised in that
mounted in bores (31) in the flanges (17) of the receiving ring (16) is a

displaceable, spring-loaded arresting pin (32) which in the position of
use of the rec
eiving ring (16) engages in positively locking engagement
into a bore (12.1, 13.1 or 14.1) or between two teeth.
A holding device according to one of claims 2 to 5 characterised
in that the cross bar portion (8) of the yoke element (2) is prolonged

beyond the lateral limbs (4, 10) at the side remote from the
screwthreaded bore (5) by a projection (11).
A holding device according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised
in that at its end, in line with the screwthreaded bore (5), the limb (9)

has a V-shaped groove (27) with edges parallel to the plane of its web
portion (12).
A holding device according to claim 6 or claim 7 characterised in
that the projection (11) and the free limb (10) disposed at that side

have at their end a respective V-shaped groove (29 and 28 respectively)
with edges extending parallel to the plane of the associated web portion

(14 and 13 respectively).
A holding device according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised
in that a clamping screw (21) is mounted on the receiving ring (16) in a

radial screwthreaded bore (20) which is in diametrally opposite
relationship to the flanges (17) and that a pressure stirrup (23) of U-shape

is freely rotatably mounted on the clamping screw (21) at its
rearward end at which it carries a small hand wheel, the limbs (25) of 

the stirrup extending on both sides of the receiving ring (16) and at
their free ends each having a respective V-shaped groove (26) with edges

extending parallel to the axis of the ring.
A holding device according to one of claims 5 to 9 characterised
in that formed on a flange (17) of the receiving ring (18) is a lateral

projection (30) on which the arresting pin (32) is mounted in a
transverse bore (31).
