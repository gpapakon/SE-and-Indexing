<ABSTRACT>
A phase plate (230) adapted for use with an optical sensor 
module (200) for an inkjet printer/plotter (10) equipped with 

a photodetector (240) to sense a test pattern (40) having a 
plurality of horizontally spaced bars or vertically spaced 

bars and a photodetector (240). The inventive phase plate is 
in optical alignment with the photodetector and is constructed 

of opaque material. The phase plate includes a plurality of 
apertures horizontally spaced therein. The spacing between the 

apertures is equal to the spacing between the horizontally 
spaced bars in said test pattern (40). In the alternative, the 

plate may include a plurality of apertures ((242) vertically 
spaced therein. In this case, the spacing between the 

apertures is equal to the spacing between the vertically 
spaced bars in the test pattern (40). In a particular 

implementation, the phase plate (230) includes both 
horizontally spaced apertures and vertically spaced apertures. 

In this case, the horizontal spacing between the apertures is 
equal to the spacing between the horizontally spaced bars in 

the test pattern (40) and the spacing between the vertically 
spa
ced apertures is equal to the spacing between the 
vertically spaced bars in the test pattern (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printers and 
plotters. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to inkjet printers and plotters having multiple 
pens for multi-color operation. Inkjet printer/plotters, such as those sold by 
Hewlett Packard Company, offer substantial improvements 
in speed over the conventional X-Y plotter. Inkjet 
printer/plotters typically include a pen having an array 
of nozzles. The pens are mounted on a carriage which is 
moved across the page in successive swaths. Each inkjet 
pen has heater circuits which, when activated, cause ink 
to be ejected from associated nozzles. As the pen  
 
is positioned over a given location, a jet of ink is 
ejected from the nozzle to provide a pixel of ink at 
a desired location. The mosaic of pixels thus created 
provides a desired composite image. Inkjet technology is now well known in the art. 
See, for example, U. S. Patents Nos. 4,872,027, entitled 
PRINTER HAVING IDENTIFIABLE INTERCHANGEABLE HEADS, issued 
October 3, 1989, to W. A. Buskirk et al. and 4,965,593, 
entitled PRINT QUALITY OF DOT PRINTERS, issued October 
23, 1990, to M. S. Hickman. Recently, full color inkjet printer/plotters have 
been developed which comprise a plurality of inkjet pens 
of diverse colors. A typical color inkjet 
printer/plotter has four inkjet pens, one that stores 
black ink, and three that store colored inks, e.g., 
magenta, cyan and yellow. The colors from the three 
color pens are mixed to obtain any particular color. The pens are typically mounted in stalls within an 
assembly which is mounted on the carriage of the 
printer/plotter. The carriage assembly positions the 
inkjet pens and typically holds the circuitry required 
for interface to the heater circuits in the inkjet pens. Full color printing and plotting requires that the 
colors from the individual pens be precisely applied to 
the media. This requires precise alignment of the 
carriage assembly. Unfortunately, mechanical 
misalignment of the pens in conventional inkjet 
printer/plotters results in offsets in the x direction 
(in the media or paper axis) and in the y direction (in 
the scan or carriage axis). This misalignment of the 
carriage assembly manifests as a misregistration of the 
print images applied by the individual pens. In 
addition, other misalignments may arise due to the speed 
of the carriage, the curvature of the platen and/or spray  
 
from the nozzles. One conventional approach for aligning the pens 
involves the use of optical drop detectors. This 
technique is
