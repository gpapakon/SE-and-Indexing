<ABSTRACT>
Various optical amplifier configurations are 
disclosed. In one configuration, an optical amplifier 

provides an amplified output signal through use of a 
pumping device. The output signal is split to an output 

and a feedback input. The feedback signal is converted 
to a current which is sensed by a controller. The 

controller adjusts the amount of current to the pumping 
device in various instances. In one instance, the 

current is controlled to prevent overdriving the pumping 
device. In another instance, the current is controlled 

to maintain the output signal at a substantially constant 
level. In another configuration, the optical amplifier 

is coupled to a ratio computation block which measures 
the operating efficiency of the pumping device. 

Additional components detect an undesirable efficiency 
and provide a warning of the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to optical
amplifiers, and more particularly to an optical amplifier
configuration having a feedback system for maintaining a
substantially constant amplified output and a detection
circuit for preventing overdrive of the amplifier pump. Improvements in optical amplifiers have vastly
enhanced the use of optical communication systems by
increasing both data rates and the distances over which
optical signals are transmitted. One significant
advancement in such amplifiers is the development of
optical amplifiers based on an optic fiber doped with a
rare-earth element. This type of amplifier eliminates
the need for complicated regenerator or "repeater"
devices used in conventional systems to regenerate
attenuated signals. Conventional repeaters require
complex electronics to convert light into electric
signals, amplify the signal, recover the data from the
amplified signal, and then transform it back into light.
In contrast, doped-fiber optical amplifiers do not
interrupt the light signal, but merely add energy to it
as described below. The components in the optical
amplifier system are comparatively simple.Figure 1 illustrates a block diagram of a prior art
optical amplifier designated generally at 10. The block
diagram is a simplified illustration of commercially
available amplifiers, such as the FiberGain™ Module
available from Corning Incorporated of Corning, New York,
and identified as part number CL-10. Amplifier 10
includes an optical fiber 12 which is doped with a rare-earth
element. In the preferred embodiment, the dopant
is erbium. Other elements, such as neodymium, also have
been used as dopants for the fiber, but erbium remains as
the most prominent and successful. Optical fiber 12
provides an input 14 for receiving a light input signal,
LIN, and an output 16 for providing an amplified light
output signal, LOUT1. While not shown, optical fiber 12 is
typically wound around a spool or like device.Amplifier 10 further includes a light sourcing
device which is typically a laser diode 18. While not 
shown, laser diode 18 is commonly housed in a small
metallic case. Laser diode 18 couples power to the
amplifier by "pumping" energy into optical fiber 12 and,
hence, is also known as a pump laser diode.
Specifically, the light provided by laser diode 18 is
absorbed by the erbium atoms in fiber 12, pumping those
atoms to a high-energy level. When a weakened LIN signal
enters fiber 12, the excited erbium atoms transfer their
energy to the signal in a process known as
