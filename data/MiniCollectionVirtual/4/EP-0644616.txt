<ABSTRACT>
The hermaphroditic contact, having a flat and substantially rectangular shape, comprises, on one side, a terminal springy arm and, on the other side, a so-called main insulation-displacement shank (fork). It is characterised in that the main insulation-displacement shank (4) is open opposite each springy arm (3A, 3B). Application: disconnectable connection.

<CLAIMS>
A hermaphrodite contact that is flat and substantially 
rectangular in shape, comprising at least one resilient terminal arm 

and a "main" insulation displacement fork, the contact being 
characterized in that the main insulation displacement fork (4; 14; 

24) has an access opening (7) situated facing the terminal portions 
of the resilient arms (3A, 3B; 13A, 13B; 23A, 23B) and extends from 

said access opening towards a first end (2; 12; 22) of said contact, 
opposite from the terminal portions of the arms. 
A contact according to claim 1, characterized in that it also 
comprises another "branch" insulation displacement fork (19, 29), 

which is open on said first end of the contact. 
A contact according to claim 2, characterized in that said main 
and branch forks are substantially aligned and extend axially along 

the contact. 
A contact according to any of claims 1 to 3, constituted by two 
blades placed against each other and united along the first end edge 

of the contact and is provided with two resilient terminal arms 
extending towards an opposite end edge, said resilient arms each 

being part of one of the blades and extending on respective sides of 
the longitudinal axis of the contact, the contact being characterized 

in that it also includes two deep U-shaped splits (5A, 5B; 15A, 15B; 
25A, 25B) each formed in a respective one of the blades (1A, 1B; 11A, 

11B; 21A, 21B) and extending towards said first end edge of the 
contact, and which are partly superposed over one another so as to 

define said main insulation displacement fork and said access 
opening. 
A connection defined by coupling together first and second 
contacts according to claim 4, the connection being characterized in 

that the resilient arms (13A, 13B) of said first contact (10, 10') 
also partly overlap one other on either side of said longitudinal 

axis of the first contact, while the resilient arms (23A, 23B) of the 
second contact (20, 20') are set back from the longitudinal axis of  

 
the second contact, to leave between them a gap corresponding 

substantially to the overlapping portions of the resilient arms of 
the first contact. 
A connection according to claim 5, characterized in that in each 
blade of each of said first and second contacts, one of the sides of 

the slot defines a curved transition region (7A, 7B; 17A, 17B; 27A, 
27B) in the corresponding resilient arm and the other side of the 

slot defines a truncated branch (6A, 6B; 16A, 16B; 26A, 26B) of the 
corresponding blade. 
A connection according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
truncated branches of one only of said first and second contacts 

constitute stops for the resilient arms of the other of said 
contacts, when these contacts are coupled to each other.
