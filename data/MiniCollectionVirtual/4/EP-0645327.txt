<ABSTRACT>
Hopper (20) for supplying flat objects, comprising a substantially planar sole plate (26) delimited by a first so-called falling edge (24) adjacent to means (14, 17) for conveying flat objects in a predetermined conveying direction (Da) and by a second so-called gripping edge (6) comprising means (7) for attracting the first object (1) in a pile of flat objects (1, 8, P) located on the said sole plate (26) against the said second edge (6) and displacing this object (1) towards transfer means (16) in a predetermined transfer direction (Dt). The sole plate (26) comprises a first part (27), adjacent to the falling edge (24), and a second part forming a retention zone (21) located close to the said gripping edge (6) and having a high coefficient of friction much greater than that of the first part (27) of the sole plate (26). Use for automatic sorting of mail.

<CLAIMS>
Magazine (20) for feeding flat objects comprising a 
substantially plane baseplate (26) delimited by a first or 

drop edge (24) adjacent means (14, 17) for routing flat 
objects in a predetermined routing direction (Da), 

characterised in that it comprises a second or handling 
edge (6) comprising means (7) for drawing against said second 

edge (6) the first object (1) from a stack of flat objects 
(1, 8, P) on said baseplate (26) and moving said object (1) 

towards transfer means (16) in a predetermined transfer 
direction (Dt), said baseplate (26) comprising a first part 

(27, 28, 29) adjacent the drop edge (24) and a second part 
forming a retention area (21, 40, 50) situated near said 

handling edge (6) and having a high coefficient of friction 
very much greater than that of the first part (27, 28, 29) of 

the baseplate (26). 
Magazine (20, 30) according to claim 1 characterised 
in that the retention area (21) is in the form of a strip 

of material with a high coefficient of friction disposed 
along the handling edge (6) and occupying part of the 

baseplate (26). 
Magazine (30) according to claim 2 characterised in 
that the first part (27) of the baseplate (26) partially 

covers the retention area (21). 
Magazine (40) according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the retention area (41) is constituted by the upper side 

of a motorised belt (45) made from a material having a high 
coefficient of friction, a top face of said belt being 

entrained towards the handling edge (6). 
Magazine (40) according to claim 4 characterised in 
that the first part (28) of the baseplate (26) partially 

covers the entrained belt (41). 
Magazine (50) according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the retention area (51) comprises a set of strips 

(52, 55) made from a material having a high coefficient of  
 

friction and disposed substantially perpendicularly to the 
handling edge (6). 
Magazine according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the material of the retention 

area is polyethylene. 
Device for unstacking flat objects (10) comprising 
routing means (14, 17), a feed magazine (20) according to any 

one of the preceding claims including a baseplate (26) 
delimited by a drop edge (24) and a handling edge (6), and 

handler means (7) for retaining a letter and entraining it in 
a predetermined transfer direction (Dt) towards transfer means 

(16), characterised in that the baseplate (26) comprises a 
retention area (21) near the handling edge (6) and adapted to 

slow down any movement in the transfer direction (Dt) of a 
letter (8) in said retention area.
