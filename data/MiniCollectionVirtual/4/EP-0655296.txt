<ABSTRACT>
The milling head (1) includes:     - a main body (2), - an interposed component (5) mounted so that it can rotate in the main body (2) and which is equipped with a first annulus gear (12a), - means for driving and immobilising the rotation of the interposed component (5) with respect to the body (2), - a spindle holder (3) which is mounted so that it can rotate about an axis XX' with respect to the interposed component (5), and to which is fastened a second annulus gear (12b) capable of meshing with the first annulus gear (12a) and which can move in translation along the axis XX' between a rotation-preventing position in which the annulus gears (12a, 12b) mesh in one another, and a position for rotating in which the two annulus gears (12a, 12b) are not in engagement, - means (13) for translation of the spindle holder (3) between the immobilised and the rotation positions, - and means (17, 18, 19) for driving the spindle holder (3) in rotation about the axis XX'.   The axis of rotation of the interposed component (5) with respect to the main body (2) is coincident with the axis of rotation XX' of the spindle holder (3), and the means for driving and preventing rotation of this interposed component (5) allow continuous rotational adjustment thereof through any angle about the axis XX'.

Tool-holder device, particularly milling head, which comprises:

a principal body (2) which allows assembly of the device on a machine-tool,
an interposed piece (5), which is mounted to rotate on the principal body
(2) and which is equipped with a first crown gear (12a),
means for driving and for blocking in rotation the interposed piece (5) with
respect to the principal body (2),
a spindle-holder (3), which is mounted to rotate along an axis (XX') with
respect to the interposed piece (5), on which is fixed a second crown (12b)

adapted to mesh with the first crown (12a), and which is mobile in
translation along the axis of rotation (XX') between a position of blockage in

rotation in which the crown gears (12a, 12b) mesh in one another, and a
position of setting in rotation in which the two crown gears (12a, 12b) are

out of mesh,
means for setting in translation (13) the spindle-holder (3) between the
positions of blockage and of setting in rotation,
and means for driving in rotation (17, 18, 19) the spindle-holder (3) along
the axis of rotation (XX'),

characterised in that the axis of rotation of the interposed piece (5) with
respect to the principal body (2) merges with the axis of rotation (XX') of the

spindle-holder (3), and in that the means for driving and blocking this

interposed piece (5) in rotation allow its continuous adjustment in rotation by
any angle along the axis of rotation (XX').
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the means for driving
and blocking the interposed piece (5) in rotation with respect to the principal

body (2) are designed to allow adjustment of the rotation of this piece, along
the axis of rotation (XX'), by any angle but within a limited range of values

(-α, +α).
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that the interposed piece
(5) is a dissymetrical piece with respect to the axis of rotation (XX'), of

which the edge (5c) most remote from the axis of rotation (XX') is a toothed
edge having the form of an arc of circle centred on the axis of rotation (XX'),

and in that the means for driving the interposed piece in rotation comprise at
least one pinion (8) which meshes with the toothed edge (5c) of the

interposed piece (5) and which is controlled in rotation. 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the means for blocking
the interposed piece in rotation are constituted by a hydraulic jack (10)

adapted to compress the interposed piece (5) against the principal body (2)
of the tool-holder device, in the vicinity of the toothed edge (5c) of the

interposed piece (5).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
principal body (2) of the tool-holder device is hollow, in that the interposed

piece (5) and the wall (2a) of the principal body (2) of the tool-holder device
on which the interposed piece (5) is mounted to rotate are traversed by the

spindle-holder (3), and in that the means for driving the spindle-holder in
rotation and/or translation (13) are placed inside the principal body (2) of the

tool-holder device.
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that, in its position of
blockage in rotation, the spindle-holder (3) is uncoupled from its means for

driving in rotation (17, 18, 19) along the axis of rotation (XX'), and in that, in
its position of setting in rotation, the spindle-holder (3) is coupled to its

means for driving in rotation (17, 18, 19).
