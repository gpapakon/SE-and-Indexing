<ABSTRACT>
In the production of particle film by contacting a 
solid or liquid substrate with a particle dispersive suspension, 

and sweeping, spreading and moving the leading edge of 
a meniscus formed at the 3-phase contact line by atmospheric 

air or gas, substrate and suspension, thereby forming the 
particles assembled, the particle density and the number of 

particle film layers are controlled by traveling velocity 
(Vc) of the leading edge of the meniscus, volume ratio of 

particles and liquid evaporation rate (je) using these are 
parameters. 
A method to produce stable wetting film of a large 
area, control of the number of particle layers and a method 

to supply particles are established and it is possible to 
produce a large quantity of dense particle film continuously.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a
particle film. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a method for continuously producing a
particle film and crystallized particle film comprising
particles arranged in order in terms of crystallization
which are useful in the areas of highly functional catalysts,
sensors and transducers, various optical materials
such as interference film, reflective film, reflection
preventive film, 2-dimensional particle multi-lens, light
adjusting film, color developing film, various electronic
materials such as conductive film, electromagnetic shielding
film, LSI board, semiconductor laser solid element and
optical and magnetic recording medium, photographic
materials such as highly sensitive photographic paper,
selective transmission film, molecular sieve and selective
adsorption film.Thin film technologies for producing a single- or a
multi-layered particle film as one form of assembly at a
high accuracy and efficiency wherein particles exert their
intrinsic useful functions to the greatest extent possible
have been conventionally used in the areas of highly
functional catalysts, sensors and transducers, various
optical materials such as interference film, reflective
film, reflection preventive film, 2-dimensional particle 
multi-lens, light adjusting film, color developing film,
various electronic materials such as conductive film,
electromagnetic shielding film, LSI board, semiconductor
laser solid element and optical and magnetic recording
medium, photographic materials such as highly sensitive
photographic paper, selective transmission film, molecular
sieve and selective adsorption film. Further, new thin film
technologies capable of giving new physical properties and
functions not found in individual particles per se to two-dimensionally
assembled particles are actively introduced in
the above said industrial areas.A number of particle film production methods are
currently studied, and a suitable one is selected according
to the production environment. They include the solution
system such as electrolytic precipitation, interface system
such as LB film, vacuum system such as deposition and CVD,
and dispersion system such as coating and spin coat.Of these methods, the dispersion methods such as
producing particle film from a particle dispersion system
such as emulsion and suspension by drying and solidification
include the above-mentioned spin coat, coating, and dipping
techniques. These are generally used as a practical method.Actually,
