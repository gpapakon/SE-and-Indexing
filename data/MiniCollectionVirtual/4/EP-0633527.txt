<ABSTRACT>
To reconstruct a spatial distribution of absorption 
coefficient of an object by an optical computer tomograph, a 

predicted value F(µ
k
) of a transilluminated light predicted 
for the k-th presumed image µ
k
 is computed using a predetermined 
prediction operator F, wherein k is an integer. On the 

basis of a detection value 
X
 at a light detection optical 
fiber and the predicted value F(µ
k
), a difference {
X
 - F(µ
k
)} 
is computed wherein when the difference {
X
 - F(µ
k
)} falls 
within a predetermined range, the k-th presumed image µ
k
 is 
determined as a real absorption in the object. For the 

initial computation, a first presumed image is determined 
based on the real measurement value. The determination is 

made under an assumption that the object is homogeneous in 
terms of optical absorption coefficient and optical scattering 

coefficient. The degrees of the optical absorption and 
scattering coefficients are determined based on characterizations 

of a time-dependent photo density curve obtained as the 
real measurement value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an optical 
computer tomograph for measuring spatial distributions of 
optical absorption/scattering coefficients in an object to be 
probed. In general, in diagnosing the function of a body 
organ, such as the cerebral tissues, the fundamental and 
important parameters to measure are the oxygen quantity in 
the body organ and the organ's utilization of oxygen. 
Supplying body organs with a sufficient quantity of oxygen is 
indispensable for the growth ability of new-born infants. If 
the supply of oxygen is insufficient, the probability that 
the new-born infant will die is high. Even if the newborn 
infant lives, serious problems in the body organs may 
remain as a sequel. The insufficiency of oxygen affects 
every body organ, but especially causes a serious damage in 
the cerebral tissues. To quickly and readily measure a quantity of oxygen 
supplied to body organs, such as brain, a diagnostic apparatus 
using near infra-red spectroscopy technique has been 
developed as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 
4,281,645 issued August 4, 1981. This apparatus allows safe 
continuous monitoring of changes in blood and tissue oxygenation 
on an intact organ. This is made possible by observing 
spectral changes in the tissues caused by oxygenated haemoglobin, 
deoxygenated haemoglobin and cytochrome. The absorption spectra of near infrared light (700 to 
1300 nm), αHb₂ and αHb by oxyhaemoglobin (HbO₂) and deoxyhaemoglobin 
(Hb), respectively, are different from each other.  
 
The absorption spectra of αCyO₂ and αCy by oxidized cytochrome 
a, a₃ (Cy), respectively, are different from each 
other. This diagnostic apparatus utilizes the above-described 
absorption spectra of near infrared light. Four near 
infrared light rays with different wavelengths, λ1, λ2, λ3 
and λ4 (e.g. 775nm, 800nm, 825nm, and 850nm) are applied to 
one side of the patient's head with a time-sharing method and 
the transmission light rays from the opposite side of the 
head are in turn detected. By processing these four detected 
light rays with the prescribed calculation program, the 
density change of oxyhaemoglobin (HbO₂), deoxyhaemoglobin 
(Hb), oxidized cytochrome a, a₃ (CyO₂) and reduced cytochrome 
a, a₃ (Cy) are calculated. These parameters, in turn, 
determine the change of cerebral oxygen quantity. Another devices using near infra-red spectroscopy 
technique have been proposed as disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publication No. 63-275323 or an article entitled
