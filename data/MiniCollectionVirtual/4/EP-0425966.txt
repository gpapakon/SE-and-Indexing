<ABSTRACT>
A method for controlling the wire loop height (50) of 
wires (30,40) above a reference plane installed during the 

manufacture of an electronic module with a wire bond machine 
provides for making adjustments based on the wire loop 

height adjustment resolution of the wire bond machine 
itself, rather than on an electrical performance 

specification tolerance for the module.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the manufacture of 
electronic modules and more particularly to methods for 
controlling the loop height for wires used to interconnect 
specific circuit elements contained in such modules. During the manufacture of certain electronic modules an 
apparatus called a wire bonder is used to provide an 
electrical connection between circuit elements using a 
plurality of wires, e.g. as disclosed in JP-A- 1-246 841. 
In certain RF modules the plurality of 
wires is used to provide a specific amount of inductance, 
and the height of such wires above a given reference plane 
within the module must therefore be controlled to a 
relatively close tolerance. Ordinarily this tolerance is 
selected based on the variation in one or more electrical 
performance specifications which occurs as a result of the 
variation in the height of these wires above the reference 
plane. During manufacture the actual height of the connecting 
wires is ordinarily allowed to vary within this tolerance 
based on the electrical specification, and adjustments to 
the wire bond apparatus are made only when the wire height 
is outside tolerance based on the electrical specifications 
for the module. Depending on the sampling rate used and the particular 
wire bond apparatus being used, the wire loop height may in 
a given case not only vary significantly from a desired 
nominal wire loop height, but in fact exceed the tolerance 
based on electrical specifications for a certain number of 
individual modules prior to detection by measurement of a 
given sample.  
 It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved method for controlling the wire loop 
height of an electronic module. The foregoing and other objects are achieved in the 
present invention wherein there are provided methods for 
controlling wire loop height as defined in independent claims 1 and 3. Thus, the present invention provides a method for 
controlling the wire loop height of an electronic module 
wherein the amount by which a given wire loop height is 
allowed to vary from a desired nominal height is based not 
on a given electrical specification, but on the adjustment 
resolution of a given wire bond apparatus, since 
the average actual 
wire loop height differs from a desired nominal value by 
approximately the adjustment resolution of the wire bonder. In a preferred embodiment the steps of calculating the 
average actual wire loop height and comparing this average 
to the desired nominal value are
