<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new biomaterial,
called a composite membrane, formed from hyaluronic acid or
derivatives
thereof or alginic acid or derivatives thereof and possibly a
gelled polysaccharide,
processes for its production, and the use
of such composite membranes in surgery for the guided
regeneration of tissues in the treatment of superficial
and internal lesions.Hyaluronic acid is a natural heteropolysaccharide
composed of alternating residues of D-glucuronic acid
and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. It is a linear polymer with
a molecular weight of between 50,000 and 13,000,000
depending upon the source from which it is obtained, and
the preparation and determination methods employed. It
is present in nature in pericellular gels, in the
fundamental substance of connective tissues of
vertebrate organisms of which it is one of the main
components, in the synovial fluid of joints, in the
vitreous humor, in human umbilical cord tissues, and in
cocks' combs.There are known, specific fractions of hyaluronic
acid with definite molecular weights that do not present 
inflammatory activity and which can therefore be used to
facilitate wound healing, or to substitute for the
endobulbar fluids, or which can be used in therapy for
joint pathologies by intra-articular injections as
described in European Patent No. 0 138 572 granted to
Applicants on July 25, 1990.Also known are hyaluronic acid esters, wherein all
or some of the carboxy groups of the acid are
esterified, their use in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic
fields and in the area of biodegradable plastic
materials, as described in U.S. Patents 4,851,521,
4,965,353, and 5,147,861 granted to Applicants, and in
European Patent Application 0 251 905 A2, published on
January 7, 1988.Hyaluronic acid is known to play a fundamental role
in tissue repair processes, especially in the first
stages of granulation, by stabilizing the coagulation
matrix and controlling its degradation, favoring the
recruitment of inflammatory cells such as
polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes, of
mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts and the
endothelial cells, and orienting the subsequent
migration of epithelial cells.It is known that the application of solutions of
hyaluronic acid can accelerate healing in patients
affected by bedsores, wounds and burns.The role of hyaluronic acid in the various phases
that constitute tissue repair processes have been
described, by the construction of a theoretical model,
by Weigel P.H. et al.: "A model for the role of
hyaluronic acid and
