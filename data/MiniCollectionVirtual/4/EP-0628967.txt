<ABSTRACT>
The plugger of the invention is based on pneumatic 
drives which position the plug facing the spring (12) 

provided at the end of the tube (13) to be plugged. The 
pneumatic drive system comprises three cylinders, two of 

which belong with the mobile part (1) and the third belongs 
with the fixed part (2). One of the cylinders (7) of the 

mobile part (1) drives horizontally whereas the other 
cylinder (10) in the said mobile part (1) drives 

vertically, so that movement of the two cylinders moves and 
guides the relevant plug from a loading tube (3) to the 

nozzle (11) facing the spring (12) and tube (13) of the 
fuel rod. This assembly, saving the fuel rod which is 

fixed, can all be moved by means of the cylinder (16) 
drive, this being the fixed part of the system, so that 

actuation of this third cylinder (16) horizontally causes 
the whole assembly (1), including the plug, to be moved, 

compressing the spring (12) and inserting the plug in the 
tube (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system for plugging the
ends of fuel rods used in nuclear reactors, the plugger as
such being designed to duly guide each plug from the
storage phase to its application onto the appropriate end
of the tube forming part of the fuel rod, using pneumatic
cylinders and a general mobile support which together cause
the plug to move and be guided until assembly on the end
of the fuel rod or tube, for the plug to be welded to the
respective tube, and be fixed thereto.The invention basically comprises a plug loading tube
in which the latter is placed manually, and takes up a
position due to gravity opposite a pneumatic cylinder which
on being activated positions the plug opposite a second
vertical pneumatic cylinder which by driving the same
positions the plug facing the position of final plugging.In this latter position when a third horizontal
pneumatic cylinder, which displaces the whole assembly,
including the plug, is activated, it compresses the
relevant spring with which it is usually fitted on the top
end of the fuel rods and inserts the plug into the tube.Fuel rods used in nuclear reactors comprise tubes the
inside of which carry uranium dioxide tablets which are
compressed by a spring provided at the top end of the so-called
fuel tube or rod, in order then to proceed with the
appropriate plugging, viz. applying a plug which compresses
such spring and closes the tube, thereby to determine the 
fuel rod as such, the plug being held on the end of the
tube by welding.A nuclear fuel rod plugger as disclosed in the preamble of claim 1 is known from EP-A-0 201 753.It is vital for the plugs to be impervious and
mechanically resistant in order to be able to hold the
fissile materials. It is also vital for the interface
between the plug and the end of the tube to have no defects
such as discontinuity, cracks or distortion of the tube,
which could lead to leakage. This same standard must be
applied to the tube-plug weld.Plugging the tube is a critical operation due to the
high pressure that must be exerted, inasmuch as the
positive stress of the spring and the interference there
might be between the plug and the tube must be overcome.
The said pressure force is usually of around 500 kg, viz.
the power to overcome the spring compression and the
pressing down of the plug.It is therefore convenient to use guides to line the
plugs with the tube for otherwise possible misalignments
or severance would cause strange particles to be deposited
in the fuel rod which would affect the mechanical

<CLAIMS>
Nuclear fuel rod plugger, being provided to duly
guide the plugs (4) which must close the ends of the tubes (13)

making up fuel rods used in nuclear reactors, to house the
said plug (4) on the end of the tube (13) in which it is applied,

overcoming the force of a relevant spring (12) and precisely
provided at the inner end part of the fuel rod tube as

such, and comprising a mobile frame (1) which may travel
horizontally on parallel guides (17) mounted upon a

corresponding general support (18), by the action of a
pneumatic cylinder (16) with its corresponding drive element (15),

characterised in that in the travelling frame (1) the
plugs (4) are individually guided from a loader (3)

through a pair of guides (5) and (8) by means of two
pneumatic cylinders (7, 10) arranged in said frame (1) until said plugs (4)

are arranged in the nozzle (11) through which the fuel
tube (13) will be inserted, the plug (4) standing still at all

times in such position (D3) with respect to the frame (1),
which will move forward to have the end of the tube (13)

and spring (12) inserted through the guide (11) until they
are coupled to the plug (4). 
Nuclear fuel rod plugger, as in the above claims,
characterised in that the loader (3) for plugs comprises

an inclined tube leading into the respective horizontal
guide (5) associated with the horizontal drive cylinder

(7), singularly characterised in that the drive (6)
associated with such cylinder (7) moves the respective

lower plug in the loader (3) through the guide (5) until
the vertical guide (8) associated with the vertical drive

cylinder (10) is reached, the drive (9) in the latter
moving the respective plug until the nozzle (11) is

reached, facing the spring and the end of the tube (13).
Nuclear fuel rod plugger, as in the above claims, 
characterised in that the cylindrical body (14) in which

the drive (15) of the pneumatic cylinder (16) corresponding
to the fixed part (2) of the assembly moves, constitutes

a rear extension of the actual mobile part or frame (1).
