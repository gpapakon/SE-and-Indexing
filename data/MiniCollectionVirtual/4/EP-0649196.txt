<ABSTRACT>
In order to create a low voltage installation system, consisting of two insulation-free electrical conductors which are stiff in terms of bending and can be laid parallel to one another, mounting and holding devices for arranging the conductors in a fixed position, a low-voltage power source which can be connected to the conductors, and electrical loads which can be mounted on the conductors, with whose aid a large number of lighting elements can be arranged, for example on a room ceiling relatively easily, it is proposed that the mutually parallel conductors (1) be arranged at a distance from one another in terms of the respective mounting plane so that one conductor (1) runs relatively close to the mounting plane and another conductor runs parallel thereto away from the mounting plate, such that a network of conductor pairs is formed from a large number of such conductor pairs, the mechanical retention and electrical connection of the conductors (1) of in each case one plane and mechanical, electrically insulated connection of the conductors (1) of the two planes to one another being provided at the intersection regions (5), and such that the intersection points (5) optionally additionally comprise holding devices (2, 3) for fixed-position mounting and/or an electrical supply device (6) and/or holding devices for electrical loads (4).

two bending-resistant, electrical, insulation-free 

conductors (1) which can be laid in parallel with one 
another, attachment and mounting devices (2, 3) for the

are electrically connectable to the latter, characterized 
in that the mutually parallel, rod-shaped conductors (1) 

are arranged at a distance above one another relative to 
the respective assembly plane so that one conductor (1) 

extends more closely to the assembly plane and one

plane, a network of conductor pairs is formed from a 
multiplicity of such conductor pairs, the mechanical 

mounting and electrical connection of the conductors (1) 
of one plane in each case and a mechanical, electrically 

insulated connection of the conductors (1) of the two 
planes to one another being provided at the nodal points 

(5), and the nodal points (5) optionally comprise, in 
addition, mounting devices (2, 3) for the fixed attachment 

of the installation system to the mounting plane 
and/or a current feeding device (6) and/or mounting

the conductors (1) are detachably attached at the nodal 

points (5).  
 
System according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the nodal points (5) are formed by supports which 

are composed of insulating material and which comprise a 
first support part (7) which engages under the ends of 

the lower conductors (1) situated in the nodal region in 
the installation position, a second support part (8) 

which engages over said ends and which, in addition, 
engages under the ends of the upper conductors (1) 

situated in the nodal region (5), and a third support

support part (8) comprises a second disc (13) which can 

be pushed onto the tube (25) and the third support part 
(9) comprises a third disc (14) which can be screwed onto 

the tube end, it being possible to clamp the conductor 
ends of the two conductor planes between the discs. 
System according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized

integrally with the latter so that two such structural 
components can be inserted into one another in opposite 

directions and complement one another to form a complete
