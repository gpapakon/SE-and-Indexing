<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an ATM switching 
network and in particular it is directed to such an ATM switching 
network that operates in the dual plane operation for better reliability 
and maintainability. More specifically, the present invention is 
concerned with an ATM plane merging filter which manages the 
merging of ATM cells emerging from the two identical planes. As telephone switching systems are required to work non-stop, 
24 hours a day, they must be made of the most reliable components 
arranged in the most efficient manner possible. But the use of highly 
reliable components alone is not enough to guarantee that breakdowns 
will not occur. Various ways of achieving the high reliability and 
maintainability of telecommunication switching systems have been in 
existence. These are the dual synchronous matched scheme, dual load 
sharing scheme, triplicated system, multi-computer hierarchy system, 
multi-computer democracy system, and multi-processor system, to 
name a few. Among these schemes, the dual synchronous matched 
scheme (dual plane operation) has been proven very successful. While this scheme is fairly routine in TDM switching, it has 
not been adapted for message switching or computing except in 
specialized cases. The reason for this is primarily the difficulty of 
macroscopic (message) synchronisation between the duplicated systems. 
The load-sharing/standby approach in these systems is also justified on 
the basis of end-to-end recovery protocols. The ATM switching operation possesses attributes of both 
synchronous and asynchronous behaviour. The generally synchronous 
nature of ATM transport should blend into the dual plane operation  
 
scheme nicely. What must still be dealt with, however, is the 
asynchronous behaviour introduced by queues in the switches and 
multiplexers. In TDM switches, disagreement between the planes can be 
dealt with channel by channel. The faulty channel generally does not 
affect other channels, their order or contents, or their connections 
because every channel is attached to a hardware timeslot. This is not the 
case for ATM switches. Since cells are not attached to timeslots but 
freely compete through arbitration mechanisms for available timeslots, 
any address change or other interference with the arbitration 
mechanism, for example as a result of a bit error, can change the order of 
cells. Consequently, a receiving peripheral cannot expect to receive 
matching pairs of cells from the two planes in the case of such errors.

<CLAIMS>
An ATM switching network for switching ATM cells whose switch 
header contains at least source, destination and sequence fields, the 

network including two switch matrices for dual plane operation, an ATM 
plane merging filter for generating a series of ATM cells to be delivered to 

an appropriate peripheral terminal comprising a cell FIFO (34) for storing 
ATM cells emerging from two switch matrices, and a peripheral link 

attached to the cell FIFO for delivering the series of ATM cells stored 
therein, characterised in that the plane merging filter further includes: 


multiplexing means (20) for multiplexing in interleaving fashion the 
ATM cells emerging from the two switch matrices onto a cell bus (22), 
header reading means for reading the source and sequence fields 
from the switch header of each ATM cell being carried on the cell bus and 

sending the same to filter control means (30); 
that the filter control means (30) includes content 
addressable memory means (32) for comparing the source and sequence 

fields of the each switch header with those of switch headers already stored 
in the content addressable memory means for identical source and 

sequence fields, 
that the content addressable memory means (32) is adapted to store the source 
and sequence fields of the switch header and to simultaneously send an 

enabling signal to the cell FIFO, only when the content addressable 
memory means does not already have an identical source and sequence 

fields; 
and that the cell FIFO is adapted only to store each ATM cell when enabled by 
the enabling signal. 
An ATM plane merging filter according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the content addressable memory means has addressing means for a 

cyclic operation. 
A method of filtering ATM cells in an ATM switching network for 
switching ATM cells whose switch header contains at least source, 

destination, sequence fields or the like, having two switch matrices for 
the dual plane operation, an ATM plane merging filter for generating a 

series of ATM cells to be delivered to an appropriate peripheral terminal  
 

comprising steps of storing in a cell FIFO (34) ATM cells emerging from two 
switch matrices and delivering through a peripheral link attached to the cell 

FIFO, the method being characterised by the steps of: 

multiplexing in the interleaving fashion the ATM cells emerging from 
the two switch matrices onto a cell bus (22); 
reading the source and sequence fields from the switch header of 
each ATM cell being carried on the cell bus; 
comparing the source and sequence fields of each switch header 
with those of switch headers already stored in content addressable memory 

means (32) for identical source and sequence fields, 
storing the source and sequence fields of the switch header in the 
content addressable memory means (32) and simultaneously sending an 

enabling signal to the cell FIFO (34), only when the content addressable 
memory means does not already have identical source and sequence 

fields; and 
storing each ATM cell in the cell FIFO only when enabled by the 
enabling signal. 
A method of filtering ATM cells according to claim 3, 
characterised by 


operating the content addressable memory means in a cyclic 
fashion, and 
locking out a faulty plane for a designated fixed period until error free 
operation is re-established.
