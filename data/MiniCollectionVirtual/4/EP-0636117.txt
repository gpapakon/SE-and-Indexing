<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the use of pyruvate
precursors for preparing a dietary supplement for mammals.Obesity is a multifactorial disease which affects upwards of 25% of the
adult population in the United States of America. It is estimated that in the
U.S.A. between 34-50 million adults are obese, with at least 5 million of those
adults receiving medical treatment for their obesity. The etiology of obesity
can range from simple overeating to severe hormonal imbalance. However, the
great majority of obesity is probably due to a complex relationship between the
many factors that regulate energy intake and utilization.Teleologically, obese individuals may be better prepared for survival in
time of limited food supply because of their ability to utilize energy in a more
efficient manner. However, given that there is almost an unlimited food supply
in the U.S.A., this efficiency of energy utilization probably leads to obesity.
Furthermore, obesity is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease, an increased risk of Type II diabetes, an increased risk of coronary
artery disease, and other chronic diseases. For example, it is believed that in
the U.S.A. there are over 6 million diagnosed cases of obese Type II diabetes,
with an estimated 4 million cases being undiagnosed.Given the large obese population and the associated problems, the area
of obesity research and product development for the management of obesity has
been explored, yet the problem remains. U.S. Patent No. 4,351,835 teaches a
method for preventing body fat deposition in mammals by oral administration of 
a mixture of pyruvate and dihydroxyacetone (DHA).Subsequent additional research with rats investigated the effect of
pyruvate and DHA under normal dietary conditions. In that study, rats were fed
either a controlled diet or an experimental diet in which part of the
carbohydrates were replaced with a 1:1 mixture of pyruvate and DHA, which mixture
constituted 15% of the total caloric intake. Rats which received the
experimental diet gained less weight, and had greater rates of heat production
and energy expenditure than rats receiving a control diet. The experimental diet
reduced body fat content by 32% without any significant effect on either protein
or water content.Similarly, in another study, Type II diabetic humans were fed 56 grams
of pyruvate and DHA in a 1:1 mixture for seven days, during which time period
glucose tolerance and turnover were measured. Reductions in fasting blood
glucose concentration and

<CLAIMS>
Use of at least one pyruvate precursor selected
from the group consisting of pyruvamide, pyruvyl-glycine,

pyruvyl-alanine, pyruvyl-leucine, pyruvyl-valine, pyruvyl-isoleucine,
and pyruvyl-phenylalanine for preparing a

dietary supplement.
Use of at least one pyruvate precursor according to claim 1
for preparing a

dietary supplement for reducing insulin resistance in
mammals, as measured with a glucose tolerance test.
Use of a pyruvate precursor according to claim 1
for preparing a dietary supplement for

reducing fat deposition in mammals to induce a loss of
weight.
Use according to any one of Claims 2-3 wherein the
pyruvate-glycine is synthesized via a benzyl ester

protection method.
Use according to any one of Claims 1-3 wherein the
pyruvate precursor constitutes between 0.5%-20% by weight of

the diet.
