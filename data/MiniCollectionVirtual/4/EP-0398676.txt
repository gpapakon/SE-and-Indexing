<ABSTRACT>
An over-the-needle catheter assembly is provided in 
which a restriction (50) of the inner diameter of the catheter 

tube (10) is formed in the proximity of the needle hub. The 
restriction is formed by heating a portion of the catheter 

tube to the softening point of the catheter material, 
stretching the catheter tube to cause the heated portion 

of the catheter tube to tighten about an inner needle or 
mandril, then releasing the stretching force to allow the 

stretched portion to relax, leaving a small gap between 
the inner wall of the catheter tube and the outer diameter 

of the insertion needle. The small gap is preferably 
sized to be on the order of the size of the diameter of 

blood cells to restrict the flow of liquids past the 
restriction and into the catheter hub.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention related to I.V. catheters and, in 
particular, to the prevention of blood backflow and blood 
pooling which could result in inadvertent contact with 
blood during the use of such catheters. US-A-4,762,516 (Luther et al.) and 
United States patent application serial number 335,472, 
filed April 10, 1989, (See EP-A-0 392 765) describe 
I.V. catheters with needle 
guards that are designed to protect medical personnel from 
inadvertent injury caused by needle sticks subsequent to 
use of the catheter needle. Such inadvertent needle 
sticks can result in infection by diseases borne by the 
blood of the patient from whose vascular system the needle 
has been previously withdrawn. The catheters described in 
this patent and patent application prevent inadvertent 
needle sticks by covering the needle tip with a needle 
guard extending from the needle hub as the needle is 
withdrawn from the patient's body. U.S. patent US-A-3388703 discloses an intravenous cannula 
assembly unit comprising a rigid hypodermic needle and a 
flexible cannula fitted over the needle and shrunk into 
intimate contact with the shank of the needle and in 
particular, with a reduced diameter portion of the needle 
located between the head and the shank of the needle. As a 
result, the combined needle-cannula diameter just rearwardly 
of the needle point is no greater than the normal diameter 
of the needle shank, thereby reducing the likelihood of 
trauma in inserting the unit.  
 It is not only desirable to protect medical personnel 
from the hazards of inadvertent needle sticks, but it is 
further desirable to provide protection from any contact 
with a patient's blood. Even in the use of one of the 
aforementioned catheters with needle guards, it is 
possible for medical personnel to come into contact with a 
patient's blood due to undesired leakage of blood from the 
catheter. During insertion of the needle into the 
vascular system of the patient, the clinician 
administering the catheter will try to locate the tip of 
the needle in a vein or artery of the patient. When the 
needle tip is properly located, there will be a small flow 
or flash of blood through the hollow needle and into the 
flash chamber at the proximal end of the needle. The  
 
clinician will note this presence of blood in the flash 
chamber as an indication of proper needle placement. The 
clinician can then advance the catheter into the vascular 
system and withdraw the needle from the patient, leaving 
the catheter cannula in place in the blood

<CLAIMS>
An over-the-needle catheter assembly comprising a 
catheter tube (10) having a distal tip and a proximal end 

attached to a catheter hub (12), said catheter tube (10) 
having a nominal diameter over a major portion of the length 

thereof for accommodating the passage of an insertion needle 
(20) through said catheter tube (10), said catheter tube 

(10) having a restriction (50), characterized in that said 
restriction is formed in the proximal portion of, and extends 

over a minor portion of, the length of said catheter tube 
(10) and restricts the backflow of liquid between the inner 

wall of a catheter tube (10) and a corresponding insertion 
needle (20) by providing a smaller radial gap between the 

inner wall of said catheter tube (10) and the outer diameter 
of the insertion needle (20) than exists between said inner 

wall of said catheter tube (10) and said outer diameter of 
said insertion needle (20) along said nominal diameter 

portion thereof. 
The over-the-needle catheter assembly of claim 1, 
wherein said restriction (50) is formed in the vicinity of 

the point of attachment of said catheter tube (10) and said 
catheter hub (12). 
The over-the-needle catheter assembly of claim 2, 
wherein the proximal transition of the diameter of said tube 

(10) from said restriction (50) to said nominal tube 
diameter is spaced apart from the distal end of said 

catheter hub (12) by approximately 3.175 mm (one-eighth of 
an inch). 
The over-the-needle catheter assembly of claim 1, 
wherein said minor portion of the length of said catheter 

tube (10) is approximately 6.35 mm (one-quarter of an inch) 
in length. 
The over-the-needle catheter assembly of Claim 1,  
 

wherein said smaller radial gap is in the range of 5.08 to 25.4 µm (0.2 to 
1.0 thousandths of an inch).

wherein said smaller radial gap is approximately 12.7 µm (0.5 

thousandths of an inch). 
The over-the-needle catheter assembly of Claim 1, 
wherein said restriction is thermally formed. 
A method of forming a narrowed inner diameter 
portion of a catheter tube (10) made of a polymeric material 

and exhibiting a nominal inner diameter which is greater 
than said narrowed diameter comprising the steps of: 


a. placing a cylindrical metallic member (20) within said 
catheter tube (10), which member (20) has a substantially uniform outer diameter 

which is substantially equal to that of an insertion needle; 
b. heating said portion of said catheter tube (10) to a 
temperature which is at least equal to the softening 

temperature of said polymeric material; 
c. applying a stretching force along said heated 
portion of said catheter tube (10) until the inner diameter of 

said catheter tube is reduced to a diameter which is less 
than said nominal inner diameter; 
d. holding said stretched tube in the stretched position for a predetermined 
period of time 
e. releasing said stretching force to allow said 
polymeric material to relax 
f. allowing said heated tube (10) to cool;

the step of:
 
   releasing said stretching force to allow said 

polymeric material to relax in the radial direction to 
leave a gap between the inner surface of said catheter 

tube (10) and the outer surface of said metallic member (20).

member (20) comprises an insertion needle.
