<ABSTRACT>
A rotary air motor has a liner disposed within a tool 
housing and having a cylindrical bore therethrough. A rotor 

having radially slidable vanes is eccentrically rotatably 
mounted in the bore by bearings in the plates of the liner, 

the vanes cooperating with the rotor and the liner to define 
a plurality of rotating variable volume fluid compartments. 

A fluid inlet port in one end plate communicates 
sequentially with the fluid compartments. First and second 

exhaust ports respectively formed in the end plates also 
communicate sequentially with the fluid compartments, but 

the two exhaust ports are angularly offset from each other 
so that the fluid compartments communicate first with the 

exhaust port remote from the entry end plate and then with 
the exhaust port at the entry end plate. The exhaust 

passage from the remote exhaust port passes along the 
outside of the liner back to the entry end plate, thereby 

ensuring cooling of both ends of the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluid powered motors
and, more specifically, to the cooling of or dissipation of
heat from such motors.A wide variety of fluid-powered tools, such as air
tools, utilize a rotary air motor which has a rotor mounted
eccentrically in a circular bore in a cylindrical liner
which may, in turn, be mounted in a tool housing. Movable
vanes mounted radially in the rotor extend outwardly to
contact the inner surface of the bore and provide sealing
for the driving fluid, typically compressed air. Inlet and
exhaust ports are provided in the housing to allow the
driving fluid to enter the bore, drive the rotor and exhaust
from the motor. The rotor is usually mounted in bearings in
a pair of end plates at opposite ends of the liner. As the
rotor rotates, the vanes cooperate with the liner to define
a plurality of rotating and variable volume fluid chambers
which sequentially communicate with the inlet and exhaust
ports. In such motors, the driving fluid typically also
serves to cool the motor.The fluid typically enters at the rear end of the tool
and motor. Heretofore, there have generally been two types
of exhaust arrangements, viz., front exhaust and rear
exhaust. In the front exhaust arrangement disclosed, e.g.,
in U.S. patent no. 3,885,355, the fluid exits the motor at
the front end thereof, i.e., the end which carries the
output shaft, while in the rear exhaust arrangement, the
fluid exits the motor at the rear end thereof, i.e., that
same end that the fluid enters; in this rear exhaust arrangement a part of the fluid flows through passages formed in the front end plate before it returns to the rear exhaust.In typical rear exhaust air tools disclosed, e.g., in
EP-A-0 141 175, the compressed air enters an air motor
chamber and, after a predetermined angular rotation, which
may be approximately 140Â°, the air exhausts from an exhaust
port in the rear end plate. As the air motor operates, the 
rotor rotates at a relatively high speed, which may be
approximately 20,000 rpm. The centrifugal force on the
vanes drives them into frictional engagement with the 
centrifugal force on the vanes drives them into frictional
engagement with the cylindrical liner, generating heat. The
rear exhaust motor provides good cooling of the rear end of
the motor, since the compressed air is relatively cool when
it enters and the expansion of the air upon exhausting back
to atmospheric pressure provides a further cooling effect.
However, this type of motor does not provide effective
cooling of the front
