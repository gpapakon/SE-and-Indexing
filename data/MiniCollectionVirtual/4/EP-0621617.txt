<ABSTRACT>
The circuit breaker (1) contains a housing body which is in the form of a box and can be installed in a switch cabinet. A switching lever (5) and an additional device (4), which can be passed to the outside through a door of the switch cabinet, are arranged on the front of the housing body. On the front, the housing body has a size which is defined by a flat bearing surface (6), from which the switching lever (5) projects. The additional device (4) has a flat rear, which corresponds with the bearing surface (6) and with an opening (3) in the switch cabinet door. Fastening means are furthermore provided with whose aid the additional device (4,19,22,25,27) or a further additional device (19,22,25,27), which can be exchanged with it, can be fixed on the bearing surface (6).

<CLAIMS>
Switch having a box-shaped housing body which 
can be installed in a switch cabinet and on whose front 

there are arranged a switching lever (5) and at least 
one additional device (4, 19, 22, 25, 27, 30), which 

lever and device can be passed outwards through a door 
(2) of the switch cabinet, characterized in that the 

housing body of the switch (1) has on the front a flat 
bearing surface (6) of defined size from which the 

switching lever (5) projects, in that the at least one 
additional device (4, 19, 22, 25, 27, 30) has a flat 

rear which corresponds with the bearing surface (6) and 
with an opening (3) in the switch cabinet door (2), and 

in that fastening means are provided for detachably 
fixing on the bearing surface (6) the at least one 

additional device (4, 19, 22, 25, 27, 30) or at least 
one further additional device (19, 22, 25, 27, 30), 

which can be replaced thereby. 
Switch according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the fastening means have at least one screw 

connection, having a threaded hole (7, 8, 9, 10) which 
is incorporated into the bearing surface (6), having an 

unthreaded hole (15, 16) which is provided in each of 
the additional devices(4, 19, 22, 25, 27, 30), and 

having a bolt (17, 18, 24, 26) which can be screwed via 
the unthreaded hole into the threaded hole (7, 8, 9, 

10). 
Switch according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the fastening means have at least one insertion 

opening (11, 12), which is passed from the edge of the 
bearing surface (6) into the housing body of the 

switch, and have at least one fastening tab (13, 14, 
20, 21) which projects outwards from the edge of the 

rear of each of the additional devices (4, 19, 22, 25, 
27, 30) and can be inserted into the insertion opening 

(11, 12), to form a hinge. 
Switch according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the bearing surface (6) is rectangular, especially  

 
square, and in that the threaded hole (7, 8) and the 

insertion opening (11, 12) are arranged on mutually 
opposite sides of each of the additional devices (4, 

19, 22, 25, 27, 30. 
Switch according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that one of the additional devices (4, 

27, 30) is a cover having an opening (29) for the 

switching lever (5) to pass through, which cover is 
used for protection of the bearing surface (6) as well 

as, possibly, recesses (37) which are provided in the 
bearing surface (6) for accommodating further 

additional devices. 
Switching apparatus according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that a further additional device, 

which is constructed as an ammeter and has a display 
device (31) which is fastened on the cover, is 

installed in the additional device (30), which is 
constructed as a cover. 
Switching apparatus according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that, in addition to the display 

device (31), the cover carries auxiliary circuits which 
are constructed as a driver circuit (36) and as a 

control logic circuit (35). 
Switch according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the auxiliary circuits of the ammeter can be 

connected by means of a plug connection to a data bus 
(34) and a power supply of a protection unit (6) which 

is provided in the switch (1). 
Switch according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that one of the additional devices 

(22) has a transmission which can be driven by an 
operating device (23) which is constructed in the form 

of a lever, can rotate and acts, while a rotary 
movement is being carried out, on the switching lever 

(5), which is supported such that it can pivot. 
Switch according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that one of the additional devices 

(25) has a transmission which can be driven by a motor 
and acts on the switching lever (5) of the switch (1).
