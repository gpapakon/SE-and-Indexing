<ABSTRACT>
A bin tray (1) is provided for supporting a mail bin (3) which receives documents (17) from a document processing machine. The bin tray (1) is slidable so that it may be stored underneath a table (11) when not in use and is lowerable and removable so as to facilitate access to the underside of the document processing machine. This is accomplished by use of a tray assembly (1, 2, 7, 9) which is removably and rotably attached to two support rods (5, 6) running underneath the table (11) in a direction perpendicular to the feeding direction of the documents (17) as they enter the bin (3). The support rods (5, 6) are generally vertically oriented with respect to each other and provide support for a housing (4) containing a slidable bin tray (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to document handling machines, and
particularly to document handling machines which include a
diverter table wherein the output of the machine is fed to at
least one receiving bin.Document handling machines which perform an operation, such
as sorting, labeling, or inserting, on a stream of documents are
well-known. Such machines often use a diverter table which
diverts each item to one of a row of bins. The bins rest freely
on trays extending outside the periphery of the table and the
bins are lifted and removed when they have accumulated a number
of documents. When one bin station is not in use, however, the
bin trays present an obstruction to persons inspecting and
repairing the table and components which are located on the
underside of the table.DE-C-40270 discloses a machine for processing flat
documents according to the preamble of claim 1.GB-A-2 104 878 discloses an automatic money depositing and disbursing
machine.US-A-4 423 995 discloses an arrangement for automatic changeover
between ream and skid loading in a continuous sheeter and US-A-4
984 780 discloses a stacker for stimulable phosphor sheets.It is an object of the present invention to solve the above
problems by a machine as defined in claim 1. The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages
of the invention will be apparent from the following more
particular description of the preferred embodiments as
illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which reference
characters refer to the same parts throughout the various views.
The drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being
placed upon illustrating the principles of the invention.Figure 1 is a perspective view showing basic elements of the
present invention.Figure 2 is a side view showing the tray assembly in an
upright, open position.Figure 3 is a side view showing the tray assembly in a
lowered, closed position.As shown in Fig. 1, support for a receiving bin 3 is
provided by a tray assembly 8 comprising a slidable bin tray 1
which slides on a slide means into housing 4. The slide means 
may comprise a set of tracks 7 in which a set of rails 25, Fig.
2, slides, or other known slide mechanism. Support for housing
4 is provided by upper and lower support rods 5, 6, which run
underneath the table in a direction perpendicular to the feeding
direction of the documents 17 as they are fed from the side of
the table 11 in FIG. 2. Housing 4 rests upon upper support rod
5 by means of notch 19, which is shaped so as to accept upper
support rod 5. As

<CLAIMS>
A machine for processing flat documents, of the type having
means (11) for accepting said flat documents (17) and a receiving bin (3) for

receiving documents (17) from said accepting means (11), comprising:

a slidable, lowerable, and removable tray assembly for supporting said
receiving bin, said tray assembly comprising:


a housing (4) comprising a rigid frame (2) and a slide means (7) attached

thereto;
a bin tray (1) for supporting said receiving bin (3), said bin tray (1) being
slidably attached to said housing (4) by said slide means (7), said slide means

being operable to allow said bin tray (1) to be recessed into said housing (4); and,
an upper support member (5) extending below said accepting means (11)
for supporting the housing (4) at a first location on said housing, characterized in

that
said accepting means (11) consist of a diverter table (11);
said slide means (7) are operable to allow said bin tray (1) to extend beyond
the periphery of said diverter table (11) when in an open position and be recessed

under said diverter table (11) when not in use; and said housing (4) is rotatably
and removably atached to said upper support member (5) so as to allow said

housing (4) to be removed or lowered away from said diverter table (11) to permit
access to an underside of said diverter table.
The machine for processing flat documents according to claim
1, wherein said upper support member (5) extends below said

document diverter table (11) in a direction perpendicular to a
feeding direction of said documents (17). 
The machine according to claim 1, further
characterized by a support leg (11) attached to the underside of

said housing (4) for supporting said housing at a second
location.
The machine according to claim 3, wherein said support
leg (11) extends between said second location on said housing (4)

and a lower support member (6), said lower support member
extending below said upper support member (5) in a direction

generally perpendicular to said upper support member.
The machine according to claim 1, wherein said housing
(4) is removably attached to said upper support member (5) by

means of at least one notch in said housing (4), said notch being
shaped so as to accept said upper support member (5).
The machine according to claim 5, wherein said housing
(4) is retained in position on said upper support member (5) by

at least one retaining tab (9) mounted to said housing.
The machine according to claim 3, wherein said support
leg (11) extends between said second location on said housing (4)

and a lower support member (6) extending below said upper support 
member (5) in a direction generally perpendicular to said upper

support member (5).
