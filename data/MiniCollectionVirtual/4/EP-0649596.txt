<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for controlling the broad-leaf weed
galium aparine in growing food crops, particularly cereal crops, by
application of herbicidal 1-aryl-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazol-5(1H)-ones to the
locus where control is desired.The selective activity of certain 1-aryl-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazol-5(1H)-ones
against the weeds of commercial crops has been described in the
patent literature. See, for example, U.S. Patent 5,125,958.DE3238590 describes certain triazolines which are unsubstituted in the
1 position and have to be substituted by alkyl, alkaryl or aryl groups in the 3
and 4 positions which are useful as selective herbicides for controlling
galium aparine. This patent teaches that the triazolines useful for this
purpose should not be substituted in position 1.USP4404019 discloses certain triazolines useful as selective
herbicides and states they are useful in controlling numerous weeds
including galium aparine. These triazolines have an alkyl subsistent in
position 4 and a phenyl substituent in position 1 which is unsubsituted or
alkoxy substituted at position 5 on the phenyl ring. The use of these
compounds to control galium asparine is not specifically described.Mededelingen van de faculteit landbouwwetenschapen, rijksuniversiteit
Gent 51 (2A) p409-420 describes fluroxypr a structurally unrelated
herbicide as being useful in the control of galium asparine.In accordance with the present invention, it has now been found that
these aforementioned triazolinones are highly effective in controlling the
destructive weed galium (Galium aparine), commonly known as "catchweed
bedstraw", in growing cereal crops such as wheat, barley, oats, rice and
rye. These triazolinones are effective in that (1) they control or suppress
galium rapidly for long periods of time, (2) they are selective for this weed
without harming the commercial cereal crop, (3) they may be used in low-level
amounts and degrade rapidly in the soil, and (4) they may be used by
either pre-emergent or post-emergent application in a variety of different
formulations.The triazolinones employed in the methods of this invention may be
defined as ones generally known in the prior art wherein the 5-position of 
the benzene ring carries a substituent (Q) as described in the following
structural formula :

wherein
R is halogen, or lower alkyl;R1 is haloalkyl;X is hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, or nitro; Y is hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, halo lower alkylsulfinyl,
