<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to use of
zona pellucida proteins, and more particularly to
methods for selectively effecting
transient infertility in mammals through use of
naturally occurring and recombinant zona pellucida proteins.The present invention relates to a method for inducing
reproducible transient infertility in a mammal by inducing in that
mammal antibodies directed to proteins found in the zona pellucida of that
mammal's oocytes. The zona pellucida (ZP) is a complex matrix surrounding the
mammalian oocyte, formed of glycoproteins secreted by ovarian cells. Zona
pellucida glycoproteins perform a variety of functions. For example, the
mouse ZP proteins previously designated ZP2 and ZP3 are complexed into
long filaments which are cross-linked by the protein designated ZP1 in the ZP
matrix providing structural integrity to the matrix. Wassarman, P.M., Annu.
Rev. Biochem.57:415-442 (1988). In addition to its structural role, mouse
ZP3 has been shown to be a sperm receptor in the ZP matrix. Bleil, J.P. and
Wassarman, P.M., Cell20: 873-882 (1980). Following binding of sperm to
ZP3 and the subsequent induction of the sperm acrosome reaction on the
surface of the ZP, ZP2 acts as a secondary sperm receptor that is necessary
for the maintenance of sperm binding to the egg. Bleil et al., Dev. Biol.128:
376-385 (1988). Because of its role in the maintenance of the oocyte and in
sperm-oocyte interactions, the ZP represents a logical target for design of
contraceptive agents which interfere with the fertilization process.Various groups have undertaken an immunological approach in
attempts to interfere with ZP functions and thus to decrease fertility in
immunized animals. See, Dunbar et al. In: International Congress on
Reproductive Immunology. T. Wegman and T. Gills (eds.). London: Oxford
Press, pp. 505-528 (1983); and Dunbar et al. In: Mechanisms and Control
of Animal Fertilization. J. Hartman (ed.) Academic Press, New York, pp.
139-166 (1983). These studies showed that active immunization of mammals
with ovarian homogenates decreased fertility. However, the large number of
components in such homogenates made the identification of antigens
responsible for the decrease in fertility nearly impossible. In addition, the use
of such a complex mixture creates a potential for unwanted and potentially
harmful side-effects.Research by various investigators using chromatographic
methods including SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and high
pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) have resulted in the
