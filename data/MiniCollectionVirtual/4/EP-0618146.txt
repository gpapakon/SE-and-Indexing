<ABSTRACT>
A container closure cap having a lid portion that is 
connectable to a base cap is disclosed. The lid portion 

includes a tongue portion that is connected to the 
remainder of the lid by a living hinge and a pair of 

fracturable tear lines. In order to access the container 
through the lid, the tongue must be raised, which causes 

the rupture of the tear lines and thus provides visual 
proof that the underlying container has been tampered 

with.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to tamper-evident 
dispensing closures and, more particularly, to a tamper-evident 
closure that is simple to manufacture and that 
does not require any specialized equipment to be fitted 
to a container. The importance of providing tamper-evident features on 
bottles and other containers is well known. Consumers 
have increasingly come to expect bottles and containers 
of all types that contain substances for ingestion to be 
equipped with a tamper evident feature. Although the use 
of such closures is widespread, the expense involved in 
producing such tamper evident containers has had a 
limiting effect on their use. If such closures could be 
manufactured more inexpensively than at present, they 
would be more widely used. One approach to providing a tamper evident closure is to 
use a shrink wrap about the container and closure. This 
approach does not require the closure itself to have a 
tamper evident feature. In order to access the contents 
of the container, the shrink wrap must be punctured or 
torn, which leaves a visible indication that the 
container has been accessed and perhaps tampered with. A related approach is to apply a band of tamper-evident 
tape about the circumference of the junction between the 
closure and the container. Unfortunately, each of these  
 
approaches requires that the shrink wrap or tape be 
provided by an additional piece of machinery through a 
secondary manufacturing operation after the container has 
been filled. The capital machinery necessary to perform 
these steps is often expensive, which has impeded the 
acceptance of this approach. In another approach, the closures themselves are made to 
be inherently tamper evident. Once manufactured, such 
closures need not require the additional assembly steps 
that the application of tape or shrink wrap require.For 
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,860,907 to Sondal describes a 
tamper-evident dispensing snap-on dispensing closure. The closure uses a living hinge to pivot the cap on the 
base. It also has tearable bridges on the cap which must 
be torn to lift the cap from the base, thus rendering the 
closure tamper-evident. It further has a tear-off part 
which must be removed off of some length of the 
circumference in order to lift the cap. U.S. Patent No. 
4,487,324 to Ostrowsky describes a tamper-evident 
dispensing closure that uses a living hinge to pivot the 
cap on the base. A tamper-evident strip must be 
partially removed to allow the cap of the closure to be 
lifted.

<CLAIMS>
A tamper evident closure for sealing an open-topped 
container having a neck, the closure comprising a lid, 

said lid including: 
an upper surface, said upper surface including a movable 

tongue portion that is attached to the lid by a living 
hinge and a plurality of regions that are fracturable, 

wherein the thickness of the fracturable regions is less 
than that of the adjacent portions of the lid; 

an annular skirt depending from the top of the lid; and 
means for attaching the lid to a container. 
The closure of claim 1, wherein the lid further 
comprises means for providing a secure connection between 

the lid and an underlying base cap or a container. 
The closure of claim 1, wherein the lid is made of 
a polymer. 
The closure of claim 1, wherein the tongue includes 
means for selectively sealing the tongue to an underlying 

base cap or container. 
The closure of claim 1, wherein the tongue includes 
a pull tab. 
The closure of claim 1, further comprising a base 
cap for attachment to a container and means for providing 

a secure connection between the lid and the base cap. 
The closure of claim 6, wherein the hinged tongue 
includes a sealing plug, and the base cap includes: 

a top surface that defines an orifice, said orifice being 
configured to mate with the sealing plug on the hinged 

tongue; and 
an annular skirt that is dependant from the top surface 

of the base cap. 
The closure of claim 6, wherein the base cap is 
equipped with a tamper evident feature that comprises a 

series of tabs equally space about the periphery of the 
annular skirt and a series of breakable connectors. 
The closure of claim 6, wherein the base cap is made 
of a polymer. 
The closure of claim 6, wherein the base cap 
includes an internal thread. 
The closure of claim 6, wherein the base cap and lid 
are formed via injection molding. 
A method for providing a tamper evident closure, the 
method comprising the steps of: 

attaching a base cap to a container, said base cap being 
equipped with a tamper evident feature; and 

securely affixing a lid to the base cap, said lid having 
an upper surface that includes a movable tongue portion 

that is attached to the lid by a living hinge and a 
plurality of regions that are fracturable, wherein the 

thickness of the fracturable regions is less than that of 
the adjacent portions of the lid so that the interior of 

the container cannot be accessed through the lid without 
rupturing the fracturable regions. 
The method of claim 12, wherein the tamper evident 
feature about the base cap comprises a series of tabs 

equally space about the periphery of the annular skirt 
and a series of breakable connectors. 
The method of claim 12, wherein the base cap is 
integral with the lid.
