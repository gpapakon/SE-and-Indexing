<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to controlled release dosage forms composed of a naproxen layer which contains a delayed release granulate of naproxen compressed with an immediate release granulate of naproxen and an immediate release naproxen sodium layer compressed with the naproxen layer, designed to promptly exert a therapeutic effect while also maintaining the therapeutic blood concentration for a prolonged duration of 24 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention herein is directed to new controlled 
release multi-layer pharmaceutical compositions 
containing a combination of naproxen and naproxen 
sodium. The first layer of the pharmaceutical 
composition consists of delayed release granulates of 
naproxen compressed together with immediate release 
granulates of naproxen. A layer of immediate release 
naproxen sodium is compressed onto the first layer of 
naproxen forming an adjacent layer or layers. Naproxen, [(S)-6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic 
acid, hereinafter also referred to as 
naproxen acid] is of the formula 
   Naproxen is widely used (in such an acid state) as 
an anti-inflammatory compound in the treatment of 
arthritis, and as an analgesic and antipyretic in the 
treatment of mild to moderate pain, such as 
dysmenorrhea or arthritis. Naproxen has a low water solubility and a 
comparatively slow rate of absorption which is a 
disadvantage when using naproxen as an analgesic. This  
 
drawback is overcome by the use of its salt, naproxen 
sodium. Naproxen sodium is the sodium salt of naproxen 
acid. Naproxen sodium, due to its higher water 
solubility, has a comparatively faster rate of 
absorption leading to a prompt analgesic and 
antipyretic effect. Hence, naproxen sodium is the drug 
of choice in the treatment of mild to moderate pain 
where a prompt therapeutic effect is desired. After 
absorption, both naproxen and naproxen sodium exist in 
the circulating blood as naproxen anions. Naproxen is available in 250 mg, 375 mg and 500 mg 
tablets and is generally administered in therapeutic 
doses of 500-1000 mg per day, while naproxen sodium is 
available in 275 mg and 550 mg tablets and is 
administered in therapeutic doses of 550-1100 mg per 
day. Both compounds have multiple frequencies of 
administration of 8-12 hours every day. Conventional dosage forms of naproxen or naproxen 
sodium are administered two to three times daily to 
maintain therapeutic blood levels which results in a 
large fluctuation in peak and trough blood levels. 
Controlled release dosage forms for naproxen have been 
designed to overcome this drawback by reducing the 
fluctuation and maintaining the desired therapeutic 
blood concentration as well as reducing the frequency 
of drug administration. Hsias and Kent (U.S. Patent Nos. 4,571,333 and 
4,803,079) disclose the use of controlled release  
 
naproxen formulations and disclose the use of 
controlled release naproxen sodium formulations. 
Therapeutic blood peak levels of naproxen are not 
achieved
