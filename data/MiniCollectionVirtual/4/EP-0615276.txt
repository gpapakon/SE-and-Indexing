<ABSTRACT>
A high pressure discharge lamp includes a pair of arc tubes connected 
electrically in parallel within an outer envelope, which includes a lamp stem having a 

pair of stem conductors entering the lamp envelope in a common plane. The arc tubes 
include conductive feed-throughs at each end thereof. A lamp frame supports the arc 

tubes in a plane parallel with the stem conductors and is welded directly to each of the 
feed-throughs with all welds in a common plane with the welds between the frame and 

the stem conductors. The frame includes a resiliently deformable transverse member 
which allows for independent changes in length of the arc tubes during lamp operation 

due to thermal expansion/contraction. The frame is free of slip fit connections with the 
feed-throughs and free of a
dditional conductive straps connected to the feed-throughs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a high pressure metal vapor discharge lamp 
having 
an outer envelope, a lamp stem sealing said outer envelope in a gas-tight manner and 
including a pair of stem conductors extending within said outer envelope in a common 
plane, a pair of arc tubes each having a ceramic wall enclosing a discharge 
space, a pair of metallic feed-throughs extending from opposing ends thereof, and a 
discharge sustaining fill in said discharge space, and a metallic lamp frame for supporting said arc tubes within said outer 
envelope and electrically connecting said arc tubes in parallel, said frame means being 
electrically connecting said arc tube feed-throughs. Such a lamp is known, for example, from US-A-4,868,449 and 
US-A-4,906,888 (Dunn et al) and US-A-4,287,454 (Feuersanger et al) which disclose a 
dual arc tube high-pressure sodium discharge lamp. In each of these lamps the lamp 
frame supports the arc tubes longitudinally within the envelope and aligned with each 
other in a plane transverse to the plane extending through the stem conductors. Because of the electrically parallel configuration, a discharge is 
maintained in only one of the arc tubes during lamp operation. If the one arc tube is 
extinguished during operation, for example due to an interruption in the power supply, 
the other arc tube will ignite first upon restoration of power to the lamp because of its 
lower temperature. The arc tube which was previously operating will remain off. Thus, 
during operation the arc tubes will have different lengths due to thermal expansion 
because one of the arc tubes will be at a higher temperature. Additionally, their lengths 
will change upon switching the lamp on and off. In these lamps, the frame includes a member which is welded directly to 
the metallic feed-throughs at one end of the arc tubes. At the other end of the arc tubes, 
the frame includes a stabilizing member which includes a portion inserted into each of  
 
the tubular feed-throughs with a slip fit. The slip fit allows for changes in length of the 
ceramic arc tubes independently of each other due to the above-mentioned thermal 
expansion. To ensure a good electrical connection with the feed-throughs which have 
the slip-fit with the stabilizing member, additional flexible conductors in the form of 
straps or wires are welded to the stabilizing member and these feed-throughs. The frames for the above lamps are rather complex and include numerous 
metallic frame parts which must be accurately positioned and welded
