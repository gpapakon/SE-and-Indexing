<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to improve the skin mildness of hypochlorite-based
compositions.It is highly desirable to incorporate
hypochlorite in detergent compositions for bleaching.
However, hypochlorite is an irritant and many consumers
suffer from skin irritation when using such compositions. Particularly, the hands of the user are prone to such
irritation. As a result of coming into contact with such
compositions the hands suffer from dryness and from a feeling
of tightness. This occurs when the compositions are used neat
and also when used in diluted form.It is believed that hypochlorite attacks the uppermost
layer of the epidermal of the skin. This results in the
decrease of the elasticity of the skin. The skin also becomes
more sensitive, resulting in dryness and coarseness of the
skin. In addition the skin may become inflamed and become red
and sore and itchy. These effects are magnified in alkaline
conditions, because alkali is also an irritant. Alkalinity is
required for hypochlorite stability and it thus the preferred
condition for hypochlorite-comprising compositions. However,
alkaline conditions contribute to skin tightening because it
alters the natural pH of the skin.The object of the present invention is to improve skin
mildness and reduce skin irritation of hypochlorite-comprising
compositions.The present invention overcomes these problems by the
use of the combination of amine oxides and specific alkyl
sulphates in hypochlorite-comprising compositions. It is
believed that this surfactant combination wets the skin and
provides a protective layer against hypochlorite and
alkalinity on the skin.Amine oxides and alkyl sulphates are known in the art.
US 4 282 109 discloses a thickened bleach composition
comprising hypochlorite and a thickening amount of a
surfactant blend, comprising amine oxide C10-C18 and alkyl
sulphate C8-C12. There is no mention of the reduction of
hypochlorite related skin irritation of these compositions.EP 274 885 discloses thickened bleaching compositions
comprising alkali metal hypochlorite and straight chain C14
amine oxide with a mixture of branched and straight chain
C15 amine oxide. There is no mention of short chain 
surfactants or the reduction of hypochlorite related skin
irritation.EP 233 666 discloses a process for the manufacture of a
thickened bleaching compositions comprising hypochlorite, a
hypochlorite-soluble surfactant, including amine oxide and
an alkali metal salt of a fatty acid. There is no mention of
the reduction of hypochlorite related
