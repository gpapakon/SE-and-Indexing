<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement is used for guiding the web and the supporting belt (15) from one drying cylinder (11) to a deflection roll (10). The deflection roll (10) has perforations (13) which can be connected to a low-pressure source. This is by means of an external suction box (14), the suction box (14) having longitudinal sealing strips (28, 29), which cooperate with the roll cover (10a), in the region of the free peripheral part of the deflection roll (10). The longitudinal sealing strips (28, 29) are designed in the manner of a doctor blade and are secured to the suction box (14) in a resiliently yielding manner; they lie at least approximately tangentially on the roll cover (10a), only gentle contact being produced.

Arrangement for guiding a fiber material web which is to be dried,
together with a porous support band (15), through a drying

apparatus, comprising the following features:

a) the arrangement serves for the guiding of the web and of the
support band (15) on a substantially straight travel path

from a heatable drying cylinder (11), around which the web
and the support band is wrapped over a part of its periphery,

with the heatable drying cylinder contacting the web, to a
deflection roller (10), around which the support band and the

web is wrapped over a part of its periphery, with the
deflection roller contacting the support band;
b) the roll jacket (10a) of the deflection roller (10) has cut-outs,
preferably perforations (13), which can be connected to a

suction source by means of an external suction box (14)
which is arranged at the portion of the periphery of the

deflection roller which is free from the support band (15) and
the web;
c) the suction box (14) has a first outer wall (17) which extends
along the named path of travel and has a deflection device

(16) in the region of the run-off location (A) from the cylinder
(11), the deflection device (16) extending transversely to the

web travel direction over the length of the suction box and
serving to deflect the air boundary layer which is carried 

along by the support band (15);
d) opposite to the free peripheral portion of the deflection roller
(10) the suction box (14) has at least one suction opening

with sealing strips which cooperate with the roll jacket (10a),
among which is at least one longitudinal sealing strip (28

and/or 29) which extends transversely to the web travel
direction through the "run-off wedge" (24).
e) 
characterized in that
 at least one longitudinal sealing strip
(28 and/or 29) is formed in the manner of a scraper blade

and is resiliently yieldingly secured at the suction box (14),
with it lying at least approximately tangentially in contact at

the roll jacket (10a).
Arrangement in accordance with claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a
respective longitudinal sealing strip (28, 29) is formed in the

manner of a scraper blade is provided in the "run-on wedge" (23)
as well as in the "run-off wedge" (24).
Arrangement in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2,

characterized in that
 each longitudinal sealing strip (28 and/or
29), which is formed in the manner of a scraper blade, is

resiliently yieldingly secured to the suction box (14) in such a
manner that it only gently contacts the roll jacket (10a), i.e. with a

pressive contact force which amounts at least approximately to
zero. 
Arrangement in accordance with claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3,

characterized in that
 at least one of the two longitudinal sealing
strips (28, 29) is secured to the suction box (14) by means of an

arcuate (when viewed in cross-section), resiliently yielding holder
(37a).
Arrangement in accordance with claim 1, claim 2 or claim 3,

characterized in that
 at least one of the two longitudinal sealing
strips (28, 29) is secured to the suction box by means of a holder

(37) which is flat (when viewed in cross-section).
Arrangement in accordance with claim 5, 
characterized in that

the flat holder (37) forms an at least approximately smooth
surface with the adjoining outer wall (17, 26).
Arrangement in accordance with claim 5 or claim 6,

characterized in that
 the flat holder (37) is resiliently yielding.
Arrangement in accordance with claim 6 or claim 7,

characterized in that
 the smooth surface is at least
approximately parallel to the substantially straight travel path of

the support band (15) or includes a small angle with the latter.
Arrangement in accordance with any one of the claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that
 the suction box, when viewed in cross-section,
is pivotal about an axis of rotation (P) which extends

transversely to the web travel direction and which lies in the
vicinity of the longitudinal sealing strip (29) which is located in 

the run-off wedge (24).
Arrangement in accordance with any one of the claims 1 to 9,

characterized in that
 the deflection device (16) is formed as a
scraper strip.
Arrangement in accordance with claim 10, 
characterized in that

the scraper strip (16) can be removed a certain distance from the
support band (15), which is guided by the drying cylinder (11).
Arrangement in accordance with claim 11, 
characterized in that

the scraper strip (16) is pivotally mounted.
Arrangement in accordance with any one of the claims 1 to 12,

characterized in that
 the paper web and the support band (15)
run from the deflection roller (10) to a second drying cylinder (12);

and in that the suction box (14) has at least one air blowing
opening (35) in the region of the run-on location (onto the second

drying cylinder) of which the blowing direction is at least
approximately tangential to the jacket of the second drying

cylinder (12).
Arrangement in accordance with claim 13, 
characterized in that

a blowing-air guide wall (36) is provided between the air blowing
opening (35) and the deflection device (16).
Arrangement in accordance with claim 1, claim 4, claim 5 or
claim 13, 
characterized in that
 the suction box (14) has as a

passage and in which a partition wall (33) for the
formation of two suction passages is arranged.
Arrangement in accordance with claim 15, 
characterized in that

the partition wall (33) is tubular.
