<ABSTRACT>
Triazine compounds useful as flame retardants have the formula (I) where Am represents an amino group, Pp represents a phosphonic group and Z represents an amino group or a phosphonic group, or are polymers comprising repeating units of formula (II), where (a) is a diamine residue. The triazine compounds are used as flame retardants in plastic materials, particularly polyurethane foam or artificial fibres, or in intumescent fire protection compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to substituted triazine
compounds and to their use. In particular, it relates to
sym-triazine (1,3,5-triazine) compounds containing a
phosphonate groups
which are generally useful as flame retardants, especially in polyurethane foams.US-A-3210350 describes sym-triazine compounds having
one or two of the three ring carbon atoms attached to a
phosphonic radical of the formula:-

   where R represents hydrogen or a saturated hydrocarbon group
of up to 12 carbon atoms and X represents -OR or -NR2; the
other ring carbon atom(s) are attached to a hydroxy,
mercapto, nitro, acyl, acyloxy, amino, alkoxy, aryloxy,
cycloalkyloxy, alkylsulpho, arylsulpho, cycloalkylsulpho,
ureido, hydrazino, alkyl, aryl or cycloalkyl group. The 
compounds are stated to be useful as fire retardants, rust
inhibitors, chemical intermediates, rust removers,
electroplating additives, herbicides, insecticides, ion
exchange resins, tanning agents, water-soluble interfacial
agents, water-insoluble dispersion agents, detergents,
wetting agents, gasoline inhibitors and monomers for vinyl
polymerisation and copolymers. US-A-3158450 describes the
use of such a compound or a metal derivative thereof as an
additive to leaded gasoline to inhibit engine misfiring.
US-A-3011998 describes condensation products of such
triazine compounds with an aldehyde.An article by J.P. Moreau and L.H. Chance in "American
Dyestuff Reporter", May 1970 at pages 37-38 and 64-65
describes the evaluation of 2-amino-4,6-bis(diethoxyphosphinyl)-1,3,5-triazine
and 2,4-diamino-6-diethoxyphosphinyl-1,3,5-triazine
as possible flame
retardant finishes for cotton. An article by the same
authors in the same journal in February 1971 at pages 34-38
describes the evaluation of the formaldehyde derivative of
2,4-diamino-6-diethoxyphosphinyl-1,3,5-triazine as a flame
retardant for cotton. US-A-3654274 describes new processes
for preparing this compound.An article by J A Mikroyannidis in J Polymer Science:
Part A; Polymer Chemistry, Vol. 26, pages 583-593 (1988)
describes linear poly(dialkoxyphosphinyl-sym-triazine)s
prepared by interfacial or solution polycondensation
reactions of various diamines such as ethylene diamine,
hexamethylene diamine or bis(4-aminocyclohexyl) methane with
2-dialkoxyphosphinyl-4,6-dichloro-sym-triazines.According to one aspect of the invention a polyurethane
foam contains a phosphorus-containing heterocyclic flame
retardant and is characterised in that the flame retardant
is a sym-triazine compound of the formula: 

where R1 and R2
