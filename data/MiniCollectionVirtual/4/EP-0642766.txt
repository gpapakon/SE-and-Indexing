<ABSTRACT>
A surgical apparatus (10) for manipulating body 

tissue which comprises a handle member (212), a generally 
elongated member (214) extending from the handle member, 

means positioned on said elongated member for holding a 
grasping instrument; a channel (224) positioned in the 

elongated member for transporting fluid to the distal end 
portion of said elongated member, and a seal (222) positioned 

on an outer surface of said elongated member. 
The apparatus of the present invention is particularly useful for 
manipulation of the uterus such as in hysterectomy procedures, but may 

also be effectively used in gastrectomy procedures, manipulation of the 
intestinal organs during bowel resection and manipulation of the gall 

bladder during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
manipulating body tissue during surgical operations and, 
more specifically, to an apparatus for manipulating a 
uterus for examination of the uterine cavity during 
surgical procedure and for allowing the introduction of 
dyes or marker substances.. Laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery has been 
widely accepted as the preferred surgical procedure for 
treatment of a variety of disorders that were formally 
treated by conventional surgical techniques. In 
laparoscopic procedures, surgery is performed in the 
interior of the abdomen through a small incision; in 
endoscopic procedures, surgery is performed in any hollow 
viscous of the body through narrow endoscopic tubes 
inserted through small entrance wounds in the skin. In conjunction with laparoscopic surgery, 
pneumoperitoneum gases are generally introduced into the 
peritoneal cavity to expand the cavity and raise the cavity 
wall away from the vital organs therein. Thereafter, a 
trocar, which is a sharp pointed instrument, is inserted 
into a cannula assembly and used to puncture the inner 
lining of the peritoneal cavity. The trocar is withdrawn 
and a laparoscopic surgical instrument is inserted through 
the cannula to perform the desired surgery.  Laparoscopic and laparoscopically assisted 
surgical techniques are currently being performed in 
operative procedures involving the uterus, such as, for 
example, examination of the uterus for the purpose of 
sterilization, or, for investigating tubal patency in cases 
of infertility or for laparoscopically assisted vaginal 
hysterectomy procedures. In such techniques, it is often 
necessary to manipulate or reposition the uterus in order 
to gain visual and tactile access to different areas of the 
uterus and the surrounding organs. It certain procedures 
such as determining the patency of fallopian tubes, it is 
also desirable to insert dyes or marker substances 
intravaginally. Prior art devices for manipulating or 
repositioning the uterus include uterine grasping forceps 
which enable the surgeon to firmly grasp the uterine cervix 
and manipulate it to a desired position. However, due to 
the narrow configuration of the forceps jaws, such 
manipulation can result in injury to the uterus including 
penetration of the uterine wall or tearing surrounding 
tissue. Another type of uterine manipulator device 
includes a catheter having an inflatable or hollow balloon 
member at a distal end thereof. The catheter is introduced 
within the cervix and
