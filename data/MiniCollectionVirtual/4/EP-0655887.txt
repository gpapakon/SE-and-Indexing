<ABSTRACT>
A device is disclosed for measuring a mass flow (KS) deflected at the outlet of an elevator (E) at a feeding shaft wall (G), in particular of a harvester, so that a stratified dielectric having a homogeneous speed is formed in a flow rate measurement capacitor (NC) arranged at that spot and whose capacitance, dependent on filling level, is continuously measured. The first capacitor plate (MC1) is located at the mass flow side and the second capacitor plate (MC2) is spaced apart from the mass flow (KS). The first capacitor plate (MC1) is bordered by a protective electrode (R1) held at the same potential as the bordered capacitor plate (MC1) by an impedance transformer. The second capacitor plate (MC2) is formed by a feeding shaft wall opposite to the first capacitor plate (MC1) and by lateral feeding shaft wall areas. At least one further partial electrode (R2) is provided besides the protective electrode (R1). In addition, the protective electrode (R1) extends at least partially on the feeding shaft sidewalls between both capacitor plates (MC1, MC2).
