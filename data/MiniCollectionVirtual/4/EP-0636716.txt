<ABSTRACT>
The process of the present invention comprises wet 
spinning or dry-jet-wet spinning a PVA-based polymer soluble 

in water at not more than 100°C while using a dope solvent 
and a solidifying solvent each comprising an organic 

solvent, wet drawing the solidified filaments, subjecting 
the drawn filaments to extraction treatment and then drying, 

and further subjecting the filaments to heat shrinking 
treatment under multi-stage temperature elevation condition. 

The water soluble fibers of the present invention obtained 
by this process, while having a low water dissolution 

temperature of not more than 100°C, have a markedly small 
maximum shrinkage in water and has high tensile strength and 

small ash content. The water soluble fibers of the present 
invention are suitably used for chemical lace base fabrics 

and blended yarns with wool or jute.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to water soluble fibers
comprising a polyvinyl alcohol (hereinafter referred to as
"PVA") and having excellent dimensional stability. More
specifically, the present invention relates to water soluble
PVA fibers which, while being readily soluble in hot water
at a temperature up to 100°C, shrink only to a small extent
under high humidities, as well as upon dissolution, and have
high tensile strength and small ash content. These fibers,
having the above features, have very good handleability and
give high-quality finished products and are hence suitably
used for chemical lace base fabrics and blend yarns with
wool, flax or ramie.Known water soluble fibers include PVA-based fibers,
cellulose-based fibers such as carboxymethylcellulose fibers,
polyalginic acid fibers,polylactic acid fibers and polyalkylene
oxide fibers, and are suitably used utilizing
their features. Among these water soluble fibers, PVA-based
fibers are used most widely because of their high tensile
strength.Various water soluble PVA fibers have been proposed by,
for example, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 8992/1968 and
10174/1978 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Nos. 
199408/1991, 28408/1987, 86503/1993, 45424/1978 and
229805/1989.Among the above literature, Japanese Patent Publication
No. 8992/1968 describes a process for producing a water
soluble fiber which comprises conducting dry spinning of a
high-concentration aqueous PVA solution. However, the fiber
obtained by this process has a large shrinkage upon
dissolution in water of 30% and hence chemical lace base
fabrics utilizing this fiber shrink, when being dissolved
off with water, to a large extent, thereby deforming the
lace pattern embroidered thereon. Consequently, such base
fabrics are not usable for preparing high-quality laces
having fine patterns.Japanese Patent Publication No. 10174/1978 describes a
process for producing a fiber being soluble in low temperature
water, which comprises using a carboxyl group-modified
PVA as raw material. However, the fiber obtained by this
process has the drawback of shrinking to a large extent by
absorbing moisture when allowed to stand under high
humidities. The fiber as well as finished products obtained
therefrom must therefore be stored under a specific
atmosphere with controlled, low-humidity.Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 199408/1992
describes a process for producing a water soluble fiber,
which comprises, in order to decrease the shrinkage upon
dissolution in water, using a PVA having
