<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of a high-Tc superconductor as precursor material for the oxide-powder-in-tube method, in which the oxides of the elements Bi, Sr, Ca and Cu are mixed and completely melted at temperatures of 
>
/= 1000@C, in which the melt is cast onto a substrate which is maintained at room temperature and in which the cooled melt block is comminuted and ground to a powder.

A process for preparing a high-temperature
superconductor precursor containing bismuth,

strontium, calcium and copper from a powder
mixture of metal oxides which may additionally

contain alkaline earth metal carbonates and
contains the metals in an atomic ratio

corresponding to a superconductor, where the
powder mixture is completely melted in air at

temperatures above 1000°C, the melt is then poured
out onto a base which is at room temperature, and

the cooled melt body is subsequently crushed,
wherein the powder mixture is, prior to melting,

heated to temperatures in the range of from 600 to
900°C in a flowing gas atmosphere so that a powder

whose C content is less than 5000 ppm is obtained,
and the material of the crushed melt body is

ground to powder having a mean grain size d
50
 ≤
5 µm and containing an amount of iron

contamination of significantly less than 200 ppm.

 are
employed, in which bismuth can be replaced, up to

an amount of 50 mol%, by lead and/or antimony, and 
in which strontium and calcium can be replaced, in

an amount of from 0 to 30 mol%, by yttrium.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein
the mixture, prior to melting, is filled into a

crucible, which preferably is composed of
platinum, and is then melted in a furnace at

temperatures above 1050°C.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
3, wherein the duration of melting is more than

15 min, preferably more than 30 min.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
4, wherein the melt is poured out onto a thermally

stable plate, especially composed of ceramic or
metal, preferably of copper, and wherein the

cooling rate of the melt is in the range of from 1
to 100 K/s, preferably from 5 to 30 K/s.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
5, wherein the solidified melt body is broken up

coarsely in a mortar or with a hammer and is then
subjected to further coarse crushing, and wherein

the material is then further reduced in size until
a grain size in the range of d
50
 ≤ 5 µm, preferably
d
50
 ≤ 3 µm, is attained.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to
6, wherein the coarsely broken solidified melt is

heated under a defined oxygen partial pressure at
temperatures between 600 and 900°C and is then

further reduced in size.
A precursor for a Bi-2223 high-temperature superconductor,
