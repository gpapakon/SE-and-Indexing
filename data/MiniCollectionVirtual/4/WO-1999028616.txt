<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fuel injection valve for internal combustion engines, comprising a valve member (11) that can be displaced in the axial direction in a valve body (1). Said valve member cooperates with a valve seat surface (15) on the valve body (1) and with a tight surface (13) to control an injection orifice (17). The end of said member facing away from the combustion chamber is impinged upon by a valve spring (31) arranged in a spring chamber (29) in the closed position. The valve member (11) has a pressure shoulder (21) working in the opened direction,  which projects into a pressure chamber (19) that can be filled with high pressure fuel. The spring chamber (19) is connected to the pressure chamber (19) through a choke gap and is closed in relation to a fuel return system so that the spring chamber (29) acts as a hydraulic damper when the valve member (11) lifts to the opened position.
