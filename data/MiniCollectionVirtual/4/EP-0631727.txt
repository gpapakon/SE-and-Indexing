<ABSTRACT>
It is disclosed herein that; a defatted rice 
germ, which was obtained by defatting the rice germ with an 

organic solvent or through a super critical extraction 
method, is further water-extracted to obtain a crude 

product containing a lipase inhibitor, and thus-obtained 
crude product is further purified by conducting a dialysis, 

ultra filtration or the like to obtain a partially purified 
lipase-inhibitor preparation. 
The above rice term-resulting lipase inhibitor-containing 
crude product or its partially purified 

preparation is added to foods or pet feeds thereby allowing 
them to be remarkably excellent in anti-obesity effect as 

compared with prior art such as that derived from wheat 
germ or soybeans.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a crude lipase
inhibitor-containing product, its purified preparations,
anti-obesity foods and anti-obesity feeds for pets which
are useful for preventing or treating obesity which induces
so-called adult diseases such as cardiac disease,
arteriosclerosis, diabetes and the like.It is often becoming high obesity that people
make a meal containing high fats and oils. In this connection,
occurance rate of the above adult diseases are
gradually increasing in parallel with obesity in degree.
For treatment of such a trend, there should be a way to
disturb digestion and absorption of fats and oils, in
addition to improvement of diet to low fat and low oil
Japanese type foods.As an inhibitive substance of lipase, for example,
Patent Kokai 4-300839 reports that serum albumin, β-lactoglobulin
or a certain kind of soy-bean protein or
basic protein derived from wheat-germ will inhibit the
action of lipase, thereby suppressing or inhibiting
decomposition of emulsified lipids.However, among the above mentioned materials,
serum albumin, β-lactoglobulin or a certain soy-bean
protein does not exert such an action in the presence of
bile acids.On the contrary, there is reported that the 
basic protein derived from wheat germ suppresses or
inhibits action of lipid-decomposition enzyme even in an
emulsified system of lipids in the presence of sodium
taurocholic acid which is a bile acid.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a crude product containing a lipase inhibitor
derived from a defatted rice germ, and also a lipase-inhibitor
preparation obtained by partially purifying said
crude product. It is a further object of the present
invention to provide anti-obesity foods and feeds having
incorporated therein said crude lipase-inhibitor product or
said preparation.Referring to lipid-decomposition enzyme inhibitor
materials, which are derived from rice germ in the present
invention, a water-soluble protein (water-soluble extract)
resulting from rice germ can be obtained by defatting the
rice germ, which is followed by water-extraction. Said
materials may exert inhibiting or suppressing effect on
lipase in the presence of a bile acid and in a lipid-emulsified
system. The present inventor has found that in
such a function and effect the present lipase inhibitor
derived from rice germ is conspicuously remarkable, as
compared with already known analogous materials resulting
from wheat germ, soy bean, etc. Fig. 1 is the drawing showing in a semi-logarithmic
graph a comparison between
