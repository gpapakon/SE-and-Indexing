<ABSTRACT>
A terminal of a disaster prevention monitor of the 
present invention detects the power-on of a terminal and sets 

flag information. When a polling call from a central monitor 
(receiver) is directed to a terminal after a power-on 

operation, the terminal transmits an information fetch request 
signal which requests the receiver enter an initialization 

routine for initialization of the terminal information. The 
receiver transmits an information request command signal to the 

terminal. The terminal transmits information to the receiver 
identifying the type of terminal which is responding. 

Depending on the type of terminal, the receiver may command 
test operations at the terminal and obtain the test results 

therefrom in order to generate and store proper initialization 
information about the terminal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disaster prevention
monitoring apparatus and method which collects terminal
information in response to a call from a receiver end to
collectively monitor an abnormal status such as a fire.An example of a conventional disaster prevention
monitor is disclosed in Examined Japanese Patent Publication
No. HEI. 4-64713. In the disclosed disaster prevention
monitor, when an abnormal status at a terminal, such as when a
terminal fails to reply to a call from a receiver, is detected,
the receiver commands the terminal to transmit information as
to the type of the terminal (hereinafter referred to as "type
information").Specifically, an occasion may occur in which one sensor
is replaced by another sensor of a different type after the
disaster prevention monitor is powered on. When the old sensor
is removed and no reply is made to a call from the receiver,
the receiver commands the terminal to transmit type
information, whereby type information is obtained from the new
sensor and transmitted to the receiver (also referred to as a
central station). In accordance with the type information, the 
receiver again initializes information relating to the sensor
and stored in the receiver.In such a conventional disaster prevention monitor,
however, a plurality of sensors are sequentially called in
accordance with a polling sequence controlled at the receiver.
Where the number of sensors is very large, the polling period
will be very long, and it is possible that a sensor can be
replaced by a new sensor within the time between successive
pollings of the sensor. In such a case, the receiver will not
know that the sensor has been replaced and, as a result, will
not enter a mode to initialize to the new sensor. GB-A-2 254 984 relates to a method of detecting a transmission error in a desaster
prevention supervisory system. In this method, the receiver upon receiving an abnormal
message from one of a plurality of terminal devices proceeds into a transmission error
detection mode and starts a polling sequence to find out the type of terminal which has been
exchanged.It is an object of the present invention to provide a desaster prevention monitor apparatus
and a method for desaster prevention for use in a desaster prevention monitor system,
whereby the replacement of one terminal by another during the period between polling of the
terminal by the receiver will not go unrecognized by the receiver, and the receiver can
properly conduct initialization of information for the new sensor.This object
