<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing an antenna or inductive component comprises producing (eg 
by injection moulding) a former (10) of an electrically insulating material which has a 

groove (12) in its surface. A layer (14) of electrically conducting material is deposited 
over the surface of the former and this layer is then removed from the surfce of the 

former excepting the groove. Hence, the former is left with an electrically conducting 
element extending along the base of the groove.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing electrical components, especially 
antenna components and inductors, and to electrical components manufactured by said 
method. The manufacture of electrical components such as inductances and antenna coils is 
conventionally achieved by winding a wire into a helical form, either around a generally 
cylindrical former or without a former if the mechanical properties of the wire are such 
that it is shape-retaining and self-supporting in the wound condition. In mass production, especially for low inductance values or intended high frequency 
operation in the case of antenna components, the inevitable mechanical tolerances which 
are realistically achievable make it difficult to control the component parameters and 
values. It is a primary aim of this invention to provide an improved method of manufacturing 
electrical components (such as inductance and antenna components) more readily, enabling 
accurate control of component parameters and values. According to the present invention, in its broadest aspect, a method of manufacturing an 
electrical component comprises the steps of producing a former of electrically insulating  
 
material which has a pattern of one or more grooves in its surface, depositing a layer of 
electrically conductive material over the surface of the former, including at least the 
bottom of the or each groove, and removing the conductive layer from the surface of the 
former excepting the groove or grooves. Where the surface of the former is referred to herein, the surface in question may be the 
exterior surface of a solid former, or either the external or the interior surface of a hollow 
former, such as a tubular former. Also according to the present invention, in another aspect, a method of manufacturing an 
antenna or inductive component comprises the steps of producing a former of electrically 
insulating material which has a helical or pseudo-helical groove in its surface, and 
providing a layer of electrically conductive material in the groove but not the remainder 
of the surface of the former. Preferably, although not essentially, in the production of an antenna or inductive 
component, the entire surface of the former is provided with a covering layer of 
conductive material, and the conductive layer is removed except at the helical or pseudo-helical 
groove. The present invention thus enables components to be repeatedly produced which are 
mechanically stable and have precisely controlled parameters and values.
