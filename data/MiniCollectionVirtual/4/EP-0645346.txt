<ABSTRACT>
A body made of carbon particles bonded together with 
a phenolic resin wherein the resin content is about 5% to 

about 35% by weight based on the total weight of carbon 
and resin.

 
A method for making the body involves forming an aqueous 

mixture composed of in percent based on the total weight 
of the activated carbon and phenolic resin about 5% to 

about 35% solid phenolic resin, about 4% to about 10% 
plasticizing organic binder which can be cellulose 

ethers, cellulose ether derivatives, and combinations 
thereof, and the balance of the mixture being activated 

carbon particles, forming the mixture into a body, and 
drying the formed body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to activated carbon bodies 
and method of making them. Activated carbon materials have found use in a 
variety of applications such as gas and liquid adsorption 
applications, for example radon testing, gas masks, sugar 
refining, municipal water treatment, removal of 
microbiological agents, adsorption of volatile organic 
compounds, separation of colloidal or dissolved organic 
substances, etc., mostly in the form of granules. In 
some applications granules have drawbacks, such as back 
pressure of a packed bed, wear of the granules by 
attrition, causing loss of material or bed packing, and 
attrition fines blocking the flow path. Activated carbon can also be extruded to a cellular 
structure such as a honeycomb, or shaped honeycomb by 
extruding fine powder with suitable binders to allow for 
ease of flow of gases through the honeycomb with reduced 
back pressure, or allow easy access of the gases to all 
of the carbon for adsorption of the species to be 
removed. Also, since the honeycomb is a solid piece, 
there should be little or no wear or attrition of the 
carbon. The powder can be mixed with a liquid such as water 
and suitable plasticizers and binders. This plasticized  
 
mixture is then extruded through a die into the honeycomb 
shape, and dried. These bodies often suffer from low strength both in 
the as-extruded state and in the as-dried state. They can 
also develop cracks during the drying procedure, 
especially in large bodies due to differential shrinkage 
because of loss of moisture between the outer surfaces 
and the interior of the body. Also, they lack water 
resistance and deteriorate when exposed to water. Clays and resins have been used as binders in carbon 
mixtures to impart strength to the carbon body formed 
therefrom. U.S. patents 3,825,460, 3,922,412, and 4,399,052, 
GB patent application 2,235,684A, Japanese patent 
application publication 49-115110 (1974), and 55-167118 
(1980) relate to various methods of making carbon bodies 
using phenolic binders, sometimes adding resin before 
activating the carbon. This procedure is complicated as 
it involves carbonisation of the phenolic resin binder, 
thereby destroying its properties. Further methods are 
described by Japanese patent publication No. 55-167118, 
and U.S. patent 3,634,569. It is highly desirable and object of the invention, 
to improve the strength of the extruded honeycomb both in 
the extruded state for further processing and handling 
and also after drying to improve performance, to

A method for making a carbon body having a phenolic 
resin binder, said method comprising: 


a) forming an aqueous mixture comprising in percent 
based on the total weight of the activated carbon and 

phenolic resin, 
   about 5% to about 35% solid phenolic resin, 

   about 4% to about 10% plasticizing organic binder 
selected from the group consisting of cellulose ethers, 

cellulose ether derivatives, and combinations thereof, 
   and the balance of the mixture being activated 

carbon particles; 
b) forming said mixture into a body; and 
c) drying the formed body. 
A method of claim 1 wherein about 50% of the 
activated carbon particles have an average particle size 

of about 5 to about 40 micrometers in diameter as 
measured by Coulter Counter technique. 
A method of claim 1 wherein the resin is phenol 
formaldehyde resin. 
A method of claim 1 wherein said organic binder is 
selected from the group consisting of methylcellulose, 

ethylhydroxy ethylcellulose, hydroxybutylcellulose, 
hydroxybutyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, 

hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl 

methylcellulose, sodium carboxy methylcellulose, and 
mixtures thereof. 
A method of claim 1 wherein the forming is done by 
extruding the mixture, and/or wherein the body is formed 

into a honeycomb structure. 
A method of claim 1 wherein the drying is done 
according to a procedure comprising the steps of: 


i) raising the temperature of the as-formed body to 
a first temperature of no greater than about 90°C without 

allowing the body to lose moisture, 
ii) while the body is at said first temperature, 
slowly removing moisture from the body until the body has 

a moisture content of about 45% to about 65% by weight 
remaining moisture, 
iii) while the body is at said first temperature, 
lowering the humidity to which the body is exposed to 

increase the rate of moisture removal to drop the 
moisture content in the body to no less than about 20% by 

weight of the starting moisture content, and 
iv) heating the body at a second temperature of at 
least about 90°C to cure the resin while maintaining the 

humidity to which the body is exposed so that the 
moisture content in the body does not drop below about 

10% by weight of the starting moisture content. 
A method of claim 6 wherein 
   step i is carried out by placing the as-formed body 

in a humidity-controlled atmosphere at a first relative 
humidity of about 92% to about 98% and a first 

temperature of about 60°C to about 90°C and allowing the 
body to remain at said first relative humidity for a 

period of time sufficient to allow the body to reach said 
first temperature without losing a significant amount of 

its starting moisture content; 
   step ii is carried out by removing an amount of 

moisture from said body equal to about 0.5 to about 1.5% 
by weight of the starting moisture content of said body 

per hour, until the moisture content of said body is 
about 45% to about 65% by weight of said starting 

moisture content, 
   step iii is carried out by lowering the relative 

humidity in said atmosphere to a second relative humidity 
 

of about 40% to about 65%, and 
   step iv is carried out by heating the body at a 

second temperature of about 90°C to about 98°C at the 
second relative humidity level.
