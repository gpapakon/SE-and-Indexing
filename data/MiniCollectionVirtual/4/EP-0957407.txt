<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for
various recording methods, such as those based on
electrophotography, electrostatic recording, magnetic
recording and toner jet recording, more particularly to
a toner useful for copiers, printers and facsimiles in
which a toner image is formed on an electrostatic
latent image carrier and the toner image is transferred
onto a medium to form the final image.A number of electrophotographic methods have been
proposed. They generally use a photoconductive
material to form an electrical latent image on an image
carrier (photosensitive member) by various methods,
which is developed by a toner into a visible image,
transferred, as required, onto transfer medium such as
paper or other media, and fixed into the toner image on
the above medium by heat, pressure or the like, for
copying the image.Methods to visualize an electrical latent image
include cascade, magnetic-brush and pressurization
development. Another method uses a magnetic toner,
which is scattered by an electric field in a space
between a photosensitive member and sleeve using a 
rotating sleeve with a magnetic pole at the center.The one-component developing method, dispensing
with carrier particles, e.g., glass beads and iron
powders, which are necessary for the two-component
method, reduces size and weight of the developing
device itself. Moreover, the two-component developing
method needs concentration of the toner in the carrier
to be kept at a constant level, and hence a device
which senses the toner concentration and supplies a
required quantity of the toner. This further increases
size and weight of the developing device. The one-component
method does not need such device, and
therefore, is more desirable also in this respect.Recently, the printing devices have been mainly
represented by LED and LBP printers, for which
techniques are increasingly demanded to improve
resolution from the traditional level of 240 or 300 dpi
to 400, 600 and further to 800 dpi. The development
method is also demanded to be more precise,
accordingly. The copier is also becoming more
functional, and advancing in the direction of
digitalization. This direction is mainly associated
with laser-aided formation of electrostatic images, and
also demands development methods of higher resolution
and precision, as is the case with printers. The toner
particles, therefore, are becoming smaller. The
smaller toner particles having a specific size 
distribution have been developed, as disclosed by
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
