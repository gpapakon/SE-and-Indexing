<ABSTRACT>
A miniature and high performance antenna applicable to 
a radio communication apparatus and made up of a straight 

antenna rod and a loading coil (30). The tip of the straight antenna 
rod (20) is received in the coil (30) such that capacity coupling is set 

up between them. Means is provided for setting up capacity 
coupling between the antenna rod and a feed portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a miniature and high
performance antenna applicable to a radio communication
apparatus and made up of a straight antenna rod and a coiled
element.Portable radio communication apparatuses, including
hand-held telephones, are extensively used today. To enhance
portability, the casing of this kind of apparatus is decreasing
in size and weight. An antenna small enough to be retracted
even into such a small casing has been proposed in various
forms. The prerequisite with the apparatus is that it can
respond to a call originated on a remote station even when the
small antenna is retracted into the casing. Further, there is
an increasing demand for higher antenna sensitivity. In the
light of this, it has been customary to provide the apparatus
with a built-in antenna in addition to the retractable antenna
and use them selectively. However, the problem with this
approach is that the apparatus has a complicated and bulky
construction. To eliminate this problem, when the antenna is
retracted into the casing, a loading coil portion associated 
with the antenna may be directly fed to insure sensitivity, as
taught in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication
(Kokai) Nos. 1-101702 and 1-101703. Antennas aiming at
miniaturization are disclosed in, for example, Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 3-245603 and EP Publication
No. 0 467 822.WO 92/16980 relates to an antenna construction with an extensible
antenna element. An antenna construction with a
rod-shaped antenna element is adapted for use preferably in
portable telephones. The rod-shaped antenna element is adapted
to be slidably movable in a tube between a first position
in which substantially the entire rod-shaped antenna
element protrudes from the tube and contributes to radiation,
and a second position where just part of the rod-shaped
antenna element protrudes from the tube and contributes
to radiation. The rod-shaped antenna element is adapted
to be received in the tube to provide a coaxial transmission
line. However, the conventional antennas are complicated in
structure and, therefore, difficult to produce, resulting in an
increase in production cost. Moreover. a part of metallic
members included in the antenna are exposed to the outside,
impairing the appearance of the apparatus. In addition, when
a part of the human body touches or even approaches the
exposed portion of the antenna, frequency changes.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to
provide an antenna for a radio communication
