<ABSTRACT>
A nozzle apparatus for producing aerosol from a substance 

includes a delivery line (120) having an inlet for receiving the 
substance at a first pressure. A nozzle (102) is connected to the 

delivery line (120) for receiving the substance from the delivery 
line (120). 

The nozzle (102) has at least one exit opening (165) which allows 
passing of 

the substance therethrough for expanding the substance from the 
first pressure to a second pressure which is lower than the first 

pressure for solidifying the substance and producing aerosol. 
Condensation preventing means (125) is provided for preventing 

condensation from forming on the delivery line (120) and/or on the 
nozzle (102).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to production of
cryogenic aerosol and, more particularly, to surface cleaning
using a cryogenic aerosol.Surface contamination is a widespread concern in many
industries. Such contamination can result in production of
inferior or non-operating products, or considerably lower product
yields. For instance, as a specific example, surface
contamination is a prevalent problem in the microelectronics
processing industry, and can take the form of unwanted particles,
films, molecules, or the like; and the surfaces that can be
contaminated include those of semiconductor wafers, displays,
microelectronic components, etc. Contamination of these surfaces
can cause various types of defects to develop, including short
circuits, open circuits, stacking faults, among others. These
defects can adversely affect circuits, and ultimately cause
entire chips to fail.Another type of surface that has contaminants that are
required to be removed are the walls of tool or processing
chambers, such as plasma etch and chemical vapor deposition
reactors. Reaction residues and/or polymers generated during
semiconductor processing tend to deposit on the chamber walls.
These residues and/or polymers can subsequently flake off onto
products being processed or onto subsequently processed products.
In order to prevent yield loss due to this mechanism, 
manufacturing processing chambers have to be disassembled
periodically to be cleaned or "wiped down". Current practice
involves weekly disassembly of the fixtures inside the chamber
and wipe down of all the surfaces with a mixture of alcohol and
water. This periodic machine disassembly, wipe down, and re-assembly,
and the required long pump-down times after cleaning
for surface drying, severely reduces the production and
reliability of the processing equipment. In addition, the acidic
fumes formed when the deposited material reacts with water often
creates a health hazard for cleaning personnel.U.S. Patent No. 5,108,512, issued April 28, 1992, to
Goffnett et al., relates to cleaning a chemical vapor deposition
reactor used in the production of polycrystalline silicon by
impacting with carbon dioxide pellets. Goffnett et al. discloses
delivering carbon dioxide gas to a pelletizer where the gas is
compressed and formed into solid carbon dioxide pellets. The
pellets, along with an accelerant gas for increasing the velocity
of the pellets, are delivered to a nozzle. The nozzle is a
"venturi" nozzle which maximizes the velocity at which the
pellets are
