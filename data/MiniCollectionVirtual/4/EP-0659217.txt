<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the cloning of
the receptor for the carboxy-terminus of the β-amyloid
precursor protein (including the amyloid domain),
referred to herein as C100-R, and genetically
engineered host cells which express the C100-R. Such
engineered cells may be used to evaluate and screen
drugs and analogs of the β-amyloid precursor protein
(β-APP) which may be used for the diagnosis and/or
treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative
disorder that is the most frequent cause of dementia
among aged individuals. The disease is characterized
by the accumulation of amyloid-containing plaques in
the brain, particularly in the temporal cortex and
hippocampus and along the walls of the cerebral vasculature
(Roch et al., 1966, Nature 209:109-110; Terry
et al., 1981, Ann. Neurol. 10:184-192; Glenner G.G.,
1983, Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 107:281-282; Katzman,
R., 1983, Banbury Report 15, Cold Spring Harbor Lab.,
Cold Spring, N.Y.).The amyloid peptide (βA4), found in the plaques
of the brain derives from a protein referred to as the
amyloid (or beta-amyloid) precursor protein (βAPP).
βAPP is normally cleaved within the amyloid domain,
which lies near its C-terminus, so that no intact
amyloid is produced. An alternative processing
pathway results in cleavage of βAPP N-terminal to the
amyloid domain, releasing the entire C-terminal from
which intact amyloid peptide (βA4) of the amyloid
protein precursor may be produced (Glenner and Wong,
1984, Biochem Biophys Res. Commun. 120:885-890; 
Masters et al., 1985, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA
82:4245-4249).Recent evidence suggests that aberrant processing
of β-APP underlies the neuronal degeneration that
occurs in Alzheimer's Disease. Neve and coworkers
have proposed that the primary βAPP processing event
in Alzheimer's Disease is cleavage of the amino
terminus of the β/A4 sequence, producing a carboxy-terminal
βAPP fragment of 100 amino acid residues
(βAPP-C100) which was expressed from a cDNA sequence
encoding the carboxyterminal 104 amino acids of βAPP
(Yankner et al., 1989, Science 245:417-420).
Hereinafter, this fragment of βAPP will be referred to
as βAPP-C100 regardless of whether it is expressed
from a cDNA encoding the carboxyterminal 100 or 104
amino acid residues of βAPP. Expression of the βAPP-C100
peptide in primate cells has been shown to lead
to production of a protein that aggregates and accumulates
into deposit-like structures that result in
formation of amyloid-like fibrils (Wolf et al., 1990
EMBO J. 9:2079-2084). A
