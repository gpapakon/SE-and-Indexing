<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for use in the
assay of chemical or biochemical entities, and in
particular to a biosensor for the detection of enzymes
or enzyme substrates.Enzyme-based sensors (enzyme electrodes) have
previously been produced for the detection of a wide
variety of analytes, one instance being sensors for the
measurement of blood-gas concentrations (Clarke and
Lyons, Annals of the New York Academy of Science,
Vol.102, pp 29-45, 1962). Many such biosensors employ
an enzyme whose catalytic reaction results in a pH
change which is recorded using either amperometric or
potentiometric electrodes. The concentration of the
analyte of interest is monitored by studying the rate of
change or the absolute change in pH. To improve both
the analytical performance and operational stability of
such devices, the enzyme is frequently immobilised
behind a semi-permeable membrane at the surface of the
pH electrode. Analytes studied in this way include
penicillin (Guilbault, G.G, Handbook of Immobilised
Enzymes, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1984) and glucose
(Clarke and Lyons, 1962). Advances in the field of
microelectronics led to attempts to miniaturise these pH
based enzyme sensor electrodes, substituting the
conventional macro-pH electrode with a very much smaller
pH sensitive ion selective field effect transistor
(ISFET). Sensors for penicillin and glucose have been
fabricated using such technology and are reviewed in the
literature (Biosensors: Fundamentals and Applications,
edited by A.P.F. Turner, I. Karube, G.S. Wilson, Oxford
Scientific Publications, 1987).However, such potentiometric systems suffer from a
number of disadvantages; for example they are prone to 
electrical noise and interference due to other ions
present in the sample. Attempts have therefore been
made to fabricate the equivalents of such devices for
use in optical technology.Patent abstracts of Japan, Col. 14, 021 (P-990)
discloses a fibrous sensor which contains a substance
capable of changing colour through reaction with an
analyte.A sensor for penicillin has been reported (Kulp
T.J. etal, Analytical Chemistry, Vol.59, pp 2849-2853
1987) which employs an optical fibre, the end of which
is coated with a polymer into which is incorporated or
to which is bound a penicillinase and a pH-dependent
fluorescent dye. As the enzyme reacts with its
substrate, the change in optical properties of the dye
is measured and this change gives a measurement of the
substrate concentration. Such a device, however,
suffers from a number of
