<ABSTRACT>
A device for dehydrating and/or embedding preferably frozen samples, consisting of a dewar vessel (1) filled with liquid nitrogen (2) and a metal component (4) of a good heat conducting material secured to the base, the upper end of which in the base region of the dewar vessel neck has a cover (5) with a metal cooling surface (6, 7) which corresponds to matching lower contact surfaces of the thermostatically heated (9, 10) substitution (PLT) container (8) or the lower part of a freeze-drying chamber in such a way as to ensure good heat transfer between the corresponding surfaces.

Device for dehydrating and/or embedding
samples (31, 31'), in particular at temperatures

between +20°C and -120°C, in a substitution container
(8, 8') with thermostatically controlled temperature

(9, 10) in a Dewar vessel (1) containing liquid
nitrogen (2), there being arranged in the Dewar vessel

(1) a fixed metal cooling surface (6, 7), which is
securely connected to the said vessel and is cooled by

liquid nitrogen (2), the substitution container (8)
being connected to the cooling surface (6, 7) and the

substitution container (8) having inserts (29, 33) for
the samples (31, 31'), characterized in that between

the substitution container (8) and the cooling surface
(6, 7) there is provided a complementary contact

surface (42, 43, 43', 43"), by means of which the
substitution container (8), which is suitable for the

PLT method, is designed such that it is detachable from
the cooling surface (6, 7), the contact surface (42,

43, 43', 43") bearing against the cooling surface (6,
7) when the substitution container (8) is inserted, and

consequently ensuring a good heat transfer between the
fixed cooling surface (6, 7) and the contact surface

(42, 43, 43', 43") complementary to it, and the
substitution container (8) being exchangeable together

with the inserts (29, 33) for another substitution
container (8') with an insert (37) or for an evacuable

container (40) with a freeze-drying chamber and an
insert (44). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the substitution container (8, 8') is designed for

receiving liquid substitution or dehydration media or
monomers.
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that in the Dewar vessel (1) there is

fastened a tube (4) of a metal (3) which conducts heat
well, the upper end of which, as a cover (5), is

provided with a refilling opening (6) for liquid
nitrogen (2), the preferably planar horizontal upper

side (7) of the cover (5) and/or the cylindrical
refilling opening (6) representing the cooling surfaces

for cooling the containers (8, 8', 40).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the essentially cylindrically

designed substitution (PLT) container (8, 8') comprises
a thermostatically heatable vessel, a large part of the

underside of which, preferably over 90%, is covered by
a planar thermally insulating layer (12, 12').
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the thermally insulating layer (12, 12') consists

of a foam plastic, for example styrene or polyurethane
foam.
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized
in that the planar underside of the thermally

insulating layer (12) is covered by a metal disc (13).
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in
that between the substitution container (8, 8') and the

cover (5) there is a cylindrical rod (53) or a
cylindrical sleeve (39), which rod or sleeve has good

thermal contact with both elements (8, 8', 5, 11).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the substitution container (8') has for receiving

the sample containers (37) with the samples (31, 31')
on its upper side an annular groove (36) and in its

centre a refilling opening (35) for liquid nitrogen
(2), which corresponds to the refilling opening (6) in

the cover (5). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the neck of the Dewar vessel (1)

may be closed by a cover (18, 20, 22), which is
horizontally moveable and has for its part two plates

(22, 20), of which the lower plate (20) has a diameter
which allows it to be vertically moveable up and down

in the neck of the Dewar vessel.
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the two plates (20, 22) consist of a transparent

material, which is preferably UV-transmissive.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that at the upper end of the neck of

the Dewar vessel there is arranged an annular suction
removal means (24, 25), which receives the gas escaping

from the interior of the Dewar vessel and leads it away
by means of an exhaustor (26, 27) through a tube (28).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the evacuable container (40, 49-51) with the

freeze-drying chamber is cylindrically designed, the
bottom surface (42, 43") corresponding to the cover (5)

in such a way that a good heat transfer between the two
corresponding surfaces is ensured by a complementary

design of the surfaces (7/42 and 6/43").
Device according to Claim 12, characterized in
that both the thermostatically heated sample holding

device (9, 10, 44) and the condensation surfaces
(40, 47) are cooled to the respectively required

temperatures exclusively by means of liquid nitrogen
(2) via metal intermediate elements (4, 5).
