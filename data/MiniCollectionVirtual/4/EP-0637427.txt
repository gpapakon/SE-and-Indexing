<ABSTRACT>
A cap for staves as used for constructing stave 
bedsteads having a cavity (12) provided with two 

openings (14') which are located on two opposite side 
walls (14) and are designed to receive and to 

snappingly interact with two projections (16) provided 
on opposite stave sides so as to prevent any sliding 

motion between cap and stave once they are coupled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a terminal cap for 
staves as used for constructing stave bedsteads. Terminal caps in different forms, provided or not 
with head or base pins for anchoring the staves to a 
bedstead, are usually applied to both ends of bedstead 
staves. At present, the said terminal caps are simply 
fitted on stave ends or fixed thereto by nails or 
screws. However, the absence of fixing does not ensure 
adequate union between cap and stave; on the other 
hand, fixing by nails or screws entails the use of 
specific equipment and labour, and consequently further 
expenses.  In another known arrangement, terminal caps are 
fixed to staves by means of a tooth provided inside the 
cap, which is introduced into a hole provided in the 
stave. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a terminal cap for staves in a new configuration and 
free from any inside teeth, which can be conveniently 
and quickly coupled to a stave without any tools and 
engaging with the stave sides through a snapping 
connection. For the said purpose, the cap proposed by this 
invention comprises a moulded plastic body defining a 
cavity designed to receive a stave end and having two 
openings located on the walls beside the said cavity, 
in which two corresponding projections provided on the 
stave sides will snap in so as to prevent any sliding 
motion between cap and stave once they have been 
coupled. One embodiment and a way of application of a cap 
according to this invention are illustrated by way of 
indicative and non-limitative example in the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a cap with fixing 
pins, though the said pins are not indispensable and 
might therefore be omitted;  Figure 2 shows the cap viewed from the opening provided 
in it for receiving a stave; Figure 3 show a partial sectional view of the cap, as 
viewed from above; Figure 4 show a stave terminal portion; and Figures 5 and 6 show the cap applied to a stave 
according to two different sectional views. The cap according to the invention comprises a 
moulded plastic body 10 having - though not necessarily 
- two pins 11 on its base or head wall. The body 10 
defines a cavity 12 open on one side 12' and designed 
to receive the end of a bedstead stave 13. The cavity 12 is defined laterally by two side 
walls 14, each provided with an opening 14'. The stave 13 is provided with chamfered ends and 
with a cavity or notch 15 on each side thereof which 
defines a projection 16 towards the stave ends,

<CLAIMS>
A cap for staves as used for constructing stave 
bedsteads comprising a plastic body (10) defining a 

cavity (12) open on one side (12') and designed to 
receive the end of a stave (13), characterized in that 

two openings (14') are provided on opposite side walls 
(14) of the said cavity (12) in order to receive and 

snappingly interact with two projections (16) provided 
on opposite stave sides so as to prevent any sliding 

motion between cap and stave once they are coupled. 
A cap as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
projections (16) on the stave sides are defined by 

cavities (15), the said projections being designed to 
be introduced into the openings (14') of the cap side 

walls whereas the side cavities (15) receive the solid 
parts of the cap side walls. 
A cap as claimed in the previous claims, wherein 
the body (10) may be provided or not with anchorage 

pins.
