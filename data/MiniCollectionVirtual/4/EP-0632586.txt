<ABSTRACT>
Device (10) for automatic control of sounds comprising detection means (14) delivering objective measurements of sounds and/or of noises relating to an ambient sound volume, and control means (18) with fuzzy logic for adjusting the characteristics of sound emission which is delivered by acoustic equipment (5), according to the ambient noise measurements. The device comprises, between the detection means (14) and the control means (18), conversion means (16) with fuzzy logic which convert the objective measurements of the ambient noise into subjective measurements of the ambient noise in order to operate the said adjustments. The device can learn rules which are personalised for one listener. It can also detect speech and carry out specific adjustments. Application: car radio, sound reproduction apparatus, television set.
