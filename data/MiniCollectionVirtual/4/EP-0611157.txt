<ABSTRACT>
Method for making available a desired nucleic acid 
contained in a biological sample, comprising the steps of 

acidifying said biological sample to a pH at which 
endogenous nucleases capable of degrading the desired 

nucleic acid(s) are inactive, contacting said biological 
sample with an exogenous acid protease active at said pH, 

incubating said sample until endogenous nuclease 
activities are reduced to insignificant levels, and 

raising the pH of the biological sample to a pH sufficient 
to render the exogenous protease less active.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to procedures for
treating biological specimens to make their nucleic acids
available for various purposes, such as nucleic acid
hybridization assays for the diagnosis of disease and
other purposes, and for amplification of nucleic acids by
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other target
amplification procedures. Specifically, the present
invention relates to convenient procedures for making
nucleic acids available that prevent degradation of the
nucleic acids by endogenous nucleases present in the
biological sample.Many diagnostic procedures are based on detection of
specific nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) sequences present in a
biological sample. For example, the sample may contain
bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms whose presence
must be ascertained to determine the cause of an
infectious disease. In other instances, the nucleic acid
sequence may be sought within the DNA of a human white
blood cell in order to establish the presence of a
mutation associated with cancer or a genetic disease.For such a diagnostic analyses, it is necessary to
make available the specific nucleic acid that may be
present in the sample. Frequently, the nucleic acid will
be contained within a bacterium, fungus, virus, or other
microorganism or within human cells such as white blood
cells. It may further be contained within other
structures such as ribosomes, plasmids, or chromosomal
DNA. In order to perform hybridization reactions to
detect specific nucleic acids or to amplify them using PCR 
or other target amplification methods, the nucleic acid
must be released from these organisms and/or structures.Unfortunately, such release exposes the nucleic acids
to degradation by endogenous nucleases present in the
sample, which may exist in such abundance that the nucleic
acid is almost instantaneously destroyed.The problem is particularly acute when the specific
nucleic acid is an RNA, since RNAses are abundant in most
biological samples and are often extremely resistant to
treatments that readily inactivate many other enzymes.To deal with this problem, it is common in the art to
employ a variety of means to purify the nucleic acids from
the biological sample. For example, anionic detergents
and chaotropic agents such as guanidinium salts have been
used to simultaneously inactivate or inhibit nuclease
activities and release nucleic acids from within cells and
subcellular structures. Unfortunately, these agents are
also potent inhibitors of the enzymes used in target
amplification processes or
