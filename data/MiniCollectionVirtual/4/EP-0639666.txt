<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to maximizing the brightness of 
wood pulps bleached or brightened with bleaching agents, 
especially anionic bleaching agents so that brighter pulps 
may be obtained. This invention more particularly relates 
to maximizing the brightening of high-yield wood pulps used 
for newsprint and magazines. Wood pulps can be classified as chemical pulps or 
high-yield pulps. Chemical pulps are prepared by 
chemically dissolving the non-cellulosic portion of the 
wood, such as lignins and hemicellulose. The process 
results in a purified wood pulp composed of 80-100 percent 
cellulose. High-yield wood pulps leave the bulk of the 
non-cellulosic components of the wood with the fiber 
because separation of the wood material into fibers occurs 
mainly through mechanical attrition of the wood, and 
contains up to about 60 percent cellulose. High yield wood pulps are comprised of groundwood (GW) 
and refiner mechanical pulps (RMP). Stone groundwood pulp 
is produced by pressing logs against an abrasive rotating 
grindstone. Pressurized groundwood (PGW) is made by a 
modification to the stone grinding process; the logs are  
 
ground in a pressurized atmosphere to prevent the flashing 
of steam and to increase the temperature used in the 
grinding process. Refiner mechanical pulps are produced by grinding wood 
chips between rotating grooved discs. Wood chips are 
introduced into the open eye of the refiner. As wood mass 
moves from the center of the refiner to the periphery, the 
wood is broken down into progressively smaller particles 
and finally into fibers. Thermomechanical pulping (TMP) is a modification of 
the RMP process which involves steaming the wood chips for 
a short period of time prior to refining. Frequently both 
the heating and refining stages are done under pressure, 
but some pulping systems refine under atmospheric pressure 
(TRMP). Chemical treatments prior to refining or during 
the heating stage are further modifications of these 
pulping systems. High-yield wood pulps are desirable for their low 
manufacturing costs and generally satisfactory physical 
properties. Their preparation involves very little loss of 
the original wood, and production processes typically are 
less expensive than chemical pulps. High-yield wood pulps 
are commonly used in newsprint, printing papers, molded 
products, corrugated paper, boxboards, and other 
applications.  
 While retaining the bulk of the wood material is 
economically favored, high-yield wood pulps tend to be dark 
and require
