<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the depositing of the fibre-sliver end after the filling of a flat can. The object of the invention is, in the region of the filling station, to deposit and prepare the sliver end at a filled flat can, in order, with the least possible outlay, to facilitate an automatic handling of the flat can during transport and an automatic handling of the sliver end at a spinning machine. The invention proceeds from the fact that the positions between the mouth (15) of the turntable (12), separator (18) and flat can (1) are adjustable relative to one another and, by means of this selected adjustment, influence is exerted on the depositing point of the sliver end and on the length of the sliver end.

A method of depositing a sliver end on a flat-top can (1; 140), in which sliver is conveyed
by a pair of calender rollers (16; 600, 600') into a sliver-guide channel (14; 800) of

a turntable (12; 700) and is deposited in a cycloidal manner in the flat-top can (1; 140),
the filled flat-top can (1; 140) is displaced from a traversing path on a displacement path

(
V
; 
VW
) if the end wall of the flat-top can (1; 140) is positioned in the vicinity of the
turntable (12; 700), and the sliver is severed and the sliver end is deposited in the region

of the end wall of the flat-top can (1; 140), 
characterized in that
 when the flat-top can
(1; 140) is filled the rotation of the pair of calender rollers (16; 600, 600') and of the

turntable (12; 700) is stopped, so that during the stoppage the opening (15; 90) of the
turntable (12; 700) occupies a defined position with respect to the end wall of the flat-top

can (1; 140), and the severing of the sliver is set before the displacement of the flat-top
can (1; 140) or after the displacement of the flat-top can (1; 140) on the displacement

path (
V
; 
VW
).
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the flat-top can (1; 140) is
stopped on the traversing path in a stoppage position (
D
; 
SP
) before the severing of the
sliver or before the positioning of the opening (15; 90) of the turntable (12; 700).
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the length of the displacement
path (
V
; 
VW
) is adjustable.
A method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the opening
(15) of the turntable (12) is positioned in such a way with respect to an adjustable stop-page

position (
D
) of the flat-top can (1) that during the displacement of the flat-top can
(1) loops of sliver are drawn off in such a way that at the end of the displacement path

(
V
) the sliver arrives at the central region of the end face of the flat-top can (1) and is
then severed by a severing means (18), so that the sliver end is deposited in the central

region of the end wall.
A method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the stoppage position (
D
) of the
flat-top can (1) is set by the trailing time of the opening (15) of the turntable (12) from a

braking position (
C
) of the flat-top can (1) until the stoppage of the flat-top can (1).
A method according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 a control means (40) calculates 
the trailing time and emits a signal for braking the flat-top can (1).
A method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the width of the central region of
the end wall of the flat-top can (1) is determined by the length of the displacement path

(
V
).
A method according to one or both of Claims 4 and 7, 
characterized in that
 the displacement
path (
V
) is adjustable, so that the sliver drawn off is deposited above the loops
of the sliver.
A method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the severing means (18) has a
fixed position with respect to the severing position (
E
) of the flat-top can (1) inside the
displacement path (
V
).
A method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the severing means (18) has a
variable and adjustable position with respect to the severing position (
E
) of the flat-top
can (1) inside the displacement path (
V
), in order to be able to vary the length of the
sliver end to be deposited.
A method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the flat-top
can (140) occupies an adjustable stoppage position (
SP

severed between the pair of calender rollers (600, 600') and the sliver-guide channel
(800), and, by subsequent displacement of the flat-top can (140) out of the stoppage position
