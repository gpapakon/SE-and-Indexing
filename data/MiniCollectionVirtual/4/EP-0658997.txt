<ABSTRACT>
The present invention comprises a method and a system by which mobile,
remote, adaptable controllers can dynamically control a multitude of

resources within a given region (e.g. a room) such that policies determined
for the region, controllers, and resources can be arbitrated in a manner that

creates a meaningful work environment for users in the region.
Furthermore, the present invention allows a controller to dynamically

choose one of various modes of operation, either singly or in combination,
allowing the user of the controller a maximum of flexibility in interacting

with the resources in the region. These modes of operation comprise, but are
not limited, to: a manual mode whereby a user may select a list of available

resources that meet region-level policy and two automatic modes whereby
controllers and resources may, without direct user input, make requests and

allocation based on region-level policy and other constraints. The present
invention maximizes the control of the resources of a region such that the

control of the most suitable resources is dynamically situated in the hands of
the user on an adaptable mobile controller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a method and a system for
allowing certain devices to control other devices and, in particular, to a
method and a system for the dynamic selection, allocation and arbitration of
control of devices within a proximal region.The usefulness of any given device is determined in part by the degrees of
freedom provided by the control mechanisms for the device. For example, a
light that merely has an on/off switch is not as versatile as a light that
allows an entire range of illumination through a dimmer switch. Systems
that supply a wide range of control options and mechanisms are generally
more desirable from a user's standpoint.Conceptually, controllers may be broken down into a variety of broad
categories. Controllers may either be physically attached to the controlled
device or they may be remote and control the device from a distance.
Controllers may be either dedicated to control a single device or adaptable to
control a variety of different devices. Remote, adaptable controllers
generally allow the user a greater range of use than dedicated, attached
controllers. From across the room, a viewer is able to switch channels on a 
television set with a dedicated remote controller without physical exertion.
Such a viewer might be better served by an adaptable controller that could
also control other devices such as lighting, room temperature, stereo, and
the like.As user environments become more complex, the need for more versatile
control mechanisms becomes greater. Users would like to feel that the
devices at their disposal exist to aid them in their tasks - not monopolize
their attention. In a sense, the best controller is one that provides the user
the greatest range of functionality without requiring a great deal of
conscious effort. That is, the more the control features blend into the
background or become tacit, the better.Current environments that facilitate human interactions, such as
workplaces, homes, airports, commercial areas and the like, have seen
increasing complexity and automation. Today, a typical environment may
include many resources such as workstations, telephones, televisions,
stereos, radios, VCRs, fax machines, printers, copiers, scanners, modems,
and the like. These relatively new computational and communication
resources supplement other environmental resources typically found in
work and living spaces , such as lighting, air conditioning and the like. It is
desirable from a user standpoint that all of these devices work together to
create

<CLAIMS>
A method for servicing requests for resources (42) by controllers (40) located
in a proximal region, said region having a set of interaction policies (72) that

constrain the granting of said request and where said controllers located in
said region defines a first membership set (52) and said resources in said region

defines a second membership set (58), said method comprising the steps
of:


A) identifying controller and resource presence within the region to define said
first and said second membership sets, including dynamically updating said

first and said second membership sets as controllers and resources enter and
exit said region;
B) registering interaction requests made by controller located in the region;
C) identifying contextual attributes of each of said interaction requests;
D) granting interaction requests that have contextual attributes that are consistent
with said region interaction policies; and
E) denying interaction requests that have contextual attributes that are inconsistent
with said region interaction policies.
A computer system for servicing requests for resources (42) made by controllers
(40), said resources (42) and said controllers (40) being located in a

proximal region having a set of interaction policies (72) that constrain the
granting of said requests and where said controllers located in said region

define a first membership set (52) and said resources in said region defines a
second membership set (58), said system comprising: 


a means for identifying controller and resource presence within the region to
define said first and said second membership sets;
a means for dynamically updating said first and said second membership sets
as controllers and resources enter and exit said region;
a means for registering interaction requests made by said controllers;
a means for identifying contextual attributes of each of said interaction requests;
a means for granting interaction requests that have contextual attributes that
are consistent with said region interaction policies; and
a means for denying interaction requests that have contextual attributes that
are inconsistent with said region interaction policies.
