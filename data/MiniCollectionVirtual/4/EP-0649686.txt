<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a rolling mill with axial shifting, of the type comprising, inside a stand (1), at least two superposed rolls (2, 2') each carried by two bearings (journals) (22) each mounted in a chock and means for controlling the shift of at least one of the rolls (2) parallel to its axis, each bearing (22) of the shiftable roll (2) being mounted so as to slide axially inside the chock (3) and at least one of the said bearings (22) comprising an end part (24) on which the said axial-shift means (5) bear, by means of a drive member (4). According to the invention, at least one of the working rolls (2) having an adjustable height, the means (5) for controlling the axial shift of at least the said adjustable-height roll (2) are connected, in a removable fashion, to the means (4) for driving the said roll (2) and are placed on a support (6) which is mounted so as to slide along the corresponding upright (11) of the stand (1), between a moved-away position and a drive position which can be adjusted to the level of the shiftable roll (2).

referencing the position of said support (6), and with
means (66) for commanding the sliding of the support (6)

along the upright (11) according to the indications from
the sensor (67) for the adjustment of the position of

said support (6) to the level of the roll (2) to be
axially displaced and the engagement of axial

displacement command means (5) with a drive element (4)
rigidly locked axially with the roll (2) with the

possibility of rotation. 
The rolling mill according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
