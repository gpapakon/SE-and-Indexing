<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and
apparatus for regulating lasers. More particularly,
the present invention relates to methods and apparatus
for regulating laser diodes.Simulated emission from a GaAs semiconductor diode
laser was first observed in the early 1960's. In the
intervening years, the semiconductor diode laser (the
"laser diode") has come to dominate the laser field in
its technological importance. It has become the key
element in an increasing number of applications, most
notably in optical fiber communication and optical data
storage. This "success" is due to the fact that
semiconductor lasers can be simply pumped by passing a
current through them at voltage and current levels that
are compatible with those of integrated circuits, and
because they can be modulated directly at frequencies
in excess of 20GHz. Laser diodes can also be 
conveniently made because they can be mass-produced by
the same photolithographic techniques as electronic
circuits and because they can be integrated
monolithically with those circuits.Laser diodes are not without shortcomings,
however. For example, laser diodes typically
demonstrate strong non-linear characteristics for
variations in operating temperature. Thus, the optical
output intensity of a laser diode is difficult to
regulate during variations in operating temperature.
Laser diodes are also known to present considerable
variations of the light power emitted over time, that
is, as the laser diodes age.To moderate the intensity of these variations, it
is necessary to provide for regulation of the output
light power. Processes are already known for
regulating the light power emitted by a laser diode
under continuous operating conditions in which an
electric signal representative of the light power is
compared with an electric reference signal
corresponding to a reference power. These processes
include means for generating an error signal if
appropriate, and for automatically modifying the
operating conditions of the laser diode upon generation
of such an error signal.Typically, prior art automatic power controls
supply a bias current that is set at approximately the
threshold current level of the laser diode. In this
manner, when a pulse current is added to the bias
current, the laser diode is effectively switched
between a high and low optical output intensity
corresponding to the wave form of the pulse current.
The supplied bias current is controllably varied to be
approximately at the threshold current level of the
laser diode, particularly
