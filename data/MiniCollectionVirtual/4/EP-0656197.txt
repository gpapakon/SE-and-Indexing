<ABSTRACT>
An artificial body vessel to be inserted into a human organ is 
collapsed and introduced into a catheter, which is brought to a required 

position in the human organ, where the artificial body vessel is 
released therefrom. A pair of foldable, elastic wire rings 10 are 

provided at the opposite ends of the artificial body vessel. A 
plurality of connecting wire rings bridge the end wire rings 10. A 

plurality of intermediate wire rings 12 bind and keep the connecting 
wire rings 11 transformed to a generally elliptical shape. The end 

wire rings 10, the intermediate wire rings 12 and the connecting wire 
rings 11 are folded thereby to collapse the artificial body vessel 7. 

The collapsed artificial body vessel 7 is inserted into a catheter. 
At the objective position of the blood vessel the artificial body 

vessel 7 is released, so that the resiliency of the end wire rings 10, 
the intermediate wire rings 12 and the connecting wire rings 11 

restores the artificial body vessel 7 to its original tubular shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of collapsing an
appliance for subsequent impantation in a human organ as specified in Claim 1.At present, treatment of, say, aortic aneurysms is
conducted by implanting artificial blood vessels. In
particular, the portion of a blood vessel which has an aneurysm
is removed by resection, and an artificial blood vessel is
implanted in place of the resected portion and connected to the
remaining blood vessel by suturing.The above mentioned method of surgically implanting
artificial blood vessels for treatment of aortic aneurysms,
however, is highly dangerous. Especially, emergency operation
for treatment of a ruptured aneurysms has a low life-saving
rate, and operation on dissecting arotic aneurisms is difficult
and has a high death rate.The present invention has been accomplished to solve the
above-mentioned problems encountered in the prior art. The
object of the present invention is to provide a method for
collapsing an appliance for subsequent introduction into a human body. An advantage of the
invention is that an appliance is provided which is collapsible
for insertion into human organs, such as a blood vessel, and
which can be brought to an affected or constricted part
thereof, where the appliance is released so as to be expanded
and implanted there without fail. Another object of the
invention is to make it easy to collapse the appliance and
introduce it into a 
catheter for insertion into a human organ.The appliance collapsible for insertion into human organs and
capable of resilient restoration to be used in accordance with the method of the invention
is characterized by that a pair of foldable, elastic end wire
rings are provided at opposite ends; that a plurality of foldable,
elastic connecting wire rings having a generally circular shape
when no external force is applied thereto are provided to bridge
the opposite end wire rings and fixed thereto; and that a plurality
of intermediate wire rings are provided between the opposite
end wire rings so as to keep the connecting wire rings resiliently
transformed to a generally elliptical shape.A plurality of loops for pull strings to be passed through
may be provided at a plurality of points which divide the circumference
of each of the opposite end wire rings.The appliance for insertion into human organs to be used in accordance
with the method of the invention is characterized by that a pair of foldable,
elastic end wire rings are provided at the opposite ends of a tube
made of cloth or a sheet of flexible
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of collapsing a collapsible tubular appliance
made of cloth or the like flexible material and provided

with a pair of resiliently foldable opposite end rings (10)
for the subsequent implantation in a human organ by using a collapsing

device comprising a funneled tube (18) before inserting it
into a catheter, comprising the following steps:


inserting the tubular appliance into said collapsing
device while folding the rings (10) in such a manner that

the rings take a wavy form, with the opposite two of four
points quadrisecting the circumference of each of the rings

being positioned in the catheter forwardly to form
forwardly directed peaks, and the other opposite two of

said four points being positioned rearwardly to form the
bottoms of forwardly directed valleys;
pulling the forwardly positioned front ring (10) at the
two points which form the peaks to move the tubular

appliance through the collapsing device.
