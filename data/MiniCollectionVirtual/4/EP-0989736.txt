<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image exposure device using
a laser; more specifically the present invention is related to
controlling the driving current applied to the laser.In a conventional image exposure device, as used e.g. in an
electrophotographic printer or in an imagesetter, an image is formed
on a radiation-sensitive body by exposing the body image-wise by a
laser beam from a laser. In a conventional electrophotographic
printer, the image on the radiation-sensitive body is a latent
image, which is developed into a visible toner image, that is
subsequently transferred to an image carrier such as a sheet of
paper. In a conventional imagesetter, the radiation-sensitive body
usually is the image carrier itself, such as a roll of photographic
film; on the film, a latent image is exposed, that is afterwards
developed in a processor into a visible image.The laser in the image exposure device may be a semiconductor
laser; the laser beam is modulated based on an image signal that
corresponds to the image.A semiconductor laser has a threshold current level Ith
(expressed e.g. in mA). A laser beam is emitted if the electrical
driving current I applied to the laser is larger than the threshold
current level Ith. Fig. 1a shows two curves, one for a low
temperature and one for a high temperature, with corresponding
threshold current levels IthLOW and IthHIGH; the temperature dependence
of Ith is discussed below. Below the threshold current level Ith, the
radiation intensity RI (expressed e.g. in mW) of the radiation
emitted by the laser is very small, and in fact, the emitted
radiation is not coherent, i.e. it is not really laser radiation.
Thus, in general only the portions of the curves for I larger than
Ith are useful for imaging purposes; therefore the portions of the
curves in Fig. 1a for I smaller than Ith are drawn as dashed lines. 
The driving current I that is applied to the laser is modulated
based on the image signal, so that the intensity RI of the emitted
laser beam is a function of the image signal.The laser threshold current level Ith is not constant, but
depends on different factors, such as the ambient temperature, the
ageing of the laser, differences between individual lasers.
Fluctuations in the threshold current level cause significant
variations of the laser beam intensity; as shown in Fig. 1a, the
threshold current level changes from IthLOW to IthHIGH when temperature
changes from low to high.In order to obtain good image quality, the intensity RI of the
laser beam should depend
