<DESCRIPTION>
 Topi cal compositions containi ng steroids.This invention relates to a novel composition comprising a 16,16-disubstituted androstene steroid compound, specifically adapted for topical application.United Kingdom Patent, GB 1 538 227 (BEECHAM), discloses a group of 16,16-disubstituted androstene steroid compounds having pharmaceutical activity, which particular compounds are described as having utility in the treatment of androgen dependent skin disorders such as acne and seborrhoea. The possible use of these compounds in the treatment of androgenic alopecia and male pattern baldness in women is proposed, but not substantiated.GB 1 538 227 describes compounds of formula (I):(I)whereinRj is a C*ι_5 alkyl group, a C~\.Q alkenyl group, a Cβ.g cycloalkyl group, or a phenylalkyl group in which the alkyl moiety contains 1 to 3 carbon atoms and the phenyl moiety is optionally substituted; R2 is a hydroxyl group, or a group OR4 wherein R4 is a C2-7 alkanoyl group, a CJL_4 alkyl group, or an optionally substituted benzyl group; and R3 is hydrogen or a Cι_5 alkyl group; or 2 and R3 together with the carbon atom to which they are joined represent a carbonyl group.Optional substituents for phenyl moieties include Cι_4 alkyl, halogen and nitro.Preferably i is a methyl, ethyl or n- or i§o-propyl group, and most preferably a methyl group. 

Preferably 2 is a hydroxyl group. Variable R2 suitably has the β-configuration.Preferably R3 is hydrogen or methyl, and most preferably hydrogen.Particularly favoured is the compound of formula (I) in which ^ is methyl; R2 is hydroxy and has the β-configuration; and R3 is hydrogen, which is the compound androst-4-ene-16,16-dimethyl-17β-ol-3-one.GB 1538 227 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I) together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, for topical or oral administration.GB 1538 227 describes a preferred composition for topical administration to the skin as comprising a compound of formula (I) which has been formulated as a cream or ointment using conventional formulations well known in the art, for example as described in standard text books of pharmaceutics and cosmetics, such as Harry's Cosmeticology and the British Pharmacopoeia-Compounds of formula (I) and in particular the compound androst-4-ene-16,16-dimethyl-17β-ol-3-one are claimed to have 5α-reductase inhibitory activity but no significant androgenic, anti-androgenic or anabolic activity. The lack of systemic side-effects is considered to render these compounds, and especially

Claims
1. A topically administrable composition comprising a compound of formula I as hereindefined and a topically acceptable carrier which includes a volatile solvent and a non- volatile solvent wherein the composition is specifically adapted to present a compound of formula I to a site of action on the skin or scalp in a substantially saturated or supersaturated concentration such that penetration of the skin or scalp is promoted, characterised in that the non-volatile solvent is isopropyl isosterate or a mixture of non-volatile solvents including isopropyl isosterate.
2. A composition as claimed in claim 1 additionally comprising an antinucleating agent.
3. A composition as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the composition is at least 5 x supersaturated.
4. A composition as claimed herein wherein the volatile solvent is present in the range 80 - 99% w/v.
5. A composition as claimed herein wherein the compound of formula I comprises 0.005 to 5% w/v.
6. A composition as claimed herein wherein the compound of formula 1 is androst-4-ene-16, 16 dimethyl-17β-ol-3-one.
