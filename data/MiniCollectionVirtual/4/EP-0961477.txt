<ABSTRACT>
Film scanning apparatus having a film cartridge chamber 16 for
receiving a film cartridge containing photographic film having images to be

scanned, a film takeup chamber 36 and a film scan gate 84 therebetween. The
apparatus has an upstream nip roller set 102 positioned between the film cartridge

chamber 16 and the film scan gate 84 and includes at least one drive roller and
pinch roller set 114a,b in which the drive roller has a compliant film engagement

surface. A downstream nip roller set 104 is positioned between the film scan gate
84 and the film takeup chamber 36 and includes at least one drive roller and pinch

roller set 114a,b in which the drive roller has a compliant film engagement
surface. The upstream nip roller set 102 exerts constant tensioning force on film

148 in the film scan gate 84 buffering the film in the film scan gate 84 against
variable tensioning effects on the film 148 caused by the film cartridge. A drive

motor is directly connected to the downstream drive roller set 120a,b and the
downstream roller set is drivingly connected to the upstream drive roller set

106a,b by an elastic drive belt 135. A differential compression force is exerted on
the pinch rollers 114a,b such that the force on the downstream pinch rollers is

greater than on the upstream pinch rollers thereby causing a film speed differential
between the upstream and downstream roller sets that maintains a desired degree

of tension on film transported through the film scan gate 84.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of photographic
media image scanners. More specifically, the invention relates to small, low cost
scanners adapted for use with personal computers by consumers who wish to
generate digital images from processed film stored in a film cartridge as in the
case of the Advanced Photo System (APS) film.A film scanner that passes film across a linear scanning gate must
maintain the film absolutely in a flat plane along the length of the scanning
aperture and must also advance the film trough the scanning zone at a constant
scan pitch in order to achieve proper scanning of the image on the film. It is
known to provide an arced film scanning surface so that the scan direction of the
film lies in a flat plane as the film passes over the scanning aperture. This
procedure requires that the film be held in slight tension as it passes over the
scanning aperture. Additionally, the rate of advance of the film across the scan
gate must be held constant in order that the resultant lines of image scan be
uniformly spaced in the direction of film motion across the scanning aperture.
This tensioning and uniform rate of film drive can be achieved without great
difficulty using a stepper motor to drive a single nip roller set downstream to pull
the film from the film supply reel. In a scanner designed to pull film from an
Advanced Photo System film storage cartridge, it has been found that the normal
retention force of the film spool is somewhat irregular which adversely affects the
uniformity of the film feed rate across the scanning aperture. For this reason, it is
desirable to utilize a mechanism, such as an upstream nip roller set, to isolate the
film drive from the irregular retention forces of the film cartridge. The
introduction of an upstream nip roller set, however, introduces additional
problems in holding the film feed rate constant across the scanning aperture.US-A-5,261,754 discloses a paper feeding device for a printer that
utilizes a timing belt, that is, impliedly an inelastic belt, to drive upstream and
downstream nip roller sets at the same angular velocity and avoids irregular paper
feed across a linear print head by tensioning the paper between the upstream and
downstream roller sets. The tensioning is accomplished according to the 
explanation in the patent by employing metal, that is, non-compliant, drive rollers
and compliant pinch rollers and by applying a higher degree of pressure on the
downstream pinch rollers than on the upstream pinch rollers.

Film drive apparatus comprising:

an upstream nip roller set 102 including at least one drive roller and
pinch roller set 123a,b in which the drive roller has a compliant film engagement

surface;
a downstream nip roller set 104 including at least one drive roller
and pinch roller set 123a,b in which the drive roller has a compliant film

engagement surface;
a drive motor directly engaged with the downstream drive roller set
120a,b;
an elastic drive belt 135 drivingly engaging the downstream drive
roller set 120a,b to the upstream drive roller set 106a,b; and
means for exerting a differential compression force on the pinch
rollers 123a,b against their respective drive rollers, the compression force on the

downstream nip roller set 104 being higher than on the upstream nip roller set 102;
so that a self-regulating speed differential of the downstream nip
roller set 104 to the upstream nip roller set 102 is maintained greater than one.
Film scanning apparatus of the type having a film cartridge
chamber for receiving a film cartridge containing photographic film having images

to be scanned, a film takeup chamber and a film scan gate therebetween; the
apparatus comprising:


an upstream nip roller set including at least one drive roller and
pinch roller set in which the drive roller has a compliant film engagement surface

and is positioned between the film cartridge chamber and the film scan gate;
a downstream nip roller set including at least one drive roller and
pinch roller set in which the drive roller has a compliant film engagement surface

and is positioned between the film scan gate and the film takeup chamber;
so that the upstream nip roller set exerts constant tensioning force
on film in the film scan gate buffering the film in the film scan gate against

variable tensioning effects on the film caused by the film cartridge.
The film scanning apparatus of claim 2 wherein the film
takeup chamber exerts an increasing resistive force on the film exiting the

downstream nip roller set with increasing diameters of film wound into the takeup
chamber, the apparatus including an elastic drive belt drivingly engaging the

downstream nip roller set to the upstream nip roller set, so that the elastic belt
compensates for reductions in speed differential of the downstream nip roller set

to the upstream nip roller set caused by the increasing resistive force on the film
exiting the downstream nip roller set.
The film scanning apparatus of claim 2 wherein the
apparatus includes a plurality of edge guide pins adjacent the film scan gate; and

the downstream nip roller set includes a conical shaped pinch roller having a
compliant film engaging surface; the conical pinch roller effectively urging an

adjacent edge of the film against the edge guide pins.
The film scanning apparatus of claim 4 wherein the
apparatus includes magnetic read and/or write heads located at a predetermined

relative position to the film edge guide pins and the conical pinch roller urging the
film against the edge pins to maintain data tracks on the film in alignment with the

magnetic read and/or write heads.
The film scanning apparatus of claim 2 wherein the
apparatus includes a plurality of edge guide pins adjacent the film scan gate; and

the upstream and downstream nip roller sets each include a pair of drive roller and
pinch rollers adjacent opposite edges of film transported through the scan gate; the

drive rollers nearest the edge guide pins having a larger diameter than drive rollers
remote from the edge guide pins; so that the film is urged against the edge guide

pins during transport of film through the film scan gate.
The film scanning apparatus of claim 2 wherein the
apparatus includes a drive motor directly engaged with the downstream drive

roller set;

an elastic drive belt drivingly engaging the downstream drive roller
set to the upstream drive roller set; and
means for exerting a differential compression force on the pinch
rollers against their respective drive rollers, the compression force on the

downstream nip roller set being higher than on the upstream nip roller set.
The film scanning apparatus of claim 7 wherein the
upstream and downstream nip roller sets include shafts on which the pinch rollers

are placed in freely rotatable manner; the means for differential compression force
comprises a pair of compression clamps engaging the pinch roller shafts and a pair

of tension springs engaging the compression clamps offset closer to the
downstream pinch rollers than the upstream pinch rollers to apply a relatively

higher compression force on the downstream pinch rollers than the upstream pinch

rollers.
