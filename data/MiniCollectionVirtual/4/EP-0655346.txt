<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides an ink jet recording sheet having a high ink absorptivity, capable of providing an 
image of a high density and a good sharpness and recorded dots of a substantially perfect circularity, and having a 

high water-resistance. A component of an ink receiving layer of this sheet consists mainly of non-spherical cationic 
colloidal silica, and this ink receiving layer is composed of a layer of coating formed by contour painting a surface of 

a substrate, in which sheet a total quantity of charge of cations is specified, a polyvinyl amine copolymer-containing 
substrate being used. Preferably, the non-spherical cationic colloidal silica consists of acicular or columnar cationic 

colloidal silica.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording sheet and more particularly to an ink jet
recording sheet of slight-coat type which shows no
uneven spread of ink, is excellent in ink absorption, is
high in density and sharpness of recorded images, can
provide a recorded dot close to a true circle and
besides, is excellent in water resistance of recorded
dots.The ink jet recording method performs
recording of letters or images by allowing ink droplets
ejected by various working principles to deposit on a
recording sheet such as paper. The ink jet recording
has such favorable features that it makes high-speed
recording possible, that it produces little noise, that
it can easily perform multi-color recording, that there
is no limitation as to kind of patterns, and that it
requires no developing-fixing. Thus, the ink jet
recording is rapidly becoming widespread as devices for
recording various characters including kanji and color
images. Furthermore, the images formed by the multi-color
ink jet recording method are by no means inferior 
to those printed by a multi-color press of those
obtained by a color-photography. Besides, use of the
ink jet recording extends to a field of full-color image
recording where number of copies is not so many, since
costs per copy are less than those employing the
photographic process.As for the recording sheets used for ink jet
recording, efforts have been made from the aspects of
printer hardwares or ink composition in order to use
woodfree papers or coated papers used for ordinary
printing or writing. However, improvements in recording
sheets have come to be required increasingly in order to
go side by side with developments in printer hardwares
such as ever increasing speed, development of ever finer
definition and images of full color.That is, for recording sheets, it is required
that image density of the printed ink dots be high and
hue characteristics be bright and appealing, and the ink
absorbing speed be high and as a result, the ink applied
do not bleed or spread even though the recorded dots are
put over additionally. Moreover, the diffusion of the
recorded dot in the transverse direction should not be
greater than needed and the circumference of dots should
be sharp and demarcating.The ink jet recording sheets as to their form
can be roughly classified into those of plain paper type
represented by so-called fine papersÂ·bond papers and
those of coated type which comprise a support such as 
paper, for example, fine paper, synthetic paper or
synthetic resin film
