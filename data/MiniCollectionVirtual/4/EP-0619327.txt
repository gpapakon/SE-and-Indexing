<ABSTRACT>
In an improved process for producing elastomeric 
ethylene-propylene copolymers with a propylene content 

comprised within the range of from 22 to 38 % by 
weight and a content of residual chlorine, coming from 

the co-catalyst, lower than 300 parts per million 
parts, the polymerization is carried out in suspension 

in the monomers in the liquid state, with vanadium 
triacetylacetonate and alkyl-Al compounds, and the 

obtained polymer is recovered without any washing 
steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing ethylene-propylene copolymers (EPM) with low 
level of propylene and containing very reduced amounts 
of chlorine derived from the catalyst. The present invention relates as well to the 
copolymers manufactured by means of said process and 
to the manufactured articles fabricated from them. The mechanical properties of ethylene copolymers 
with alpha-olefins are known to depend on the nature 
of the olefin and on the used polymerization process 
(see, e.g., "Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and 
Technology", Vol. 6, pages 354-357). From the prior art, also ethylene-propylene 
elastomers are known as well, which are manufactured 
on the large industrial scale by means of solution or 
suspension processes by means of Ziegler-Natta 
catalysts. Such catalysts are generally constituted by 
at least two components: 
(a) a salt of a transition metal belonging to one of 
the Periodical System groups from IV to VIII,  (b) a metal-organic compound of a metal belonging to 
a group from groups I and IV of the Periodical 
System.   In order to obtain copolymers characterized by 
low crystallinity, narrow distribution of molecular 
weights and constant composition, as the salt of the 
transition metal, a vanadium compound is preferred; in 
this case, the complete catalytic system comprises a  
 
third component (c) capable of increasing the 
polymerization productivity, expressed as kg of 
polyers produced per g of vanadium per hour (kg 
pol./gv*h). Particularly used components of (a) type are 
vanadium salts with valency of from three to five, 
such as, e.g., vanadium halides, vanadium oxyhalides, 
vanadium alkoxides or vanadyl alkoxides and vanadium 
acetylacetonate. Preferred components of (b) type are metal-organic 
compounds of aluminum, such as, e.g., 
trialkyl-aluminum compounds and alkyl-aluminum 
halides. The components of (c) type generally are 
halogenated organic compounds, such as chloroalkanes 
or chloroesters, such as, e.g., CHCl3, CCl4, ethyl 
trichloroacetate or n-butyl perchlorocrotonate. According to as disclosed in U.S. 4,540,753 at 
column 14, lines from 50 to 58, in order that the 
catalytic system may be active in ethylene and 
propylene copolymerization, it is necessary that at 
least one of both components (a) or (b) contains 
halogens. For the polymerization processes carried out in 
suspension in liquid hydrocarbons, with operating 
temperatures not higher than 50°C, a particularly 
advantageous catalytic system is constituted by
