A blood collection assembly includes a container, optionally covered 
by a puncturable septum and evacuated. A clotting enhancer in the 

container activates both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways. 
The invention includes a method to make the clotting enhancer.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field of the Invention. This invention relates to blood collection
and more particularly relates to an additive for a collection tube which
enhances clotting.2. Background. Blood samples are routinely taken in evacuated
tubes, such as glass VACUTAINER™ tubes (Becton, Dickinson and
Company). One end of a double-ended needle is inserted into a patient's
vein. The other end of the needle then punctures a septum covering the
open end of the VACUTAINER™ tube so that the vacuum in the tube draws
the blood sample through the needle into the tube. Using this technique, a
plurality of samples can be taken using a single needle puncture of the
skin. Plastic tubes have also been proposed for blood collection. Plastic
offers a number of advantages such as lower breakage than glass tubes,
less weight in shipment, and easier disposal by incineration.Blood collected in evacuated tubes often must be clotted prior to
clinical examination. It is desirable to form a dense clot as rapidly and
completely as possible to facilitate clean separation of the clot from the
serum layer by centrifugation. To achieve this end, both plastic and glass
blood collection tubes frequently employ a clot activator.Two types of activators, classified in the art according to the portion 
of the blood coagulation cascade stimulated, are conventionally employed.
Particulate activators share a common biochemical mechanism of clot
activation known as contact activation of the intrinsic pathway. Whole
blood contains all of the necessary factors to cause clotting by the intrinsic
pathway. Clot activation by the intrinsic pathway is surface area
dependent, i.e., the time required to form a complete blood clot is
dependent on the total number of activating surface sites per unit-area on
the activator surface relative to the volume of blood. Greater surface area,
provided by finely divided particulate activators, leads to shorter clot times.
Particulate activators are used in practically all commercial blood collection
tubes and lead to dense, crosslinked clots that cleanly separate from the
serum in a hematological centrifuge. Clot formation, however, is relatively
slow, and about 30-60 minutes are required prior to centrifugation. Typical
particulate activators used commercially are silica impregnated in fabric,
silica particles in small plastic cups or silicate particles applied to the tube
wall in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). When blood enters a tube containing
silicate-PVP, the PVP dissolves, enters the serum and the silicate particles
are

<CLAIMS>
A coagulation enhancing additive for a blood collection container comprising a
particle having a plurality of surface areas, a first of said surface areas activating the

intrinsic coagulation pathway and a second of said surface areas having immobilized
thereon an activator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway.
The additive of claim 1 further comprising a layer of plastic between said
second surface and said immobilized activator.
A blood collection assembly comprising:

a) a blood collection container having an open end;
b) a septum over said open end, said container being evacuated; and
c) the additive of Claim 1 within said evacuated container.
A method for preparing an additive for a blood collection tube which activates
both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways comprising:


a) coating the outside surface of a hollow glass microsphere with plastic;
b) immobilizing an activator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway on said coating
to give a microsphere having a surface which activates the extrinsic coagulation

pathway; and
c) crushing said microsphere having immobilized thereon an activator of the
extrinsic pathway to expose the native glass inside surface of the microsphere.
