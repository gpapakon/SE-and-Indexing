<ABSTRACT>
A process for decreasing the build-up of inorganic incrustations 

on textiles deriving from water hardness and due to repeated 
washing cycles with detergent compositions comprises the 

addition to the washing bath of a non-reducing carbohydrate 
and/or non-reducing carbohydrate derivative as co-builder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for decreasing 
the build-up of inorganic incrustations on fabrics deriving 
from water hardness and due to repeated washing cycles with 
detergent compositions. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
process for decreasing the build-up of inorganic incrustations 
wherein a co-builder is added to the washing cycle, and to 
detergent and/or antiincrustating composition containing said 
co-builder. It is well known that detergents contain builders in order 
to support detergent action and to eliminate calcium and 
magnesium ions (hardness ions), which arise partly from the 
water and sometimes also from soil and fabrics. In case of multiple washing cycles the washing performance 
significantly reduces because of the build up of 
inorganic incrustations on fabrics and on washing machine 
components. Such build up of inorganic incrustations on 
fabrics decreases the flexibility of fibres and consequently 
shorten the fabric life, in addition to greying the tissue. A well known builder is the sodium tripolyphosphate 
which has excellent properties in the washing process even at 
low concentrations. Despite its many advantageous properties, 
it causes serious ecological problems, namely eutrophication 
of standing or slowly flowing surface waters leading to 
extreme algal growth which adversely influences marine organisms.  
 
Therefore, the use of phosphate free detergents is of 
great importance. Some substitutes of phosphate builders such as zeolites 
have been adopted. However, zeolites alone in water softening 
have poor efficiency. Therefore, good antiincrustating effects 
are achieved only in the presence of auxiliary compounds 
called co-builders. The most widely used co-builders are synthetic polymers 
and/or co-polymers of olefinic mono-or dicarboxylic acids such 
as acrylic and maleic acid and copolymers of said monomers 
with other allylic or vinylic monomers. The common characteristic 
of these polymeric materials is their minimal 
biodegradability which leads to ecological problems. There are known other non-polymeric co-builders, such as 
EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid sodium salt), NTA 
(nitrilotriacetic acid sodium salt) and phosphonates. Like the 
polymeric co-builders these substances too are non-biodegradable. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a process for decreasing the build-up of inorganic 
incrustations on fabrics and on washing machine components by 
using co-builders which are very
