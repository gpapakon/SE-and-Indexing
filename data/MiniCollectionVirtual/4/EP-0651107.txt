<ABSTRACT>
A cooling ceiling for room air conditioning exhibits a pipe system which has cooling water flowing through it, which is provided, at least in certain areas, between the ceiling (1) of the building and ceiling elements (3) arranged at a distance beneath said ceiling, and which is fixed in the installation position via a retaining member (5) which bears the ceiling elements (3). In this arrangement, those regions of the cooling pipe (4) of the pipe system which are located opposite a ceiling element (3) rest on the ceiling element (3), and provided between the retaining member (5) and that region of the cooling pipe (4) which is assigned to said retaining member in each case is a vertically movable connection member (10) which has the cooling pipe (4) latched in it in a shaped hollow (9). The connection member (10) is designed as a retaining bracket (11, 11') which freely engages over the retaining member (5) and at the respective end regions (12, 13) of which at least one cooling pipe (4) may be latched.

A cooling ceiling for air conditioning a room with a system of pipes through which
cooling water flows, the pipe system being provided at least in regions between the

ceiling (1) of a building and ceiling elements (3) spaced below the ceiling and being
fixed in the installed position by means of a holding element (5) supporting the ceiling

elements (3), the portions of a cooling pipe (4) of the pipe system opposite a ceiling
element (3) lying against said ceiling element (3) when in the installed position, a

vertically movable connecting element (10), receiving the cooling pipe (4) snap-locked
in a shaped recess (9), being provided between the holding element (5) and the respective

portion of the cooling pipe (4) associated therewith, characterized in that said
connecting element (10) is formed as a holding bracket (11, 11') freely/contactlessly

embracing said holding element (10) and that at least one cooling pipe (4) may be fixed
to the respective end portions (12, 13) of the connecting element by said snap-lock.
The cooling ceiling of claim 1, characterized in that said holding bracket (11, 11') is
U-shaped and that the ends of two parallel holding legs (17, 18) extending from the

base bar (16) of said holding bracket receive said cooling pipe (4) in a respective
receiving element (20) provided with said shaped recess (9).
The cooling ceiling of claim 2, characterized in that said holding legs (17, 18) and
said receiving element (20) are adapted to be connected by plug-in connecting means

(21, 22).
The cooling ceiling of claim 2 or 3, characterized in that said receiving element (20)
has a plurality of shaped recesses (9) connected by a transversal bar (23) provided with

said plug-in connecting means (22). 
The cooling ceiling of one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that said holding brackets
(11, 11') are each provided with at least one shaped stud (25), by which respective

adjacent holding brackets (11) may be supported at each other through a connecting bar
(27) having a corresponding complementary shape (26).
The cooling ceiling of claim 5, characterized in that said U-shaped holding brackets
(11, 11') are provided with said shaped studs (25) in the region of said base bar (16)

and/or in the region of said holding legs (17, 18).
The cooling ceiling of one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that, through said plug-in
connecting means (21, 22). said holding legs (17, 18) have their respective ends

connected to an intermediate support (30) having receiving openings (31) from which
is suspended a shaped part (32) receiving the pipes (4) in its shaped recess (9').
The cooling ceiling of claim 7, characterized in that said shaped part (32) has a
parallelepiped basic shape and is connected to said intermediate support (30) by means

of respective hook portions (33).
The cooling ceiling of one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that said holding bracket
(11') is formed as a telescopic element (38) at least in portions thereof.
The cooling ceiling of claim 9, characterized in that said holding bracket (11') is

formed as a telescopic element (38) in the region of the base bar (16) and the holding
legs (17, 18), respectively.
The cooling ceiling of claim 9 or 10, characterized in that the telescope portions
(39, 40) of the telescopic member may be pushed in or pulled out gradually. 
The cooling ceiling of one of claims 9 to 11, characterized in that the telescope
portions (39, 40) of the telescopic member are provided with a toothed bar (42)

defining their draw-out length and cooperating with a catch member.
The cooling ceiling of one of claims 1 to 12, characterized in that said holding
bracket (11, 11') has a vertical support (43) adapted to be placed on said holding

element (5) when in the installed position.
