<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITIONS USEFUL IN DIAGNOSIS AND PROPHYLAXIS OF LYME DISEASECross-Reference to Related Application This is a continuation-in-part of pending U. S.Patent Application SN 944,464, filed September 14, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of U. S. Patent Application SN 07/889,015, filed May 26, 1992.Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to the field of pharmaceutical and diagnostic compositions useful in the diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis of Lyme borreliosis. More specifically, the invention provides isolated natural and recombinant proteins, polypeptides and macromolecular antigens that are derived from Borrelia burgdorferi and differentiated in the tick vector.Background of the InventionThe causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, i.e., Lyme disease, the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted by the bite of various species of Ixodes ticks carrying the spirochete. The reservoir of the infection is most likely the white footed mouse, Peromyεcus leucopus, and the disease can be transmitted to many mammalian species including dogs, cats, and man [J. G. Donahue, et al.. Am. "J. TrOP. Med. Hvα.. 3j6:92-96 (1987); R. T. Green, et al.. J. Clin. Micro.. 26:648-653 (1988)]. The B . burgdorferi strain B31 is believed to be responsible for about 90% of the known isolates of Borrelosis in the United States. The diagnosis of Lyme disease in humans and animals has been compromised by the 

lack of definitive serology leading to rapid and accurate testing and the lack of suitable bacterial antigens capable of eliciting an immune response in vaccinates. Cultured preparations of Borrelia burgdorferi have been used to generate whole cell sonicate for ELISA and western blot analysis, which has yielded only marginal results [M. Karlsson et al.. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Pis.. 8.:871-877 (1990), S. W. Luger et al. , Arch. Intern. Med.. .15:761-763 (1990), I. Olsson et al.. Acta. Derm. Venereol. tStockh . ) . 71:127-133 (1991)]. A number of bacterial antigens have been identified that may be more useful in serodiagnosis, including outer surface proteins A and B (OspA and OspB) , flagellin, and other proteins designated P21, P39, P66, and P83 according to their estimated molecular weights [A. G.Barbour et al.. Infect. Immun. , ,4_5:94-100 (1984); . J. Simpson et al.. J. Clin. Microbiol.. 2J3:1329-1337 (1990); K. Hansen et al.. Infect. Immun. , J56_:2047-2053 (1988); K. Hansen et al. , Infect. J. Clin. Microbiol., 26:338-346 (1988) ; B. ilske et al. , Zentral, Bakteriol.Parasitenkd.
