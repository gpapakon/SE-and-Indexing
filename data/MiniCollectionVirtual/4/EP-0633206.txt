<ABSTRACT>
A shroud (10) to contain contaminants removed from 
a conveyor chain (15) during cleaning with pressurized 

air is substantially enclosed except for chain ingress 
and egress openings (45) and a contaminant discharge 

opening (42). The shroud includes a top (12) hinged to 
a bottom (14). The top supports air nozzles (22) and the 

bottom defines the discharge opening (42).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to equipment for
lubricating and cleaning chain conveyors and more
particularly to such equipment using compressed air.Chain conveyors commonly are used in a wide variety
of industries, such as paint lines, bottling/canning
lines, and can manufacturing. To increase the life of a
chain conveyor, it is necessary to intermittently
lubricate and to clean the chain. Unfortunately, any
excess lubricant will collect on the chain. The excess
lubricant slings off during travel, contaminating the
conveyed articles and/or their contents. In addition,
dirt will collect on the chain conveyor, bonding with the
excess lubricant.US-A-3486581 discloses a spray oiler with a U-shaped
housing including oilers for oiling the support wheels of
meat hooks with mineral oil as they pass along a rail
into and out of a meat curing room. Spaced on either
side of the rail are two troughs for catching the oil.
The troughs have drain plugs. DE-A-2265037 discloses an apparatus
for lubricating having a
housing with spray nozzles. Lubricant is sprayed out of
the nozzles assisted by compressed air pulses. A chain
passes through the housing which therefore has an
aperture at each end thereof.It is known in the art to use pressurized air to
blow excess lubricant and contaminants off the chain of 
the conveyor. An example of this technique is
illustrated in US-A-4 630 712 and this discloses the
features of the pre-characterising portion of claim 1.
The chain conveyor, on a large sprocket, passes one air
nozzle, then lubricant nozzles, followed by another air
nozzle. However the pressurized air blows the oil and
contaminants in all directions, thus creating a mess and
it is an object of the invention to avoid this problem.According to the present invention there is provided
an apparatus for lubricating and cleaning a chain
conveyor having the features set out in claim 1. Various
preferred features are recited in the dependent claims. In a preferred embodiment, the shroud comprises a
bottom and a top hingedly mounted on the bottom.
In addition, a gap can be provided between the top
and bottom to permit spindles attached to the chain
conveyor to pass through the shroud. The apertures can be
dimensioned to accommodate closely the chain conveyor, in
order to reduce the likelihood of any contaminants
escaping the chamber through these openings.In operation of the apparatus, the chain
conveyor passes through the chamber. The pressurized air
from the air nozzles disposed in the top cover blows
excess lubricants and

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for lubricating and cleaning a chain
conveyor comprising: a lubricant applicator (48) for

applying lubricant to a chain conveyor; and an air-blowing
nozzle (22),

downstream of the applicator (48),
which, in use, blows air to blow

excess lubricants and other contaminants off the chain
conveyor, thereby reducing the amount of lubricant and

contaminants on the chain conveyor; characterised by a
conveyor chain cleaning shroud (10) for covering the

chain conveyor while the chain conveyor is cleaned, the
shroud comprising a chamber (20) formed by a bottom (14)

and a top (12) mounted on the bottom; the top and bottom
together having two opposite ends and defining an end

wall (18) at each of said ends, each end wall (18) defining an
aperture (45) for allowing a chain conveyor to pass

through the shroud (10) along a chain path between the
apertures (45), the bottom (14) having a vent for draining residue

from the shroud (10), the air-blowing nozzle (22) being
mounted in at least one of the top (12) and bottom (14) and being

directed on to the chain path inside the chamber (20); the
lubricant applicator (48) being located outside the

chamber (20) for applying lubricant to the chain conveyor
outside the chamber (20).
An apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said top
(12) and said bottom (14) each have a hinge side and a 

free side, said top (12) being hinged to said bottom (14) on said
hinge side.
An apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein
at least one of said top (12) and said bottom (14)

defines a hole for receiving the air nozzle (22) for
blowing air onto the chain conveyor to clean the chain

conveyor.
An apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 3
wherein said end walls (18) include removable bottom end

portions.
An apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 4
wherein said end walls (18) include removable top end

portions.
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3
in which the end walls (18) include rubber end portions.
An apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims in which the top and bottom include top (27) and

bottom (41) rails, respectively, the rails being spaced
apart by a gap (60) which is adapted to permit spindles

(58) attached to the chain conveyor to pass through the
shroud. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 8 which includes
adjustment screws (62) for adjusting the gap (60); and

preferably in which the rails (27,41) have curved ends
(64,66) for guiding spindles (58) into the gap (60).
An apparatus according to any preceding claim which
includes a plurality of said air-blowing nozzles mounted

within said top (12).
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in
which the chain path is linear.
