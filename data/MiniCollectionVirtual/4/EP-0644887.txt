<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of clavulanic acid or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters in which an amine of formula (II) is used as an intermediate to form a salt with clavulanic acid, R1, R2 and R3 being selected from various substituent atoms and groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of clavulanic acid 
(I): 
 
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof. Clavulanic acid is normally prepared by the fermentation of a microorganism 
which produces clavulanic acid, such as various microorganisms belonging to 
various Streptomyces strains such as S. clavuligerus NRRL 3585, S. jumoninensis 
NRRL 5741, S. katsurahamanus IFO 13716 and Streptomyces sp. P 6621 FERM 
P2804 e.g. as described in JP Kokai 80-162993. The resulting aqueous broth may be 
subjected to conventional purification and concentration processes, for example 
involving filtration and chromatographic purification, such as disclosed in GB 
1508977 and JP Kokai 80-62993, before extraction of the aqueous solution with an 
organic solvent to yield a solution of crude clavulanic acid in the organic solvent. GB 1508977 discloses inter alia that salts of clavulanic acid can be obtained 
by absorbing the clavulanate anion in filtered broth on to an anion exchange resin, 
eluting therefrom with an electrolyte, desalting the resulting solution, applying the 
desalted solution to a further anion exchange resin, chromatographically eluting 
therefrom with an electrolyte, desalting the resulting solution and thereafter removing 
the solvent. This process can be used to give acceptable yields of pure material but 
the use of resin columns involves significant investment and they can introduce 
limitations in large scale production operations. It would therefore be desirable to 
have an alternative procedure available that involved few resin utilizing stages. GB 1543563 discloses a process for the preparation of clavulanic acid salts via 
precipitation of lithium clavulanate. GB 1578739 describes various amine salts of 
clavulanic acid as pharmaceutical compounds. EP 0026044 discloses the use of the 
tertiary-butylamine salt of clavulanic acid as a useful intermediate in the preparation 
of clavulanic acid. The salt has been disclosed in BE 862211, but only as a suitable 
ingredient for pharmaceutical formulations. PT.94.908 describes the use of tri-(lower 
alkyl)amine salts and the dimethylaniline salts of clavulanic acid in a purification 
process for clavulanic acid in which the triethylamine salt of clavulanic acid is formed 
and is then converted into a silyl diester of clavulanic acid. EP 0887178A discloses a  
 
process for the purification of clavulanic acid in which organic amines may be used to 
form an intermediate amine salt with clavulanic acid in an
