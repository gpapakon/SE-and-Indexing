<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for the production of isoflurane is disclosed. 
Isoflurane is formed by the exhaustive chlorination of 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl 

difluoromethyl ether with chlorine gas. The reaction mixture, 
preferably without purification or refining, is treated with UV light in 

the presence of isopropanol to reduce 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl 
difluoromethyl ether, the other major component thereof, to isoflurane. 

Isoflurane is thereby obtained in yields of at least 80%.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of inhalation anesthetics. 
In particular, this invention is directed to an improved method for 
preparing the inhalation anesthetic isoflurane which produces a 
significant increase in yield over present methods. Isoflurane, 1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether 
(CF₃-CHCl-O-CF₂H), has been the most widely used inhalation anesthetic 
over the past decade. Isoflurane, its preparation and use, are disclosed 
in Terrell U.S. Patent Nos. 3,535,388 and 3,535,425, both issued on 
October 20, 1970. GB-A-2 044 263 and FR-A-2 455 020 disclose syntheses of isoflurane. Paleta et al (1971) 
Coll. Czech. Chem. Commun. 36, 1867 discloses the preparation of halogenated alkanes.  
 A number of preparations of isoflurane have been published. In one 
synthesis, isoflurane is prepared by the chlorination of 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl-difluoromethyl 
ether (CF₃-CH₂-O-CF₂H). In order to prevent 
the level of the impurities CF₃-CCl₂-O-CF₂H, CF₃-CH₂-O-CF₂Cl 
and CF₃-CHCl-O-CF₂Cl in the reaction mixture from exceeding acceptable 
levels, i.e. about 10% by weight, the chlorination must be terminated when 
only about 60% of the starting material, CF₃-CH₂-O-CF₂H, has been 
consumed. Continued chlorination will produce excessive amounts of the 
by-product 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether, 
(CF₃-CCl₂-O-CF₂H).  
 In the above-described synthesis, after termination of chlorination, 
the reaction mixture comprising isoflurane, the starting material, and the 
above-mentioned impurities is subjected to fractional distillation. The 
starting material, CF₃-CH₂-O-CF₂H and CF₃-CH₂-O-CF₂Cl, recovered 
thereby, are recycled to the chlorination stage. Heretofore, CF₃-CCl₂-O-CF₂H recovered by the fractional distillation, 
has been reduced to form isoflurane by a method utilizing metallic 
zinc and aqueous acetic acid, which is expensive, both in terms of time 
and equipment. The zinc method has a further disadvantage in that it 
poses an environment disposal problem due to the formation of 
Zn(OCOCH₃)₂ and CH₃-O-CF₂-CHCl-O-CF₂H. In accordance with the present invention, the foregoing process is 
substantially improved in terms of efficiency, cost and environmental 
disposal problems. Isoflurane is prepared by exhaustive chlorination of 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl 
difluoromethyl ether followed by reduction of the unpurified 
reaction mixture by ultraviolet light in the presence of isopropanol 
Isoflurane may be recovered in yields greater than 80% by this 
process. The present
