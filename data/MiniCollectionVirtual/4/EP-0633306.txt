<ABSTRACT>
Polyunsaturated triglycerides are separated from an 
interesterification reaction product by sequential two stage chromatographic 

separations wherein triglycerides are separated from saturated fatty acids in 
the first stage and unsaturated fatty acids are recovered in the second stage 

for recycle to the interesterification reaction zone. In a preferred embodiment 
using silica gel in the first stage and silicalite in the second stage as 

adsorbents and heptanone as desorbent in both stages, triglyceride product 
is recovered as the first stage raffinate and the unsaturated fatty acid recycle 

product stream is recovered as the raffinate in the second stage. In another 
embodiment, using silicalite adsorbent in both stages and 2-heptanone in the 

first stage and acetone in the second stage as the desorbents, saturated fatty 
acids are removed as the ex
tract in the first stage and triglycerides and 
unsaturated fatty acids are separated in the second stage as raffinate product 

and extract product for recycle, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention belongs is the production of 
triglycerides having a high degree of unsaturation. More specifically, the 
invention relates to a process for reacting triglycerides with one or more 
unsaturated fatty acids via a catalyzed interesterification reaction followed by 
a two-stage adsorptive separation process for separating triglycerides from 
free fatty acids and unreacted unsaturated fatty acids with recycle of the 
unreacted material to the interesterification reaction zone. Interesterification reactions between triglycerides and free fatty 
acids have been used for upgrading triglyceride fats and oils, e.g., by 
increasing or decreasing the unsaturation of the fatty acid moieties in the 
triglyceride molecule. In US-A-4,275,081, it is disclosed that the reaction may 
be catalyzed by positionally selective water-soluble microbial lipase enzymes. 
Prior art catalysts based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals are also 
mentioned. It is disclosed that fatty acids liberated from the triglycerides 
participating in the reaction may be added to the free fatty acids contributing 
to the rearrangement of the fatty acid moieties on the triglycerides in the feed, 
but there is no disclosure of separating unreacted unsaturated fatty acids 
from the reaction effluent to return only the unsaturated free fatty acids to the 
reaction zone. US-A-3,328,439 discloses the use of chemical catalysts, e.g., 
natural and synthetic zeolitic aluminosilicates for the interesterification of 
glyceride oils. The separation of many classes of compounds by selective 
adsorption on molecular sieves or zeolites as well as other adsorbents is well 
known. Also, various separations based on the degree of unsaturation are 
known, e.g., esters of saturated fatty acids from unsaturated fatty acids with X 
or Y zeolites exchanged with a selected cation is taught in US-A-4,048,205. 
Similarly, monoethanoid fatty acids are separated from diethanoid fatty acids 
with cross-linked polystyrenes, e.g., "Amberlite" in US-A-4,353,838. A  
 
process for separating a mixture of triglycerides, based on the iodine values, 
is shown in US-A-4,277,412 and US-A-4,284,580 in which permutite and 
aluminated silica gel adsorbents, respectively, can be used. The use of silica gel in analytical chromatographic separations with 
various solvent systems is known. Particle sizes of silica gels used in 
analytical separations ranges from 3 to 10 microns. Also, the removal of 
various impurities from mixtures including

<CLAIMS>
A two-stage chromatographic separation process for 
recovering polyunsaturated triglycerides from an interesterification reaction 

zone comprising the steps of: reacting a mixture of a triglyceride oil or fat and 
an unsaturated fatty acid or mixture of unsaturated fatty acids with an 

interesterification catalyst in an interesterification reaction zone to increase the 
degree of unsaturation of said triglyceride oil or fat, contacting the resulting 

effluent from the interesterification zone in a first stage with a first adsorbent 
more selective for saturated fatty acids than for triglycerides, removing a first 

stage raffinate product stream comprising polyunsaturated triglycerides 
produced in said interesterification reaction zone from said first adsorbent, 

desorbing the saturated fatty acids produced in the interesterification reaction 
zone with a first desorbent to produce a first stage extract product stream 

containing the saturated fatty acids, contacting the product stream from said 
first stage containing unreacted unsaturated fatty acids with a second 

adsorbent in a second stage capable of separating said unsaturated fatty 
acids from said first stage product stream, recovering said unsaturated fatty 

acids from said second adsorbent, recycling said recovered unsaturated fatty 
acids to said interesterification reaction zone and recovering a raffinate 

product comprising polyunsaturated triglycerides either from the first stage 
raffinate stream or from a second stage product stream.

is selected from the group consisting of dealuminated Y zeolites, silicalite and 

silica gel. 
The process according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein said first 
desorbent is selected from the group consisting of ketones having from 3 to 8 

carbon atoms, ethers and esters. 
The process according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein said first 
desorbent is a ketone having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms. 
The process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4 wherein said 
first desorbent is heptanone, or 2-heptanone, or 3-heptanone. 
The process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5 wherein said 
second adsorbent is silicalite.

The process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6 wherein the 
first stage raffinate stream contains unsaturated fatty acids and 

polyunsaturated triglycerides and said raffinate product is recovered from the

adsorbent is desorbed with a second desorbent comprising a ketone having 

from 3 to 8 carbon atoms. 
The process according to Claim 9 wherein said second 
desorbent is 2-heptanone, or acetone.
