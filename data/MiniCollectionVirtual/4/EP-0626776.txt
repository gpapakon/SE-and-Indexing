<ABSTRACT>
A facility is provided which implements a "hold-for-pickup" function in 
the delivery of a data message, e.g., a facsimile. Particularly, the facility associates a 

data message that it receives from a sender with a respective confirmation number 
and sends the confirmation number to the sender. Thereafter, the facility transmits 

the message only to a receiver who enters the confirmation number when requested 
to do so. The facility also provides a number of other features, such as allowing the 

sender to specify the number of receivers that will receive the data message. 
Another feature associates a received data message with a plurality of confirmation 

numbers. In this way, a user may associate the confirmation numbers with 
respective receivers. The receivers may then obtain a copy of the sender's data 

message from the facility by entering their respective confirmation numbers when 
requested to do so.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to storing a user's data message in a telecommunications
network for delivery to an intended caller.In a facsimile store and forward system, a subscriber may place a call thereto
and enter the telephone number of a facsimile machine that is to receive a facsimile.
The subscriber may then transmit the facsimile to the system, which stores the
received facsimile in associated memory. Thereafter, the facsimile system places a
telephone call to the receiving facsimile machine and transmits the subscriber's
facsimile thereto. One aspect of such an arrangement is that the sender of a facsimile
has to know the telephone number of the receiving facsimile machine.
Disadvantageously, in certain situations it may be difficult to ascertain the telephone
number of a facsimile machine associated with an intended recipient. This is
especially true if the recipient happens to be travelling.US-A-5 168 371 discloses a picture image processing system that includes a
storage means, for temporarily storing and accumulating input data and job
parameters, and an enciphered identification key manual input means for entering a
user's enciphered identification key. The system permits input of an enciphered
identification key for a picture image data file, and subsequently permits the output of
a picture image data file with a enciphered identification key only after a subsequent
user has input the correct enciphered identification key. Job parameters for a stored
image, including the enciphered identification key code, are input into the system
together with the stored image."Globecom '92 Conference Record" Vol 2, 9 December 1992, pages 964-968,
Edward C Chung et al, Implementation of a Fax Distribution System in the Local
Area Networks of PCs, discloses a system having an on-demand fax documents
retrieval service. A user who gains access to the service selects a particular document
by a pre-set catalogue number. The fax server of the system searches a document
database using the selected catalogue number as a key. When the document is found,
the service faxes the document to the user. The present invention provides a method of providing a data message delivery
service in a telecommunications network characterised by the steps of:
responsive to receipt of a call from a user of the data message delivery service
desiring to send a data message to an intended recipient, generating a unique identifier
and supplying the identifier to the user, the identifier being other than an address of a
memory
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of providing a data message delivery service in a
telecommunication network CHARACTERISED BY the steps of


responsive to receipt of a call from a user of the data message delivery service
desiring to send a data message to an intended recipient, generating a unique identifier

by the data message delivery service
and supplying the identifier to the user, the identifier being other than an address of a

memory location,
responsive to receipt of the data message from the user, storing the data
message in memory in association with the unique identifier not then stored in

memory in association with any other stored message, and
responsive to receipt of the unique identifier from a subsequent caller,
unloading the data message and supplying it to the subsequent caller via the

telecommunications network.
The method of claim 1 wherein the unique identifier is a variable-length
sequence of digits, the length being based on the number of calls being processed by

the message delivery service within a predetermined period of time.
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the subsequent caller is one of a plurality
of subsequent callers each having access to the unique identifier, the method

FURTHER CHARACTERISED BY the steps of

prompting the user to enter the number of intended recipients of the data
message,
 
and
supplying the data message to only a like number of subsequent callers who
enter the unique identifier.
The method set forth in claim 1 or 2 wherein the subsequent caller is one of a
plurality of subsequent callers, the method FURTHER CHARACTERISED BY the

steps of

prompting the user to enter the number of intended recipients of the data
message,
responsive to the number of recipients of the data message entered by the user,
generating a plurality of unique identifiers, the plurality being equal to the number of

intended recipients, each identifier being other than an address of a memory location,
and
supplying the data message to respective ones of subsequent callers who enter
a respective one of the plurality of unique identifiers.
The method set forth in any preceding claim further CHARACTERISED BY
the step of responsive to supplying the data message to the subsequent caller(s),

placing a telephone call to the user and announcing that the data message has been
delivered to the subsequent caller(s). 
The method set forth in claim 5 wherein the step of announcing is further
CHARACTERISED BY the step of identifying the identifier associated with the

delivery data message.
The method set forth in any preceding claim FURTHER CHARACTERISED
BY the step of, responsive to a receipt of a subsequent call from the user and receipt

of the unique identifier(s), supplying to the user information indicative of whether the
associated data message has been supplied to the subsequent caller(s).
