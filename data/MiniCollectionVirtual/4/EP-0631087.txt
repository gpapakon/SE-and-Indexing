<ABSTRACT>
The suspension arm for control apparatuses or control panels is made up of a wall or top-attachment rotary articulation (1, 2) which can be secured on a vertical or a horizontal wall, of one or more carrying-arm portions, of an intermediate rotary articulation, of an angle (4) and of a coupling (5) which can be connected to the control apparatus or to the control panel, each carrying-arm portion being formed from a carrying tube (8, 9) which is of a polygonal or circular cross-section, is plugged with circumferential play, with its length ends, into plug-in receiving means (6, 7) of the wall or top-attachment rotary articulation (1, 2), of the intermediate rotary articulation, of the angle (4) and of the coupling (5), and is fixed therein. Each plug-in receiving means (6, 7) exhibits, on the inner side, at least one integrally formed protrusion (10, 11) in the form of bracing ribs or a tilting edge, with respect to which the plugged-in carrying tube (8, 9) is retained, by means of adjusting and clamping screws (12, 14), with horizontal and/or vertical alignment by way of pipe clamping (press-type bracing).

Mounted support for control units or control boards, 
comprising a wall-type or platform-type pivot joint (1, 2) 

adapted to be located on a vertical or horizontal wall, 
one or more carrier arm sections, an intermediate pivot 

joint (3), an angle (4) and a coupling (5) adapted to be 
connected to the control unit or control board, each 

carrier arm section being constituted by a carrier tube 
(8, 9) of angular or circular cross-section whose 

longitudinal ends are pushed with circumferential 

clearance into push-in locators (6, 7) on the wall-type or 
platform-type pivot joint (1, 2), on the intermediate 

pivot joint (4), on the angle (5) and on the coupling (6), 
and fixed in said locators (6, 7),
 
characterised in that internally each push-in locator (6, 

7) features at least one moulded projection (10, 11), in 
relation to which the pushed-in carrier tube (8, 9) is 

held horizontally and/or vertically aligned by means of 
locking and attachment screws (12, 14) so as to squeeze 

the tube and exert a clamping pressure on it. 
Mounted support according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the circular push-in locator (6) matching the 

cross-sectional shape of the pushed-in carrier tube (8) 
features two moulded projections (10) spaced at a 

circumferential angle apart from one another and that 
opposed to said projections (10) are arranged two locking 

and attachment screws (12) aligned radially to the push-in 
locator axis (EA), which retain the carrier tube (8) 

against the projections (10) by deforming the wall of the 
tube and keep it vertically or horizontally aligned by 

exerting pressure and squeezing on the tube. 
Mounted support according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the projections (10) in the push-in locator (6)  

 
are spaced at a circumferential angle of preferably 120° 

from one another. 
Mounted support according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the locking and attachment screws (12) are 

arranged with their tightening axes spaced at a 
circumferential angle of between 30° and 40° from one 

another and radially to the push-in locator axis (EA), and 
the locking and attachment screws (12) and the projections 

(10) are arranged symmetrically about a median line (M) 
which passes vertically through the push-in locator axis 

(EA). 
Mounted support according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the thickness (D) of the projections 

(10) is the same as a sub-portion of the thickness (W) of 
the wall of the carrier tube (8). 
Mounted support according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the projections (10) extend in a 

ribbed pattern with a segmental cross-section for the 
entire length of the push-in locator (6) and the locking 

and attachment screws (12) are situated in the end region 
of the push-in locator (6) that is nearest the push-in 

opening. 
Mounted support according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the push-in locators (7) have an angular, 

preferably rectangular or square cross-sectional shape, 
and as the projection they feature an inwardly proud 

rocker edge (11), relative to which the pushed-in carrier 
tube (9) is adapted to be orientated by means of locking 

and attachment screws (14) into a horizontal or vertical 
setting by swivelling the carrier tube and is held so as 

to squeeze on the tube.  
 
Mounted support according to claim 7, characterised 
in that internally on one wall (17) the angular push-in 

locator (7) matching the cross-sectional shape of the 
pushed-in carrier tube (9) features the moulded rocker 

edge (11) to which the locking and attachment screws (14) 
are allocated on the rocker edge wall (17) and the 

opposing wall (16). 
Mounted support according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterised in that the push-in locator (7) is 

constituted by a push-in collar (15) which tapers on the 
push-in side towards the push-in axis (EA) and has an 

upper wall (16) which adjoins the collar (15) and runs 
parallel to the horizontal push-in axis (EA) and a lower 

wall (17) which opposes said wall (16) and extends 
outwards obliquely thereto and to the push-in axis (EA), 

the interface between the collar (15) and the sloping wall 
(17) forming the rocker edge (11) for the carrier tube 

(9), and between this wall (17) and the pushed-in carrier 
tube (9) there is formed a swivelling and adjustment gap 

(19) for the carrier tube (9). 
Mounted support according to any of claims 7 to 9, 
characterised in that the push-in collar (15) of the push-in 

locator (7) and the lower wall (17) converge at an 
obtuse angle to form the rocker edge (11). 
Mounted support according to any of claims 7 to 10, 
characterised in that on the lower, sloping wall (17) of 

the push-in locator (7) and transversely to the push-in 
axis (EA) are arranged two locking and attachment screws 

(14) alongside one another, and on the opposing, upper 
wall (16) close to the two longitudinal extremities of the 

push-in locator (7) there are respectively arranged two 
locking and attachment screws (14) one behind the other in 

the direction of the push-in axis (EA).  
 
Mounted support according to any of claims 7 to 11,

the push-in locator (7), some distance behind the rocker 
edge (11) on the push-in side, are the two locking and 

attachment screws (14), and arranged in the upper wall 
(16) of the push-in locators (7) are two locking screws 

(14) opposing the rocker edge (11) and in alignment 
therewith and two locking and attachment screws (14)

characterised in that together with the push-in locators

masking profile (20) which runs along the outside of the
