<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
5-aminoflavone derivatives possessing antibacterial activity,
anti-estrogenic activity and antitumor activity.Indian J. of Chem. (1963) 1, 477-479 discloses 6-fluoro-8-halo flavones having no
amino groups in position 4' and 5 and lacking a substituent in position 7. EP-A-0 374
789 describes 4',5-diamino flavones bearing no fluoro in position 8 and no substituents
in positions 6 and 7, which show anti-cellular and anti-tumor activity. In Chem.
Abs. (1990) 113, 171775n, 5-amino-flavones with anti-tumor activity are described
which bear no 4'-amino substituent and no substituent in position 6. In Chem. Abs.
(1993) 119, 8593s and WPI abstract (1992) 92-384929, 5-amino-flavones bearing a
4' amino group as part of a 5-ring or 6-ring heterocycle are disclosed as cytotoxic
agents. EP-A-0 556 720 published on August 25, 1993 comprises 4',5-diamino-6,8-dihaloflavones,
lacking a substituent at position 7 which exhibit antibacterial and
antitumor activity. As other derivatives having an amino group at 5-position,
there are disclosed compounds having a hydroxyl
group at 6-position (Chem. Abst., 41, 120f (1947)), compounds
having and an alkoxy group at 3-position with antiviral
activity (EP-A-233105), compounds having anti-allergy activity
and the like (GB-A-1461777) and compounds having a methyl
group at 7-position [Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim), 322, 589
(1989)]. Further, anti-estrogenic activity is not known in
the respective flavone derivatives described above.The main object of the present invention is to
provide novel 5-aminoflavone derivatives possessing antibacterial
activity, anti-estrogenic activity and antitumor
activity.This object has been achieved by
