<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new epoxysuccinic acid derivative 
that inhibits thiol proteases such as cathepsin L and B and serves well as a 
prophylactic/therapeutic agent for bone diseases such as osteoporosis. In bone tissue, bone resorption and formation occur constantly with a 
good balance to ensure bone homeostasis; bone diseases such as osteoporosis 
are caused when the balance shifts to the bone resorption side. In recent years, various epoxy compounds possessing 
prophylactic/therapeutic activity against bone diseases have been reported 
(e.g., Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 76-1987, European 
Patent Publication No. 269311). Abbreviations for amino acids, peptides and others used in the present 
specification are based on abbreviations specified by the IUPAC-IUB 
Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature or abbreviations in common use 
in relevant fields. When an optical isomer may be present in amino acid, it is 
of the L-configuration, unless otherwise stated. Currently, bone resorption suppressors such as estrogens and 
calcitonin are used to prevent and treat osteoporosis. However, these drugs 
do not inhibit the thiol protease secreted by the lysosome of osteoclasts. Also, 
administration of these therapeutic drugs does not always offer satisfactory 
effect because they are subject to limitation as to subject, and because their 
efficacy is uncertain in some cases. With the above situation in mind, the present inventors took note of 
thiol proteases, especially cathepsin L [H. Kakegawa et al., FEBS Letters, 
Vol. 321, p. 247 (1993)], which has recently been shown to play a major role in 
bone resorption, and investigated microbial metabolites with the belief that a 
drug that selectively inhibits such cathepsin L will serve as a 
prophylactic/therapeutic agent for bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Through intensive search, the present inventors found TAN-1756A, B, 
C and D, represented by the following structural formulas, in microorganisms  
 
belonging to the genus Chaetomium, and TAN-1854A and B, represented by 
the following structural formulas, in microorganisms belonging to the genus 
Tolypocladium, TAN-1803, represented by the following structural formula, 
in a microorganism belonging to the genus Trichoderma, and TAN-1868, 
represented by the following structural formula, in a microorganism 
belonging to the genus Aspergillus. The inventors also developed methods of 
synthesizing these compounds. The inventors made further investigations of 
epoxysuccinic acid
