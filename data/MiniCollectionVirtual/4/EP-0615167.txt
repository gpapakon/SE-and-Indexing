<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing an encapsulated toner for 
heat-and-pressure fixing, which has a heat-fusible core 

material containing at least a thermoplastic resin and a 
coloring agent and a shell formed thereon so as to cover 

the surface of the core material, having the steps of 
coating the surface of the core material with a 

hydrophilic shell-forming material to form precursor 
particles; adding at least a vinyl polymerizable monomer 

and an initiator for vinyl polymerization to an aqueous 
suspension of the precursor particles to absorb them into 

the precursor particles; and then polymerizing the monomer 
components in the precursor particles. The method of the 

present invention offers toners which not only have 
improved storage stability but also are excellent in 

offset resistance, fixable at a low temperature and are 
further capable of forming clear images free from 

background.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an encapsulated toner 
for heat-and-pressure fixing used for development of 
electrostatic latent images in electrophotography, 
electrostatic printing, or electrostatic recording, and 
to a method for production thereof. As described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,297,691 and 
2,357,809 and other publications, the conventional 
electrophotography comprises the steps of forming an 
electrostatic latent image by evenly charging a 
photoconductive insulating layer and subsequently exposing 
the layer to eliminate the charge on the exposed portion 
and visualizing the formed image by adhering colored 
charged fine powder known as a toner to the latent image 
(a developing process); transferring the obtained visible 
image to an image-receiving sheet such as a transfer paper 
(a transfer process); and permanently fixing the 
transferred image by heating, pressure application or 
other appropriate means of fixing (a fixing process). As stated above, a toner must meet the requirements 
not only in the development process but also in the  
 
transfer process and fixing process. Generally, a toner undergoes mechanical frictional 
forces due to shear force and impact force during the 
mechanical operation in a developer device, thereby 
deteriorating after copying from several thousands to 
several ten thousands of sheets. Such deterioration of 
the toner can be prevented by using a tough resin having 
such a high molecular weight that it can withstand the 
above mechanical friction. However, this kind of a resin 
generally has such a high softening point that the 
resulting toner cannot be sufficiently fixed by a 
non-contact method such as oven fixing or radiant fixing 
with infrared rays, because of its poor thermal 
efficiency. Further, when the toner is fixed by a contact 
fixing method such as a heat-and-pressure fixing method 
using a heat roller, which is excellent in thermal 
efficiency and therefore widely used, it becomes necessary 
to raise the temperature of the heat roller in order to 
achieve sufficient fixing of the toner, which brings about 
such disadvantages as a deterioration of the fixing 
device, a curling of paper and an increase in energy 
consumption. Furthermore, the resin described above is 
poor in grindability, thereby remarkably lowering the 
production efficiency of the toner upon the production of 
the toner. Accordingly, the binding resin having too 
increased degree of polymerization and also too high 
softening point cannot be used.
