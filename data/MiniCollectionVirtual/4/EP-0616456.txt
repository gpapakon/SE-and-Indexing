<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multimedia
communication apparatus capable of remote control in
transmitting and receiving image and audio information.The conventional analog telephone line can only
transmit voice information in the telephone
communication, and data transmission can only be made
at a low speed.However, with the recent advancement in the fields
of communication, semiconductor and optical
communication, digital communication lines have been
developed and have enabled the high-speed transmission
of data of a large amount.The digital transmission, being featured by that
the quality of data can be maintained at a same level
without loss in the course of transmission and that
various media can be unified as a data transmission
channel matching the characteristics of media is not
required, and has thus realized transmission between
complex media terminals. Thus, instead of the 
conventional telephone for transmission of voice only,
there has been developed a multimedia communication
apparatus capable of also transmitting the image at the
same time.The audio data to be transmitted have various
formats, such as 64 Kbps (µ-law, A-law), 64 Kbps/56
Kbps/48 Kbps (SB-ADPCM), 32 Kbps (AD-PCM), 16 Kbps, 8
Kbps etc.Also the transmission of image data by the digital
line is made possible by data amount reduction through
various band compressions such as movement
compensation, frame skipping, inter- and intra-frame
compensation, DCT transformation, vector quantizing
transformation etc. An image encoding method,
acceptable for the transfer rate of 64 Kbps which is
the basic interface for the ISDN network, is the H.261
according to the ITU-T (formerly CCITT) recommendation.For enabling mutual communication between the
terminals dealing with such audio and image data,
international standardization is being promoted by
ITU-T (formerly CCITT) etc., and the rules for the
service, protocol and multimedia multiplex frame
configuration for audio visual services such as TV
telephone or TV conference utilizing digital channel
have been published as ITU-T (formerly CCITT)
recommendations H.320, H.242, H.221 etc.The recommendation H.221 defines the frame 
structure in the audio visual services from 64 to 192
Kbps, and the code allocation of FAS (frame alignment
signal) and BAS (bitrate allocation signal) in the
terminal ability exchange mode or in the communication
mode.Also H.242 defines the protocols for the ability
exchange, communication mode switching etc. between the
AV terminals employing BAS, and H.320
