<ABSTRACT>
In cup-shaped flexing contact gears (1), the respective tooth profiles of the rigid internal gear (2) and the 
cup-shaped flexible external gear (3) are each constructed such that the tooth face portion is formed of a straight 

line MA disposed in the vicinity of a datum point, a first convex circular arc AB smoothly connected thereto and a 
second convex circular arc BC smoothly connected to the first convex circular arc AB and having a radius of curvature 

larger than the first convex circular arc, while, the dedendum portion excluding the root is created by a standard rack 
consisting of a tooth profile formed by a curve point-symmetrical with respect to the datum point to the tooth profile 

at the tooth face or a curve obtained by correcting the above-mentioned curve. The curve defined by the above-described 
first and second convex circular arcs is an approximated curve of a similar curve obtained by subjecting to 

the conversion of similitude of 1/2 in the reduction ratio from the marginal point of intermeshing, which is selected 
on a composite curve to be described hereunder, this composite curve obtained by connecting a moving locus of teeth 

of the flexible external gear in a section of rotation in the vicinity of the end portion of the tooth trace on the side of a 
diaphragm to an envelope of moving loci obtained by overlapping on one plane of rotation the moving loci obtained 

by rack approximation of the external gear to the rigid internal gear in sections of rotation at the respective positions 
in the direction of tooth trace of the cup-shaped flexible external gear.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flexing-contact-type 
gear drive having a cup-shaped flexible external gear, 
and particularly to tooth profiles of a rigid internal gear 
and a flexible external gear employed in this type of gear 
drive. A flexing-contact-type gear drive typically consists 
of a rigid circular internal gear, a flexible external gear 
which has 2n (n being a positive integer) less teeth than the 
internal gear and which is disposed inside the internal gear 
and flexed into an elliptical shape so as to mesh with the 
internal gear at two places, and wave generator fitted inside 
the external gear for flexing it. The axial length of the 
flexing external gear is set approximately equal to the 
diameter thereof. The basic tooth profile for the gears of a flexing 
contact gear drive is linear (see U.S. Patent No. 2,906,143). 
On the other hand, an involute tooth profile has also been  
 
proposed by one of the inventors of the present invention (see 
Japanese Patent Publication No. SHO 45-41171). However, 
where the linear or the involute tooth profile is adopted as 
that of each of the internal and external gears, the addendum 
faces of the gears cannot be continuously meshed with each 
other. For increasing load capacity the inventor of the 
present invention proposed a system using as the basis for 
the tooth face profile the curve obtained by similarity 
transforming the locus of motion at a reduction ratio of 1/2 
over a prescribe range from the meshing limit point on the 
locus of motion based on the rack approximation of the tooth 
of the external gear relative to the internal gear determined 
by the shape of the wave generator (Japanese Patent Laid Open 
No. SHO 63-115943). However, the each of the above inventions is directed 
to a flexing contact type gear drive of the type having a 
cylindrical flexible external gear called as a flat type or a 
pan cake type. Therefore, the change in deflection along an 
axis of the flexible gear caused by coning when the cup-shaped 
flexible external gear is employed, is not taken into 
consideration. Hence, the proposed tooth profiles function 
properly at a specific section of tooth trace (for example, at 
a section of non deviation), but at the other sections, 
defects such as non contact of the teeth, tooth interference 
and the like may occur. As mentioned above, although the  
 
tooth profiles of the above inventions are effective for a 
case where the cylindrical flexible external gear is 
employed, they are not applicable for a case

A flexing contact type gear drive (1) having a rigid internal gear (2), a cup-shaped flexible 
external gear (3) disposed inside the internal gear (2), a deflection thereof being 

increased in accordance with a distance measured from a diaphragm (3b) thereof owing 
to coning from the diaphragm (3b) toward an opening (3a) thereof, and a wave generator

gear (2) at two places on a major axis of the elliptical shape and for moving the meshing
