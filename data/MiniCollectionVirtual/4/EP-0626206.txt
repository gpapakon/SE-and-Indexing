<ABSTRACT>
An adapter for use in a fixed angle centrifuge rotor has, 
in use, a radially outboard and a radially inboard portion. An 

opening (20') is formed in the radially inboard portion (12') of the 
adapter. The opening (20') is sized so that substantially no part of 

the inboard portion of the adapter is exposed during 
centrifugation to a load that exceeds the ability of the material 

of the adapter to support itself. The material of the inboard 
portion of the adapter surrounding the opening has sufficient 

strength to support itself while under centrifugation. The 
adapter is fabricated from a light transmissive material. A 

plug (24) that is slidably disposed and selectably positionable 
within the opening (20') in the inboard segment of the adapter. The 

inside surface of the plug having a sealing material (30) thereon 
that is biased into contact with a tube carried within the 

adapter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
cartridge adapter for a centrifuge tube.PCT publication WO
91/06373 discloses a cartridge adapter for supporting a sealed
centrifuge tube within a cavity of a centrifuge rotor. The
cartridge adapter comprises a pair of matable adapter
segments, each of which has an indentation therein. When the
segments are joined along mating surfaces the indentation in
each segment cooperate to define a recess having a size and
shape that closely corresponds (within a certain range of
manufacturing tolerances) to the size and shape of some
portion or all of the sealed centrifuge tube. When the cartridge
adapter is introduced into a rotor cavity one of the two
segments, termed the inboard segment Ai, lies radially closer to
the axis of rotation VCL. The inboard segment Ai has a keying
feature thereon which identifies it as the segment that is
introduced into the radially inboard side of the cavity C. The
other segment, termed the radially outboard segment Ao, lies
radially outwardly of the inboard segment and radially further
from the axis of rotation VCL.Figures 1A and 1B are top sectional views, taken in a
plane transverse to the longitudinal axis of a prior art sealed
plastic centrifuge tube T illustrating the inboard and outboard
segments Ai, Ao, respectively, of a cartridge adapter as they
support the tube T within a cavity C of a rotor V, illustrated as
a vertical angle rotor. At rest, as shown in Figure 1A, the
inside surfaces of the respective inboard and outboard
segments Ai and Ao of the adapter lie (within dimensional
tolerances) close to or in physical contact with the exterior 
surface of the sealed tube about its entire circumference. It is
noted that the inside surfaces of the adapter segments lie in
this disposition with respect to the tube throughout the tube's
entire axial length. That is, for each transverse section along
the longitudinal axis of the tube, the relationship shown in
Figure 1A is maintained.With reference to Figure 1B, as the rotor is spun about
the axis of rotation VCL the tube T is exposed both to a radially
outwardly directed force Fc and an internal hydrostatic
pressure force Fh. The force Fc is caused by the mass of the
tube itself under centrifugal load. The force Fh is caused by the
mass of the liquid contents of the tube under centrifugal load.
In a first portion P1 of the tube, viz., a portion of the tube T
received in the radially inboard segment Ai, the vector sum of
the forces Fc and Fh is such that the tube deflects radially
outwardly to

<CLAIMS>
An assembly of a fixed angle centrifuge rotor (V),
an adapter (10;10') and a centrifuge tube (T) for

use within a cavity (C) of the rotor (V), the adapter
(10;10') having, while being spun, a portion that

lies radially inboard and a portion that lies radially
outboard with respect to an axis of rotation

(VCL), the adapter (10;10') having a recess (16)
sized to receive the centrifuge tube (T),
characterized by

the inboard portion of the adapter (10;10') having
an opening (20;20') therein, located in an area (P
1
)
in which the centrifuge tube (T) imparts stress

while being spun, thus reducing the deflection of
the adapter (10;10') in that area (P
1
).
The assembly of claim 1 wherein the adapter (10;10')
has an inboard (12;12') and an outboard (14;14')

segment, the inboard segment (12;12') and the outboard
segment (14;14') each have an indentation

(12I,14I) therein which cooperate to define the recess
(16) sized to receive the centrifuge tube (T).
The assembly of claim 2 wherein the material of the
inboard (12;12') and outboard (14;14') segments is a

light transmissive material.
The assembly of claim 2 or 3 comprising a plug (24)
slidably disposed and selectably positionable within

the opening (20') in the inboard segment (12'). 
The assembly of claim 4 wherein the plug (24) has an
inside and an outside surface thereon, the inside

surface of the plug (24) having a sealing material
(30) thereon.
The assembly of claim 5 wherein the dimension of the
plug (24) being such that the sealing material (30)

is biased into contact with a tube (T) received
within the adapter (10').
