<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new peptides and new proteins, to a process
for their preparation, and to their use as cholesterol acceptors.Atherosclerosis, and its attendant complications such as coronary heart
disease in particular are among the most common and critical health problems
today. A number of risk factors have been implicated in the development of
"premature" atherosclerosis, one of the most important of these being elevated
plasma cholesterol. Because of the crucial role that cholesterol appears to play in
the occurrence of heart disease, a great deal of attention has been devoted to the
study of its metabolism in the human body.The major function of the apolipoproteins is to carry lipids including
cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides in plasma and to deliver these lipids to
a variety of cells (Pownall et al., 1987; Kovanen et al., 1990). These lipid-apolipoprotein
complexes constitute the different classes of the plasma lipoproteins.
Most of the smaller water-soluble apolipoproteins have a high alpha-helical
content, and contain several amphipathic segments with a high degree of homology
(De Loof et al., 1987; Brasseur et al., 1990). Low density lipoproteins are
involved in the delivery of cholesterol to peripheral cells (Brown et al., 1986;
Gianturco et al., 1987), while high density lipoproteins (HDL) are responsible for
the transport of excess cholesterol from the peripheral tissues to the liver, i.e.,
"reverse cholesterol transport". Several mechanisms have been proposed to account
for the targeting of the HDL to the liver. These include the uptake of apoE-rich
HDL1, the direct uptake of HDL2 after the enzymatic action of hepatic lipase on
HDL3, and the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL2 to apoB containing
lipoproteins under the action of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).
Lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) are
enzymes which play major roles in the conversion of the nascent discoidal HDL
and of the small HDL3 particles, which act as acceptors of cholesterol from
peripheral cells, into larger HDL2 particles (Phillips et al., 1987). These are
further catabolized, thus directing the flux of cholesterol to the liver. It has now
been well documented (Delamatre et al., 1986) that apo AI, representing the major
apoprotein constituent of HDL, is the major apoprotein involved in these
processes.Synthetic peptides, mostly 18-22 residues long, have been used as models for
the study of helix-lipid interactions in an
