<ABSTRACT>
Polyamide is semi-continuously depolymerized by: (a) charging the polyamide to a 
depolymerization reactor containing 5 to 50% by weight of an unpolymerized catalyst; 

(b) melting the polyamide and subjecting the resultant melt to a flow of superheated 
steam to obtain a steam distillate; (c) separating amide monomers in the distillate from 

other volatiles therein; (d) when conversion to amide monomers is 40 to 90% complete, 
recharging polyamide to the depolymerization reactor; and (e) repeating steps (a) - (d) 

until a desired amount of polyamide is depolymerized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the catalytic depolymerization of 
polycondensation polymers. More particularly, this invention relates to semi-continuous 
catalytic depolymerization of polyamides. As used herein the term "semi-continuous process" means a process where 
polyamide is periodically recharged to a depolymerization reactor after the previous 
charge is partially exhausted. Large quantities of polymeric waste accumulate from polymer processing and 
post-consumer waste. Recycling and reuse of materials is an ever-growing topic of 
research and development. Any process which enhances the ability to reclaim reusable 
materials from waste has extreme value. It is generally known that polycondensation 
products, like polyamides, can be depolymerized to some or all of the backbone 
monomers. Processes for depolymerizing nylon 6 are known. F. Mikula, K. Petru, "The 
Depolymerization of Polycaprolactam Wastes to Monomeric 6-Caprolactam", Chemicky 
Prumysl, 17, 1967, pp. 132-137, describe a process for catalytically depolymerizing nylon 
6 to ε-caprolactam. Boric acid (and derivatives) is the authors' preferred catalyst due 
to experiments showing a better depolymerization rate than with phosphoric acid.  
 
Catalysts are charged at up to 1.0%. L. A. Dmitrieva, A. A. Speranskii, S. A. Krasavin and Y. N. Bychkov, 
"Regeneration of ε-Caprolactam From Wastes In the Manufacture of Polycaproamide 
Fibres and Yarns", Fibre Chemistry, March 1986, (translated from Khimicheskie 
Volokna, No. 4, pp. 5-12, July-August, 1985) is a literature review describing processes 
for depolymerizing nylon 6 with and without using a catalyst. Nylon 6 depolymerization kinetics are described by A. A. Ogale, 
"Depolymerization of Nylon 6:Some Kinetic Modeling Aspects", Journal of Applied 
Polymer Science, Vol. 29, 1984, pp. 3947-3954. Relatively low concentrations (0.2 to 
1.05%) of catalysts were used. Numerous disadvantages and problems with catalyzed nylon 6 depolymerization 
have been disclosed. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,939,153 to Fowler discloses a non-catalytic 
depolymerization process to resolve the consumption of ortho-phosphoric 
catalyst and consequent decrease in the rate of caprolactam recovery. I. Mladenov, T. 
Vladkova, S. Fakirov and A Mitsulov, "X-Ray Diffraction and IR Spectroscopic 
Investigation of the Products of the Reaction Between Poly-ε-Capro-amide and Ortho-Phosphoric 
Acid", Pol. Sci. USSR, Vol No. 20, 1978, pp. 341-346, indicate the formation 
of oligoamidophosphates. Takashi Ohtsubo,

A process for the semi-continuous depolymerization of a polyamide having a melting 
point comprising: 


(a) charging polyamide to a depolymerization reactor containing 5 to 50% by weight 
of an unpolymerized catalyst; 
(b) melting the polyamide and subjecting the resultant melt to a flow of 
superheated steam to obtain a steam distillate; 
(c) separating amide monomers in the distillate from other volatiles therein; 
(d) when conversion to amide monomers is 40 to 90% complete, recharging 
polyamide to the depolymerization reactor; and 
(e) repeating steps (a) - (e) until a desired amount of polyamide is depolymerized. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said charging is of nylon 6 and the amide monomer 
is ε-caprolactam. 
The process of claim 1 or 2 wherein said charging is to a depolymerization reactor 
containing a catalyst selected from the group consisting of ortho-phosphoric acid and p-toluenesulfonic 

acid. 
The process of claims 1 to 3 wherein said melting is to a melt temperature 
at least 25°C above the melting point of the polymer but no higher than 320°C. 
The process of claims 1 to 4 wherein said polyamide is nylon 6 waste, 
comprising essentially polyamide 6, additives and/or impurities. 
The process of claim 5 wherein the additives and impurities are selected 
of the group consisting essentially of pigments, pigment carriers, 

calcium carbonate, nucleating agents, antioxidants, stabilizers, fiber 
finishes, polypropylene backing, styrene-butadiene latex and metal parts.
