<ABSTRACT>
The saturation effects observed in an MQW electro-absorption 
modulator are reduced by modifying the composition of the MQW 

structure so that the barrier layers (35,36), that are interleaved with 
the quantum well layers (34), are in tension.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electro-absorption optical modulators,
particularly to the type of such modulator that incorporate reverse-biased
multiquantum well (MQW) structures, and is concerned with
saturation effects liable to occur in such modulators.For the purposes of this specification, a distinction is drawn between
a multi-quantum well (MQW) structure of interleaved quantum well
layers and barrier layers, and a superlattice structure, similarly of
interleaved quantum well layers and barrier layers. This distinction is
that, in an MQW structure, the barrier layers are thick enough to
preclude any substantial band structure interaction between adjacent
quantum well layers; whereas, in a superlattice structure, the barrier
layers are specifically and deliberately thin enough to provide
interaction sufficient to produce a mini-band structure.Saturation effects observed in MQW electro-absorption modulators
result from the slow escape of photon-generated carriers from the
reverse-biased quantum wells. It is believed that these effects are
liable to be more pronounced in semiconductor systems, such as
InGaAsP/lnP and InGaAs/lnp systems, in which the valence band
steps on both sides of the quantum well layers are significantly
larger than the corresponding conduction band steps. A paper by B
W Takasawi et al, entitled "Observation of Separate Electron and
Hole Escape Rates in Unbiased Strained InGaAsP Multiple
Quantum Well Laser Structures", Applied Physics Letters, 62 (20),
17 May 1993 pp 2525-7, describes measurements made to assess
the escape times of photo-generated electrons and holes generated 
in a multiquantum well structure comprising quantum wells made of
InGaAsP interleaved with barrier layers made of InP. The analysis
shows that, in this InGaAsP/InP semiconductor system, the hole
escape times are significantly longer than the corresponding
electron escape times, but that the hole escape times can be
reduced from about 18ns, in the case of examples with unstrained
quantum wells, to about 10 ns in the case of examples where the
quantum well composition is chosen to put the quantum wells in
1.2% compression, and to about 13 ns in the case of examples
where the quantum well composition is instead chosen to put the
quantum wells in tension. These reductions in hole escape times,
which are attributed to thermally assisted tunnelling effects via
higher energy levels (a light hole in the case of compressively
strained quantum wells, and a heavy hole in the case of those that
are in tensile strain),

<CLAIMS>
An electro-absorption optical modulator having a substrate
(30) of a first composition material supporting a set of epitaxially

grown layers (31 to 39) defining a p-i-n architecture that includes a
multiquantum well structure comprising a plurality of quantum well

layers of a second composition material, which quantum well layers
(34) are interleaved with barrier layers (35, 36) of a third

composition material, wherein the barrier layers are thick enough to
preclude any substantial band structure interaction between

adjacent quantum well layers, and which modulator is characterised
in that the third composition material has a smaller unstrained lattice

constant than that of the first composition material, whereby the
barrier layers are put in tensile strain, and

the second composition material has a larger unstrained
lattice constant than that of the first composition material, whereby

the quantum well layers are put in compressive strain.

wherein the unstrained lattice constant of the first composition

material exceeds that of the third composition material by at least
