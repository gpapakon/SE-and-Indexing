<ABSTRACT>
An X-ray examination apparatus is provided with an exposure control 
means for controlling the X-ray source and for adjusting the signal amplification of the 

television camera which converts the image on the exit window of the X-ray image 
intensifier into a video signal. The signal amplification of the television camera is 

adjustable so as to enable the reproduction of a wide dynamic range of images on the 
exit window with adequate image contrast and image brightness. In order to avoid 

annoying transitions in image brightness due to the variation of control signals provided 
by the exposure control means, exposure control in an X-ray examination apparatus is 

operative to supply a control signal which varies smoothly in response to changes in 
image brightness and image contrast, for example during fluoroscopy where a series of 

images is formed by X-ray exposure. In a preferred embodiment of the invention there 
is supplied a control signal which varies linearly as a function of mean brightness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an X-ray examination apparatus, comprising an 
X-ray source for forming an X-ray image by irradiation of an object by means of X-rays, 
an X-ray image intensifier for converting the X-ray image into an optical image, 
and an image pick-up device for forming an electronic image signal from the optical 
image, which image pick-up device comprises an exposure control device for applying a 
control signal, derived from the electronic image signal, to a control input of an 
amplifier of the image pick-up device, which exposure control means comprises a 
selector for selecting at least one measuring field in the optical image, a maximum 
detector for detecting a maximum level derived from a maximum value of signal 
amplitudes of the image signal corresponding to at least one measuring field, a 
minimum detector for detecting a minimum level derived from a minimum value of 
signal amplitudes of the image signal corresponding to at least one measuring field, and 
a mean value detector for detecting a mean level derived from a mean value of signal 
amplitudes of the image signal corresponding to at least one measuring field. An X-ray examination apparatus of this kind is known from German 
Auslegeschrift DE 26 10 845. The known X-ray examination apparatus utilizes the mean value of the 
image signal in the measuring field as an X-ray control signal for controlling a power 
supply for the X-ray source in order to control the exposure time, or the X-ray pulse 
duration, so as to achieve adequate image contrast and image brightness and to limit the 
X-ray dose whereto a patient to be examined is exposed. The known X-ray examination 
apparatus comprises a selector switch for selecting one of six predefined measuring 
fields. Furthermore, in the known X-ray examination apparatus the relative difference 
between a maximum signal amplitude and a minimum signal amplitude is used for the 
control signal for adjustment of the signal amplification of the electronic image signal. 
The amplifier derives an amplified video signal from the electronic image signal, which 
video signal is applied to a monitor for display of an image. In the case of such control  
 
of the signal amplification, involving only the minimum and the maximum signal 
amplitudes without taking into account notably the mean signal amplitude, sudden 
transitions often occur in the image brightness of an image displayed on the monitor in 
the event of variation of objects reproduced in the measuring field of the optical image.
