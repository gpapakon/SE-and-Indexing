<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a luminaire with suspension devices for suspending and folding away a louvre (13,15) inserted in the luminaire housing (11), the suspension devices in each case comprising: a support (26) which can be moved up and down between an upper position and a lower position in an anchoring part (33) connected to the luminaire housing (11), and which, for taking off the louvre, can be detached from the anchoring part, and a holding part (17), in each case connected to the longitudinal reflector (13) of the luminaire louvre, with bearing holes (24) into which the lower ends (21) of the support (26) are inserted so as to be able to swivel about a horizontal axis. According to the invention, the support (26) is a spring clip, bent from a wire, whose lower bow ends (21) are bent outwards and penetrate the bearing holes (24) of the bearing limbs (22), arranged in the lower region of the holding part (17), so that the holding part (17) can swivel, together with the louvre, about the horizontal axis of rotation, provided by the bow ends of the spring clips (26). The solution according to the invention permits simple operation of the suspension device and cost-effective production of the individual parts of the suspension device.
