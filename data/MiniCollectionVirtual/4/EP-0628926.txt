<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus in which a font whose 
use is intended to be restricted to a particular purpose, 

such as a specific emulation program, is identified in 
such manner as to prevent its use otherwise than as 

intended.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an output apparatus and
method capable of specifying at least one useful output
mode corresponding to given font data.There are two types of font in a character output
apparatus such as a printing apparatus: ordinary fonts,
and exclusive fonts for use by emulation programs.
Ordinary fonts include internal fonts, provided in the
apparatus, and card fonts supplied by a card. These fonts
are stored in a table in the apparatus when power is
turned on.An exclusive font for emulating is permitted to be used in
accordance with a specific emulation program. If the
characters of such an exclusive font are the same, or 
nearly the same, in appearance as those of one of the
ordinary fonts in the printer (that is, the two fonts may
differ only in, e.g., the range of sizes to which
characters can be scaled), the exclusive font is stored in
the table with the internal font.If the output apparatus supports an emulation and the
exclusive font provided for use with the emulation program
is the same, or nearly the same, in appearance as some
internal font, that exclusive font may prove to be usable
by other emulation programs. In this case, it is
difficult to distinguish among these emulation programs,
which may give rise to a problem of copyright.Some output apparatus have a function for storing non-internal-font
characters which are produced by users, as
font patterns, thus rendering such non-internal-font
character patterns available for use as a font for
printing whenever desired. A font stored in the table can
be used by any processing language. In the case of an
output apparatus which can store a non-internal character
font and which supports many emulation programs, also, a
stored non-internal character font for an specific
emulation program can, unfortunately, be used for other
emulation programs.Font format can affect these problems. If each emulation
font has a different format from other such fonts, an
exclusive font intended for a specific emulation can be
used only for that emulation.The present invention has been made in consideration of
the above situation, and has as one of its concerns, to 
provide an output method and apparatus capable of
permitting flexible selection of a font.The invention is set forth in independent claims 1, 9, 17 and 18.Other features and adavantages of the
invention will be more fully understood from a
consideration of the following detailed description of the
preferred embodiments, taken in conjunction with the
accompanying drawings, in which like

<CLAIMS>
A character output apparatus for outputting
character patterns in response to received instructions,

the apparatus having storage means storing font data, and
having a plurality of modes including an emulation mode

and output means for outputting character data processed
by one of said modes, and 
characterised
by
 storage means (30) adapted to store information
indicating which font stored in the apparatus can be

utilised by an emulation program in the emulation mode,
and means (CPU3) for determining whether or not a font

can be used by an emulation program on the basis of the
information stored in said storage means.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
storage means stores a table containing data relating to

each emulation program, and wherein the information
includes an emulation flag (34) indicating a usable font

for one or more emulation programs.
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein each
emulation program has an emulation number (41 e) stored

in an emulation font information means (41). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein said
determining means (CPU3) are adapted to judge (S17) for

an emulation program whether or not the emulation flag is
"on", and to set a font selection enabling flag (33) to "on"

in response to a judgement that the emulation flag
indicates "on".
Apparatus according to claim 4, and having a card
font, and wherein said determining means is adapted to

set (S11) to "on" a font selection enabling flag in
respect of the internal font of the apparatus and/or of

the card font.
Apparatus according to claim 5 wherein said
determining means are adapted to set (S12) to "off" the

font selection enabling flag in respect of the emulation
font.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim
including output means (8) for outputting a character

generated by utilising an emulation.
Apparatus according to claim 7 wherein the output
means comprise an ink jet printer or a laser beam

printer. 
A method of outputting character patterns in
response to received instructions using an output

apparatus having a plurality of modes including an
emulation mode the method comprising storing in storage

means (30) information indicating which font stored in
the apparatus can be utilised by an emulation program in

the emulation mode, determining whether or not a font can
be used by the emulation program on the basis of the

information stored in said storage means, processing
input data in a selected one of a plurality of modes to

generate character data, and outputting the generated
character data.
A method according to claim 9, wherein said
storage means stores a table containing data relating to

each emulation program, and wherein the information
includes an emulation flag (34) indicating a usable font

for one or more emulation programs.
A method according to claim 10 wherein each
emulation program has an emulation number (41 e) stored

in an emulation font information means (41).
A method according to claim 11, including judging
(S17) for an emulation program whether or not the 

emulation flag (34) is "on", and setting a font selection
enabling flag (33) to "on" in response to a judgement that the

emulation flag indicates "on".
A method according to claim 12, wherein the
apparatus includes a card font, and setting (S11) to "on"

a font selection enabling font flag in respect of the
internal font of 
the apparatus and/or of the card font.
A method according to claim 13 including setting
(512) to "off" the font selection enabling flag in

respect of the emulation font.
A method according to any one of claims 9 to 14
including outputting a character generated by

utilising an emulation.
A method according to claim 15 wherein
the character is output by an ink jet printer or a laser

beam printer.
A storage medium storing processor implementable
instructions for controlling a processor to carry out the

method of any one of claims 9 to 16. 
An electrical signal carrying processor
implementable instructions for controlling a processor to

carry out the method of any one of claims 9 to 16.
