<ABSTRACT>
The container is formed from a blank (1) having already the tongues 
(T) intended to form in a manner per se known the automatic bottom of 

the container. The blank (1) comprises a rectangular zone (2) with a 
glueing edge (L) intended to form the lateral wall of the container, a 

strip (D) projecting from the side of the rectangular zone (2) 
corresponding to the bottom of the container and having curved folding 

lines (S) from which the tongues (T) of the automatic bottom extend, 
each curved folding line (S) having a radius of curvature identical or 

different according to the cross-section of the cylindrical container 
to be formed. This strip (D) is folded against the rectangular zone 

(2) of the blank (1) and glued thereto. The tongues (T) of the 
automatic bottom have at least a curved side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to containers made of 
cardboard or the like, having an automatic bottom and, more particularly, 
to a container of the above mentioned kind capable of taking 
a substantially cylindrical shape during the assembly. The containers made of cardboard or the like, having an automatic 
bottom are already known. Their very important feature is to have a 
so-called "automatic bottom" that is a bottom which is self-forming 
during their assembly. In order to obtain the automatic bottom the 
blank intended to form the container is provided with suitably shaped 
bottom tongues having mutual engagement means. These bottom tongues 
are glued in pairs to each other and once the longitudinal edges of 
the blank have been glued therebetween and the assembly of the container 
is started by transforming it from a flattened or bidimensional 
shape, as it is put on the market, to the final open or tridimensional 
shape, the so glued bottom tongues are brought in such a position as 
to form the bottom wall of the container and are retained in this 
final position by the mutual engagement of the engagement means. By means of this system containers having in plan view poligonal 
shapes, for example square, rectangular, pentagonal, esagonal shape 
etc. have been developed.  
 DE-A-40 33 947 discloses a packing container corresponding to the container 
according to the entering clause of claim 1 formed from a flat blank. 
In this blank only two folding lines, which are diametrically opposed 
when the container is in its final condition of use, are extending 
between an upper edge and a lower edge of the side wall of the 
container. In this manner the container can be brought in a flat 
condition. Projecting from the upper zone of the lower edge are 
tongues which are foldable about linear folding lines. These tongues 
form an automatically closing bottom when a pressure is exerted on the 
two folding lines of the side wall of the container. In order to bring 
the container in its final condition of use the linear folding lines 
of the tongues have a lenght which is only a portion of the tongue 
width. Furthermore, the tongues on the side confronting the lower edge 
have curved lines. In this container the bottom tongues are attached 
to the side wall through small segments only and this can impair the 
container because the bottom tongues could get detached. US-A-2 189 436 discloses a container comprising a collapsible tubular 
member, quadrantal flaps integral with the bottom of said

<CLAIMS>
Container made of cardboard or the like having generally a 
cylindrical shape and an automatically closing bottom obtained from a 

blank with bottom tongues (T; 5,6,7,8) having mutually engagement means for 
automatically closing the bottom during the formation of the 

container, said blank comprising a rectangular zone (2) having only 
two folding lines (3,4) perpendicular to the side corresponding to the 

bottom of the container in order to allow the container to be put on 
the market in a flattened shape and to be opened in its final 

tridimensional shape upon the use, a glueing edge (L) on one of the 
sides perpendicular to the side corresponding to the bottom of the 

container and intended to form the lateral wall thereof, characterized 
in that said blank further comprises:
