<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new system board receptacle 
and to new interchangeable integrated circuit packages for 
respective multiple and single power supply systems and 
subsystems. In particular, the invention relates to new 
complementary pad and pin configurations for the pads of a 
system board IC package receptacle and the pins of 
alternative IC devices to be inserted in the receptacle. 
The system board can provide multiple power supplies. The 
complementary pad and pin configurations can accommodate an 
IC device requiring multiple incompatible power supplies and 
signal logic voltage levels or an IC device requiring a 
single power supply and compatible signal logic voltage 
levels. The invention is applied for example to receive 
alternative translator and transceiver IC devices in the 
same IC package receiver without modifying the system board. In 1992 the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council 
(JEDEC) of the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) 
adopted a new low voltage integrated circuit standard based 
on a 3.3v power supply. This new low voltage standard is 
designated the JEDEC Standard 8-1A and is now commonly known 
as the 3v standard. The new JEDEC Standard 8-1A at nominal 
3.3v is to be contrasted with the conventional integrated 
circuit JEDEC Standards 18 & 20 with a 5v power supply. The 
3v and 5v standards are incompatible with respect to voltage 
levels of the respective power supplies and the logic high 
and low potential level signals generated by the two 
different circuits. For the conventional 5v standard, a CMOS logic low 
potential level signal is typically in the range of 0.4v -  
 
0.55v while a logic high potential level signal is in the 
range of 3.65v - 4.0v. For the new 3v standard, JEDEC 
Standard 8-1A, a CMOS logic low potential level signal is 
also typically in the range of 0.4v - 0.55v while the logic 
high potential level signal is in the range of 2.0v - 2.4v. 
Because of the incompatibility of the 3v and 5v standard 
supply voltage levels and the respective CMOS logic high and 
low potential level signals, translation is required for 
communication between 3v and 5v standard subcircuits. The 
new low voltage standard for a power supply at nominal 3.3v 
is applicable for CMOS, bipolar, and BICMOS technology IC's. Applications for the new 3v standard include notebook 
sub-notebook, hand held, and pen based portable and mobile 
personal computers, generally referred to as personal 
digital assistants or PDA's. The 3v standard requires less 
power
