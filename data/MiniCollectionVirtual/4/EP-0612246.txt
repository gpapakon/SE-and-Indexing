<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are pharmaceutical compositions that comprise gallium complexes of 3-hydroxy-4-pyrones. These compositions provide enhanced gallium bioavailability particularly when orally administered as compared to the gallium bioavailability achieved by use of pharmaceutical compositions containing gallium salts. Compositions included in this invention are useful in providing gallium to humans and other mammals for a wide variety of medical and veterinary applications, including the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of hypercalcemia, certain cancers, certain disorders of calcium homeostasis, and certain bone diseases including osteoporosis, osteopenia, and Paget's disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical gallium
compositions, particularly those having enhanced oral
bioavailability relative to simple gallium salts and
methods for their use. Gallium has demonstrated
pharmaceutical value for the treatment of many human
and animal disorders, including hypercalcemia, cancer,
and especially certain widespread degenerative or
metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis and
Paget's disease.The following references are cited in this
