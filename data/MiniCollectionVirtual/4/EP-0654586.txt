<ABSTRACT>
The inner shroud (48) of the vane of a vane 
assembly for the compressor section of a gas turbine 

engine is fabricated from a composite material 
preferably carbon fibers and imide resin and is formed 

into an open ended box-like member segment supporting no 
less than two vanes or airfoils (44,46). The segments 

are interlocked by a necked down edge adapted to slip 
into the open end of the adjacent inner shroud of the 

stator vane that serve to seal the gas path and provide 
damping. Rub strips (66,68) may be integrally formed on 

the bottom surface of the inner shroud.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stator vanes for gas 
turbine engines and particularly to a composite vane and 
inner shroud. U.S. Patent Number 3,275,294 granted on September 
27, 1966 to J. M. Allen and A. J. Scalzo entitled 
"Elastic Fluid Apparatus" discloses a box-like element 
on the inner diameter of the stator vane that when 
assembled define an annular vane construction for a gas 
turbine engine. The inner shroud or base portions 
carries interlocking means for interlocking adjacent 
vanes. The fit of the interlocking means is such that 
it provides damping. A band formed from relatively thin 
strip rigidly connects to each of the base members to 
hold them in frictional engagement relative to each 
other while permitting radial expansion. The method of 
bonding the thin strip to the base member is by welding 
which would require that each of the members are 
metallic. CH-A-489699 (Gebrüder Sulzer AG) discloses a stator 
vane assembly comprising a row of spaced stator vanes 
for passing engine fluid working medium in a gas turbine 
engine, said assembly comprising a plurality of 
prefabricated stator segments mounted end to end to form 
a ring, each segment comprising an outer shroud portion, 
an inner shroud portion and at least two stator vanes 
extending between said inner and outer shroud portions; 
said inner shroud portion being a box-like structure 
having a top wall joined to the inner end of said stator 
vanes, a bottom wall, and a pair of opposing parallel 
side walls, said top wall, said bottom wall and said 
pair of opposing parallel side walls defining a channel, 
and means formed on the ends of the channel for 
interlocking adjacent inner shroud arcuate segments.  
 As is well known in the aeronautical art, it is 
highly desirable to reduce the weight of engine 
component parts inasmuch as such a reduction translates 
into fuel savings and/or greater payload capacity. One 
area that has proven to lend itself to being fabricated 
from composite materials is the fan/compressor section 
of the engine. Since this area during aircraft 
operations can become relatively warm and encounter 
extremely high stresses, only certain composite 
materials have proven to be satisfactory for this 
environment. One of the materials that have proven to 
exhibit satisfactory characteristics is the imide resin 
and carbon fiber family of composite materials. 
However, because of the characteristics of this 
material, fabrication of the vane has been particularly 
difficult. The invention is distinguished

<CLAIMS>
A stator vane assembly (20) comprising a row of 
spaced stator vanes (44,46) for passing engine fluid 

working medium in a gas turbine engine, said assembly 
comprising a plurality of prefabricated stator segments 

(42) mounted end to end to form a ring, each segment 
comprising an outer shroud portion (50), an inner shroud 

portion (48) and at least two stator vanes (44,46) 
extending between said inner and outer shroud portions; 

said inner shroud portion being a box-like structure 
having a top wall (52) joined to the inner end of said 

stator vanes, a bottom wall (54), and a pair of opposing 
parallel side walls (56,58), said top wall, said bottom 

wall and said pair of opposing parallel side walls 
defining a channel, and means formed on the ends of the 

channel for interlocking adjacent inner shroud arcuate 
segments;
 
   characterised in that said stator segments are 

formed of a composite material and in that said channels 
in said inner shroud portions are open ended channels 

aligned to form an annular shaped passageway in said 
ring. 
A stator as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
composite material is taken from the group consisting of 

carbon fibers and imide resins. 
A stator as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein said 
interlocking means includes a necked down portion formed 

on the end of adjacent box-like structures. 
A stator as claimed in claim 3 wherein said necked 
down portion fits slidingly into the open ended channel 

of the adjacent segments, whereby the cooperation of 
said necked down portion and the open ended channel 

dampen vibratory energy imposed on said stator.  
 
A stator as claimed in any preceding claim 
including at least one rub strip (66,68) provided on the 

outer face of said bottom wall and adapted to engage a 
sealing element attached to the shaft of said gas 

turbine engine. 
A stator as claimed in any preceding claim wherein 
said box-like structure is rectangularly shaped. 
A stator as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5 wherein 
said box-like structure is irregularly shaped. 
A stator as claimed in claim 7 wherein said box-like 
structure includes a forward portion and an 

adjoining rearward portion and said forward portion and 
said rearward portion being in stepped relationship 

relative to each other. 
A stator as claimed in any preceding claim wherein 
each of said at least two stator vanes (44,46) is formed 

integrally with said inner shroud portion (48). 
A stator as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
each of said at least two stator vanes (44, 46) is 

formed integrally with said inner shroud portion (48) 
and said outer shroud portion (50).
