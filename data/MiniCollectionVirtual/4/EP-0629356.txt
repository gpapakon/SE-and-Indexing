<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a process for the simultaneous production of at least one fibre strand, at least one fibre strip being drawn off a supply (7), the at least one drawn-off fibre strip being fed for treatment, in the case of which the fibre strip is, inter alia, stretched and puffed up, the at least one treated fibre strip being brought together, in a formatting device (3), to form a fibre strand or filter strands (27.1, 27.2) which are provided with a sheathing material (23) in order to form one or more continuous, sheathed fibre strands, in particular filter strands (27.1, 27.2), the fibre strip or the fibre strips being subjected, at the beginning of the treatment, to a braking force in order to adjust the quantity to be processed and/or other properties of the fibre strip or of the fibre strips, the braking force being automatically adjusted. A description is given of two apparatuses which are particularly suitable for carrying out this process. The invention permits a higher degree of productivity along with the same good quality of the fibre strands or filter strands produced.
