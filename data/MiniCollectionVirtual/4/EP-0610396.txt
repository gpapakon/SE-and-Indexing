<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the use of oligonucleotide
probes directed to interspersed, non-coding repetitive DNA sequence elements to identify bacteria.
More particularly, it relates to the use of these probes as primers for the
amplification of bacterial genomic DNA between repetitive sequences, and
the use of these amplification products to construct DNA fingerprints
unique to the probed genome. It also relates to the disclosure of specific
primers which are useful as oligonucleotide probes in the practice of this
invention. In the context of this invention repetitive DNA sequences
mean interspersed, non-coding repetitive DNA sequences.Interspersed non-coding repetitive DNA sequence elements have been
characterized extensively in eucaryotes although their function still
remains largely unknown. The conserved nature and interspersed
distribution of these repetitive sequences have been exploited to amplify
unique sequences between repetitive sequences by the polymerase chain
reaction. Additionally, species-specific repetitive DNA elements have been
used to differentiate between closely related murine species.Prokaryotic genomes are much smaller than the genomes of
mammalian species (approximately 106 versus 109 base pairs of DNA,
respectively). Since these smaller prokaryotic genomes are maintained
through selective pressures for rapid DNA replication and cell
reproduction the non-coding repetitive DNA should be kept to a minimum
unless maintained by other selective forces. For the most part
prokaryotes have a high density of transcribed sequences. Nevertheless,
families of short intergenic repeated sequences occur in bacteria. The presence of repetitive sequences has been demonstrated in
many different bacterial species. Reports of novel repeated sequences in
the eubacterial genera, Escherichia, Salmonella, Deinococcus, Calothrix,
and Neisseria, and the fungi, Candida albicans and Pneumocystis carinii,
illustrate the presence of dispersed extragenic repetitive sequences in
many organisms. One such family of repetitive DNA sequences in
eubacteria is the Repetitive Extragenic Palindromic (REP) elements. The
consensus REP sequence for this family includes a 38 mer sequence
containing six totally degenerate positions, including a 5 bp variable loop
between each side of the conserved stem of the palindrome. Another
family of repetitive elements is the Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic
Consensus (ERIC) sequences. ERIC is larger (consensus sequence is 126-mer)
and contains a highly
