<ABSTRACT>
Using the title semiconductor device, a synapse circuit through which no steady-state current flows, whose positive and negative 
weights can be realized by a single 5-V current, and which has a self-learning function is realized. This semiconductor device 

comprises first and second power source lines which supply high and low two potentials a first NMOS having a first floating 
gate, and a second PMOS having a second floating gate. The source and drain of the first NMOS are connected to the second 

and first power source lines through third NMOS and fourth PMOS, respectively. The source and drain of the second PMOS are 
connected in the first and second power source lines through fifth PMOS and sixth NMOS, respectively. The sources of the first 

NMOS and second PMOS are connected to the thrid floating gate through first and second capacitors, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
device, and in particular, relates to a semiconductor 
device which is applied to the construction of a high-performance 
neural network. The pace of development in the integrated circuit 
technology of semiconductors has been surprisingly rapid, 
so that, for example, to use the example of dynamic memory, 
memories having a capacity of from 4 megabits to 16 
megabits are already in mass production, and extremely high 
density memories having a capacity of 64 megabits or more 
are being developed at the research level. In 64 megabit 
memories, approximately 120,000,000 MOS transistors are 
integrated on a silicon chip which is, at most, 1 
centimeter square. Such ultra-LSI technology has been 
applied not merely to memory circuits, but also to logic 
circuits, and various high-function logical integrated 
circuits, beginning with CPUs of from 32 bits to 64 bits, 
have been developed. However, these logical circuits adopt a method in 
which operations are conducted using digital signals, that 
is to say, signals having one of the two values "1" and 
"0", so that, for example, in the case in which a computer  
 
is constructed therefrom, a method, termed the "Neumann 
method," is employed in which commands are executed one by 
one according to a program which is determined in advance. 
When such a method is employed, extremely rapid operations 
are possible with respect to simple numerical calculations; 
however, an extremely large amount of time is required for 
operations such as pattern recognition or image processing. 
Furthermore, such a method is extremely poor with respect 
to data processing at which human beings excel, such as 
association, learning, or the like, and presently, research 
into various types of software technologies is being 
conducted; however, the current state of affairs is such 
that rapid results are not being attained. Here, in order to solve these problems, research has 
been conducted along a different line in which the 
functioning of the brains of animals has been studied, and 
attempts have been made to develop a computer which 
conducts operational processing in a manner which imitates 
such functioning, that is to say, to develop a neural 
circuit computer (neuron computer). Such research began in the 1940s; however, in recent 
years, extremely active research has been conducted in the 
field. The reason for this is that in accordance with the 
progress in LSI technology, it has become possible to 
construct the
