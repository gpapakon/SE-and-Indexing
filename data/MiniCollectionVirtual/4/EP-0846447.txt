<ABSTRACT>
A stent and a method for fabricating the stent are disclosed.
The stent has an originally flat pattern and connection points (38,28)

where the sides of the flat pattern are joined. The method
includes the steps of a) cutting a stent pattern into a flat

piece of metal thereby to produce a metal pattern, b) deforming
the metal pattern so as to cause two opposing sides to meet, and

c) joining the two opposing sides at least at one point.
Substantially no portion of the stent projects into the lumen of

the stent when the stent is expanded against the internal wall of
a blood vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to methods of fabricating stents.Stents are known in the art. They are typically formed of a cylindrical metal mesh
which can expand when pressure is internally applied. Alternatively, they can be
formed of wire wrapped into a cylindrical shape.As described in U.S. 4,776,337 to Palmaz, the cylindrical metal mesh shape is
produced by laser cutting a thin walled metal tube. The laser cuts away all but the
lines and curves of the mesh. The method of U.S. 4,776,337 is applicable for relatively
large mesh shapes and for meshes whose lines are relatively wide. However,
for more delicate and/or intricate shapes, the spot size of the laser is too
large.EP-A-0 709 067 discloses a stent and a method for fabricating the stent. The stent
has an originally flat pattern and connection points where the sides of the flat pattern
are joined. The method includes the steps of cutting a stent pattern into a flat
piece of metal thereby to produce a metal pattern, deforming the metal pattern so
as to cause two opposing sides to meet, and joining the two opposing sides at least
at one point.It is an object of the present invention to provide a stent fabrication method which
can produce stents with relatively intricate and/or delicate designs. This object and other objects are achieved according to the invention by a method
defined in claim 1, a sheet as defined in claim 17 and a stent as defined in claim
24. Advantageous embodiments are depicted in the dependent claims.The method involves first creating a flat version of the desired stent pattern from a
piece of thin sheet metal. The flat pattern can be produced through any suitable
technique, such as etching the design into the sheet metal, or by cutting with a
very fine laser, should one become commercially available or by any other technique.Once the sheet metal has been cut, it is deformed so as to cause its edges to meet.
To create a cylindrical stent from a flat, roughly rectangular metal pattern, the flat
metal is rolled until the edges meet. The locations where edges meet are joined
together, such as by spot welding. Afterwards, the stent is polished, either mechanically
or electrochemically. The present invention will be understood and
appreciated more fully from the following detailed description
taken in conjunction with the drawings in which:
Fig. 1 is a flow chart illustration of the stent
fabrication method of the present invention;Figs. 2A, 2B and 2C are illustrations of three
alternative stent patterns to be etched, in
