<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is disclosed for forming a product 
having a substrate and an overmold material secured thereto, with the 

substrate having a shape substantially as set forth in a predetermined 
design, and further with the product being formed in a molding 

machine that erodes portions of the substrate during a step of 
injecting the overmold material into a molding cavity of the molding 

machine. The method includes the step of providing the substantially 
design-shaped substrate (32a) having a compensation portion (37b) secured 

thereto. The method further includes the step of placing the 
substantially design-shaped substrate (32a) having the 

compensation portion (37b) 
secured thereto into the molding cavity so that the compensation 

portion (37b) is positioned in a path of flow (36) of the overmold 
material during 

the step of injecting the overmold material into the molding cavity. 
Moreover, the method includes the step of injecting the overmold 

material into the molding cavity so that the flow of the overmold 
material contacts and erodes the compensation portion (37b) so as to form 

the product having the substantially design-shaped substrate and the 
overmold material secured thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and 
method for forming a product with a molding machine, and more 
particularly relates to an apparatus and method for forming a product 
with a molding machine wherein the product includes a substrate and 
an overmold material secured thereto. Molding machines are widely used for forming products. Some 
molding machines are adapted to form a product having a substrate 
and an overmold material secured thereto. For example, one molding 
machine which is able to form such a product is a high performance, 
high precision, injection molding machine, FS-SE series, sold by Nissei 
Plastic Industrial Co., Ltd. of Sakaki-machi, Nagano-ken, 389-06, 
Japan. The above molding machine includes a mold having a molding 
cavity. The substrate is first positioned in the molding cavity. Then, 
the overmold material is injected in a molten state into the molding 
cavity so as to form the product. The product is then allowed to cool 
and harden. Thereafter, the product is removed from the mold. One problem which may arise when forming a product with a 
molding machine, such as the molding machine described above, is 
deterioration of the substrate due to the substrate being positioned in 
the flow path of the molten overmold material during the step of 
injecting the overmold material into the molding cavity. During such 
overmold material injecting step, the flow of molten overmold material  
 
may contact a portion of the substrate material so as to undesirably 
erode the substrate. It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus 
and method for forming a product with a molding machine with the 
product including a substrate and an overmold material secured 
thereto, wherein the substrate is not negatively affected during the 
step of injecting the molten overmold material into the molding cavity 
of the molding machine. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is 
provided a method of forming a product incorporating a substrate of a 
predetermined desired design with an overmold material secured 
thereto, the product being formed in a molding machine having a 
molding cavity, the method being characterized by the steps of: 
providing the substrate with a compensation portion projecting beyond 
the desired design, placing the substrate into the molding cavity so 
that the compensation portion is positioned in a path of flow of the 
overmold material during injection of the overmold material into the 
molding cavity; and
