<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to needle forming
devices. More particularly, the invention relates to a
cartridge fed multistation needle forming apparatus for
transferring a plurality of needle blanks from a needle grinding
cartridge to a shuttle member and thereafter flat pressing,
curving and side pressing the needle blanks, to form curved
rectangular bodied needles. The apparatus is also capable of
transporting the needle blanks from the shuttle member to a
curving station.The production of needles involves many processes and
different types of machinery in order to prepare quality needles
from raw stock. These varying processes and machinery become
more critical in the preparation of surgical needles where the
environment of intended use is in humans or animals. Some of
the processes involved in the production of surgical grade
needles include, straightening spooled wire stock; cutting
needle blanks from raw stock; tapering or grinding points on one
end of the blank; providing a bore for receiving suture thread
at the other end of the blank; and imparting flat surfaces on
opposite sides of the blank by flat pressing a portion of the
needle blank to facilitate grasping by surgical instrumentation
and curving the needle where curved needles are desired.
Additional processing may be done to impart flat surfaces
substantially perpendicular to the flat pressed portions of the 
needle blank by side pressing a portion of the needle blank to
further facilitate grasping by surgical instrumentation and
insertion into humans or animals.Conventional needle processing is, in large part, a
labor intensive operation requiring highly skilled labor.
Generally, extreme care must be taken to ensure that only the
intended working of the needle is performed and the other parts
of the needle remain undisturbed.Curved rectangular bodied needles have advantages over
other needle configurations in many surgical procedures for a
variety of reasons including, uniformity of entry depth for
multiple sutures and proper "bite" of tissue surrounding the
incision or wound. When providing curved rectangular bodied
needles for surgical procedures it is desirable for the needles
to have a specified rectangular cross-section and a specified
curvature, i.e., a predetermined radius of curvature. The
desired cross-section and radius of curvature for the finished
needle varies with specific applications.Conventional methods of forming curved rectangular
bodied needles require several separate and distinct operations
on various machinery.
