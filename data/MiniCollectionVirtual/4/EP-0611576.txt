<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a medical tool the surface 
of which is enabled to acquire lasting lubricity (low 

friction) by assuming a state wetted with bodily fluid or 
aqueous solution. This surface is formed without requiring 

the coating work to be repeated. The medical tool is 
produced by coating a water-swellable polymer having in the 

molecular unit thereof a reactive functional group capable 
of being reacted with a proton-donating group, on the 

surface of a matrix material possessing the proton-donating 
group, and also by coating a water-swellable polymer having 

in the molecular unit thereof a reactive group capable of 
being reacted with an acid anhydride group on the surface of 

a matrix material possessing the acid anhydride group.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a medical tool and a 
method for the production thereof. More particularly, it 
relates to a medical tool which, owing to a polymer 
deposited on the surface thereof, manifests excellent 
lubricity on being wetted and a method for the production of 
the medical tool. Generally, for the manufacture of catheters and 
other similar medical tools, substances of low friction are 
adopted as matrix materials thereof and further such matrix 
materials are coated with a hydrophilic polymer for the sake 
of precluding the medical tools from inflicting damage on 
the inner wall surfaces of blood vessels or on the tissues 
and enhancing the operability of the medical tools. For 
example, fluorine resin, polyethylene resin, etc. are used 
as substances of low friction for matrix materials and these 
matrix materials are coated with fluorine resin, silicone 
oil, olive oil, glycerol, etc. These measures, however, cannot be expected to 
impart lasting lubricity to the medical tools. The medical 
tools which embody these measures have a problem of poor 
safety in the sense that the lubricious substances are 
liable to exfoliate, peel, or melt from the surfaces of 
matric materials. US-A-4,100,309 makes a disclosure to the effect that 
a copolymer of polyvinyl pyrrolidone with polyurethane is 
used as a substance possessed of lubricity. The method 
taught by this US patent publication is satisfactory in 
terms of lubricity and lastingness of this quality. Since 
this method requires at least two kinds of polymer for 
coating and essentially necessitates the presence of an  
 
isocyanate group as a reactive group on the surface of the 
matrix material, the reaction is not obtainable with either 
a matrix material allowing no easy introduction of the 
isocyanate group or a polymer possessed of lubricity. JP-A-59-81,341 also discloses a method for 
impartation of lubricity similarly by utilizing an 
isocyanate group on the surface of a matric material. Further, JP-B-1-55,023 discloses a method for 
binding a copolymer of polyether, polyamide, or polysiloxane 
through the medium of polyisocyanate to the surface of a 
matrix material of a medical tool. For this method, the 
interposition of the isocyanate is an essential requirement 
and the presence on the surface of the matrix material of at 
least one group selected from among amino group, imino 
group, carboxyl group, and mercapto group is an 
indispensable requirement. This method, therefore, is 
incapable of effecting this binding treatment
