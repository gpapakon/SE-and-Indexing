<ABSTRACT>
A key switch wherein a switching action is effected by 
movements of a keytop (3) movably connected to a holder (5) 

via a scissors-type support linkage (11, 27, 40) which 
consists of first and second links (7, 25, 37, 42, 9, 26, 

44) connected pivotally about a common primary pivot shaft 
(22). 

The keytop, holder and first and second links include 
at least one special secondary pivot shaft (7c, 9c, 9d, 25c, 

26c, 26d, 37c, 46, 48, 52) each carried by a special support 
portion (7f, 9f, 25f, 26f, 37f, 56), and at least one 

special bearing portion (3a, 3b, 5a, 37j, 42a, 44a, 44b) 
each engaging the corresponding special secondary pivot 

shaft. The special support portion and/or the corresponding 
special bearing portion has/have an elastic portion (3c, 5d, 

5d, 9f, 26f, 37f, 42a, 44a, 44b, 56) which elastically 
yields to allow engagement of the special pivot shaft and 

the special bearing portion during assembling of the keytop, 
support linkage and holder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a key
switch provided on a keyboard or data input device used for
a word processor and a personal computer, for example. More
particularly, this invention is concerned with a key switch
which is easy to assemble and which has a high degree of
operating stability.In a conventional key switch, the keytop is
supported vertically movably for a switching action such
that a key stem extending from the underside of the keytop
is slidably supported and guided by a suitable guide portion
formed on a holder plate. The operating stability of the key
switch or keytop is improved by increasing the length of a
guided portion of the key stem at which the key stem is
slidably guided by the guide portion. On the other hand, the
thickness of the keyboard is inevitably increased with an
increase in the length of the guided portion of the key
stem.Recently, personal computers, word processors and
similar electronic devices are required to have reduced size 
and weight for easy carrying or transportation. Keeping pace
with this requirement, there is a growing need for reducing
the thickness of the keyboard used as a data input device
for such electronic devices.The need indicated above may be satisfied by
reducing the length of the guided portion of the key stem.
However, this may lead to easy sticking or sliding
instability of the key stem, and deteriorated operating
stability of the key switch.In view of the drawbacks of the conventional key
switch and the growing need for reduced thickness of the
keyboard, there was proposed a key switch which has a
scissors-type support linkage for movably supporting the
keytop for a switching action, in place of a conventionally
used key stem slidably supported and guided by a holder
plate. An example of such key switch is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 5,280,147.The key switch having such scissors-type support
linkage will be described by reference to Figs. 14-16.As shown in Fig. 14, the key switch includes a
keytop 101 made of a resin material. The Keytop 101 has a
pair of spaced-apart front bearing portions 102 formed at a
front end portion of its underside, and a pair of
spaced-apart rear bearing portions 103 formed at a rear end
portion of the underside. Each of the front bearing portions
102 has a circular engaging hole 104, and each of the rear
bearing portions 103 has an elongated engaging groove 105. 
The key switch further includes a pair of spaced-apart rear
bearing portions 126 formed on a holder plate 125, and a
pair of
