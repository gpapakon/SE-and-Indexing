<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display control circuit and a method for 
controlling a display circuit. In particular, the invention relates to 
controlling displays for portable equipment. Whilst portable equipment such as radio telephones or paging devices are 
becoming increasingly smaller and more versatile, there has been a 
corresponding increase in the number of components used in such 
equipment. In particular, separate memories and display controllers 
occupy a major part of the circuit board and of the volume of such 
portable equipment. The wiring on the circuit boards, which are small in 
surface area, is also complex and multiple conductor layers have to be 
added to the circuit board. Typically, the greatest concentration of data 
transmission, in addition to the reception of signals, is between the 
memory circuits and the display controller. Since the number of conductors should be minimized, circuits provided 
with a communications bus are often chosen. This slows down data 
communications since the bus has to be shared with other devices. 
Frequently circuits having a suitable bus are not available. As the amount 
of data for display increases, the demands placed on display controllers 
have correspondingly increased and it has been necessary to enhance their 
capacity and flexibility. The development of commercial display controllers has concentrated  
 
mainly on providing facilities for large graphical panel displays. A graphic 
display requires larger storage and processing capacity from the controlling 
microcontroller then conventionally available, resulting in greater power 
consumption. Additionally, when using character-based display controllers 
flexible converting of characters is difficult and cannot be equally 
achieved, especially when using a fixed character generator in which the 
desired character set is stored. However, when using character based 
display controllers not nearly as much information needs to be transferred 
via the bus when updating the display. Thus, a simpler, slower and 
cheaper microcontroller can be used. Decreased supply voltages for the control logic have been a problem 
recently since most conventional controllers are intended for use with a 
supply voltage of five volts only. This has accelerated a process to design 
and implement a suitable circuit for portable equipment and paging devices 
in particular. In a first aspect of the invention there is provided a display control circuit 
for portable equipment, comprising a display, a display
