<ABSTRACT>
A thermal spray powder is formed as a mixture of tungsten carbide 
granules and chromium carbide granules. The tungsten carbide 

granules each consists essentially of tungsten carbide bonded 
with cobalt, and the chromium carbide granules each consists 

essentially of chromium carbide bonded with nickel-chromium 
alloy. The powder may be asmixed with self-fluxing alloy powder. 

The powder preferably is sprayed with a high velocity oxygen-fuel 
thermal spray gun.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermal spraying and particularly to a
powder of tungsten carbide and chromium carbide for thermal
spraying.Thermal spraying, also known as flame spraying, involves the
melting or at least heat softening of a heat fusible material
such as metal or ceramic, and propelling the softened material in
particulate form against a surface which is to be coated. The
heated particles strike the surface where they are quenched and
bonded thereto. A thermal spray gun is used for the purpose of
heating and propelling the particles. In one type of thermal
spray gun, the heat fusible material is supplied to the gun in
powder form. Such powders typically comprise small particles,
e.g., between 100 mesh U.S. Standard screen size (149 microns)
and about 2 microns. Heat for powder spraying generally is
provided by a combustion flame or an arc-generated plasma flame.
The carrier gas, which entrains and transports the powder, may be
one of the combustion gases or an inert gas such as nitrogen, or
it may be compressed air.Improved coatings may be produced by spraying at high velocity.
For example, plasma spraying has proven successful for high
velocity in many respects but it can suffer from non-uniform
heating and/or poor particle entrainment which must be effected
by feeding powder laterally into the high velocity plasma stream.High velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) types of powder spray guns 
recently became practical and are typified in U.S. Patent Nos.
4,416,421 and 4,865,252. This type of gun has a combustion
chamber with a high pressure combustion effluent directed through
a nozzle or open channel. Powder is fed into the nozzle chamber
to be heated and propelled by the combustion effluent. Methods
of spraying various materials with high velocity oxygen-fuel guns
are taught in U.S. patent Nos. 4,999,225 and 5,006,321.Another type of thermal spraying is effected with a detonation
gun in which pulses of fuel mixture and powder are injected into
a chamber with a long barrel and detonated. Successive high
velocity bursts of the heated powder are directed to a substrate.
This system is complex, costly and requires an enclosure against
the noise bursts.Wear resistance is a common requirement for thermal sprayed
coatings, and carbide powders are frequently used, for example
tungsten carbide. British patent specification No. 867,455
typifies cobalt bonded tungsten carbide powder admixed with a
sprayweld self-fluxing powder for producing coatings. Often such
coatings are subsequently fused. Self-fluxing

A method for producing a carbide coating utilizing a thermal spray gun
including nozzle member with a nozzle face and a tubular gas cap

extending from the nozzle member, the gas cap having an inwardly facing
cylindrical wall defining a combustion chamber with an open end and an

opposite end bounded by the nozzle face, the method comprising the steps
of:


preparing a substrate for receiving a thermal sprayed coating,
injecting an annular flow of a combustible mixture of a combustion gas and
oxygen from the nozzle coaxially into the combustion chamber at a

pressure therein of at least two bar above atmospheric pressure,
injecting an annular outer flow of pressurized non-combustible gas adjacent
to the cylindrical wall radially outward of the annular flow of the combustible

mixture,
feeding a carbide-containing powder in a carrier gas axially from the nozzle
into the combustion chamber,
injecting an annular inner flow of pressurized gas from the nozzle member
into the combustion chamber coaxially between the combustible mixture

and the powder-carrier gas,
combusting the combustible mixture in the combustion chamber whereby a
supersonic spray stream containing the heat fusible material in finely

divided form is propelled through the open end, and directing the spray
stream toward the substrate so as to produce a coating thereon, wherein
