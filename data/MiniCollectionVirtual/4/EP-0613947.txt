<ABSTRACT>
A mitogenic factor and a gene encoding the mitogenic 
factor include the sequences shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. 

Oligonucleotide capable of hybridizing with the gene can 
be used for the PCR primers. Mitogenic factor gene can be 

detected by the steps of amplifying and accumulating a 
fragment of the mitogenic factor gene by repeating the 

cycles of the PCR using the foregoing oligonucleotides and 
detecting the fragment thus amplified and accumulated. 

Group A streptococci can be detected by the presence of 
the mitogenic factor gene. The present invention makes it 

possible to detect strongly pathogenic group A 
streptococci in an early stage of the infection, and thus 

can be utilized for an early diagnosis of the infectious 
disease with the bacteria.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mitogenic factor, a
gene encoding the mitogenic factor, recombinant vectors
containing said gene and transformed host cells, oligonucleotides
for detecting the gene, a method of microdetection for the
gene, a method of microdetection for group A streptococci,
and antibodies which specifically recognise said factor.The group A streptococci produce a number of
extracellular proteins, among which are included the
erythrogenic toxins. All substances which cause a skin
reaction were originally defined as erythrogenic toxins,
regardless of their biological activity or biochemical
nature. The erythrogenic toxins are also known as scarlet
fever toxin, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (spe),
streptococcal exotoxin, blastogens, and mitogens.Three antigenically distinct erythrogenic toxins have
been described, including type A, B, and C toxins. The
most extensively studied toxin is the type A toxin, which
was originally thought to be the toxin responsible for
scarlet fever. The type A toxin is encoded by the
bacteriophage speA gene and has a molecular weight of
25,787. The type B toxin is encoded by the bacteriophage
speB gene and has a molecular weight of 27,588. The type 
C toxin is encoded by the bacteriophage speC gene and has
a molecular weight of 24,354.The erythrogenic toxins have been associated with a
variety of biological activities, including the following:
erythematous skin reactions, probably due to enhancement
of delayed hypersensitivity; pyrogenicity; specific and
nonspecific T-cell mitogenicity; immunosuppression by
nonspecific activation of T-suppressor lymphocytes;
enhancement of susceptibility to endotoxin shock;
cytotoxicity to splenic macrophages; cardiotoxicity;
alteration of the blood-brain barrier; and alteration of
antibody response to sheep erythrocytes in mice and
rabbits.In view of the fact that at least two of the toxin
genes, speA and speC, are located on mobile genetic
elements, the frequency of occurrence of the erythrogenic
toxin genes in a population of clinical isolates has been
studied. According to these results, the speA gene was
found in 15% of general strains and 45% of strains
obtained from patients with scarlet fever (Yu C.E. and
J.J. Ferreti, Infection and Immunity, 57, 3715 (1989)) and
the speB gene was found in all group A strains tested and
the speC gene was found in 50% of each of the general
strains, isolates from patients with scarlet fever, and
isolates from patients with rheumatic fever(Yu, C.E. et
al., Infection and Immunity,
