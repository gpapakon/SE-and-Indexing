<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a method of compacting foundry mould material by means of a pressurised gas, the mould material being introduced into a moulding device with a pattern plate with a pattern frame and a mould and filling frame, the pressurised gas being used at least for precompaction, the pressure surge used for precompaction being released into the mould cavity with a low and then a higher pressure gradient.

<CLAIMS>
A process for compressing foundry moulding
material, where the moulding material is introduced

into a moulding device with a pattern plate with a
pattern frame and a forming and filling frame arranged

thereon, by means of a compressed gas, the compressed
gas being used at least for preliminary compression,

characterised in that the pressure surge used for
preliminary compression is released with a low and than

with a higher pressure gradient into the moulding
chamber.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in
that the portion of the pressure curve produced with

the higher pressure gradient follows on without
interruption from the low pressure gradient phase.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in
that the pressure increase with a low pressure gradient

is effected in a range of from 0.1 to 10 bar/sec.
A process according to claim 1, characterised in
that the higher pressure gradient is in a range of from

1 to 80 bar/sec.
A process according to claim 4, characterised in
that the higher pressure gradient is in a range of from

1 to 50 bar/sec.
