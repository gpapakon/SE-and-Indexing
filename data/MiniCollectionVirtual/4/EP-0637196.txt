<ABSTRACT>
The process involves: initially gluing a semiconducting crystal (7) at the face bearing the contact surfaces (8) to a polymer 
film (1); arranging and securing the polymer film (1) in a compression mould (13) so as to create a gap (14) between the 

surface of the compression mould (13) and the polymer film (1) along its entire length except in the vicinity of the contact 
surfaces (8); shaping the polymer substrate (23) of the integrated microcircuit; removing the polymer film (1) from the contact 

surfaces (8); heat-treating the substrate (23) and creating electrical connections between the contact surfaces (8) and the 
metal output terminals of the terminal frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor 
devices manufacturing means and specifically to a 
method of manufacture of integrated. There is known a method of the manufacture of semiconductor 
devices consisting in that a semiconductor 
element is installed on an insulating base provided 
with a conducting pattern of connections following 
which, the element and the base are encapsulated. 
The element with its leads welded on to it is bonded 
to the base upon which the external ends of the 
leads are connected to the base pattern elements and 
encapsulated with a plastic material (JP, A, 63-9372). To implement the method, it is necessary first 
to weld the leads onto the crystal and, when fitting 
the crystal in the through channel of the package, to 
form these leads around a plate which is an element 
of the package in its turn. These operations make 
the method complicated and unreliable. Besides, in the 
process of potting the channel with the encapsulating 
polymer, there is a probability of contact of one 
of the electrodes and the crystal edge which will 
result in the device failure. There is also known a method of the manufacture 
of integrated circuits according to which a polyimide 
film is secured on the surface of a metal lead 
frame, and holes corresponding to the bonding pads 
of the crystal are made in the film using the photolithography 
method. The crystal is bonded to the 
film referring to the above-mentioned holes and its 
edge, in so doing, is protected with the film. This 
done, the electrical connections of the crystals  
 
bonding pads and lead frame terminals are formed and 
the crystal jointly with the lead frame and film are 
moulded thus forming an integrated circuit substrate 
(JP, A, 57-55310). The photolithography operation and also the 
operation of etching holes in the film make the 
described method rather complicated in implementation 
and do not ensure a high output of serviceable 
articles. Besides, the connections of the film and 
crystal inside the holes are not sufficiently reliable 
which also negatively tells on the output of the 
serviceable articles. The principal object of this invention is to 
provide a method of manufacture of integrated circuits 
which would allow increasing the output of serviceable 
articles and improving their reliability by creating 
conditions excluding the breaks of conductors in the 
process of encapsulation. The foregoing object is attained by a method of 
manufacture of integrated circuits consisting in that 
a semiconductor
