<ABSTRACT>
A control apparatus having a continuously variable adjusting element (6) for power control has a signalling device (30) in order to make it possible to sense, via the operating handle and using snap-pulse signals, how large the adjusting movement which has been carried out is. In addition to the latched off position and limit positions which are directly adjacent to it on both sides for the minimum and maximum power output, another four further signal positions are provided which, with the limit positions, are distributed uniformly over the remaining adjustment movement, continuously variable very fine adjustments also being possible in their region and each setting thus reached essentially being self-locking.

A control apparatus, more particularly a power
control apparatus (1) for electrical heaters, including

a base body (2), with regard to which a positioning
member (6) actuatable over a positioning travel and

intermediate positions in a positioning direction
against the moment of resistance of a snap-action means

(30) is movably mounted, said snap-action means (30)
comprising working members (31, 32) interengaging in

each intermediate position, one of which comprises snap-action
flanks (41, 42; 43, 38; 44, 38) having flank

sections ensuring in common the intermediate position
and dictating slope angles, characterized in that said

flank sections of said two snap-action flanks (41, 42;
43, 38; 44, 38) assuring said intermediate position

comprise differing gradients.
The control apparatus as set forth in claim 1,
characterized in that said manually actuatable

positioning member (6) is substantially infinitely
variable in opposing directions as well as at least over

a partial travel and said snap-action means (30) is
provided as the signal generator of a signalling means

for signalling said intermediate positions of said
positioning member (6) substantially without a scale by

positioning signals, more particularly several snap-action
members (34 to 36) being configured for

outputting position signals distinguishable from each
other and preferably said snap-action members (34 to 36)

being configured for outputting tactile position signals
at an operator control (11) by a sudden change in said

actuating moment of resistance acting against said
actuation of said positioning member (6).
The control apparatus as set forth in claim 2,
characterized in that said snap-action members (34 to 

36) are configured so that said positioning signal
results in a reduction in said moment of resistance when

said positioning member (6) approaches one of said

intermediate positions or an increase in said moment of
resistance when said positioning member (6) leaves an

intermediate position, more particularly as regards at
least one intermediate position said change in said

moment of resistance corresponding to maximally two to
four times and preferably said snap-action means (30)

presenting said positioning member (6) in at least one
intermediate position a more or less equal moment of

resistance in both opposing positioning directions.
The control apparatus as set forth in any of said
preceding claims, characterized in that said snap-action

means (30) as a latching means assures at least one
intermediate position of said positioning member (6)

self-centering, more particularly said snap-action
members (32, 34 to 36), such as recesses on a control

curve (31) as well as a follower (32) guided thereon are
urged into interengagement by spring pressure, and

preferably said follower (32) is provided on a working
member (50) for actuating at least one pair of contacts

(23, 24), said follower (32) being movable in one of its
latched intermediate positions relative to another of

its intermediate positions against a greater moment of
resistance.
The control apparatus as set forth in claim 4,
characterized in that said working member (50) carrying

said follower (32) mounts a movable contact of said
contact pair (23) and is configured as a spring, arm, or

the like, more particularly said follower (32) being
configured integrally with said corresponding working

member (50), and preferably for controlling the power at
a positioning lever (51) a positioning element (13)

engaging said positioning member (6) being provided, 
said positioning element (14) surrounding said working

member (50) without contact.
The control apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said snap-action

member (34 to 36) of said snap-action means (30) mounted
manually rotatable on said base body (2) comprises an

inclined assembly surface area (48) for guiding-in said
snap-action member (32) engaging it, more particularly

said guide-in surface area (48) being formed by a
substantially continual elongation of said snap-action

flanks (41, 42) for a position of said snap-action means
(30) associated with the OFF position of said control

apparatus (1) and preferably said guide-in surface area
(48) being offset in said positioning direction relative

to at least one further snap-action member (34, 36) of
said snap-action means (30).
The control apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said snap-action

member (6) comprises adjacent to said adjoining snap-action
member (34 to 36) a positioning element (13) for

substantially infinitely variable power control, between
which and said snap-action member (34 to 36) an

intermediate section (52) is provided, more particularly
said positioning member (6) being configured as a

positioning shaft to be connected to said operator
control (11) and preferably said positioning member (6)

consisting of a non-metallic material and forming two
journals (7, 8), said snap-action member (34 to 36)

directly adjoining one journal (7) and said positioning
element (13) directly adjoining the other journal (8).
The control apparatus as set forth in claim 7,
characterized in that said positioning element (13 ) is

located nearer to said operator control (11) than said
snap-action member (34 to 36), more particularly said 

guide-in surface area (48) as viewed axially being
exposed at one end of said positioning member (6) and

preferably a coupling member (12) for a connecting shaft
protruding beyond said floating journal (7) facing away

from said operator control (11).
The control apparatus as set forth in any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said snap-action

flanks (41, 42) are recess flanks provided at cam humps
(39, 40) translating via near acutely angled hump crests

(45, 46) of said cam humps (39, 40) into further snap-action
