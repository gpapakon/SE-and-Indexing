<ABSTRACT>
A porous multi-layer film favorably employable as a 
separator film for a nonaqueous electric battery comprises 

at least three united polyolefin layers, in which at 
least one polyolefin layer is a polyethylene layer and at 

least one polyolefin layer is a polypropylene layer which 
is placed in contact with the polyethylene layer. The 

polyolefin layers are combined to form a united structure 
with a peel strength of at least 3 g/15 mm and has a pore 

volume of 30-80%, a maximum pore size of 0.02-2 µm, a 
shutdown temperature of 135-140°C, and a thermal durability 

to maintain the shutdown condition up to at least 
180°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a porous multi-layer
film having uniform micropores. In particular, the
invention relates to a porous multi-layer film which is
favorably employable as a battery separator to be incorporated
in batteries such as a lithium battery.Porous plastic films are employable in various
fields of art. For instance, a porous plastic film is
employed as a battery separator in nonaqueous batteries
such as a lithium battery (i.e., lithium cell), a separator
in electrolytic condensers, an insulator in electronic
devices, an artificial lung diaphragm, a plasma purifier,
respiratory clinical clothing, a filter for separating
microorganisms and virus from water, a separator
for gaseous mixtures, or a filter in air-conditioner.Heretofore, most of porous plastic films comprise a
single ply porous film. The single ply porous film is
easily prepared, but is not satisfactory in its characteristics
in certain fields. For instance, it is now
understood that a singly ply porous film cannot satisfy
the enhanced requirements for battery separators of nonaqueous
batteries, especially, a lithium battery.In a battery such as a nonaqueous battery, a separator
is placed to obviate production of short circuit
between a positive electrode and a negative electrode.
As the nonaqueous battery, a lithium battery (i.e., lithium
secondary cell) has been paid specific attention and
studied widely. The lithium battery comprises a negative 
electrode of metallic lithium, an alloy of lithium and
other metal, an organic material such as carbon or graphite
which is adsorbable of lithium ion or storable of
lithium ion by intercalation, an electroconductive polymer
doped with lithium ion, or the like; a positive electrode
of a fluorinated graphite represented by (CFx)n, a
metal oxide such as MnO2, V2O5, CuO, Ag2CrO4 or TiO2, a
sulfide, or a chloride; and a nonaqueous electrolyte
solution comprising an electrolyte such as LiPF6, LiBF4,
LiClO4 or LiCF3SO3 in an organic solvent such as ethylene
carbonate, propylene carbonate, γ-butyrolactone, acetonitrile,
1,2-dimethoxyethane or tetrahydrofuran.It is known that lithium is very reactive. Accordingly,
if an abnormal electric current flows in the lithium
battery due to production of external short circuit
or erroneous connection, the temperature of the battery
extremely increases and causes thermal damage in a device
equipped with that lithium battery. In order to obviate
such troubles, a battery separator (also called simply
"separator") is placed between the positive and
