<ABSTRACT>
A device for applying a mechanical tension to a tape loaded into a cassette, in particular a fast-running tape, which is to be unwound from a first reel (spool) and wound up onto a second reel, the reels respectively lying on a reel hub, and the tape being passed around at least two deflecting rollers, between which it runs substantially in a straight line, is characterised in that at least one device for mechanically preloading the tape with variable force is provided at least in the region of one of the deflecting rollers and the reel hub lying closest to it in terms of tape running.

<CLAIMS>
Device for applying a mechanical tension onto a tape inserted into a cartridge, wherein
said cartridge is used in streamers and similar applications, i
n which a fast running tape is
required, wherein tape reels are each placed on one reel hub, wherein said tape is to be

wound off a first reel and to be wound on a second reel and is guided around at least two
deflection rollers, between which it is running substantially linearly, and wherein the tape

drive is provided by an endless belt, which operates on sections of said tape wound on
said reels, characterized in that at least in the region of one of said deflection rollers (32,

34) and of said reel hub (24, 26) being closest according to the tape run at least one device
(50, 70; 90, 92, 96) for a spring loading of said tape is provided.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said device for spring loading said tape
is a spring loaded clip (52, 72), which is swivelling around an axis parallel to said reel hub

(24, 26) and whose distal end (54, 74) can be put against said tape.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that said clip (52) is straight.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that said clip (72) takes an arcuate course
from its swivelling axis (76) to its distal end (74).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that said device for spring loading said tape
is a spring loaded pin (90), which is movable along a determinable path (92) and whose

longitudinal axis is oriented substantially parallel to said reel hub (24, 26).
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that said pin (90) is guided within an elongated
hole (92).
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that said device for spring
loading said tape comprises a spiral spring (60, 80, 96).
