<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for detecting the presence of a paging signal at 57 KHz in a frequency 
modulated transmission includes a phase locked loop (14) which is sensitive to the 

presence of a pager signal. The phase locked loop (14) which produces phase adjusting 
pulses at a repetition rate representative of the presence or absence of a pager signal. The 

phase adjusting pulses are fed to a detector (22) which produces a bistable signal which is 
either low, indicating no pager signal, or high, indicating the presence of a pager signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for detecting the presence of a pager signal in a
frequency modulated (FM) radio transmission.The FM radio frequency band typically extends from about 87 to 104 MHz. Within this
band there are a plurality of channels, each carrying a stereo multiplexed signal or mono
signal, to which is sometimes added a pager signal transmitted on a sub-carrier at a
predetermined frequency. Typically, this predetermined frequency is 57 KHz, being phase
locked to the third harmonic of the 19 KHz pilot tone of the stereophonic multiplex signal.When a known receiver is scanning the channels for a paging signal, it detects the audio
signal (music, speech etc) and then checks for the existence of a pager signal at 57 KHz.
The receiver thus scans through every channel transmitting an audio signal and checks for
the existence of a pager signal. This takes a substantial time because a pager signal is not
transmitted on all channels. For example, WO 85/03824 discloses a radio frequency
communications system having a plurality of radio transmitters capable of broadcasting a
pilot signal representative of a paging signal. A receiver is repeatedly retuned until a pilot
signal is detected from a particular transmitter, so the receiver scans through every
channel to check for the existence of a pilot signal. The invention aims to provide
apparatus which speeds up the location of pager signals in a frequency modulated radio
transmission.According to the invention there is provided apparatus for detecting the presence of a
pager signal at a predetermined frequency in a frequency modulated transmission having
a plurality of channels, comprising circuitry including a phase locked loop tuned to the
predetermined frequency so as to be sensitive to the presence of the pager signal, and a
detector responsive to the circuitry for detecting the presence of the pager signal, 
characterised in that the phase locked loop is sensitive to the presence of the paper signal
in any of the plurality of channels of the transmission without the need for each channel
to be checked in turn for the presence or absence of the pager signal, and in that the phase
locked loop is operative to produce an output signal consisting of a stream of pulses at a
pulse repetition frequency representative of the presence or absence of the pager signal,
said output signal being fed to the detector which is operative to detect the number of
pulses produced in a predetermined time. The detector may comprise a comparator and a
counter, the
