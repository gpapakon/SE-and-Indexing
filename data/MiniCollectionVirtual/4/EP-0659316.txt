<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cellular radio network and a mobile radio station. At least part of the mobile stations (MS) are capable of moving, except in a primary network, in at least one other network (BCPN1-2, DCPN1-2) having a location area configuration different from that of the primary network. By means of the invention, the user may prevent manually all location updatings and location updating attempts between the different networks and thus temporarily "lock" the use of the mobile station within a particular network. Not even a location updating attempt into a "foreign network" is made. It is up to the user of the mobile station (MS) to decide when he activates the registration function. The locking function remains activated until deactivation by the user. Subsequent to the deactivation, location updatings between the networks are performed in a normal manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cellular radio network
and especially to an improved location updating
in cellular networks.Base stations of a cellular radio network
broadcast information of themselves and their environment
continuously. Such network configuration information
may contain for instance a location area
identifier, a base station identifier, a base station
type identifier and a so-called neighbouring cell
information. When being currently registered to a
base station of a particular cell, a mobile station
also monitors the quality of the transmission of the
base stations indicated by the neighbouring cell information
of the current base station and moves to
some of these base stations, if the field strength of
the present base station becomes lower. The cellular
network knows the location of the mobile station usually
with an accuracy of a so-called location area,
to which belongs a suitable number of predetermined
cells with their base stations. The location area
information sent by the base station indicates to the
mobile station to which location area the base station
belongs. When the mobile station moves to another
cell within the same location area, no location
updating is needed in the cellular network. On the
other hand, upon observing on the basis of location
area information a change of location area when moving
to a coverage area of a new base station, the
mobile station initiates a location updating by sending
a location updating request to the cellular network. 
As a consequence of this location updating request,
the cellular network stores the new location
area of the mobile station in subscriber registers.EP-A-0439628 discloses a method for a position
registration of the mobile unit. The border areas of the
position registration areas are overlapping so that each
base station belongs to more than one registration area.
Each of the base stations transmits all the position
registration codes. The mobile unit selects the area code
so that the position of the mobile unit is located at the
centre of the area selected, in order to reduce the number
of registrations in the border area of the registration
areas.In future, it is conceivable that both public
cellular networks maintained by different operators
and several kinds of private Customer Premises Networks
(CPN) are utilized, such as for instance Business
Customer Premises Networks (BCPN), Domestic Customer
Premises Networks (DCPN) and Mobile Customer
Premises Networks (MCPN). In such a situation, it
would be preferable for the
