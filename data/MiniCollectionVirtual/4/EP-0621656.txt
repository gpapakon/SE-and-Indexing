<CLAIMS>
Electrical terminal device with a housing (1) made from insulating
material which has at least one lead-in slot (11, 11a) for an electrical lead, this

slot being open at the edge towards the lead-in side, and at least one cuffing and
clamping contact disposed in the housing and forming a contacting zone with a

cutting and clamping slot (15) which is open at the edge and aligned with the
lead-in slot for conductor connection, in which


the cutting and clamping contact is constructed on a contact spring (17,
17a) which has at least one additional plug contact (27, 28; 27a) and a

contact (29, 70a, 71a) for an equipment connection,
a groove-like recess (20, 21; 20a, 21a) is constructed in a housing part
which accommodates the cutting and clamping slot (15, 15a), adjoining

the lead-in slot (11, 11a) on at least one side, the dimensions of this
recess in terms of length, depth and width being such that a connecting

lead contained therein is received in a shockproof manner,
at least one chamber (24, 24a) is disposed in the housing below the
housing part containing the cutting and clamping slot and is constructed

with a lead-in opening on one side of the housing for a connector (52),
the chamber (24, 24a) is traversed by the contact spring (17) and
contains the additional plug contact (27, 28; 27a), and 
the equipment connection contact is either constructed as a plug contact
(29) with an opposing lead-in direction to the additional plug contact (27,

28; 27a) for a connector (50) and a lead-in is associated with it which
opens on the side of the housing opposite the lead-in (36) of the

additional plug contact, or the equipment connection contact has at least
one base pin (70a, 71a) projecting out of the housing.
Terminal device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the plug
contact (27, 28; 27a) and/or the equipment connection contact (29, 70a) are

constructed on a planar part of the contact spring (17, 17a) containing the
cutting and clamping slot (15, 15a).
Terminal device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the plug
contact (27, 28; 27a) is constructed with a releasable conductor connection.
Terminal device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
din that the equipment connection contact (29, 70a 71a) is set up for non-releasable

connection of a connector of the equipment (6, 6a).
Terminal device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the plug contact (27, 28, 27a) is formed by free-cut flaps in the contact

spring (17, 17a) which spread apart when the connector is inserted and with
which an unlocking zone accessible from the outside of the equipment with a

releasing tool is optionally associated, and that in this case the flaps are
constructed so as to be resiliently deformable by a pressing force acting in the

unlocking zone on the contact spring in the release direction. 
Terminal device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the contact spring (17) is a flat spring.
Terminal contact device as claimed in one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the contact spring (17, 17a) is bent round in the region of

the cuffing and clamping slot (15, 15a) by 180Â°.
Terminal device as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that the housing
has at least two chambers (24, 25) disposed one above the other which are

traversed by the contact spring (17) and of which one chamber (24) contains the
plug contact (27, 28) and the other chamber contains the equipment connection

contact (29), and that both chambers (24, 25) are constructed with associated
lead-ins for connectors (50, 52).
Terminal device as claimed in Claim 8, characterised in that the two
chambers (24, 25) are disposed below the housing part containing the cutting

and clamping contact.
Terminal device as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in that the contact

spring (17, 17a) is supported in the housing (1; 1a, b) against a force acting on
the cutting and clamping slot (15, 15a) in the longitudinal direction of the

contact spring. 
Terminal device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the contact spring (17, 17a) is supported in the region of the plug contact

(27, 28; 27a) against the direction of a force exerted by a releasing tool.
Terminal device as claimed in Claims 8 and 11, characterised in that the
support is constructed at locally defined support points (40) on the walls of the

chamber (25).
Terminal device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that lateral guide means for the contact spring (17, 17a) which pass through

on both sides are constructed in the housing part containing the cutting and
clamping slot (15, 15a) and in at least one chamber (24, 24a) disposed below it.
Terminal device as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that a transversely extending opening (3) to receive a fixing means (7) on the
