<ABSTRACT>
For the signal to have the least possible influence on the reference potential, it is provided in a "Rail to Rail" amplifier arrangement that the latter has a first differential amplifier which has a first and a second transistor, the emitters of which are coupled to a reference potential via a common first resistor, the collector of the first transistor forming the output node of the amplifier arrangement, a second differential amplifier which is supplied at the input end with the input signal of the amplifier arrangement and the output end of which is coupled to the base of the first transistor of the first differential amplifier and which has an inverting input which is coupled to the output node of the amplifier arrangement, a first current balancing arrangement, the input transistor of which is supplied with a reference current, the output transistor of which is identical with the second transistor of the first differential amplifier and the two transistors of which are coupled to a reference potential at the emitter end, and a second current balancing arrangement which is supplied at the input end with the output signal of the first current balancing arrangement, which is coupled at the output end to the output node of the amplifier arrangement, the two transistors of which are coupled at the emitter end to a supplier potential and the transistors of which are designed with respect to their area ratios in such a manner that the current balancing arrangement supplies at the output end a current which has twice the magnitude of the input current supplied to it.
