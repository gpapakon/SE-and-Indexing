<ABSTRACT>
Drug delivery systems have been developed based on the formation of diketopiperazine (or analogs) microparticles. In the preferred embodiment the microparticle is stable at low pH and disintegrates at physiological pH, and is particularly useful for oral drug delivery. In the most preferred embodiment the microparticles are formed in the presence of the drug to be delivered, for example, insulin or heparin. The diketopiperazine synthetic intermediates are preferably formed by cyclodimerization to form diketopiperazine derivatives at elevated conditions under dehydrating conditions, then precipitated with drug to be incorporated into microparticles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally in the area of drug 
delivery systems and is particularly related to 
reversible microencapsulation of drugs by certain 2,5-diketo-derivatives 
of piperazine. Delivery of drugs has been a major problem for 
many years. It is particularly a problem when the 
compound to be delivered is unstable under the 
conditions encountered when administered to the 
patient, prior to reaching its targeted location. For 
example, it is preferable in many cases to administer 
drugs orally, especially in terms of ease of 
administration, patient compliance, and decreased 
cost. However, many compounds are ineffective or 
exhibit low or variable potency when administered 
orally. Presumably this is because the drugs are 
unstable to conditions in the digestive tract or 
because they are inefficiently absorbed. The field of oral drug delivery covers a broad 
range of delivery systems ranging from simple 
mechanical carriers such as pressed tablets which 
transport compounds that can be safely and efficiently 
delivered through the stomach, to enteric coatings 
which delay the release of the encapsulated compound 
to later in the digestive process and lower in the 
gastrointestinal tract. 
A variety of enteric coatings have been used to 
encapsulate and protect the drug prior to reaching the 
small intestine. In some cases these are effective. 
However, there are drugs that are also unstable to the 
conditions present in the small intestine and 
therefore must be administered in much higher dosages 
if the drug is to be released in the small intestine 
for an effective amount to penetrate to the 
bloodstream. In these cases, it is necessary to have 
a mechanism whereby the coating is not only stable to 
the conditions present in the digestive tract, as well  
 
as to the conditions under which it is stored prior to 
administration to the patient, but which allows the 
encapsulated drug to pass into the bloodstream. Other factors in drug delivery system design 
include the requirements that the system must be non-toxic, 
non-reactive with the drug to be delivered, not 
too expensive or difficult to manufacture, formed of 
readily available components, and consistent with 
respect to final composition and physical 
characteristics, including stability and release rate. 
The system must also be formed of materials that are 
easily removed by normal metabolic processes. A number of different systems have been 
proposed, most based on peptides or biodegradable 
natural or synthetic polymers, such as
