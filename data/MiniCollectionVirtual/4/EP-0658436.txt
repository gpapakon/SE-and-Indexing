<ABSTRACT>
A non photographic method for making patterns in 
organic films comprising the sequential step: 


a) applying in predetermined pattern an imaging 
layer (40) comprising an agent which is capable of changing 

the solubility of a solid organic polymer in at least 
one unpatterned layer (39) laying in contact with solid 

imaging layer to form the compiled body on a substrate 
by screen printing with a screen (41) having a plurality of 

apertures of polygon of which each side is recessed, 
b) drying the unpatterned layer fully or 
partially at a predetermined temperature to diffuse 

said solubility change agent from the imaging layer to 
the unpatterned dielectric layer(s) and 
c) removing the patterned imaging layer and the 
diffusion patterned areas of the unpatterned layer(s) 

which are both soluble in a predetermined eluant, by 
washing said compiled body with the predetermined 

eluant. 
Additionally, the following step d can be used to 

substitute step a above and combined with steps b and 
c to make fine channel type patterns in organic films: 
d) applying in predetermined pattern an imaging 
layer comprising an agent which is capable of changing 

the solubility of a solid organic polymer in at least 
one unpatterned dielectric layer laying in contact 

with solid imaging layer to form the compiled body on 
a substrate by screen printing with a screen having a 

plurality of grouped apertures comprising of 
relatively smaller size apertures with predetermined 

spacing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a diffusion
patterning process for organic polymer films. More
specifically, it is directed to (1) an improved
emulsion opening design of screen (for screen
printing) suitable for producing straight edge
features of screen printed diffusion patterning paste
and (2) a grouped aperture design of the screen
suitable for producing fine channels by the above
process.Multilayer thick film circuits have been used for
many years to increase circuit functionality per unit
area. Conventionally thick film materials are
deposited onto substrates by printing through screens
having a desired pattern. One major problem
associated with patterning thick film in multilayer
configuration is the limited resolution capability by
screen printing. In addition, this multilayer
approach requires excessive printing and firing steps
which adversely affects the mass-productivity and is
more expensive. Repeating the printing and firing
steps limits the resolution of patterns, and also
requires stringent control of thickness for each
layer, realignment between the layers and careful
processes to avoid blistering and cracking.A diffusion patterning process as disclosed by
Felton in U.S. patent 5, 032, 216 can overcome these
drawbacks.In this method, a first layer of non
photosensitive polymeric material is applied to a
substrate in an unpatterned manner, followed by a
second non photosensitive layer with a pattern. 
Agent(s) from the second patterning layer diffuses
downward into the first layer effecting a change in
the dispersibility of that layer. The second layer
and those areas having greater dispersibility in the
first layer by the above action are then removed by
washing with a predetermined eluant. For electronic
applications, the functional material is contained in
the first layer, which is fired after the washing
step. As screen printing is pertinent to this
invention and has been one of the most commonly used
thick film application methods, a brief summary
is provided below.The screen is one of the most important part of
the screen printing equipment. It is responsible for
the definition of the printed pattern and is also the
major factor controlling the thickness of thick film
paste deposited on the substrate surface. During the
printing process the squeegee forces paste through the
open areas of the screen and at the same time presses
the screen into close contact with the substrate, so
forming a seal which minimizes sideways spread of the
paste between the face of the screen and the
substrate

A non-photographic method for making patterns in organic
films comprising the sequential steps:


(a) applying a patterned imaging layer comprising an agent
which is capable of changing the solubility of a solid,

non-cristalline, film-forming organic polymer in at least
one unpatterned layer being in contact with said imaging

layer to form a compiled body on a substrate by screen

apertures of which each side is recessed,
(b) drying the imaging layer to diffuse said solubility
change agent from the imaging layer to the unpatterned

layer(s), and
(c) removing the patterned imaging layer and the diffusion
patterned areas of the unpatterned layer(s) which are both

soluble in an eluant, by washing said compiled body with
the eluant.

at least two imaging layers, the apertures for screen

printing each imaging layer being smaller than those
provided for the underlying imaging layer.
