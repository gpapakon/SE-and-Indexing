<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to image sensor devices and more particularly
an active transistor charge detection device.Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is described in
connection with charge coupled device (CCD) image sensors, as an example.
Essential to good low noise performance of a CCD image sensor is the charge
detection amplifier which converts charge stored at an individual photosite into a
signal of adequate magnitude for further processing.The most popular charge detection concept in CCD sensors is based on a
floating diffusion circuit. A typical prior art charge detection amplifier consists of a
floating diffusion detection node and an amplifier circuit. See Hynecek, J., "Method
of Making Top Buss Virtual Phase Frame Interline Transfer CCD Image Sensor",
U.S. Patent 5,151,380, issued Sep. 29, 1992. The charge detection node is a
conventional gated floating diffusion structure typically used with virtual phase CCDs
and has an externally driven reset gate.GB Patent 1 457 253 discloses a semiconductor charge
transfer device having a plurality of field effect
transistor structures each having a channel region located
in a portion of the semiconductor body which underlies a
conductive layer forming part of a storage means in which
portion a current flow of charge carriers in the transistor
channel can be caused to occur without mixing of said
carriers with charge carriers temporarily stored within the
associated storage means, the magnitude of the current flow
being dependent upon the quantity of charge in the
associated storage means, and source and drain connections
to the semiconductor body located such that an instantaneous
output indicative of the charge stored in the storage means
associated with one or more of said field effect transistor
structures can be obtained by applying an appropriate
potential between the source and drain connections
associated with said one or more transistor structures.US Patent 4,074,302 discloses a semiconductor charge
transfer device which includes a means for enabling the
reading of information present at least in one storage site
comprising an insulated gate field effect transistor
structure having its channel region present at the surface
of the semiconductor layer above said one storage site
and between source and drain regions of the opposite
conductivity type, and means for enabling the temporary
confinement of the quantity of majority charge carriers in
said one storage site to the interior of the layer without
mixing of
