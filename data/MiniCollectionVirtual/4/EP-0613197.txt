<ABSTRACT>
A carbonaceous electrode having improved 
capacities of doping and dedoping a cell active 

substance, such as lithium, and suitable for a non-aqueous 
solvent-type secondary battery, is constituted 

by a carbonaceous material having a specific 
microtexture. The carbonaceous material is 

characterized by having an average (002)-plane spacing 
of at least 0.365 nm according to X-ray diffraction 

method, and by providing a residual carbonaceous 
substance showing an average (002) plane-spacing of at 

most 0.350 nm according to X-ray diffraction method 
when the carbonaceous material is treated with an H₂O-N₂ 

equi-molar gaseous mixture at 900 °C up to a weight 
reduction of 60 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
carbonaceous electrode material for a secondary
battery and more particularly to a carbonaceous
material suitable as an electrode material for a high-energy
density non-aqueous solvent-type secondary
battery because of a high effective utilization rate
represented by a large capacity for doping-dedoping
(elimination) of a cell active substance and an
excellent charge-discharge cycle characteristic. The
present invention also relates to an electrode
structure comprising such a carbonaceous electrode
material, and a non-aqueous solvent-type secondary
battery having such an electrode structure.There has been proposed a non-aqueous
solvent-type lithium (Li) secondary battery having a
negative electrode comprising a carbonaceous material
as a secondary battery of a high energy density (e.g.,
in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (JP-A) 57-208079,
JP-A 62-90863, JP-A 62-122066 and JP-A 2-66856).
This is based on utilization of a phenomenon
that a carbon intercalation compound of lithium can be
easily formed electrochemically. The battery
comprises a negative electrode of such a carbonaceous 
material and a positive electrode of a lithium
chalcogenide, such as LiCoO2. When the battery (cell)
is charged, lithium ions are released from the
positive electrode, flow to the negative electrode and
dope (i.e., are intercalated between layers of) the
carbon of the negative electrode The carbon thus doped
with lithium functions as a lithium electrode. During
the discharge, the lithium ions are de-doped
(released) from the carbon negative electrode and
return to the positive electrode.In such a carbonaceous material as a negative
electrode material or also a carbonaceous material as
a positive electrode material which is doped with a
lithium source, an amount of electricity stored per unit
weight of the carbonaceous material is determined by
the de-doped amount of lithium so that it is desired
for a carbonaceous material constituting an electrode
material to have a large lithium-dedoping capacity.A conventional carbonaceous material obtained
by calcining phenolic resin or furan resin has been
known to have a large lithium-doping capacity and be
desirable from the viewpoint. However, in case where
such a carbonaceous material obtained by calcining
phenolic resin or furan resin is used to constitute a
negative electrode, lithium doping the negative
electrode carbon is not completely de-doped but a
large amount of lithium can remain in the negative 
electrode carbon, so that the active
