<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to new delta-17 and delta-20 
olefinic and saturated 17β-substituted 4-aza-5α-androstan-3-ones and 
related compounds and the use of such compounds as 5α-reductase 
inhibitors. The art reveals that certain undesirable physiological 
manifestations, such as acne vulgaris, seborrhea, female hirsutism, male 
pattern baldness and benign prostatic hyperplasia, are the result of 
hyperandrogenic stimulation caused by an excessive accumulation of 
testosterone or similar androgenic hormones in the metabolic system. 
Early attempts to provide a chemotherapeutic agent to counter the 
undesirable results of hyperandrogenicity resulted in the discovery of 
several steroidal antiandrogens having undesirable hormonal activities 
of their own. The estrogens, for example, not only counteract the effect 
of the androgens but have a feminizing effect as well. Non-steroidal 
antiandrogens have also been developed, for example, 4'-nitro-3'-trifluoromethyl-isobutyranilide. 
See Neri, et al., Endo., Vol. 91. No. 2 
(1972). However, these products, though devoid of hormonal effects, 
are peripherally active, competing with the natural androgens for 
receptor sites, and hence have a tendency to feminize a male host or the 
male fetus of a female host. It is now known in the art that the principal mediator of 
androgenic activity in some target organs, e.g. the prostate, is 5α-dihydrotestosterone, 
and that it is formed locally in the target organ by 
the action of testosterone-5α-reductase. It is also known that inhibitors 
of testosterone-5α-reductase will serve to prevent or lessen symptoms 
of hyperandrogenic stimulation. For example, a number of 4-aza  
 
steroid compounds are known which are 5α-reductase inhibitors. See the following Merck & Co., Inc. patents, U.S. Patent 
Nos. 4,377,584, 4,220,775, 4,859,681, 4,760,071 and the articles J. 
Med. Chem. 27, p. 1690-1701 (1984) and J. Med. Chem. 29, 2998-2315 
(1986) of Rasmusson, et al., and U.S. Patent 4,845,104 to Carlin, et al., 
and U.S. Patent 4,732,897 to Cainelli, et al. which describe 4-aza-17β-substituted-5α-androstan-3-ones 
said to be useful in the treatment of 
DHT-related hyperandrogenic conditions. Further there is the suggestion in the early prior art that 
hyperandrogenic diseases are the result of a single 5α-reductase. 
However, there are later reports regarding the presence of other 5α-reductase 
isozymes in both rats and humans. For example, in human 
prostate, Bruchovsky, et al. (See J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 67,
