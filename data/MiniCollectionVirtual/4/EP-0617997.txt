<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing carbon membranes having controlled pore 
sizes comprises the steps of: a) causing a stream of a pyrolysable carbon-containing 

gas to come into contact with a carbon membrane having a 
pore size and/or distribution larger than the desired pore size and/or 

distribution; b) raising the ambient temperature of the said membrane 
to or above the temperatures at which the adsorbed carbon-containing 

gas pyrolyzes; and c) substantially purging the atmosphere 
surrounding the membrane from carbon-containing gas;

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to carbon membranes for gas separation.
More particularly, the invention relates to a method of improving the
permeability-selectivity combination of carbon membranes toward gas
separation by the carbon chemical vapor deposition (CVD).The manufacturing of carbon membranes has been described before, e.g.,
in U.S. Patent No. 4,685,940 and in British Patent GB 2,207,666.
However, membranes made according to the known art were produced by
attempting to tailor the size of the pores by modifying them in chemical-thermo
treatments which substantially only increased the size of the
pores.It has now been found, and this is an object of the invention, that it is
possible to increase the selectivity of carbon membranes by closing and re-opening
its pores under controlled conditions.It has further been found, and this is another object of the invention, that
it is possible to manufacture carbon membranes having controlled pore
sizes, by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hydrocarbon gases in the
pore system.It has also been found, and this is still another object of the invention,
that, by means of CVD, it is possible to produce asymmetric membranes 
using homogeneous (symmetric) carbon membranes as the starting
membrane.Other objectives and advantages of the invention will become apparent as
the description proceeds.Carbon membranes for gas separation are porous solids which may be
developed so as to acquire pores of molecular dimension. If they have no
pores of larger dimensions, these membranes act as molecular sieves.As a separation membrane material, its quality is determined mainly by
two properties: the permeability of the more permeable gas, and the
selectivity which is the ratio between the permeabilities of the more
permeable and the less permeable components of the gas mixture
separated. However, when a membrane is formed from the raw
(membrane) material, its wall thickness becomes as important as its
permeability as a membrane material, as will be more fully explained
hereinafter.The permeability of a membrane is defined as the amount of fluid (in
moles or an equivalent unit such as cc (STP) that flows through a
membrane of unit thickness, per unit surface area, per unit time and per
unit pressure difference. It expresses the inherent property of the
membrane material indifferent of its thickness. A common permeability
unit is: cc(STP) - cm-sec-1-cm2-cm(Hg)-1.
Another unit is the "Barrer" whereas: 
1 Barrer = 10-10 [cc(STP)-cm-sec-1-cm-2-cm(Hg)-1].The specific flux of a
