<ABSTRACT>
An ink-jet apparatus (10) and method provides 
high-resolution, high-speed printing by providing a 

transducer drive waveform (160) having a spectral energy 
distribution (170) that concentrates energy (172) around a 

frequency associated with a dominant (Helmholtz) ink drop 
ejection mode and that suppresses energy (174) at resonant 

frequencies associated with ink inlet (18) and ink outlet 
structures (24, 26, 28, 14) of the ink-jet head. Spectral 

energy distribution principles used to shape the 
transducer drive waveform can be used to enhance the 

jetting performance of many conventional ink-jet heads.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ink-jet printing and
more particularly to a method and an apparatus for ejecting
ink drops from an ink-jet head at substantially constant
ejection velocities over a wide range of ejection
repetition rates.There are previously known apparatus and methods
for ejecting ink drops from an ink-jet print head at a high
repetition rate. The physical laws governing ink-jet drop
formation and ejection are complexly interactive.
Therefore, U.S. Pat. No. 4,730,197, issued March 8, 1988
for an IMPULSE INK JET SYSTEM describes and characterizes
numerous interactions among ink-jet geometric features,
transducer drive waveforms, ink meniscus and pressure
chamber resonance, and ink drop ejection characteristics.
A multiple-orifice print head is thereafter described in
which "dummy channels" and compliant chamber walls are
provided to minimize drop nonuniformity caused by jet-to-jet
cross-talk. Increased drop ejection rates are achieved
with piezoelectric transducer ("PZT") drive waveform
compensation techniques that account for print head
resonances, fluidic resonances, and past droplet timing
compensation. The adaptive PZT drive waveform circuitry
and complex ink-jet head structures achieve drop ejection
rates "up to and including seven KHz."U.S. Pat. No. 5,170,177, issued December 8, 1992,
for a METHOD OF OPERATING AN INK JET TO ACHIEVE HIGH PRINT
QUALITY AND HIGH PRINT RATE, assigned to the assignee of 
the present application, describes PZT drive waveforms
having a spectral energy distribution that is minimized at
the "dominant acoustic resonant frequency". The dominant
frequency is described as including any of the meniscus
resonance frequency, Helmholtz resonance frequency, PZT
drive resonance frequency, and various acoustic resonance
frequencies of the different channels and passageways
forming the ink-jet print head. Suppressing PZT energy at
the ink-jet outlet channel resonant frequency is said to
produce a constant ink drop volume and ejection velocity at
drop ejection rates up to 10 KHz.Subjecting ink drops to an electric field is
known to increase ink drop ejection repetition rate as
described in copending European Patent EP-A-437062
(corresponding to U.S. Pat. Application No.
07/892494 of Roy et al., filed June 3, 1992, for METHOD AND
APPARATUS FOR PRINTING WITH A DROP-ON-DEMAND INK-JET PRINT
HEAD USING AN ELECTRIC FIELD). A time invariant electric
field provides time-to-paper compensation for ink drops of
different volumes, provides a wider range of drop volume
ejection, and
