<ABSTRACT>
The addition of a small amount of a halogen compound, 
e.g. chloroethyl phosphate, in a process producing elasÂ­

tomeric polyurethane RIM parts using tertiary amines as the 
chief catalyst component results in scavenging the residual 

amines after the part has been cured by annealing. The parts 
from such a process can be coated with a wide variety of 

enamels having a high solids content and completely cured 
to result in a higher degree of adhesive between the coating 

and the part's surface than those parts from a process 
without the use of such a halogen.
