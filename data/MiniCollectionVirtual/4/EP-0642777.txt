<ABSTRACT>
An arm support garment comprising a tube-like shaped 
stretchable material applied on arms' area, wherein a stretchable 

material having a comparatively weak straining force is applied 
to the portion which in use covers the motor points of each of 

the flexor muscle group and the extensor muscle group, extending 
generally along the longitudinal direction of the user's forearm 

parts; and wherein a stretchable material having a comparatively 
strong straining force is applied to the portion which in use 

covers the vicinity of the both longitudinal sides of said motor 
point of the flexor muscle group and/or the extensor muscle 

group. 
The present invention provides arm support garments which 
are easy to put on and to wear appropriately, preventing blood 

circulation disorders, able to follow the wearer's arm's twisting 
movements without hindering the arm's smooth movements, and 

capable of relieving or preventing arm's muscle fatigue. And 
therefore, the garments are ideal for various sports or training 

application, such as baseball, tennis, bicycling, or 
motorcycling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to arm support garments, and
more specifically to an arm support garment which is applied
closely onto the surface of human forearms primarily to prevent
muscle fatigue therein.These days it is well known that concentrated long-time use
of forearms by sports or training activities such as baseball,
tennis, bicycling, motorcycling contributes not only to
accumulating factors of fatigue including lactic acid in the
vicinity of the muscles in use to cause fatigue but also to
muscle disorders such as muscle pain. In order to prevent such
muscle pain or to permit continued sports practice while
protecting the damaged part even when one gets muscle ache,
sometimes taping treatment is applied on the muscle region to
support the area by compressing strongly around the region to
limit the muscle stretch and movements of the muscle. Also
supporters of a tube-like shape made of a stretchable relatively
thick pile fabric or neoprene are often used to compress human
body parts, such as arms, inwardly from the circumference. However, the above-mentioned conventional taping method
requires skill and if the treatment is applied inadequately, it
not only fails to accomplish the prevention or treatment purpose
but also can produce an adverse effect on the muscle area such as
disturbing physical movements, increased susceptibility to blood
circulation disorders or nervous disorders. Therefore the taping
method can be applied only by those who are skilled in the method
but not by those who are not.As for the latter supporter method, such supporters can be
worn easily but they simply compress strongly the entire region
to be protected. Thus, they compress the muscle groups' motor
points significantly and also prevent proper blood circulation
and cause discomfort. This may result in blood circulation
disorders providing little effect to alleviate the muscle
fatigue. Moreover, because the supporters are made by thick
rubber materials such as neoprene or thick pile fabric, they have
such shortcomings as disturbing arms' movements or becoming
stuffy due to their bad breathability. EP-A-0 519 135 discloses wearing articles or clothes with a
taping function and in particular an elbow supporter in
which a heavily-stretchable cloth piece is provided so as to
be disposed on the upper arm portion and the front arm
portion.GB-A-2 242 818 discloses covering articles, e.g. a tennis
elbow outfit, and a method of making-up thereof. It is an object of the present invention to provide an arm
support garment
