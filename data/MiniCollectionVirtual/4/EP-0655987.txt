<ABSTRACT>
Filler block (10) for making trickling filters or immersion trickling filters, as used for the biological treatment of waste water. The pipe sections (11) of which the filler block (10) is composed have a network-like jacket (12) in which the pipe sections (11) are bonded on the jacket side by jointing points (13) to prevent narrowings in the free cross-section of the pipe sections (11).

<CLAIMS>
Contact-filter block for the construction of
trickling filters or rotating disc filters for the

biological treatment of, in particular, waste waters,
comprising a plurality of tube sections (11, 22) which

are joined together and have an outside surface
preferably structured in a net-like manner (net-type

tubes), the outside surfaces of the tube sections (11,
22) being joined together by joints (13) at oppositely

situated end regions of the tube sections (11, 22), and
by at least one further joint (13) between the end

joints (13) which are disposed on a common contact line
(15, 25) between in each case two adjacent tube sections

(11, 22).
Contact-filter block according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the joints (13) are joined

together only in the region of the contact lines (15,
25) of the outside surfaces (12) of adjacent tube

sections (11).
Contact-filter block according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the tube

sections (11) are disposed and joined in rows and lines
in such a way that the line and row spacing corresponds

approximately to the diameter of the tube section (11).
Contact-filter block according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the tube

sections (11) are disposed and joined in rows and lines
so as to be offset with respect to one another in such a 

way that the line and row spacing is less than the
diameter of the tube section (11).
Contact-filter block according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the joints (13)

are formed by welding, in particular by pressure welding
and/or spot weldin
g, preferably in the form of a spot
and/or linear weld.
Contact-filter block according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the parallel

tube sections (11) are joined to form a strip (20) and
the latter is rolled up spirally to form a contact-filter

block (19).
Contact-filter block according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that, in the case of

tube sections (11) constructed as net-type tubes, the
joints (13) are provided at strands of the net-type

tubes, preferably at crossovers of circumferential
strands (17) and longitudinal strands (16).
Contact-filter block according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that at least one

joining web (23) extends essentially radially from an
outside surface (24) of the tube sections (22) in the

direction of each adjacent tube section (22) and the
joints (13) are disposed at corresponding joining webs

(23) of adjacent tube sections (22).
Contact-filter block according to Claim 8,
characterized in that the joining web (23) extends

approximately over the length of the tube sections (22)
and the joints (13) are preferably associated only with

subregions of the joining web (23).
Contact-filter block according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the joining webs

(23) have an interrupted pattern having at least two
subregions which are spaced apart and with which one

joint (13) is associated in each case.
