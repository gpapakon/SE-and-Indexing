<ABSTRACT>
A process for converting a chlorinated alkene 
feedstock including two or more chlorines to reaction 

products including a less-chlorinated alkene in a 
commercially substantial proportion, comprising reacting 

the chlorinated alkene feedstock with hydrogen in the 
presence of a catalyst consisting essentially of a Group 

VIII metal other than rhodium, palladium or ruthenium 
and
 a Group IB metal on a support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
processes for converting chlorinated hydrocarbons to 
less chlorinated products and to the catalysts used in 
such processes. European Patent Application EP 0496446A 
describes the preparation of chlorotrifluoroethylene and 
trifluoroethylene from 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2--trifluoroethane 
via a catalyst comprised of copper and 
a Group VIII metal (palladium and platinum being 
preferred) on a carbon support. Several prior 
publications address the same conversion and describe 
the same or different catalysts, see, for example EP 
0253410B, EP 0355907B and EP 0459463A. None of these 
publications describes or suggests, however, that other 
halogenated feedstocks might be suitably catalytically 
converted to less halogenated and more useful or more 
salable materials, and in particular none of these 
references suggest that the catalysts described therein 
might be useful outside of the fluorocarbon art. A seemingly separate course of development has 
occurred with respect to the class of chlorinated 
hydrocarbon feedstocks which are exclusive of the 
chlorofluorocarbon feedstocks, and within the art 
pertaining to this class of materials are a number of 
references which relate more particularly to the 
conversion of a chlorinated alkene feedstock (which 
hereafter shall be taken as excluding the  
 
chlorofluorocarbon materials) to a less chlorinated 
alkene product. Canadian Patent No. 1,119,203, for example, 
describes the conversion of perchloroethylene to 
trichloroethylene via a catalyst including an activated 
carbon carrier, copper metal or a copper compound, one 
or more of the palladium, ruthenium or rhodium metals or 
compounds thereof, and optionally, an alkali metal 
compound as a promoter. Earlier processes for 
converting perchloroethylene to trichloroethylene in the 
presence of copper salts on alumina, and including 
activation by alkali metal salts are also described. German Patent Publication DE 3804265A is 
similar to the Canadian reference in describing a method 
for preparing trichloroethylene from hydrogen and 
perchloroethylene over a carrier catalyst of an 
activated charcoal carrier, copper in an elemental or 
chemically-bonded (compound) form, rhodium in an 
elemental or chemically-bonded form, and an organic 
phosphine or phosphite promoter. An earlier provisional specification is 
referenced in this publication which purportedly 
describes a method for preparing trichloroethylene from 
hydrogen and perchloroethylene, in which the
