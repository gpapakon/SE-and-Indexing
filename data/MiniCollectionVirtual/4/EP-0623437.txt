<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting apparatus
for cutting large objects of different materials, such as
stone, wood and other substances according to the preamble
of claim 1.Conventionally, cutting a large stone, for example,
is carried out with a cutting blade, a band saw, a wire
saw and other cutting methods.A cutting blade is a device containing a plurality of
cutting bits in which chips of abrasive grains, such as
fine diamond abrasive grains are firmly embedded. The
abrasive layers are bonded to an outer peripheral surface
of a disc-like metal base formed by roll processing, by
means of metal bond or the like at equal intervals. At
present, the maximum cutting blade manufactured has a
diameter of 3.5 m and a metal base thickness of 10 mm.
For the cutting blade of this dimension or size, the
maximum thickness of a material which can be cut is of
the order of 1.5 m, and the cutting loss is of the order
of 15 mm.On the other hand, a band saw is a device having a
thin strip of metal, which is wide and which is of the
order of 1 mm to 6 mm in thickness, is welded to form an
endless loop, and the abrasive grains and chips are
firmly bonded to one side of the endless thin strip. The
endless thin strip is driven by a pair of rotating circular 
wheels, whose axes are arranged in parallel relation to
each other. The wheels are rotated at high speed,
thereby cutting stones or the like with the edge of any
parallel sections between the rotor bodies.The wire saw is an endless loop device such that a
plurality of cylindrical diamond chips is firmly bonded
to a metal wire whose thickness is of the order of a few
millimetres to 10 mm. The wire saw is directly wound
around the object, and is driven at high speeds with a
constant tension applied by a drive apparatus, thereby
cutting the object.However, the above-described traditional cutting
methods have the following problems.First, the cutting blade has the following problem.
That is, if the diameter of the cutting blade is
increased, the thickness of the metal base must also be
increased to provide the blade rigidity. For this
reason, the cutting loss increases, and the yield from
the object is diminished. Further, twist or torsion
occurs at the forward edge of cutting as a result of an
increase in the cutting resistance. Thus, the cutting
accuracy is reduced.Further, the cutting blade has also the following
problems. Since manufacturing of a metal base exceeding
3.5 metre in diameter is extremely difficult, there is a
limit in thickness of the object
