<DESCRIPTION>
 BIADED ENDOSCOPIC RETRACTORField of the Invention The present invention relates to retractors used in surgery. More specifically, the invention relates to a bladed, expandable endoscopic retractor by which tissue, internal organs, or other internal body parts may be retracted to provide visualization and surgical access during endoscopic procedures.Background of the Invention The field of endoscopic surgery has been advancing rapidly in recent years. In this form of surgery, procedures are performed inside of the body of a patient using instruments inserted through small endosurgical ports in the body. The surgery is performed with the aid of an endoscope, which is a thin, tube-like instrument featuring a light source, viewing lenses, and/or various other attachments such as irrigators, scissors, snares, brushes, or forceps. Endoscopes may be flexible or rigid, and normally utilize optic fibers to transmit light to the internal cavity. The surgery is normally viewed by the surgeon through an ocular. Lenses are placed near the tip of the endoscope and the image thereon is transmitted via optic fibers or other lens systems, to the ocular or viewer. Other types of endoscopes utilize optical fibers to transmit electronic signals representing the internal image from the distal lens to a video monitor which is viewed by the surgeon.This form of surgery allows internal visualization of the body structure without the necessity of excessive dissection of tissue. Typical endoscopes often are in the 5 to 12 mm diameter range and thus require only very small incisions to insert them into the body.This form of surgery has developed rapidly because of the numerous benefits arising in favor of the patient. Since there is only a small incision to permit entrance of the endoscope, endoscopic surgery results in less trauma to the body and faster patient recovery. For the benefits of endoscopic surgery to arise, however, all aspects of the 

surgery, such as the initial examination, retraction, and the surgical procedure itself, must be accomplished through small surgical incisions or ports.The obvious difficulty associatedwith endoscopic surgery is inadequate visualization of the internal structure required to properly complete the surgical procedure. Endoscopic surgery is thus difficult in areas which are typically difficult to reach, such as the gallbladder. In gallbladder surgery, (or "cholecystectomy") the tissue and organs surrounding the gallbladder are examined with the endoscope and retracted in order to

8. The retractor of any of Claims 6 or 7, wherein said blades are mounted such that said blades assume said angular, spaced position simultaneously and proportional to a single movement of said actuator.
9. The retractor of any of Claims 6 to 8, wherein said blades are mounted such that their angular and spaced positions result from independent movements of said actuator. 10. The retractor of any of Claims 6 to 9, wherein said actuator comprises dual mechanisms, a first mechanism for causing extension of said blades and a second mechanism for causing said blades to be spaced apart.
11. The retractor of any of Claims 6 to 10, further comprising a plurality of control members, each of said control members engaging the proximal end of one of said blades, and wherein the retractor comprises a plurality of actuators, each of said actuators being connected to one of said control members, whereby said blades are independently manipulatable.
