<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of highly filled plastic mouldings from polymer material known per se having metallic sheen on the upper and lower side of the mouldings by means of a suitable mould, in which a matrix material MM containing the polymer precursor and non-metallic fillers FS known per se is doped with metal particles MP known per se and metallized plastic particles KP, whose density is below the density of the matrix material MM containing the filler material, and the polymerisation and subsequently the demoulding are carried out in a manner known per se.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing highly filled plastics
mouldings from polymer material known 
per se
 with a
metal lustre on the top and bottom of the moulding using

a suitable mould, characterised in that the matrix
material MM containing the polymer precursor and non-metallic

fillers FS known 
per se
, on the one hand, are
doped with metal particles MP known 
per se
 and
metallised plastics particles KP, the density of which

is less than the density of the matrix material MM
containing the filler, and the polymerisation and

finally the unmoulding are carried out in a manner known

per se.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the matrix material MM is synthesised from methyl

methacrylate.
Process according to claims 1 and 2, characterised
in that the metal particles MP are selected from the

group consisting of aluminium, copper, zinc and bronzes
of said metals.
Process according to claims 1 - 3, characterised in
that the proportion of metal particles MP is from 0.1 to

5 wt.-%, based on the matrix material MM.
Process according to claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that particles based on polyester are used as the

metallised plastics particles.
Process according to claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that the proportion of metallised plastics particles

KP is from 0.1 to 5 wt.-%, based on the matrix material
MM.
