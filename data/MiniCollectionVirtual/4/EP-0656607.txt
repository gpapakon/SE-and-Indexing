<ABSTRACT>
A large number of magnetic polymer elements (12)
are distributed at random in a base material (11) of a

object (1) to be checked. Each magnetic polymer
element (12) includes an element main body formed of a

high-molecular material, such as an acrylic resin, and
magnetic metal powder contained therein. The base

material (11) is formed mainly of paper, and the
magnetic polymer elements (12) are incorporated

together with wood pulp fibers in the base material
(11). The elements (12) and the fibers are tangled

with one another in three dimensions. Indication data
(17) including figures, symbols, etc., such as post

position numbers and bet numbers on betting tickets for
publicly-managed gambling, are printed on the object

(1). The indication data (17), along with a proper
output signal obtained in accordance with the state of

distribution of the magnetic polymer elements (12), are
enciphered according to specific rules for enciphering,

and are recorded in a code indicator section (6) by
means of a recording medium, such as a magnetic stripe

which is magnetically readable or a bar code which is
optically readable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to objects which
should be prevented from being forged and are to be
checked for authenticity, such as important documents,
securities, paper money, merchandise bonds and other
coupons, checks, traveler's checks, bank cards, credit
cards, prepaid cards, admission tickets for various
entertainments and parties, passenger tickets for
various vehicles and aricrafts, and betting tickets for
publicly-managed gambling (e.g., speedboat, bicycle,
and horse races), and a method for manufacturing the
same.A checking method and apparatus utilizing
microwaves are known in the art as measures for
checking the authenticity of documents or the like, as
described in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 5-270181
and PCT National Publication No. 63-501250
(i.e., U.S. Patent No. 4,820,912). In this prior art
method or apparatus, microwaves are applied to a large
number of metallic wires, such as stainless-steel
wires, which are distributed at random in a document or
the like, and a proper digital mark corresponding to a
response microwave bundle is recorded in a suitable
region of the document according to specific rules. In
checking the document for authenticity, the microwaves
are applied to the document, and the digital mark is
collated with the response microwave bundle. If the 
mark and the microwave bundle agree with each other, it
is concluded that the document is authentic.Checking means which utilizes microwaves, such as
the one used in the conventional apparatus described in
the aforesaid publications, is liable to be influenced
by external noises as it measures the response
microwave bundle, so that its signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N ratio) is low. Moreover, the prior art apparatus,
which oscillates microwaves, may possibly constitute a
source of noises. In general, furthermore, microwave
transmitters and receivers are large-sized and
expensive.In the case where metallic wires are embedded in a
thin object, such as paper, there is a possibility of
the wires being exposed in the surface of the object.
If this occurs, the metallic wires are so conspicuous
that the security cannot be maintained. In the case
where the object containing the metallic wires is cut
into pieces of a desired size by means of a cutter, the
wires may partially project from cut edges of the
object, or the cutter life may be shortened
considerably. Moreover, the metallic wires constitute
a hindrance to satisfactory printing or coloring, and
may rust in some cases.When the object is bent, the metallic wires may
poss
