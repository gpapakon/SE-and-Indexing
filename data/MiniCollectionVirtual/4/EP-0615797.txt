Straightening machine (1), particularly for straightening plates and strips, with
upper and lower straightening rolls (11, 13) which are arranged displaced relative to one

another and which are supported over their length by means of backing rolls (12, 14)
arranged in roll carriages (6, 7) which are in turn supported at crossbeams (4, 5), wherein

at least the upper crossbeam (5) is adjustable for positioning the straightening rolls by
means of adjusting cylinders (8), and compensation cylinders (17, 18) arranged between

the roll carriage and the crossbeam, characterised thereby that the upper roll carriage (6)
and the upper crossbeam (5) have bend lines (19, 20, 21, 21') which extend transversely

to the running direction of the stock to be straightened and which are provided in several
planes disposed one above the other.
Straightening machine according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the bend
lines (17, 20, 21, 21') are arranged in the region of the adjusting cylinder (8), the

compensation cylinder (18), the upper straightening rolls (13) and webs (23), which project
towards the lower roll carriage (7), of the upper roll carriage (6).
Straightening machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that flat
guides (19) form the bending lines arranged in the region of the compensation cylinder

(18),
Straightening machine according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised
thereby that the roll carriage (6) and the crossbeam (5) are provided with lateral guides

(22), which have outer surfaces curved out towards the machine pedestal (2).
