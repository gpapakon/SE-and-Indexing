Pentene derivatives corresponding to general formula 
(I): 


 
in which - independently of one another - the substituent 

R
1
 is hydrogen or a methyl group, the substituents R
2
 and 
R
3
 represent an alkyl group containing 1 to 5 carbon 
atoms, the substituent R
4
 is hydrogen or a group CHR
5
R
6
, 
where the substituents R
5
 and R
6
 are hydrogen or an alkyl 
group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and X is a group CO 

or a group CHOH. 
Pentene derivatives as claimed in claim 1, in which 
the substituents R
2
 and R
3
 are methyl or ethyl. 
Pentene derivatives as claimed in claim 2, in which 
the substituent R
4
 is a methyl group. 
Pentene derivatives as claimed in claim 2, in which 
the substituent R
4
 is hydrogen. 
A process for the production of the pentene derivatives 
corresponding to general formula (I): 


 
in which - independently of one another - the substituent 

R
1
 is hydrogen or a methyl group, the substituents R
2
 and 
R
3
 represent an alkyl group containing 1 to 5 carbon 
atoms, the substituent R
4
 is hydrogen or a group CHR
5
R
6
, 
where the substituents R
5
 and R
6
 are hydrogen or an alkyl 
group containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and X is a group CO  

 
or a group CHOH, by 


(a) reaction of allyl alcohols corresponding to general 
formula (II): 


 
in which the substituent R
1
 is hydrogen or a methyl 
group,
 
with aldehydes corresponding to general formula 

(III): 

CHR
2
R
3
-CHO
 
in which the substituents R
2
 and R
3
 independently of 
one another represent an alkyl group containing 1 to 

5 carbon atoms,
 
or 
(b) alkylation of compounds corresponding to general 
formula (IV): 


 
in which the substituent R
1
 is hydrogen or a methyl 
group,
 
and, optionally, subsequent reduction of the carbonyl 

group to the OH function, for example with complex  
 

hydrides. 
The use of the pentene derivatives claimed in claims 
1 to 5 as fragrances. 
Fragrance compositions containing one or more of the 
pentene derivatives corresponding to formula (I) claimed 

in claims 1 to 6 in a quantity of 1 to 70% by weight, 
based on the composition as a whole. 
The use of one or more of the pentene derivatives 
corresponding to formula (I) claimed in claims 1 to 7 as 

fragrances in cosmetic preparations, commercial products 
or alcohol-based perfumery.
