A sun visor for vehicles comprising a sun visor 
body (1) formed approximately like a rectangular 

plate of dark colored, for instance black 
polypropylene particle foam and with a depression 

(2) on a main surface of the sun visor body (1), for 
fitting a reflector (4) and a mirror arrangement 

(1) above the reflector and an illumination device, 

characterized in that
 the reflector (4) is a heat 
compressed bright, preferably white polypropilene 

particle foam body which is pressed with the sun 
visor body (1) inside the depression (2). 
A sun visor according to claim 1
, characterized in 
that
 the reflector (4) is pressed and fused with the 
sun visor body (1) inside the depression (2). 
A sun visor according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in that
 the reflector (4) comprises on 
the front side bolts or pins (6) for securing a 

circuit board (9) with respective openings (8), the

 in a second foam mould are 
introduced bright colored polypropilene particles 

which are formed to a form body (3) adapted to the 
depression (2) of the sun visor body (1), the bright 

colored form body (3) is introduced in the depression 
(2) of the sun visor body (1) and then the bright 

colored form body (3) is pressed by simultaneous 
heating and compression towards the bottom of the  

 
depression (2), whereby it is compressed and deformed 

in order to form a reflector (4). 
A method according to claim 6, 
characterized in
