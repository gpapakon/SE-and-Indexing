<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
apparatus for conveying sheet members in an image-forming 
machine such as an electrostatic copying 
machine, a facsimile or a printer and, particularly, 
to an apparatus for conveying sheet members in which 
a conveyer guide member is disposed on the downstream 
side of a toner image-transfer position of a 
photosensitive drum. There has heretofore been known and put 
into practical use an apparatus for conveying sheet 
members equipped with a conveyer guide member 
inclusive of a guide portion that extends from the 
downstream side of a toner image-transfer position of 
a photosensitive drum toward a fixing unit. The 
guide portion of the conveyer guide member is so 
constituted as to guide a sheet member that is 
conveyed through the toner image-transfer position, 
toward the fixing unit along the upper surface 
thereof. Here, the apparatus for conveying sheet 
members must simultaneously satisfy the following 
three requirements in a step in which a sheet member 
onto which the toner has been transferred at the 
toner image-transfer position is being conveyed to 
the fixing unit via the conveyer guide member. 
(1) The sheet member to which the toner image 
has been transferred must be reliably separated from 
the surface of the photosensitive drum without being 
taken up by the photosensitive drum (excellent 
separating performance). (2) The sheet member separated from the surface 
of the photosensitive drum must be smoothly and  
 
reliably conveyed along the upper surface of the 
guide portion without floating on the upper surface 
of the guide portion of the conveyer guide member 
(excellent conveying performance). (3) Vivid image must be guaranteed after fixing 
without permitting the toner transferred onto the 
sheet member to be scattered. A conveyer guide member made of an ABS 
resin has heretofore been used in the conventional 
apparatus for conveying sheet members. The conveyer 
guide member has a function for mechanically guiding 
the sheet member onto which the toner has been 
transferred to the fixing unit as well as a function 
for releasing excess of electric charge imparted to 
the sheet member when the toner is transferred 
thereon. The conveyer guide member is provided with 
the latter function in order to improve the above-mentioned 
separating performance and conveying 
performance, as well as to prevent the occurrence of 
toner scattering. Here, when the electric charge 
imparted to the sheet member abruptly migrates to the 
conveyer guide
