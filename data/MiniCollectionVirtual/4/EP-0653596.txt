<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of the invention is the filling and draining of a solar collector 3 which is filled with water and in which frost damage should be prevented from occurring. For this purpose, it is proposed to initiate and carry out the emptying solely by the force of gravity, the piping 8c leading to the solar collector 3 and the piping 9c returning from the solar collector 3 being connected V3, V4 in each case via a junction 20, 21 to a common collection container 11. Prior to emptying, by mixing in Mi, 8a warm water or by mere recirculation 2 in the solar collector circulation 8b, 8c, 9c, 9b, Z, Mi, any (necessary) emptying can be delayed and possibly avoided. Following an emptying operation, the solar collector can be filled again by means of a pressure generator 10, M, Pd, the heat transporting medium being pumped into the collector 3 via one of the said piping systems 8c, 9c, and the pressure thus arising corresponding approximately to the stationary operating pressure of the solar collector piping system 8a, 8b, 8c, 9c, 9b, 9a.
