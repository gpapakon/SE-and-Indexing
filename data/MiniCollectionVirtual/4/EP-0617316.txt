<ABSTRACT>
A film cassette (1) comprises a light-shielding 
door (7) for preventing ambient light from entering the 

cassette interior, a film spool (9) supported for rotation in 
film unwinding and film winding directions (U,W), and a locking 

device (11) supported for movement into engagement with the 
spool to secure the spool and out of engagement with the 

spool to release the spool. According to the invention, 
the door is supported for closing movement to prevent 

ambient light from entering the cassette interior and for 
opening movement, and includes cam means (47) for moving the 

locking device into engagement with the spool responsive 
to closing movement of the door. Also, the locking 

device is resilient to permit it to be temporarily 
deformed should it be obstructed from being moved by the 

cam means to engage the spool and the light-shielding 
means is forcibly closed, or should it be engaging the 

spool and the spool is forcibly rotated in the film 
unwinding and winding directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to commonly assigned
copending U.S. applications Serial No. 07/787356, entitled
FILM CASSETTE WITH INTEGRATED CASSETTE ELEMENT LOCK AND
LIGHT BLOCKING DEVICE and filed Nov. 4, 1991 in the name
of Dennis R. Zander, corresponding to EP-A-0 540 938 published May 12, 1993, and
constituting prior art within the meaning of Article 54(3), EPC, and Serial No. 08/034,978, entitled
FILM CASSETTE WITH SPOOL LOCK AND LIGHT-SHIELDING DOOR,
filed March 22, 1993 in the names of Dennis R. Zander
and Hideaki Kataoka and issued May 31, 1994 as US-A-5 317 355 after the priority date of the present application.The invention relates generally to the field of
photography, and in particular to a film cassette
containing a film spool about which a filmstrip is
coiled. More specifically, the invention relates to a
film cassette having a spool lock for preventing rotation
of the film spool and a light-shielding door that can be
opened to permit film movement out of and back into the
cassette interior.Film cassettes provided with a spool lock for preventing unintended
rotation of a film spool inside the cassette are generally known.For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,221,479 issued Sep. 9, 1980 discloses a
film cassette adapted to be opened and closed comprising a film spool
supported for rotation, and movable locking means for inhibiting
rotation of the film spool when the cassette is closed and allowing
the film spool to rotate when the cassette is opened. The film
cassette has a pair of collar halves at each end of the cassette with
respective polygon-shaped bearing halves for receiving polygon-shaped
journals at opposite ends of the film spool. When the film cassette is
closed, rotation of film spool is inhibited because of the contact
between the bearing halves and the journals. Conversely, when the film
cassette is opened, the film spool is free to rotate because bearing
halves have been moved away from the journals. U.S. Pat. No. 5,115,268 issued May 19, 1992
discloses a film cassette comprising a light-trapping
plush for preventing ambient light from entering the
cassette interior through a film egress/ingress
passageway, a film spool supported for rotation in film
unwinding and film winding directions, and a locking pawl
supported for movement into engagement with the spool to
secure the spool and out of engagement with the spool to
release the spool. The spool has a coaxial ratchet wheel
with assymmetrically shaped teeth. The locking pawl
appears to be a rigid beam member which is pivotally
mounted at one end

<CLAIMS>
A film cassette (1) comprising light-shielding
means (7,47) for preventing ambient light from entering the

cassette interior, a film spool (9) supported for rotation,
and locking means (11) supported for movement into engagement

with said spool (9) to secure the spool (9) and out of engagement
with the spool to release the spool (9), wherein said light-shielding means (7,47) is supported for

movement between a closed position, in which ambient light is prevented from entering
the cassette interior, and an open position, characterized in that :


said light-shielding means (7,47)
includes cam means (47) arranged to move said locking means (11) into

engagement with said spool (9) responsive to closing movement
of the light-shielding means (7,47); and
said locking means (11) includes resilient means (19) arranged to
be temporarily deformed should the locking means (11) be

prevented from being moved by said cam means (47) to engage
said spool (9) and said light-shielding means (7,47) be forcibly

closed, whereby the light-shielding means (7,47) is permitted to
be closed even though the locking means (11) is obstructed.
A film cassette (1) as recited in claim 1,
wherein said spool (9) is rotatable in film unwinding and

film winding directions (U,W), and said resilient means (19)
includes integral means arranged to be temporarily deformed

should said locking means (11) be engaging said spool (9) and the
spool (9) be forcibly rotated in the film unwinding or

winding direction (U,W), whereby the spool (9) is permitted to be
rotated in the film unwinding and winding directions (U,W) even

though the locking means (11) is engaging the spool (9).
A film cassette (1) as recited in claim 1 or 2,
wherein said light-shielding means (7,47) is pivotally mounted about a first pivot axis (45)

for movement between said open and closed positions,
and said locking means (11) is pivotally mounted for

movement into and out of engagement with said spool (9) about
a second pivot axis (25) substantially parallel to said first

pivot axis.
A film cassette (1) as recited in claim 2,
wherein said locking means (11) has a symmetrically shaped

detent portion (37) for engaging said spool (9), and said spool (9) 
has a toothed periphery with respective successive teeth (15)

that are symmetrically shaped to receive said detent
portion (37) between any two adjacent ones of said teeth (15) and

to eject the detent portion (37) from between those two teeth
when said spool (9) is rotated in the film unwinding or film

winding direction (U,W).
A film cassette (1) as recited in claim 1, wherein said
film spool is supported for rotation in

film unwinding and film winding directions (U,W),
said resilient means (19) is arranged to

be deformed should the locking means (11) be obstructed
from being moved by said cam means (47) to engage said spool (9)

and said light-shielding means (7,47) be forcibly closed, or

should the locking means (11) be engaging the spool (9) and the
spool (9) be forcibly rotated in the film unwinding or

winding direction (U,W), and said resilient means (19) is capable of recovering
its size and shape after being deformed in each instance.
