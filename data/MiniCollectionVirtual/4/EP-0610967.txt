<ABSTRACT>
A slicing machine is disclosed in which a crystal ingot is sliced 
by a rotary blade (14) while the inner peripheral cutting edge 

(16) of the blade (14) is kept in a highly rigid state. In 
particular, in a slicing machine which is adapted to slice out 

a crystal ingot (20) into thin pieces by use of an inner 
peripheral cutting edge (16) of a doughnut-shaped rotary blade 

(14), an axial force is previously applied to the rotary blade 
(14) prior to starting of the slicing to thereby displace the 

rotary blade (14) in the axial direction thereof and thus, while 
the rigidity of the inner peripheral cutting edge (16) is kept 

in a high state, the crystal ingot (20) is sliced so as to 
realize a highly accurate slicing operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a slicing machine of the kind
referred to the preambles of claim 1 or 2, in particular, to
such a slicing machine in which a semiconductor ingot is sliced
out into thin pieces to manufacture semiconductor wafers.A slicing machine of the kind referred to above is known
from US-A-4,502,459, JP-A-2-134 213 or JP-A-63-312812.In the document EP-A-O 313 714
there is disclosed a machine for slicing a wafer.
The slicing blade used has an outer peripheral
edge and an inner peripheral cutting edge. The outer peripheral
edge of the blade is fixed in a pertensioned condition by the use
of a chuck body, by which radially directed forces are applied
in the outer peripheral edge of the blade.From DE-A-1 502 455 there is known a cutting blade having an
inner peripheral cutting edge, which is fixed in a pretensioned
condition in such a manner that there do exist radially directed
tension forces in the blade.In a slicing machine, an inner peripheral cutting edge
blade or an outer peripheral cutting edge blade is rotated
at a high speed and the rotating blade is then pressed
against a semiconductor ingot to thereby manufacture
semiconductor wafers. In this case, from the viewpoint of
the yield rate of the semiconductor wafers and post
treatment operation thereof, it is advantageous to
minimize the displacements of the blade during cutting as
much as possible to thereby reduce the degree of curving of
the wafers.However, recently, a semiconductor wafer having an
increased diameter has been demanded, requiring a blade
having an increased diameter. Due to the increased
diameter of the blade, the cutting position of the blade
during the cutting operation thereof may be varied, causing  
the wafer surface to be curved. In addition to this, the
surface of the wafer sliced may be curved due to the uneven
shapes of the cutting edge, clogging in the cutting edge,
the surface tension of a grinding solution, the variable
cutting resistances and the like.Under these circumstances, conventionally, there have
been proposed various measures to prevent curving of the
wafer caused by the cutting operation of the rotating blade.For example, in Publication of Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open (Tokkai) No. 61-98513, there are
provided air nozzles on both sides of the surface of a
blade and there are disposed blade sensors respectively
adjacent to the air nozzles. The position of the blade, in
which the. blade is in a non-loaded state, is set as a zero
position. If the blade sensor detects the amount of
