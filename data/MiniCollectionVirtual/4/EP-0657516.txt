<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing a clear polymeric coating on a substrate using a clear
waterborne polymeric composition having reduced microfoam.Waterborne polymeric compositions such as clear or pigmented coatings
are frequently applied to substrates by spraying techniques. Some of the common
spraying techniques used are, for example, air spray, airless spray, air-assisted
airless spray, disc and bell spray, and high volume low pressure spray. In air
spray compressed air is critical to atomize the waterborne polymeric composition
and to assist in conveying the droplets to the substrate. In airless, disc, and bell
spray techniques the waterborne polymeric composition is atomized by
mechanical means and the droplets are suspended in air on formation. Air-assisted
airless spray is a hybrid of the two spray methods described above
wherein air is used to convey the droplets which are formed mechanically; and
high volume low pressure spray is another commonly recognized variant of air
spray.Waterborne compositions containing water-soluble or water-insoluble
polymers frequently contain microfoam after they are applied to substrates by
various spraying techniques. Microfoam remaining in a dried film formed from
the spray-applied aqueous composition may detract from the appearance of the
film, particularly from the appearance of a clear, or unpigmented, film which
film may appear to be hazy.US-A- 4,749,616 discloses a heat-sealable coating composition containing an
interpolymer which may be spray-applied as an essentially unpigmented
composition. The average particle size of the interpolymer component is from
0.03 to 0.5 µm.US-A- 5,021,469 discloses a multiphase emulsion polymer having
emulsion polymer particles with an average diameter of less than 200
nanometers. A gloss paint may be formed from the multiphase emulsion
polymer. The gloss paint may be applied by spray coating.US-A-5,185,396 discloses a polymeric emulsion which may be used as a
binder for a water-based varnish. The particles of the polymeric emulsion are less
than 250 nanometers.German Patent Application DE 1619263 discloses a latex for coating needled 
carpets with synthetic fabric backing. The latex is a styrene/butadiene latex
polymer with a weighted average particle diameter of 0.16 to 0.3 µm which
avoids the formation of bubbles in the coating during drying.None of the references discloses a method for producing a spray-applied
clear waterborne composition having reduced microfoam.In accordance with the present invention
