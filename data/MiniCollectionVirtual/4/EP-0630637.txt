<ABSTRACT>
The transporting device for patients or bedridden persons comprises a movable basic frame (2), a motor drive having a motor and at least one drive wheel, support wheels (3) fastened on the four corners of the basic frame (2), a lifting and inclining device fastened on the basic frame (2), a stretcher (8) intended to transport a patient or a bedridden person and couplable to the lifting and inclining device, and a control panel (4) provided on the basic frame (2) for controlling the transporting device. The drive wheel is arranged in the centre of the basic frame (2) so as to be pivotable about a vertical axis, and the support wheels (3) are designed as steering rollers. The control panel (4) can be pivoted about a vertical axis relative to the basic frame (2). Since the drive and the lifting and inclining device are centrally installed below the support frame (9), the result is a uniform weight distribution on the movable basic frame (2), and this leads to satisfactory controllability and steerability of the transporting device. Pivoting of the control panel (4) permits easy access to the patient.

to 4,
characterized
 in that

the control panel (4) is lockable in a mid-position at the
front side of the base frame (2) for traveling operation.
Transporting device according to any one of claims 1
to 5,
characterized
 in that

in case of utilization as emergency supply mobile medical
instruments for supplying the patient are accommodated in

the control panel (4), which allow continuously supplying
the patient.
Transporting device according to any one of claims 1
to 6,
characterized
 in that

the stretcher (8) consists of X-ray permeable plastic.
Transporting device according to any one of claims 1
to 7,
characterized
 in that

the lifting and inclining mechanism consists of a slide
(114) guided on guide pillars (111), which is vertically

movable relative to the base frame (2), at the upper end of
which a frame (9) for seating the stretcher (8) is pivoted

to two transversely opposed bearings (116), a first
actuator (115) for lifting and lowering the slide (114),

respectively, relative to the base frame (2), and a second
actuator (117), one end of which is rotatably coupled to

the slide (114) and the other end of which is rotatably
coupled to another bearing of the frame (9),
wherein the three bearings of the frame (9) form a
triangle, and the frame (9) is swiveling along a transverse

axis extending through the first and second bearings (116),
upon actuation of the second actuator (117).
Transporting device according to claim 8,
characterized
 in that

the transverse axis is displaced a predetermined distance
from the center towards the portion of the frame (9) which

corresponds to the head end of the stretcher (8) when the
stretcher (8) is seated.
Transporting device according to claim 8 or 9,
characterized
 in that

the upper ends of the guide pillars (111) are supported by
a guide pillar frame (112).
Transporting device according to any one of claims 8
to 10,
characterized
