<ABSTRACT>
A shut height adjustment device (10) is provided for a 
press having a press ram (50) and a tooling ram (70) 

coupled thereto for movement toward and away from a 
base (56) during forward and reverse strokes of the 

press ram. The adjustment device (10) includes a carrier 
(12) defining a rotation axis and a plurality of 

apertures (16) concentric with the rotation axis. A 
plurality of spacers (14) are removably held in the 

plurality of apertures (16). Each of the spacers (14) 
extends parallel to the rotation axis between a pair of 

opposite end surfaces(7, 8) which accurately define a 
length of each of the spacers. Different ones of the 

spacers (14) have different lengths. The carrier(12) is 
rotatably mountable on a post coupled between the 

press and tooling rams (50, 70) such that the different 
ones of the spacers (14) may be selectively disposed 

between the press and tooling rams (50, 70) for 
engagement by opposed contact portions of the rams 

during the forward stroke of the press ram (50). The 
length of an engaged spacer defines the spaced 

relationship between the rams (50,70), and the spaced 
relationship is adjustable by engagement of the 

different ones of the spacers between the contact 
portions of the rams (50, 70).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of crimping or 
other press machines having a ram which is movable into 
proximity with a base for engaging a workpiece 
therebetween, and more particularly, to a device for 
adjusting the closest proximity of the ram with respect 
to the base in a press machine. Numerous types of press machines are used in 
industry for performing operations on a workpiece. The 
press machines typically have a ram which reciprocates 
toward and away from a base for engaging the workpiece 
therebetween. One type of press machine is an automatic 
crimping machine for crimping terminals to electrical 
conductors. Various types of terminals may be deformed, or 
crimped, around electrical conductors to provide an 
electrical connection therewith. A terminal crimping 
machine typically comprises a tooling ram carrying a 
crimping die which reciprocates toward and away from a 
base of the machine. The crimping die cooperates with 
an anvil die attached to the base to deform a terminal 
disposed therebetween when the crimping die is in 
proximity with the anvil die. Height of the terminal after deformation is 
referred to as the crimp height. The crimp height is a 
valuable indicator of quality of the crimped connection. 
A crimp height that is too large will not provide a 
secure and reliable connection, while a crimp height 
that is too small results in excessive deformation which 
will weaken or break the terminal and/or conductor, and 
in addition wastes energy in driving the machine. The crimp height is a function of shut height of 
the machine, i.e., a dimension between the crimping die 
and the anvil die when the crimping die is in its 
closest proximity with respect to the anvil die. The  
 
shut height may need to be changed to accommodate 
different sizes and types of terminals and/or conductors 
which require different crimp heights. Also, the shut 
height may need adjustment to compensate for such things 
as tooling wear, dimensional tolerances of replacement 
parts, and dimensional changes due to temperature 
variations. Devices for adjusting the shut height of automatic 
crimping machines are known. US-A-3,184,950 
discloses a shut height adjusting device for an 
automatic crimping machine having a power, or press, ram 
which drives a tooling ram carrying the crimping die 
toward the anvil die. The adjusting device comprises a 
rotary disc interposed between the press and tooling 
rams. A side of the disc facing the press ram has a 
plurality of pairs of bosses of different

A shut height adjustment device for a press having a press ram 
(50) movable through fixed forward and return strokes, and a tooling ram 

(70) coupled to the press ram for movement toward and away from a 
base (56) during the forward and return strokes, respectively, the press 

ram and tooling ram being in spaced relationship at least during the 
forward stroke, the shut height adjustment device comprising a carrier 

(12) having a plurality of spacers (14) and means for removably holding 
the plurality of spacers (14), each of the spacers (14) having a pair of 

opposite end surfaces (7,8) which accurately define a length of each 
spacer, different ones of the spacers (14) having different lengths, the 

lengths being operative selectively to define a portion of the spaced 
relationship between the rams (50,70), characterized in that:
 
   the carrier (12) is rotatable on an axis (13), whereby rotation of 

the carrier (12) about the axis (13) selectively interposes different ones 
of the spacers (14) between the rams (50,70) for adjusting the spaced 

relationship therebetween. 
The shut height adjustment device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the spacers (14) are arranged in the carrier (12) 

concentric to the axis (13). 
The shut height adjustment device according to claim 2, 
characterised in that diametrically opposite pairs of the spacers (14) have 

a same length. 
The shut height adjustment device according to claim 2, 
characterised by means (3,37) for indexing the carrier (12) at different 

angular orientations about the axis (13) to align the different ones of the 
spacers (14) between the rams (50,70). 
The shut height adjustment device according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the means for indexing includes the carrier having  

 
resilient cantilever arms (21) defining projections (3) which cooperate with 

indentations (37) on a post (35) coupled between the press and tooling 
rams. 
The shut height adjustment device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the spacers (14) have a circular cross-section. 
The shut height adjustment device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the spacers (14) are disposed in apertures (16)
