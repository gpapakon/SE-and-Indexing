A jet pipe for a high-pressure cleaning device, with two pipe members (5, 6) arranged 
concentrically with each other and each leading to a separate outlet opening (9, 11), and 

with a change-over device which connects a supply line (3) for liquid cleaning medium 
optionally only to the inner pipe member (6) or to both pipe members (5, 6), 
characterized 
in that
 the change-over device (2) displaces the jet pipe (1) and the supply line (3) 
in the axial direction relative to each other between two positions, wherein the supply 

line (3) in the closed position abuts the inner pipe member (6) of the jet pipe (1) in a 
sealed manner, whereas in the spaced position between itself and the inner pipe member 

(6) [the jet pipe (1)] frees an opening (17) leading into the outer pipe member (5) of the 

jet pipe (1). 
A jet pipe according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the inner pipe member (6) and 
the supply line (3) are constructed in a telescopic manner, and peripheral openings (17) 

in the pipe members are covered in the closed position, but are freed in the spaced position. 
A jet pipe according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the end of the supply line (3) is 
formed by a plastics sleeve (14) into which the jet pipe can be inserted to different depths 

by the change-over device (2). 
A jet pipe according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the free end of the plastics sleeve 
(14) supports axially parallel arms (16) which surround and guide the inner pipe member 

(6) in all positions of the supply line (3) relative to the concentric pipe members. 
A jet pipe according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that
 the plastics sleeve (14) is 
constructed as an insert member which is inserted into the end of a pipe of the supply line 

(3). 
A jet pipe according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the outer pipe 
member (5) is displaceable telescopically in the supply line (3) in a sealed manner. 
A jet pipe according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the changeover 
device (2) comprises a housing (22) which surrounds the connexion point between 

the supply line (3) and the two concentric pipe members (5, 6) and is rotatable about the  
 

longitudinal axis of the jet pipe (1) and which displaces the supply line (3) and the two 
concentric pipe members (5, 6) in the axial direction relative to one another by way of 

curved paths (25) and entrainment members (26) cooperating therewith. 
A jet pipe according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the housing (22) comprises two 
half shells. 
A jet pipe according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the outlet 
openings (9, 11) of the two pipe members (5, 6) are arranged axially one behind the 

other. 
A jet pipe according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the outer pipe 
member (5) consists of plastics material and the inner pipe member (6) of metal. 
A jet pipe according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 the outer pipe 
member (5) and the inner pipe member (6) are constructed as an integral extruded section.
