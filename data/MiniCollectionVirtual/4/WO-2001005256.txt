<DESCRIPTION>
 LIQUID FOOD SUSPENSIONThis invention relates to liquid suspensions of foodstuffs such as sauces, bread improver compositions, coating composition for food items, and more particularly to a flavouring and/or seasoning composition for food items such as snack foods. The invention also relates to food items coated with the compositions and to methods of preparing and using the compositions.Background of the InventionSnack foods such as potato crisps, corn chips and pork scratchings are usually coated with a seasoning and/or flavouring composition in order to render the often bland tasting basic food item palatable. Such coating compositions can consist predominantly of a seasoning such as salt (e.g. in the case of potato crisps) or can have a more complex composition.The coating behaviour of suspensions is discussed in the paper by E.R. Lang & C.K.Rha, Journal of Food Science, Vol. 47 (1981), 324-325 which discloses tests carried out on inter alia sugar-in-oil suspensions. The authors found that suspensions having a sugar content of 1-30% gave a thicker coating on a glass plate when the sugar was a relatively coarse granulated sugar (446-463 micrometre diameter particles), but that suspensions having a sugar content of 60% gave thicker coatings when powdered sugar (22-31 micrometre diameter) was used.The behaviour of food suspensions is also discussed (although not in a coating sense) in a number of patents to Procter & Gamble relating to nut pastes, nut spreads and nut butters, see in particular US-A-5693357, US-A-5518755 and WO-A-96/21364. The suspensions disclosed in the aforementioned documents, which contain relatively high concentrations of solids (greater than 50%) and are described as being spreadable, are milled using a high shear milling technique to give monomodal suspensions having carefully controlled particle size distributions. 

 EP-A-0 021 483 (also to Procter & Gamble) discloses flavour enhancing compositions comprising microfÏŠne salts having particle sizes of 1 to 10 microns.US-A-4,375,483 (Procter & Gamble) discloses a flavour-enhancing fat composition containing salt, lecithin and a hydrophilic fumed silica. The combination of the salt and lecithin is stated as providing a synergistic improvement of the anti-stick properties of the fat composition.Coating compositions are typically applied to a food item (e.g. snackfood) by spraying, tumbling or dipping techniques in which the coating is presented as a suspension or powder. A substantial problem with present coatings is that they are
