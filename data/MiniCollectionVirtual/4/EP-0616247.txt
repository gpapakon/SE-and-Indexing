<ABSTRACT>
The lense moving mechanism of a printing/developing 
machine has a pulse motor for moving the holding member 

of the interchangeable lens in the directions X and Y to 
finely adjust the position of the lens. The lens moving mechanism 

is controlled by a computer. The movement and 
position of the lens are specified by inputting numeric values, 

thus adjusting the position easily. The specified position 
of the lens is stored as channel data of the printing 

channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus of
automatically adjusting a lens in an automatic printing/developing
apparatus.More generally, the invention refers to a method and
apparatus for automatically adjusting a projection lens for
printing in an automatic photographic printing and developing
apparatus in which a plurality of exchangeable lenses or a
variable-focus lens are used.In the automatic printing/developing apparatus, the adjustment
of a lens is carried out by rotating a ring or bolts
of the adjustment mechanism after loosening the fixing bolts.
First, a description will be made regarding the procedure of
lens adjustment in a conventional printing/developing apparatus
in which a plurality of fixed focus projection lenses are
used for printing.When exchanging lenses, an operator opens a protective
cover and sets a lens suitable for a print size and an enlargement
ratio. The operator uses a focus chart attached to
a negative mask to project the image of the focus chart onto
a printing paper to check whether or not the image is properly
focused on the paper. In order to adjust the focus, the operator loosens bolts
of the lens, and adjusts the focus by rotating an adjustment
ring while observing the image of the focus chart on the
printing paper. Then, the operator lightly fastens 
the bolts to fix the lens for adjusting the optical axis.
In this adjustment of the optical axis, the operator moves
the cylindrical lens holder after loosening bolts for
optical axis adjustment so that the center of the printing
paper coincides with the center of the focus chart.After fastening the bolts for optical axis adjustment
to complete the adjustment of the optical axis, the
inclination is also adjusted if it is required. If the
inclination is adjusted, the optical axis is adjusted again.
The focus is then checked, and fine adjustment is carried
out to complete the adjustment of the lens.When the lens is exchanged with a different one,
another adjustment is carried out for the new lens after the
exchange of lenses.Thus, with conventional automatic printing/developing
apparatus, in the case where a plurality of fixed-focus
lenses are used as projection lenses for printing, the lens
is exchanged whenever the enlargement ratio is changed.
Therefore, the focus and the optical axis must be adjusted
for each of the lenses.Since the adjustment of the focus and the adjustment of
the optical axis are manually performed after loosening the
fixing bolts and the adjustment bolts, only skilled
operators can carry
