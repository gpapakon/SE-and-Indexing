<ABSTRACT>
A signal processing apparatus comprising a signal 
holding circuit to hold an input signal from a signal 

source, a coupling capacitor provided on the signal 
source side, a connecting circuit to selectively 

connect the coupling capacitor and the signal holding 
circuit, and an adding circuit to add the input signal 

from the signal source on the basis of the signal held 
in the signal holding circuit. The adding circuit 

includes a buffer circuit and a switch to selectively 
connect the buffer circuit and the output side of the 

coupling capacitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a signal processing
apparatus for processing a plurality of individual
signals which are used in an memory device, a
photoelectric converting apparatus, or the like.Such an apparatus is eg known from WO91/11812 and
reflected by the preamble of claim 1.In a semiconductor memory device represented by a
read only memory (ROM) or an image sensor, there is
used a construction such that output signals from
signal sources such as memory cells or photo cells are
time-sequentially output to the output port by using
shift registers on the basis of an XY address method by
the vertical and horizontal scans.As disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Application No. 63-86679, as one of conventional
techniques, a signal process such as to add a plurality
of signals is executed by a photoelectric converting
apparatus or the like.However, at the stage of processing the signals,
it is required to further improve with respect to the
enlargement of a dynamic range or the increase in S/N
ratio.It is an object of the invention to solve the
above technical subject and to provide a signal
processing apparatus which has a large dynamic range
and which can execute signal processes at a high S/N
ratio.According to an embodiment of the invention, the
above object is accomplished by a signal processing
apparatus comprising: signal holding means for holding
an input signal from a signal source; a coupling
capacitor connected with one side to the signal source;
connecting means connected between the other side of the
coupling capacitor and the signal holding means;
amplifying means provided across said connecting means
through switching means, characterized in that said
connecting means is a switch.According to the embodiment of the invention,
since only the signal components can be substantially
added so as to cancel the noise components, the dynamic
range is widened and the adding process having an
excellent S/N ratio can be executed.The above and other objects and features of the
present invention will become apparent from the
following detailed description and the appended claims
with reference to the accompanying drawings.Fig. 1 is a circuit constructional diagram of a 
signal processing apparatus according to an embodiment
1 of the invention;Fig. 2 is a graph showing characteristics of a
buffer circuit which is used in the invention;Fig. 3 is a timing chart for explaining the
operation of the signal processing apparatus according
to the embodiment 1;Fig. 4 is a timing chart for explaining the
operation
