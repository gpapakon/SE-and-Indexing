<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mixtures utilizable 
in refrigerating circuits working according to Rankine 
cycle, particularly in refrigerating circuits working in motor-vehicles 
provided with air conditioning. As it is known, R12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) is up to 
now the most used refrigerant for these applications. One 
has, however, to bear in mind that the production of this 
product will be put aside, as well known, owing to the law 
in force (Protocol of Montreal and its subsequent modifications) 
with different modalities and times for all applications 
due to its high destroying potential as to the ozone 
present in the stratosphere. HFC 134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) has been proposed 
in the art as its substitute. The use of this product, however, 
assumes a new planning of the system working with R12 
and also the utilization of another type of lubricating oil. 
The oil traditionally used with R12 is of naphthenic type, 
while the one required by HFC 134a belongs to the class of 
polyalkyleneglycols. The two lubricants are not compatible 
and moreover chlorine traces deriving from the decomposition  
 
of R12 irreparably damage the lubricants of the polyalkyleneglycol 
type. Therefore in the existing equipment utilizing R12, it 
will be no longer possible to carry out the filling up of 
the refrigerant, which is necessary owing to the unavoidable 
losses. As such equipment is considered it might be still 
used for many years, it is desirable to find a solution allowing 
its utilization. It should therefore be necessary to find a substitute, 
bearing in mind that this must not virtually require any 
kind of modification of elements, materials and, in general, 
components of the system in which it comes to work. In 
practice this solution is known in the art as "drop in". The present invention puts itself in the "drop in" 
area, providing only for the replacement of the refrigerant 
R12 and utilizing the existing equipment relating to the 
average refrigeration, in particular the one of vehicles 
endowed with air conditioning. One of the basic problems of the equipment for the 
field of motor-vehicles conditioning is the one of freezing 
gas losses. This problem, common to all refrigerating systems 
at average or high pressure, results indeed particularly 
heavy in the specific case of motor-vehicles conditioning.  
 It is known in the art also the use of freezing mixtures 
consisting of fluorocarbons. However if the refrigerant 
is an ordinary mixture, there is fractionation in the 
pas
