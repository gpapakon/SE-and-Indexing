<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger (16) with finned tubes has a tubular body (17) and surface-enlarging elements present on the latter which consist of a relatively large number of fins (18) which are welded on the outside of the body (17) and project outwards from the latter. The fins (18), and also the body (17), are produced from a carbon steel. With the aim of reducing the risk of the formation of cracks on the weld (welding) groove between the fins (18) and the tubular body (17), or in the parts of the fins (18) adjacent to the body (17), the carbon content of the material used to produce the fins is substantially lower than the carbon content of the material used to produce the tubular body (17).

<CLAIMS>
A finned tube heat exchanger (16), having a tubular 
body (17) and surface-increasing elements provided 

thereon which comprise a large number of fins (18) 
welded to the outside of the body (17) and directed 

outwardly therefrom, wherein both the entire fins (18) 
and also the body (17) are made from carbon steel, 

characterised in that the fins (18) are made from a 
carbon steel having a significantly lower carbon content 

that the carbon content of the carbon steel used for 
making the tubular body (17). 
A finned tube heat exchanger according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the fins (18) are made from a 

carbon steel having a maximum carbon content of 0.05%. 
A finned tube heat exchanger according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the fins (18) are made from a 

carbon steel having a carbon content of approximately 
0.03%.
