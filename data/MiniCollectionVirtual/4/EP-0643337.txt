<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for a
two-component-type magnetic developing agent having
excellent spent resistance. More specifically, the
invention relates to a toner which contains no charge
control agent, does not scatter during the developing,
enables the image to be efficiently transferred, makes
it possible to form image of a high density, and helps
extend the life of the toner and the carrier.A so-called two-component-type magnetic developing
agent has been extensively used for developing
electrostatic charge image formed on an
electrophotosensitive material.The two-component-type magnetic developing agent
comprises a composition of a magnetic carrier of an iron
powder or ferrite particles and an electroscopic toner
composed of a coloring resin composition. To carry out
the developing, the magnetic carrier and the toner are
mixed together to electrically charge the toner
particles to a predetermined polarity, the mixture is
carried to the photosensitive material in the form of a
magnetic brush, the surface of the photosensitive
material is rubbed by the magnetic brush, and the
electrically charged toner is adsorbed and held by the
charge image on the surface of the photosensitive
material to form a visible image.A charge control agent is usually contained in the
toner particles in order to control the polarity of the
toner gains by frictional charging. A negative charge 
control agent such as a metal-containing complex salt dyestuff
or a metal complex of oxycarboxylic acid is used for the
negatively-charged toner (e.g., see Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Publication No. 67268/1991), and a positive charge control
agent such as an oil-soluble dyestuff like Nigrosine or an
amine control agent is used for the positively-charged toner
(e.g., see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
106249/1981).It has long been known to use a magnetic toner as a toner
for the two-component-type magnetic developing agent. For
instance, the above Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
106249/1981 and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
162563/1984 disclose a magnetic powder-containing toner which
contains a magnetic powder therein. The above Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Publication No. 67268/1991 discloses a magnetic
powder-carrying toner obtained by adding and mixing a silica
powder and a magnetic powder to the toner.EP-A-0 407 604 discloses a two-component toner comprising
an electric charge controlling resin contained in a suspension-polymerised
binding resin.EP-A-0 317 667 discloses positively
