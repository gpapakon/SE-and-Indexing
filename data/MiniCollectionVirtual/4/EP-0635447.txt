<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for 
regulation of the tapering of the side edges of a 
package of yarn in a textile winding apparatus, wherein 
a package of yarn is provided on a spool, making the 
latter to rotate around its own longitudinal axis, 
while at least a yarn guide member, moving reciprocally 
and parallel to said longitudinal axis of the spool, 
distributes said yarn onto the spool itself. In winding apparatus known hitherto, the tapering 
of the side edges of the package of yarn, in other 
words the conicity of said side edges, is achieved by 
gradually shortening the stroke of the yarn guide 
member as the deposit of yarn on the spool increases. Currently, this variation in the stroke of the 
yarn guide members can be obtained by using a single 
cam contour attached to the axis of the spool-holder 
arm which, via a suitable transmission mechanism, 
drives the variation of the stroke of the yarn guide 
members. With this known device, when it is necessary  
 
to vary the profile of the side edge of the package of 
yarn, the cam for driving the stroke of the yarn guide 
member has to be replaced. It is therefore necessary to 
stop the machine and replace said cam with another cam 
having a more suitable contour for the type of work in 
progress. This change over obviously involves costs, both due to 
the use of labour to perform said operation of 
replacing the cam, and due to the non production 
caused by the down time of the machine for performing 
the change of the cam. Italian patent application No83415/90 (=ITB-01242652) solves the 
previous problem by setting up a cam having different 
contours for different taperings of the side edges of 
the package of yarn. Said contours are formed in a 
series along a same circumferential line of the cam, 
i.e. on the edge of a same discoidal element forming 
the cam. The median lines of all said contours of the 
cam lie on the same plane. In this way the operation 
of removing and replacing the drive cam contour is made 
easier. In fact it is sufficient to rotate the 
discoidal element and place the required cam contour in 
the working position. However, the use of this type of 
drive cam has disadvantages; it is in fact necessary in 
this case also to disengage the discoidal element which  
 
holds the cam contours from the spool-holder arm to make 
it rotate, position and re-engage it in the required 
working position. These operations also require a 
certain working time by staff and the machine has to be 
stopped. Moreover this cam
