<ABSTRACT>
A branch pipe lining method ensures a reliable 
air-tight connection between a branch pipe liner bag (4) 

and a fluid pressure sealing nozzle (7) with a simple 
structure so that the branch pipe liner bag can be 

inserted into a branch pipe (2) without fail. A branch 
pipe liner bag (4) impregnated with a hardenable resin 

and having a flange (4A) at one end thereof is used for 
the branch pipe repair. The flange of the branch pipe 

liner bag is folded out to be mounted to a fluid 
pressure sealing nozzle (7). A close contact between 

the flange and the fluid pressure sealing nozzle is held 
by vacuum pressure. The branch pipe liner bag is then 

everted and inserted from a main pipe (1) into a branch 
pipe (2) toward the ground by fluid pressure. The 

branch pipe liner bag is pressed onto the inner wall of 
the branch pipe by fluid pres
sure, and the hardenable 
resin impregnated in the branch pipe liner bag is 

hardened while the bag itself is kept pressed onto the 
inner wall of the branch pipe. In this manner, since an 

air-tight connection between the branch pipe liner bag 
and the fluid pressure sealing nozzle can be reliably 

provided by vacuum pressure, a high sealability is 
ensured between them with a simple structure, whereby 

the branch pipe liner bag is reliably inserted into the 
branch pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pipe lining techniques, and
more particularly to a method of lining or repairing an aged or
defective branch pipe which is conducted by using a pipe liner bag.When an underground pipe, such as a pipeline or passageway,
becomes defective or too old to perform properly, the pipe is
repaired and restored without digging the earth to expose the
pipe and disassembling the sections of the pipe. This non-digging
method of repairing an underground pipe has been known and
practiced commonly in the field of civil engineering. Typically,
the method is disclosed by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 60-242038 (EP-A-0 155 406).According to the method described in the above-mentioned
publication, the pipe repair method comprises inserting a
sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag into the pipe to be
repaired by means of a pressurized fluid, such as air or water. The
tubular liner bag is made of a flexible resin-absorbent material
impregnated with a thermosetting resin, and has its outer surface
covered with an impermeable plastic film.More particularly, according to the publication, the tubular
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, and then the closed
end of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open
end of the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked 
anchored at the end of the defective or old pipe in a manner
such that the wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly
covers and closes the pipe end; a portion of the liner is pushed
into the pipe; then, pressurized fluid is applied to the
portion of the tubular liner such that the fluid urges the tubular
liner to enter the pipe. Since one end of the tubular liner is
hoocked at the end of the pipe, it remains there while the rest of
the flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds deeper
in the pipe. (Hereinafter, this manner of procedure shall be
called "everting".) When the entire length of the tubular liner
bag is everted (i.e., turned inside out) into the pipe, the
control rope holds the closed end of the tubular liner bag to
thereby control the length of the tubular liner in the pipe.
Then, the everted tubular liner is pressed against the inner wall
of the pipe by the pressurized fluid, and the tubular flexible
liner is hardened as the thermosetting resin impregnated in the
liner is heated, which is effected by heating the fluid filling
the tubular liner bag by means of hot steam, etc. It is

<CLAIMS>
A method of lining a branch pipe (2) using a branch
pipe liner bag (4) impregnated with a hardenable resin

and having a flange (4A) at one end thereof, comprising
the steps of:


arranging said flange (4A) to mount the same to a
fluid pressure sealing nozzle (7);
maintaining close airtight contact between said flange (4A)
and said fluid pressure sealing nozzle (7) ;
everting said branch pipe liner bag (4) and
inserting the same from a main pipe (1) into a branch

pipe (2) toward the ground by fluid pressure;
pressing said branch pipe liner bag (4) onto the

inner wall of said branch pipe (2) by fluid pressure; and
hardening said hardenable resin impregnated in said
branch pipe liner bag (4) which is kept pressed onto the

inner wall of said branch pipe (2), characterised in that
the close airtight contact is maintained by vacuum pressure.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that said fluid pressure sealing nozzle (7) has a

contact surface formed with an annular groove (11), and
said annular groove is evacuated to maintain the close

contact between said flange (4A) and said fluid pressure
sealing nozzle (7) by vacuum pressure.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a packing (12) is attached on a contact surface

of said fluid pressure sealing nozzle (7).
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,

in said branch pipe liner bag (4) is a thermosetting

resin, and said hardening step includes heating said
hardenable resin to harden the same.

heating said branch pipe liner bag (4) by the hot
