<ABSTRACT>
Novel fibre optic telephone loop networks are disclosed. In the networks, single mode fibre optics are used for feeder and distribution segments of the loop but multimode fibre optics are used for the drops. The use of the multimode fibre optics has permitted the use of less costly optoelectronic devices. Surface light emitting diodes are such economical but reliable parts. Fibre service terminals located near subscriber premises convert single mode operation to the multimode operation. The networks are relatively easy to install and upgrade and are very economically competitive with other known FTTC and FTTH schemes. In a further embodiment, the fibre service terminals have microprocessor control to reroute signals via redundant single mode connections to central switching office in the event of a fault in single mode fibres.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to a novel telephone 
loop network. In particular, it is directed to a telephone loop network in 
which single mode optic fibres and multimode optic fibres are used at 
specific segments of the telephone loop. Together with the use of more 
economical outside plant elements, the invention realizes a cost effective 
fibre-in-the-loop deployment which also possesses a good future upgrading 
capability of the communication services. The invention also realizes 
network systems which have a good survivability against faults due to 
accident or other cause . The fibre optic transmission technology has matured from its 
embryonic field trial status to the position of market where now it 
dominates in the long-haul transmission arena. The fibre optic has 
recently penetrated into the feeder portion of the local loop. This 
technological evolution is continuing into the distribution portion of the 
loop and then further into the drops to individual homes. The primary 
reason for this change is that fibre optics has become the most economical 
way to meet customer needs. As discussed in "What Cost Local Loop?" by C. Nelson in 
Telephony, Oct. 29, 1990, pp 38-42, there are many factors to consider when 
comparing the economics of copper and fibre in the loop. Although the 
installed first cost of fully loaded systems is probably the single most visible 
factor, other variables such as depreciation, maintenance costs and the 
ability to provide service to initial residents-while deferring the cost of 
providing service to future residents-can have major effects on the 
economics of the competing systems. These life-cycle costs are the most 
difficult to analyze because they vary so dramatically based on the specifics 
of the neighbourhood under consideration.  
 The telephone companies at the same time must face another 
problem of providing cost-effective POTS (plain old telephone service) 
today using a system that will be able to carry tomorrow's enhanced 
services. Any FITL (fibre-in-the-loop) system deployed today must have 
this capability. Thus Bellcore (Bell Communications Research Ltd) lists the 
three key requirements of such a system. First, it must have only two fibres 
per pedestal. Second, the upgrade plan must provide for the simultaneous 
transmission of telephony, AM video and broadband integrated services 
digital network (BISDN) offerings in any mix at the pedestal. Finally, 
upgrading one subscriber interface unit should not affect customer service
