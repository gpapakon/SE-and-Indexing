<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises a turbine lying underwater, 
propelling water under pressure, where the water jet 

generated can be directed with a hose (14) toward the desired 
bodily area. 
The turbine is driven by a motor located outside the 
water-containing vessel or bath-tub, the said motor 

transmitting motion through a resilient shaft (3) that is 
located in and protected by a cable-like sheath. 
The apparatus is characteristically portable and its 
electric parts lie out of contact with water. 

When not in use the unit (2) containing the turbine can be placed inside 
a cavity (7) defined between side extensions (6) of the unit (1) 

containing the motor, for convenient storage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a portable hydromassage 
apparatus conceived and designed to be useful in any kind 
of suitable vessel in which the user can take a bath. To 
this end the portable apparatus is provided to be 
disposed in any bath-tub, whence it can be moved from one 
place to another, taking up little space and being 
conveniently versatile over known apparatus used to this 
end. A great many kinds of bath-tubs are currently in the 
market fitted with means with which the water contained 
in the bath-tub is provided with movement and bubbles for 
the user to benefit from a hydromassage. Otherwise, there are independent apparatus that are 
mounted fixed and that are designed to propel water into 
the bath-tub, thereby for the massage function to be 
carried out with pressure water. There are other apparatus that, being fitted with a 
shell and a motor that must be located outside the bath-tub, 
send compressed air to a sort of mat that will lie 
on the bottom of the bath-tub, which mat has a large 
number of holes through which the air leaves and 
consequently generates bubbles, whence the hydromassage 
function.  In some cases, the apparatus are fixed, as 
aforesaid, and otherwise, being portable, take up quite 
some space and are difficult to move from one place to 
another. The apparatus subject hereof has been designed to 
fully solve the above problems, being a portable 
apparatus that carries out the hydromassage function and 
relies on a turbine lying underwater, propelling the same 
under pressure, and wherein the water jet generated can 
be directed with a hose toward the desired bodily area. The turbine is driven by a motor placed outside the 
vessel or bath-tub containing the water, and the said 
motor transmits the movement by a resilient shaft that is 
housed in and protected by a cable-like sheath. In short, the apparatus subject hereof, in addition 
to being portable, is particular in being adaptable to 
any water-containing vessel or bath-tub. In addition, the apparatus, defined by two interrelated 
units or parts, is particular in that the part or 
unit in which the respective motor is mounted conforms a 
sort of cavity where the other unit, being the turbine, 
can be disposed, one part fitting into the other and the 
assembly as a whole being compacted when not in use, 
taking up very little space. The apparatus of the invention is further particular 
in that the electric part, viz. the part where the motor 
is lodged, is not in contact with the water and hence the 
chances of

<CLAIMS>
1.- A portable hydromassage apparatus, characterised 
in comprising two units forming an assembly in which the 

units can be located with one of them housed in the 
other's cavity when the apparatus is in storage, or else 

be separated when in use, but functionally associated to 
each other, one such unit being a shell inside which 

there is an electric drive motor, from which a turbine 
mounted inside the second unit is driven, transmission 

between both units taking place through a resilient 
sheathed and entirely watertight shaft, all so that the 

said second unit submerged in the water contained in the 
vessel or bath-tub draws in and hence propels water to 

provide the respective hydromassage effect. 
2.- A portable hydromassage apparatus, as in claim 
1, characterised in that the shell in the first unit is 

laterally provided with extensions defining the relevant 
cavity where the second unit is housed, for storage of 

the assembly. 
3.- A portable hydromassage apparatus, as in the 
above claims, characterised in that the unit carrying the 

turbine is provided on its lower base with a wide hole or 
window for water to enter, which hole or window can be 

adjusted with a hand-driven control provided on a 
suitable area or position of the shell of such unit. 
4.- A portable hydromassage apparatus, as in the 
above claims, characterised in that the unit carrying the 

turbine is provided on its rear face with suction pads 
that allow the said unit to be fixed to the surface of 

the wall of a water-containing bath-tub or vessel in 
which the said unit is submerged, the outlet mouth for 

 
water propelled by such turbine being further provided to 

be able to have a hose ending in a nozzle coupled, to 
direct the water jet toward a particular area or part of 

the user's body.
