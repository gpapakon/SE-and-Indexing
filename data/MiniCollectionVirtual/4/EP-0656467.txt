<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to turbocharger control means 
and more particularly, but not exclusively, to means for 
the control of turbochargers for internal combustion 
engines such as reciprocating piston diesel engines. It is known to control the temperature of charge air 
entering a reciprocating piston diesel engine from an 
exhaust gas turbocharger, by passing the charge air first 
through an intercooler or radiator and to provide a by-pass 
which avoids the intercooler or radiator to prevent 
overcooling of the charge air in certain operating 
conditions, e.g. on start-up and at low ambient 
temperatures. It is known (e.g. from GB-A-1 255 956) for the by-pass to be controlled 
by means of a valve, e.g. a flap valve, under the operation 
of an actuator which is in turn controlled by a temperature 
sensor disposed in the engine inlet. This arrangement is 
costly and not easily adaptable to the needs of smaller 
engines, e.g. in commercial trucks. It is an object of the invention to provide valve 
means for controlling the intercooler radiator by-pass from 
an exhaust gas turbocharger to an engine inlet, which is 
simple and therefore inexpensive compared to the known 
control means. According to the invention, there is provided valve 
means for controlling an intercooler radiator by-pass 
comprising a valve for controlling flow of charge air 
through the by-pass and thermostatic means capable of  
 
sensing the charge air temperature at or near the engine 
inlet and causing the valve to open when the charge air 
temperature is low, the valve means being as described in claim 1. The valve means may be generally of the kind used for 
controlling the liquid coolant temperature of an internal 
combustion engine, ie a thermostatic valve. In the present 
case however it is preferred that the thermostatic valve 
works in the reverse sense to that normally found in an 
engine cooling system so that, should the valve fail, it 
fails safe, that is to say with the valve open. In an embodiment 
the 
temperature sensing means and valve actuating means 
comprises a wax-filled bulb. The valve member may be tubular or disc-like and may  
 
be arranged for axial movement on the valve body. The valve means preferably comprises a valve housing 
forming one end of the by-pass and in which the valve is 
mounted, the housing being formed with means, eg a shoulder 
or end face, against which the valve member can abut to 
close the by-pass. Preferably the housing forms the down-stream 
end of the by-pass whereby the
