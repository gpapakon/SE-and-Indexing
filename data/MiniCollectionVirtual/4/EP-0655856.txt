<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides an image processing 
system comprising devices for producing image 

signals by scanning an original image, process 
units for generating video signals by processing the 

image signals, detector for detecting the 
coordinates of the original image and controller 

for storing the coordinate signals from the detecting 
means and for controlling the process units 

according to thus stored signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing system.Conventionally the performance of a copier has
been limited to faithful reproduction of an original
or magnification or reduction of the original image
with a fixed ratio.Such copier basically functions by illuminating
the original with a light source such as a fluorescent
lamp or a tungsten lamp, projecting the reflected
light from said original through lenses and mirrors
onto a photosensitive member charged in advance thereby
forming an electrostatic latent image thereon, and
applying developer onto said photosensitive member to
obtain a visible image. Consequently the image
forming process is conducted all under mechanical
control, and the magnification or reduction of the
original image is achieved through a relative change
between the lens movement and the original scanning
speed. The range of multiple functions in such
conventional copier is inevitably limited, since such
lens movement or speed change has a certain physical  
limit. It has also been difficult to arbitrarily move
the image position on the copy sheet, and such movement
has been considerably limited.Also there is proposed a copier in which the
original image is once stored in a memory and then
read as image data for making a print, but such
apparatus is quite unsatisfactory as a copier since an
extremely long time is required from the start of image
scanning to the completion of printing operation.Besides the conventional copier is often unable
to produce a satisfactory image quality from an
original with a dark background, and is unable to
faithfully reproduce certain originals such as photographs.Furthermore, in copying with a modified size
different from the original size, the selection of
direction of original or of image magnification
becomes quite cumbersome with the increase in the sizes
of copy sheets and of originals.Furthermore, in book copying, it is often
difficult to place the book to be copied on an exact
position on the platen, and is therefore difficult to
obtain the copied image on a desired position of the
copy sheet. Also in such book copying mode, the image
quality is inevitably deteriorated since shadows are
formed around the book and reproduced on the copy.
Also in case of copying both pages at left and at 
right of an open book, the book has to be moved at
each copying operation.EP-A-0 051 291 discloses a document filing system which can also provide a hard
copy. Part of a document image can be designated and displayed at a cursor over
the document
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An image processing apparatus comprising:

means 
(A)
 for scanning an original document;
means 
(108)
 for designating an arbitrary area of the original document; and
means 
(B)
 for reproducing, on a material, an image
within the designated arbitrary area of the original document

scanned by said scanning means 
(A)
,

   
characterized in that
means 
(614)
 are provided for determining a moving
coordinate 
(TXM, TYM)
 on the basis of a position of the
designated arbitrary area in the original document and the

size of the material
and
means 
(1)
 are provided for controlling
the reproducing

operation of said reproducing means 
(B)
 in accordance with
the determined moving coordinate 
(TXM, TYM)

reproducing means 
(B)
 reproduces the image within the
designated arbitrary area of the original at the center of

the material.

further comprising means 
(90, 91)
 for masking the scanned
image of the original document outside the designated

arbitrary area.
An image processing apparatus according to claim 1,
further comprising means 
(108)
 for instructing a reproducing 
position of the image within the designated arbitrary area of

the original on the material,

   wherein
the controlling means 
(614)
 is adapted to operate such that in a first mode 
(MANUAL SHIFT; Fig. 15J)
, it controls said reproducing means 
(B)

in accordance with the reproducing position instructed by
said instructing means 
(108)
 so as to reproduce the image
within the designated arbitrary area of the original at the

reproducing position instructed by said instructing means

(108)
, and the controlling means is adapted to operate such that in a second mode 
(AUTO; Fig. 15J)
,
it controls said reproducing means 
(B)

regardless of the instruction by said instructing means (108)
so as to reproduce the image within the designated arbitrary

area of the original at the center of the material.
