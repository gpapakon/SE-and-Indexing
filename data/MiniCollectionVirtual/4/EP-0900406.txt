<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid crystal displays comprising polyimide angularity enhancement layers
which enhance the viewing angle of liquid crystal displays. Novel
polyimide copolymers are disclosed. Also, multilayer angularity enhancement
constructions comprising polyimides are disclosed.Negative birefringent films greatly enhance the image quality of liquid
crystal displays viewed at off-normal angles by compensating for image degradation
due to "natural" net positive birefringence of the liquid crystal materials. Typically,
negative birefringent films have been prepared by precision stretching of polymer
films or by precisely controlled vapor deposition of thin ceramic layers. However,
practicioners have found that precise control of film stretching in order to exactly
control the resulting birefringence is difficult, and that ceramic films can be unstable
and are not practical for large surface areas.Non-stretched negative birefringent polyimide films are known. U. S.
Patent No. 5,344,916 describes polyimide films prepared from benzene dianhydrides
and/or bis(benzene)dianhydrides and monoaromatic and/or polyaromatic diamines.
While the polyimides are generally soluble, some polyimides are soluble only in
solvents that are incompatible with certain useful liquid crystal polymeric substrates
onto which the polyimides could be coated. The monoaromatic and/or
polyaromatic diamines are linked benzeneamine compounds (benzidine derivatives,
bis(4-aminophenyl)methane derivatives, 2,2-bis(4-aminophenyl)propane derivatives,
and the like) rather than polyaromatic diamines such as 9,9-bis(4-aminophenyl)fluorenes.
Many linked benzeneamines must be handled with care due
to their suspected human toxicity. Homopolymers of 9,9-bis(4-aminophenyl)fluorenes and aromatic
dicarboxylic acid dianhydrides are known. U. S. Patent No. 4,897,092 describes
the preparation and properties of polyimide membranes prepared from the
homopolymers, the membranes being useful for gas separations. The membranes
are described as being approximately ten times the thickness of layers useful in
liquid crystal displays, and optical properties of the membranes are not elucidated.
No copolymers of 9,9-bis(4-aminophenyl)fluorenes and aromatic dicarboxylic acid
dianhydrides with a non-fluorenyl aromatic diamines are described. French patent
application number 2,650,829 discloses a number of possible uses for
homopolymers of 9,9-bis(4-aminophenyl)fluorenes and aromatic dicarboxylic acid
dianhydrides, including alignment films for liquid crystal
