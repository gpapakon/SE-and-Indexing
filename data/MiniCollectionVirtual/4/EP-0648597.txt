<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to vary the inherent frequency of a high-speed cutting press with regard to the number of strokes of the latter, at least one linear spring (1) is provided which is situated parallel to the crank mechanism between the press frame (10) and the slide (12) and one end part (13) of which is connected to the slide (12) by means of a lever (8) and the other end part of which is connected to the press frame (10) at a fixed point (2), the lever (8) having two arms and being mounted in a lever bearing point (11) and the lever bearing point (11) being displaceable in the press frame (10) to extend the lever (8).

<CLAIMS>
Press, in particular high-speed cutting press,
having a frame and at least one ram which is guided

linearly in said frame and can be moved by means of a
crank or similar drive means, and having at least one

linear spring (1), which is located between the press
frame (10) and ram (12), parallel to the crank drive,

and of which one end part (13) is connected to the ram
(12) via a lever (8) and the other end part is

connected to the press frame (10) at a fixed point (2),
characterized in that the lever (8) is designed to have

two arms and is mounted at a lever bearing point (11),
and the lever bearing point (11) can be displaced in

the press frame (10), in extension of the lever (8).
Press according to Claim 1, characterized by
displaceability of the lever bearing point (11) into

the region (7) of the lever (8) which is in the
vicinity of the linear spring (1), the spring-side

region (7), the spring-side lever point (7) not being
subjected to any deflection in the event of ram-side

deflection.
Press according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the linear spring (1) is a

torsion rod with a link lever (4).
