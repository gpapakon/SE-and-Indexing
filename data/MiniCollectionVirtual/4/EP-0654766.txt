<ABSTRACT>
Input image data define an input image set that shows a graphical feature (12,14) 
and editing marks (22,24,26,28) indicating an editing operation to be performed on the 

graphical feature (12,14). The input image data are used to obtain operation category data 
(30) indicating whether the editing operation would translate the graphical feature so that it is 

centered at a different position (34) within the input image set. The operation category data 
(30) are used to obtain output image data defining an output image that includes an edited 

version of the input image set. The output image shows the graphical feature centered at a 
different position only if the operation category data so indicate. The input image set can 

include an original image on an original sheet (10) showing the graphical feature and an 
overlay image on a transparent overlay (20) showing the editing marks (22,24,26,28). The 

editing marks can form a node-link structure with the graphical feature. If the structure is a 
directed graph, it can indicate an editing operation that would translate the graphical feature 

to be centered at a different position, such as a simple translation to a new position, a 
translation with scaling or rotation, or a replacement operation. If the structure is an 

undirected graph, it can indicate an editing operation that would not translate the graphical 
feature, such as a delete operation or a scale or rotate operation. A rectangle with a dot inside 

it can indicate scaling or rotation. A cross can indicate deletion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of analyzing data defining an image and,
more particularly, to techniques for analyzing marks indicating an editing operation.Suenaga, Y., "A Facsimile Based Text Editor Using Handwritten Mark Recognition,"
IJCAI-79, Proceedings of the Sixth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
Tokyo, August 20-23, 1979, Vol. 2, pp. 856-858, describes a facsimile based text editor using
handwritten mark recognition. Five kinds of marks are shown in Fig.1, including a delete mark
and a move mark."A facsimile-based graphics editing systems by auxiliary mark recognition" by Nagura M.
et al. (IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE

discloses a facsimile-based graphics editing system, which uses hand-written mark recognition.
First, a graphic subject given as a set of line drawings and characters hand-written
on a sheet of paper is input into a computer as a binary picture from a facsimile
transmitter. Auxiliary editing information is input into the computer as handwritten marks
prepared on a separate sheet of paper. Then the marks are recognized and used to
create a mark parameter list. Finally, a correct edited copy of the graphics is constructed
by picture processing based on the graphic comments and is output a facsimile receiver."A System for Recognition and Description of Graphics" by Rangachar Kasturi et al.

system for automatic recognition and description of graphical primitives and their interconnections
in a mixed text-graphics image. The input to the system is a high resolution
binary image. The objective of this document is to obtain a succinct description of the
content of the graphics. First, text strings are separated from graphics. Then, in the
graphics part, loops, lines as well as hatching and filling patterns are recognized. The
output is presented in tables."The Chicago Manual of Style" (14th Edition 1993 (Sep 10), THE UNIVERSITY OF

editing marks of proofreaders including "move right", "move left", "center",
"move up" and "move down". It is the object of this invention to provide a method, a machine and an article of manufacture
for editing an image on the basis of more flexible editing marks.This object is
