end bracket (207) for supporting the fan motor (M), and a 

circuit board (P) equipped with heat generation elements 
(Q1-Q6) and disposed in opposition to the end bracket (207), 

wherein the heat generation elements (Q1-Q6) are disposed in a 
peripheral portion of the circuit board (P); a heat release 

surface (E) of each heat generation element (Q1-Q6) is in 
contact with the end bracket (207); elastic members (233) are 

disposed between the end bracket (207) and the respective heat 
generation elements (Q1-Q6); and clamping members (234) made of 

generally U-shaped elastic pieces are provided to clamp the end 
bracket (207) and the circuit board (P) so that the heat 

release surfaces (E) of the heat generation elements (Q1-Q6) 
are held in close contact with the end bracket (207).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electric rotary 
machines such as electric motors and electric generators, 
and a method for producing the electric rotary machines. Conventionally, electric rotary machines such as 
electric motors, for example, have been manufactured as 
units. For this reason, an indoor unit of an air conditioner, 
for example, requires a space for receiving a 
separate motor such as an alternating-current induction 
motor to drive a cross-flow fan in the indoor unit. As a 
result, the indoor unit is apt to be of a large size. In 
other words, separate electric rotary machines cause apparatuses 
for accommodating the rotary machines to be large-sized. Recently, direct current (DC) brushless motors 
have been adopted to reduce the size of apparatuses. An 
apparatus adopting a DC brushless motor is disclosed in the 
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication No. 
64-41696. In the apparatus, a generally cup-shaped casing 
for a rotor in the DC brushless motor is connected to a side 
plate of a fan rotor of a cross-flow fan, and a permanent 
magnet which is fitted along an inner peripheral surface of 
the casing surrounds a stator. Conventionally, the permanent magnet is produced 
by the following method. First, a molded piece of a desired 
shape is made by sintering a magnetic material such as  
 
ferrite. Then, the molded piece is finished so that it has 
a shape to fit the inner circumferential surface of the 
casing. The finished molded piece is then placed in the 
casing. The molded piece of such magnetic material is very 
hard and fragile. For this reason, generally, an abrasive 
finishing is applied to the molded piece as a finishing 
method. In this case, the production cost becomes high. In 
addition, it is not easy to make holes in the molded piece 
for fixing the molded piece to the casing. Therefore, in 
order to mount the molded piece to the casing, separate 
articles to help the fixing are required, or an adhesive-assembly 
is done. This makes the assembly operation complicated 
and troublesome. An object of the present invenion is, in a 
fan apparatus wherein a circuit board equipped with heat 
generation elements such as power transistors is mounted to 
an end bracket by means of clips, to lessen the number of 
clips and to improve heat release efficiency of the heat 
generation elements. In order to accomplish this object, in a fan 
apparatus having a fan motor, an end bracket for supporting 
the fan motor, and a circuit board equipped with heat 
generation
