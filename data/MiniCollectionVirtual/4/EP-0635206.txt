<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a construction for automatically 
milking animals, such as cows. The construction 

comprises a milking robot and floors, on which the animals 
are allowed to move about freely. In addition, the construction 

comprises a number of milking parlours which are also 
arranged as resting boxes and/or as feeding boxes, while 

furthermore there are provided means for removal of manure 
over the floors in two different directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction for
automatically milking animals, such as cows, comprising a
milking robot and floors, on which the animals are allowed to
move about freely.Such construction is known from EP-A-0 622 019.In the above construction, the animals are allowed
to move about freely. The droppings of the animals will be
spread over a major surface area of the construction. In the
construction this can give rise to a considerable emission of
ammonia, which is undesirable from environmental and hygienic
viewpoints. It is known per se to use dung scrapers to clean
the surface of the construction. In document FR-A-2 099 264
there is described and drawn a dung scraper which can be
moved along the floor of a shed in two directions by means of
a chain which is connected with an electric motor. The
scraper comprises a scraper blade which is moved along the
floor from one end of the shed to the other end of the shed,
where the collected mest is dropped into a receptacle. Such a
scraper have the disadvantage that a groof must be arranged
in the floor to put away the chain so that the chain forms no
obstacle for the animals. Another disadvantage of such a
scraper blade is that it collects all the manure over the
whole length of the shed which can result in that manure will
run over the scraper blade. Furthermore, the manure is taken
along the whole floor before it is dropped into a receptacle.The objective of the invention is to obviate these
drawbacks or to reduce it to a large extent. Therefore, the
construction according to the invention is characterized in
that the construction comprises a plurality of milking parlours
which are also arranged as resting boxes and/or feeding
boxes, while furthermore there is provided a cross conveyor
which is movable along the floors for removal of manure over
the floors in two different directions. Owing to the above 
facilities, the manure and/or urine can be rapidly carried
off, so that the emission of ammonia is kept down to a
minimum and both the environment and the health of the
animals are burdened to a lesser degree. According to a
further feature of the invention, the floor is provided with
a coating preventing ammonia and ammonia-containing
substances from penetrating thereinto.According to still another feature of the
invention, the construction comprises a space where the
animals are allowed to move about freely, comprising a
milking and resting place having an inclined floor, and also
a loafing area provided with an equally inclined floor.

of milking parlours which are also arranged as resting boxes
(6) and/or feeding boxes, while furthermore there is provided

a cross conveyor (11) which is movable along the floors (3)
for removal of manure over the floors (3) in two different

directions (56, 57).
A construction according to claim 1, characterized
in that the floor (3) is provided with a coating preventing

ammonia and ammonia-containing substances from penetrating
thereinto.
A construction according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the space where the animals are allowed

to move about freely comprises a milking and resting place
having an inclined floor (3), and/or a loafing area (10)

provided with an inclined floor (3).
A construction according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a manure channel (7)

for the removal of manure and/or urine is provided behind a
milking box or a feeding box.
A construction according to claim 4, characterized
in that in the manure channel (7) there is provided a

longitudinal conveyor (8), through which the manure in the
manure channel (7) can be moved.
A construction according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that it comprises a

loafing passage (10) for the animals, while the cross
conveyor (11) for manure removal is arranged transversely to

the loafing passage (10).

characterized in that the conveyor chain (47) is driven by an

electric motor (55).
A construction according to claim 7, 8 or 9,
characterized in that the conveyor
 chain (47) is capable of
being driven in two opposite directions of motion.
A construction according to any one of claims 6 to
10, characterized in that the cross conveyor (11) is
