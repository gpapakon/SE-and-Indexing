<ABSTRACT>
Television signal processing apparatus, including, particularly, a line doubler, a television standards converter, a television slow motion processor and a video information compressor incorporates means for detecting twenty-five frame per second motion picture film sources in 50 Hz television signals, such as PAL, SECAM, 50 Hz NTSC, 50 Hz HDTV and 50 Hz monochrome television signals. In a first embodiment, the detection scheme looks for differences in motion between a field and the previous field, on one hand, and between the same field and the subsequent field, on the other hand. In a second embodiment, the detection scheme compares differences in motion between the two pairs of fields of the same polarity in adjacent frames. In both embodiments, the detection schemes include signal treatment, such as filtering, thresholds and signal integration in order to assure that the scheme responds to true picture motion rather than noise or dropouts in the television signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to television signal processing methods and apparatus.
More particularly, the present invention relates to television signal processing apparatus
and related methods, including, particularly, a line doubler, a television standards
converter, a television slow motion processor and a video information compressor, wherein
the apparatus and related methods incorporate means for detecting twenty-five frame per
second motion picture film sources in 50 Hz television signals, such as PAL, SECAM, 50
Hz NTSC, 50 Hz HDTV and 50 Hz monochrome television signals.In accordance with US-PS 4,876,976, it is known to detect that a 60 Hz NTSC
television signal has as its source a 24 frame/second motion picture film. A 24
frame/second film is applied to and synchronized with 60 Hz NTSC video by using a 3-2
film pulldown ratio such that three video fields come from one film frame and the
subsequent two video fields come from the next film frame (e.g., AABBBCCDDDEE,
etc., where "A," "B," etc. are successive film frames). Video fields of the same parity in
adjacent video frames are compared. When motion is present, a distinctive repeating
pattern is obtained only if the video source is film (i.e., 1101111011, etc., where "1"
indicates motion an "0" indicates no motion). EP-A-0 567 072 shows another method
for detecting signals originating from film sources by comparing three adjacent pixels.US-PS 4,982,280 discloses an arrangement for detecting a 30 Hz progressive scan
source, which may be a video camera or film, in a 60 Hz progressively scanned non-interlaced
television system. In the presence of motion from frame-to-frame within the 30
Hz progressively scanned video image sequences, when the video sequences in adjacent
video fields are compared a 010101, etc. pattern results, indicating a 30 Hz progressively
scanned source. Comparison of every second video field, to yield a 111111, etc., pattern,
further confirms the 30 Hz progressive scan source. In order to operate, the arrangement
relies on the spatial coincidence of pixels in the successive identical pairs of fields of the
progressive scan television signal. US-PS 4,768,092 is directed to line doubling of an interlaced television signal, such
as an NTSC signal. In creating and selecting interpolated signals, motion in adjacent fields
is detected.In 50 Hz television systems, the video field rate (25 Hz) is the same as the motion
picture film frame rate of 25 frames/second, which is speeded up from 24 frames/second in
order to achieve
