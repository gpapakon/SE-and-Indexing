<ABSTRACT>
In order to divide an analyzing region in a 
semiconductor device into a plurality of fractional 

elements of a predetermined configuration, the 
analyzing region is initially divided into an arbitrary 

number of the fractional elements. With respect to a 
newly added nodal point, the fractional elements 

enclosing the new nodal point within a circumscribing 
range thereof are extracted as objective fractional 

elements for further division. Among the extracted 
fractional elements, specific fractional element having 

the perimetric fraction located within a predetermined 
modifying the perimeter of the fractional element group 

consisted of the extracted fractional elements. The 
fractional elements are re-establishes on the basis of 

the modified perimeter and the new nodal point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
method and a system for dividing a region to be
analyzed (analyzing region) of a semiconductor device
in a device simulation technology. More specifically,
the invention relates to a method and a system for
dividing an analyzing region into tetrahedral
fractional regions.In fabrication of semiconductor device,
simulation has been performed employing a device
simulator which calculates physical amount in the
semiconductor device using a computer and deriving
electric characteristics, such as terminal current,
threshold voltage and so forth of a transistor. Upon
performing optimization of the transistor for attaining
optimal electric characteristics of the semiconductor
device, it can significantly save expense and period by
employing the device simulator in comparison with
experimentally fabricating actual LSI. Also, since the
physical amount in the semiconductor device is
calculated in the device simulator, it is possible to
check behavior of electron and hole within the 
semiconductor. Therefore, it becomes possible to use
it for clearing up the cause of impact ionizing
phenomenon which causes problem in fine MOSFET.In the device simulator, in order to obtain
the physical amount within the semiconductor
transistor, separative variation within the
semiconductor is analyzed by solving a partial
differential equation, such as Poisson equation
expressing relationship between a potential and a
carrier concentration and current continuity equation
and so forth expressing relationship between a
potential and a carrier concentration. A method for
solving such partial differential equation, there is a
method disclosed in Dan, "Process Device Simulation
Technology" (edited: Sangyo Tosho), pp 113 to 122. In
the above-identified literature, there is disclosed a
method, in which the semiconductor device is divided
into small fractional regions for calculating the
partial differential equation in discrete manner. Also,
there is disclosed, as a method for discretion two-dimensional
section of the semiconductor, to divide a
transistor structure into a rectangular grid and define
current between each grid points. In such discretion
method employing the rectangular shaped fractional
elements, respective grid points are connected to
adjacent grid points by grid lines, as shown in Fig.
14. In the solution of the partial differential 
equation set forth above, a section is defined by an
intersection of perpendicular bisectors of the grid
lines, and the current between the grid
