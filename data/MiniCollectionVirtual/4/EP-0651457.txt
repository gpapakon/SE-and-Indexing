positive electrode, a negative electrode, a separator 
disposed between the positive electrode and the negative 

electrode and composed of a water absorbing material that 
absorbs and holds an electrolytic solution, an electrolytic 

solution supply member protrusively disposed at a lower 
edge of the positive electrode and the negative electrode 

and adapted for supplying the electrolytic solution to the 
separator, a spacer for covering an outer surface of the 

positive electrode and the negative electrode and forming 
an air layer on the front surface thereof, and a cover 

member for covering surfaces of the electrolytic solution 
supply member, the cover member having a blank portion that 

is at least a minimum opening portion for supplying the 
electrolytic solution to the electrolytic solution supply 

member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air cell 
constructed of a single cell or a plurality of connected 
cells, in particular, an air cell that is easily activated 
with electrolytic solution being poured thereto. The applicant of the present invention proposed an 
aggregated-cell type air cell in which a plurality of cells 
are assembled such that a positive 
electrode (a cathode in case of discharging electricity) of 
a cell and a negative electrode(an anode in case of 
discharging electricity) of the adjacent cell thereof are not 
shortcircuited through an electrolytic solution. This air 
cell was disclosed as Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication 
No. 2-265175. This air cell comprises a case which has a 
plurality of air ventilation windows, a plurality of cells 
which are accommodated in the case, and an electrolytic 
solution tank which is disposed at the bottom of the case, 
the electrolytic solution tank being filled with a water 
absorbing material that absorbs and holds an electrolytic 
solution and being partitioned into a plurality of tanks 
that correspond to the respective cells. This air cell is 
of nearly full-open type and the cells which receive an 
electrolytic solution from the respective tanks which are 
separated from each other are connected in series. Thus,  
 
even if the cells are connected in series, the liquid 
junction of the electrolytic solution does not take place. 
Consequently, the output voltage of the air cell can stably 
output an electric power. In brief, the partition provided 
at the bottom of the case allows that the leak current 
(liquid junction) can be prevented. However, when such a conventional air cell is used, 
water or salt water should be equally filled into the 
partitioned electrolytic solution tank with care not to 
overflow it from the partitions. Thus, the water filling 
operation is relatively troublesome. In addition, the 
process for providing the partitions at the bottom of the 
case and filling each of the partitions with the water 
absorbing material is complicated and thereby the 
production cost is increased. DE-A-1 912 382 describes metal-air cells providing a protruding felt layer beneath the lower edge of the electrodes for absorbing electrolyte contained in a vessel into which the cells are inserted. An object of the present invention is to solve the 
above-described problem and provide a single-cell type air 
cell(hereinafter also referred to as "a single cell") and 
an aggregated-cell type air cell(hereinafter also referred 
to as "an
</DESCRIPTION>
