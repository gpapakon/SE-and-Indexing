<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the processing of electrical
signals and in particular it concerns novel method and
apparatus for utilizing digital signal processing in
electronic theft detection.United States Patent No. 4,623,877 to Pierre F. Buckens
and assigned to the assignee of the present invention
discloses and claims methods and apparatus for
detecting the unauthorized taking of objects from a
protected area, such as a store. Articles taken from
the store must pass through an interrogation zone into
which electromagnetic interrogation energy is
continuously radiated. If, while an article is brought
through the interrogation zone, it has an active target
mounted thereon, the target will respond to the
electromagnetic interrogation energy in the zone and 
will produce disturbances of that energy in the from of
pulses having unique characteristics. These pulses are
detected by a receiver at the interrogation zone.The Buckens invention makes use of signal processing to
ascertain the average signal level in the interrogation
zone at different portions of each interrogation cycle
and to adjust the detection threshold level according
to that level so that targets may be detected in the
presence of other objects which may also produce
interfering signals.From document WO- A- 91/19278 an electronic article surveillance system
is known that detects a resonant marker or tag that is placed in an
electromagnetic field near the exit to a protected area. The detected
signal is applied to an adaptive threshold circuit and pulse detector that
detects the occurrence of a pulse indicating a perturbation of the
electromagnetic field. Each time a pulse is detected, a processor
determines when the next pulse should be received. Pulses received at
times other than the predicted time are ignored. If pulses are repeatedly
received at the predicted time, it is likely that a tag is present; however, if
the pulses continue to be received for more than a predetermined time
interval, they are likely caused by a spurious signal, and the threshold of
the adaptive threshold is increased so that the pulses are ignored.According to the invention there are provided 
method and apparatus for
detecting the presence, in an interrogation zone, of a
target capable of producing predetermined
electromagnetic disturbances which repeat at a first
predetermined frequency. These method and
apparatus comprise the steps of and apparatus for
receiving electromagnetic disturbances from said
interrogation zone and for producing corresponding
electrical

receiving electromagnetic disturbances from said interrogation zone (24) and producing
corresponding electrical signals;
detecting the magnitude of said electrical signals during successive time intervals, said
time intervals occuring at a second frequency which is a predetermined multiple of said

first predetermined frequency;
comparing to each other said detected magnitudes of said
electrical signals which occur in each of several corresponding time intervals in

successive cycles of said first predetermined frequency to produce an alarm (48); and
preventing the production of said alarm (48) when the variation among said detected
magnitudes in a predetermined number (N) of successive cycles exceeds a

predetermined value.
A method according to claim 1,

wherein, prior to said step of comparing said detected magnitudes, each magnitude is
adjusted by an amount corresponding to a weighted sum of preceding magnitudes which

occurred in corresponding time intervals in successive cycles of said first predetermined

of the square of said detected magnitudes.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

further comprising the steps of:

filtering from said electrical signals, frequency components above said second
