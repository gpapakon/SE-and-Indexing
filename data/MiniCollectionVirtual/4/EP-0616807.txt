<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel benzimidazole compounds, pharmaceutical
compositions thereof, and to a method of preparing such benzimidazole compounds.
The novel compounds are useful in the treatment of central nervous system diseases
and disorders, and for example in the treatment of convulsions, anxiety, sleep
disorders, and memory disorders.It is a well known fact, that specific sites in the central nervous system (the CNS) of a
living animal body, including a human, exhibit highly specific binding for
benzodiazepines such as for example diazepam. These binding sites are named
benzodiazepine receptors. Lately, several subtypes of such benzodiazepine receptors
have been isolated and described by techniques of modern molecular biology.
Numerous compounds belonging to different series of compounds having affinity for
the benzodiazepine receptors have been synthesized during the last three decades.
However, although the benzodiazepine receptor sites still are considered as very
attractive biological sites for interfering with the CNS to treat various disorders and
diseases, then nearly all previously synthesized compounds acting at these receptor
sites have failed during clinical development because of unacceptable side effects.
Therefore, there is still a large need to identify novel compounds interacting with the
benzodiazepine receptors.Tetrahedron, 31 (1975), 2163-70 describe the preparation of 3-(8'-quinolyl)-3H-pyrido[3.2-g]benzimidazole.
No pharmacological activity is disclosed.EP-A1-563 001 describes certain benzimidazole derivatives which are closely related
to the compounds of the invention. The compounds herein are described as calcium
channel blockers. EP-A1-563 001 is a reference under article 54(3) EPC.EP-A2-0 520 200 describes 2-amino-1-phenyl-benzimidazole derivatives and their use
in the treatment of CNS disorders through calcium channel blocking. It is an object of the present invention to provide novel benzimidazole compounds and
pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salts thereof, which are useful for the
treatment of central nervous system disorders, diseases or ailments, and especially
for the treatment of convulsions, anxiety, sleep disorders, and memory disorders.Another object of the present invention is to provide parmaceutical compositions
comprising the novel benzimidazole compounds being useful for above purposes.Additional objects will be obvious from the following description, and others will be
obvious to one skilled in the art.The invention then, interalia, comprises
