<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a door which can move back and forth between an open and a closed position (I), having a door leaf (1), a door-leaf panel or the like, which exhibits at least one floor-side edge (3) which, in the closed position (I), bears on a floor-side stop, in particular a door-case rail (4) or the like. A door of this type, in the case of which hazards and obstructions arranged in the closure path are reduced and, in particular, catching (pinching) and similar injuries to people situated in the closure path of the door are prevented is characterised in that in the stop region between the edge (3) of the door leaf (1) and the floor-side stop (4) there is provided, in the closed position (I) of the door leaf (1), a cutout (7) of a design which reduces the risk of catching, with the result that the surfaces or edges which are moved towards one another in the closure direction are arranged such that they are spaced apart from one another in the closed position (I) of the door leaf (1).

<CLAIMS>
A door (1) with a one-piece door leaf, guided
moveably overhead, wherein the bottom edge (3), when the

door is in the closed position (1), undergoes a rotation
of approximately 90째 about its longitudinal axis along

its arc of movement (5) between its open position and
its closed position, and in its closed position reaches

a close parallel position, at a distance from the
ground, to a ramp projecting from the ground, especially

a correspondingly-disposed ground-mounted bar (4) of the
door frame surround, characterised in that the bottom

edge (3) of the door leaf (1) has a crush-reducing
formation (6,9;9), at least in the area of its edge,

which faces the ground and the ramp in the closed
position (1), this formation stretching in the manner of

a profile along the length of the bottom edge (3).
A door according to claim 1, characterised in that
the edge area (7) is formed as a chamfer (6) on the

bottom limit stop of the door leaf (1).
A door according to claim 1, characterised in that
the edge area (7) is formed as a chamfer on the frame

profile (4).
A door according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the edge area (7) is formed as a rounded-off

element.
A door according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in
that the chamfer (6) runs at an angle of 30째 to 60째,

preferably 45째, to the perpendicular of the surface of
the door leaf (1).
A door according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in 
that the chamfer (6) has transition radii, preferably

with a radius of 5 mm.
A door according to claim 1, characterised in that
a pliable profile bar (9), especially made from a soft

elastomer, is disposed in the edge area (7).
A door according to claim 7, characterised in that
the profile bar (9) is formed as a full profile from

soft rubber.
A door according to claim 7, characterised in that
the profile bar (9) is formed as a hollow rubber

profile.
A door according to claim 7, characterised in that
the profile bar (9) is attached in the edge area

disposed on the side nearest the door leaf.
A door according to claim 7, characterised in that
the profile bar (9) is attached to the limit stop (3) at

the bottom of the door leaf (1) by a clasp (18, 23).
A door according to claim 7, characterised in that
the profile bar (9) comprises an elastomer, which has

differing degrees of hardness in a direction parallel to

the perpendicular of the door leaf (1).
A door according to claim 7, characterised in that
the profile bar (9) is screwed, glued, rivetted or

otherwise attached to the limit stop (3) at the bottom
of the door leaf (1).
A door according to claim 7, characterised in that
the profile bar (9) encases the bottom frame (2) of the

door leaf (1). 
A door according to claim 1 with an electrical,
electro-hydraulic or electro-pneumatic drive,

characterised in that a measuring recorder is disposed
in the closing edge (3) of the door leaf (1) to

determine the closing force, said measuring recorder
being connected to a measuring instrument which

interrupts the movement of the door leaf (1) when a
closing force threshold value is exceeded.
A door according to claim 15, characterised in that
measurement of the closing power takes place in a

specified door leaf (1) position.
