<ABSTRACT>
Electrical baking and roasting oven having a circulation fan which is arranged behind a fan-covering plate (16) in the baking chamber and is at least partly surrounded by an air-heating element, the fan-covering plate (16) having a central sucking-in region (21) lying outside the median plane of the baking chamber, as well as blowing-out regions (22, 23), through which the heated air is passed into the baking chamber. Arranged in the baking chamber is a removable baking-chamber divider (8). In order, when the baking-chamber divider (8) is removed and the entire baking-chamber volume utilized, to obtain a uniform hot-air supply also in the region of the lower level of the baking chamber for the product to be baked and roasted which is arranged there, additional blowing-out regions (24, 25, 26), which can be covered by the baking-chamber divider (8), are arranged in the lower part of the fan-covering plate (16).
