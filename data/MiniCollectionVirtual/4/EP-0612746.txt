<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel pyrimidines or 
their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and novel therapeutic 
agents for neurological diseases of the peripheral 
and central nervous systems of animals containing the 
above compounds as active ingredients. Japanese Patent Publication No. 23,394/1971 
discloses that aminopyrimidines represented by the 
following formula 
   wherein A represents an alkylene group having 
up to 16 carbon atoms, or a lower alkylene 
group substituted by an amino group or a C₂₋₅ 
acylamino group, M represents H, Na, K, NH₄, 
Mg, Ca or an organic basic ammonium salt, and n 
is a value equal to the atomic valency of M,
 
have interesting therapeutic activity, particularly as an 
anti-melanchoric agent and psychoanaleptic agent in the 
field of psychosis. Japanese Patent Publication No. 22044/1976 
discloses that dichloro-lower aliphatic carboxylic acid 
salts of 2-isopropylaminopyrimidine, such as 2-isopropylaminopyrimidine 
dichloroacetate, are useful as a 
therapeutic agent for a neurological disease. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 
100477/1977 (Patent Publication No. 28548/1984) discloses 
that 2-isopropylaminopyrimidine phosphate is useful as a 
therapeutic agent for a neurological disease. Japanese Patent Publication No. 157575/1979 
discloses a process for producing 2-chloropyrimidine in a 
high yield. A working example in this patent publication  
 
describes the preparation of 2-chloropyrimidine in a 
yield of 69 %. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 
393/1980 discloses a process for producing 2-isopropylaminopyrimidine 
in a high yield. A working example of 
this patent publication describes the preparation of 
2-isopropylaminopyrimidine in a yield of 60 %. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 
122768/1980 discloses that a hydroxy derivative of 
2-isopropylaminopyrimidine represented by the following 
formula 
   wherein A⁴, A⁵ and A⁶ each represent H or 
OH, and at least one of them represents OH,
 
is useful in the field of nerve regeneration and for 
treatment of myodystrophy. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 
145670/1980 discloses that 2-isopropylaminohalogenopyrimidines 
represented by the following formula 
   wherein A₄', A₅' and A₆' each represent H 
or a halogen atom, and at least one of them is 
a halogen atom,
 
are useful for treatment of various neurological diseases 
and myodystrophy. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 
145,671/1980 discloses a process for producing a hydroxy 
derivative of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A compound represented by the following formula (1), 
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof 

 
wherein A represents a group of the formula 

 
or 

a group of the formula 
 

R²¹ represents a group of the formula (a) 
 

   wherein R²³ represents a hydrogen atom, a C₁-C₄ 
alkyl group, a C₁-C₄ alkoxy group or a phenyl 

group and R²⁴ represents a hydrogen atom, a C₁-C₄ 
alkyl group, a cyclohexyl group, a phenyl 

group, a 4-halogenophenyl group, a p-diphenyl 
group, provided that R²³ and R²⁴ are not both 

hydrogen atoms; 
or a group of the formula (b) 

 
which is a 9-fluorenyl group or a triphenylmethyl group; 

 
R²² represents a C₁-C₄ alkyl group; and ℓ is 0 or 1.

pharmaceutically acceptable salt is selected from 

hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, bisulfites, phosphates, 
acidic phosphates, acetates, maleates, fumarates, 

succinates, lactates, tartrates, benzoates, citrates, 
glucanates, methanesulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates, 

naphthalenesulfonates and quaternary ammonium salts. 
A therapeutical composition for use in the treatment 
of neurological diseases comprising a compound or 

pharmaceutically acceptable salt as claimed in claim 1 or 2 
as an active ingredient. 
Use of a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt 
as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in the preparation of a 

pharmaceutical composition containing said compound or salt 
as active ingredient for use in the treatment of 

neurological diseases. 
A compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt as 
claimed in claim 1 or 2 for use in the treatment of 

neurological diseases.
