<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a static device for mechanically cleaning the wire rod (2) in steel-wire drawing lines (3), which includes a press (9) having a plurality of opposed working elements (11), in the form of plates, which elements are arranged alternately and on either side of the wire rod (2) and are also able to move mutually (to and fro) towards each other along guides (12), transversely to the drawing direction, by activating respective driving means (13). The working elements (11) are shaped so as mutually to co-penetrate for the purpose of compressing and holding, against the wire rod (2) advancing along the drawing line (3), a layer (16) of steel wool which is inserted into these working elements and which is intended to remove the oxide parts from the wire rod (2) which remain after the previous cleaning operations.

A static mechanical device using a layer (16) of 
steel wool to clean wire rod (2) in a steel wire 

drawing line (3) consisting of a press (9) 
equipped with at least one pair of opposing 

working elements (11) placed on both sides of the 
wire rod (2) and movable towards each other 

crossways with respect to the drawing direction 
along guides (12) under the action of respective 

drive means (13) characterized in that the said 
working elements (11) are shaped in such a way as 

to fit into each other so as to press and hold 
down the said steel wool layer (16) on the wire 

rod (2) as the latter moves along in the direction 
of drawing, the said steel wool layer (16) being 

placed between the said working elements and being 
designed to remove from the wire rod (2) all the 

oxide particles remaining from earlier cleaning 
operations. 
Device according to claim 1 characterized in that 
the said press (9) is mounted on horizontal shafts 

(10). 
Device according to claim 1 characterized in that 
the said press (9) comprises at least three of the  

 
said working elements (11) arranged in 

reciprocally alternating fashion. 
Device according to claim 1 or 3 characterized in 
that the said press (9) envisages a plurality of 

the said working elements (11) reciprocally 
assembled to form a pack. 
Device according to claim 1 characterized in that 
the said working elements (11) consist of flat 

steel plates with V-shaped working surfaces (15). 
Device according to claim 1 characterizedin that 
the said working elements (11) have through holes 

(19) made in them designed to facilitate the 
dissipation of heat. 
Device according to claim 1 characterized in that 
the said drive means (13) consist of a pneumatic 

actuator (17) associated with the working elements 
(11). 
Device according to claim 1 characterized in that 
the said drive means (13) consist of a mechanical 

actuator operating against the action of an 
elastic element and associated with the working 

elements (11). 
Device according to claim 2 characterized in that 
the said press (9) is mounted on the said 

horizontal shafts (10) through rocking bearings  
 

(50) designed to allow the said press (9) to 
automatically centre itself in relation to the 

wire rod (2).
