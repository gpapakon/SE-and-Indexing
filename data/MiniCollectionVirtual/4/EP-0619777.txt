<ABSTRACT>
A plastic foam molded body, in particular a plastic foam slab (2) made of pre-expanded granulated plastic foam is characterised in that it has a core (4) made of recycled used plastic foam which bears a covering layer (6) made of fresh, possibly different plastic foam material on at least one of its sides. In a process for producing such a plastic foam molded body (2), the core (4) is produced at first in an usual manner from recycled, ground plastic foam introduced into a molding cavity (12). The molding cavity is then enlarged to correspond to the profile of the envelope (6) at the same time as the core (4) is held in its final position with respect to the enlarged molding cavity. The enlarged molding cavity is filled with fresh prefoamed granulated raw plastic foam and said material is then set in the usual manner. The finished plastic foam molded body (2) is then removed from the mold. A device (10) for carrying out this process may have, besides two opposite molding walls (14, 16) movable towards each other, further molding walls (18, 20) which can be moved in and out in a sliding manner arranged at the periphery of the first molding walls and having a thickness which corresponds to the thickness of the wall of the covering layer (6) at that spot. The device may further have pin-shaped holding members (66) which may be moved out of the first molding walls (14, 16) and penetrate into the initially molded core (4), as well as plate-like positioning members (64) for laterally positioning the core with respect to said molding walls.
