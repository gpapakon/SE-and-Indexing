<ABSTRACT>
An image pick up and displaying system comprises an image pick 
up device (1) being provided with a signal superimposing unit (43) for 

superimposing a recognition signal at a predetermined portion on 
any of synchronous pulse signals, except for any image signals, 

the recognition signal indicating any kind of the image pick up 
device; and a display device (5) being connected to the image pick 

up device and further being provided with a signal detecting and 
sweeping control section (82,83) for detecting any recognition signal to 

control a sweeping speed and a sweeping time of sweeping on a 
screen of the display device at least in any one of vertical and 

horizontal directions thereby the image is displayed on an 
entire of the
 screen without any distortion thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an image sensor and display device, and
more particularly to an image sensor and display device
available to various size pixels of image sensors by
compensation of image stress of image signals and subsequent
display.From EP 402 992 a transmission system for transmitting a video
signal is known. This transmission system also comprises a
display device while the signal derived from a pixel source
shall be supplied to a superimposing unit for superimposing a
recognition system at a predetermined portion of time period.
Although this transmitter comprises a distortion preventing
means it would be desirable to further prevent the distortion.A videocamera for both 9 : 16 and 3 : 4 image ratios is
known from EP-A1-559 478.A display device which intends to reduce distortion is known
from EP-A2-219 638.The known image sensors have a plurality of unit pixels aligned in
matrix within an active image area having a predetermined screen
ratio. Each of the unit pixels performs a photo-electric
conversion to generate image signals for sequential reading out
operations and subsequent transfer thereof to the display device
with a predetermined screen ratio. The screen ratio of a
vertical length to a horizontal length of the active image area
is 3 : 4 in the NTSC and PAL regulations, while in the high
definition television system the screen ratio is 9 : 16. Namely,
the optical image informations are converted to the image 
signals by the image sensor with a predetermined vertical-to-horizontal
ratio of the active image area on which the pixels
are aligned in matrix. The image signals are transferred to the
display device for display on various sizes of the regulated
screens as described above.In the high definition television system, the display screen
comprises an active image area having a vertical-to-horizontal
ratio of 9 : 16 and having scanning line numbers of 1036 in
which the scanning lines run in the horizontal direction as
illustrated in FIG. 1. The one time scanning on all the scanning
lines are carried out in a time of 1/30 seconds for the two-dimensional
display. The screen comprises an interlace scanning
of A and B fields. The active image are defined by a vertical
scanning period and a horizontal scanning period. Inactive area
outside the active image area but on the screen comprises a L-shaped
area defined by a vertical retrace line period of 89
scanning lines and a horizontal retrace line period as
illustrated in FIG. 1. For example, the active image area has a
vertical size of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An image sensing and displaying system comprising:

a square pixel image camera (1) comprising a solid state image
sensor (3) and a signal superimposing unit for superimposing

on the output signal of said sensor, during a vertical retrace
period thereof, a recognition signal indicating that the

camera is one having square pixels; and
a display device (5) connected to said image camera (1), said
display device (5) being for a high definition television

system, the display device comprising a signal detecting and
sweep control means (72, 83) for detecting said recognition

signal,
whereby when said signal detecting and sweep control means
(72, 83) detects a recognition signal it controls the sweep

speed and time of an electron beam on a screen of said display
device (5) in the vertical direction so as to reduce the sweep

speed and extend the sweep time, whereby the image picked up
by the square pixel camera is displayed on the screen of said

display device (5) for high definition television without any
distortion thereof.
The image sensing and displaying system as claimed in claim
1, characterized in that said signal detecting and sweeping

controlling means (72;83) prevents a 4%-distortion of the
image displayed on said display device (5) which possess 1080

vertical scanning lines of said electron beam.
