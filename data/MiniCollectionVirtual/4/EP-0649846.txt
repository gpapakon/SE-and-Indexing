<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to galanthamine derivatives, a process for their
preparation and their use as medicamentsWO-A-88 08708 discloses galanthamine derivatives, including 6-0-demethylgalanthamine,
as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for use in the treatment of
memory dysfunction such as Alzheimer's disease.WO-A-92 20327 discloses galanthamine derivatives as cholinesterase inhibitors for
the treatment of fatigue syndromeEP-A-0 236 684 dicloses galanthamine derivatives for the treatment of Alzheimer's
diseaseNL-A-8 800 350 discloses galanthamine derivatives as cholinesterase inhibitors.This invention accordingly provides compounds of the formula

wherein
R1is hydrogen ((3 x)) ; (C1-C12)alkylcarbonyl ((3 x)) ; (C1-C12)alkoxycarbonyl ((3x)) ;
aryl(C1-C12)alkylaminocarbonyl, where 'aryl' is phenyl having 0, 1, 2 or 3
substituents independently selected from: C1-C6alkyl, C1-C6alkoxy, C1-C6alkylcarbonyl, 
halo and trifluromethyl; mono (C1-C18)alkylaminocarbonyl or
di(C1-C8)alkylaminocarbonyl;R2is (C1-C12)alkylcarbonyloxy, aryl(C1-C4)alkylcarbonyloxy, where 'aryl' is
defined as above, (C1-C12)alkoxycarbonyloxy or arylcarbonyloxy, where 'aryl'
is defined as above;R3is hydrogen, halo or (C1-C4)alkyl; and pharmaceutically acceptable addition
salts;
which are useful for alleviating various memory dysfunctions characterized by
decreased cholinergic function such as Alzheimer's disease.This invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition useful for alleviating
various memory dysfunctions characterized by decreased cholinergic function which
comprises a compound of the invention, in an amount sufficient to affect cholinergic
function and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Unless otherwise stated or indicated, the following definitions shall apply throughout
the specification and appended claims.The term "alkyl" shall mean a straight or branched alkyl group of the stated number
of carbon atoms. Examples include methyl, ethyl,
n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, and straight and branched
chain pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and pentadecyl.The term "halo" shall mean chloro, fluoro, bromo and iodo.The term "aryl" shall mean phenyl having 0, 1, 2 or 3 substituents independently
selected from the group of (C1-C6)alkyl, (C1-C6)alkoxy,
(C1-C6)alkylcarbonyl, halo or trifluoromethyl.In one embodiment of the invention are compounds of the formula (II) 

wherein
R1is hydrogen, (C1-C12)alkylcarbonyl, (C1-C12)alkoxycarbonyl,
aryl(C1-C12)alkylaminocarbonyl, where
