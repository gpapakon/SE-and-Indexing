<ABSTRACT>
The method consists in extracting (5) the phase of each of the complex signals by deleting the unknown phase jumps, in searching (6) in the series of phases obtained for a first phase range of defined length L for which the phase variation is as linear as possible, in determining (7) a second phase range of length L2 greater than L, corresponding to a more precise linear approximation, in iteratively performing (8) linear regressions by the use of a sliding window of length equal to the second phase range L2 in order to delete the residual phase jumps in order to carry out (9) a quadratic regression on the remaining phases and to calculate an overall estimate of the reference phases of the signals of each block, and to perform (10) a comparison of the mean quadratic error between the estimated reference phases and the raw phases obtained by linear regression. Application: data transmission by moving satellite.

Process for the blockwise coherent demodulation
of strings of complex signals S
n
 phase-modulated
according to specified phase states, 
characterized in
that
 it consists in extracting (5) the phase of each of
the complex signals while eliminating the unknown phase

jumps, in searching (6) through the string of phases
obtained for a first phase span of specified length L

for which the phase variation is as linear as possible,
in determining (7) a second span of phases of length L
2

greater than L corresponding to a more accurate linear
approximation, in iteratively performing (8) linear

regressions with the aid of a sliding window of length
equal to the second phase span L
2
 so as to eliminate the
residual phase jumps so as to perform (9) a quadratic

regression over the remaining phases and so as to
calculate an overall estimate of the reference phases

of the signals of each block, and in performing (10) a
comparison of the mean square error between the

estimated reference phases and the raw phases obtained
by linear regression.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the elimination (5) of the unknown phases consists
in respect of a modulation with two phase states (0-π)

in correcting the phases of the samples S
n
 while
bringing them into the phase interval



in
calculating the successive phase differences while

bringing them too into the phase interval


and in 
reconstructing a string Φ
n
 of values of phases
representative of the reference phase of the signal.
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that
, to search for the first phase
span, it consists in calculating by linear regression

over the length L the mean square phase error by taking
in succession each of the signals S
n
 as origin and in
choosing for origin that which gives the minimum mean

square error.
Device for the blockwise coherent demodulation
of strings of complex signals S
n
 phase-modulated
according to specified phase states, 
characterized in
that
 it comprises a device (2) for storing the complex
signals coupled to a device (3) for estimating the

reference phase of the signal and a device (4) coupled
to the phase estimating device (3) so as to reconstruct

the complex samples and decode the information
transmitted by the samples, the device (3) for

estimating the reference phase of the signal being
programmed so as to extract (5) the phase of each of

the complex signals while eliminating the unknown phase
jumps, search (6) through the string of phases obtained

for a first phase span of specified length L for which
the phase variation is as linear as possible, determine

(7) a second span of phases of length L
2
 greater than L
corresponding to a more accurate linear approximation,

iteratively perform (8) linear regressions with the aid
of a sliding window of length equal to the second phase

span L
2
 so as to eliminate the residual phase jumps so
as to perform (9) a quadratic regression over the

remaining phases and so as to calculate an overall
estimate of the reference phases of the signals of each

block, and perform (10) a comparison of the mean square
error between the estimated reference phases and the

raw phases obtained by linear regression.
