<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to heavy-duty solid wheels and tyres for rail locomotives and trucks made of forged, rolled, fully tempered alloyed steel. From known wheel breakages and the subsequent materials examinations to discover the causes of the damage it has been concluded that it may be attributed to the inadequate toughness properties of prior art grades of steel. A novel Cr-Ni-Mo steel has therefore been developed which, after special heat treatment, exhibits a manifestly greater potential toughness than, for example, R7 steel to the UIC code and in which, above all, the risk of wheel breakage after lengthy braking is reduced.
