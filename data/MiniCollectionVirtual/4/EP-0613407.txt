<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of assembling mechanical system having tubular constructional elements, such methods including the furnishing of an interior work surface of a first constructional element (14) having a complemental internal structure and, further, positioning a second tubular constructional element (16) so that at least one surface thereof is proximal to the complemental internal surface of the first constructional element. Positioning a working element (48, 50) of a highly extended longitudinal tool (24) reciprocatingly within the second constructional element, the working element situated proximally to the complemental internal structure of the first constructional element. Applying, through the longitudinal tool, to the working member a transverse force sufficient to deform the one surface of the second constructional element into the geometry of a complemental structure of the first constructional element, securing the respective elements to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Metho of Assembly of Tubular Metallic Fences BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn the assembly of fences and railings consisting of picket elements, a labor-intensive aspect associated with the construction of such fences has resided in the attachment of the picket elements thereof with the transverse members of the fence. More particularly, in recent years, certain metallic picket fences consisting of hollow tubular elements have come into vogue to the extent that, in many applications, wooden picket fences are now rarely used. Metal picket fences of this type are shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 11 of the Drawings.A difficult and laborious aspect of the assembly of such metal picket fences lies in the connection (also known as the swedge ) of the tubular pickets at the points thereof at which they pass through or within the horizontal cross- members of the fencing system. Historically, this connection has been effected by means of welding of the vertical pickets at each point that one passes- through a transverse horizontal member. This process is time-consuming, inexact and often 

 unaesthetic in that the paint or other coating upon he elements of the fence may be broken, burnt or otherwise rendered unsightly by such welding thereupon. Proper fusion of the paint finish at welded points is therefore, nearly impossible. Thusly, cracking, pealing, chipping is a result.Where, in the past, screws were used to secure the respective members, the result was that of rusting, vibrating and loosening of the screws and eventually of their falling-off of the structure.The instant invention is concerned with an assembly method, the usage of wτhich will obviate the need for welding or any other external process to effect the connection of hollow or tubular vertical picket elements within transverse hollow or tubular members of a metal fence system.Tn addition to the need for a method of more easily assembling metal picket fences of the type shown in the drawings, there exists a need for a constructional method for the positioning of emblems, a d the like, upon the tops of picket fences. Such a fence is shown in the view of Fig. 11. 

 In addition to the need for an improvement in existing methods of assembly of tubular picket fences, there exists numerous other mechanical systems in which one or more elongated tubular constructional element must be secured to a second tubular constructional element. One example of a structure of this type appears in Fig. 14 in which there is shown a metal ladder. Metal ladders are typically

THE CLAIMS
Having thus described m invention, what I claim as new, useful and non-obvious and, accord¬ ingly, secure by Letters Patent of the United States is:
1. A method of assembly of components of a tubular metallic picket fence, comprising the steps of:
(a) furnishing, at an interior work site of a horizontal metallic tubular constructional element of the picket fence to be assembled, at least one internal structure having a defined female geometr 
*
;
(b) providing, through said horizontal constructional element, a vertical opening proximal to said defined internal structure, to enable passage therethrough of a vertical tubular constructional element; 


(c) positioning said vertical tubular constructional element within said vertical opening of said horizontal element so that at least one surface of said vertical element is proximal to said defined internal structure of said horizontal element;
(d) providing, within said 


 tubular element, at said one surface of said vertical constructional element, a distal portion of a highly extended longitudinal member of substantiall
τ
 uniform cross- section having a smaller external diameter than the internal diameter of said vertical tubular element, said distal portion comprising at least one working surface trans¬ versely extensible in reaction to longitudinal extension of said extended member; and 


 (e) providing and applj'ing, through said extended longitudinal member, selectable powered longitudinal thrust of said extended member, sufficient provide to said working surface of said distal portion of said extended member, a transverse force sufficient to deform said one surface of said vertical tubular constructional element- into said defined female geometry of said internal structure of said horizontal tubular element, thereb
τ
 effecting the securement of said vertical and horizontal construc¬ tional elements to each other.
2. The method of assembl 
r
 of components of metallic fence as recited in Claim 1, further comprising the step of:
(f) providing further defined female internal structures within said horizontal tubular element and corresponding further 


 vertical openings through said hori¬ zontal element to thereby provide sites of securement to additional deformable stirfaces of other vertical tubular elements.
3. The method as recited in Claim 2, further comprising the steps of:
(g) providing a plurality of said horizontal constructional elements having a pluralitj
r
 of said vertical openings and corresponding defined internal structures, according to Step (f) above;
(h) roviding a plurality of vertical tubular constructional elements for positioning within said openings;
(i) selectably positioning said working surface of said highl
*
 extended longitudinal member at each of said one surfaces of said vertical constructional elements requiring securement to said horizontal constructional elements at the sites of said defined internal structures; and
(j) repeating Step (e) above. 


whereby all desired rigid securements, at internal intersections of horizontal and vertical tubular elements of the metallic fence, are thereb - accomplished .
4. The method as recited in Claim 3, further comprise the steps of: securing ornamental elements to said tubular metallic fence bj' positioning such ornamental elements at vertical tubular elements to which securement of such ornamental elements is desired; and
repeating Step (e) above.
5. The product of the method of Claim 3.--
