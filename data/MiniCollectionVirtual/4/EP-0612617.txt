<ABSTRACT>
A roller having a solid or hollow roller body (3) and one or more 
heat pipes (10) disposed along a central axis of the roller body from 

its one end. A portion (12) of the heat pipe is extended from the roller 
body (3). The extended portion (12) of the heat pipe has thereon a 

radiation device (13) which is prepared as to be a fin type. When heating 
the roller, the extended portion (12) of the heat pipe (10) will be 

utilized as an heat-inlet section, so that the applied heat is 
transmitted to the roller body (3). While, cooling the roller, the 

mentioned heat-inlet section is then used as a radiation device to 
release the heat from the roller body (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is broadly concerned with inking rollers 
in a printing machine or several rollers in a machine for 
processing plastic films and intended particularly to be used to 
a heating or cooling roller (referred to as a thermal roller in 
the following description ) being in control of its surface temper 
ature by being heated or cooled. Rollers rotating in contact with others are generally 
employed in several machinery. Taking for an instance, there are 
arranged several inking rollers between an ink reservoir and a 
plate cylinder in the printing machine to feed ink to plates 
which are attached to the plate cylinder by transmitting ink 
sequentially from one roller to the other contiguous roller. 
These rollers are apt to go up the temperature of ink on the 
surface thereof due to a rolling friction heat generated by rotate 
in contact with others. But, according to specifications of ink, 
several conditions such as an admirable temperature and range of 
temperature in use of ink are prescribed. The preferable 
temperature of ink in offset press is generally recommended to be 
about 28 degrees. It is then noted that the surface temperature  
 
of the inking roller being out of the mentioned conditions for ink 
becomes a main cause to spoil quality of printed papers. It is 
also observed in a case of low room temperature in a cold district 
that the printing machine should be idled until the temperature of 
ink reaches to the admirable one for the start of daily work, 
which causes a drop in productivity. Reflecting such prior art in this field of invention, 
some of technology to cool and heat the roller have been proposed 
so as to keep the surface temperature of roller preferable level. 
Some of known technology to cool the roller are as follows; a 
water-cooled method wherein a water such as ground water is 
circulated in the roller, a freeze-cycle method wherein a heat 
exchange is effected by a cooling water or refrigerant, and a 
heat-pipe method. An official gazette issued January 11th in 1988 
under the Japanese Patent Laid-open No. SHO 63-5944, as an example 
of conventional technology, described a cylinder-cooling device 
applying the freeze-cycle method. As another reference, the 
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. HEI 3-21453 issued on January 30th 
in 1991 proposes a method of controlling the temperature of ink on 
the plate attached to a plate cylinder, wherein a fluid medium is 
circulated in the plate cylinder to control the temperature of ink 
by regulating the fluid medium.
