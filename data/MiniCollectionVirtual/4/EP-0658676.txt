<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a glazing system for exterior walls of buildings, in particular for doors of industrial buildings, having at least one opening (1) for receiving a glass pane (3) in the wall (2), having in each case one rubber profile strip (4, 5) which runs around the outer edge of the glass pane (3) and of which the cross-section exhibits a bearing section (41, 51), resting by means of a bearing surface (411, 511) on the outer edge of the glass pane (3) and by means of an opposite surface (411', 511') on the inner edge of the opening (1), as well as a generally U-shaped sealing lip (42, 52) which at least partially encloses a projecting border (6) which encloses the inner edge of the opening (1) on the outside, and having a metal strip (7) which rests on the inner side (31) of the glass pane (3) and is connected to the inner edge of the opening (1) preferably by means of screws or rivets (8), the projecting border (6) exhibiting a rectangular outline with rounded corners. The glazing system according to the invention is characterized in that the opening (1) is rectangular, in that the glass pane (3) is rectangular, and in that the profile strip (4, 5), between the sealing lip (42, 52) and the bearing section (41, 51), exhibits a groove (43, 53) which extends from the bearing surface (411, 511) in the direction of the opposite surface (411', 511') and terminates in the vicinity of the surface (411', 511') and along which the profile strip (4, 5) can be divided in its longitudinal direction, at least over sub-regions of its length.

Glazing system for outer walls of buildings, in particular 
for doors and gates of industrial buildings, 

comprising at least one aperture (1) for receiving 
a pane, in particular a glass pane (3), in the wall 

(2), with a rubber profiled strip (4, 5) encompassing 
each outer edge of the pane (3) with the strip 

comprising a contact section (41, 51) abutting at 
the outer edge of the pane (3) with a contact area 

(411, 511), and at the inner edge of the aperture 
(1) with an opposite area (411', 511'), with the contact 

section comprising a generally U-shaped sealing 
lip (42, 52) at least partly encompassing a protruding 

border (6) which encompasses the inner edge of 
the aperture (1) at the outer side thereof, and 

metal ledges (7) abutting at the inner side (31) of 
the pane (3), and connected with the inner edge of 

the aperture (1) preferably by means of screw bolts 
or rivets (8), wherein the protruding border (6) comprises 

a rectangular contour with rounded corners,
characterized in
 
that the aperture (1) is rectangular, that the pane 

(3) is rectangular, and that the profiled strip (4, 
5) comprises a groove (43, 53) between the sealing 

lip (42, 52) and the contact section (41, 51) with 
the groove extending from the contact area (411, 

511) in the direction towards the opposite area 
(411', 511') and ending close to the opposite area 

(411', 511'), with the profiled strip (4, 5) to be  
 

ripped up in the longitudinal direction thereof at 
least in part areas of its length along the profiled 

strip (4, 5). 
Glazing system according to claim 1, characterized 
in that equally spaced from the groove (53) a further 

groove (54) with the same dimensions is positioned. 
Glazing system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the bottom of the groove (43, 53, 54) 

ends approximately 1,5 mm short of the opposite area 
(411', 511'). 
Glazing system according to one of the preceeding 
claims, characterized in that the profiled strip (4, 

5) is manufactured as an extruded profile of rubber 
or plastic material with a shore hardness of 55 to 

65. 
Glazing system according to one of the preceeding 
claims, characterized in that the profiled strip (4, 

5) at each side thereof facing the protruding border 
(6), and the outer side (32) of the pane (3) comprises 

at least one protruding lip (44, 45). 
Glazing system according to one of the preceeding 
claims, characterized in that the pane as a glass 

pane (3) consists of a single pane or insulating 
panes or compound panes. 
Glazing system according to one of the preceeding 
claims, characterized in that a plate of plastic 

matrial or metal or insulating plate with a plastic 
lining is used as the pane (3).
