<ABSTRACT>
A canned motor for use in a pump has an outer frame 
casing (24) fitted over a stator (27), a pair of 

side frame members (25,26) 
welded to respective open ends of the outer frame casing, a 

can (29) fitted in the stator and joined to the side frame 
members, and an outer cylinder (9) disposed around the outer 

frame casing with an annular spaced defined therebetween, the 
outer cylinder being welded to the outer frame casing. The 

outer cylinder has a pair of flanges (9a,9b) disposed respectively on 
axially spaced open ends thereof for attachment to components 

of a pump assembly and holding a fluid being handled within 
the outer cylinder. The outer cylinder has a hole defined in 

an outer circumferential wall thereof for passing leads for 
connection to a power supply.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pump employing a canned motor 
which lends itself to a wide variety of pump designs . There have heretofore been full-circumferential 
flow pumps designed for cooling the motor and reducing noise 
from the motor. Strong demands for pumps of non-seal 
structure which do not have sealing devices such as 
mechanical seals or the like are met by canned motor pumps 
and magnet drive pumps. The greatest requirement which 
present pumps have to meet is a reduction in size. One 
effort to meet the requirement is directed to increase the 
rotational speed of the motor with a frequency converter such 
as an invertor or the like. It has been customary to protect 
pumps from corrosive water by encasing the pump with a 
housing made of pressed corrosion-resistant stainless sheet. Generally, pumps can be classified into different 
structures including multistage pumps and double-suction 
pumps by performance limitations, and also classified into 
ground-installed pumps and submerged pumps by limitations on 
the environment in which they are used. Four main requirements to be met by pumps are thus  
 
summarized as (1) silence, (2) small size, (3) non-sealed 
structure, and (4) corrosion resistance. However, actual 
technical limitations have prevented pumps which satisfy all 
the four requirements from being produced so far. 
Accordingly, manufacturers have been required to produce a 
wide variety of pumps. Conventional full-circumferential 
flow pumps have also been categorized into different 
structures, and it has been necessary for manufacturers to 
produce full-circumferential flow pumps of different 
structures though they have the same output power. Such a 
conventional practice has been poor in productivity. EP-A-0 566 088 which falls under Art. 54 (3) EPC and is 
therefore not relevant to the question of inventive step, 
discloses a canned motor for use in a pump. A frame casing 
surrounds a stator of said motor. An outer cylinder 
together with a suction-side casing and a discharge-side 
casing are provided. DE-A-32 39 601 discloses a full circumferential in-line 
immersion pump having a canned motor. The outer casing of 
said pump is of an integral construction.  
 Is an an object of the present invention to provide 
a pump having canned motor which lends itself 
to a wide variety of pump designs.  
 According the present invention, there is 
provided a pump comprising: a canned motor 
comprising a 
stator, a frame casing disposed around the stator 
a shaft rotatably
