<ABSTRACT>
A connector comprises a connector housing and at 
least one metal terminal. The connector housing comprises, 

at least one terminal accommodating hole for receiving the 
metal terminals, primary locking means for elastically 

engaging with the metal terminals, at least one fallout 
preventing protrusion formed on the wall of the terminal 

accommodating holes, and at least one window for inserting a 
jig. The metal terminal comprises secondary locking means 

extended from the metal terminal, confronting with the window 
when the metal terminal is locked by the primary locking 

means while being avoided interference with the fallout 
preventing protrusion, and deformed by a jig inserting into 

the window to engage with the fallout preventing protrusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a double locking type
connector.A so-called "double locking system" of fixing a metal
terminal inserted in a connector housing is well known in the
art. In a connector of this system, a deformable elastic
locking piece is provided in a terminal accommodating hole
formed in the connector housing, to elastically engage with
the metal terminal. After the metal terminal has been
primarily locked in the above-described manner, a retainer is
coupled to the connector housing so that it secondarily
(finally) locks the metal terminal with its part protruded
into the terminal accommodating hole. The retainer is
provided as a component which is divided from the connector
housing to be directly engaged with the connector housing, or
it is coupled through a hinge to the latter; (see e.g. US-A-4 867 705).The above-described conventional connector suffers
from the following difficulties: The connector having the
retainer as a divided component to be directly engaged with
the connector housing is relatively large in the number of
components, and rather troublesome in handling and in
maintenance. On the other hand, in the case of the connector
having the retainer coupled through the hinge to the 
connector housing, the hinge may be broken during the use of
the connector. In addition, the connector, which is
relatively intricate in configuration as a whole, is rather
difficult to form. For each of the connectors, the retainer
is an essential component, which increases the manufacturing
cost of the connector.In view of the foregoing, an object of this invention
is to provide a connector in which a metal terminal is
positively secured with simple means, and which can be
manufactured at lower cost.The foregoing object of the invention has been
achieved by the provision of a connector according to the
present invention comprising a connector housing and at least
one metal terminal. The connector housing comprises, at
least one terminal accommodating hole for receiving the metal
terminals, primary locking means for elastically engaging
with the metal terminals, at least one fallout preventing
protrusion formed on the wall of the terminal accommodating
holes, and at least one window for inserting a jig. The
metal terminal comprises secondary locking means extended
from the metal terminal, confronting with the window when the
metal terminal is locked by the primary locking means while
being avoided interference with the fallout preventing 
protrusion, and when deformed by said jig inserting into the

<CLAIMS>
A connector comprising:

a connector housing (8); and
at least one metal terminal (1):
said connector housing comprising;

at least one terminal accommodating hole (13) for
receiving said metal terminals;
primary locking means (9) for elastically
engaging with said metal terminals;
at least one fallout preventing protrusion (19)
formed on the wall of said terminal accommodating holes; and
at least one window (16) for inserting a jig (17):
said metal terminal comprising;

   secondary locking means (11) extended from said
metal terminal, confronting with said window when said metal

terminal is locked by said primary locking means while being
avoided interference with said fallout preventing protrusion,

and when deformed by said jig inserting into said window to engage said secondary locking means
with said fallout preventing protrusion.
A connector according to claim 1,

wherein said secondary locking means comprises a pair

of secondary locking pieces,
said fallout preventing protrusion is arranged on a
center line of each of the terminal accommodating holes, and 
the width of said fallout preventing protrusion is
smaller than the distance between said secondary locking

pieces of each of the metal terminals.
A connector according to claim 2,

wherein each of the secondary locking pieces has a
sloped surface (20) at the top corner, so that
said sloped surfaces of the secondary locking pieces agree with guide surfaces (21) of said jig (17).
A connector according to claim 1,

wherein said secondary locking means comprises a pair
of secondary locking pieces,
said fallout preventing protrusion comprises a pair
of protrusions which are separated each other and formed on

either side corner of each of the terminal accommodating
holes, and
the width between a pair of said fallout preventing
protrusions is larger than the distance between said

secondary locking pieces of each of the metal terminal.
A connector according to claim 4,

wherein each of the secondary locking pieces has a
sloped surface (20) at the top corner, so that
said sloped surfaces of the secondary locking pieces agree with guide surfaces (21) of said jig (17).
