<ABSTRACT>
A hollow rubber play ball is disclosed that uses 
a combination two or more fillers to produce desirable 

playing properties in a tennis ball as specified by the 
International Lawn Tennis Federation (ITF). The preferred 

play ball is a pressureless tennis ball. The specific 
fillers disclosed are mineral type particulate reinforcing 

fillers such as silicas and carbon black, polymeric 
fillers such as cellulose, a reaction product of grafting 

polyethylene with cellulose, and ethylene-vinyl acetate 
copolymers. These fillers can also have surface 

treatments to enhance the elastomer-filler interaction. 
Another reinforcing filler that can be introduced with the 

rubber components is the non-rubber constituents in skim 
rubber that
 serve to increase the modulus of a compounded 
rubber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates playballs, particularly tennis
balls, and to ball manufacturing processes.Gas filled rubber play balls for tennis and
other games are well known. They contain gases at
atmospheric pressure or at elevated pressures. Tennis
balls filled with compressed gases are preferred by many
players due to their perceived playing properties.
Typically, the balls start out with gases at pressures of
10 psi (0.7 kg f/cm2, 0.069 MPa) above atmospheric pressure
and then lose pressure during storage and use. The loss
of pressure causes the playing characteristics of the ball
to change. An alternative to pressurized balls are
balls with an internal pressure near atmospheric pressure.
These are known as pressureless balls. To get playing
characteristics similar to a pressurized ball,
pressureless balls tend to have thicker walls than
pressurized balls. To maintain the same ball weight with
thicker walls, the density of the rubber compound in the
wall needs to be lower.Prior art proposals substituted thermoplastic
polymeric fillers, such as polystyrene, for mineral type
fillers, because ofthe lower density of thermoplastics relative
to many mineral type fillers. The high melting
temperatures of these thermoplastics require an extra
processing step where the thermoplastics were blended with
the elastomer and dispersed at the higher temperature
where the thermoplastic softens.A problem with many rubber ball compounds is
the tendency of the ball to soften (the modulus of the
cured ball decreases) as a result of the repeated
deformation during play. This changes the play
characteristics of the ball. A reduced tendency to soften
is clearly an advantage. EP-A-456036 describes making pressureless tennis
balls using a rubber composition of one or more
crosslinked rubbers, such as high cis-1,4 polybutadiene
rubber, together with fillers which may be silica or
cellulose powder.EP-A-459436 describes pressureless tennis balls
whose rubber composition contains 5 to 60 parts by weight
of polyethylene per 100 parts by weight of rubber to
improve rebound properties.In a first aspect, the present invention provides a
playball in the form of a hollow sphere comprising a
blend of at least:
(a) one or more crosslinked rubbers, and(b) one or more reinforcing particulate fillers
comprising silica or carbon black or combinations
thereof, characterised by the presence in the blend of(c) a polymeric filler which is (i) an ethylene-vinyl
acetate copolymer and/or (ii) the reaction product
of grafting cellulose with
