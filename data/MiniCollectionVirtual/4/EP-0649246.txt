<ABSTRACT>
A method of enhancing predefined features of a scanned image of a 
document page of reduced size for display includes subsampling (130) the pixels of 

the scanned image to achieve a desired degree of reduction of the image size. The 
subsampled signals are passed through a filter (130) to obtain gray scale values. A 

sharpening filter (140) is applied to the subsampled pixels to enhance the predefined 
features of the image.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for generating
from an electronic document page having a first resolution,
a representation of the document page for display on a
display device capable of displaying an image having a
second resolution lower than the first resolution.Electronic document systems are becoming increasingly popular for
storing reference materials. Conventional electronic document systems comprise a
scanner which scans an original document, digitizes each page of the document
image and converts the image to picture elements, or pixels; a computer for
processing the digitized signals and for performing any modifications to the image
such as, but not limited to, size reduction and a monitor for viewing the scanned
document. The scanned documents are then stored for later retrieval.Electronic documents can be easily retrieved from a document system's
memory and viewed on a monitor. However, the amount of data contained in a
standard 8.5 x 11 inch document page significantly exceeds the amount of data
which can be viewed on a typical monitor. In particular, a standard image resolution
for document scanners is 300 pixels per inch (conventionally referred to as dots per
inch or dpi). Thus, for an 8.5 x 11 inch document page, the scanned size is 2550 x
3300 pixels. The pixel dimensions of the screen of a conventional monitor are 1600
x 1280. Based on these measurements, it is evident that a full page cannot be
completely displayed on such a monitor.It is, thus, well known that if the entire document page is to be viewed
on the monitor, the amount of data contained in the document page must be reduced.
Indeed, one approach known in the prior art is to subsample the image in such a way
as to match the pixels of the subsampled image with those of the monitor on which it
is to be displayed. This approach, however, can result in a severe loss of clarity,
such as edge definition, and a noticeable reduction in the size of, for example, text or
other features. In the above illustration, for example, no less than 38% of the image
data is lost.In standard digital signal image processing practice, a low-pass filter is
applied to the document image signals during subsampling. The low pass filtering is
required to reduce aliasing of higher frequency information upon the lower
frequency information left after subsampling effectively at a lower rate. The low
pass filter is typically a KxK filter which is sized in accordance with the amount of
reduction desired. Typically, the size of the filter, i.e., the value

A method for generating from an electronic document page having a
first resolution, a representation of the document page for display on a display device

(170) capable of displaying an image having a second resolution which is lower than
the first resolution of the electronic document page, the method comprising passing

the pixels through a low pass filter (130), sub-sampling the pixel to achieve a desired
degree of reduction of the image size, and enhancing predefined features of the

reduced image, the predefined features corresponding to particular attributes of a text
character, each of the predefined features represented by a predetermined topological

arrangement of pixels, each of the pixels having a particular gray scale value,
CHARACTERIZED BY:


applying a sharpening filter (140) to the sub-sampled pixels, the
sharpening filter (140) comparing the gray scale value of the set of pixels, the set of

pixels comprising a pixel XO in the reduced image and at least four neighboring
pixels;
identifying a particular topological feature of the set of pixels by
determining if a match exists between the set of pixels in one of a plurality of stored

pixel arrangements, each stored pixel arrangement corresponding to a particular
predefined feature, wherein the predefined feature comprises at least one of a peak, a

ridge, a hole, and an endline;
modifying the gray scale value of the pixel XO by a specified amount,
based on the particular topological feature identified, such that the corresponding

predefined feature represented by the pixel is enhanced, wherein the predefined
feature comprises at least one of a peak, a ridge, a hole, and an endline; and
repeating the above steps for each pixel in the image.
A method according to claim 1 wherein said sharpening filter (140) is
a 3 x 3 cross filter.
A method according to claim 1 comprising the step of converting the
gray scale image to a binary image.
