<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink
suitably used in ink-jet recording apparatus, an ink-jet
recording process and apparatus making use of the
ink. More particularly, it is concerned with an ink,
and an ink-jet recording process and apparatus, that
can make a record in a high density, at a superior
quality level and in a good fixing performance, using
what is called plain paper such as woodfree paper,
paper for copying, letter paper, thermal transfer
paper and business form paper for wire-dot-matrix
printers.Water-based inks prepared by dissolving a
water-soluble dye in an aqueous medium are hitherto
used as ink-jet recording solutions. Such recording
solutions are required;
(1) to give images with a sufficient density;(2) to have good drying properties on recording
mediums;(3) to cause no feathering in recorded images;(4) to cause no bleeding of recorded images even when 
brought into contact with water, alcohol or the like;(5) to provide recorded images with a good light-fastness;(6) to cause no clogging at the nozzle tips;(7) to cause no difficulties such as blurring of recorded
images when printing is continuously carried out or
again started after being left standing for a long time;(8) to be stable throughout storage;(9) to have no problem on the safety of users; and(10) to cause no problems during use, even when
brought into contact with members that constitute
recording means. In ink-jet recording systems that
utilize heat energy, recording solutions are required,
in addition to the foregoing requirements;(11) to have a good fastness to heat and have no
adverse influence on heat energy generating devices.In relation to these properties, the above
requirements stand trade-off in the material
constitution of ink-jet recording solutions hitherto
put into practical use, and it has become difficult to
satisfy the requirements made on performance in recent
years. Almost all of the recording solutions hitherto
put into practical use comprise a water-soluble dye,
water and a water-soluble organic solvent, and it has
been a particularly difficult subject to satisfy both
print quality level and fixing performance. It is 
hitherto typically known to add water-soluble resins
such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol and
cellulose derivatives to water-based recording
solutions so that any irregular feathering can be
decreased and a quality level can be elevated. Such
materials, however, may cause an increase in viscosity
of ink to lower response frequencies, to make initial
ejection response poor
