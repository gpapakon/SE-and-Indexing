<ABSTRACT>
When an image display unit (70) displays a magnified image of 
an object being examined, a measuring unit (20) automatically 

computes the dimensions of the image at the preset position. 
A tolerance range setting unit (30) has been supplied with an 

upper and a lower limit value according to which it can judge 
the dimensions of the object at the preset position to be 

normal, whereas a comparison-decision unit (40) decides that 
the dimensions thus computed are held between the upper and 

lower limit values. When the measured result is found outside 
the range of upper to lower limit values, the right-or-wrong 

decision data is stored in a memory (50) and is redisplayed 
in the form of an image by the image display unit (70) at 

proper timing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to electron beam
measuring apparatus and more particularly to an electron beam
measuring apparatus fit for use in automatically measuring the
dimensions of a microscopic pattern on a semiconductor chip
during the process of manufacturing semiconductor devices.Electron beam measuring apparatus have been used for
measuring the width of circuit patterns and the diameters of
contact holes during the process of manufacturing semiconductor
devices.When desired circuit patterns are formed by etching
conductive films such as metal films, semiconductor films or
the like deposited on the surfaces of semiconductor wafers, for
example, the photographic exposure technique is utilized for
forming a photoresist pattern on the surface of a conductive
film beforehand and the conductive film is then etched with the
photoresist pattern as a mask.The width and diameter of the photoresist pattern are
measured by an electron beam measuring apparatus after the
pattern is formed, so that the pattern having nonstandardized
dimensions and diameter is prevented from being passed through
the etching process. Those having nonstandardized dimensions 
and the like are sent back to the preceding process setup after
their photoresist patterns are peeled off so as to form
respective patterns again.In operation, about five sheets of wafers in total are
first selected from one lot (of e.g., 26 sheets) and
measurement is automatically made of pattern width and hole
diameter in the principal part of each chip arranged in the
corner or central portion of each wafer. If any one of the
chips is found out of the standard, all wafers in that lot are
sent back to the preceding process step where each one is
provided with a photoresist pattern again.Due to the following reasons, the measured results have
been known to admit errors in cases where electron beams are
used for automatic measurement:
(1) Image is out of focus; (2) The bottom edge cannot be identified as the contrast
is lowered by the charged surface of a sample especially when
the hole diameter is measured; and (3) Starting or terminating point of measurement is
misjudged as a foreign substance may be taken as an edge. The measured results which are outside the range of
tolerance do not always signify that the dimensions of the
photoresist pattern and the hole diameters are unusual.
However, preference has heretofore been given to measured
results, which is problematical in that even those actually 
within the range of tolerance are regarded as
