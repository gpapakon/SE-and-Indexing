<ABSTRACT>
A wiper apparatus has an arm head (12) reciprocating with 
a rotational centerline m of a wiper arm (122) as a rotation 

center by receiving motive force from a reciprocating rod (4). 
An elastic rubber (20) is provided coaxially proximate to the 

center of rotation m which becomes the rotational center of 
the wiper blade (16) when self-induced vibration arising from 

the fact that the coefficient of friction between the window 
glass and the wiper blade (16) is inversely proportional to the 

movement speed of the wiper blade is about to be generated, 
the elastic rubber (20) deforms so as to absorb the screeching 

vibration of the wiper blade (16). Because of this, the arm 

head (12) performs smooth reciprocating motion during wiping

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wiper apparatus for 
vehicles to clean windows of vehicles. A conventional wiper apparatus for vehicles cleans a 
window glass surface by changing driving force of a motor to 
reciprocation movement of a wiper blade mounted on one end of 
a wiper arm, via a link mechanism. According to such a conventional wiper apparatus for 
vehicles, self-induced vibration occurs due to the fact that 
a coefficient of friction between the window glass and the 
wiper blade is inversely proportional to the movement speed of 
the wiper blade, and since this self-induced vibration becomes 
screeching vibration, there is the problem of an unpleasant 
sensation imparted to the driver or a passenger within the 
vehicle compartment. Generally, when a wiper blade reciprocates over a 
window surface, if for example a film of wax has been formed 
on the window surface, a non-uniform state of the coefficient 
of friction between the wiper blade and the window is formed, 
and so it is prone to occur marked screeching vibration 
between the wiper blade and window or the wiper arm and 
window. The occurrence of such screeching vibration also 
caused by the coefficient of friction µ of the wiper blade  
 
with respect to the window glass surface and the wiper blade 
speed v are in an inversely proportional relationship, as is 
shown in FIG. 4. In order to eliminate the unpleasant sensation based 
on this vibration, a method of suppressing occurrence of 
vibration by heightening rigidity of the wiper arm has been 
employed. According to this method, however, a 
vibration-reducing effect is not enough in proportion to the 
increased weight and higher production cost of the wiper arm. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
wiper apparatus for vehicles which effectively reduces the 
unpleasant sensation imparted to the driver and passenger by 
suppressing screeching vibration of the wiper arm with low 
production cost. To achieve the object the wiper apparatus for vehicles 
in one preferred mode has a wiper arm enabled to reciprocate; 
a drive mechanism driving said wiper arm; a driving force 
conveyance member conveying driving force of said drive 
mechanism to said wiper arm; a wiper blade connected to said 
wiper arm and enabled to reciprocate and slide over a surface 
of a window; means for generating a spring force and damping 
force which suppress self-induced vibration of said wiper arm 
by both conveying said driving force to said wiper arm and 
being deformed in a rotational direction of
