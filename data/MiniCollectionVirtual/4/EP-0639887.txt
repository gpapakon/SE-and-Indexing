<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of electrical 
engineering, and more specifically to power semiconductor 
and electron converters with improved frequency characteristics 
in the power ranges from 5 kVA to 100 MVA and 
higher, conversion frequency ranges from 50 Hz to 20 kHz 
and higher, with an a.c. and d.c. output, at a voltage of 
up to 110 kVA and higher. The field of application of the 
converters is secondary power supply sources (herebelow 
referred to as S), such as devices for radioelectronics, 
welding, electroplating, laser and other electrical technologies, 
converters for electrical drives and electric 
power systems. The improved frequency characteristics of 
S manifest both as higher frequencies of electric energy 
conversion and a lower level of parasitic frequencies at 
the source input and output. Prior-art supply sources (1 to 12) comprise at least 
one multipurpose conversion component (CC) (an input conversion 
component G1,T and an output conversion component 
G2,T) based on rectifier cells Rec, controlled rectifier 
cells Recc included, and can comprise T ≦ 1 galvanoisolation 
transformers (GIT) with C ≧ 2 sections of primary 
and secondary windings. The CC performs F functions, namely, 
the functions of rectifications, inversion, voltage 
stepping-up and stepping-down and others. In order to improve 
the frequency characteristics of the source by reducing 
the leakage inductances of the GIT windings, the 
sections thereof are made bifilar, i.e. by a double wire 
(8, 9). Voltage stepping-up and stepping-down in such GIT 
are effected due to parallel connection of the sections 
of one winding and series connection of the other winding 
sections (8). Conversion components G1, 0 and G2,0 comprise  
 
respectively L₀ ≧ 2 of the i-th and M₀ ≧ 2 of the 
j-th (i = 1 to L₀, j = 1 to M₀) conversion cells (CCel) 
series connected between the input and output of the CC. 
In this case 
G1,0 + G2,0 = 1  
, and the frequency characteristics 
are improved owing to a multi-cell circuit (MC) 
of connection of the CCel (1) and also due to the internal 
circuit of the CCel formed as 'Motovilov's transformer' 
(MT, a constant-current power transformer, CCPT) (1 to 6) 
based on parallel connection of two groups of components. 
These groups each includes Hi,j ≧ 1 windings of the converter 
transformer, which have opposite orientation in 
different groups and similar orientation within one group. 
Each group includes Reci,j ≧(3Hi,j - 1) rectifier cells, 
among which Reci,j,c ≧ 0 rectifier
