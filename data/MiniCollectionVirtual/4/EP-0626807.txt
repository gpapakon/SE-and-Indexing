<ABSTRACT>
A method for facilitating cleanout of residual sulfonylurea pesticide from spray tank equipment comprising (i) formulating the sulfonylurea as an agriculturally suitable water-soluble salt composition before spray tank application, (ii) applying the salt composition to the crop and (iii) rinsing the tank substantially free of residual sulfonylurea more easily than is possible when the sulfonylurea is not formulated as a salt.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR SPRAY TANK CLEANOUT Sulfonylureas, as a class, are highly active pesticides. For this reason, care must be taken to make sure that all traces of sulfonylurea are cleaned out of the spray equipment (hereafter referred to as spray tank) , which is used to apply pesticides to crops, before an applicator uses this equipment in a subsequent application to treat a crop that is sensitive or will be injured by the sulfonylurea used in the previous spray tank application. Adequate cleanout may require a rinsing procedure that is time- consuming and causes an environmental waste-water disposal problem.Salts of the sulfonylureas are generally known as are methods for making them. What has not been appreciated until now is the advantage that can be achieved in spray tank cleanout when the sulfonylurea active ingredient is applied in its salt form rather than in its acid form. The described salt formulations can be applied conventionally or using chemical injection technology since the soluble formulation gives a solution that can be uniformly injected into the spray boom.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThis invention concerns a method for reducing residual sulfonylurea pesticide contamination of a spray tank from which the sulfonylurea is applied, comprising the steps: i) formulating the sulfonylurea active ingredient as an agriculturally suitable water soluble salt composition before spray tank application, thereby increasing solubility of the sulfonylurea and 

decreasing the amount of insoluble sulfonylurea available for residual contamination of the spray tank, ii) applying the sulfonylurea salt composition to the crop while minimizing buildup of insoluble sulfonylurea in the spray tank, and iii) rinsing the spray tank substantially free of residual sulfonylurea, after application, in an operation in which the sulfonylurea remaining in the spray tank is reduced significantly versus the amount remaining when sulfonylurea is not formulated as a water-soluble salt before application.The sulfonylureas whose spray tank buildup is curtailed by the method of this invention are the sulfonylurea acids either when used alone or with one or more tank mix partners. The bene its achieved by this invention have been found to be more pronounced when the sulfonylurea is employed with a tank mix partner. The benefits are even more noteworthy when earlier tank mixes have left organic deposits on inside spray tank surfaces. In such instances, it is believed that undissolved particles of the sulfonylurea are held by the
