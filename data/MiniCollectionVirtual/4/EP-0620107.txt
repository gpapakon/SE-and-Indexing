<ABSTRACT>
For welding a tubular part (1) to a pipe stub (3) of a valve housing (2), the tubular part (1) is held in a receiving device (6) having an inner supporting part (7). After heating up a region on the outer circumference of the tubular part (1) and the end face of the pipe stub (3) contactlessly by heat radiation, a bolt (11) is pushed through a bore (17) by means of a wedge puller (10). Subsequently, the pipe stub (3) is pushed onto the bolt and pressed against the outer circumference of the tubular part (1), producing a solid welded joint free from beading on the inner contour.

Process for manufacturing an article from
thermoplastic material by welding a pipe connecting piece

(3) of a valve housing (2) to a tubular part (1), the
pipe connecting piece (3) being welded by an end face

onto the outer circumference of the tubular part (1),
characterized in that an annular region around a radial

bore (17) of the tubular part and the end face (18) of
the pipe connecting piece (3) are contactlessly heated by

thermal rays and the two parts are subsequently pressed
against each other for welding.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, before being pressed against each other, supporting

parts are arranged inside the tubular part and inside the
pipe connecting piece.
Plastic article comprising a pipe part and a
branching pipe part which can be shut off, manufactured

by the process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized
in that a valve housing (2) is firmly connected

by its pipe connecting piece (3) to the outer circumference
of the tubular part (1) by means of welding.
Article according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the longitudinal axis (19) of the valve housing (2)

is arranged perpendicularly with respect to the longitudinal
axis (9) of the tubular part (1).
Apparatus for carrying out the process according
to one of Claims 1 or 2, having a first receiving device,

arranged on a displaceable carriage, a second receiving
device for the tubular part and a heating device (20),

which can be swivelled in between, for contactlessly 
heating up the parts to be welded, characterized in that

the receiving device (6) for the tubular part (1) has an
inner supporting part (7) which corresponds to the inner

contour of the tubular part (1) and on which there is
arranged a bolt (11) which is displaceable transversely

with respect to the longitudinal axis (9) of the said
inner supporting part.
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the bolt (11) is displaceable by means of a wedge-drawing

device (10).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 5 or 6,
characterized in that the outside diameter of the bolt

(11) corresponds to the inside diameter of the pipe
connecting piece (3).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 5 to 7,
characterized in that the heating device (20) has a

concave radiating surface (21) on one aide and a convex
radiating surface (22) on the other side.
