<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for preparing thin, yeast-leavened 
dough crusts provides improved products with 

reduced fragility. The process comprises: preparing a 
dough, preferably including an antimycotic; holding the 

dough at a suitably low temperature which is effective 

to develop the dough while maintaining good forming 
characteristics; dividing the dough into weighed pieces; 

finally proofing the weighed dough pieces; pressing the 
weighed dough pieces between upper and lower, 

differentially-heated platens to form and condition a 
flat dough preform, the starch in the upper surface 

being partially gelatinized and the lower surface being 
strengthened. Preferably, the product baked and then 

packaged in a heat-sealed plastic covering.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an improved process for
preparing yeast-leavened dough crusts.Pre-baked dough crusts, available in simple
packaging at room temperature, have increased greatly in
popularity in recent years. Most grocery stores now
carry a variety of shapes, sizes and flavors. It has
been found recently that when manufacture of thin crusts
of this type is attempted, problems of both fragility
and oven spring are encountered when operating normally.
The problem of fragility can require slowing process
equipment or taking special precautions to reduce the
number of damaged crusts. The problem of oven spring
can cause wastage due to the unsightly and nonfunctional
products that result.There is a need for a process that will enable the
production of thin, yeast-leavened crusts with fewer
problems caused by fragile or misshapen crusts.The art of preparing pre-baked, yeast-leavened
crusts has developed to the extent that the process can
be highly automated and produce the crusts at high 
rates. Automatic equipment is employed at various
stages of production, but thin crusts present special
problems and can slow down the equipment.In U. S. Patent 3,379,141, Groth discloses a method
for forming pizza shells which uses a press to impart
flaky characteristics to a low-shortening dough (column
3, lines 43-44). A dough ball is placed on an aluminum
plate on a conveyer for transport to a pressing station
and then to an oven for baking. At the pressing
station, an upper die moves down to press the dough
against the plate. The pressing causes the dough to
adhere to the aluminum plate, which is cooled to room
temperature before pressing. The upper die is heated to
above about 200°F [about 93.3°C] (column 4, line 2) prior
to pressing. The patent disclosure does not address the
preparation of the dough and is silent about the
problems of oven spring and dough preform fragility that
are experienced when dealing with thin crusts.In U. S. Patent 3,565,015, Jorgensen discloses a
pizza dough press including a conveyor that moves dough
pieces intermittently between heated upper and lower
platens of a forming die. The lower platen supports the
conveyor from below while the upper platen forces the
dough against the belt and confines it to a specific
size and shape as it is pressed and heated. Each of the
upper and lower platens is provided with a
thermostatically-controlled heating element that
partially bakes the dough. The details of forming and
baking are not disclosed; and the problems of oven
spring and fragility,

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a flat, yeast-leavened dough crust,
comprising:


preparing a dough by combining dough forming ingredients
comprising water, flour, and yeast in proportions sufficient to fully

hydrate the flour, and mixing to partially develop the dough;
holding the dough at a temperature and for a time effective to
develop the dough while maintaining good forming characteristics;
dividing the dough into weighed pieces;
finally proofing the weighed dough pieces;
pressing the weighed dough pieces for a time period of from 2 to
10 seconds between upper and lower heated platens to form and

condition a flat dough preform, the upper platen being maintained at
a temperature within the range of from 70° to 110°C to partially

gelatinize the surface of the dough in contact therewith, and the
lower platen being heated to a temperature of from 150° to 250°C

to sufficiently gelatinize the starch, set the gluten and reduce the
moisture of the surface in contact therewith to increase the strength

of the dough preform during conveying and subsequent processing.
A process according to claim 1, wherein the temperature of the
dough during mixing and holding prior, to dividing, is maintained at below

24°C.
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the ingredients
for preparing the dough include an antimicrobial agent. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
ingredients for preparing the dough further include, salt, sugar, cheese,

edible oil, and an antimycotic.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the
dough is pressed to a uniform thickness of 4 to 9 mm.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the
dough is pressed to a uniform thickness of 5 to 7 mm.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the
dough is held at a temperature below 24°C for a time period of at least

15 minutes which is effective to develop the dough while maintaining
good forming characteristics.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the
dough preform is baked under conditions effective to brown the exterior

of the dough pieces and set the internal crumb structure.
A process according to claim 8, wherein, following baking, the
baked crust has a uniform thickness of 8 to 15 mm.
A process according to any one of claims 7 to 9, wherein
following baking, the baked crust has a uniform thickness of 10 to 1 2

mm.
A process according to any one of claims 7 to 10, wherein
following baking, the baked crust is packaged in a heat-sealed plastic

covering.
