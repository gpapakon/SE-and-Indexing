<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, a structure for advancing 
print media (90) through a print zone of a printer, the 

structure being subjected to heat during operation of the 
printer, gives good traction between the structure and the 

print media (90). The structure provides a high accuracy 
print media drive for open loop printing. Traction is 

maintained through a range of temperatures, for a range of 
print media drag forces and over a long period of use. 

The structure includes one or more pinch rollers (102), 
one or more drive rollers (100) against which a 

corresponding pinch roller (102) exerts a contact force 
and a means for rotating the one or more drive rollers 

(100). Each drive roller (100) is coated with a material 
that provides good traction over a range of operational 

temperatures without requiring an undesirably large 
contact force between the pinch 
roller (102) and drive 
roller (100) that may result in visible surface markings 

being formed on the print media (90). Good traction is 
maintained over a range of print media drag forces 

throughout the life of the printer. Each drive roller 
(102) can be coated with a metal thermal spray. The metal 

thermal spray can be a plasma sprayed tungsten carbide. 
The spray can include a bonding agent to enhance the 

bonding between the coating and the drive roller (102). 
The structure according to the invention can 

advantageously be used with a thermal inkjet printer and, 
in particular, with thermal inkjet printers in which the 

resolution of the printer is greater than 200 dots/inch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to 
the U.S. patent No. 5406316 entitled 
"Airflow System for Inkjet Printer," 
filed by William Schwiebert et al. on the same date as the 
present application, and assigned to the same assignee as 
the present application. This invention relates to thermal printers and, in 
particular, to a structure for advancing print media 
through a print zone of the printer, the structure being 
subjected to heat during operation of the printer. Most 
particularly, the invention relates to coating a surface 
of a printer drive roller to obtain good traction between 
the drive roller and the print media such that uniform 
travel of the print media is obtained. In an inkjet printer, a print carriage includes one 
or more print cartridges in which an ink reservoir is 
formed to hold a particular color of ink. Each print 
cartridge also includes a printhead having a plurality of 
nozzles through which ink is ejected. The ink is ejected 
either through use of a piezoelectric transducer or by 
heating the ink with a resistor so that a vapor bubble 
forms and forces ink out through the nozzles onto the 
portion of the print media that is in the print zone 
(i.e., area of the print media onto which ink can be 
ejected at any given time). The print carriage is moved 
laterally back and forth, and the print media is advanced  
 
past the print carriage to enable printing of a desired 
image or images on the print media. It is desirable to achieve high throughput (i.e., 
linear travel of the print media through the printer per 
unit time) in a printer. However, in previous attempts to 
achieve high throughput in inkjet printers, distortion of 
the print media, such as cockling (i.e., print media 
wrinkling associated with the absorption and drying of the 
liquid ink on the print media), has been a problem. As a 
result, it has been necessary to use a heater to heat 
portions of the print media prior to and during the time 
that the portions of the print media are in the print 
zone. In a high throughput printer, there is only a 
relatively short period of time to transfer heat to the 
print media. Thus, a high thermal output heater is 
required. Integrating a print media drive system (i.e., a 
structure for advancing the print media through the print 
zone) with high thermal output heating of the print media 
has been difficult. In one possible approach, a push 
drive structure is constructed outside the heat zone to 
advance the print media through the print zone. In 
another possible approach, a

<CLAIMS>
A structure for advancing print media (90) through a 
print zone (104) of a printer, the printer including means 

for heating the print media during printing such that the 
structure is subjected to heat during operation of the 

printer, the structure comprising: 

a pinch roller (102); 
a drive roller (100) including a tungsten carbide 
coating material that is plasma sprayed on the drive roller; 
means for biasing the pinch roller against the drive 
roller such that the pinch roller (102) exerts a contact 

force on the drive roller; and 
means for rotating the drive roller so that the print 
media (90) can be drawn between the drive roller (100) and 

pinch roller (102) such that the coating material contacts 
the print media as the print media pass between the drive 

roller and pinch roller, wherein: 
the coating material has a composition and particle size 
such that, for a range of print media drag forces between 0 

and 150 grams, when the contact force exerted by the pinch 
roller on the drive roller is approximately 1000 grams, the 

traction loss of the print media (90) is less than 0.05%, 
and such that the coating material has a bond strength 

sufficient to withstand thermal stresses arising from 
differential thermal expansion of the drive roller and 

coating material resulting from heating of the structure.

the printer is greater than 200 dots/inch.

width of the drive roller (100) is made sufficiently small 

so that the drive roller provides substantially no shielding
