<ABSTRACT>
What is proposed is a device for automatically gripping and closing the sleeve of an article of clothing which is slipped onto an ironing bust and is loaded with air from the inside and which has a clamp for closing the sleeve at the end, for positioning on the sleeve the clamp (11) being displaceable along a rail (2) which is itself pivotable about a vertical and a horizontal axis, and each direction of movement being assigned a proximity switch (15-17) which records the edge of the sleeve, with the result that the respective movement stops and, when the end position is reached, the clamp (11) closes.
