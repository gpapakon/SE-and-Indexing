<ABSTRACT>
Cardiac valve, so called heart valve, comprising a sleeve or ring having an inlet end and an outlet end and which is provided with a central opening (4), and openable and closable flaps having for their purpose to allow flow of blood through the central opening (4) in one direction, the flaps (9a-c) being designed as circle segments, where the sector angle designated  alpha  has the value 360 DEG /n, where n is the number of circle segments and is 3, 4, 5 or 6, said flaps (9a-c) being at their outer edges pivotably connected to the inside of the ring (3) at said inlet end thereof, in that each flap (9a-c) is connected to the ring (3) by means of a hinge which is arranged in the center of the outer edge of the flap and which is accommodated in a recess in said ring (3), whereby said flaps in a closed position cooperate to form a sealing body and in an open position allow a free passage of blood.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a back valve, more
particularly a cardiac valve, so called heart valve, intended
to allow flow of blood in one direction in a path
of blood in connection to the heart of a living mammal,
including man.Cardiac valves, so called heart valves, are found in
a number of embodiments made both of wholly artificial materials,
such as titanium, pyrolytic carbon or the like,
or manufactured from natural tissue of porcine or bovine
origin, said materials being treated in a chemical manner
so as to obtain desirable properties. All hitherto known
back valves for such intended function are associated with
severe disadvantages, among which the following may be
mentioned.The designs not based on natural tissue are all made
as more or less complicated constructions which result in
risk of failure or unsatisfactory function in other ways.
Known valves are, furthermore, designed so as to occupy,
in an open position, an essential part of the flow cross-section,
thus offering resistance to the flow of blood.
Many of the known valves are furthermore designed in an
asymmetric way with concomitant inconveniences. Furthermore,
the prior art cardiac valves have a design where
protruding parts disturb the flow of blood and also result
in undesired epithelial growth. Finally, it can be mentioned
that known valves often are associated with inertia in
their opening or closing movement which substantially reduces
their efficiency.Examples of prior art designs are found in US patents
Nos. 4,820,299 and 5,078,739. These known cardiac valves
are subject to the disadvantages indicated above. The present invention has for a purpose to provide a
cardiac valve, wherein the disadvantages of the prior art
are eliminated or at any rate essentially reduced.Another object of the invention is to provide a cardiac
valve which in an open position offers low resistance
to the flow of blood in view of the fact that the opening
ratio, i.e. the ratio between the open valve passage and
the cross-section in association with the valve position,
is high.Yet another object of the invention is to provide a
valve showing a symmetric opening pattern, so that the
flow of blood will not be disturbed in a non-desirable
manner.Still another object of the invention is to provide a
cardiac valve having the capability of rapid opening and
closing resulting in improved efficiency.Another object of the invention is to provide a cardiac
valve having a minimum of protruding parts whereby
undesired epithelial growth is prevented or at

<CLAIMS>
Cardiac valve, so called heart valve, comprising
a sleeve or ring which is provided with a central opening

(4), and openable and closeable flaps having for their
purpose to allow flow of blood though the central opening

(4) in one direction, wherein the flaps (9a-c) are designed
as circle segments, where the sector angle (α) has

the value 360°/n, where n is the number of circle segments
and is 3, 4, 5 or 6, said flaps (9a-c) being at

their outer edge pivotably connected to the inside of the
ring (3) at one end thereof, in that each flap (9a-c) is

connected to the ring (3) by means of a hinge which is
arranged in the center of the outer edge of the flap and

which is accommodated in a recess in said ring (3),
whereby said flaps in a closed position

co-operate to form a sealing body and in an open position
allow a free passage of blood, characterized in

that the flaps (9a-c) are arcuate so as to form together
in the closed position a cone having an obtuse peak angle

(β) 
and

in that each hinge contains a pin or stud (15) which is
attached to the ring (3) in a tangentially extending aperture

(17) therein.
Cardiac valve according to claim 1, characterized
in that the number of flaps (9a-c) is 3.
Cardiac valve according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that said peak angle (β) is at most 180°.
Cardiac valve according to claim 3, characterized
in that said peak angle (β) lies within the range about

150 to 175°.
Cardiac valve according to any preceding claim,
characterized in that the attachment to the ring (3) is

shaped in such a manner that one flap (9a-c) alone cannot
be folded to a position substantially exceeding the position

it has in co-operation with the other flaps (9a-c).
Cardiac valve according to any preceding claim,
characterized in that the ring (3) at the ends thereof is

provided with circumferential flanges (5) forming a recess 
(7), wherein a suture ring can be placed for fixation

to the surrounding tissue.
Cardiac valve according to any preceding claim,
characterized in that the ring (3) at said one end

thereof is provided with an inwardly directed circumferential
flange (19), the outer edges of flaps (9a-c) sealingly

engaging the inwardly facing side surface of said flange
(19).
Cardiac valve according to any preceding claim,
wherein said flaps (9a-c) in a fully open position take

an angle (γ) to a line parallel with a center line (L) to
said ring (3) which is greater than zero and smaller than

about 7°.
Cardiac valve according to any preceding claim,
characterized in that it is made of a material selected

from titanium and pyrolytic carbon.
