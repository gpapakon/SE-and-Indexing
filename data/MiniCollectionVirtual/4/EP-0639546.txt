<ABSTRACT>
A preferably pulverulent fertiliser is mixed with a biodegradable, plastifiable, particulate material, the mixture of fertiliser and material is heated, preferably in an extruder, plastified and extruded. The material is an NWR-based polymer which decomposes in moist soil within a period which can be predetermined by selecting the type of the material, during which process the enclosed fertiliser particles are gradually released. The mixture of fertiliser and material is used for manufacturing fertiliser rodlets which can be driven into the soil, for example by means of a striking tool, and plant pots.
