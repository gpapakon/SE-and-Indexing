<ABSTRACT>
This inverter enables the input of a folder-inserter (4) to be coupled, via a very simple transporter (3), to the output of a printer (2) of a text processing system (1), whilst this printer provides pages printed in an order which is not suitable for direct insertion into envelopes (44). This inverter (5) comprises a random-access memory (54) storing the string of binary words representing the text of a letter, in tempo with the provision thereof by the text processing system (1), by labelling the address of each start of a page of the text. These binary words are retrieved page by page, in the inverse order of the pages of the text, but each page being retrieved whilst adhering to the initial order of the characters constituting it. Application to folder-inserters for preparing mail.

<CLAIMS>
An electronic page order inverter for a mail treatment system
comprising a word processor system (1), a sheet fed printer (2), and a

folder-inserter (4), the inverter being designed to be coupled electrically
between the word processor system and the printer, and comprising means

(50, 53, 54) for recording a sequence of binary words representing the
alphanumeric characters of a letter as they are delivered by the word

processor system, characterised in that the inverter comprises means (50,
53, 54) for inserting in the sequence of binary words a first control code at

the beginning of each page of the letter, and a second control code at the
end of the last page of the fetter, said first and second control codes

constituting instructions to the inverter, and means (50, 53, 54) for
recognizing said first and second control codes in the recorded sequence of

binary words for the purpose of playing back said recorded binary words to
the printer, letter page by letter page in inverse order of letter pages while

keeping the characters making up each page in their initial order.
An inverter according to claim 1, further including an alarm
device (52) to warn the user of the mail processing system whenever the

number of stored pages exceeds a predetermined threshold.
A mail processing system comprising a word processor
system (1), a sheet-fed printer (2); a folder-inserter (4) mechanically

coupled to the printer, for the purposes of: receiving sheets on which the
printer has printed the text of a letter; folding said sheets; and inserting

them in an envelope; and an electronic inverter according to one of claims 1
or 2 having input/output interfaces connected to the word processor system,

to the printer, and to the folder-inserter in order to coordinate operation
thereof.
A system according to claim 3, in which the folder-inserter (4)
is mechanically coupled to the printer (2) by a conveyor comprising a

sloping plane (31) and at least one roller (32) driven by a motor.
A folder-inserter including an electronic inverter according to
one of claims 1 or 2.
