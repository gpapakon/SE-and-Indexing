<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mobile communication apparatus 
having a recording/reproducing function. The object is to 

record a greater amount of speech by recording a voice with a 
reduced amount of memory and to reproduce the recorded 

signals into original voices, when loading a 
recording/reproducing function into the mobile communication 

apparatus. There is provided a recording/reproducing section 
(10) capable of recording either digital speech signals 

compressed in a digital speech signal processing section (5) 
provided in the mobile communication apparatus which 

digitally performs a communication or compressed digital 
speech data transmitted from the other party in communication 

by way of a base station. The thus recorded compressed 
digital speech data may be supplied to the digital speech 

signal processing section (5) for the reproducing on the side 
of the local central office or may be transmitted to the base 

station for the reproduction on the side of the other party 
in communication.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication 
apparatus capable of recording or reproduction. Fig. 19 is a block diagram showing a conventional mobile 
communication apparatus using digital speech signals for 
communication, for example, a digital portable telephone. In 
Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 denotes a microphone which 
supplies speech signals to the mobile communication 
apparatus; 2 denotes an A/D converter for converting analog 
speech signals into digital speech signals; 3 is a 
loudspeaker for performing speech output for the mobile 
communication apparatus; 4 is a D/A converter for converting 
digital speech signals into analog speech signals; and 5 
denotes a digital speech signal processing section for 
compressing the digital speech signals derived from the A/D 
converter 2 and for expanding the received compressed digital 
speech data, which can be, for example, a speech codec. 
Reference numeral 6 designates a time division multiplex 
timing control section for timing adjustment which is time 
division multiplex accessed. Reference numeral 7 signifies a 
control section for controlling the digital speech signal 
processing section 5 and the time division multiplex access 
timing control section 6. The operation thereof will be described hereinafter. In the 
diagram, when transmitting speech data, analog speech signals 
which have been input in the form of speech through the 
Microphone 1 are converted into digital speech signals by the 
A/D converter 2. The thus obtained digital signals are 
supplied to the digital speech signal processing section 5  
 
for signal processing. In the digital speech signal 
processing section 5, the digital speech signals are 
compressed to obtain a lower bit rate. The compressed digital 
speech data are then output with error correction codes 
attached thereto. For example, the North American digital mobile phone employs 
as a digital speech signal processing section 5 a speech 
codec which compresses the digital speech signals to a coding 
rate in the order of 8 kbps (actually a coding rate is 7,95 
kbps and total coding rate is 13 kbps when an error 
correcting code is added). In the time division multiplex 
access timing control section 6, the digital speech signals 
compressed in the digital speech signal processing section 5 
under the control of the control section 7 are subjected to 
the adjustment of timing and supplied with control signals 
for the formation of multiplexing signals. The multiplexing 
signals are radio transmitted to a
