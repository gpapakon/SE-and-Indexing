<ABSTRACT>
The relevant data on the link quality at different sites within a coverage area of a mobile radio system to be monitored are registered by mobile test instruments (16) which preferably communicate with vehicles which regularly carry out trips in the area along random paths (20). The mobile test instruments (16) acquire and store the call identification and connection parameters and the time and site data. Analysis is carried out via a control device (17) which is connected to a mobile switching centre (15).

<CLAIMS>
A method to ascertain the quality of service in a mobile 
radio installation with at least one base transceiver 

station and a multitude of mobile subscriber sets, 
whereby by means of at least one test mobile remote unit 

(16) which among other things is able to determine 
location and clock time, and a test control unit (17) 

which among other things is able to determine at least 
the clock time, calls between the test mobile remote 

unit (16) and the test control unit (17) or between test 
mobile remote units (16) are initiated and terminated 

again according to programmed settings, call 
identification parameters and call connection parameters 

as well as location and clock time data are stored on 
both sides, the stored data are periodically transferred 

to the test control unit (17), evaluated and issued, 
characterised in that a test mobile remote unit (16) is 

taken along in each instance by a carrier who is in a 
statistically significant way frequently moving at 

random along certain routes (20) whereby calls are made 
automatically in defined temporal and/or local spacings. 
A method according to claim 1 whereby several test 
mobile remote units (16) are set up on several different 

vehicles which often circulate along routes through 
territories with a high amount of call traffic. 
A method according to claim 1 whereby several test 
mobile remote units (16) are set up on several different 

vehicles which in their totality circulate in a 
particular territory, essentially equally distributed 

and covering the entire area.  
 
A method according to claim 1 whereby calls are 
initiated on the basis of locational settings in the 

test mobile remote unit (16), depending on the 
respective location determined. 
A method according to claim 1 whereby transferring of 
the data stored in the test mobile remote unit (16) and 

the data necessary for programming the call settings 
takes place by radio. 
A method according to claim 1 or 5 whereby the result of 
a statistical evaluation is used to adapt the call 

settings. 
A method according to claim 1 whereby the call 
identification parameters and call connection parameters 

of the calls initiated by the test mobile remote unit 
(16) in addition to the calls initiated by the test 

program are also acquired, transferred and evaluated. 
A method according to claim 1, applied to a cellular 
mobile radio system, whereby cellular radio specific 

parameters, in particular base station identification 
and any intercellular handover that might take place, 

are also acquired.
