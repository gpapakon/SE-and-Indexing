<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a composition for sheets of a high water absorption, which consists of a polymer of a high 
water absorption, fiber 
and alkylene oxide polymer. The composition consisting of a polymer of a high water absorption, fiber 
and alkylene oxide polymer according to the present invention is characterized in that the polymer of a high water absorption and 

the fiber are bonded together by the alkylene oxide polymer, and this composition is in a porous sponge-like form. The present 
invention also relates to a composition for sheets of a high water absorption which is obtained by adding a filter aid to the above 

composition. The present invention further relates to a human waste treating agent consisting of such a composition. According 
to the present invention, a composition for sheets of a high water absorption, having a high water absorption rate per unit area 

and superior initial high-speed water absorption and capable of being cut to various shapes easily, and human waste treating 
agent consisting of such a composition can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition for
superabsorbent gelling sheets to be used for the excrement
disposal in an artificial anus, a night chair and the like.It is known that disposing of the excrement
collected in an artificial anus, an artificial bladder, a
urine glass, a night chair, etc. is facilitated by putting in
advance superabsorbent polymers in these containers for the
purpose of solidifying the excrement. (Japanese Published
Unexamined Utility Model Application No. 72998/1984). A
disadvantage of disposing of the excrement in this manner is
that the superabsorbent polymers in the form of particles or
powders become gel in the container and the gel does not fully
absorb water when contacted with muddy feces containing a
large amount of solids. The disposal capacity is thus
unsatisfactory. In order to make up for this disadvantage,
attempts have been made to develop a superabsorbent gelling
sheet by the dry process. Solid superabsorbent polymers are
molded into sheets by injection to prepare a superabsorbent
polymer composition (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent
Application Nos. 67127/1985 and 2918/1987). Solid
superabsorbent polymers are sandwiched between two sheets of
paper comprising water-soluble resin and pulp fibers to
prepare superabsorbent sheet materials (Japanese Published
Unexamined Patent Application No. 2918/1987).A superabsorbent sheet prepared by the injection
molding method is easy to cut into desirably shaped pieces and
absorbs a comparatively large amount of water per unit area,
but it is not so good in water absorption capacity in the 
initial stage. On the other hand, a superabsorbent sheet
prepared by the sandwich method absorbs water rapidly in the
initial stage but its water absorption capacity per unit area
is not so good. Moreover, it is not so good in retaining the
absorbed water in the superabsorbent polymers.The present invention relates to a composition for
superabsorbent gelling sheets which composition comprises
superabsorbent polymers, fiber and polyalkylene oxide. The
polyalkylene oxide bridges the space between the
superabsorbent polymers and fibers so that the composition
takes the form of porous sponge. The present invention also
relates to a composition for superabsorbent gelling sheet
which composition is obtained by supplementing the above-mentioned
composition with a filter aid. Further, the present
invention relates to a material for the excrement disposal,
composed of the above-mentioned compositions.An object of the present invention is
