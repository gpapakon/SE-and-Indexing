<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light-emitting
material for an organic electroluminescence device (to be
sometimes referred to as "EL device" hereinafter) used as a
flat light source or a flat display device, and an EL device
having a high brightness.An EL device using an organic substance is
overwhelmingly expected to be usable as a solid light-emitting
inexpensive large-screen, full-color display device, and
devices are being developed in many ways. Generally, an EL
device is composed of a light-emitting layer and a pair of
mutually opposite electrodes sandwiching the light-emitting
layer. Light emission is the following phenomenon. When an
electric field is applied to these two electrodes, the cathode
injects electrons into the light-emitting layer and the anode
injects holes into the light-emitting layer. When the
electrons recombine with the holes in the light-emitting layer,
their energy level shifts to a valence bond band to release
energy as fluorescent light.As compared with inorganic EL devices, conventional
organic EL devices require high voltage, and their light
emission brightness and light emission efficiency are low.
Further, conventional organic EL devices deteriorate in
properties to a great extent, and no organic EL device has been
put to practical use.There has been recently proposed an organic EL device 
which is produced by laminating a thin film containing an
organic compound having a fluorescent quantum effect of
emitting light at a low voltage as low as less than 10 V, and
it attracts attention (Appl. Phy. Lett., Vol. 51, page 913,
1987).The above organic EL device has a light-emitting
layer containing a metal chelate complex and a hole-injecting
layer containing an amine-based compound, and emits green light
having a high brightness. The above organic EL device achieves
nearly practically usable performance, since it accomplishes
a brightness of thousands cd/m2 and a maximum light emission
efficiency of 1.5 lm/W when a direct current voltage of 6 or
7V is applied.However, conventional organic EL devices including
the above organic EL device are not yet sufficient in brightness
improved in brightness to some extent, and their big problem
is that they are insufficient in light emission stability in
their continuous operation for a long period of time. It is
because, for example, the metal chelate complex such as
tris(8-hydroxyquinolinate)aluminum complex is chemically
unstable when light is emitted by the application of an electric
field and because the metal chelate complex is
