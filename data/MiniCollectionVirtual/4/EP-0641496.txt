<DESCRIPTION>
A differential protection is a type of protection used for 
preventing damage which may arise in connection with internal 
faults on busbars, generators, motors, transformers, 
power lines, etc. The requirements on the protections are somewhat different 
depending on the object to be protected. An unwanted 
protective function must be prevented and this can be done 
by stabilizing the protections. This means that attempts are 
made to make the protections unsusceptible to certain 
internal and external electrical transients and to external 
electrical faults. It is necessary, for example, to prevent 
that inrush current surges, overmagnetization currents, 
continuous currents, saturation of current transformers, 
etc., lead to an unwanted protective function. However, 
there is always a certain risk that the stabilization 
measures are insufficient in the case of external faults. The present invention relates to a special stabilizing 
problem which may arise in a longitudinal differential 
protection when current transformers included in the 
protection become saturated owing to an external fault, that 
is, when the protection is to be stabilized so as not to 
enter into operation. Figure 1 shows, in principle, how, according to the state of 
the art, a differential protection changes its degree of 
stabilization when current transformer saturation occurs.  
 Figure 2 shows how, according to the invention, the basis 
for determining the current differential and stabilizing 
currents is changed when current transformer saturation 
occurs. The stabilization measures for longitudinal differential 
protections for different fault conditions have been 
described in a large number of patent specifications. A 
relatively comprehensive description of the prior art is 
given in patent application SE 9200406-8. From this it is 
clear, inter alia, that known problems in connection with 
differential protections are that they exhibit deficiencies 
with respect to stability for external faults and for 
networks with a large short-circuit power. In addition, 
false difference currents may arise in case of external 
faults because some of the current transformers become 
saturated. However, current transformer saturation may be 
detected in accordance with several known methods, see, for 
example, SE 9100917-5. Information that saturation has 
occurred may be used for stabilization of a differential 
protection, which, however, entails a certain risk of both 
overstabilization in case of an internal fault and

A method for preventing understabilization of longitudinal 
differential protections in case of external faults 

and current transformer saturation, which method comprises 
an extension of a method wherein the measured, sampled 

currents of the longitudinal differential protection, 
obtained via current transformers (C1, C2, ... Cn) and A/D 

converters (1, 2, 3), are filtered by means of Fourier 
filters (4, 5, 6) for producing the Fourier amplitudes (A1, 

A2, ... An) and phase angles (ϕ1, ϕ2, ... ϕn) of the 
respective current vectors, and after synchronization the 

phase angles together with the Fourier amplitudes are used 
for determining the function characteristic of the 

longitudinal differential protection, and the sampled 
currents are also used for detecting whether any current 

transformer has become saturated and if this is the case, 
the stabilizing degree (S) included in the function 

characteristic is increased, the method according to the 
extension being 
characterized
 in that the peak values 
(A11, A21, ... An1) of the sampled currents are determined 

with the aid of two consecutive sample values for each cycle 
and that the holding amplitudes (A11H, A21H, ... An1H) of 

the currents are determined as the last determined peak 
values consecutively stored in holding circuits, and that if 

one or more of the holding amplitudes is/are greater than 
the respective Fourier amplitude multiplied by a first 

constant (a) and if at the same time saturation has been 
detected, the Fourier amplitude is multiplied by a second 

constant (KA) into a higher value (A1k, A2k, ... Ank) and 
the phase angle is reduced by a phase change (Δϕ) into a 

lower value (ϕ1k, ϕ2k, ... ϕnk) and that the values of 
Fourier amplitude and phase angle thus corrected are used 

for determining a corrected function characteristic.

determined peak values, comparison means (23, 24, 25) for 
determining the inequalities of the holding amplitudes in 

relation to the Fourier amplitudes multiplied by a first 
constant (a) and, if the inequality is true while at the 

same time current transformer saturation is detected, the 
Fourier amplitudes are adapted to be multiplied in amplitude 

correction units (34, 35, 36) by a second constant (KA) and 
the phase angles are adapted to be reduced in angle correction 

units (30, 31, 32) by a given phase change (Δϕ) and 
that the corrected Fourier amplitudes (A1k, A2k, ... Ank)
