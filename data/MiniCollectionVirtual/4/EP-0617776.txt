<ABSTRACT>
A self-sealing coupling comprising two coupling parts (1 and 2) each having an obturating member (3, 6) which seals automatically when the coupling parts (1 and 2) are disconnected, and a ring seal (5, 8) which mates in a fluid tight manner with the corresponding ring seal (5, 8) of the other coupling part (1, 2) when the coupling is engaged. The obturating member (6) has a conical elastomeric face seal (7) which is relaxed when the coupling is made and the two obturating members (3 and 6) are displaced to one side of the mating ring seals (5 and 8) for fluid flow. The arrangement is such that the conical face seal (7) is flattened by the thrust that reseats the two obturating members (3 and 6) so that the tapering annular clearance between it and the flat face of the obturating member (3) is taken up and fluid between the obturating members (3 and 6) is squeezed out to a location upstream of the ring seals (5 and 8).

<DESCRIPTION>
 COUPLINGSDESCRIPTIONThis invention relates to a coupling for connecting together two fluid passages and through which fluid is to be transferred from one of the passages to the other, the coupling being of the kind which comprises two coupling parts, each of which forms a respective one of the two fluid passages and is provided with an obturating member operable to close the respective fluid passage automatically, in a fluid tight manner, when the respective coupling part is disconnected from a mating coupling part, and actuating means operable to effect decoupling and fluid tight coupling of the two coupling parts and to apply a thrust to said obturating members during coupling so that the obturating members are displaced from their positions in which they close the respective through passages to allow fluid flow around the displaced obturating members from one passage to the other, and to return the obturating members to said positions for decoupling. GB-A-1218941 discloses such a coupling.An object of the invention is to provide a sealing arrangement for a coupling of the kind referred to above which allows the coupling to be readily decoupled and which enables substantial elimination from the interfaces of the coupling and its sealing arrangement, prior to separation of the coupling parts, of any residual traces of the fluid product that is transferred from one of the fluid passages toSUBSTITUTESHEET 

 the other, so that the coupling is suitable for use for the transfer of light petroleum products or other volatile or noxious fluids.According to this invention there is provided a coupling of the kind referred to above wherein one of the obturating members has a face which is adjacent to a corresponding face of the other obturating member as those obturating members are displaced from said positions by said actuating means when the coupling parts are coupled together, said face of said one obturating member being formed of an elastomeric material and being profiled in its natural relaxed state such that, when it touches the adjacent face of the other obturating member without deformation of the elastomeric material, a radially extending tapering clearance is formed between those faces, said actuating means being adapted to apply an axial thrust through one of the obturating members to the other whereby the elastomeric material is compressed so that the clearance is taken up and fluid between those faces is squeezed out as the obturating members return to said positions prior to disconnection of the

 CLAIMS
1. A coupling for connecting together two fluid passages and through which fluid is to be transferred from one of the passages to the other, the coupling being of the kind which comprises two coupling parts (1 and 2), each of which forms a respective one of the two fluid passages and is provided with an obturating member (3,6) operable to close the respective fluid passage automatically, in a fluid tight manner, when the respective coupling part (1,2) is disconnected from a mating coupling part (1,2), actuating means operable to effect decoupling and fluid tight coupling of the two coupling parts (1 and 2) and to apply a thrust to said obturating members (3 and 6) during coupling so that the obturating members (3 and 6) are displaced from their positions in which they close the respective through passages to allow fluid flow around the displaced obturating members (3 and 6) from one passage to the other, and to return the obturating members (3 and 6) to said positions for decoupling, wherein one (6) of the obturating members (3 and 6) has a face (7) which is adjacent to a corresponding face (4) of the other obturating member (3) as those obturating members (3 and 6) are displaced from said positions by said actuating means when the coupling parts (1 and 2) are coupled together, characterised in that said face (7) of said one obturating member (6) is formed of an elastomeric material and is profiled in its natural relaxed state, such that, when it touches the adjacent face (4) of the other obturating
SUBSTITUTE SHEET 


 member (3) without deformation of the elastomeric material, a radially extending tapering clearance is formed between those faces (4 and 7), said actuating means being adapted to apply an axial thrust through one (3) of the obturating members (3 and 6) to the other (6) whereby the elastomeric material is compressed so that the clearance is taken up and fluid between those faces (4 and 7) is squeezed out as the obturating members (3 and 6) return to said positions prior to disconnection of the coupling parts (1 and 2), the elastomeric material of said one obturating member (6) being in its natural relaxed state when the coupling parts (1 and 2) have been coupled together and the obturating members (3 and 6) have been displaced by said actuating means to rest positions which they occupy as fluid is transferred around them from one of the through passages to the other.
2. A coupling according to claim 1 comprising a pair of ring seals (5 and 8) on a peripheral joint of the coupling parts (1 and 2) and a pair of disc seals (4 and 7) on the adjacent faces of the obturating members (3 and 6) .
3. A coupling according to claim 2, wherein the profiles of said seals (4,5,7 and 8) are so arranged that, in the purging sequence of the seal operation during which the profiled elastomeric material of one (7) of the disc seals is deformed to squeeze out fluid from between the adjacent faces of the disc seals (4 and 7) , annular clearances between the obturating members (3 and 6) and the ring seals (5 and 8) are progressivly closed forcing any such residual fluid back past one of the two disc seals (4 and 7) and into one of the two through passages before seating of the

A coupling according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein each ring seal (5,8) protrudes with respect to the respective face seal (4,7) when the coupling parts (1 and 2) are disconnected so that, upon engagement of the coupling, the ring seals (5 and 8) come into pressure tight contact before the obturating member face seals (4,7) contact.
8. A coupling according to any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the geometry of the coupling is arranged so that, when the coupling parts (1 and 2) are engaged, the pressure between the ring seals (5 and 8) is greater than the pressure between the face seals (4 and 7) which in turn is greater than the fluid pressure upstream of the ring seals (5 and 8).
