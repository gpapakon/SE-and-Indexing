<ABSTRACT>
A freshness retaining device for a refrigerator. This device supplies magnetized 
air to all of sections of the refrigerating chamber, thus to activate tissue of the chilled 

food in the refrigerating chamber and to retain the freshness of the chilled food. The 
device includes a housing detachably mounted on an inner wall of the refrigerating 

chamber and having an air inlet pipe and an outlet and a water reservoir provided in the 
housing. An ultrasonic humidifier is connected to the water reservoir and generates an 

ultrasonic wave for decomposition of the water of the reservoir into water molecules. A 
blower fan is connected to a motor and mounted above the ultrasonic humidifier. The fan 

forcibly introduces the water molecules to the outlet of the housing. A magnetic field 
generator is mounted at the front of the blower fan and magnetizes the water molecules. 

The device also includes a power source unit for supplying an electric power to all of the 
ultrasonic humidifier, the motor and the magnetic field generator. The magnetic field 

generator includes a plurality of magnets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a freshness retaining device for a
refrigerator and, more particularly to a freshness retaining device for retaining the
freshness of chilled food, such as vegetables, fruits, meat and fishes, using magnetic force.With reference to Fig. 1, there is shown a conventional refrigerator. As shown in
this drawing, a refrigerator body 21 is divided into two chambers, that is, a freezing
chamber 1a and a refrigerating chamber 1b. In addition, a vegetable container 23 is
provided on a lower section of the refrigerating chamber 1b. In order to retain the
freshness of chilled food such as vegetables, fruits, meat and fishes, the refrigerator
preferably includes a freshness retaining device in the refrigerating chamber 1b. The
conventional freshness retaining device comprises a rectangular magnet 24 which is
mounted on a lower section of the refrigerator body 21 such that it is spaced apart from
the bottom of the vegetable container 23 by a predetermined distance. The magnet 24 of
the freshness retaining device supplies magnetic energy to the chilled food (not shown)
in the vegetable container 23, thus to retain the freshness of the chilled food.The above freshness retaining device requires a magnetic energy source for
generating huge magnetic energy. However, it has been noted that it is not easy to find
out such a magnetic energy source and, furthermore, the magnetic energy generated by
such a magnetic energy source can not be applied to all of sections of the refrigerating 
chamber 1b. In this regard, the conventional freshness retaining device may fail in
retaining the freshness of the chilled food in the refrigerating chamber 1b.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a freshness retaining
device for a refrigerator in which the aforementioned problems can be overcome and
which supplies magnetized air to all of sections of the refrigerating chamber of the
refrigerator, thus to activate tissue of the chilled food in the refrigerating chamber and to
desirably retain the freshness of the chilled food.In order to accomplish the above object, there is provided a freshness retaining device for a
refrigerator in accordance with claim 1. Preferred embodiments are defined in
the dependent claims.The above and other objects, features and other advantages of the present
invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken
in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:
Fig. 1 is a schematic sectional view
