<ABSTRACT>
A dual time base, zero dead zone time domain reflectometer repetitively launches 
a predetermined number of stimulus pulses into a transmission 

system (18) in synchronism 
with clock signals from a first time base (10), providing 

a measurement cycle. The duration 
of the launched stimulus pulses, determined by a predetermined number clock cycles 

from the first time base, exceeds the total propagation time of the system to be measured 
so that a time interval between a launch and a reflection may be measured within the 

launched pulse. A second time base (24), which has a 
predetermined period that differs from 

the period of the first time base and defines a measurement period divided into equal 
sub-periods, continuously produces clock signals, one or more of which may be counted 

during the time interval. The result is that over a predetermined number of repetitive 
pulses launched and associated time intervals presented to the second time base and 

count logic circuits, a count signal will be produced for each incremental sub-period 
occurring during the time interval being measured. Accordingly, the total count is 

proportional to the duration of the time interval being measured. Since the measured 
time interval is produced by the launched pulse and its reflection, there is no dead zone. 

Also, the circuit design is very simple, and lends itself to manifestation in a low cost, low 
power, hand-held and battery operated TDR for locating faults on 10 base-T, Token Ring, 

T1, Telco lines, and other twisted-wire pair applications in local area networks, as well as 
general cable testing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to time domain reflectometers, and in particular to
a time domain reflectometer having a dual time base to provide high-resolution, zero dead
time measurement of reflection characteristics in all lengths of cables.A time domain reflectometer (TDR) is an instrument which indicates and measures
reflection characteristics of a transmission system by launching a signal into the
transmission path and measuring the length of time required to receive a reflection from
a discontinuity in the transmission path. Electrical TDRs measure and locate faults, such
as opens and shorts, in transmission lines such as cables and the like, and optical TDRs
similarly measure and locate faults, such as breaks and kinks, in fiber-optic filaments.Conventional high-resolution TDRs launch a short-duration pulse into a
transmission path and measure the length of time it takes to receive a reflection using a
high-speed clock and logic circuits. The distance D from the TDR to the fault (or
discontinuity caused by the end of a cable) is proportional to one-half the measured time
interval tm between the launched stimulus pulse and a reflected response. That is to say,
a pulse launched into a transmission system travels at a propagation velocity vp, which
is a percentage of the speed of light and is approximately equal to eight inches per
nanosecond (or 20 centimeters per nanosecond) in an electrical cable, through the
transmission system to a discontinuity and reflected therefrom back to the TDR, so that
D = vp · ½ tm. Thus, to resolve a measurement of the distance D to a fault in a cable (or
the length L of the cable) to within four inches (10 centimeters) using a conventional TDR
would require a measurement clock having a frequency of one gigahertz.As a practical matter, the power requirements and expense of high-speed clocks
preclude their use in most commercial TDR equipment, and so clock rates of around 100 
megahertz (MHz) are typical, resulting in typical resolutions of from two to four feet. This
sort of resolution may be adequate for cables that are several hundred feet in length;
however, when cable lengths of six or twelve feet are being measured, a resolution of
from two to four feet is inadequate. Also, TDRs having high-speed circuits are very
complex and difficult to interpret, are very expensive, and they consume large amounts
of power.Another problem associated with conventional TDRs is that the measurement
circuits are not sensitized to reflections for some brief period of time, e.g.,
