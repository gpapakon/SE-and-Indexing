<ABSTRACT>
The device set information to be displayed by pushbuttons (T) on a control panel, and displays it electronically on a display screen (A). An electronic circuit communicates with the pushbuttons and display, and may also accept (213) data from a smart card or similar device. The circuit and its peripherals are housed in a case (20). The case housing the unit is implemented in various forms to suit various positions in the vehicle. The case may be mounted inside the door of the vehicle, immediately below the window. In this form the case is mounted on pivots so it can be folded into a recess in the door or folded out to a horizontal position where the push buttons are accessible and the screen can be seen from outside. Alternative arrangements are to mount the unit on the steering column, glove box door or on a sun visor.

Device enabling information from an indicator (A) with 
a screen (E), used with the aid of a removable memory 

card (M), disposed inside a motor vehicle, and carried by 
an element (100) thereof, to be made visible from the 

exterior through an opening of the vehicle, the device 
being of the type comprising at least one control button 

(T), a support (10) which is intended to be fixed to the 
element (100) and is constituted by a base (11) defining 

a chamber (110), and retaining means (12) for its 
mounting on the element (100), a casing (20) which is 

intended to be mounted movably in the chamber (110) of 
the support (10) and is constituted by a body (21) with 

a seat (210) for housing the indicator (A), and which has 
a window (211) for allowing the screen (E) of the 

indicator (A) to be seen and at least one aperture (212) 
for the operation of the button (T), as well as a slot 

(213) for the insertion of the card (M), a guide 
mechanism (30) for fixing the casing (20) on the support 

(10) in order to permit a displacement thereof ending at 
a first position in which the screen (E) is visible from 

the exterior through the opening, an immobilizing 
arrangement (40) for keeping the casing (20) fixed 

relative to the support (10) in the said first position, 
and electrical connections (50) for connecting the 

indicator (A), characterized in that the casing (20) also 
has a gripping member (22) and an inspection flap (23), 

the button (T) also being visible from the exterior 
through the opening in the vehicle, the guide mechanism 

(30) permitting guiding with a predetermined path between 
a second position in which the screen (E) is practically 

invisible from the exterior of the vehicle through the  
 

opening and the first position, the immobilizing 
arrangement (40) also enabling the casing (20) to be 

supported relative to the support (10) in the said second 
position. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
guide mechanism (30) comprises at least one guide (31) 

and one finger (32) cooperating with the guide (31), of 
which one (31, 32) is carried by the support (10) and the 

other (31, 32) is carried by the casing (20). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
guide (31) comprises a bearing (310) and the finger (32) 

comprises a swivel pin (320) so as to render the casing 
(20) rotatable. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
guide (31) also comprises a ramp (311) on which the 

swivel pin (320) can move so as to render the casing (20) 
also translatable. 
Device according to either of Claims 3 and 4, 
characterized in that at least one of the bearing (310) 

and the swivel pin (320) is carried by a resilient plate 
(321). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the immobilizing arrangement (40) 

comprises abutments (41) for defining the second position 
of the casing (20) and a catch (42) for keeping the 

casing (20) in its first position. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in that the  
 

abutments (41) comprise a stop (411) on the base (11) of 
the support (10) and a bearing element (412) on the body 

(21) of the casing (20). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, of which 
the support (10) is intended to be fixed in a cut-out 

portion (101) formed in the element (100) and defining a 
place (102) for housing the support (10), characterized 

in that the retaining means (12) are at least one 
resilient tongue (121), or one edge (122). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the base (11) of the support (10) 

is constituted by two complementary, symmetrical half-frames 
(13) provided with assembly means (130). 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in that 
the assembly means (130) operate by resilient catching. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the base (11) of the support (10) 

has at least one hole (111) opening into the chamber 
(110) for the passage of the electrical connections (50). 
Device according to any one of Claims 2 to 11, 
characterized in that at least the finger (32) has a 

through-hole (322) opening in the seat (210) for the 
passage of the electrical connections (50). 
Device according to any one of Claims 6 to 12, 
characterized in that the gripping member (23) and the 

catch (42) are in one piece.  
 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the element (100) of the vehicle is 

a movable element selected from an inner door panel, a 
glove box lid, and a sun visor.
