<ABSTRACT>
An elastic body (10), used as a filler, esp. for cushions, mattresses, has one load bearing face (11) with adjacent lamellae (14) sepg. by slits (13). The lamellae (14) have different lengths and/or cross-section in different areas to ensure variation in springing characteristics and are connected to each other in the non-load bearing side of the body (10). In a claimed mfg. process the lamellae (12) are formed by making cuts (13) in the elastic material.

Filler body made from elastic material, particularly for upholstery and 
mattresses, 


with at least one surface side constructed as a load-absorbing bearing 
surface (11) and 
with structural elements provided in the bearing surface (11) interconnected 
in their base area (14) remote from the bearing surface (11), 
in which the structural elements are engaging lamellas (12), which are 
formed by separating slots (13) in the bearing surface (11) and 
the lamellas (12) are zonally constructed in the elastic material with 
variable length and/or variable cross-section, so that on loading a differentiated 

springing in behaviour occurs,
 
characterized in that 
the area of the bearing surface (11) with the lamellas (12) is surrounded 
by a marginal area (16), 
the marginal area (16) is made from an elastic material kept free from 
lamellas (12) and 
the elastic material has in the marginal area (16) a compressive strength 
higher than the compressive strength in the area of the bearing surface 

(11) with the lamellas (12). 
Filler body according to claim 1, characterized in that the compressive 

strength of the filler body (10) is continuously adjustable along the bearing 
surface (11) by modifying the separating slot depth and/or cross-section 

of the lamellas. 
Filler body according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the lamellas 
(12) are positioned vertically or at an acute angle to the bearing surface 

(11).  
 
Filler body according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
a cover element (5) is superimposed on the bearing surface (11), including 

the lamellas (12). 
Filler body according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
the lamellas (12) are constructed in an elastic material, which is built up 

from components having different bulk densities and compressive strength. 
Filler body according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
the separating slots (13) are constructed as indentations with a depth of 

2 mm to 15 cm. 
Filler body according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
the cross-section of the lamellas (12) is in the form of a rectangle, square, 

triangle, trapezium, kite, parallelogram or rhombus. 
Filler body according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
polyurethane or polyester foams are used as the elastic material. 
Filler body according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
strengthened and/or preshaped polyester fibre material is used. 
Filler body according to one of the claims 1 to 9, characterized in that 
the lateral faces of the lamellas (12) are bonded together. 
Filler body according to one of the claims 4 to 10, characterized in 
that sliding elements are positioned between the cover element (5) and the 

bearing surface (11) or between the lamellas (12).
