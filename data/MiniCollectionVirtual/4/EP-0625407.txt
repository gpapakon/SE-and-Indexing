<ABSTRACT>
The grinding head (6) is movable relatively to the surface of the workpiece. The grinding head movement is by means of motor drive and at least one sensor detects the edge (15) of the workpiece (11) located in the travel path (14,14') of the grinding head. A control limits the travel path correspondingly to the detected edge (15) and controls the movement of the grinding head. The control after acting on the grinding head moves it on another travel path (14',17') over the workpiece, which is parallel to the first. The grinding head is pivotably fitted on an X-Y travel device around a rotary axis vertical to the workpiece accommodation plane.

Grinding machine having at least one grinding attachment
(6) with a grinding belt (12), which is pressed by

means of a pressure bar (8) onto a workpiece (11, 11')
displaced relative to the grinding attachment (6), the

grinding attachment (6) being designed to travel over
the surface of the workpiece (11, 11'), 
characterised
in that
 at least one sensor (20, 21) detects one edge
(15) of the workpiece (11, 11') located in the

traverse path (14, 14'; 17, 17') of the grinding
attachment (6), that a controller limits the traverse

path (14, 14'; 17, 17') in accordance with the
detected edge (15) and reverses the direction of

movement of the grinding attachment (6), that the
pressure bar (8) consists of a number of pressure shoe

elements (18), which can be individually set to an
operating position, and that the setting of the

pressure shoe elements (18) to the operating position
can be controlled by the at least one sensor (20, 21).
Grinding machine according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 after the direction reversal, the controller
guides the sanding attachment (6) along another

traverse path (14', 17') over the workpiece.
Grinding machine according to Claim 2, 
characterised in
that
 for the direction reversal the grinding attachment
(6) is displaced onto a traverse path (14', 17') which

is parallel to the completed traverse path (14, 17).
Grinding machine according to Claim 3, 
characterised in
that
 after sweeping over the surface of the workpiece
(11, 11') in first parallel traverse paths (14), the

grinding attachment is slewed through 90Â° and is moved
over the surface along second parallel traverse paths

(17) lying perpendicular to the first parallel
traverse paths (14). 
Grinding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the grinding attachment (6) is
swivel-mounted on a swivelling axis (7) on an X-Y

traversing device (3, 4), perpendicular to the feed
plane (10) of the workpiece.
Grinding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 the at least one sensor is
formed by sensor strips (20, 21) arranged parallel to

the pressure bar (8) at the leading or trailing edge
of the grinding attachment (6).
Grinding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that
 the grinding attachment (6) is
mounted in a height-adjustable manner.
Grinding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the grinding attachment (6) is
equipped with at least one proximity sensor.
Grinding machine according to Claims 7 and 8,

characterised in that
 the height adjustment of the
grinding attachment (6) is effected automatically in

relation to the measuring signal of the proximity
sensor.
Grinding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that
 the pressure bar (8) has a
spherical camber which is perpendicular to the

direction of travel of the grinding belt (12).
Grinding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 10,

characterised in that
 the feed plane (10) of the
workpiece is formed by a stationary work table (1). 
Grinding machine according to one of Claims 1 to 11,

characterised by
 the use of capacitive sensors (22) in
at least one sensor strip (20, 21).
