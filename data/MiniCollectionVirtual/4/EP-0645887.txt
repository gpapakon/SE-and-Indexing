<ABSTRACT>
A periodic signal is produced by counting clock pulses over a given period of time. The number of pulses counted is divided by a whole number. Next, batches of pulses of this clock, corresponding in number to the quotient of this division, are counted. With each batch, the value of a periodic signal is produced.

Circuit for producing scanning signals for a 
display monitor equipped with a generator of 

periodic signals of given shape having 

a clock (1) supplying a number A of pulses during 
an interval selected for these periodic signals, A 

being less than or equal to 2
N+M
, N and M being 
integers, 
a first binary digital counter (2) for counting 
the batches of P clock pulses with M counting bits, 

2
M
 being greater than or equal to P, receiving at its 
counting input the pulses from the clock, the P 

clock pulses being produced during fractions 1/(2
N
) 
of the said selected interval, and supplying a batch 

signal each time a batch is counted, 
a second N-bit cyclic binary digital counter (5), 
receiving the said batch signal at its counting 

input and producing an address signal each time a 
batch signal is counted, 
a random access memory (6) with at least 2
N
 
addresses, provided with an address input and a data 

output, connected by its address input to the output 
of the second counter and supplying at its output 

binary signals corresponding to the address signals 
produced, 
and a converter circuit (13) connected to the 
output of the memory in order to produce the said 

periodic signal in accordance with the binary 
signals received, 
  
 

characterised in that 

the production circuit has a circuit for acquiring 
the value of P based on the counting of the number A 

during the selected interval, and in that 
the first counter (2) is programmable by this 
production circuit, with this value of P thus 

acquired. 
Circuit according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the converter circuit (13) has as an input a 

transfer register (15) connected by its input to the 
output of the random access memory, and provided 

with a transfer control input (HSYNC). 
Circuit according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the second counter (5) has a 

reset-to-zero input triggered by a signal (VFback) 
at the selected interval. 
Circuit according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that it has a forcing register (3) 

for forcing the first counter into a given state at 
the start of the counting of the pulses in a batch, 

and a comparison circuit (4) for at any moment 
comparing a state of the counter with a given state. 
Circuit according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the first counter (2) is a downcounter and in 

that the comparison circuit has an OR or NOR gate 
(4) with M inputs. 
Circuit according to one of Claims 4 or 5, 
characterised in that it has a logic circuit (23) 

for connecting differently, in another connection 
mode, the first and the second counter and the  

 
forcing register. 
Circuit according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that, in the other connection mode, 


the second N-bit cyclic binary digital counter (2) 
receives the clock signal (1) at its counting input, 
the first M-bit binary digital counter (2) 
receives at its counting input counting pulses 

coming from the last stage of the second counter 
(5), 
the two counters are connected to the forcing 
register (3), designed to receive and process a 

forcing signal corresponding to the content P of the 
first counter (2) and of part of the second counter, 

the forcing register having a control input 
triggered by a signal (VFback) at the selected 

interval. 
Circuit according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the second counter (5) has a 

reset-to-zero input triggered by a frame 
synchronisation signal (VFback) from the television 

monitor.
