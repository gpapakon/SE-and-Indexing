<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for sealing leaks in water-bearing pipes and vessels, by which it is possible to seal leaks without the danger of disturbing the flow of the aqueous medium through the pipe. This is achieved according to the invention if an aqueous sealing liquid, containing cellulose if desired, based on liquid water glass is used which contains an amount of water glass (sodium silicate) solution which gives a comparatively high pH 
>
/= 10.5 to 
<
/= 11.5 in dilute solution at the boiling point of water and this is processed at elevated temperature in the range 30 - 90 DEG C.

Process for sealing leakages in
building pipelines and vessels, concrete being

excluded as material, by means of aqueous
sealing agents being free of fluoride and

containing, if desired cellulose, and being
based on liquid water-glass, in which process,

before pouring in the sealing liquid, the
vessel and/or pipeline system to be sealed is

emptied, cleaned and/or dried, if required,
characterised in that a sealing liquid is used

consisting of a diluted solution which contains
exclusively a quantity of sodium silicate

solution resulting in an index of pH of ≧ 10.5
up to ≦ 11.5 at water boiling temperature, and,

if desired also cellulose, and that this
solution is used at a temperature in the region

of 30° to 90° C and under a pressure lying in
the region of 0.5 to 2.5 bar or 4 to 8 bar.
Process as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that a sealing liquid is used

consisting of a diluted solution containing a
quantity of sodium silicate solution resulting

in an index of pH between 10.6 and 11.1 at
water boiling temperature.
Process as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that for the sealing of

heating installations, waste water installations
and/or other water system installations

the sealing agent is used with a sodium
silicate quality having a density of 1.365 tc

1.375 kg/cm
3
 at 20° C, 27.2 to 28.2 % SiO
2
 and
8.2 to 8.6 % Na2O, residual water, 35.4 to 36.8

% total solid matter in such a quantity which 
results in 1.5 to 2.5 g solid matter per 100 g

sealing agent.
Process as claimed in claim 3,
characterised in that the sealing liquid is

circulated, in the case of heating installations,
at a pressure of 0.5 to 2.5 bar

through the pipeline system to be sealed.
Process as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that for the sealing of

drinking water pipes a sealing liquid is used
containing sodium silicate in such an amount

resulting in at least 10 % by weight solid
matter and cellulose fibres with an average

fibre strength of 30 to 40 µm, preferably 35µm,
and an average fibre length of 500 to 600 µm in

a quantity of 0.3 to 0.6 % by weight,
preferably 0.5 % by weight, and that the

sealing liquid is circulated through the
pipeline system to be sealed at a temperature

of at least 60°C to 90°C at the most.
Process as claimed in claim 5,
characterised in that the sealing liquid is

circulated through the pipeline system to be
sealed at a pressure of 4 to 8 bar.
Process as claimed in claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that for the sealing of

drinking water installations the sealing agent
is used with a sodium silicate quality with a

density of 1.255 to 1.270 kg/cm
3

to 23.2 % SiO
2
, 5.6 to 6.0 % Na
2
O, residual
water, 27.4 to 29.2 % total solid matter in

such a quantity which results in 13 to 15 g
solid matter per 100 g sealing liquid. 
Process as claimed in claims 1 to
7, characterised in that inhibitors and/or

corrosion preventatives known per se are used
in common in the sealing agent.
Process as claimed in claims 1 to
8, characterised in that as corrosion

inhibitors water-soluble phosphates are used in
common.
Process as claimed in claims 1 to
9, char
acterised in that after the circulation
of the sealing liquid through the pipeline

system to be sealed the latter is rinsed with a
liquid containing an aqueous auxiliary sealing

agent or a hardening agent, respectively.
Process as claimed in claims 5 to
10, characterised in that the sealing liquid is

circulated through the pipeline system to be
sealed over a period of time of at least 24

hours.
Process as claimed in claims 1 to
10, characterised in that for sealing a

fragment of a pipeline, the time of treatment
with the sealing liquid is chosen so as to be

short, preferably 3 to 12 hours, and after
removing the sealing liquid from the fragment

of the pipeline to be sealed the latter is
treated with a liquid containing a quickly

acting hardening agent.
