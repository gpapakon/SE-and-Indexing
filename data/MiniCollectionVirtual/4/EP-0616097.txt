Each support element (1) comprises at least an upper 
plate (3) and a lower plate (4), the lower and upper 

plates being adapted to rest on the upper and lower 
plates respectively of a contiguous element; the 

staircase further includes adjustment and fixing means

the lower plate of each element and for fixing these 
plates together; the upper plate (3) of each element is 

formed with at least one pair of holes (22) and at least 
one pair of female threads (23) is fixed to the plate 

itself, each thread being coaxial with one of the said 
holes; the lower plate (4) of each element is formed with 

a through-hole (29) and a through-slot (30) into which 
are inserted two screw members (31,32), each of which 

also passes through one of the holes (22) in the upper 
plate of the contiguous element and is screwed into the 

corresponding female thread (23) so as to fix these two

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modular support
element adapted to form a support for a corresponding
staircase tread and to be connected to contiguous
elements to form a staircase, as defined in the preamble
of claim 1.Staircases are known which comprise a plurality of
modular support elements each of which has a plurality of
walls of rather complicated shape for forming a support
platform for the respective tread and suitable coupling
seats for the connection of that element to contiguous
ones; such staircases also include a plurality of spacer
members, normally of plate shape, each of which is
adapted to be inserted between two contiguous modular
elements, as well as a plurality of threaded connecting
members which are arranged to interconnect the contiguous
modular elements with the spacer members interposed
between them.The threaded connecting members include at least one bolt
which is adapted to pass through an elongate aperture
formed in one wall of each modular element and a hole
formed in another wall of the contiguous element; this
bolt, which is normally locked by a nut, serves to
connect two contiguous elements together. Modular support elements of the type described and
staircases made therefrom have several disadvantages.First of all, they do not enable the height of the step
riser to be adjusted simply and quickly; indeed this
height is adjusted by the interposition of a spacer
member between two contiguous elements: the operations
which are needed for the interposition of this member and
for locking together the two elements between which the
member has been inserted require particular care and
skill. Moreover, in order to satisfy the need for
staircases to be constructed with different riser
heights, it is necessary to provide a large number of
spacer members of different dimensions. Furthermore the
tread depths of the various steps may be achieved only to
a certain approximation since this depth is determined
simply by the sliding of one modular element
longitudinally relative to the contiguous element, which
movement is allowed by the presence of the aforesaid
aperture in one of the walls of each element.The resistance which each modular element presents to
rotation relative to the contiguous element about a
vertical axis is thus rather poor; indeed, this
resistance depends solely on the frictional torque
generated between these elements and this depends on the
degree to which the bolt which connects the elements is
tightened during assembly and hence the degree to which 
the bolt
