<ABSTRACT>
A torque sensor is provided with a coil whose inductance changes in accordance
with variation in torque acting on an object. The torque is detected on the basis of the

inductance of the coil. Specifically, the torque sensor includes a first oscillation circuit
for detecting the inductance of the coil and for oscillating a signal having a period

corresponding to the detected inductance. The period of the signal generated by the first
oscillation circuit is detected by a period detection section. A torque detection section

detects the torque on the basis of the period detected by the period detection section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a torque sensor for sensing torque acting on an
object, and more particularly to a torque sensor suitable for sensing torque that acts
between an input shaft connected to a steering wheel of a vehicle and an output shaft
connected to a steering mechanism of the vehicle.Conventionally, a torque sensor of the above-described type has been used in a
steering mechanism as shown in FIG 1.First, the structure of the conventional steering mechanism will be described with
reference to FIG 1.A steering mechanism 10 shown in FIG. 1 comprises a hollow shaft 11 connected
to a steering wheel (not shown) of a vehicle. A lower portion of the shaft 11 passes
through and is supported by an upper portion 12a of a housing 12. Another shaft 13 is
inserted into a lower portion 12b of the housing 12. A pinion 14 is provided on a lower
portion of the shaft 13, and the pinion 14 is in meshing-engagement with a rack R. An
unillustrated motor is provided and drivingly connected to the rack R in order to assist the
driver's steering operation.A torsion bar 15 is accommodated inside the shaft 11. The upper end of the
torsion bar 15 is connected to the shaft 11 by means of a pin 16, and the lower end of the
torsion bar 15 is in spline-engagement with the shaft 13.Therefore, when a torque is applied to the shaft 11 upon operation of the steering
wheel, the torsion bar 15 is twisted, so that a relative displacement is produced between the
shaft 11 and the shaft 13. Within the housing 12, a sensor ring 17 formed of a magnetic material is provided
on the shaft 11, and a sensor ring 18 formed of a magnetic material is provided on the shaft
13. Further, a torque sensing coil 19 is provided inside the housing 12 such that the
torque sensing coil 19 surrounds the sensor rings 17 and 18 with a predetermined gap
formed therebetween. When a relative displacement is produced between the shafts 11
and 13, the amount of overlap between the sensor rings 17 and 18 changes, resulting in a
change in the inductance of the torque sensing coil 19. Thus, a signal corresponding to
the sensed torque is obtained from the torque sensing coil 19. The torque sensing coil 19
is connected to an interface circuit (hereinafter referred to as an "I/F circuit") 80 disposed
at the right end of the housing 12 in FIG. 1. The I/F circuit 80 is connected to a
microcomputer (not shown) provided in the vehicle.Next, operation of the I/F circuit 80 will be described with reference to FIG. 2.DC current supplied from a DC power source 81 is
