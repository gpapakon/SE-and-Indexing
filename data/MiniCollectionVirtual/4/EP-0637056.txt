<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to high-pressure discharge lamps having a halogen-containing filling used for producing light or radiation. In order to avoid the electrode corrosion which occurs in this type of lamp and takes place with the partition of oxygen and is caused by a chemical reaction of the electrode material with the halogen in the filling, a getter which binds the free residual oxygen is introduced into the discharge vessel. Suitable getter substances are the elements phosphorus, boron, aluminium, scandium and the rare earth metals and the halides, preferably iodides, thereof and the tungsten/boron compounds WB and W2B and the tin/phosphorus compounds SnP, SnP3, Sn4P3.
