<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE EXTRACTION OF SOLID, GRANULAR AND/OR CRUSHED MATERIALS WITH A LIQUID AND FOR PRETREATMENT THEREOF TO FURTHER EXTRACTIONThis invention relates to a process for extracting solid, granular and/or crushed materials with a liquid, for a pretreat ent thereof to further extraction as well as an equipment for carrying out this process.It is known that a previous mechanical and chemical decomposition of a solid is the precondition for obtaining an active agent from the solid (extraction). ("De¬ composition" means either chemical or me¬ chanical destruction or both in this descrip¬ tion.) The mechanical decomposition of a solid - e.g. a plant - is substantially car¬ ried out by crushing and grinding, where the walls of plant cells are loosened and the cutting up to small pieces of the solid occurs. Chemical decomposition is usually achieved by using a chemical containing one or more components and results in the dis¬ solution of the valuable substance (active agent) being present in the solid, chiefly in the cells.The crushing (mechanical decomposition) is carried out by using various grinding apparatus (e.g. hammer mill, roll train and the like). The removal of substances (extrac¬ tion) can most favourably be effectuated from a material ground to a powder since the decomposition of cell walls occurs to the highest grade in this case. However, 

 the extent of grinding is limited thereby that the flow of liquid through the ground solid aggregate being in powder form proceeds only with holdback and can even be stopped in extreme cases. From this point of view, the continuously working (operating) counter- current solid/liquid extractors are particu¬ larly sensitive therefore, the optimization of the grade (extent) of grinding is necessary. It should be noted that the operation of grinding is usually not directly connected to the extractor; the grinding apparatus is located farther, eventually in a separate space.An efficient chemical decomposition, i.e. dissolution of the valuable substance (active agent) substantially requires the getting of the decomposing (extracting) liquid to each solid particle and a sufficient residence time thereof together with the solid particle. In the Hungarian patent specification No. 148,662 an apparatus for decomposition of a solid to be extracted is described, to which a ground solid is fed in, to which a liquid possessing a pH value (acidic, alkaline or neutral) and chemical properties (composition) suitable to the extraction task given is added and
