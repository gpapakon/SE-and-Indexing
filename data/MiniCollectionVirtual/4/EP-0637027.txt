<ABSTRACT>
A method for detecting scene cuts in a motion picture, 
which comprises a plurality of frames in a sequential 

order. The preferred embodiment of the present 
invention utilizes the correlation between successive 

frames to detect abrupt cuts. Gradual cuts are 
preferably detected by examining a function consisting 

of the standard deviation of the pixels of each frame as 
a function of the frame number.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to video processing 
and more particularly, to an improved method for 
automatically detecting the start of a new scene in a 
video sequence. A typical motion picture consists of a sequence of scenes. Within a scene, 
each frame differs only slightly from the preceding frame. The change from one 
scene to the next will be referred to as "cut" in the following discussion. Scene cuts 
may be abrupt or gradual. Gradual scene cuts are associated with special effects such 
as camera pans, dissolves, fades to black or fade from black. One method for summarizing a motion picture is to provide a log of the 
scenes. A scene log is a list of the scenes and the location of the start of the scene 
from some reference point such as the start of the motion picture. A typical 
frame from the scene may be used to summarize the scene. Among other things, such logs are useful in video editing. The log provides 
a means for an editor to quickly find a particular scene. Prior art schemes for automating the logging of motion pictures rely on the 
difference between sequential frames to determine where a cut has occurred. These 
methods compute the average value of some parameter such as the absolute value of 
the difference of corresponding pixels in two sequential frames. Such methods do not 
detect gradual cuts with sufficient reliability to be useful in automating the cut 
logging process. In addition, there are some situations in which even abrupt 
cuts are not detected by these methods. Broadly, it is the object of the present invention to provide an improved 
method for detecting scene cuts.  It is a further object of the present invention to provide 
an automated method for detecting both gradual scene and 
abrupt cuts. Accordingly, the invention proposes a method for detecting 
scene cuts in a motion picture, said motion picture comprising 
an ordered sequence of frames, each said frame comprising a 
plurality of intensity values, said method comprising the 
steps of determining a correlation value of each frame with a 
corresponding previous frame, said previous frame being 
separated in said sequence by a predetermined number of 
frames; comparing said correlation value with a threshold 
value; and reporting an abrupt scene change if said 
correlation value is less than said threshold value. The preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes 
the correlation between successive frames to detect abrupt 
cuts. Gradual cuts are preferably detected by examining a 
function

ical 
measure less than the difference in said statistical measure between the 

beginning and end of said ramp.
