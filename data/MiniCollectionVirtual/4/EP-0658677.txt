<ABSTRACT>
A fire-resistant glazing for avoiding the through-passage of fire and smoke, in the event of a fire, from one room into another utilizes fire-protection panes (1, 2) with a protective agent which is contained therein, expands, in the event of a fire, with a cooling action and thereby emerges partially out of the end surfaces of the fire-protection panes (1, 2). The fire-protection panes (1, 2) are retained laterally by a supporting structure which does not itself have any protective measures against fire and heat. In order to avoid warping and thus pronounced curvature of the fire-protectiong glazing in the event of a fire, the supporting structure is made up of at least one preferably vertically arranged support (4) which is arranged in a free-standing manner in the room, at a distance from the fire-protection means (1, 2), and is fastened by its two ends on the respective room-binding surfaces (5, 6). The support (4) is exclusively connected via connecting arms to the respectively adjacent fire-protection panes (1, 2) and retains the latter.

<CLAIMS>
Fire-resistant glazing to avoid the passage of 
fire and smoke in the event of a fire from one room to 

another using fire-resistant panes of glass, having a 
protective substance contained therein which foams in the 

event of a fire, with a cooling effect, and, in the 
process, partially emerges from the end faces of the 

fire-resistant panes of glass, and having a support 
structure which holds the fire-resistant pane of glass at 

the side and does not itself have any protective measures 
against fire and heat, characterized in that the support 

structure is composed of at least one preferably 
vertically arranged support (4) which is arranged in a 

free-standing manner in the room at a distance from the 
fire-resistant panes of glass (1, 2) and, in this 

position, is attached by its two ends to the respective 
surfaces (5, 6) bounding the room and which is connected 

solely by means of connecting arms (7) to the respective 
adjacent fire-resistant panes of glass (1, 2), holding 

the latter. 
Fire-resistant glazing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that means (10) are provided to compensate 

thermally caused changes in position between the 
support (4) on the one hand and the fire-resistant panes 

of glass (1, 2) on the other hand. 
Fire-resistant glazing according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that the compensating means consist of 

axial displaceability of the connecting arms (7) along 
the support (4). 
Fire-resistant glazing according to Claim 2 or 
Claim 3, characterized by a blocking element (11), which  

 
only releases the compensating means (10) under the 

effect of heat. 
Fire-resistant glazing according to Claim 4, 
characterized by a melting element as blocking element 

(11) or to release the blocking element (11). 
Fire-resistant glazing according to Claim 4, 
characterized by an intended rupture element as blocking 

element (11) or to release the blocking element (11). 
Fire-resistant glazing according to one of Claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that the support (4) is provided 

with length compensation (12), preferably in the region 
of its upper attachment. 
Fire-resistant glazing according to one of Claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that the support (4) is located 

solely on one side of the fire-resistant glazing, whereas 
the other side of the fire-resistant glazing is free from 

support structures. 
Fire-resistant glazing according to one of Claims 
1 to 8, characterized in that support plates (8a) are 

attached to the connecting arms (7), against which 
support plates the fire-resistant panes of glass (1, 2) 

rest flat in their edge regions. 
Fire-resistant glazing according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the edge regions of the fire-resistant 

panes of glass (1, 2) are clamped between 
support plates (8a, 8b) connected to one another in 

pairs.
