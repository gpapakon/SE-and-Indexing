<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic polyurethane composition comprising a thermoplastic polyurethane and a tin compound in 
an amount of 0.3-15 ppm (in terms of tin atom) based on the polyurethane. The composition has a retention of the 

long-chain hard segment of the polyurethane of 85 % or above when melt treated at 220 °C for 60 minutes. Further 
it has a retention of the logarithmic viscosity of 85 % or above when melt treated at 220 °C for 6 minutes, melt 

extruded and left to stand at 20 °C and 60 % R.H. for 24 hours. The composition is so excellent in moldability that it 
can provide moldings excellent in various properties such as tenacity and elongation, thermal resistance, compression 

set and hydrolysis resistance, thus being useful as the material of various moldings. Further it is so excellent in 
spinnability that it can provide fibers excellent in various properties such as thermal resistance, hydrolysis resistance 

and unwindability, thus being useful also as the material of elastic fibers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermoplastic polyurethane
compositions having excellent moldability and being
capable of minimizing the decrease of the molecular weight
of molded articles therefrom, which decrease would otherwise
deteriorate their properties, whereby the molded articles
have excellent properties such as tensile strength and
elongation, compression set, heat resistance and resistance
to hydrolysis, and to a process for producing the same. The
present invention further relates to an ester-based polymer diol composition
to be used for the above thermoplastic polyurethane
compositions and to a process for producing the same. The
present invention still further relates to molded articles
and elastic fibers obtained from the above thermoplastic
polyurethane compositions and processes for producing the
same.Upon manufacture of thermoplastic polyurethanes,
various polymer diols are used as the raw material for
constituting their soft segments and these diols include
polyester diols, polyesterpolycarbonate diols, polycarbonate
diols and polyether diols. Among these diols, polyester
diols are most widely used, since they give thermoplastic
polyurethanes having excellent mechanical properties. Ester-based polymer diols, such as polyester diols,
polycarbonate diols and polyesterpolycarbonate diols are
generally produced by polycondensing a dicarboxylic acid or
its ester-forming derivatives such as esters or anhydrides
thereof and a short-chain diol by direct esterification or
transesterification, or by subjecting a lactone to ring-opening
polymerization. Titanium-based compounds, having
high catalytic activity, are widely used as catalysts
(esterification catalyst) for these esterifications,
including direct esterification, transesterification and
ring-opening polymerization, to produce these ester-based
polymer diols.Thermoplastic polyurethanes are obtained by subjecting
to urethanization one of the above polymer diols, together
with an organic diisocyanate such as 4,4'-diphenylmethane
diisocyanate or naphthalene diisocyanate and a chain
extender of a short-chain diol such as 1,4-butanediol.However, thermoplastic polyurethanes obtained by
conducting melt polymerization using an ester-based polymer
diol having been obtained with a titanium compound catalyst,
while the activity of the catalyst was not permitted to
decrease after the polymer preparation, have insufficient
uniformity in their properties, such as heat resistance and
resistance to hydrolysis. Molded articles obtained by melt
molding,
