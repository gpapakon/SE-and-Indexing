<ABSTRACT>
Furniture connection fittings usually contain a fitting element which is to be connected to one furniture part and contains an eccentrically mounted, rotatable element. The latter acts on the head (1) of a clamping bolt, which is attached on the respectively other furniture part. In order to compensate for tolerances, the invention proposes a clamping bolt in the case of which the bolt head (1) is attached on the other furniture part such that it yields by a certain amount.

Clamping bolt for a furniture joining fitting, particularly a system connector, 
with 


1.1 a fixing element (3) for fixing the clamping bolt to one furniture part 
to be joined, 
1.2 a bolt head (1), which 

1.2.1 is located on the side of the fixing element (3) facing the 
other furniture part and 
1.2.2 is separated from the latter by a portion (6), which 
1.2.3 has in at least one direction a transverse dimension reduced 
compared with the bolt head, in which 
1.3 in the tensioning direction of the joining fitting the bolt head (1) 
is resiliently held on the fixing element. 
Clamping bolt according to claim 2, in which the fixing element (3) has a 
portion provided with an external thread (4) for screwing into a bore in the 

furniture part. 
Clamping bolt according to claim 1 or 2, in which the fixing element (3) 
has a sleeve (5, 14) or is constructed as a sleeve (5, 14). 
Clamping bolt according to one of the preceding claims with a shank (9), 
on whose end is formed the bolt head (1). 
Clamping bolt according to claim 4, in which the shank (9) traverses the 
sleeve (5, 14). 
Clamping bolt according to claim 4 or 5, in which between a stop formed on 
the shank (9) and the fixing element (3) a spring is located, in particular in 

the form of a compression spring. 
Clamping bolt according to claim 6, in which the stop is formed by a rivet 
head (11) at the end of the shank (9). 
Clamping bolt according to one of the preceding claims, in which the  
 

fixing element (3) is made from resilient material. 
Clamping bolt according to one of the preceding claims, in which the bolt 
head (1) is fitted in such a way that the resilience is brought about by 

compressive loading. 
Clamping bolt according to one of the preceding claims, in which the bolt 
head (1) is connected in non-rotary manner to the fixing element (3). 
Clamping bolt according to one of the preceding claims, in which the bolt 
head (1) has a drive construction (8) in its end face (7) remote from the 

fixing element (3). 
Clamping bolt according to one of the preceding claims, in which the 
resilience is positioned by material selection and/or placing the material at 

the end of the fixing element (3) opposite to the bolt head (1). 
Clamping bolt according to one of the preceding claims, which is substantially 
rotationally symmetrical to the longitudinal axis. 
Clamping bolt according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
resilience is such that no resilience occurs in the case of a tensile force 

necessary for joining the two furniture parts.
