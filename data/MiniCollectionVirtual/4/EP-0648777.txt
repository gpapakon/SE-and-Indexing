<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to fluorinated 
surfaces which exhibit sufficient hydrophilicity and 

sufficient electropositivity to bind DNA from a 
suspension containing DNA and permit elution of the DNA 

from the surface. Generally, the hydrophilic and 
electropositive characteristics are expressed at the 

fluorinated surface. Preferred fluorinated surfaces of 
the present invention include fluorinated Al(OH)₃, 

fluorinated SiO₂ and fluorinated Celite. The fluorinated 
surfaces of the present invention are particularly 

useful in processes for purification of DNA from other 
cellular components. In these processes, a suspension 

of cellular components is placed in contact with the 
fluorinated surface, the fluorinated surface is washed 

to remove all cellular components other than DNA which 
are bound to the surface, and the bound DNA is eluted 

from the surface. Lower concentrations of chaotrope in 
the binding buffer are needed to bind DNA to the 

fluorinated surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
purification of DNA by solid phase extraction, and more
specifically to fluorinated surfaces which are capable
of binding DNA and eluting DNA under suitable
conditions.The preparation of high-purity double-stranded (ds)
plasmid DNA, single-stranded (ss) phage DNA, chromosomal
DNA and agarose gel-purified DNA fragments is of
critical importance in molecular biology. Ideally, a
method for purifying DNA should be simple, rapid and
require little, if any, additional sample manipulation.
DNA rendered by such a method should be immediately
amenable to transformation, restriction analysis,
ligation or sequencing. A method with all of these
features would be extremely attractive in the automation
of DNA sample preparation, a goal of research and
diagnostic laboratories. Typically, the preparation of
plasmid DNA from crude alcohol precipitates is
laborious, most often utilizing CsCl gradients, gel
filtration, ion exchange chromatography, or RNase,
proteinase K and repeated alcohol precipitation steps.
These methods also require considerable downstream
sample preparation to remove CsCl and other salts,
ethidium bromide and alcohol. Similar arguments extend
when using any of these methods for purifying DNA
fragments. A further problem with these methods is that
small, negatively-charged cellular components can co-purify
with the DNA. Thus, the DNA can have an
undesirable level of contamination.DNA can also be purified using solid phases.
Conventional solid phase extraction techniques have 
utilized surfaces which either (1) fail to attract and
hold sufficient quantities of DNA molecules because of
surface design to permit easy recovery of the DNA
molecules during elution, or (2) excessively adhere DNA
molecules to the surface, thereby hindering recovery of
the DNA molecules during elution. Conventional metal
surfaces which cause these problems when utilized in
solid phase extraction include silica surfaces such as
glass and Celite. Adequate binding of DNA to these
types of surfaces can be achieved only by utilizing high
concentrations of chaotropes or alcohols which are
generally toxic, caustic, and/or expensive. For
example, it is known that DNA will bind to crushed glass
powders and to glass fiber filters in the presence of
chaotropes. The chaotropic ions typically are washed
away with alcohol, and the DNAs are eluted with low-salt
solutions or water. Importantly, RNA and protein do not
bind. However, a serious drawback in the use of crushed
glass powder is that its
