Apparatus for the automatic exact metering of small
amounts of liquid in a medical analysis system,

comprising

a phase boundary detection means (2) by means of
which a fluid phase boundary (10) in a transparent

measuring tube (9) with a capillary with an inner
bore of less than 1 mm, preferably less than 0.5 mm,

is automatically detected and an electrical position
signal corresponding to the position of the phase

boundary (10) in a detection section (8) of the
measuring tube (9) is generated,
with an illumination device (15) with at least one
light source (12) for the illumination of the measuring

tube (9), a light reception means (17) with at
least one light detector which detects light passing

through the measuring tube (9) and converts it into
an electrical signal dependent on the spatial distribution

of the light received by the light detector
and a data processing means (7) for processing the

signals from the light detector (17) into information
on the position of the fluid phase boundary (10) in

the measuring tube (9),
wherein the illumination device (15) is designed for
the spatially steady illumination of a detection

section (8) of the measuring tube (9) and
the light reception device (17) comprises an optical

claims, in which the auxiliary fluid is a gas, in

particular air, the measuring tube (9) is a rising
tube (11) for the liquid and the phase boundary (10)

is a liquid level which separates a liquid column in
the rising tube (11) from a gas space (11b) located

above the liquid column, the gas being supplied to
the gas space (11b) or discharged from the latter in

order to eject or aspirate precisely defined amounts
