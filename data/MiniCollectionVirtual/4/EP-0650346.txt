<ABSTRACT>
A device for the orthopedic treatment of jaw fractures or tooth displacements has ring-shaped dental bands (10) which surround the teeth and are detachably secured to at least two teeth of a jaw. In order to attach the dental band (10) to the tooth in a secure and detachable manner, at least two tensioning blocks (11, 12) are integrally shaped on the dental band. The tensioning blocks are arranged in pairs at a distance from each other, aligned bores and/or threaded holes are created in both tensioning blocks and the gap (a) may be reduced by means of at least one tensioning screw (20) held in the bores or threaded holes.
