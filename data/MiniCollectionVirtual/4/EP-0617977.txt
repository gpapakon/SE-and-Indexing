<ABSTRACT>
A flexible, kink-resistant, introducer sheath for percutaneous vascular 
access. The introducer sheath includes a flat wire coil with uniform spacing between 

the turns, which is compression fitted about an inner, lubricous material 
polytetrafluoroethylene tube. The introducer sheath further includes an outer tube of 

a heat formable polyamide material which is heat formed and compressed through 
the spaces between the turns of the wire coil to mechanically connect to the 

roughened outer surface of the inner tube. The distal end of the outer tube is tapered 
in a mold with additional polyamide outer tube material. The proximal end of the 

sheath is flared for connection to a connector fitting. In the preferred embodiment 
shown in Fig. 8, the flat wire coil has an inner diameter less than the outer diameter 

of the inner tube, and the coil is expanded as it is unwound from the coil and 
wrapped around the inner tube to form a compression fit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to introducer sheaths.Introducer sheaths are well-known for percutaneous vascular access ad
typically comprise polytetrafluoroethylene or fluorinated ethylene propylene. These
sheaths are of a thin-wall construction, but tend to kink. Increasing the thickness of
the sheath wall minimally improves the level of kink resistance, which is still
unacceptable. Sheaths used in hemofiltration ad dialysis, in particular, are prone to
kinking since they remain positioned in a patient's body for a long time. While
positioned in a patient, the sheath may be bent or pinched off and, as a result, lank
due to repeated use or patient movement. A kinked sheath is unusable and cannot be
straightened while positioned in the body of a patient. Consequently, the sheath
must be removed, leaving a enlarged, bleeding opening, which typically cannot be
reused. Vascular access is then attempted at an alternative site, and the procedure is
restarted. Restarting the procedure causes a time delay, which may be life
threatening. In some cases, an alternative site is not available for introducing
another sheath.Another problem with thin-wall sheaths is that an emergency room
physician will typically kink an introducer sheath while inserting various catheters
therethrough during emergency procedures. Small diameter introducer sheaths are
also typically bent and kinked under the time constraints of a emergency situation.
As a result, a new sheath must be introduced at the same or another access site.Examples of introducer sheaths are described in U.S. Patent Nos.
4,634,432; 4,657,772; 4,705,511, and U.S. Application No. 07/741,689 filed 7th
August 1991. These sheaths tend to have walls about twice as thick as those of
PTFE sheaths for the same internal diameters.According to the present invention, there is provided a method
as defined in claim 1.The winding of the compression fitted coil on to the inner tube
reinforces the wall to provide an extremely kink-resistant and thin-walled introducer
sheath. A predetermined uniform spacing between the coils is achieved, and the
inner surface of the inner tube is surprisingly smooth with obvious advantages.
Extremely wide spacing weakens the wall and creates a rough inner surface. Narrow
spacing does not allow sufficient room for connecting the outer tube to the inner
tube. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the turns of a coil
having an inner diameter smaller than the outer diameter of the inner tube are
unwound therefrom and are wound and compression
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a flexible kink-resistant introducer sheath
(40), said method comprising providing an inner tube (42) having an outer diameter

and a passageway (41) extending longitudinally therethrough; compression fitting a
coil (43) having a plurality of turns with an inner diameter less than the outer

diameter of the inner tube on the outer surface of the inner tube, positioning an outer
tube (44) around the coil and the inner tube, and connecting the outer tube to the

inner tube through spaces between said turns, wherein the coil is compression fitted
on to the inner tube whilst the latter is maintained in an uncollapsed state by

sequentially wrapping the turns of the coil around the outer surface of the inner tube,
said turns being in a pre-stressed condition.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the turns are wrapped around
the inner tube whilst the latter is rotated, and wherein the turns are expanded when

they are wrapped around the inner tube.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the step of connecting
the outer tube to the inner tube includes positioning a heat shrink tube around the

outer tube and heating the heat shrink tube to compress the outer tube through the
spaces between said turns.
A method according to claim 1,2 or 3, wherein a mandril is inserted in
the said passageway (41) of the inner tube prior to compression fitting the turns of

the coil on to the said outer surface of the inner tube.
A method according to claim 4, wherein the turns are provided from a
coil transfer mechanism (59) mounted on a carriage (60) of a lathe
, and wherein the
mandril and the inner tube are rotated whilst the expanded coil is being wrapped and

compression fitted on the outer surface of the inner tube.
A method according to claim 5, wherein afier a desired length of coil
has been wrapped around the inner tube, the mandril, the inner tube and the wrapped

wire coil are removed from the lathe and a radiopaque marker is positioned adjacent
to the distal end of the coil and is covered by the outer tube.
