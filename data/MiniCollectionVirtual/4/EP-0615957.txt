<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to dehydration 
of micro particular sludge waste discharged from industrial 
plants, such as a water treatment plant, a paper mill, a food 
manufactory and a chemical plant, and more particularly to a 
compact sludge dehydrating device which can be changed in a 
part of its elements, particularly its upper part, in line 
with kinds of the wastes to be treated and, as a result, has 
a good compatibility, and remarkably reduces the moisture 
content of the resulting sludge waste. There have been proposed several types of sludge waste 
dehydrating devices, such as a roller belt type device, a 
heating type device, a conventional compressing type device 
including a screw compressing type device. However, each of 
these known devices has a complex construction and a 
relatively larger scale so that its operation requires much 
energy, resulting in economical problem. Furthermore, these 
known devices cause capillarity of the resulting sludge waste 
since the sludge wastes before and after the compression  
 
dehydration are continuously fed in rapid succession. Such a 
capillarity causes the compressed and dehydrated sludge waste 
to absorb the moisture of the waste before the dehydration and 
this reduces the dehydration efficiency. In this regard, such known dehydrating devices have a 
problem in that they can not easily economically dehydrate the 
sludge waste. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to 
provide a device for dehydrating sludge waste in which the 
aforementioned problem can be overcome and which causes no 
capillarity of the sludge under the compression, thereby 
reducing the moisture content of the resulting sludge waste to 
an extent of about 40 % without using additional heat drying 
means, and which has a relatively simple construction and 
compact size as well as excellent dehydrating efficiency and 
minimizes operational energy consumption, and provides a good 
compatibility as a result of easy change of a part of its 
elements, particularly its upper part, in line with kinds of 
sludge wastes to be treated. In accordance with an embodiment of the present 
invention, the aforementioned object can be overcome by 
providing a device for dehydrating sludge waste comprising: a  
 
lower part; a replaceable upper part having a sludge inlet, 
said upper part being detachably mounted on the lower part to 
be spaced apart from the lower part by a predetermined height; 
a plurality of columns for detachably mounting the upper part 
on the
