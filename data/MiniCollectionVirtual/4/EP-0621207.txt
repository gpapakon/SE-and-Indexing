<ABSTRACT>
Profile (1) intended especially to be applied on at least two contiguous faces (2, 3) of objects (4) to be kept spaced apart and to be protected from shocks (impacts) when they are being handled, stored and transported, and made of an elastic material known for absorbing shocks, in particular a material in the form of a foam, the said profile being covered, in at least one inner region (6) of the profile located opposite the junction (5) of the two aforementioned contiguous faces (2, 3), with a layer (7) of material having resistance to puncture and/or shear and/or to tearing and/or to abrasion, which is greater than the resistance provided by the abovementioned elastic material and process for the manufacture of this profile.

Profiled section (1) designed in particular to be
applied to at least two contiguous faces (2, 3) of objects

(4) to keep them spaced from each other and to protect
against impacts as they are handled, stored and

transported, and made of an elastic material known to
absorb impacts, such as a material in the form of a foam,

in particular a plastic material, characterized in that the
said profiled section is covered, at least in its inner

zone (6) intended to come into contact with the two
aforementioned contiguous faces (2, 3) situated either side

of the connection (5) between these, with a layer of
material (7) having resistance to piercing and/or to shear

and/or to tearing and/or to abrasion which is greater than
the resistance of the aforementioned elastic material.
Profiled section according to claim 1, characterized in
that the abovementioned layer of material (7) covers the

aforementioned internal zone (6) along the longitudinal
axis of the profiled section.
Profiled section according to claim 1, characterized in
that the abovementioned layer of material (7) covers the

aforementioned internal zone (6) transversely to the
longitudinal axis of the profiled section.
Profiled section according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the flexibility of the abovementioned

layer of material (7) is such that the flexibility of the
profiled section is close to that of the aforementioned

elastic material.
Profiled section according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the aforementioned layer of material

(7) is attached to the elastic material constituting the
profiled section. 
Profiled section according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the abovementioned layer of material

(7) is continuous.
Profiled section according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the aforementioned layer of material

is discontinuous.
Profiled section according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the elastic material and the

aforementioned layer of material are chosen from the family
of polyolefins and copolymers thereof.
Profiled section according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the profiled section (1), intended to

protect the edge (10) of thin objects (4) and more
particularly windscreens, windows and rear windows of motor

vehicles, has a U-shaped cross section taken perpendicular
to the longitudinal axis of the profiled section, the edge

(10) of the object inserted into the profiled section
resting on the inner face (11) of the core (12) of the said

U, while the inner faces (13) of the arms (14) of the
latter rest on the opposite faces (15) of the said object

(4), the inner faces (13) of the arms of the U being
connected to the inner face (11) of the core (12) of the U

by a substantially cylindrical surface (15') of which the
diameter is at least equal to the distance separating the

inner faces (13) of the abovementioned arms (14), the
aforementioned layer of material (7) being disposed on

this cylindrical surface in a symmetrical manner with
respect to the plane passing through the axis of this

surface and parallel to the arms (14) of the U and so as to
be able to cooperate simultaneously with the edge (10) and

the faces (15) of the object (4).
Profiled section according to claim 9, characterized in
that the cross section of the abovementioned material (7), 

taken perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the
profiled section, is crescent-shaped, arranged so that its

ends are in contact with the opposite faces (15) of the
object to be protected.
Profiled section according to one or other of claims 9
and 10, characterized in that it has, in the two arms (14)

of the U, notches (27) made transversely to the
longitudinal axis of the profiled section, regularly spaced

and situated facing each other, the depth of the said
notches (27) being substantially equal to the height of the

inner faces (13) of the arms (14) of the U.
Process for manufacturing the profiled section
according to one or other of claims 9 and 10, characterized

in that it consists of continuously extruding (in 28) a
profiled section (1) having a rectangular cross section

while delimiting therein a cylindrical recess (15') with an
axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the profiled

section, of cooling (in 29) and in drying (in 30) the
extruded profiled section, of notching the latter

continuously (in 31), starting from one of its outer faces
and parallel to the contiguous faces of this face, as far

as the aforementioned recess so as to form the
aforementioned U, and of introducing into the recess

produced an extrusion head (33) which deposits the layer
(7) of the aforementioned material, either continuously, or

in sections disposed at regular intervals and a short
distance from each other.
Process according to claim 12, characterized in that,
after extruding the abovementioned layer of material (7),

the arms (14) of the abovementioned U are welded together
by their inner faces.
Process according to one or other of claims 12 and 13,

produced after the deposition and solidification of the
aforementioned layer of material (7).
