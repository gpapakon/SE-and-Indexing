<ABSTRACT>
Herein disclosed are a toy top spinner, which uses a toy top 
body as a spinning wheel and can accelerate the spinning speed of 

the spinning wheel easily, and an adapter which is used with the 
spinner and can spin toy tops having slightly different diameters. 

The spinner has its body equipped with braking means in addition to 
the spinning wheel. The rotor is formed with hook means. Between 

the spinning wheel and the rotor, there is interposed a gear train 
which in equipped with an idle gear. The braking means includes a 

braking member and a braked member mounted on the axle of the 
rotor. The adapter device can be removably mounted on the rotor 

and has its body formed with a hook member inside of the hook means 
of the rotor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spinner for spinning a toy
top.A toy top known from the prior art
document GB-A-2 212 070
includes a driver provided
with a spring which is wound to accumulate force which is imparted
to the toy top to cause the top to spin. Such toy top spinner has
not been found to be sufficiently satisfactory because the
mechanism for winding the spring is undesirably complicated and it
experiences so much mechanical loss in imparting spinning action to
the toy top that it cannot impart the desired number of revolutions
to the top for the desired spinning action. GB-A 1 544 762 teaches a helicopter toy comprising a launcher including a rotor
having an axle. The launcher further comprises means provided on the rotor for
removably engaging the helicopter to rotate it in a predetermined direction of
rotation. A gear train is interposed between a spinning means and the axle for
transmitting the rotation of the spinning means to the rotor and thereby to the
helicopter. Since the spinning means is mechanically coupled to the rotor all the time
again a mechanical loss in imparting spinning action to the helicopter occurs, unless
the latter is released at a certain time. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a spinner
providing a greater number of revolutions to a toy top.It is the object of the present invention to satisfy the
foregoing needs in the art.The spinner embodying the present invention
as claimed in claims 1 and 3
and satisfying the
foregoing needs includes a rotor to 
which a toy top is removably mountable. The spinner includes a
spinning wheel which upon being rotated imparts rotation to the
rotor, and thereby to the toy top, through an intermediate gear
train
preferably
including a pinion and an idle gear mounted movably in a
slot. The pinion is connected to the rotor and the idle gear is
connected to the spinning wheel. Upon the rotor and toy top
spinning at a higher rate than the spinning wheel, the pinion
repels the idle gear which moves along the slot away from and out
of engagement with the pinion whereupon the spinning wheel and idle
gear impart no braking action to the rotor and thereby to the toy
top after which the toy top accumulates rotating energy and acts as
the spinning wheel for the rotor. Upon the spinner and toy top
being inverted and a braking member provided on the spinner
operated, rotation of the rotor is stopped and the toy top is
released from the rotor, falls to a playing surface and spins until
the rotational energy accumulated in the toy top
