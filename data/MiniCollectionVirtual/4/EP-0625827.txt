<ABSTRACT>
A digital-to-analog converter (18) having a ladder resistor portion (20) for 
generating a plurality of quantization signals of predetermined values based on reference 

signals of predetermined values based on reference signals (V
DD
, V
SS
) and a 
quantization switch portion (22) for selectively outputting one of the quantization signals 

in accordance with a digital input value (Y) is provided. The ladder resistor portion is 
coupled to at lest one resistor (R2, R3) for generating a signal whose value corresponds 

to a desired signal level of a signal to be added (SYNC). A switch means (23) is further 
provided for supplying the signal of the value corresponding to the desired signal level 

to an output of the switch portion (22) in response to a timing signal synchronized with 
the signal to be added.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter suitable for use in
such a case that a video signal digitally processed in a video camera or the like is converted
into an analog signal.In particular this invention relates to a digital-to-analog converter.A digital-to-analog converter is known in the art.For example is a digital-to-analog convener known from JP-A-0137123. Herein
a digital-to-analog converter device is described with additional circuitry for inputting a
synchronizing signal and outputting a signal which has a level lower than the analog area
occupied by a luminance signal output from said converter.In accordance with the recent expansion of the application field of the digital
signal processing IC's, a significant progress has been achieved in the digital processing of
video signals in consumer-use portable apparatuses such as portable video cameras (or
camcorders). The video signal digitally processed in such a camcorder is generally converted
into an analog video signal by a D/A convener in order to obtain a standard analog recording
signal.A luminance signal, for example, of the video signal in such a digital signal
processing IC as described above is usually represented in eight bits and is converted into an
analog signal by means of a D/A converter incorporated in the IC. The analog luminance
signal thus obtained and outputted from the IC is combined with a synchronization signal by
the aid of other circuit components and is thereafter supplied, for example, to a frequency
converter.It will be very unpreferable for the miniaturization of a camcorder or the like to
provide separate circuit components in addition to the digital processing IC only for the
purpose of adding a synchronization signal as described above. On the other hand, for the
incorporation of a synchronization-signal addition circuit into a digital video signal processing
IC a special measure has to be taken to overcome the restrictions of space in the IC. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a D/A converter
which can add, when convening a digital signal such as a luminance signal of a digital video
signal into an analog signal, a further signal to the analog signal with a minimum circuit
structure.To achieve the above object, a digital-to-analog converter provided in
accordance with the present invention comprises the features as claimed in claim 1.With the above structure, only the resistor to be coupled to the ladder resistor
portion and the switch means for supplying a voltage
