<DESCRIPTION>
 CHEMICAL COMPOUNDSThe present invention relates to new compounds which are angiotensin II receptor antagonists and are useful in regulating hypertension induced or exacerbated by angiotensin II, and in the treatment of congestive heart failure, renal failure, and glaucoma. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and methods for using these compounds as antagonists of angiotensin II, as antihypertensive agents and as agents for treating congestive heart failure, renal failure, and glaucoma.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe class of peptide pressor hormone known as angiotensin is responsible for a vasopressor action that is implicated in the etiology of hypertension in man.Inappropriate activity of the renin-angiotensin systems appears to be a key element in essential hypertension, congestive heart failure and in some forms of renal disease. In addition to a direct action on arteries and arterioles, angiotensin II (All) , being one of the most potent endogenous vasoconstrictors known, exerts stimulation on the release of aldosterone from the adrenal 

cortex. Therefore, the renin-angiotensin system, by virtue of its participation in the control of renal sodium handling, plays an important role in cardiovascular hemeostasis. Interruption of the renin-angiotensin system with converting enzyme inhibitors, such as captopril, has proved to be clinically useful in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure (Abrams, .B., et al., (1984), Federation Pro . r l, 1314) . The most direct approach towards inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system would block the action of All at the receptor. Compelling evidence suggests that All also contributes to renal vasoconstriction and sodium retention that is characteristic of a number of disorders such as heart failure, cirrhosis and complications of pregnancy(Hollenberg, N.K., (1984), J. Cardiovas. Pharmacol . r £, S176) . In addition, recent animal studies suggest that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system may be beneficial in halting or slowing the progression of chronic renal failure (Anderson, S., et al., (1985), J. Clin. Invest. r 76, 612) . Also, a recent patent application (South African Patent Application No. 87/01,653) claims that All antagonists are useful as agents for reducing and controlling elevated intraocular pressure, especially glaucoma, in mammals.The compounds of this invention inhibit, block and antagonize the action of the hormone All, and are therefore useful in regulating and moderating
