<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil 
composition, and more specifically, it relates to a lubricating 
oil composition which comprises as the main components, 
a base oil, a specific hindered phenol compound, a 
specific alkylated diphenylamine compound and a borated 
succinic acid imide compound, is excellent in heat resistance 
and oxidation stability, and stably functions for a 
long period of time particularly as a traction drive oil, a 
compressor oil or the like which is exposed to a high 
temperature in a mist-like state. In recent years, continuously variable transmissions 
(CVT) of traction drives for cars have shifted toward 
the increase in transmission power, the miniaturization of 
size and the freedom from maintenance. With this shift, a 
lubricating oil is required to have heat resistance and 
oxidation stability at a high temperature, and the level of 
these requirements is rising year by year. Heretofore, research and development have been made 
mainly to secure the heat resistance and the oxidation 
stability at a high temperature in the so-called oily phase 
portion, and therefore the already developed lubricating 
oils can scarcely inhibit heat deterioration and oxidation 
deterioration in a gaseous phase portion.  
 DE-A-29 48 020 discloses a flame-retardant working oil which comprises an acid ester of 
a polyol, 0.5 parts pentaerythritol-tetrakis-[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)]-propionate, 
and 0.5 parts p,p'-dialkyldiphenylamine. The total amount of hindered phenol 
and dialkyldiphenylamine is 1.0 parts. A borated succinimide compound is not mentioned. EP-A-0 346 283 discloses a lubricating oil composition having oxidation resistance which 
comprises a mineral oil or synthetic oil and 0.1 % of a hindered phenol and 0.45 % 4,4'-di-tert-octyldiphenylamine. 
The ratio of the amount of amine to hindered phenol is 4.5, 
and the total amount of phenol and amine is 0.55 %. There is no disclosure for the use of 
a borated succinic acid imide compound. US-A-5,167,1844 discloses an oxidation-resistant lubricant which is obtained by adding 
diphenylamine and the ester of Î²-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid and 
polyvalent alcohols to a mineral oil or a synthetic oil. The compounding ratio of amine to 
phenol is 3-5 : 1. The use of a borated succinic acid imide compound is not disclosed. EP-A-0 208 541 discloses a lubricant composition for use in traction drives comprising an 
alkenyl succinimide boride. However, the composition does not comprise a
