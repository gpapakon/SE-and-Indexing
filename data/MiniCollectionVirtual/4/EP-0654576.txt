A needle contact element of a safety contact rail for power-actuated plant
and for safeguarding machines or areas, with a first and a second section

which have electrically-conducting zones arranged insulated from one
another through which an electrically-conducting litz wire is fully inserted,

wherein the needle contact elements can be inserted into the zones or into
the litz wires and trigger a switching pulse through the mutual contact

brought about by deformation of the safety contact rail, with the said
switching pulse transmissible to an evaluation unit via switching lines

connected to the zones
characterised in that
 the needle contact element is a needle contact pin (1)
with a needle tip (2a, 2b) at either end, that the needle contact pin (1) has

a circumferential annular web (3) arranged very nearly centrally and that the
litz wires can be displaced within and/or withdrawn from a channel (4a, 4b)

accommodating the litz wire in the electrically-conducting zones (5a, 5b).
A needle contact element according to claim 1
characterised in that
 the needle contact pin (1) can be inserted in the
retaining section (13) through the needle tip (2a) projecting out of a retaining

section (13).
A needle contact element according to claim 1 or 2
characterised in that
 the needle contact pin (1) can be cut to length.
A needle contact element according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that
 the needle contact tips (2a, 2b) each subtend an angle
of 50° to 90°, and preferably 70°. 
A needle contact element according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that
 the needle contact pin (1) tapers conically to the needle
contact tips (2a, 2b) on both sides of the annular web (3).
A needle contact element according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that
 the diameter of the needle contact pin (1) ) and the litz
wire is very nearly the same.
A needle contact element according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that
 the needle contact pin (1) is manufactured from a
corrosion-resistant material.
The use of a needle contact element of a safety contact rail according to
one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 needle contact pins (1) for connection of safety contact
rail elements (16a, 16b) can be inserted in the electrically-conducting zones

(5a, 5b) of the safety contact rail elements (16a, 16b) to be joined together.
The use of a needle contact element of a safety contact rail according to
one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 needle contact pins (1) for the manufacture of an
angular section (11a, 11b) of a safety contact rail can be pushed through

the conducting zones (5a, 5b) of the safety contact rail sections to be joined
together to generate the angle and the needle contact pins (1) ) project over

a partial length out of the exit points from the safety contact rail section
lying opposite the entry point. 
The use of a needle contact element of a safety contact rail according to
one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the retaining section (13) with the needle contact pins
(1) can be joined to a connecting cable (15) and a cover plate (14) to yield

a connecting end section (12).
The use of a needle contact element of a safety contact rail according to
one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the retaining section (13) with the needle contact pins
(1) ) are provided with an electrical component which can be secured to the

needle contact pins (1) in an electrically-conducting manner to yield an
electrical functional part.
