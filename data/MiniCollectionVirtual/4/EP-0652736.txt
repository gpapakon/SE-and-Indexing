<ABSTRACT>
In a sanitary napkin (10), the retention layer (34) of the absorbent core is covered by a first tissue sheet of a density between 0.01 g/cm3 and 0.1 g/cm3 and by a second tissue sheet of a density between 0.08 and 0.3 g/cm3, the difference in density between the tissue sheets being between 0.01 g/cm3 and 0.2 g/cm3. The density gradient on top of the retention layer (34) results in a relatively high efficiency of the retention layer (34) and in efficient draining of the topmost tissue sheet, so that chances of rewet are reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to sanitary napkin having a liquid pervious topsheet,
a liquid-impervious backsheet and an absorbent core having a caliper of
less than 5 mm, the absorbent core comprising a retention layer of
absorbent material and at least a first and a second tissue sheet located
between the retention layer and the topsheet.Such a sanitary napkin is known from the American patent US-A-5,009,653
(& EP-A- 0 336 578).In this patent a sanitary napkin is described having a core consisting of a
laminate of two air-laid tissue sheets between which a layer of hydro-gel
forming material is comprised. The absorbent core is of relatively low
caliper, for instance smaller than 2 mm. In order to improve the
efficiency of the absorbent gelling material comprised in the core, a wipe
acquisition sheet is located over the laminate, close to the topsheet, to
improve lateral spread of liquids. The wipe acquisition sheet can be a
70%-30% rayon-polyester fiber sheet having a basis weight of 0.005
g/cm2 and a thickness of about 0.04 cm and is available under the
tradename "Sontara" and marketed by E.I. DuPont Nemours Company.Underneath the wipe acquisition sheet, a wet-laid tissue is located which
serves to confine any loose absorbent gelling material, improves lateral
wicking, provides some degree of absorbency and reduces the flow of
fluids already absorbed in the absorbent core back to the topsheet. The 
wet-laid tissue has a basis weight of about 15.8 g/m2.EP-A- 169 184 discloses absorbent bodies
comprising bondable fibers which are formed
into a coherent body. The absorbent bodies so
formed are given a permanent continues density which is gradually
increasing in a direction
away from the user of articles which contain
such absorbent bodies. This disclosure lacks
any hint as to a layered structure having
a selected difference between the densities of adjacent layers. In the known sanitary napkin, retention of fluids in the upper tissue,
which is located near the topsheet, can take place. This can lead to
migration of body fluids from the upper tissue back through the topsheet
(rewetting).It is an object of the invention to provide a sanitary napkin of relatively
small caliper and increased transport of fluids towards the retention layer
and a relatively low chance of rewetting.It is another object of the invention to provide a sanitary napkin having an
improved fluid distribution and a relatively high effective capacity
(capacity before soiling occurs).The sanitary napkin according to the invention is
