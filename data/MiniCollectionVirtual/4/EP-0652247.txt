<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing epoxy-modified
silicones and, more particularly, to a method of producing
highly pure epoxy-modified silicones wherein the gelation due to the
ring-opening polymerization of epoxides can be inhibited and whereby
the production efficiency can be raised.Hitherto, there have been known various methods for the
production of organosilicones containing epoxy groups. Representatives
thereof are the method of causing an olefinic group-containing siloxane
to undergo a peroxidation reaction (e.g., peroxidizing vinylsiloxane
with a 40 % peracetic acid solution), the method of epoxidizing the
siloxanes which have in advance undergone a Grignard reaction, e.g.,
those having the group of formula ≡ SiCH2MgBr, through an alkali
treatment in the presence of epichlorohydrin, the method of reacting
chlorosilane or acetoxysilane with glycidol to produce glycidyl silicone
ether (U.S. Patent 2,730,532), and so forth.However, those methods all are disadvantageous in that they are
low in yield, require troublesome operations, and cannot secure
consistent production.For an industrial purpose, on the other hand, the monomers,
oligomers and polymers of epoxysilicones are generally produced by the
addition reaction (hydrosilylation reaction) between olefin epoxides and
Si-H containing siloxanes or silanes in the presence of platinum
catalyst or a catalyst for hydrosilylation use which contains platinum
as main component (Japanese Tokko Sho 43-25926, and Japanese Tokkai Sho
56-38350 and Hei 3-128975, wherein the term "Tokko" as used herein 
means an "examined patent publication" and the term "Tokkai" as used
herein means an "unexamined published patent application").However, the platinum catalysts are known to function not only as
catalyst for the addition reaction between an olefin and Si-H but also
as catalyst for the ring-opening polymerization of epoxides in the
presence of Si-H.More specifically, Japanese Tokkai Hei 3-152128 discloses the
method of promoting the ring-opening reaction of epoxides by use of
platinum catalyst or a catalyst containing platinum as main component.
In addition, that reference recites acetonitrile, methanol and 2-methyl-4-butene-3-ine
as materials acting so as to inhibit epoxides from
undergoing the ring-opening reaction. However, it has no description
of the method for the production of epoxy-modified silicones.At present the production of an epoxy-modified silicone is
carried out adopting the method in which the batch temperature and the
