<ABSTRACT>
A multiple-speed ratio transmission mechanism for an 
automotive vehicle includes a torque input shaft (12) 

supported on a first axis, and an output shaft (14) and 
intermediate shaft (16) rotatably supported parallel to the 

input shaft (12). Multiple pinion-gear pairs (26, 36, 28, 
40, 30, 42) are supported on the three shafts (12, 14, 16). 

A planetary gear unit (98), including a sun gear (104), ring 
gear (100), and a set of planet pinions (106) rotatably 

supported on a carrier (108), has its input connected to the 
intermediate shaft (16) and its output connected to the 

output shaft (14). Synchronisers (52, 68, 82) driveably 
connect a member of the pinion-gear pairs to one of the 

shafts. A shift mechanism transmits motion of a shift lever 
(122) to shift forks (146, 148) that move synchroniser 

sleeves (57, 70, 84) into engagement with the selected gear.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the arrangement of gears,
shafts, and synchronisers of an automotive transmission,
especially to such a transmission of the type having an
input shaft supported on a first axis, and an output shaft
and intermediate shaft arranged parallel to the input shaft.When the engine of a motor vehicle is idling and the
neutral clutch that connects the engine to a manual
transmission is disengaged, the speed of the engine varies
as a result of cyclic irregularity intrinsic in the
operation of an internal combustion engine. Countershaft
manual transmissions for automotive use contain gear sets
whose members are in continuous meshing engagement, though
the gear selector of the transmission is in the neutral
position. When the main drive clutch is engaged and the
gear selector is in the neutral position, speed changes of
the engine transmitted to the gearset produce noise called
"neutral rollover gear rattle." When the engaged gear teeth
change position with respect to each other due to engine
speed variations, the teeth of the driven gear contact
alternately the driving face and the non driving face of the
driving pinion.To reduce or eliminate this objectionable noise,
various devices have been employed to take up clearances
between the faces of the gear and mating pinion. These
devices include a wheel coaxially arranged with the gear
having similar teeth to those of the gear, and means for
elastically maintaining the teeth of the gear in position
that is angularly offset relative to the gear. A mechanical
spring, usually a helical spring, located radially offset
from the axis of the gear, applies a force directed
tangentially to the axis tending to rotate the angular
element with respect to the gear wheel. Other means such as
elastomeric material have been used in the prior art to bias
an angular member angularly with respect to a gear to 
maintain contact between the gear teeth in order to avoid
gear rattle.U.S. Patent 4,718,295 describes use of a one-way
clutch located on the input shaft between a gear wheel and a
cylindrical surface of the shaft. The one-way clutch
permits a one-way drive connection so that power can be
transmitted through the clutch from the input shaft to
either of two countershafts when fourth and fifth gear
ratios are selected by the vehicle operatorMoreover, German Patent Specification DE-A-41 09 832,
from which the features of the first part of claim 1 are
known, describes a vehicle transmission for producing
multiple speed ratios, comprising:
a) an input shaft
