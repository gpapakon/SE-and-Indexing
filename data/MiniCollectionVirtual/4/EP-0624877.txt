<ABSTRACT>
A storage rack is described consisting of a base (112), 
a substantially vertical support rod (116) and a plurality 

of storage clips (120) rotatably mounted on the rod. Each 
clip is adapted to retain the corner of a CD-case (14) lying 

in a predetermined first plane relative thereto and to 
permit the CD-case so retained to be opened. The clip (120) 

is arranged so that the retained CD-case (14) and the axis 
of rotation (150) of the clip about the support rod are so 

positioned relative to one another that rotation by no more 
than about 90° is sufficient to remove a CD-case (14') from 

the stack and enable it to be opened. The clips (120) 
consist of a support shelf (130), first (122) and second 

(124) retaining walls which engage the edges of the CD-case 
and a cantilevered gripping member (118) which grips the 

hinge region of the case. Rotation by no more than about 
90° enables the rack to be used where space is at a premium 

and also means that the printed matter in a swung-out CD-case 
(14') runs, from a user's point of view, from left to 

right, enabling convenient verification that the correct 
choice has been made.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to storage racks for compact
discs and in particular to racks comprising a base, an
elongate, vertical support and a plurality of storage clips
rotatably mounted on the support. Each clip retains a CD-case
and can be individually rotated about the support
allowing the easy location and removal of any CD in a short
space of time.With the continued popularity of the CD, a number of
storage racks of the type described above are now available.
One such rack is described and illustrated in W092/22902.
Each of the clips is designed to grip the hinge region of a
CD-case, i.e. the region of the case adjacent to its spine
where the hinged lid is cut away. This arrangement enables
the CD-case to be opened while it is retained in the clip,
since the clip will not interfere with any parts of the lid.
The clips may be positioned anywhere on the hinge region of
a CD-case, other than at either end, since they would there
interfere with the lateral sides of the hinged lid and
prevent the case from being opened. The existing designs of
clip include a lug with a cylindrical hole passing through
it, by means of which a plurality of clips may be mounted
upon a vertical support rod. The lug is positioned
centrally on the clip.These existing storage racks possess a number of
disadvantages. Firstly, since the clip is designed to grip
the hinge region of the CD-case, the support rod on which it
is mounted, and indeed the clip itself, obscures to some
extent the spine of the CD-case. Since it is upon the spine
of the case that details of the recorded music are printed,
this can sometimes make it difficult to identify a
particular CD.A second disadvantage with the known designs is that,
swinging a selected CD-case sufficiently about the support 
rod to enable it to clear neighbouring CDs and thus be
opened, requires rotation by approximately 180°. This means
that the storage rack requires an amount of floor - or table
- space which is rather larger than may be expected, so that
there is sufficient clearance to allow this 180° rotation to
take place. A further disadvantage of 180° rotation is that
the user, having selected by viewing the spine the CD which
he wishes to play and then rotated the appropriate case out
of the rack to enable it to be opened, will then have a view
of the front face of the CD-case in which the printed matter
runs from top to bottom as he looks at it, rather than from
left to right. Since one would normally glance at the front
face of the CD-case to verify that one has selected

<CLAIMS>
A storage clip (120) receiving and retaining the hinge edge
of a CD-case (14) lying in a predetermined first plane

relative thereto,
the clip being adapted to form a stack with a

plurality of identical clips such that the clips are
rotatable relative to one another from a first position in which the CD-case is normally stored to a swung-out position in which the CD-case can be opened about a common axis (150)

substantially normal to the said first plane; characterised in that the clip grips the CD-case near a corner whereby a second
predetermined plane (152) containing the said axis, and

making an angle of 45 degrees with the edges of the CD-case
so retained which meet at the said corner in the first position of the CD-case, does not pass

through the CD-case itself.
A clip according to claim 1 in which a CD-case so
retained in any one clip of the stack may be opened,

unobstructed by adjacent clips and/or retained CD-cases,
once the said one clip has been rotated by 90 degrees

relative to its neighbours.
A clip according to any preceding claim, in which the
clip includes a shelf (130) lying in the first plane and a

gripping member (118) cantilevered relative to the shelf and
adapted to grip the hinge region of a CD-case to retain the

CD-case in the clip.
A clip according to claim 3, in which the clip includes
a first retaining wall (122) substantially perpendicular to

and attached to the shelf and adapted to engage a lateral
edge of a retained CD-case.
A clip according to claim 3 or claim 4, in which the
clip includes a second retaining wall (124) substantially

perpendicular to both the first retaining wall and the shelf
and attached to the latter, adapted to engage the spine of

a retained CD-case and from which the gripping member is
cantilevered. 
A clip according to claim 5, in which the gripping
member is spaced from the first retaining wall to permit a

retained CD-case to be opened.
A clip according to any preceding claim, in which the
clip is adapted to engage an elongate support (116) for

rotation about a longitudinal axis of the support,
coincident with the said common axis.
A clip according to claim 7, in which the clip includes
an attachment lug (132) with a substantially cylindrical

hole (134) centred on the said axis passing through it.
A storage stack comprising a plurality of clips
rotatable relative to one another about a common axis, each

clip being a clip according to any one of claims 1 to 8.
A stack according to claim 9 including an elongate
support (116) on which the clips may be mounted for rotation

about the said axis.
A stack according to claim 9 wherein each of said clips
is a clip according to claim 8, the stack including an

elongate support rod (116) about which the clips may be
mounted with the support rod passing through the

substantially cylindrical hole in each clip.
A storage rack comprising a base and a stack according
to claim 10 or claim 11, the elongate support being attached

to the base and being substantially vertical at rest.
A storage rack comprising a base and a plurality of
stacks according to claim 10 or claim 11, the elongate

supports being arranged around and attached to the base and
being substantially vertical at rest.
A rack according to claim 13 including a central column
(128), substantially vertical at rest, against which a CD-case 

retained in any clip in the said plurality of stacks
can impinge to define its stored position.
