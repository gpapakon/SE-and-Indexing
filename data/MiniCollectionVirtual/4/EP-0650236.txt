<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an electrical high-voltage switching installation having metal encapsulation (1) which has at least two parts (2, 3) which are connected to one another in a gas-tight manner by means of flanges (4, 5), an annular core current transformer is provided which has an annular body (6) with an annular cavity (11) in which the annular cores (toroidal cores) (12, 13) are arranged, the annular body (6) having on its side facing the interior of the metal encapsulation (1) a circumferential gap which connects the annular cavity (11) to the interior of the metal encapsulation (1). The same flanges (4, 5) can be used with or without the installation of an annular core current transformer.

<CLAIMS>
Electrical high-voltage switchgear having a 
metal enclosure (1), which has at least two portions 

(2, 3) which are connected together in a gas-tight 
manner by means of flanges (4, 5), and having a 

toroidal-core current transformer which has an annular 
body (6) which is arranged between the flanges (4, 5), 

is connected to the latter in a gas-tight manner, 
surrounds a high-voltage conductor and supports at 

least one toroidal core (12, 13), wherein the annular 
body (6) is made of metal and also has an annular 

cavity (11) in which the toroidal core/cores (12, 13) 
is/are arranged, characterised in that the annular body 

(6) has, on its side facing the interior of the metal 
enclosure (1), a circumferential gap which connects the 

annular cavity (11) with the interior of the metal 
enclosure (1), and in that the annular body (6) is 

formed as a component which is separate from the 
flanges. 
Electrical high-voltage switchgear according 
to claim 1, characterised in that the annular body (6) 

consists of two partial bodies (7, 8) which are annular 
in each case, are
 formed so as to be substantially 
identical and enclose between them the annular cavity 

(11). 
Electrical high-voltage switchgear according 
to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that seals are 

arranged between the annular body (6) and the flanges 
(4, 5) in the area of the annular body (6) which, 

viewed from the cavity (11), lies radially on the 
outside.
