<ABSTRACT>
A cannula insertion needle (50) projects from the "forward" 
end of a hollow handle (10). After use to start a cannula, the 

needle is released from the end of the handle and its sharp 
end (52) retracted into the handle, beyond reach. Preferably 

the handle has an aperture (23) big enough for the needle but 
too small for fingertips. In one preferred form of the 

invention, the needle rides in a carrier block (30) that slides 
inside the handle. Initially the block is secured in the 

handle against the forward end, with the sharp end of the 
needle protruding outward through the aperture. A manually 

releasable latch (40) holds the block in this position. The 
latch mechanism includes mutually interfering stop elements 

on the exterior of the block and interior of the handle. 
After the cannula is in place, the person using the device 

withdraws the needle from the patient and manually triggers 
the carrier-block latch (42) by squeezing or rotating one of the 

stop elements out of engagement with the other. Then a 
coiled spring (61) drives the block rearward to retract the 

needle into the handle. At the rear end of the handle a 
stop (13) halts the carrier block and needle so that they are 

safely confined within the handle. A standard size tube 
fitting on the rear of the handle and a hollow needle 

permit liquid flow to or from the patient through the 
handle temporarily.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to medical 
appliances; and more particularly to a device for inserting 
a cannula -- such as an intravenous cannula -- into a 
patient's body. As is well known, there are myriad very important 
medical uses for intravenous and intraarterial tubes and 
other indwelling catheters. It is also known in the 
medical community that a severe problem has developed in 
relation to all such devices. That problem arises from the continuing presence of 
horrible diseases, particularly fatal and currently 
incurable diseases such as acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome ("AIDS") and hepatitis, transmitted by exchange of 
body substances between people. These diseases have led 
medical institutions to exclusively use disposable needles 
for injections and for catheter or cannula implants. A severe residual risk remains, however, for medical 
personnel themselves in the inadvertent touching of needle 
tips after withdrawal from infected patients. Medical 
needles are designed and manufactured specifically to be  
 
extremely sharp and to puncture skin and flesh with only 
the slightest pressure. As a result, what would ordinarily be an 
inconsequential scratch or pinprick can bring and has 
brought severe disease or even death to many medical staff 
members and others. Needless to say, health-care 
professionals are well aware of this risk and take 
considerable precautions to avoid such inadvertent 
punctures; thus the risk is reduced on a "probability" 
basis to an exceedingly small value. Nevertheless, the exposure is so massive for working 
doctors, nurses and technicians that occasional punctures 
are inevitable. As a practical matter, it is virtually 
impossible for such an individual to reduce the incidence 
of accidental puncture to less than, say, one every year or 
perhaps one every few years. Of course, not every such puncture follows 
contamination of the needle by a patient carrying a 
transmissible fatal disease. Nevertheless, there are 
enough medical personnel and enough such patients that a 
significant number of medical staffers die -- and of course 
a greater number become very sick -- from these accidents. In discussion of this problem, needles of the types 
used with syringes commonly come to prominence. Though the 
word "hypodermic" has somewhat passed out of current usage 
in the medical profession, for purposes of 
definiteness and simplicity reference is made to needles used with 
syringes for giving injections as "hypodermic needles."
