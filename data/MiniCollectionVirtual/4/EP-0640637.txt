<ABSTRACT>
A biodegradable optically active copolymer has the 
general formula (I): 


wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ each represent a hydrogen atom 
or a methyl group; m and n are each a natural number of 

which the sum is from 10 to 5,000; and C* is an asymmetric 
carbon atom. The copolymer (I) is produced by ring-opening 

copolymerization of optically active β-butyrolactone with 
a cyclic carbonate in the present of e.g. a tin-, aluminum- 

or zinc-based, preferably a distannoxane catalyst. The 
copolymer (I) has excellent 

biodegradability (enzyme degradability) and hydrolyzability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to biodegradable 
optically active copolymers obtained by ring-opening copolymerization 
of an optically active β-butyrolactone with 
various cyclic carbonates and to processes for their production. A type of thermoplastic resin known as biodegradable 
polymers, which have characteristics such as enzyme degradability, 
hydrolyzability and biocompatibility, are 
known, and have attracted particular attention as functional 
polymers on account of their excellent properties. One example of such biodegradable polymers, 
poly((R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid), is a polymer accumulated 
in microorganisms. Further, the existence of a number 
of microorganisms which accumulate polymers of various 
(R)-3-hydroxyalkanoic acids (hereinafter abbreviated as 
"(R)-3-HA") in their cells are also known (P.A. Holms, 
Phys. Technol., Vol. 16, pp. 32-36, 1985; Seibunkaisei 
Kobunchi Zairyo (Biodegradable Polymer Materials), edited 
by Yoshiharu Doi Kogyo Chosakai, pp. 26-30, November 9, 1990). Since the polymers accumulated in these microorganisms 
are easily degraded by microorganisms existing in soil 
and water, they can be widely used as clean plastics free 
of environmental pollution (Seibunkaisei Kobunshi Zairyo 
(Biodegradable Polymer Materials), edited by Yoshiharu Doi,  
 
Kogyo Chosakai, pp. 19-26, November 9, 1990). As methods of producing these polymers, methods 
utilizing the above-mentioned microorganisms have firstly 
been considered. However, such methods have the disadvantage 
of requiring complex processes such as the separation of 
the polymers from cells, resulting in hish cost of production, 
because of the utilization of a microorganism or 
enzymatic reaction. Further, most of the polymers produced 
contain (R)-3-HA units and 4-hydroxybutyric acid units, 
and polymers containing carbonate units have not been reported. On the other hand, chemical synthetic methods for 
producing the biodegradable polymers are also known. For 
example, ring-opening polymerization of optically active 
β-butyrolactone has been reported in some documents [Polymer 
Letters, 9, 173 (1971); Macromolecules, 23, 3206 (1990); 
Macromolecules, 24, 5732 (1991)]. These methods do not require complex processes such 
as those in microbiological synthesis, but pose many industrial 
problems due to the low molecular weight of the polymers 
obtained and the low catalytic reactivity, which again 
result in high cost of production. Polymers composed of cyclic carbonates and lactones 
are already known. For example,
