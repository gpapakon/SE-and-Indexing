<DESCRIPTION>
 TELERADIOLOGY SYSTEM BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to a system for data acquisition and transmission. More particularly, the present invention relates to transmitting radiological images from a base radiology site to a remote site.Teleradiology involves the transmission of digitized radiological images to an off-site or receive location for medical diagnosis purposes. The most common transmission site is a hospital; the usual receive site is the doctor's home or office.When a patient or trauma victim is brought into a hospital, the patient may undergo one or more radiological processes.Current radiological processes include CAT or CT Scan (Computerized Axial Tomography) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) , Nuclear Medicine Imaging (NMI) , Ultrasound and X-ray. Depending on schedules, work-load, emergencies, budget constraints, etc., a radiologist may not be available in the hospital at any given time to read the image(s) . With teleradiology, a radiologist can expand the territory covered by reviewing transmitted images at a remote office or site. Most frequently, the images are transmitted over standard telephone lines. However, with the advent of cellular telephones, digital cellular radio, fiber optics, and satellite communications, transmission medium is no longer limited to standard telephone lines.In practice, an imaging or radiological device scans the traumatized tissue. The raw digitized data is converted to a video signal and displayed on the associated monitor or display device. Most imaging or radiological devices utilize a means for storing the raw data. Further, most imaging devices compress the raw data before it is stored. The most common storage devices are disc drives (either 8 inch, 5.25 inch or 3.5 inch) , tape drives or laser disc drives. The storage medium is for archival purposes. A radiological cross-sectional scan of a particular area of a patient's body is called a "slice". The slices are typically five (5) millimeters apart. A collection of slices is called a study. Although it may contain any number of slices, a typical study usually contains from 20 to 40 slices. 

 A data matrix may be used to depict each slice. The most common data matrix consists of 256 by 256 available data points. However, the matrix size can vary. For example, the Elscint CT Scan, model no. 1800. allows the operator to choose from three different matrix sizes, namely 256 x 256; 340 x 340; and 512 x 512. Each point within the matrix may be
