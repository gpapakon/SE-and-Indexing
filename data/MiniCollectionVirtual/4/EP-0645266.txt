disposed between unsprung mass and sprung mass of a suspension 

mechanism in an automative vehicle and provided with 
an electrically operated control valve (14a) for changing 

damping characteristics of vertical displacement of the 
sprung mass relative to the unsprung mass, wherein absolute 

vertical displacement velocity (V
Z1
) of the sprung mass and 
relative vertical displacement velocity (V
Y1
) of the sprung 
mass to the unsprung mass are detected to determine a 

target opening degree (X
S1
) of the control valve (14a) in 
accordance with the detected absolute vertical displacement 

velocity (V
Z1
) and relative vertical displacement velocity 
(V
Y1
) of the sprung mass, and where variation of the target 
opening degree (X
S1
) is allowed in a large range only when 
the direction of the relative vertical displacement velocity 

(V

small range under other conditions where the shock absorber 

acts to absorb vibration of the vehicle body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric control 
apparatus for a shock absorber disposed between unsprung 
mass and sprung mass of a suspension mechanism in an automotive 
vehicle and provided with an electrically operated 
control valve to be electrically controlled for changing 
damping characteristics of vertical displacement of the 
sprung mass relative to the unsprung mass. Disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 
3-276807 is a conventional electric control apparatus of 
this kind, wherein absolute vertical displacement velocity 
of the sprung mass and relative vertical displacement 
velocity of the sprung mass to the unsprung mass are detected 
to control the damping coefficient of the shock 
absorber on a basis of the skyhook theory proposed by D. 
Karnopp. In this control apparatus, an opening degree of 
the control valve is decreased in accordance with an increase 
of a difference between the absolute vertical displacement 
velocity and the relative vertical displacement  
 
velocity to increase the damping coefficient of the shock 
absorber and is increased in accordance with a decrease of 
the difference between the absolute vertical displacement 
velocity and the relative vertical displacement velocity to 
decrease the damping coefficient of the shock absorber. In such control of the damping coefficient, however, 
the difference between the absolute vertical displacement 
velocity and the relative vertical displacement velocity 
changes from a positive value to a negative value or vice-versa 
if either the absolute vertical displacement velocity 
or the relative vertical displacement velocity changes in 
its sign from positive to negative or vice-versa. In such 
an instance, the opening degree of the control valve is 
greatly changed to cause sudden change of the damping 
coefficient of the shock absorber. In other words, when 
the relative vertical displacement velocity is maintained 
to be approximately zero, the damping force of the shock 
absorber is changed in a small range, In this instance, 
the passenger is not applied with any large shock. If the 
relative vertical displacement velocity is not maintained 
to be approximately zero, the damping force of the shock 
absorber changes in a large range. In this instance, the 
passenger is applied with a large shock. It is, therefore, a primary object of the present 
invention to provide an electric control apparatus for a  
 
shock absorber capable of controlling the control valve in 
such a manner that the passenger is
