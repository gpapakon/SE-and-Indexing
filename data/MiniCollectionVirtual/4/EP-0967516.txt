<ABSTRACT>
A frame counter device includes a rotatable counter disk
(13, 22, 33). A train of plural numbers (15, 23, 34) are

arranged on one face of the counter disk in an arc shape, and
have an outermost point and an innermost point. The outermost

point is the farthest from a rotational center of the
counter disk and distant from the rotational center by a

radius Ro. The innermost point is the nearest to the rotational
center and distant from the rotational center by a

radius Ri. The radius Ri is 60 % or less of the radius Ro.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frame counter device
for frame counting of photo film. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a frame counter device for
counting up or down at each time when one frame is exposed on
photo film, in which a counted number can be clearly indicated.A camera or a lens-fitted photo film unit incorporates a
frame counter device, which counts and indicates the number
of frames exposed on photo film or the number of frames
remaining unexposed on the photo film. The frame counter
device includes a counter disk and a counter window. The
counter disk has a train of numbers arranged on its top face
in an arc shape. The counter disk is rotated by one step at
each time when the photo film is wound by one frame. The
counter window renders one number in the train number observable
externally. A pointer is printed on the outside of the
camera or a cardboard wrapper around the lens-fitted photo
film unit, and has a triangular shape or the like to point
the center of the window.The lens-fitted photo film unit includes a housing,
which incorporates a simple mechanism for taking exposures. 
The housing is loaded with an unused photo film cassette in a
state where unexposed photo film is entirely drawn from it
and provisionally wound in a roll form. When a winder wheel
of the lens-fitted photo film unit is rotated after exposing
each frame, the photo film is wound into the photo film
cassette by a length of one frame. After exposing all available
frames, the lens-fitted photo film unit is simply forwarded
to a photo laboratory without rewinding operation.
The photo film in the lens-fitted photo film unit is subjected
to photofinishing, before photo prints are supplied to the
user and the photo film being developed is returned to him or
her.There is an IX-240 type of the photo film cassette
recently widespread and used in a system referred to as
"Advanced Photo System" (trade name). The IX-240 type of the
photo film cassette is characterized in its small size. The
volume of the IX-240 type of the photo film cassette is 75 %
as small as that of the conventional 135 type of the photo
film cassette. The size of the camera and the lens-fitted
photo film unit for use with the IX-240 type of the photo
film cassette is reduced. Accordingly, the counter disk has
a small size. It is likely that the numbers arranged in the
train on the counter disk are very small and difficult for
users to recognize exactly and quickly.In the photo film cassette of the IX-240 type, there is
no perforation
