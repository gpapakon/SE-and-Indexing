<CLAIMS>
Process for the crystallization of methionine, 
characterized in that the crystallization is carried out 

in the presence of an aluminium salt of an organic acid. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the organic acid is soluble in water. 
Process according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the organic acid contains at most 

8 carbon atoms and preferably at most 4 carbon atoms. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the organic acid is an acid 

alcohol. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the organic acid is a polycarboxylic 

acid. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the organic acid is chosen from 

lactic acid, glycolic acid and acetic acid. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the amount by weight of aluminium 

salt of the organic acid, expressed as aluminium 
equivalent calculated with respect to the methionine, is 

between 500 and 5000 ppm and preferably between 500 and 
3000 ppm. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the pH of the crystallization 

solution is between 4.5 and 7 and preferably 
between 4.5 and 5.5.
