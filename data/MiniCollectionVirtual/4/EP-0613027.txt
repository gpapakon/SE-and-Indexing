<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for the detection of predetermined materials in the ground, in which probes are used at predetermined measuring points to measure the potential and convert it into digital electric signals which are transmitted to a central computing unit in which they are processed and then displayed and/or recorded. The probes are arranged in a planar region in a plurality of rows and arranged in the latter at approximately equal spacings from one another. The mutual spacing of the rows of the measuring points arranged in the ground essentially corresponds to the mutual spacing of the measuring points in the rows, and the potential differences are respectively determined between two measuring points situated in the same row as well as between two measuring points situated in different rows, preferably between all the measuring points.
