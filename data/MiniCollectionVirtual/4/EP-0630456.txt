<ABSTRACT>
Flange for pipe joints with pipes leading fluids under high pressure, where the flange comprises a contact surface (6, 7; 6a, 7a) which, when the securing bolts (3) for the pipe joints are not tightened, form an outwards directed angle to each other, and being forced towards each other when the securing bolts (3) are tightened. The flanges may also comprise outer and inner depending sections (8, 9; 10, 11) for further tightening effect, and may additionally possibly comprise washer/gasket grooves (12) and washers/gaskets (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
Coupling for flanged pipes, process for connecting the flanges and use of the coupling.The present invention concerns compact flanges for pipe connections for pipes carrying fluids under high pressure and/or being subject to large mechanical forces. Such flanges for pipe connections are used within offshore/sub- sea, process and/or landbased indurty and nuclear power plants, and especially for riser pipes and tension stays in the oil industry. A flange is in this connection each half of a pipe connection or a coupling. The words "connection half" or "flange" are often used alternately, but a coupling of such halves, said halves most often being similar but may be different, makes a pipe connection, and close-fitting pipe connections is the object of the present invention.Within this area there are several types of known technique for connective methods and devices for such connections of pipelines. The commonly known flanges/connections/clamps are sold under the names API-flanges, API clamps/hub, and they may also comprise threaded connections or couplings. Common for these connections and methods is that they are based on e.g. flat or "raised face" flange surfaces with surface gaskets, compact ring-groove washers or inwardly conical tightening elements.An example of such a known flange type is disclosed in GB patent 1.559.388 where there is shown a flat flange surface with a connection of the flange parts with conventional nuts.When connecting the flange parts there will also arise tensions in the flange material in the parts connecting the horizontal and the vertical flange parts. To distribute and relieve such material tensions it is known to give the transitional area between each flange part an elliptical shape. It is thus known from US patent 4.183.562 to give the surface the shape of a quarter of an ellipse in such an 

area, the larger axis of the ellipse being parallell with the pipe and this larger axis being about two times the length of its smaller axis. However, the tensions in the material in such a flange depends on the load points of the flange surface and on the tension forces in the pipe connection, so that this form of an elliptical transition is only advantageous for conventionally formed flange types of the kind mentioned above.A disadvantage in the existing flange connections is that there will often arise leaks after a time as a consequence of varying loads and high tensions combined with thermal strains and vibrations. In connection with this it is often necessary to perform
