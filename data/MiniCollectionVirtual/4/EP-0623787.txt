<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to stoves, especially
cooking stoves.Domestic kitchen stoves, as well as other stoves, are
typically intended for cooking, frying, boiling and the
like, by heating food contained in vessels. Installment of
a stove usually requires significant space, often at the
expense of an already existing table, counter or cupboard,
and sometimes a specially designed surface has to be set up.
In addition, use of a stove generates hard to clean dirt
from oily sediment which is difficult to reach because of
the many elements which comprise the stove. Moreover,
safety is a prerequisite condition for any stove, since gas
leakage, liquid gas spillage, or electric shock are
dangerous to the operator.U.K. Patent No. 2,112,127 relates to stove units that
are detachable from a base unit.Swiss Patent No. 185637 discloses a cooking range for
kitchens to allow space saving wherein the cooking range
swings around a fixed axis this cooking range, however, does 
not have a collar member as provided in the present
invention.An object of the present invention is to provide a
cooking stove which occupies little space, especially when
not in operation, is easy to clean and operate and conforms
to safety requirements.There is provided, therefore, in accordance with an
embodiment of the invention a stove comprising: a base
adapted for mounting on to a fixed object, at least one
burner unit, a fuel supply line extending between said
burner unit and a fuel source, a regulator for control of
fuel supply along said supply line, and mounting means for
pivotably mounting said burner unit onto said base, wherein
said base comprises a pipe member so as to comprise said
fluid supply line, said pipe member having a longitudinal
bore formed therein and further having a transverse bore
extending between said longitudinal bore and an exterior
surface of said pipe member, characterized in that said
mounting means comprise joint means having three serially
juxtaposed collar elements arranged along said pipe, wherein
said second collar element is mounted for selectable
rotation about said pipe, said first collar element having a
throughgoing bore whose one end forms a continuum with said
transverse bore of said pipe and whose other end exits at an
interface between said first and second collar elements,
said second collar element having a throughgoing bore whose 
first end is adapted to be aligned with the other end of
said bore of said first collar element and whose second end
is adapted to be connected to said burner
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A stove (1) comprising:

a base (9) adapted for mounting on to a fixed object,
at least one burner unit (11a - 11d),
a fuel supply line extending between said burner unit (11a - 11d)
and a fuel source,
a regulator (17) for control of fuel supply along said
supply line, and
mounting means (27) for pivotably mounting said burner unit (11a - 11d)
onto said base (9), wherein said base (9) comprises a pipe member (90)

so as to comprise said fluid supply line, said pipe member (90)
having a longitudinal bore (45) formed therein and further having

a transverse bore (47) extending between said longitudinal bore (45)
and an exterior surface of said pipe member (90), characterized

in that said mounting means (27) comprise joint means having
three serially juxtaposed collar elements (10, 122, 12) arranged along

said pipe member (90), wherein said second collar element (122) is mounted for
selectable rotation about said pipe member (90), said first collar

element (12) having a throughgoing bore (44) whose one end forms a
continuum with said transverse bore (47) of said pipe member (90) and whose

other end exits at an interface between said first (12) and
second (122) collar elements, said second collar element (122) having a

throughgoing bore (50) whose first end is adapted to be aligned 
with the other end of said bore of said first collar element (12)

and whose second end is adapted to be connected to said
burner unit (11a - 11d).
A stove according to Claim 1, and wherein said mounting
means (27) is adapted to permit pivoting of said burner unit (11a - 11d)

between an operative orientation, whereat cooking on said
burner unit (11a - 11d) is permitted, and a storage position.
A stove according to Claim 2, and wherein said
regulator (17) is an automatic fuel supply regulator and is

operative to permit fuel supply along said supply line when
said burner unit (11a - 11d) is in said operative orientation, and is

further operative to prevent fuel supply along said supply
line when said burner unit (11a - 11d) is not in said operative

orientation.
A stove according to Claim 3,and wherein said fuel
supply line extends through said mounting means (27) and said

automatic regulator (17) is formed integrally with said mounting
means (27).
A stove according to Claim 1, and wherein said at least
one burner unit comprises:


a burner head (15a - 15d); and
a generally rigid burner arm (13a - 13d) adapted to support said
burner head (15a - 15d) and further adapted for connection to said 

mounting means (27) and including means for conducting fuel along
said burner arm (13a - 13d) to said burner head (15a - 15d).
A stove according to Claim 3, and also comprising
additional fuel regulating means for regulating a supply of

fuel along said burner arm (13a - 13d) when said burner unit (11a - 11d) is in said
operative orientation.
A stove according to Claim 1, and wherein said burner
unit (11a - 11d) is adapted for releasable attachment to said base (9) via

snap-fit coupling means.

one burner unit comprises:


at least one fluid fuel burner unit; and
at least one electric burner unit (A).
A stove according to Claim 8, and wherein said electric
burner unit (A) comprises mounting means (207) for pivotably mounting 

said electric burner unit (A) on to said base (9), wherein said
mounting means (207) is adapted to permit pivoting of said burner

unit between an operative orientation, whereat cooking on
said burner unit is permitted, and a storage position.
A stove according to Claim 9, and also including
electrical supply means for permitting operation of said

electric burner unit (A) when in said operative orientation, and for
preventing operation thereof when said electric burner unit (A)

is not in said operative orientation.
