<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of providing an antihistaminic effect in a hepatically impaired patient in need thereof comprising administering to said patient an effective antihistaminic amount of a compound of formula (I) wherein R1 is hydrogen or hydroxy; R2 is hydrogen; or R1 and R2 taken together form a second bond between the carbon atoms bearing R1 and R2; n is an integer of from 1 to 5; R3 is -COOH or -COOalkyl wherein the alkyl moiety has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and is straight or branched; each of A and B is hydrogen or hydroxy with the proviso that at least one of A or B is hydrogen; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and individual isomers thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of
application Serial No. 07/880,801, filed May 11, 1992.Terfenadine, α-[4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenyl]-4-(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-1-piperidinebutanol,
is a known
antihistaminic agent which is currently available
commercially under the name Seldane® with a recommended
dosage of 60 mg B.I.D. (See PHYSICIAN'S DESK REFERENCE,
46th Edition, 1992, pp. 1349-50, Medical Economics Data, a
division of Medical Economics Company, Inc., Montvale, New
Jersey). Terfenadine is disclosed in the Carr et al. '217
patent [U.S. Patent No. 3,878,217, issued April 15, 1975].Terfenadine undergoes extensive (99%) first pass
metabolism to two primary metabolites, an active acid
metabolite and an inactive dealkylated metabolite. The
active acid metabolite has been identified as 4-[1-hydroxy-4-[4-(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-1-piperidinyl]butyl]-α,α-dimethyl-benzeneacetic acid. The acid metabolite has been
disclosed in the Carr et al. '129 patent [U.S. Patent No.
4,254,129, issued March 3, 1981] as an antihistaminic agent
having oral activity. Studies investigating the effect of
hepatic and renal insufficiency on the metabolism and
excretion of terfenadine are incomplete. Preliminary information indicates that in cases of
hepatic impairment, significant concentrations of unchanged
terfenadine can be detected with the rate of acid
metabolite formation being decreased. In subjects with
normal hepatic function, unchanged terfenadine plasma
concentrations have not been detected.Recently, it has been found that patients with impaired
hepatic function (alcohol cirrhosis, hepatitis), or on
ketoconazole or troleandomycin therapy, or having
conditions leading to QT prolongation (e.g., hypokalemia,
congenital QT syndrome), may experience cardiac events of
QT prolongation and/or ventricular tachycardia at the
recommended dose of terfenadine.Surprisingly, it appears that patients with impaired
hepatic function who are receiving terfenadine acid
metabolite in sufficient amount so as to provide an
antihistaminic effect will not experience cardiac events of
QT prolongation and/or ventricular tachycardia.The present invention relates to the use
of a compound of Formula
(1) 

wherein
R1 is hydrogen or hydroxy;R2 is hydrogen;or R1 and R2 taken together form a second bond between
the carbon atoms bearing R1 and R2;n is an integer of from 1 to 5;R3 is -COOH or -COOalkyl wherein the alkyl moiety has
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and is straight or branched;each of A and B is hydrogen or hydroxy with the proviso
