<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable needle mechanism for gastrointestinal use 
in combination with an endoscope. The needle is received 

within a catheter or sheath and is movable between a first 
position in which it projects out of the catheter and a 

second position in which it is withdrawn into the catheter. 
A rotatable knob is provided to adjust the extent of 

projection of the needle when it is in the first position 
thereby eliminating any necessity to trim the end of the 

catheter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adjustable needle
mechanism finding particular use in combination with an
endoscope.Endoscopes are used with injection needles to inject
gastrointestinal mucosa with liquid reagents to achieve
desired effects. For example, sclerosants may be injected
for esophageal varices and epinephrine may be injected to
control bleeding. In order to accomplish such treatment, a
needle mounted on the end of a long tube may be passed
through a channel of the endoscope to inject the desired
objective. The needle is shielded by a catheter within which
the needle and tube are received. When the endoscope is
properly located at the injection site, the needle is
projected from the end of the catheter and the injection is
effected.It has been found that the length of the catheter and the
tube can be affected between the time of manufacture of the
mechanism and the time of use in the endoscope. For example,
when the mechanism is sterilized the catheter may be
lengthened or shortened or the tube may be lengthened or
shortened resulting in the mechanism not projecting the
needle sufficiently for proper injection of reagent. Such a
problem may require the use of the mechanism to trim back the
catheter before use.Thus, the time of hospital personnel is not used
effectively and damage to the mechanism may result. US-A-3 774 606 discloses an
adjustable needle mechanism comprising
a catheter;
a first tube slidable within the catheter;
a head secured to one end of the catheter;
a hollow needle mounted on one end of the
first tube in communication with the first tube, the first tube
being slidable in the catheter to a first
position wherein the needle projects out of the
other end of the catheter and slidable in the
catheter to a second position wherein the needle is
withdrawn into the catheter;
a handle connected to the first tube,
the handle having a port communicating with the
tube; and
a handle stop member mounted on
the head in the path of the handle;
the handle being movable to move the needle to
the first position wherein the handle engages the handle
stop member.In order to provide the user with a possibility of varying the
needle tip projections, the distal face of the handle is
provided with a plurality of steps which are located at
different distances from the needle tip and which receive the
catheter hub.It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved
gastrointestinal needle mechanism.To this end, the invention provides an adjustable needle
mechanism comprising the

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable needle mechanism comprising

a catheter (10);
a first tube (11) slidable within the catheter (10);
a head (17) secured to one end of the catheter (10);
a hollow needle (12) mounted on one end of the first
tube (11) in communication with the first tube (11), the first

tube (11) being slidable in the catheter (10) to a first position
wherein the needle (12) projects out of the other end of the

catheter (10) and slidable in the catheter (10) to a second
position wherein the needle (12) is withdrawn into the

catheter (10);
a handle (21) having a recess facing the head and a
port communicating with the first tube;
the handle (21) including a metal tube (25) extending
from the port through the head (17) into the first tube (11)

and being fixed with the first tube (11);
a handle stop member (30) adjustably mounted on the
head (17) in the path of the handle (21) so that the metal tube

(25) extends through the handle stop member (30); 
the handle (21) being movable to move the needle (12)
to the first position wherein the handle (21) engages the

handle stop member (30) by receiving
an end portion of the handle

stop member (30)
in the said recess, the handle stop member (30) being

adjustable on the head (17) to change the distance that the
needle projects out of the catheter (10) when the needle (12)

is in the first position, the handle stop member (30) being
threadedly mounted (31) on the head (17) and being

adjustable to change the distance of needle (12) projection by
screwing the handle stop member (30) into or out of the head

(17), a tubular stop element (20) slidably receiving the metal
tube (25) and being fixed to the head (17), and a metal collar

(35) fixedly received on the metal tube (25) and arranged to
engage the tubular stop element (20) when the first tube (11)

is in the second position.
The adjustable needle mechanism of claim 1
wherein the handle (21) includes a liner lock fitting (22) which

provides the port, the liner lock fitting being fixed to the metal
tube (25).
