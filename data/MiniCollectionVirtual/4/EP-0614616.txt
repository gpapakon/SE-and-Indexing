<ABSTRACT>
A composition is provided that provides a 

nutritionally complete, calorically-dense formulation 
suitable for use as a supplement or total enteral 

feeding. The composition is specifically tailored to 
meet the requirements of hepatic patients in need of 

nutritional support. In contrast to current hepatic 
formulas, the composition is ready-to-use and does not 

require reconstitution and admixing. The ready-to-use 
formula contains a protein source that contains at least 

25% of its total protein content as free crystalline 
amino acids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
compositions for treating patients who have hepatic
disease. More specifically, the present invention
relates to an enteral composition specifically designed
for patients with hepatic disease.The liver, and its proper functioning, is of utmost
importance to the survival of a patient. Because it is
responsible for the metabolism of nearly all nutrients,
and is the primary site for the inactivation of numerous
toxins, the liver is one of the most important organs of
the body. For example, the liver accounts for
approximately 20% of the body's basal metabolism.The liver extracts a majority of the amino acids,
carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, and minerals from portal
circulation. These nutrients, extracted by the liver,
are used as substrates or cofactors in all metabolic
processes carried out in the liver. Synthesis of plasma
proteins and bile secretion are additionally important
processes carried out by the liver.Due to a variety of insults and pathogens, the liver
can become diseased. Liver disease is a broad
classification encompassing a number of acute and chronic
diseases. These diseases include: hepatitis (viral and
non-viral); cirrhosis (alcoholic and non-alcoholic); and
liver failure. Liver failure is perhaps the most severe
disease and may be accompanied by a complex set of
conditions including: hepatic encephalopathy; 
hemorrhage; coagulapathy; ascites; jaundice; and
hepatorenal syndrome.Although many medical treatments have been devised
for treating liver disease, due to the paradoxical
relationship between hepatic function and metabolism,
medical treatment of the liver disease is complex and
difficult. Most, if not all, liver diseases require or
benefit from nutritional management. Those diseases
which are believed to benefit most from nutritional
management, include alcoholic and non-alcoholic
cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice, and in some situations
acute liver failure. The goals of such nutritional
therapies vary depending on disease and patient. The
goals can be either restorative or supportive.Liver disease can affect both hepatic cellular
function and structure. In chronic conditions such as
alcoholic cirrhosis, exposure to a toxicant promotes
inflammation of the periportal areas of the liver. As
a result, fibrosis develops and when sufficiently
advanced, canaliculi become blocked. As a result of
inadequate regional perfusion, hepatocyte degeneration
occurs.In an attempt to restore adequate circulation,
portal hypertension develops. Portosystemic
