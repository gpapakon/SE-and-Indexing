<ABSTRACT>
A security shade for the cargo area of a motor 
vehicle. The security shade includes a flexible shade panel 

(120) mounted to a roller tube (112) having at least one 
support subassembly (140) mounted to its ends. The 

subassembly further includes a housing (142) and a coupling 
portion which couples the housing to the roller tube, a 

rotational biasing spring (15) which rotationally biases the 
coupling portion relative to said housing and a mechanism 

for mounting the security shade within the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a roller type shade and, more particularly, to a
security shade adapted for use in a motor vehicle to obstruct the view into an interior
compartment area of the vehicle by covering the compartment area.In many styles of motor vehicles, a rear compartment or cargo area is provided for
storing cargo or personal items. Previously, any articles in the cargo area could be easily
viewed from the exterior of the vehicle. To discourage would be thieves, motor vehicle
manufacturers now typically provide a retractable security shade or panel that can be
extended to cover the cargo area and prevent anyone outside of the vehicle from readily
viewing any stored articles.Typically, security shades are comprised of a roller tube and flexible fabric panel,
which is wrapped onto the roller tube, mounted to a support structure in the vehicle. The
roller tube is rotationally biased so that the panel can be extended to cover the compartment
area and retracted onto the roller tube for storage when not in use. The free edge of the
shade panel is normally provided with a pull tube or stiffener having a handle that enables
the panel to be conveniently extended. The pull tube also includes clips or tabs, typically on
its ends, which engage brackets mounted to the vehicle sidewalls in the cargo area and
maintain the panel in its extended position.For many vehicles, the security shades are mounted so that the roller tube is
positioned across one end of the cargo area with the shade panel being extendable rearward
toward the vehicle's rear cargo door. Often the security shade is positioned behind a rear
seat back which can be folded down to enlarge the cargo area of the vehicle. When the
cargo area is enlarged, the security shade needs to be removed to prevent it from obstructing
and limiting full use of the cargo area. For this reason, security shades often feature a
mounting system which allows them to be easily removed from and reinstalled into the 
vehicle. This requirement involves incorporating a number of
individual components into the security shade and adds to the
overall cost and complexity of the unit.The complexity of conventional security shades is derived
from the high number of components which must be incorporated
into the ends of the security shade to provide for, not only
the removable mounting of the security shade system, but also
the rotational biasing of the roller tube. In production these
numerous components must be individually assembled together
which is both cumbersome

<CLAIMS>
A security shade support subassembly (140;240;340;440;540)
for a security shade (110;210;310;410;510) having a roller tube

(112;212;312;412;512) onto which is mounted a flexible panel
that can be deployed in a cargo area of a motor vehicle to

obstruct the view into the cargo area, said support subassembly
comprising:


a housing (142;242;342;442;542);
an outboard end wall (144;244;344;444;544);
an inboard end wall (164;264;364;464;564);
a skirt (146;246;346;446;546) extending generally between
said outboard end wall and said inboard end wall and co-operating

therewith to define a receiving cavity
(148;248;348;448;548);
rotational biasing means (150;250;350;450;550) for
inducing rotation of said roller tube and causing said shade

panel to be wrapped onto said roller tube in a stored position;
and
mounting means (180;280;380;480;580) for mounting said
security shade within the motor vehicle such that said shade

panel can be deployed to obstruct the view into the cargo area
of the motor vehicle,

characterised in that said support subassembly further
comprises:
a coupler (158;258,274;358,363;458;558,574) supported by
said housing and adapted to couple said subassembly to said

roller tube such that said receiving cavity is outboard
relative to said roller tube, said coupler being supported for 

relative rotation with respect to said housing, said rotational
biasing means being secured to said housing and to said coupler

and being disposed within said receiving cavity for
rotationally biasing said coupler; and
retention means (168;286;386;486;586) for maintaining said
subassembly in an assembled condition prior to said subassembly

being mounted to said roller tube.
A subassembly as set forth in claim 1, wherein said
biasing means is a motor torsion spring (150;250;350;450;550).
A subassembly as set forth in claim 2, wherein said motor
spring is a coil spring formed of a flat strip wrapped in a

planar spiral configuration.
A subassembly as set forth in claim 1, wherein said
basing means is a torsion spring (150;250;250;450;550) having

a fixed end (154;254;354;454;554) which is secured to a portion
of said housing so as to be non-movable with respect thereto,

and a movable end (156;256;356;456;556) being secured to a
portion of said coupler and being generally movable with

respect to said housing.
A subassembly as set forth in any one of the preceding
claims, wherein said housing includes portions at least

partially defining said receiving cavity.
A subassembly as set forth in claim 5, wherein said
outboard wall, said inboard wall and said skirt are a portion 

of said housing and co-operate to define said receiving cavity.

coupler.
A subassembly as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein said skirt (146;346;546) is generally immovable in

rotation and forms a portion of said housing.
A subassembly as set forth in any one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein said outboard wall is movable in rotation and forms a
