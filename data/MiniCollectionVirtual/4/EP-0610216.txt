<ABSTRACT>
A pacemaker capable of automatically adjusting the sensitivity of its sense amplifier to electrical cardiac signals is disclosed. In one embodiment, a pacemaker having a pressure sensor disposed on the distal end of its pacing/sensing lead counts the number of pressure events and electrical events which occur during an autosensitivity timing period. If the number of electrical events exceeds the number of pressure events by more than a predetermined margin, the sense amplifier's sensitivity threshold is decreased. If the number of electrical events does not exceed the number of pressure events by more than the predetermined margin, the sense amplifier's sensitivity threshold is increased. In another embodiment, the pacemaker maintains a running average of the peak voltages of sensed electrical events over a predetermined history period. Periodically, the pacemaker computes the ratio of the running average of peak voltages to a preprogrammed sense margin value, and adjusts the sensitivity threshold of the sense amplifier according to this computation. By basing the adjustment of the sense amplifier's sensitivity threshold on a long-term average of peak sense values, the effects of cycle-to-cycle variation in sensed values are minimized. In still another embodiment of the invention, a pressure sensor alone is employed to detect natural cardiac events.

<DESCRIPTION>
 AUTOMATIC SENSITIVITY ADJUST FOR CARDIAC PACEMAKERSFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to the field of cardiac pacemakers, and more particularly relates to the sensing of cardiac signals.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A wide variety of cardiac pacemakers are known and commercially available. Pacemakers are generally characterized by which chambers of the heart they are capable of sensing, the chambers to which they deliver pacing stimuli, and their responses, if any, to sensed intrinsic electrical cardiac activity. Some pacemakers deliver pacing stimuli at fixed, regular intervals without regard to naturally occurring cardiac activity. More commonly, however, pacemakers sense electrical cardiac activity in one or both of the chambers of the heart, and inhibit or trigger delivery of pacing stimuli to the heart based on the occurrence and recognition of sensed intrinsic electrical events. A so-called "Wl" pacemaker, for example, senses electrical cardiac activity in the ventricl of the patient's heart, and delivers pacing stimuli to the ventricle only in the absence of electrical signals indicative of natural ventricular contractions. A "DDD" pacemaker, on the other hand, senses electrical signals in both the atrium and ventricle of the patient's heart, and delivers atrial pacing stimuli in the absence of signals indicative of natural atrial contractions, and ventricular pacing stimuli in the absence of signals indicative of natural ventricular contractions. The delivery of each pacing stimulus by a DDD pacemaker is synchronized with prior sensed or paced events.Pacemakers are also known which respond to other types of physiologically-based signals, such as signals from 

 sensors for measuring the pressure inside the patient's ventricle or or measuring the level of the patient*s physical activity.In any pacemaker which delivers stimulating pulses in response to the presence or absence of natural electrical cardiac activity, the sensitivity of the pacemaker to natural cardiac signals is of critical importance. A pacemaker's sense amplifier circuitry must be sensitive enough to ensure detection of cardiac signals, which are typically of relatively low-magnitude (on the order of one to ten millivolts or so) , especially in the case of atrial sensing. A pacemaker having sense amplifier circuitry tha is not sensitive enough might lose synchronization with natural cardiac rhythm, or deliver pacing stimuli at inappropriate times, if all cardiac events are not sensed. This phenomenon is known
