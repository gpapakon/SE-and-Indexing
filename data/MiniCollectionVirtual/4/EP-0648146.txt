<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for removing carbon dioxide regeneratively from a hot gas stream, containing flue gases or fuel gases, wherein the gas stream is successively: a) used for heating (1) and/or desorbing (2) a solid absorbent loaded with carbon dioxide; b) optionally used for generating energy (12); c) passed through an absorber (3) in which carbon dioxide from the gas stream is absorbed on the absorbent, and: d) is discharged (11); and wherein: e) the absorbent from step c) is desorbed in a desorber (2) at least partially and optionally under elevated pressure and is then returned to step c). A system for carrying out said process is also described. The process and the system are suitable for removing carbon dioxide from combustion gases and for shifting (coal) gasification gases towards hydrogen.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Process for removing carbon dioxide regenerativelv from gas streamsThe invention relates to a process for removing carbon dioxide from hot gas streams. The production of carbon dioxide in energy generation processes is becoming more and more of a problem worldwide. The increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere results in reduced heat radiation from the Earth, which causes the temperature on Earth to rise and a number of life-determining processes to be perturbed. A solution for this problem can be sought in limiting the consumption of energy and, in addition, in forms of energy generation which do not yield carbon dioxide, such as combustion of hydrogen, nuclear energy and solar energy. The effect of solutions of this type is limited, certainly in the short and medium term, so that it is, at most, a question of reduced increase of the production of carbon dioxide.When fossil fuels are gasified, the main products are hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the most desirable component of the two being hydrogen. The shift from carbon monoxide to hydrogen can be effected, for example, by treatment with water (steam). This again produces carbon dioxide which causes the problems outlined above.Methods for removing carbon dioxide from gas streams do exist, but they have the drawback that they result in a considerable decrease(approximately 10%) of the efficiency of the energy generation (seeK. Blok and CA. Hendriks, "Voorstellen voor de integrerende studie ter afsluiting van het SOP C02" [Proposals for the Integrating Study at the close of the Coherent Research Package C02], State University ofUtrecht, December 199 ; Techniques for Absorption or Fixing of C02,Technieuws Tokyo, volume 29 (1). May 1991. publication of the DutchMinistry of Economic Affairs. Japanese Patent Application 51~**090 discloses a process for removing water and C02 from hot gases, in particular in the manufacture of steel, by treating the gases with CaO and/or MgO. The used oxide can be regenerated, according to this process, by hot a r being passed through. In US-A-3, 16,808 a process is described for regenerating calcium oxide which has been used for removing C02. According to DutchPatent Application 82.02061 (= GB-A-2,103.645) , C02 and H2S can be removed in a wet process from gases such as hydrocarbons by treatment 

with a solution of a tertiary amine and a physical absorbent. Japanese Patent Application 61-146344 discloses a process wherein C02 and water are removed from inert gases by utilising a zeolite bed which is
