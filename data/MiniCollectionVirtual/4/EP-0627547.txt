<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cylinder head in which that area (5) of one or more inlet and exhaust ports (3) close to the orifice is formed by an insert (6''), which extends coaxially with the inlet and exhaust valve (7). That area (5) of the inlet and exhaust port (3) close to the orifice can thereby be manufactured very accurately but nevertheless cost-effectively, for example by sintering of the insert (6''). The insert (6'') also forms the valve guide (12'). The valve spring (20) is supported on the insert (6''). It is thereby possible to preassemble a valve module, comprising the inlet and exhaust valve (7), the valve spring (20), the spring plate (21), the spring plate keys (22), the valve stem seal and also, where appropriate, the valve seat ring (17), outside the cylinder head. In addition to a precise port geometry, this results in the further advantage of a reduction in the cost of assembling the cylinder head.

<CLAIMS>
Cylinder head for a valve-controlled internal combustion 
engine, in which at least one of the gas exchange channels 

(3) in the region near the opening is formed by an insert 
(6) which is located in the cylinder head and extends with 

its longitudinal axis in a plane parallel to or in register 
with the longitudinal axis of the gas exchange valve or 

valves (7) and which is located in a corresponding bore of 
the body (1) of the cylinder head, and the region (5) of 

this gas exchange channel (3) near the opening enters the 
insert (6) laterally and emerges at its end face (9) 

directed towards the combustion chamber (8), wherein the 
head of the gas exchange valve (7) is arranged centrally to 

this outlet opening, the insert (6) above the region (5) of 
the gas exchange channel (3) extending in it and near the 

opening forms a valve guide (12) and is supported on a 
peripheral step (19) of the bore in the body (1) of the 

cylinder head, characterised in that the insert (6) with 
its upper end face (18) directly carries the valve spring 

(20). 
Cylinder head according to claim 1, characterised in 
that in an insert extend several regions of gas exchange 

channels arranged in a row, which regions are near the 
opening.
