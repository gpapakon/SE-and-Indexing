Multichip modules which can be surface-mounted on 
printed circuit boards, having electronic components 

fixed on a thin-film or thick-film substrate and having 
terminal elements with SMD capability, characterized in 

that the thin-film or thick-film substrate is a ceramic 
substrate (13), in that the ceramic substrate (13) is 

fastened by means of a flexible adhesive (2) on the top 
side of a printed circuit board (12), which belongs to 

the module and has circuit structures, and makes contact 
with the circuit structures by means of bonding connections 

(11), and in that the terminal elements are formed 
by approximately spherical solder agglomerations (10), 

which are provided on the rear side of the printed 
circuit board (12) and are connected to the circuit 

structures on the top side of the printed circuit board 
(12) via plated-through holes. 
Module according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the circuit structures have conductive track and 

resistor layers which are structured in an at least 
single-layer manner, and in that, in addition to the 

ceramic substrate (13), at least one further, discrete 
component (4, 5) is fixed on them and connected. 
Module according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the module is covered on essentially its entire 

top side by a protective cap (1) in such a way that it 
can be processed in an automated manner. 
Module according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the protective cap (1) is formed by a ceramic or 

plastic cap which is adhesively bonded onto the top side 
of the module.  

 
Module according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the protective cap (1) is formed by a reinforcing 

frame, which, in particular, is in the form of a lattice 
and is filled, in particular, with soft gel potting, and 

by a snap-on cover provided on the said frame. 
Module according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that at least one of the components (4, 5, 6, 

8) arranged on the ceramic substrate (13) or on the 
printed circuit board (12) is provided individually with 

an epoxy resin covering (14) or a plastic or metal cap. 
Module according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the solder agglomerations (10) are 

composed of reflowable tin solder material. 
Module according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the solder agglomerations (10) are 

provided over the whole area, in a grid pattern, on the 
rear side of the printed circuit board (12). 
Module according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that at least single-layer circuit structures 

are applied to the ceramic substrate (13), the components 
(6, 8) fixed on the substrate (13) making contact with 

the said circuit structures by means of bonding connections 
(3) or using flip-chip technology.
