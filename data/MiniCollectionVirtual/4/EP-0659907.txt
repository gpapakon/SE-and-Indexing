<ABSTRACT>
A pipe coil (16) is heated in the furnace (2) of a heat treatment 
apparatus (1). The oil adhered to the inside of the pipe is vaporized by 

this heating. In this state the oil removing gas is fed at one end into 
the pipe which gas is in the high temperature enough to maintain the 

vaporizing condition of the oil. The vaporized oil within the pipe is 
discharged by the feeding of the gas at the other end of the pipe while 

the oil is in the vaporized state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oil removing apparatus for cleaning the inside of a pipe
coil according to the preamble of claim 1.FR-A-2 308 436 describes a method to remove oil from a pipe coil. The pipe coil is
heated to about 500 Â°C and the vaporized oil is removed. The connecting device between
the supply means of purging gas and the pipe coil is made of refractory steel.JP-A-01 165 723 describes an oil removing apparatus for a pipe coil wherein a pipe coil
is positioned in a furnace and a purging gas is supplied via a communicating means to one
end of the pipe. A selected-location locking apparatus is provided for securely stopping the
tray on which the pipe coil is placed at the selected location so that a tight connection can
be established by a push-pull rod which can approach and move away from the pipe coil
within the furnace.JP-A-05 057 263 describes an oil removing apparatus according to the preamble of
claim 1. By supply of a high temperature oil discharging gas which is produced in a surge
tank a rapid vaporization and purging out of oil vapors can be obtained.It is an object of the present invention to provide an oil removing apparatus according to 
the preamble of claim 1 having a communicating means for communicating one end of a
gas supply passage and one end of the pipe of a pipe coil which is adapted for easy mutual
connection in a tight manner even when the pipe coils are positioned on slightly different
locations.The invention is characterized by the features of claim 1 and by the features of the
subclaims.Fig. 1is a schematic sectional view of a continuous prior art annealing furnace.Fig. 2is a vertical sectional view of the heating chamber of said furnace.Fig. 3is a drawing of a further prior art embodiment having a different type of the
furnace.Fig. 4is a drawing of an embodiment according to the invention.Fig. 5is a plan view, partly in cross section, showing a supply port member and a
universal joint means.Fig. 6is a sectional view taken on line VI - VI of Fig. 5.Fig. 7is a vertical sectional view of a pipe connecting device that can be used in the invention in the state that an
objective pipe is connected.Fig. 8is a plan view of a pipe connecting device that can be used in the invention in the state that an objective pipe is
connected. FIG.9is a vertical sectional view of a pipe connecting
device that can be used in the invention in the state that an objective pipe is not connected.Referring to FIG.1, the numeral 1 designates a heat
treatment apparatus of a pipe coil 16,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An oil removing apparatus for cleaning the inside of a pipe coil (16f),
comprising


a furnace (2f) providing a space for accommodating said pipe coil (16f) and a
heat source for heating said pipe coil (16f),
a gas supply means (47) for supplying gas to purge the oil vapor within a pipe
of said pipe coil (16f),
a gas supply passage (48, 45, 46) for introducing the gas supplied from said
gas supply means (47) into said furnace (2f), and
a communicating means (43) connected to a push-pull rod (21f) which can
approach and move away from the pipe coil (16f) within the furnace (2f) for communicating

one end of said gas supply passage (48, 45, 46) and one end (16af) of the pipe of
said pipe coil (16f) in said furnace (2f), characterized in that
said communicating means (43) is connected through an universal joint (44) to
said push-pull rod (21f).
An oil removing apparatus as set forth in claim 1 wherein part of said gas
supply passage (46) is provided within the furnace (2f) so as to heat the gas flowing from

said gas supply means (47) to said communicating means (43).
An oil removing apparatus as set forth in claim 1 or 2 wherein the pipe of
the pipe coil (16f) is provided with an intake port member at the one end (16af), the front

surface of which is formed flat and provided with an opening (37af) communicating with
said pipe while the surface of said communicating means (43) opposed to said front surface

of said intake port member is provided with an extruded abutting member (64) surrounding
an opening (62) for feeding the gas. 
An oil removing apparatus as set forth in claim 3 wherein the front view of
said abutting member (64) is a lateral ellipse.
An oil removing apparatus as set forth in any of claims 1 to 4, comprising
a further communicating means (52) for communicating with the other end (16b) of said

pipe coil (16f), and an exhaust passage (55, 54) communicating with said further communicating
means so as to guide the vaporized oil discharged from said pipe coil (16f) out of

the furnace (2f).
An oil removing apparatus as set forth in claim 5 wherein said further
communicating means (52) is connected through a further universal joint (53) to a further

push-pull rod (51) which can approach and move away from the pipe coil (16f) within the
furnace (2f).
