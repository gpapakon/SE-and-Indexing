<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for producing a 
monoalkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon compound (e.g. 

5-(o-tolyl)-2-pentene) which comprises the steps of 
alkenylating a side chain of an aromatic hydrocarbon 

compound having at least one hydrogen atom bonded to 
α-position of the side chain (e.g. alkylbenzene) by the 

use of a conjugated diene having 4 to 5 carbon atoms (e.g. 
1-3 butadiene) in the presence of an alkali metal-based 

catalyst supported on a carrier; removing at least part of 
the catalyst from the resultant reaction product by 

separating the same; inactivating and optionally removing 
the catalyst contained in the reaction product; and 

thereafter distilling the reaction product in liquid form 
to separate and recover the objective monoalkenyl aromatic 

hydrocarbon compound. By virtue of using the above 
specific method, the process can prevent the change in 

quality and property of the objective product even during 
atmospheric distillation, produce the objective product 

with high purity in high recovery rate and operate a 
distillation column during a long stable period of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a monoalkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon compound.
More particularly, it pertains to a process for producing
a monoalkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon compound by
alkenylating a side chain of an aromatic hydrocarbon
compound having at least one hydrogen atom bonded to
α-position of the side chain by using a conjugated diene
having 4 or 5 carbon atoms in the presence of an alkali
metal-based catalyst, and separating the objective
monoalkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon compound in the reaction
product to recover the same with high purity in a high
recovery rate.As a catalyst for producing a monoalkenyl aromatic
hydrocarbon compound by alkenylating a side chain of an
aromatic hydrocarbon compound by using a conjugated diene
having 4 or 5 carbon atoms, there is known a catalyst
comprising an alkali metal such as sodium and potassium or
an alloy thereof.It is known that in the case where the objective
monoalkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon compound is recovered by
separation from the reaction product in liquid form 
obtained by the use of such a catalyst, an attempt to
separate and recover the objective monoalkenyl aromatic
hydrocarbon compound after the completion of the reaction
by allowing the reaction product to cool, separating the
liquid phase containing the objective product from the
catalyst through decantation or filtration, and distilling
the separated liquid phase results in failure to obtain
the objective monoalkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon compound
with high purity in high yield, since the objective
compound changes in quality and property during such
steps. In order to solve such a problem there are
proposed various methods for treating the reaction
mixture.There is proposed in Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open No. 4127/1976, a method in which the
concentration of the total amounts of alkali metals and
organic alkali metal compounds in the hydrocarbon compound
to be used as the starting raw material for distillation
is set to the range of 0.09 to 15 mg-atom expressed in
terms of alkali metal components per one (1) kg of the
hydrocarbon compound. In the above-mentioned method,
however, it does not follow that all the alkali metal
catalyst components are removed, but part of the
components is inevitably mixed in the liquid phase in the
form of a soluble alkyl compound or an alkenyl complex.
In the case of the reaction product being introduced as it
is into a distillation column in the method, it occurs 
that the monoalkenyl aromatic hydrocarbon compound further
