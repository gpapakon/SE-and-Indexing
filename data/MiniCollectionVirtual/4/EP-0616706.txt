<ABSTRACT>
Systems are often used nowadays, e.g. in the manufacturing field, which depend in a complex manner on many different control parameters. The present invention describes a process for optimising the parameters of such systems. The introduction of a neuronal network which learns the behaviour of the technical system optimises the control parameters by comparing the system results, the actual behaviour, is compared with the results of the model and hence new control parameters are produced which are then iteratively supplied to the system until there is no longer any difference between the desired reference behaviour of the system and its actual behaviour, or this difference lies beneath a predetermined level. The process of the invention can be important, for instance in its use to optimise travel trajectories described by robot arms.

Process for generating control parameters for a 
reference behaviour of a system having an actual behaviour 

depending on the control parameters, 

a) wherein in a first step a trainable component (ε 
system model) is taught the actual behaviour (
y
o
) of 
the system (system), 
b) wherein in a second step the difference between 
reference behaviour (
y
d
) and actual behaviour (
y
k
) of 
the system (system), as reference deviation (
e
k
), is 
determined as a function of the control parameters 

(
u
k
) and is supplied to at least one trainable component 
(system model) to which the actual behaviour of 

the system has been taught, and said component provides 
a correction value (Δ
) for the control parameters 
(
u
k
) corresponding to the reference deviation 
(
e
k
), 
c) wherein in a third step new control parameters (
u
k+1
) 
are determined with the aid of the correction value in 

such a way that they bring about an improvement of the 
actual behaviour (
y
k
) with respect to the reference 
behaviour (
y
d
) of the system, and 
d) wherein at least the steps 2 and 3 are performed until 
the difference between reference behaviour and actual 

behaviour of the system (
e
k
) falls below a predetermined 
value. 
Process according to Claim 1, wherein the trainable 
component (system model) is a neural network which 

is taught, in that, for simulating the actual behaviour 
(
y
o
), at least one control parameter (in) is weighted at  
 

at least one neuron (ε). 
Process according to Claim 2, wherein the neural 
network (system model) learns linear behaviour of a 

system. 
Process according to Claim 2, wherein the neural 
network (system model) learns nonlinear behaviour of a 

system in that the control parameters supplied for 
training the system are coded. 
Process according to Claim 2, wherein a transformer 
assigns to at least one neuron a subset of the 

control parameters known from the actual behaviour for 
learning the system behaviour. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
wherein the system has at least minimum-phase behaviour, 

wherein the trainable component (system model) is taught 
in such a way that it is capable of determining the 

associated control parameters (
u
o
) from the actual behaviour 
of the system (
y
o
), and wherein a control parameter 
deviation (Δ 
) is determined from the reference deviation 
(
e
k
) which is combined with the control parameters 
(
u
k
) that brought about said reference deviation (
e
k
). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
wherein two identically taught trainable components 

(system model) are used as models, wherein one model 
receives the same control parameter as the system (U
k-1
) 
and the other model receives modified (by Δ 
) control 
parameters, and a deviation (Δ 
) is obtained by comparing 
the actual behaviour of the two models brought about, 

which deviation corresponds to the modification of the 
control parameters on the second model, wherein the 

modification is adapted iteratively in such a way that 
the square of the sum of the reference deviation (
e
k
) 
brought about by the system and a linear combination of 

the deviation (Δ 
) brought about by the models becomes 
minimal, and the modification of the control parameters 

(Δ 
) found in this way is combined with the particular 
control parameters (
U
k
) that brought about the reference 
deviation (
e
k
) of the system.  
 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
wherein the system is a robot arm that guides a tool, and 

the control parameters (
u
k
) are coordinate specifications 
which are to be included in a trajectory along which the 

robot is to guide the tool, and wherein the actual 
behaviour of the system is described by the trajectory 

along which the robot arm actually guides the tool. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
wherein the system represents a heating system and the 

control parameters (
u
k
) specify a temperature profile 
with which the heated material is to be heated, and 

wherein the actual behaviour is described by the actual 
temperature waveform of the heated material. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
wherein the actual behaviour (
y
d
) of the system is determined 
by sensors.
