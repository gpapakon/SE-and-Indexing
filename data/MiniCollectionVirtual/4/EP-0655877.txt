<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a device for preventing a high voltage 
transformer T2 of a microwave oven from being overheated, 

which directly senses a temperature in a second coil L4 of 
the high voltage transformer T2 of the microwave o
ven and 
thereby supplies or cuts off power to the transformer T2 

according to the temperature. In the device, a thermostat 
TH is opened/closed according to the temperature of the 

second coil L4 of the transformer T2 so as to regulate 
power supply to the first coil L3 of the transformer T2, 

and accordingly the transformer T2 is prevented from 
overheated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
preventing a high voltage transformer of a microwave oven
from being overheated, which directly senses a temperature
in a second coil of the high voltage transformer of the
microwave oven and thereby supplies or cuts off power to
the transformer according to the temperature.A microwave oven is a cooker for heating food by a
high frequency electric field, which includes a heating
chamber and a machine chamber. In the microwave oven, a
magnetron and a high voltage transformer are disposed in
the machine chamber. The high voltage transformer applies
a high voltage to the magnetron to make the magnetron
generate ultra microwaves, and the magnetron irradiates
the ultra microwaves into the heating chamber so as to
activate molecular movements in the food put in the
heating chamber, so that the food is heated.In the meantime, the high voltage transformer has a
large quantity of coils which generate a large quantity of
heat when the transformer is operated. Accordingly, the
operation efficiency of the microwave oven is lowered and
components of the microwave oven can be damaged when the
machine chamber is overheated due to the heat generated 
from the coils. Further, there is a possibility of danger
that the microwave oven will catch a fire.Therefore, proper means for preventing a high voltage
transformer of a microwave oven from being overheated when
operated has been required, and particularly International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) regulates that the
temperature of the high voltage transformer of the
microwave oven should not be over 210 Celsius degree.FIG. 5 is a circuit diagram of a conventional device
for preventing the temperature in the machine chamber of a
microwave oven from being over-elevated as described
above. As shown, a high voltage transformer T1 has a first
coil L1 to which an alternating current voltage is
applied, and a second coil L2 at which a circuit including
a high voltage fuse F1, a high voltage condenser C1, a
high voltage diode D1, and a magnetron M1 is constructed.In the device for preventing machine chamber of a
microwave oven from being overheated as described above,
high voltage fuse F1 is cut off or high voltage diode D1
is shorted before high voltage fuse F1 is cut off, when an
overcurrent flows through the second circuit L2. When high
voltage diode D1 is shorted before high voltage fuse F1 is
cut off, a closed loop comprising second coil L2, high
voltage fuse F1, high voltage condenser C1, and high
voltage diode D1 is
