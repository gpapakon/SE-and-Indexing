<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel devices and methods 
for freezing drops of liquid reagent. In particular, it 
relates to devices and methods for freezing liquid reagents 
useful in the analysis of biological samples. In preparing reagents for convenient and efficient 
testing of clinical biological samples, it is frequently 
important to obtain dry chemical blends in uniform, discrete 
amounts. These reagents must be efficiently and economically 
prepared in small precisely measured quantities. Reagents 
comprising organic materials, however, tend to spoil or degrade 
on storage, thus creating quality control problems. Thus, 
reagents are typically provided in dried form to increase 
stability. This is preferably done by freezing and 
lyophilizing the aqueous solutions comprising the reagents to 
form reagent spheres. US-A-4 848 084 relates to a method and 
apparatus for the generation of frozen droplets. Liquid is fed 
under pressure through a nozzle which provides a continuous 
stream of liquid which breaks apart to form droplets. The 
cryogenic liquid in the freezing tank is agitated with an agitator. 
US-A-4 982 577 discloses an apparatus and 
method for freezing droplets of liquid product. The apparatus 
uses cryogenic liquid, which flows along a ramp or sluiceway to 
freeze the droplets. US-A-4 989 416 discloses an 
elongate tunnel which is inclined to the horizontal and which 
can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. Rotation of the 
tunnel carries the particles out of the liquid nitrogen 
contained therein. US-A-4 798 614 relates to a 
freezing apparatus using a rotary chamber which rotates about a  
 
horizontal axis. US-A-4 760 712 discloses a rotary 
chilling plate on which articles to be frozen are placed in 
brine. US-A-4 920 762 discloses a method and 
apparatus for producing cryogenic targets using a mold 
assembly. US-A-4 870 829 discloses a biological 
freezing apparatus containing a specimen holder which is 
lowered into a tank comprising a cryogenic liquid. 
US-A-4 595 226 relates to a gas sample collection device which 
includes a specular carousel having at least one reflective 
surface for holding a sample deposited thereon. US-A-4 256 576 relates to a process for 
the creation of crystal aggregates in one part of the tank by 
heat transfer from a fluid disposed in another part of the 
tank. Both parts are separated from each other by a flexible 
membrane. US-A-3 282 064 relates to cryogenic or 
refrigerant regeneration for use in closed cycle systems. 
US-A-2 845 472 relates to

<CLAIMS>
A cryogenic apparatus using an amount of a cryogenic liquid for freezing 
liquid reagent to spheres, said apparatus comprising 


means (22) for dispensing uniform, precisely measured drops 
of a liquid reagent (4); 
a rotatable carousel (36) having a vertical axis of rotation; 
a plurality of trays (58) disposed on an upper surface of 
the carousel (36) being positioned to receive reagent drops from the 

dispensing means (22); 
means (40, 42, 44, 46) for rotating the carousel (36) about 
the vertical axis, 
 
characterized in that each tray (58) is adapted to receive solely 

the amount of cryogenic liquid (34) for 
freezing a single drop of liquid reagent (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein each tray (58) 
comprises a plurality of removable separators (62). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the cryogenic 
liquid (34) is liquid nitrogen. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
liquid reagent (4) comprises a reagent useful for the analysis of blood. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4, further comprising 
means (16, 18) for degassing the liquid reagent (4). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the 
carousel (36) is disposed within an insulated tank (38).  

 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the 
means (22) for dispensing comprises a nozzle tip (24) through which the 

liquid is dispensed, a cowling (26) around the nozzle tip (24) and a gas 
port (28) for blowing gas along the nozzle tip (24) thereby preventing 

moisture condensation on the nozzle tip (24). 
Apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the gas is nitrogen. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the 
carousel (36) rotates at a speed selected such that the cryogenic liquid 

(34) has a smooth surface. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 9, further comprising 
means (44, 46) for coordinating the rotation of the carousel 

(36) with the dispensing of drops of liquid reagent (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 10, wherein the means (44, 
46) for coordinating the rotation of the carousel (36) comprises a photo 

sensor (46). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 11, wherein the 
trays (58) are designed to be used in a lyophilizer. 
Method for forming reagent spheres comprising the steps of 

disposing at least one tray (58) on the upper surface of a 
carousel (36) rotatable around a vertical rotation axis; 
dispensing a uniform, precisely measured drop of a liquid 
reagent (4) into the tray (58) containing at least one entity of cryogenic 

liquid (34), whereby the drop is frozen; 
separating the frozen drops from the cryogenic liquid; and 
lyophilizing the frozen drops, thereby forming the reagent 
spheres 
 
characterized in  

 

that the entities of cryogenic liquid (34) are separated from each other 
to avoid passage of a drop; and 
that after each dispensing step, the carousel (36) is submitted to a rotation 
step to avoid that a second drop is dispensed into the same entity 

of cryogenic liquid (34) that received the previous drop. 
Method according to claim 13, wherein the frozen drops remain 
in the tray (58) during the separating step, and the lyophilizing
