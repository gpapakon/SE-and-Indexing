<ABSTRACT>
The dental hygiene apparatus includes a body portion (12) from one end of which extends an elongated resonator arm (32). The arm (32) is mounted for oscillating action about a torsion pin (38), by means of an electromagnet (16) in the body acting in combination with two permanent magnets (34, 35) which are mounted on the rear end (31) of the resonator arm (32). On the forward end (44) of the resonator arm (32) is mounted a set of bristles (47). The arm (32) is driven such that the tips of the bristles operate within ranges of amplitude and frequency to produce a bristle tip velocity greater than 1.5 meters per second, producing a significant cleansing effect beyond the tips of the bristles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to dental hygiene
devices and more specifically concerns a power-driven
acoustic toothbrush having a selected range of bristle
tip velocities so as to produce high performance results.Conventional toothbrushes, including both manual and
power-driven embodiments, attempt to produce the desired
cleansing effect by scrubbing the surfaces of the teeth
to remove dental plaque. Flossing is typically
recommended in addition to brushing to reach those tooth
areas which cannot be reached by a brush.However, it is well-known that flossing is
inconvenient and difficult to perform. Consequently,
only about 15% of the population practice flossing
regularly. In addition, conventional brushing action,
particularly over an extended period of time, can result
in an undesirable wear on teeth surfaces.In order to improve on the bushing/flossing
combination, a number of different technical approaches
have been used, with varying success. A first category
or group of devices involves the water jet phenomenon.
Representative examples of patents in this group include
US-A-3,227,158 to Moret, and US-A-3,522,801 to Robinson. 
Typically, these devices use a pulsating, highly directed
stream of fluid to remove material from around the teeth.
However, these devices do have significant disadvantages,
including a requirement of relatively high water
pressure. Generally, these devices are not very
effective in removing plaque. In addition, bacteremia
sometimes results from use of these devices. Further,
a water jet device is powered by line voltage (not
batteries), and typically requires a significant amount
of shelf space.A second group of devices includes those in which
a brush is vibrated at an ultrasonic frequency rate to
product a cavitation effect which in turn results in the
desired cleansing. US-A-3,335,443 to Parisi and US-A-3,809,977
to Balamuth are examples of such devices. The
primary difficulty with such devices is the requirement
of providing energy through the bristles at ultrasonic
frequencies, which are substantially higher than the
resonant frequency of the bristles, resulting in very low
efficiency of energy transfer to the tips of the
applicator. Safety problems may also be significant with
such devices, due to the application of ultrasonic energy
to tissue.In still another group are devices which operate at
low sonic frequencies but which also allegedly produce 
a cavitation effect. US-A-3,535,726 and US-A-3,676,218,
both to Sawyer, are representative of this group. It is
