<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a book
binding apparatus according to the preamble of the
patent claim 1.In the past, when a plurality of sheets on
which images were formed are automatically glue-bound
to obtain a book, an on-line system wherein a
plurality of apparatuses required for performing such
jobs are interconnected has been used. For example,
the on-line system includes a reading and sheet
supplying apparatus comprising an original setting
portion for setting art original, an optical system
for scanning the original, and a sheet supplying
apparatus for containing a number of sheets and for
supplying the sheet; an image forming apparatus for
forming an image on the sheet supplied from the sheet 
supplying apparatus; a book binding apparatus for
bookbinding the sheets on which the images were
formed; and a sheet sorting and containing apparatus
for sorting and containing the bookbound or finished
sheet bundles or the sheets. These apparatuses are
interconnected in series.When the sheet bundle is bookbound in the
book binding apparatus, the sheet bundle aligned in
a sheet align tray is glue-bound by a gluing binder.
A bind tape used with the gluing binder is of hot
melt type. The bind tape is abutted against the
sheet bundle and is adhered to the sheet bundle by
melting glue by means of a heater. Further, the
sheets were contained in a single sheet align tray
and were aligned with each other by abutting the
sheets against an abutment member. The sheet bundle
and the bind tape abutted against the sheet bundle
were heated by a single tape heating apparatus.
Further, a single stacker was provided in an
apparatus for containing the finished sheet bundles.However, in the conventional book binding
apparatuses, it took a long time for melting the glue
on the bind tape after the bind tape is set in the
tape heating apparatus. Further, even when the
molten bind tape abutted against the sheet bundle was
heated, since the heat was absorbed by the sheet
bundle, the bind tape could not adhered to the sheet 
bundle sufficiently. That is to say, it took a long
time for heating the sheet bundle having the room
temperature up to the gluing temperature. Further,
the image forming apparatus of high speed type
wherein a distance between supplied sheets is
relatively short is used with the on-line system.
Accordingly, when the single sheet align tray is
used, since the sheets are successively supplied
while the sheets in the tray are being aligned, the
productivity of the system is worsened. In addition,
as mentioned
