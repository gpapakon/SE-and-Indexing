<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus, connectable to a driving machine with an articulated boom system, which is operated by percussion energy and drives into or draws up from the ground piles or walls and grasps with its grippings jaws objects (17) on the ground or objects that are to be driven into the ground characterized in that the apparatus comprises a turning equipment system that transmits percussion energy to said object in order to grip with its jaws (16) the said object both with a firm hold of the jaws in the blow direction and an essentially vertical grip of the jaws and that the apparatus transmits the percussion force to the said object in line with its travel direction when both grips with the jaws are used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus, connectable to a
driving machine or a crane with an articulated boom system,
which generates impact energy, and a method to drive into or
draw up from the ground piles or similar objects. More particularly,
the invention relates to an apparatus according to the precharacterising
part of claim 1 and a method according to the precharacterising part of claim 4.Previously known are percussive pile drivers, connectable to
cranes and driving machines, which generate the percussion and
transmit it to the pile end. Especially, on driving special
piles, such as wall constructions and, particularly, if they
are also drawn up from the ground, the apparatus must be
furnished with firm gripping jaws in order to grab the pile
end and draw up the piles. Likewise, the gripping jaws are
useful for lifting the piles into their place. Further, the
rotative function of jaws in pile drivers is also known, by
means of which plate formed profiles can be turned with the
apparatus to a wanted position before starting to drive them
into the ground. Also known, see EP-A-0496167, is the turning of a vertical pile
driver to horizontal position in order to grab a horizontal
pile with the gripping jaws and lift it up to vertical
position or drive the pile horizontally.The disadvantage of the above presented drivers is the fact
that they only can grip the pile end and transmit the percussions
this way to the pile. Especially, when the apparatus
is connected to a machine, e.g. an excavator, fitted with a
boom system, very long piles cannot be handled, because the
upward reach of the boom system sets limits on the pile that
is being handled. The known solutions allow, indeed, gripping
the pile from the side, but they do not allow driving with
this grip, because the pile driver and the jaws in the known
constructions are of one and the same element and therefore
the percussions would drive the pile cross-wise and not in the
pile direction. According to the solution of this invention these disadvantages
are avoided and the invention is characterized in what is
presented in the patent claims.It can be considered the most important advantage of this
invention that with the apparatus quite long piles or wall
profiles can be driven into or drawn up from the ground
without any limitations by the upward reach of the excavator.
Further, the side grip also allows driving piles, the upper
end of which is by construction or for some other reason of
such kind that the percussion cannot be transmitted over it

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus, connectable to a driving machine or crane
with an articulated boom system, which is operated by percussive

force and which drives into or draws up from the
ground piles or walls and grasps with gripping jaws objects

(17) on the ground or objects to be driven into the ground,
which apparatus comprises a driving motor (7), a turning

equipment that transmits the percussion force and by which
equipment the gripping jaws can be turned about a horizontal

axis (10) from a vertical position or end grip position to a
horizontal position or side grip position, 
characterised
 in
that the apparatus has two spaced-apart pairs of gripping

jaws (16) to allow side grip on the object by using the two
pairs of gripping jaws, and in that a cylinder (5) connecting

the apparatus to the articulated boom system is furnished
with a valve (30) which can be opened to allow pressure fluid

on opposite sides of a piston in the cylinder (5) to flow
freely or almost freely into and out of the cylinder, thereby

allowing the piston to float in the cylinder (5).
An apparatus according to claim 1 characterized in that
for the end grip there is an additional pair of gripping jaws

(16').
An apparatus according to claim 1 characterized in that
the gripping jaws (16) comprise separate gripping surfaces

(25) which can be turned according to the gripping direction.
A method to drive into or draw up from the ground piles or
walls by means of an apparatus, connectable to a driving

machine or a crane with an articulated boom system, which is
operated by percussion force and which drives into or draws

up from the ground piles or walls and grasps with gripping jaws
objects (17) on the ground or objects to be driven into the

ground, said apparatus having a driving motor (7), a turning
equipment that transmits the percussion force and in which

method the gripping jaws can be turned about a horizontal 
axis (10) from a vertical position or end grip position to a

horizontal position or side grip position, characterized in
that the object is gripped with two pairs of spaced-apart

gripping jaws (16) and in that said apparatus is allowed,
during driving or drawing, to turn in relation to the driving

machine (19) by allowing, by means of a valve (30), pressure fluid on different sides of a
piston in a cylinder (5) connecting the apparatus to the

articulated boom system to flow freely or almost freely
into or out of the cylinder (5), thereby allowing the piston to

float in the cylinder (5).
