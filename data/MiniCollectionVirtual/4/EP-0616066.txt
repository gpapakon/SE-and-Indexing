<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a working method for giving a 
localized worn-out aspect to articles of clothing made of 

denim materials, which consists in treating the article of 
clothing (6, 70) fitted on a supporting manikin (2, 3) by 

means of the abrasive action of one or more rotating brushes 
(20, 21) contrasting against said article of clothing. 
The machine suited to carry out said working method comprises: 

one or more manikins (2, 3) supporting the article of 
clothing to be treated (6, 70), each consisting of a supple 

structure (4, 5) suited to be inflated through inflating 
means (7, 8, 14) so that it will adhere to the article of 

clothing (6, 70), so as to simulate the shape it will 
acquire once it is worn by a person; 
one or more rotating brushes (20, 21) attached to slides 
(24, 25) and sliding along rails (52, 53); 
a structure (10) for supporting and moving the manikins 
(2, 3) suited to bring the manikins into the area of action 

of the rotating brushes and to remove them from there after 
the treatment has been completed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a working method suited to give a 
worn out aspect to articles of clothing made of denim 
materials and a machine suited to carry out such a method. It is a known fact that the manufacturers of casual-fashion 
clothing made of denim materials in order to follow the 
trend of the market, treat the articles of clothing so as 
to give them a worn-out aspect. In order to give the article of clothing said worn-out 
aspect, a washing operation is performed during which the 
article of clothing is treated with proper enzymes or with 
pumice powder, thereby producing the discolouring of the 
cloth and the worn out aspect previously mentioned. Sometimes 
it is also required that said articles of clothing 
present a worn out aspect which is localized only over 
particular areas. This is obtained by concentrating in the 
concerned areas a particularly strong discolouring operation 
through supplementary treatments. One of the known methods used to perform such treatment 
consists in a very energetic manual brushing of the areas 
of the article of clothing where the discolouring is to be 
concentrated, thereby obtaining what in the technical 
jargon of this industrial sector is called "sanded effect". The inconveniences of such method of operation are rather 
obvious, the most evident being the length of time required 
by this operation and the ensuing high labour costs. Moreover, 
since this process must be performed manually, and 
depends exclusively on the operator's skill, it does not 
guarantee any continuity or reproduction of the same quality 
in the finished product. EP-A-0417659 discloses a process for artificially giving a 
worn and creased appearance to items of clothing, wherein 
the process comprises a step of temporary wrinkling of 
selected portions of the items followed by a step of spraying oxiding liquids.Another known method consists in performing manually a 
localized sanding process by blasting the article of 
clothing with a mixture of air and sand. This method presents 
the same inconveniences presented by the before-described  
 
method with the addition that it is also highly 
polluting both for the environment and for persons involved 
in the process, so that it requires suitably equipped 
spaces for it to be carried out. It is with the purpose of eliminating the mentioned inconveniences 
that the working method and the machine suited 
to carry it out, which are the object of the present invention 
are disclosed. One of the purposes of the invention is to give the

<CLAIMS>
A method for giving a localized worn-out aspect to clothing 
articles made of denim materials comprising the steps of: 


fitting said clothing articles (6, 70) on supporting manikins 
(2, 3) having a supple structure, 
inflating said supporting manikins with air to give them the 
shape as they are worn by a person; 
treating said clothing articles for giving them a localized worn-out 
aspect; 
removing said articles from the supporting manikin, 
 
characterized in that the treatment operation consists of worning-out 

the clothing articles (6, 70) by contrasting against localized 
points of them one or more rotating brushes (20, 21). 
A machine suited to carry out the method according to 
claim 1) comprising: 


a frame having one or more manikins with a supple structure, 
each supporting a clothing article; 
inflating means for inflating said manikins 
 
characterized in that the machine comprises rotating brushes, that the structure (10) for supporting and moving 

the manikins (2, 3) is suited to arrange said manikins and the 
clothing articles into at least two positions, one of 

them being the treatment position, in correspondence with the area 
of action of the rotating brushes, the other position being suited 

for fitting the article of clothing on the manikin and removing it 
from the same, said position being removed from the area of operation 

of the rotating brushes; and in that it presents one or more 
rotating brushes (20, 21), each applied on a slide (24, 25) moving 

along a rail (52, 53), said slides being provided with displacing 
means (40, 41, 22, 23) suited to bring said brushes into contrast 

against or to move them away from the article of clothing to be 
treated, being provided kinematic units (48, 70, 30) driving the 

brushes (20, 21) into rotation, the slides (24, 25) along the 
rails (52, 53) and the displacement of the structure (10) supporting 

the manikins (2, 3).  
 
A machine according to claim 2, characterized in
