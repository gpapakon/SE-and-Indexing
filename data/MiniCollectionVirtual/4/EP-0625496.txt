<ABSTRACT>
A chloroformic acid alkyl ester is decomposed to a 
corresponding alkyl chloride by bringing a gas containing 

the chloroformic acid alkyl ester into contact with a 
catalyst comprising an activated carbon and/or an 

inorganic oxide, for example, alumina, silica-alumina, 
synthetic zeolite, natorolite, mordenite, silica, titania 

or zirconia, the chloroformic acid alkyl ester-containing 
gas being, for example, a reaction product mixture 

derived from a gas phase catalytic carbonylation reaction 
of carbon monoxide with at least a nitrous 
acid ester in 
the presence of a solid catalyst and a chlorine-containing 

substance, for example, hydrogen chloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
decomposing a chloroformic acid ester. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a method of decomposing a chloroformic acid 
alkyl ester into a corresponding alkyl chloride, which 
method is useful to refine various mixed gases containing 
a chloroformic acid alkyl ester in various concentrations 
by bringing the chloroformic acid alkyl ester-containing 
gas into contact with a specific catalyst and thereby 
converting the chloroformic acid alkyl ester to an alkyl 
chloride and removing the alkyl chloride from the mixed 
gas. The method of the present invention is 
applicable to a mixed gas produced from a gas phase 
catalytic carbonylation reaction of carbon monoxide with 
at least a nitrous acid ester in the presence of a solid 
catalyst and a chlorine compound, and containing, as a 
by-product, a chloroformic acid alkyl ester in addition 
to the resultant carbonylation product, for example, 
dialkyl carbonate or dialkyl succinate. The method of 
the present invention is contributory to preventing 
corrosion of a refining apparatus due to the chloroformic 
acid alkyl ester contained in the gas mixture. As a known method of decomposing a chloroformic 
acid ester, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 77, 5033 (1955) discloses 
a method of converting a chloroformic acid ester to an 
alkyl chloride by heating the chloroformic acid ester in 
the presence of a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride. 
This method is disadvantageous in that a long time is 
necessary for the decomposition of a lower alcohol ester 
of chloroformic acid and the resultant degree of  
 
decomposition is low. Also, German Unexamined Patent Publication 
(DE-OS) No. 2,545,659 discloses a method of producing an 
alkyl chloride by heating a chloroformic acid ester at a 
temperature of 120 to 130°C in an aprotic solvent, for 
example, N-methylpyrrolidone. This method is 
disadvantageous in that this is a liquid phase method in 
which a special solvent must be employed and a solvent 
vessel must be provided, and thus is not economical for 
industrially decomposing the chloroformic acid ester. U.S. Patent No. 4,260,810 and U.S. Patent 
No. 5,162,563 disclose that in catalytic carbonylationn 
reactions, for example, carbonic acid ester-synthesis 
reactions or dicarboxylic acid diester-synthesis 
reactions, of carbon monoxide with at least nitrous acid 
esters in a gas phase in the presence of a solid catalyst 
comprising a platinum group metal chloride carried on a 
carrier, the catalytic activity of
