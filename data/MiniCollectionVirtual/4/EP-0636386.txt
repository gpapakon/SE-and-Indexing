<ABSTRACT>
The device (1) for performing extracorporeal 
electrochemical therapy is constituted by a box-like 

container body (2) which internally forms a chamber, which 
can be divided by means of partitions into sub-chambers, in 

which a drug in the fluid, semi-fluid, gelatinous or solid 
state can be introduced. The drug can be ionically activated 

by means of a related electrode (7) which is also insertable 
into the chamber/sub-chambers. The upper face (2a) of the 

container body (2) is affected by a plurality of parallel 
grooves (5) delimiting elastic blocks which allow the 

inward/outward flexing of the upper face (2a). A perimetric 
border (6) is provided at the base of the body (2) in order 

to apply means for fixing to the patient's skin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable device 
for extracorporeal electrochemical therapy. Iontophoresis has long been used for the intracorporeal 
and extracorporeal curing of various diseases. Extracorporeal therapy is normally performed by using 
devices made of materials which imbibe a medicinal solution 
and subsequently slowly release it proximate to the region 
to be treated. The materials used, due to their very nature, do not 
allow thorough adhesion to the portion of skin surface to be 
treated. For example, spongy materials or hides of various 
kinds are placed on the skin and make contact with it in a 
microscopically incomplete manner, due to the significant 
percentage of empty spaces included in the fibers, which 
causes imperfect adhesion between the surfaces in mutual 
contact. This leads to a significant decrease in the 
effectiveness of the iontophoretic treatment, since the 
interchange surfaces for the drugs to be activated by low-voltage 
ion excitation are reduced. In order to solve this problem, the Applicants have 
already produced two devices for extracorporeal 
iontophoretic treatment, both of which are the subject of 
corresponding Italian patent applications, Nos. 40010 A/90 
and 40017 A/90. Each of said devices consists of a container 
shaped according to the region of the body to be treated and 
having a drug introduction inlet through which an ion 
excitation electrode can subsequently be inserted, and a 
region for exchange with the body of the patient. These devices satisfactorily solve the above described  
 
problems of the known art; however, they are susceptible to 
further improvements for facilitating their use and making 
them more versatile and advantageous. All known devices in fact require preliminary 
preparation of the drug or the medicinal solution, which is 
then introduced into the container body and is subsequently 
activated by inserting an electrode, as mentioned. This method of operation is highly onerous and thus 
uneconomical; furthermore, known devices cannot control the 
pH value of the drug, and this can burn the patient during 
long applications. The technical aim of the present invention is to solve 
the problems encountered in the use of the prior art devices 
by providing an improved device for extracorporeal 
electrochemical therapy which allows to operate rapidly and 
is also suitable to be packaged in a sterile and disposable 
solution and so that it is already internally provided with 
the dose of drug to be administered, and which

<CLAIMS>
Improved device for extracorporeal electrochemical 
therapy, of the type which is constituted by a box-like 

container body, characterized in that it comprises a chamber 
inside said body, which can be divided in a modular manner 

by means of partitions into sub-chambers, for containing 
drugs in a fluid, semi-fluid, gelatinous or solid state, 

said body having an upper face defining a series of parallel 
grooves arranged along at least two mutually intersecting 

axes and forming a plurality of blocks, said blocks being 
elastically movable with respect to one another for the 

inward/outward flexing of said upper face, a perimetric 
border extending from an opposite lower face of said body 

and protruding for the application thereon of means for 
fixing to the skin of a patient, said border surrounding an 

opening for access to the chamber/sub-chambers, at least one 
electrode for activating ions of a drug being insertable 

into said opening, access/venting holes being provided in 
the upper face of the container body and communicating with 

said chamber/sub-chambers. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said electrode is stiletto-shaped and can be provided with 

elements for the pointwise diffusion of the current. 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that 
said elements for the pointwise diffusion of the current are 

constituted by a plurality of points extending radially 
from a central main stem which constitutes said electrode. 
Device according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that said electrode has a laminar shape and 

 
can be inserted proximate to the top inside the container 

body. 
Device according to claims 1, 2, 3 or 4, 
characterized in that said electrode is made of 

electrochemically inert/active materials for use in 
correspondingly prolonged/short-lasting therapies to 

maintain a constant pH value. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
compress made of a material impregnated with a drug and can 

be penetrated by said electrode or is tangent thereto, can 
be inserted in said chamber/sub-chambers between the 

electrode and the skin of a patient. 
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that 
said impregnated material is constituted by 

organic/synthetic sponges which are electrically inert and 
highly hydrophilic on contact with drugs in the liquid 

and/or gelatinous state. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said access/venting holes have openings arranged in pairs, 

which mutually interfere and converge toward the inside of 
the container body, a needle of a filling syringe being 

insertable through a first hole, a second hole being 
provided for the slightly forced and tight insertion of said 

stiletto electrode, the body of which, after said insertion 
is completed, closes the first hole. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said box-like body is packaged in a presterilized and ready-for-use 

form. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said axes which mutually intersect so as to form the blocks 

 
are mutually perpendicular on the plane of arrangement of 

the upper face of the box-like body.
