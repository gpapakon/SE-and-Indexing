<ABSTRACT>
In a surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter (20), on a 36° 
Y-cut X-propagation lithium tantalate substrate (21), series 

branch SAW resonators (22a-22f), which are connected in series 
between an input terminal (24a) and an output terminal (24b), and 

parallel branch SAW resonators (23a-23c), which are connected 
between respective pairs of the series branch resonators 

by wirings and which are grounded, are provided. Two 
series branch resonators and one parallel branch resonator 

are connected in a T shape, so as to form a fundamental 
unit. In the SAW filter, three fundamental units are 

serially connected. An interdigital transducer (IDT) (2) 
included in each resonator is made of a metal film containing 

aluminum as the main component. The thickness of 
the metal film is in the range of 8% to 10% of the electrode 

pitch of the IDT of the parallel branch resonator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface acoustic
wave (SAW) filter for exciting a surface acoustic
wave on a substrate made of a piezoelectric material and
for selectively passing a desired frequency band. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a
ladder-type SAW filter suitably used as an RF filter in
mobile communication equipment.In recent years, SAW filters are increasingly in
demand with the miniaturization of mobile communication
equipment. The SAW filters are required to have superior
characteristics of large stop band rejection as well as
low loss. Among various types of SAW filters,
ladder-type SAW filters are promising ones because the
loss thereof can advantageously be made lower as compared
with interdigitated interdigital transducer structure
type SAW filters in which a plurality of input
interdigital transducers (IDTs) and output IDTs are
alternately disposed in a direction in which the surface
acoustic wave propagates.Conventional ladder-type SAW filters are described,
for example, in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 52-19044 or Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 5-183380 which corresponds to EP-A-541 284.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 52-19044 is directed to a ladder-type SAW filter for
realizing narrow-band filter characteristics of sufficiently 
narrow pass bandwidth and sufficiently large stop
band rejection. For this purpose, the ladder-type SAW
filter of the above publication has a construction in
which a series branch and a parallel branch, each having
an SAW resonator, are provided on a substrate made of a
piezoelectric material (hereinafter referred to as a
piezoelectric substrate). In addition, the ladder-type
SAW filter is constructed so that the resonance frequency
of the series branch resonator is made equal to the
antiresonance frequency of the parallel branch resonator,
so that an equal frequency is set to be the center frequency
of the pass band. The narrow-band filter characteristics
of sufficiently narrow pass bandwidth and
sufficiently large stop band rejection are realized by
setting the equivalent parallel capacitance of the parallel
branch resonator larger than the equivalent parallel
capacitance of the series branch resonator, and hence
making the ratio of equivalent parallel capacitance
larger than 1.In the above-described construction for realizing
the narrow-band filter, the stop band rejection can be
made larger by increasing the ratio of equivalent parallel
capacitance, while the bandwidth becomes narrower as
the ratio
