<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plastic lens which
is excellent in adhesiveness of coated films, scratch
resistance, impact resistance, resistance to chemicals,
weather resistance and reflection preventing property.In recent years, attention has been drawn to plastic
lenses as materials for eye-glasses since they have light
weights as compared with inorganic glasses, are excellent
in the impact resistance and are capable of being easily
dyed. For these reasons, various plastic lenses having
a high index of refraction and a low chromatic aberration
have been proposed.Generally, plastic lenses have a disadvantage in
that they are easily scratched and, therefore, a silicone
type hard coat film is usually provided on the surface
of the lenses. In some cases, lenses having a reflection
preventing film formed by vapor-deposition of an inorganic
substance for the purpose of preventing flicker and ghost
by reflection from the surface of the lens are put into
practical use.However, a plastic lens having provided thereon
a hard coat layer only and a plastic lens having provided
thereon both a hard coat and a reflection preventing film
have also a disadvantage in that they are inferior in the
impact resistance as compared with the plastic lens having
no such films, and a means for solving this problem has been
studied from the various viewpoints. For example, a plastic
lens having a primer layer between the lens base material
and the hard coat layer for the purpose of improving the
impact resistance has been proposed as described in Japanese
Patent Publication (Kokai) No. Sho 61-251801.However, since the above-proposed lens has a
relatively soft primer layer comprising an acryl-styrene
type emulsion resin, another problem has arisen in that
such a soft primer layer adversely affects the scratch
resistance of the hard coat layer itself and, thus, the 
lens is inferior in the scratch resistance as compared
with the plastic lens having no primer layer.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is
to provide a plastic lens which is excellent in the scratch
resistance even though it has a primer layer, and which is
excellent in the impact resistance even though it has a hard
coat film or a hard coat film and a reflection preventing
film.The above object of the present invention can
be achieved by a plastic lens which comprises a plastic
lens base material having provided on at least one surface
thereof a primer layer and a hard coat layer in this order
wherein said primer layer comprises a resin containing
at least
