<ABSTRACT>
Preparation of hydrogen methyl polysiloxanes with trimethylsilyl end group involves using at most 0.5 mols water per mol hydrolyzable chlorine in a first stage. The preparation of hydrogen methyl polysiloxanes with trimethylsilyl end groups comprises: (i) reacting methyl dichlorosilane and trimethyl chlorosilane with at most 0.5 mols water per mol hydrolyzable chlorine to give a partial hydrolyzate and gaseous hydrogen chloride; and (ii) treating with water to separate off the SiCl groups whilst forming HCl.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing hydromethylpolysiloxanes
having trimethylsilyl end groups, in which process in a

first step, methyldichlorosilane and trimethylchlorosilane
are reacted with at most 0.5 mol of water

per mole of hydrolysable chlorine to give a partial
hydrolysate and gaseous hydrogen chloride and

in a second step, the partial hydrolysate, to remove
the SiCl groups still present, is treated with water,

forming hydrochloric acid.
Process according to Claim 1, in which hydrochloric
acid formed in the second step is used as water

source in the first step.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the
methyldichlorosilane:trimethylchlorosilane weight ratio

is from 100:1 to 2:1.
Process according to Claim 1 to 3, in which
both steps are carried out fully continuously.
Process according to Claim 1 to 4, in which
high-volatility constituents are separated off

downstream of the first and/or second step and these
high-volatility constituents are reused in the first

and/or second step.
