<ABSTRACT>
A device is described for introducing gas into a liquid having a hollow star-shaped rotor (6) which is mounted so as to be able to rotate about a vertical axis and is arranged in the bottom region of a liquid vessel (1), the cavity of which rotor is connected at the end to a gas feed line (15) and which rotor is provided on the rear surfaces (11), with respect to its direction of rotation, of the star arms (10) with gas outlet orifices (12), having a liquid feed (17) to one of the two ends of the rotor (6) and having, surrounding the rotor (6), a stator (7) of flow ducts (9) for the gas/liquid mixture forming. In order to be able advantageously to circulate the vessel liquid by such a device even without gas introduction, it is proposed that in the spaces between the star arms (10) of the rotor (6), baffles (18) are provided to separate the gas stream (16), which exits from the gas outlet orifices (12), and the flow of the liquid feed (17).

A device for introducing gas into a liquid, 
comprising a hollow star-shaped rotor (6) mounted for 

rotation around a vertical axis and disposed in the 
base region of a liquid container (1), the rotor cavity 

being connected at its end to a gas pipe (15) and 
having gas outlet openings (12) on the rear flanks 

(11), relative to the direction of rotation, of the 
arms (10) of the star, the device also comprising an 

inlet (17) for liquid at one of the two end faces of 
the rotor (6) and a stator (7) surrounding the rotor 

(6) and comprising flow ducts (9) for the gas-liquid 
mixture being formed, characterised in that baffles 

(18) for separating the gas flow (16) leaving the 
openings (12) from the flow into the inlet (17) for 

liquid are provided in the wedge-like regions between 
the arms (10) of the star-shaped rotor (6). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the baffles (18), which adjoin the rear flanks 

(11) of the arms (10) in the region of the end face of 
the rotor (6) facing the inlet (17), are inclined in 

the peripheral direction towards the other end face of 

the rotor (6) and extend at least half way up the 
rotor. 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the outer edges (23) of the baffles (18) extend 

along an envelope cylinder around the rotor (6). 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the rotor (6) rotates at the same  

 
speed, whether the gas feed pipe (15) is open or 

closed. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the maximum speed of the rotor 

(6) is 600 rpm. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the flow ducts (9) in the stator 

(7) are prolonged by connected distribution pipes (19) 
which have upwardly directed distribution openings 

(20). 
A device according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the flow cross-section of the openings (20) widens 

along the distribution pipes (19) towards the outer end 
thereof. 
A device according to claim 6 or 7, characterised 
in that the openings (20) comprise longitudinal slots 

on the top surface of the distribution pipes (19).
