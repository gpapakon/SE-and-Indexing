<DESCRIPTION>
 THAWING FROZEN FOODThe present invention relates to the thawing of frozen materials, primarily frozen foodstuffs. General background:The use of deep-freezing to preserve foods is now widely established. The food to be preserved is frozen, to a temperature at which the fraction of the water content of the food remaining in liquid form is small. Temperatures in the region of -10°C to -30°C are typical - the fraction of the freezable water content of raw meat, for example, remaining liquid is typically in the region of 10% at -10°C, 5% at -20°C, and 3% at -30°C. At such temperatures, food can often be stored for long periods of time, of the order of months or even years, without major deterioration.The food may be frozen as large blocks, which may include many portions, or in smaller, even individual, pieces. Some relatively pure ice may be present around the food and/or between different portions.When such frozen food is to be used, it must of course be thawed. Some foods (such as some fruits) need only be brought to ambient temperatures; some (such as pre-cooked meals) need to be brought to a high temperature for eating; and some (such as meat and fish) need to be cooked, i.e. brought to a high temperature and held at that temperature for a substantial time.(It will be realized that by thawing we mean substantially complete conversion of the ice content to liquid form. This is distinct from procedures such as bringing the food up to a temperature at which it loses rigidity but still retains a significant fraction of its water content in the form of ice.) 

 Natural thawing:The simplest technique for thawing consists of merely leaving the frozen food at normal ambient temperature. This results in a thawing time which is both variable and long. The time is variable because it is dependent on the ambient temperature, which is dependent on a variety of factors (such as time of year); it is long because the rate of heat transfer into the interior of the frozen food is low, being dependent on the temperature gradient (which is low and decreasing as thawing proceeds) and the thermal conductivity of the food (which is also low).It will of course be realized that a large proportion of the heat required for thawing is absorbed in effecting the phase change (melting) of the water content of the food from ice to liquid water (the latent heat requirement). This melting- occurs gradually, over a temperature range, and is. generally . substantially complete by about -0.5βC. The temperature gradient from the surface of

CLAIMS
1. A method of thawing frozen food characterized by directing ultrasonic energy into frozen food subject to the conditions that
(a) the frequency is high enough that the energy is not attenuated excessively at the surface of the food, and
(b) the frequency is low enough that the energy is not attenuated excessively in the body of the thawed food, whereby the energy effecting the thawing results primarily from the absorption of the ultrasonic energy in the zone between any thawed portion and the substanti lly frozen portion, the thawing zone.
2. A method according to claim 1 characterized by the further condition that the cavitation threshold is increased.
3. A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the frequency is below 740 kHz.
4. A method according to claim 3 characterized in that the frequency is above 430 kHz. 5. A method according to claim 1 characterised in the further condition that the ultrasonic energy is pulsed.
6. A method according to claim 1 characterised in the further condition that the thawing is carried out at a static pressure elevated above ambient pressure. 7. A method according to Claim 6 characterised in that the static pressure is elevated up to 600 kPa above atmospheric pressure.
8. A method according to Claim 7 characterised in that the static pressure is elevated to at least 300 kPa above atmospheric pressure.
9. A method according to Claim 6 characterised in that the frequency is reduced when elevated pressure is applied.
10. A method according to any previous claim, characterised by means for determining the completion of thawing by detecting the passage of ultrasonic energy completely through the food. 


 11.A method according to any previous claim, characterized in that the food is subjected to a directed beam of ultrasonic energy.
12. A method according to any one or claims 1 to 10 characterized in that the food is subjected to two oppositely directed beams of ultrasonic energy.
13. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 10 characterized in that the food is subjected to a substantially random sea of ultrasonic energy. 14. A method according to either of claims 11 and 12 characterized in that the ultrasonic energy is applied to the food by means of direct contact with the at least one source of the ultrasonic energy.
15. A method according to either of claims 11 and 12, characterized in that the food is moved transversely through the at least one beam of ultrasonic energy.
16. A method according to any one of claims 11 to 13, characterized in that the ultrasonic energy is coupled to the food by means of aqueous liquid. 17. A method of thawing frozen food according to any of claims
1 to 16 characterized in that the food is contained in a conforming jacket.
18. A method according to claim 17 characterized in that the jacket is arranged to be evacuated at least initially. 19. A method according to Claim 17 characterized in that the evacuation of the jacket is continued during thawing.
20. Apparatus to thaw frozen food in accordance with the method in any of claims 1 to 19.
