<ABSTRACT>
Infrared illuminant compositions are disclosed which 
produce significant quantities of infrared radiation when 

burned but which produce very little visible light. The 
infrared illuminant compositions provide specific illumination 

in the spectral range visible with night vision devices. The 
disclosed infrared illuminant compositions include ammonium 

nitrate as the main oxidizer, an infrared generator such as 
cesium nitrate, rubidium nitrate, or mixtures thereof, and a 

fuel. By eliminating potassium and its direct and indirect 
visible light contributions, from the illuminant compositions, 

improved concealment indexes are obtained. Other additives, 
including conventional binders and burn rate modifiers may be 

used as to tailor the performance and physical characteristics 
of the infrared illuminant composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to infrared illuminant 
compositions. More particularly, the present invention is 
related to infrared illuminating compositions which produce 
specific illumination in the spectral region observed with 
infrared image intensifiers with minimal visible light production. Infrared illuminant flares are used to enhance the use of 
infrared image intensifiers such as night vision goggles. 
These flares are generally configured in much the same manner 
as visible light emitting flares. Thus, these flares may 
provide infrared radiation at a single position on the ground 
or they may be propelled over the area of interest and ignited 
to provide radiation above the ground. Generally, it is desirable 
that such flares radiate predominantly or almost exclusively 
in the infrared region and produce little or substantially 
no visible light. It will be appreciated that it is 
often desirable to conduct operations in a covert manner which 
avoids illuminating the observer and does not alert the target, 
or others, to the presence of the flare. Infrared illuminant compositions and flares have been 
developed but problems exist. Among the problems encountered 
is the presence of undesired visible light during burning. In 
that regard, the performance of infrared emitting devices can 
be judged by the ratio of infrared light to visible light 
observed during combustion. This ratio is known as the 
concealment, or covert, index. The concealment index is low 
for many conventional infrared emitting compositions, indicating 
a high proportion of visible light being emitted from the 
flare. The alkali metals potassium, cesium, and rubidium are 
known to generate infrared radiation upon burning. Nitrates of  
 
these metals produce low levels of visible light. Thus, known 
infrared illuminating compositions with good concealment 
indexes generally comprise one or more of these metal nitrates. 
Cesium and rubidium exhibit substantially similar properties 
and are considered generally interchangeable. Some problems 
encountered include the relative expense of cesium and rubidium 
compounds and the relatively slower burn rate and lesser 
infrared efficiency of potassium nitrate. The combination of 
cesium and potassium nitrate, however, yields cost-effective 
compositions with satisfactory burn rates, improved infrared 
efficiency, and low concealment indexes. Although compositions comprising a combination of cesium 
nitrate and potassium nitrate have low concealment indexes, the 
significant
