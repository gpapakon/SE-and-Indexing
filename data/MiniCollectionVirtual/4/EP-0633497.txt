<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to X-ray intensifying screens and
the use thereof in medical applications.In radiography the interior of objects is reproduced by means of
penetrating radiation, which is high energy radiation belonging to
the class of X-rays, γ-rays and high-energy elementary particle
radiation, e.g. β-rays, electron beam or neutron radiation. For the
conversion of penetrating radiation into visible light and/or
ultraviolet radiation luminescent substances, called phosphors, are
used.In a conventional radiographic system an X-ray radiograph is
obtained by X-rays transmitted imagewise through an object and
converted into light of corresponding intensity in a so-called
intensifying screen (X-ray conversion screen) wherein phosphor
particles absorb the transmitted X-rays and convert them into
visible light and/or ultraviolet radiation to which a photographic
film is more sensitive than to the direct impact of X-rays.In practice the light emitted imagewise by said screen
irradiates a contacting photographic silver halide emulsion layer
film which after exposure is developed to form therein a silver
image in conformity with the X-ray image.For use in common medical radiography the X-ray film comprises a
transparent film support double-side coated with a silver halide
emulsion layer. During the X-ray irradiation said film is arranged
in a cassette between two X-ray conversion screens each of them
making contact with its corresponding silver halide emulsion layer.For each diagnosis, the diagnostician needs an X-ray recording
system that presents a latitude (or contrast) appropriate to the
diagnosis at hand.When diagnosing bone lesions e.g. the diagnostician is almost
exclusively interested in the image of the bones and may disregard
more or less the surrounding soft tissue. This means that only an
image of the X-rays penetrating the bones has to be recorded. Since
the absorption of X-rays by bone is only changed by differences in 
thickness of the bones, the X-rays reaching the recording system
offer low contrast and a recording medium presenting high contrast
is desirable. When diagnosing on the other hand e.g. a thorax the
diagnostician not only wants to have a clear picture of the lung
fields, but also wants a clear picture of the lung fields that are
obscured by the heart and breast bone. The lungfields absorb far
less X-rays than the breast bone or the heart, and the X-rays
entering the recording system present a high contrast and a
recording medium with low contrast (or high latitude) is
