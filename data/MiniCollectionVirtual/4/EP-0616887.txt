<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a wiping (scraping) device for an intaglio printing machine. This device is characterised in that the means controlling the oscillating axial movement of the wiper (scraper) holder (5) include a hydraulic receiver (8) with two elements which can move which respect to one another under the action of a pressurised hydraulic fluid, one of these elements being integral with the moving wiper (scraper) holder (5), while the other element is kept stationary, and a means (7) for periodically initiating the application, to the hydraulic receiver (8), of the pressurised hydraulic fluid so as to give rise to a reciprocating movement of the moving element of the hydraulic receiver (8) and consequently of the wiper (scraper) holder (5).
