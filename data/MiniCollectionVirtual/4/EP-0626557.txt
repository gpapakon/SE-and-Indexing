<ABSTRACT>
An ammunition for practice or training which ruptures at impact. The 
bullet has a core made of sintered metal and a jacket or coating. 
Possible core material: iron, steel, tungsten, copper and bronze 
powders. The metal powder has particle size up to 200 microns, e.g. in 

the range of 20 to 150 micron. 
Possible metal jacket: copper, zinc, nickel alloy. 
Possible plastics jacket: polyamide, e.g. nylon 11; polycarbonate or 
polyester resin. The plastics coating has a thickness in the range of 

0,05 to 0,4mm, e.g. 0,08 to 0,15mm. 
Manufacturing method: the projectile is sintered at a temperature 

between 600째C and 800째C during to 1 to 5 hours; the projectile is heated 
to a temperature above the melting point of the plastics material and 

then placed in a fluidised bed containing plastics particles at room 
temperature; the plastics coating is reheated with infrared heating in 

order to have a smooth surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to projectiles and especially but not exclusively to frangible 
training projectiles for small arms up to about 12.7mm calibre. For training applications it is highly desirable to provide ammunition which is 
relatively safe in use but resembles the performance of standard ammunition as closely 
as possible in a standard weapon without the need for any modification. For maximum 
realism, the training round should be capable of normal operation of all automatic 
weapon functions such as single shot and automatic modes of fire and ejection, and 
should provide a realistic level of recoil. In addition the practice ammunition should 
have a projectile which can be fired at a target but should then rapidly lose energy so as 
to reduce the danger of ricochet or lethal fragments. According to one prior proposal, a practice round of ammunition has a case of 
plastics material with an integrally moulded projectile, but a special design of weapon is 
required to simulate automatic operation, including extraction and reloading functions. 
The user will experience a report, but the recoil force will be considerably less than with 
a standard system, and although a projectile can be fired at a target, its range is extremely 
limited. This system provides some basic practice in weapon handling but is relatively 
unrealistic. Efforts have mainly in the past been directed to ammunition based on more 
conventional designs, but having a projectile of a plastic matrix filled with metal 
particles. By this means a projectile having a reasonably high density can be produced, 
which can be fired from a standard, unmodified weapon at a target to give realism.  Projectiles of this kind have been successfully produced and used with copper or 
bronze particles in a plastics matrix. They are relatively expensive to produce, and the 
maximum density achievable with this type of material is of the order of 4 gm/cc. These 
projectiles can provide realistic operation with gas-operated automatic weapons (such as 
many 5.56mm weapons) and also realistic recoil forces of the order of two-thirds that 
experienced with the standard ammunition. In addition these projectiles can be designed 
as frangible so that they break up with reduced ricochet on striking a hard target. However, most 9mm automatic weapons and also a significant proportion of 7.62 
and 5.56mm automatic weapons operate on the delayed blow-back or short recoil 
principle, and these weapons require a denser projectile material for automatic operation.
