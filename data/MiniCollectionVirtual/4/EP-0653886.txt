<ABSTRACT>
The video on demand network includes a video server 
(US) able to transmit a plurality of mutually delayed 

instances of a video signal stored therein, and a plurality 
of user stations (US11, ..., USNM) coupled to the video 

server and able to transmit to that server a request signal 
to request for the transmission of an instance to it. The 

video server starts transmission of the requested instance 
after a predetermined waiting time has elapsed since the 

receipt of the request signal. This waiting time is 
determined in function of the number of instances which are 

in the course of being transmitted at the receipt of the 
request signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video on demand
network including a video server able to transmit a plurality
of mutually delayed instances of a video signal stored
therein, and a plurality of user stations coupled to said
video server and able to transmit to said video server a
request signal to request for the transmission of a said
instance to said requesting user station, said video server
starting transmission of said requested instance after a
predetermined waiting time has elapsed since the receipt of
said request signal.Such a video on demand network is already known in
the art, e.g. from the article "System architecture for a
large scale video on demand service", by W. Sincoskie, Computer
Networks and ISDN Systems 22, 1991, pp. 155-162. In the
latter article the instances are referred to as phases and
are transmitted with a constant inter-instance delay which is
the maximum time the user station has to wait before
receiving a new instance after it has issued a request
signal. Thus the average waiting time is equal to half this
inter-instance delay and decreases with decreasing inter-instance
delay. On the other hand, this inter-instance delay
also determines the bandwidth to be provided and allocated to
the video signal in the network in order to allow all
instances to be transmitted simultaneously, this bandwidth
increasing with a decreasing inter-instance delay. For
instance, when a video signal represents 100 minutes of
normal display time at a rate of 2 Mbit/s, and when the
inter-instance delay is 5 minutes, then a bandwidth of 20 x
2 or 40 Mbit/s has to be allocated to this video signal in
order to be able to transmit all 20 instances thereof.An object of the present invention is to provide a
video on demand network of the above known type, but which
while making use of at most the same bandwidth allows the 
average of said waiting time to be reduced for predetermined
values or value ranges of said number.According to the invention, this object is achieved
by the subject-matter claimed in claim 1 due to the fact that said video server determines said
waiting time in function of the number of instances which are
in the course of being transmitted at the receipt of said
request signal.The invention is based on the insight that by
determining the waiting time in function of the traffic
conditions, i.e. of the above number, this waiting time may
under certain circumstances, e.g. of low traffic, on the
average be smaller than when determined in the way of the
prior art, i.e. independently of

<CLAIMS>
Video on demand network including a video server (VS) and a plurality of
user stations (US11,..., USNM) coupled to said video server (VS), said video server

(VS) is included to transmit a plurality of mutually delayed instances of a video
signal stored therein, each one of said plurality of instances being a transmission

version of said video signal, each one of said plurality of user stations (US11, ...,
USNM) is included to transmit to said video server a request signal to request for

starting transmission of one of said plurality of instances to said requesting user
station, said video server (VS) starting transmission of said one instance after a

predetermined waiting time (WT) has elapsed since the receipt of said request signal,

characterized
 in that said video server (VS) determines said waiting time (WT) in
function of a number of said plurality of instances which are in the course of being

transmitted upon receipt of a said request signal in such a way that when said
plurality of instances, which are in the course of being transmitted upon receipt of said request signal, increases, said

waiting time (WT) correspondingly gradually increases up to a maximum waiting
time (MWT).
Video on demand network according to claim 1, characterized in that said
video server (VS) uses a mathematical function specifying said waiting time (WT)

versus said number to determine said waiting time and operates in such a manner

that when within a waiting time for transmitting said one instance upon receiving of
said request signal of said requesting user station, also another request signal from

another user station is received by the video server (VS), a copy of this same one
instance is also transmitted to said other user station.
Video on demand network according to claim 2, characterized in that the
shape of said function is dependent on the frequency with which for said video

signal is requested by said user stations (US11,..., USNM) such that in the event
when said video signal represents a popular movie a mean waiting time of said 

waiting time (WT) is lower than in the event when said video signal represents a
less popular movie.
Video on demand network according to claim 1, characterized in that said
waiting time is also a function of the total number of instances related to all different

video signals and which are actually being transmitted.
Video on demand network according to claim 1, characterized in that said
video server additionally produces delayed instances of said video signal with a

predetermined constant inter-instance delay.
