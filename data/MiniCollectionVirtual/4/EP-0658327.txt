<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display cabinet with an open front or open rack
in which several drawers are provided for the display of small
articles, in particular cigarette boxes.In many tobacconists' shops there is because of the excessive supply
of smoking articles offered for sale too little space for the
effective display of smoking materials such as cigarette boxes or
packets, so that it is essential to make the most effective use
possible of all the available space. Moreover existing display
cabinets are difficult to refill with smoking materials such as
cigarette boxes which are arranged standing up in the drawers, so that
the brand names applied to them are less easily visible.In the U.S. Patent 2.953.254, the source of the preamble of claim 1,
is described a filing office frame in
which basket-like insets are provided for office papers. The frame
comprises guide rails capable of accomodating said insets and having a
vertical projection in the center. The insets are provided with
rollers for engagement with said rails whereby said insets are forced
to take up an inclined position on said projections when moved in said
rails for wihtdrawal from said frame.However such display cabinet or frame has the disadvantage that it is
not possible to give different desired sloping positions to the
drawers or to slid out of the display the drawers in an horizontal
position. Besides the display cabinet needs expensive guide rails.In order to remedy these disadvantages a display cabinet has been 
realized as described in independent claim 1.As a result a display cabinet is provided of which the drawers can be 
easily and simply filled in the horizontal position with all kinds of
articles such as cigarette boxes and which can afterwards be placed
in a sloping position, so that not only are the articles offered for sale
clearly visible but they can also be removed below from the sloping
drawers without difficulty.Particular embodiments of the invention are defined in dependent
claims 2 to 7.By way of example, and without in any way being exhaustive, a
description of a preferred embodiment of the display cabinet in
accordance with the invention is given below. This description refers
to the attached drawing where:
fig. 1 shows a vertical cross-section through the display cabinet;fig. 2 shows a front elevation of a drawer of the cabinet;fig. 3 shows the display cabinet with the drawers pulled out in
perspective;fig. 4 shows the display cabinet with the drawers in the sloping
position in which the articles offered
