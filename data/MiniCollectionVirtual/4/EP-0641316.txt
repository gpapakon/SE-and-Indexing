<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to novel phenylhydrazine 
derivatives which exhibit activity as insecticides, 
acaricides and nematicides. This invention is also 
directed to insecticidal, acaricidal or nematicidal 
compositions comprising such compounds as well as to 
methods of controlling insects, acarids and nematodes 
employing such compounds or compositions. Destruction by insects, acarids and nematodes 
presents a serious problem to agriculture. A wide 
variety of field crops are in need of protection from 
nematodes, acarids, and insects including such valuable 
crops as soybeans, corn, peanuts, cotton, alfalfa, rice 
and tobacco. In addition, vegetables, such as tomatoes, 
potatoes, sugarbeet, carrots, peas, and the like as well 
as fruits, nuts, ornamentals and seed bed crops such as 
apples, peaches, almonds, citrus fruit and grapes may 
also require protection from the ravages of such pests. Consequently, the development of new, more 
effective pesticides including insecticides, acaricides  
 
and nematicides represents an ongoing scientific 
activity. More particularly, the development of 
pesticides which are effective as both ovicides and 
larvicides are of interest. Chemical Abstracts 108(19) :163280d refers to alkyl 
phenylhydrazinecarboxylates said to be useful as 
acaricides. United States Patent 4,725,302 refers to 
substituted phenylhydrazines and phenyloxadiazolinones 
said to be useful as pesticides. European Patent 
0 067 471 refers to 7-substituted 2,3-dihydrobenzofurans 
said to be useful as pesticides or chemical 
intermediates. DerWent abstract 88-312695/44 refers to 
arylhydrazides of trifluoroacetic acid said to have 
fungidical, bacteriocidal, acaricidal, and antiseptic 
activity. Chemical Abstracts 105(17):152686c refers to 
various phenylhydrazines said to have activity against 
insects and mites. The instant invention relates to a compound having 
the structural formula (I) 
 
wherein: 
X is a) phenyl; C1-C4 phenylalkoxy; phenoxy; or 
benzyl; the phenyl ring of each substituent being 
optionally substituted with one or more of halogen, 
nitro, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 alkoxy, C1-C4 haloalkyl or 
dialkylamino; or b) one substituent from group a) and 
one or more substituents selected from C1-C4 alkoxy;  
 
halogen; C1-C4 alkyl; and C1-C4 alkylthio; Y is H, C1-C4 alkanoyl, C1-C4 haloalkanoyl, 
dialkoxyphosphoryl, alkylaminocarbonyl, 
haloalkylsulfonyl, or C1-C4 alkoxy carbonyl; R is H, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, C3-C6 cycloalkoxy, 
haloalkyl, alkoxyalkyl, arylalkoxy, alkenyl,
