<ABSTRACT>
A turnable closure to close the axial opening of a hollow-cylindrical body, a turnable lid (1) and the body (2) having cam threads which correspond to one another and, when the turnable lid (1) is turned, bring about an axial displacement of the turnable lid (1) relative to the body (2). Mutually facing axial sides (4, 5) of the turnable lid and of the body run in a plane inclined by a particular angle  alpha to the axis of the body. These axial sides of the turnable lid and of the body are aligned with one another in the closed position of the turnable closure.

Turning closure for closing the opening of a hollow
cylindrical body (2), wherein a hollow cylindrical turning

lid (1) displaceable within the body and the body (2) have
guide elements mating with each other in form-locking

relationship, which on rotation of the turning lid (1)
cause axial displacement of the turning lid (1) relative to

the body (2), characterised in that the guide elements are
a guide element of elliptical circumference formed on an

inwardly offset cylindrical surface region of the turning
lid (1) and projecting radially outwards, and a guide

element of elliptical circumference formed on a
corresponding cylindrical surface of the body (2) and

projecting radially inwards, which in each case extend in
a plane inclined at an acute angle to the axis of the body

(2), and in that the axial side edges (4, 5) of the
cylindrical surfaces of the outwardly offset region of the

turning lid (1) and body (2) facing towards each other
extend in a plane inclined at this acute angle, so that in

the closed position these side edges (4, 5) and also the
outer cylindrical surfaces of the turning lid (1) and body

(2) are aligned with each other.
Turning closure according to claim 1, characterised in
that on the cylindrical surface (6) of the turning lid (1)

which engages in the hollow cylindrical body (2) is
provided a radially outwardly extending locking projection

(7) which can engage resiliently in a corresponding locking
recess (8) in the inner cylindrical surface of the body (2)

(Fig. 3).
Turning closure according to claim 1, characterised in
that on the cylindrical surface (6) of the turning lid (1)

which engages in the hollow cylindrical body (2) is
provided an opening (9) penetrating this cylindrical

surface (6), in such a way that in the closed position it 
is completely covered by the cylindrical surface of the

body (2) and in the open position obtained by axial
displacement it is exposed by the cylindrical surface of

the body (2), and in that the body (2) is a container
holding material which can be dispensed through the opening

(9) (Fig. 1).
Turning closure according to claim 3, characterised in
that the opening (9) is provided with a dispensing spout

(10) which is mounted pivotably on the turning lid (1) and
which on axial displacement of the turning lid (1) in the

closing direction is automatically pivotable into a
position aligned with the cylindrical surface (6) of the

turning lid (1) and closing the opening (9) (Fig. 2).
Turning closure according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the body (2) and the turning lid (1)

are made as separate components from plastic.
Turning closure according to any of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the elliptical guide elements mating

with each other are provided with notches in order to
produce latching positions at the end points of the 180Â°

rotation.
