<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for predicting properties of cement. In 
particular, the method provides a method of predicting the thickening time of a cement 
slurry although it is by no means restricted to this use. In oilwell drilling, cement is used to secure a lining or casing inside a drilled hole. 
The casing is usually a steel tube and cement slurry is pumped between the casing and 
the borehole wall and allowed to set, so securing the casing in place. Casing is 
cemented into a borehole for various reasons. The casing prevents any enlargening of 
the hole by contact with the drill string or erosion by drilling mud and cuttings. This is 
particularly important where the borehole encounters soft underground formations. The 
cement also provides a seal between underground formations so that, for example, 
water at one level is not contaminated by oil flowing from another level via the 
borehole. Cement also seals the drilled wall of the borehole which can prevent gas 
entering the well while it is being drilled which can cause blow-out. In a typical cementing operation, casing is run into the borehole and cement is 
pumped from the surface through the casing such that it fills the annulus between the 
outer surface of the casing and the borehole wall from the bottom up. During this 
operation it is necessary for the cement to flow relatively easily so that it can be pumped 
and can fill the entire annulus. Once the cement is in place, it is desirable that it should 
set in a relatively short time in order that drilling can recommence. The time after 
mixing a cement slurry at which pumping is no longer possible because the cement has 
started to set is known as the thickening time and the composition of the slurry is 
selected according to the required thickening time. A knowledge-based slurry design 
system has been proposed by Dowell Schlumberger of Saint Etienne, France (see paper 
from Fourth Annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Petroleum Exploration and 
Production, Texas A&M University 1991) which relies on a large cement slurry 
database which can be consulted for proposals of slurries according to the conditions 
chosen. Before a slurry is pumped into a well, it is necessary to test the thickening time 
of a sample of the slurry. Thickening time measurements are made in a pressurised 
consistometer which conforms to the specification defined in API Spec. 10. The 
measurement is performed by first mixing a cement slurry, in accordance with a defined 
procedure and

<CLAIMS>
A method of predicting a time developing property of a cement slurry 
comprising obtaining the infrared spectrum of the cement or the cement slurry 

and obtaining a prediction of said time developing property by applying values 
representing said spectrum to a model formed by determining sp
ectra for a 
series of cement compositions and correlating these with measured values of the 

time developing property for the compositions in the series. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the time developing property is the 
thickening time of the slurry. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, comprising inputting values representing 
the infra red spectrum to an artificial neural network device configured to output 

a value representative of the predicted thickening time, the artificial neural 
network device being: 


a) configured to utilise each of said values representing the infra red 
spectrum as input values; 
b) provided with at least one hidden layer of at least one node; and 
c) trained with a dataset comprising series of values of spectrum and values 
of measured thickening time. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 1-3, comprising obtaining the Fourier 
transform infrared spectrum. 
A method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the artificial neural network device is 
configured to have one or two hidden layers, each with 1-12 nodes.
