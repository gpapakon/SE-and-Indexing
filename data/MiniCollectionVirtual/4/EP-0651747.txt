<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
carbostyril derivatives. The carbostyril derivatives of the present 
invention are represented by the following general 
formula (1): 
 
[wherein, R¹ is a hydrogen atom, a fluorine atom or a 
methyl group; R is a group of the formula 
 
(R² is a methyl group, a trifluoromethyl group or a 
nitro group), or a group of the formula 
 
(R³ is a fluorine atom and p is an integer of 2 or 3);  
 
and n is an integer of 2 or 3]. The carbostyril derivatives of the present 
invention have a strong activity for inhibiting the 
adhesion of platelets and show low adverse effects to 
the cardiovascular system, etc., and are useful agent 
for treatment and prevention of arteriosclerotic 
diseases and thrombotic diseases. Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid-Open)

represented by the following general formula: 
 
(wherein, R is an unsaturated heterocyclic residual 
group having 1 to 4 hetero atoms selected from the group 
consisting of a nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom and a 
sulfur atom; said unsaturated heterocyclic residual 
group may have, on the heterocyclic residual ring, 1 to 
3 substituents selected from the group consisting of an 
oxo group; a thio group; a phenyl group; a phenyl group 
which may have, on the phenyl ring, 1 to 3 substituents 
selected from the group consisting of a lower alkyl  
 
group, a halo-lower alkyl group, a halogen atom, a 
hydroxyl group, an amino group, a lower alkylamino 
group, a carboxyl group and a lower alkoxy group; a 
cycloalkyl group; a phenylthio group; a lower alkyl
