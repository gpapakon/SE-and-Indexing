<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for determining the properties and/or the composition of foundry moulding sand, in which some of the properties are determined in a test sleeve (5) receiving a sample of moulding sand. In order to provide a method and a test method which allow a simpler, more rapid determination of properties of the moulding sand which are essential for a planned use, it is proposed according to the invention that an ultrasonic measurement be undertaken on the sample of moulding sand, at least the measurement or determination of one further property of the sample of moulding sand being carried out independently hereof and, from the combined results of the ultrasonic measurement and the further measurement, the composition and/or the technological properties of the sample are determined. In order to provide a device which allows a simpler, more rapid determination of properties of the moulding sand which are essential for a planned use, it is proposed according to the invention that an ultrasonic transducer be provided on at least one surface adjacent to the test body.

A method of determining the properties and/or composition of foundry
moulding sand, wherein said determining operation is effected by firstly a sample of

the composition being compacted or compressed and the length of the sample
compressed in that way being determined in at least one direction and the progression

of elastic waves being measured by means of ultrasound, 
characterised in that
 the
progression and absorption of elastic waves is measured by means of ultrasound along

said direction and said measurement is used in combination with at least one further
