<ABSTRACT>
A spinal disc prosthesis (5) comprises an upper rigid 
plate (12), a lower rigid plate (14), and an elastomeric core (16) 

interposed between the plates (12,14) and adhered to the plates (12,14). 
The elastomeric core (16) has an upper portion (30) with an outer 

peripheral surface (32) extending substantially perpendicular to 
the upper plate (12). A lower portion (34) of the elastomeric core (16) 

has an outer peripheral surface (36) extending substantially 
perpendicular to the lower plate (14). An intermediate portion (38) 

of the elastomeric core (16), extending between the upper (30) and 
lower (34) portions, has a concave outer peripheral surface (40). 

Each of the upper (12) and lower (14) plates has a plurality of ribs (50-52) 

extending into the elastomeric core (16) to secure the 
elastomeric core (16) to the upper (12) and lower (14) plates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an artificial spinal
disc prosthesis to replace a damaged or degenerated spinal
disc.A known spinal disc prosthesis is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 3,867,728. U.S. Patent 3,867,728 discloses a
spinal disc prosthesis which in one form comprises a single
piece of elastomer molded to have a concave outer
peripheral surface. The elastomer is interposed between
and adhered to two outer covering elements. The concave
outer peripheral surface extends from one of the covering
elements to the other of the covering elements. When a
bending moment is applied to the spinal disc prosthesis,
the concave peripheral surface of the elastomeric core is
stretched along one side. Stresses induced in the disc
prosthesis, due to the stretching of the one side of the
elastomeric core, are greatest at the interfaces between
the elastomeric core and the two covering elements. 
Therefore, the covering elements could possibly separate
from the elastomeric core.U.S. Patent No. 5,071,437 discloses a spinal disc
prosthesis comprising an upper flat rigid plate, a lower
flat rigid plate and a flat elastomeric core interposed
between the plates and adhered to the plates. A porous
coating is provided on the plates adjacent to the
elastomeric core to secure the plates to the elastomeric
core. When a crack forms between one of the plates and the
elastomeric core, the crack may propagate across the
interface between the plate and the elastomeric core
causing the plate to separate from the elastomeric core.The present invention provides a new and improved
spinal disc prosthesis to replace a damaged spinal disc.
The spinal disc prosthesis of the present invention
comprises an upper rigid plate, a lower rigid plate, and an
elastomeric core interposed between the plates and adhered
to the plates. The elastomeric core has an upper portion
extending from the upper plate. The upper portion of the
elastomeric core has an outer peripheral surface extending
substantially perpendicular to the upper plate. A lower
portion of the elastomeric core extends from the lower
plate and has an outer peripheral surface extending
substantially perpendicular to the lower plate. An
intermediate portion of the core extends between the upper 
and lower portions and has a concave outer peripheral
surface. When a bending moment and/or a translational
force is applied to the spinal disc prosthesis, the
stresses due to the stretching of one side of the concave
surface are reduced at the intersection of the plates and
core compared to a
