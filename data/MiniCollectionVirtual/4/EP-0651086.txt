<ABSTRACT>
- Ironing appliances - The invention relates to an electric steam iron comprising an ironing sole (3) and means (5) for heating the sole (3) which are associated with means (35) for an automatic interruption of operation which are activated when the iron is at a standstill. According to the invention, use is made of a sole (3) having low thermal inertia and being fixed to the body of the iron by means of a steam-permeable stiffening structure (10) made from a heat-insulating material. - Electric iron

An electric smoothing iron including a thin ironing sole plate (3)
and heater means (5) for heating the sole plate (3), which heater

means are associated with automatic switch-off means (35) which are
activated whenever the iron is at rest, the iron being characterized

in that it is a steam iron and includes a reinforcing structure (10)
for reinforcing the sole plate, which structure is interposed between

the plate and the body of the iron, is permeable to steam,
communicates with a steam-generating chamber (15), and is made of a

thermally insulating material.
An iron according to claim 1, in which a holding plate (6) covers
the heater element and the ironing plate (3), at least in part.
An iron according to claim 1 or 2, in which the plate (3), the
heater means (5), and in particular said holding plate (6),

constitute an ironing module having low thermal inertia which enables
the iron to remain in a horizontal position on the ironing board

without damaging it, the heating being switched off substantially
instantaneously.
An iron according to any one of claims 1 to 3, including a handle
(2) serving to manipulate the iron, said iron be
ing characterized in
that the automatic switch-off means (35) allow the heater means (5)

to be switched off, at least in part, substantially instantaneously
as soon as the handle (2) is released.
An iron according to any preceding claim, in which the heater
means (5) include a flat heater element covering the sole plate (3),

said element itself being covered by the holding plate (6).
An iron according to any preceding claim, in which the thickness
of the sole plate is less than 1 mm and the thickness of the ironing

module is less than 2 mm.
An iron according to any preceding claim, in which the reinforcing
structure (10) comprises a plate (11, 21) having a bottom face (11a) 

which extends over the sole plate (3) or the holding plate (6) spaced
apart therefrom by means of spacers (12, 25), the permeability of the

plate (11, 21) being such that it enables communication from one face
of the plate (11, 21) to the other, and between the spacers (12, 25).
An iron according to claim 7, in which the spacers (12) are
secured to the bottom face (11a).
An iron according to any preceding claim, in which the reinforcing
structure (10) is formed by a plate (21) having a honeycomb

structure, in which at least some cells (24) communicate with
adjacent cells, the walls (25) of the cells (24) forming the spacers

(12).
An iron according to claim 9, in which the reinforcing structure
(10) is formed by cells (24) at a single level forming a single-layer

structure.
An iron according to claim 9, in which the reinforcing structure
(10) includes cells (24) at several levels, preferably two levels,

each level being separated by the plate (11) which forms a screen
provided with perforations (30), and enables communication between

the levels.
An iron according to any one of claims 9 to 11, in which the
walls (25) of the cells (24) forming spacers are provided with holes

or slots (26).
An iron according to any preceding claim, including a steam-generating
chamber (15) in communication with the steam orifices (4)

of the plate (3) via the reinforcing structure (10).
An iron according to claim 13, in which the heater element (5) is
connected to an adjustable temperature limiter connected to the

automatic switch-off means (35), and in which it includes a second
heater element (32) associated with the steam-generating chamber (15) 

and connected to a second temperature limiter which is independent of
the automatic switch-off means (35).
An iron according to any one of claims 1 to 14, in which the
automatic switch-off means (35) comprise a user-presence detector

connected to an ON/OFF electrical circuit for the heater element (5),
which detector is capable of reducing or switching off the power

supply to the heater element (5) while ironing is taking place, as
soon as the presence of the user is no longer detected.
An iron according to claims 14 and 15, in which the presence
detector is a member for detecting the presence of the user's hand on

the handle (2) of the iron, said detector being functionally
connected only to the heater element (5) of the plate (3).
An iron according to any one of claims 1 to 17, in which heating
of the plate is switched back on again as soon as the temperature

thereof reaches a critical lower threshold, heating being limited in
order to allow the plate to reach an intermediate standby temperature

until the presence of the hand is detected again.
An iron according to any one of claims 1 to 17, characterized in
that it is connected to an external heating tube.
An iron according to claim 3, in which the material of the
holding plate (6) presents thermal properties which are substantially

identical to the material constituting the sole plate (3).
