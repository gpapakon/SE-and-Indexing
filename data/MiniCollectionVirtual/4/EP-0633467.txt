<ABSTRACT>
In a bulk material analyzer in which bulk material (38) is transported on a 
conveyor belt (40) through an activation region (34) between a pair of neutron sources 

(14) laterally disposed on one side of the activation region for emitting neutrons for 
bombarding the bulk material within the activation region to cause gamma-rays to be 

emitted from the bombarded bulk material and a pair of gamma-ray detectors (16) laterally 
disposed on another side of the activation region for detecting gamma-rays emitted from 

the bulk material, a primary neutron moderator (20) is disposed about the neutron sources 
for reducing the velocity of the emitted neutrons; and a secondary neutron moderator (22) 

is disposed about the primary neutron moderator for further reducing the velocity of the 
neutrons and is further disposed adjacent the lateral edges of the activation region for 

channeling and reflecting the neutrons into the activation region. The two gamma-ray 
detectors are disposed toward opposite lateral edges of the activation region, with each 

detector being skewed so that a portion of each detector that is closer to the edge of the 
activation region toward which the detector is disposed than to the lateral center of the 

activation region is disposed closer to a plane passing laterally through the center of the 
activation region than is another portion of each detector that is closer to the lateral center 

of the activation region than to the edge of the activation region toward which the 

detector is disposed. Spatial compensators (27) of primarily neutron moderating material 
are respectively disposed over the detectors for gradually reflecting neutrons toward the 

activation region, with reflection increasing in a direction away from the lateral center of 
the activation region. Bladders (62) containing a liquid primary neutron moderating 

material that expands and contracts with temperature variations, such as heavy water, are 
tightly packed within a compartment (60) for maintaining a substantial quantity of the 

liquid material between the neutron sources and the activation region notwithstanding 
thermal contraction of the liquid material; and a resilient compressible foam (64) is 

disposed about the bladders for enabling the tight packing of the liquid material to be 
maintained notwithstanding expansion and contraction of the liquid material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally pertains to bulk material analyzers and is 
particularly directed to improving the spatial uniformity of gamma-ray detection in bulk 
material analyzers of the type in which the bulk material is bombarded by neutrons within 
an activation region. Bulk material analyzers are used to measure the elemental content of bulk 
materials. One type of bulk material analyzer includes one or more neutron sources and 
one or more gamma-ray detectors. When the bulk material within an activation region 
between at least one neutron source disposed on one side of the activation region and at 
least one gamma-ray detector disposed on another side of the activation region opposite 
from said one side is bombarded by neutrons, secondary emissions of gamma-rays are 
produced from the bulk material and detected by the gamma-ray detector(s). The gamma-ray 
detector(s) produce signals which are processed to provide an indication of the 
elemental content of the bulk material. Different characteristic gamma-ray energy spectra 
are produced from different elements in the bulk material. By processing detected signals 
that are indicative of the gamma-ray spectrum, a measurement is provided of the 
quantitative elemental content of the bulk material. This measurement process is known in 
the art as prompt gamma-ray neutron activation analysis (PGNAA). In prior art bulk material analyzers, the response of the gamma-ray detectors to 
gamma-ray emission from different areas of a cross-sectional profile of the activation 
region is extremely non-uniform, with said response being less for a given quantity of a 
given bulk material located near the edges of the activation region than for the same given 
quantity of the same given bulk material located at the center of the activation region.. 
Therefore, the measured quantity of a given element within a non-homogeneous bulk 
material is dependent upon the particular location of such given element in a cross-sectional 
profile of the activation region.  The present invention provides a bulk material analyzer in which measurement 
accuracy is enhanced by improving the spatial uniformity of response by the gamma-ray 
detector(s) to gamma-ray emission from different areas of a cross-sectional profile of the 
activation region. The present invention provides a bulk material analyzer in which bulk material is 
received in an activation region between at least one neutron source and at least one 
gamma-ray detector, comprising a container having surfaces
