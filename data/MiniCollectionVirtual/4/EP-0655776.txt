<ABSTRACT>
In a passivating method using silicon oxidonitride, prior 
to forming that layer (10), the surface is planarized by 

overlying the circuit structures (2,3) with at least a 
first layer (8) of a dielectric material, and on top of 

this, a second layer (9) of a dielectric material. The 
layers have such thickness dimensions as to ensure 

planarization of the top surface. In addition, the 
invention may be used with a passivation method without 

oxidonitride wherein the underlying morphology is also 
planarized by forming those same dielectric layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for forming planarized 
dielectric layers in the manufacture of monolithic 
integrated circuits, and primarily to methods for 
passivating an integrated circuit wherein layers of silicon 
oxidonitride have been specifically formed. It is known that dielectric material layers, either 
interposed as inter-metal passivation layers between 
conductive layers or provided as final passivation coats 
over the last metallization layer, serve a dual function of 
electric insulation and of protection for the underlying 
structures of the integrated circuit from contaminants 
(impurities, moisture) or shocks. It is common practice in the pertinent art to assemble 
integrated circuits within plastics packages on account of 
these being economically more favorable. Most EPROM 
(Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) volatile storages, 
whether non-erasable such as OTP (One Time Programmable) 
EPROMs or electrically erasable ones (EEPROMs, Flash 
EEPROMs), come indeed encapsulated within plastics 
materials. These devices must be provided better resistance to 
moisture and contamination from outside sources than 
products which are assembled within ceramic packages 
inherently affording adequate protection. The porous nature 
of plastics materials makes them pervious to impurities and 
moisture, in fact. Additionally, the circuit assembly 
process. which includes heat application, followed by 
cooling, to the resin comprising the package and consequent  
 
release of moisture therefrom, does favor the intrusion of 
water into the circuits. Any water coming in contact with 
the conductive layers may corrode them or at least make the 
integrated circuit unstable and imperil its operation. As the persons of skill in the art are well aware, the most 
suitable material to provide such protection is silicon 
oxidonitride (SixOyNz), wherein the elements may be present 
in varying proportions, and which in the extreme instance 
of oxygen being altogether absent, would become silicon 
nitride, Si3N4. Oxidonitride is endowed with excellent imperviousness and 
retains good UV transmissivity, which properties allow it 
to be used for UV erasable storages. Accordingly, it is 
common pratice to use it in the final passivation layer. On the other hand, the oxidonitride in film form is 
characterized by poor step coverage, i.e. low ability to 
spread smoothly over so-called stepped surfaces and thereby 
thoroughly cover the underlying surface and retain a 
conforming pattern with the structure
