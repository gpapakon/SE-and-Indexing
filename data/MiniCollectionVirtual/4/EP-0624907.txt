<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device includes a lamination structure 
comprising a GaAs layer and an InGaAs layer (32b) grown on 

the GaAs layer, through which operating current flows in the 
thickness direction of the InGaAs layer. The InGaAs layer 

(32b) includes a plurality of very thin GaAs layers (1), 
through which most of the operating current passes due to 

tunnel effect, inserted into the InGaAs layer (23b) at 
prescribed intervals larger than a critical thickness that 

maintains a pseudomorphic state of an InGaAs crystal grown 
on a GaAs crystal. Therefore, segregation of In atoms, 

i.e., unfavorable move of In atoms in the growing InGaAs 
crystal toward the surface, which occurs remarkably when the 

InGaAs layer is grown at a high temperature, or elimination 
of In atoms can be suppressed by the very thin GaAs layers, 

so that the InGaAs layer can be grown on the GaAs layer at a 
high temperature without degrading the surface mohology of 

the InGaAs layer. As the result, an InGaAs layer with 
improved surface mohology, reduced contact resistivity and 

sheet resistivity, and improved uniformities of these 

resistivities in a wafer can be grown on the GaAs layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor devices 
having heterojunctions, such as HBTs (Heterojunction Bipolar 
Transistors) and HEMTs (High Electron Mobility Transistors) 
and, more particularly, to an improvement of surface 
mohology of a lattice mismatch crystal structure comprising 
a base semiconductor layer and a semiconductor layer having 
a lattice constant different from that of the base layer and 
grown on the base layer to a thickness larger than the 
critical thickness. Figure 10 is a perspective view illustrating a prior 
art HBT. In the figure, an HBT 200 includes a GaAs 
substrate 201 which is produced by a liquid encapsulated 
czochralski method (hereinafter referred to as LEC). A 
buffer layer 201a about 1 µm thick is disposed on the GaAs 
substrate 201. The buffer layer 201a comprises an intrinsic 
type (hereinafter referred to as i type) GaAs/AlGaAs 
superlattice layer about 800 nm thick and an i type GaAs 
layer about 200 nm thick layer. A collector contact layer 
211 is disposed on the buffer layer 201a. A collector layer 
212 is disposed on a center part of the collector contact 
layer 211, and collector electrodes 210 comprising three 
layers of AuGe/Ni/Au are disposed on the collector contact  
 
layer 211 at opposite sides of and spaced apart from the 
collector layer 212. The collector contact layer 211 
comprises an n⁺ type GaAs layer having a thickness of 500 nm 
and a dopant concentration of 5 x 10¹⁸ cm⁻³, and the 
collector layer 212 comprises an n type GaAs layer having a 
thickness of 500 nm and a dopant concentration of 5 x 10¹⁶ 
cm⁻³. A p⁺ type AlGaAs base layer 221 is disposed on the 
collector layer 212. The base layer 221 has a thickness of 
100 nm and a dopant concentration of 1 ∼ 4 x 10¹⁹ cm⁻³. An 
n type AlGaAs emitter layer 231 is disposed on a center part 
of the base layer 221. The emitter layer 231 has a 
thickness of 150 nm and a dopant concentration of 5 x 10¹⁷ 
cm⁻³. Base electrodes 220 comprising three layers of 
Ti/Ni/Au are disposed on the base layer 221 at opposite 
sides of and spaced apart from the emitter layer 231. In 
the AlGaAs base layer 221, the ratio of AlAs mixed crystal 
gradually increases upward from 0 to 0.1. The emitter layer 
231 comprises three AlGaAs layers, i.e., an AlGaAs layer 
grown on the base layer 221 with the AlAs mixed crystal 
ratio gradually increasing upward from 0.1 to 0.3, an 
Al0.3Ga0.7As layer grown thereon to a prescribed thickness, 
and an AlGaAs layer grown thereon with the AlAs mixed 
crystal ratio gradually
