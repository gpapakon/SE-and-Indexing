<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical urethane
resin obtained by reacting a polyisocyanate
compound with an active hydrogen compound. More
particularly, the invention relates to an optical
urethane resin of minimal coloration and high total
light transmission and free of optical distortion.In the field of optical urethane resins and
plastic lenses utilizing them, the resin obtained by
reacting a halogen-containing compound having more than
2 hydroxyl groups with an isocyanate compound (JP Kokai
S-58-164615/1983), the resin obtained by reacting a
mercapto group-containing compound with an isocyanate
compound (JP Kokai S-60-199016/1985) and a polyurethane
resin added with a phenolic stabilizer (JP Kokai H-5-78441/1993),
among others, have been proposed in many
patent applications, all alluding to optical lenses of
reduced coloration, high total light transmission and
low optical distortion.With regard to optical distortion, however, no
drastic removal remains to be attained and because of
the high rejection rate of products, the manufacturing
conditions have to be corrected from time to time.EP-A-0 506 315 discloses optical urethane resins in
which the problem of optical distortion is controlled by
the addition of a phenolic stabilizer. No mention is made
about other means of controlling the optical distortion.EP-A-0 505 150 discloses a method for improving the
storage stability of an isocyanate itself by adding
phenols. The stabilization of m-xylylene diisocyanate
having a hydrolyzable chlorine content of 0.010% by the
addition of phenol compounds. One object of the invention is to provide a novel
optical urethane resin.Another object of the invention is to provide a
optical product prepared by using the optical urethane
resin.The inventors of this invention made an intensive
exploration for isocyanate compounds contributory 
to the production of optical urethane resins which
would be colorless, transparent and free of optical
distortion and discovered that polyisocyanates of
low hydrolyzable chlorine content are optimal for the
above purpose. This invention has been developed on
the basis of the above finding.This invention as such provides an optical urethane
resin obtained by reacting a polyisocyanate selected from
the group consisting of an alicyclic polyisocyanate and an
araliphatic polyisocyanate, said polyisocyanate having a
hydrolyzable chlorine content of not greater than 100 ppm,
with an active hydrogen compound selected from the group
consisting of a polyol compound, a polythiol compound and
