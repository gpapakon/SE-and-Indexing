<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for recovery of valuable material by reduction of oxygen-bonded metals in metallurgical vessels, and a melt furnace plant having a partition projecting into the vessel from the furnace ceiling dividing the furnace into two parts, having a device for supplying thermal (heat) energy, material feed and melt discharge apparatuses and a connection to a gas purification unit, for carrying out the process. The process is characterised according to the invention in that a solid or liquid charge in the first reaction zone is subjected to thermal energy until, in the case of a solid charge, a melt bath forms, or in the case of a liquid charge a melt bath is maintained, in which liquid slag floats on a metallic melt bath, in that the melt bath is fed to a second reaction zone in which the slag comes into intimate contact with a reducing agent, and in that thermal energy preventing solidification is additionally supplied to the melt in the reduction zone.

<CLAIMS>
A method for recovering valuable substances by
reduction of oxygen-bound metals in metallurgical

vessels, wherein a solid or liquid charge is acted upon
by thermal energy in a first reaction zone (11) until,

in the case of a solid charge, a melt bath is formed
or, in the case of a liquid charge, a melt bath is

maintained, in which liquid slag (S) floats on a metal
melt bath (M), wherein furthermore the melt bath is fed

to a second reaction zone (12) in which the slag comes
into intimate contact with a reduction agent (R), the

reduction agent being piled up in column form and the
column height (h) being selected such that its weight

overcomes the buoyancy force of the oxidic slag bath
and the melt in the reduction zone is additionally

supplied with thermal energy which prevents freezing-up
by means of electrodes (54, 55) which project obliquely

into the reduction agent.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the molten metal is tapped continuously and the

slag discontinuously after the reduction work.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the flue gas present in the first reaction zone is

passed through the reduction agent and subsequently is
purified together with the nitrogen oxides of the

second reaction zone once it has given off its sensible
heat.
A melting furnace installation having a partition
wall projecting from the furnace cover into the vessel,

which wall divides the furnace vessel into two parts,
with a means for supplying thermal energy, with

material supply and melt removal devices and a 
connection to a gas purification plant, for performing

the method according to Claim 1,

characterised in that

the partition wall (21) from the furnace cover (13) of
the first furnace section (11) has a length (L) at

which the mouth (22) of the partition wall projects
into the slag (S) during the melting operation to

closely above the level (M) of the molten metal, that
the partition wall (21) in the region of the furnace

cover (13) has an opening (23) from the first to the
second furnace section (11, 12), that the second

furnace section (12) is shaft-shaped, with a shaft
height (H) which extends beyond the column height (h)

of the reduction agent and the top end (14) of which is
provided with a connection (41) for joining to the gas

purification plant (42), and
that electrodes (54, 55) project laterally into the
second furnace vessel section (12) in the region above

the melt, which electrodes are connected to an energy
supply means (56).
A melting furnace installation according to Claim
4, characterised in that the partition wall (21) in the

region of the cover (13) has openings (23) [sic] of

such a size that gas can flow through without reduction
agent (R) passing into the first furnace section (11).
A melting furnace installation according to Claim
4, characterised in that the region of the partition

wall (21) which dips into the slag (S) during the
melting operation has elements (24) cooled by liquid

media.
A melting furnace installation according to Claim
4, characterised in that a supply means (31) provided

with a lock chamber (34) for the reduction agent (R) is 
provided at the top end (14) above the gas offtake (41)

of the second furnace vessel (12).
A melting furnace installation according to Claim

4, characterised in that the common base (15) of the
first and second furnace vessel sections (11, 12) is

inclined towards the taphole (16) at an angle of
inclination α of 1 to 70°.
