<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an alignment mark for the X directional 
alignment of a chip area on a semiconductor 

wafer, for example. The alignment mark comprises 
recesses (12) and projections (13) formed on a semiconductor 

substrate (10). The recesses (12) or projections 
(13) are repeatedly arranged in the X direction. 

The X directional width of the recesses (12) or projections 
(13) is set smaller than the X directional width 

of a grain on a metal film formed on the recesses (12) 
and projections (13) or the average particle size, as 

viewed from above the semiconductor substrate (10). The 
projections (13) may be formed by a wall-like insulating 

layer (11) formed on the semiconductor substrate (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the alignment of a 
semiconductor device by an aligner, such as a reduction-type 
projection printing device. Due to the recent trend of ever improving the integration 
and performance of semiconductor devices, there 
are demands for finer patterning and higher precision in 
the lithography technology. The most typical printing device today is a 
reduction-type projection printing device (hereinafter 
called "stepper"). Schemes of aligning a semiconductor 
device using this stepper include the alignment which 
uses a laser beam and the alignment which involves image 
processing. FIGS. 1 and 3 show the shapes of conventional 
alignment marks. FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view taken 
along the line II-II' in FIG. 1, and FIG. 4 is a 
cross-sectional view taken along the line IV-IV' in 
FIG. 3. Each of the alignment marks comprises recesses 12 
and projections 13 formed on an insulating layer 11 on a 
semiconductor substrate 10. The recesses 12 and projections 
13 are alternately arranged on the semiconductor 
substrate 10. The alignment of the semiconductor device 
is performed by detecting the edges of the recesses 12 
and projections 13 to recognize this alignment mark. The technology of planarizing metal films has  
 
progressed. For example, a high-temperature sputtering 
method which deposits a metal film while heating the 
semiconductor substrate to 460°C or above, and a 
laser melting method which irradiates a laser beam on a 
deposited metal film to melt the film have been 
developed. If a metal film, which has been planarized by the 
high-temperature sputtering or laser melting method, is 
formed on an alignment mark, therefore, it is difficult 
to recognize this alignment mark. FIG. 5 illustrates a metal film (planarized) formed 
on the alignment mark shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. FIG. 6 is 
a cross-sectional view taken along the line VI-VI' in 
FIG. 5. FIG. 7 illustrates a metal film (planarized) 
formed on the alignment mark shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. 
FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view taken along the line 
VIII-VIII' in FIG. 7. When a metal film 14 is formed on the alignment 
mark, the alignment is performed by recognizing the 
recesses and projections on the metal film 14. With 
regard to the alignment, therefore, it is ideal that the 
same recesses and projections as those of the alignment 
mark be formed on the metal film. As the metal film 14 is planarized, however, the 
recesses and projections of the metal film 14 on the 
alignment mark become smaller than those of
