<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method and 
apparatus for distributing a vapor-liquid, mixed phase feed 
to a contacting zone in a reactor. The invention particularly 
relates to an apparatus and method for uniformly distributing 
vapor-liquid phases into contact with granular solids in a 
catalytic contactor vessel. Among the various commercial processes practiced, 
an important one involves the physical or chemical treatment 
of hydrocarbons and other organic materials with bodies of 
granular contact material. Frequently such a process involves 
contacting a two-phase mixture of liquid and vapor with the 
contacting material and the introduction of such mixtures into 
the bed of granular contact material in a uniformly 
distributed manner. Uniform distribution of a liquid and vapor into a 
granular bed of contact material is a difficult goal to 
achieve. In a typical process a vapor-liquid feed material 
is introduced into a vessel which is divided into an upper and 
lower portion by one or more distribution trays. The distribution 
trays are provided with a number of overflow weirs, or 
the like, and provide the sole means of fluid communication 
between the upper portion of the vessel and the lower portion 
of the vessel, the latter of which contains a bed of the 
granular contact material. The feed mixture is introduced into the upper 
portion of the vessel and the liquid collects in a pool or 
reservoir on the tray from whence it flows over the rims of 
the weir into the bed of contact material. An inherent 
disadvantage of such an approach is that the methods of 
fabrication normally employed in the construction of reactors 
are not sufficiently precise to ensure an absence of irregularities 
(differences in the outlet weir elevation, tilting  
 
of the weir, tilting of the distribution tray, etc.) in the 
reactor. In addition the operating conditions within the 
reactor are frequently such as to bring about distribution tray 
warping, thus contributing to even more irregularities. As a 
result, some of the outlets will inevitably exhibit little or no 
overflow of liquid feed. It has been proposed to provide slots or V-notches in 
the weir to minimize the effect of these irregularities. Such 
proposals have not eliminated the problems associated with 
irregular flow. Further, the liquid feeds have a tendency to 
channel down the inner surface of the outlet weir and impinge 
upon the catalyst bed in relatively thin streams which bury 
themselves deep in the bed before spreading laterally to
