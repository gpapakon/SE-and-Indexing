<ABSTRACT>
This process makes it possible to manufacture a handle (16) for a tool, especially a screwdriver, including a metallic member (12) equipped with a part (14) intended to be set into the handle (16). According to this process, a sleeve (18) is manufactured, a metal spindle (14) is placed inside the sleeve (18), and a connecting piece (20) made of plastic is injection-moulded between the spindle (14) and the sleeve (18) so that the assembly comprising the sleeve (18) and connecting part (20) forms the handle (16) of the tool. According to one embodiment, the metal spindle is formed by the set-in part (14) of the metallic member (12).

Method of manufacturing a handle (16) for a tool,
especially a screwdriver, comprising a metal component

(12) fitted with a part (14) intended to be embedded
in the handle (16), the method being of the type in

which :

a sleeve (18) is manufactured
a metal spindle (14;40) is placed inside the
sleeve (18) ; and
a bonding part in plastics material is
injection moulded between the spindle (14;40) and the

sleeve (18) in order that the assembly - sleeve
(18)/bonding part (20) forms the tool handle (16);
characterised in that
 the metal spindle (14;40)
is placed inside the sleeve (18) in such a manner that

it appreciably extends over the whole length of the
sleeve, the latter being placed in an injection mould

in such a way that at least one of its ends, open, is
extended by a hollow in the mould forming a moulding

cavity.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in

that the metal spindle is formed by the embedding part
(14) of the metal component (12).
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 one removes the metal spindle (40) from the 
handle (16) and that the embedding part (14) of the

metal component is force fitted in the hole (42) left
open in the handle after the withdrawal of the spindle

(40).
Method according to claim 3, 
characterised in
that
 the metal spindle (40) has a tapered shape in
order to facilitate its withdrawal from the handle

(16) and in that the hole (42) left open after the
withdrawal of the spindle (40) is bored in order to

adapt its size to the embedding part (14) of the metal
component.
Method according to any one of the claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the sleeve is manufactured with
at least one plastics material injection moulding a

central part (22) and by injection moulding from a
casting 
on the latter a peripheral part (24).
Method according to claim 5, 
characterised in

that the central part (22) of the sleeve comprises a
plastic material harder than that of the peripheral

part (24) of the sleeve.
Method according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterised
in that
 the central part (22) of the sleeve and the
peripheral part (24) of this sleeve are moulded so as

to form on their contact surfaces projections and 
complementary securing recesses (28 to 34).
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the moulding cavity surrounds
one end of the sleeve (18) so that, when the bonding

part (20) is injection moulded, an extension (20A,20B)
of this part (20) is moulded from a casting on the

outside of the end of the sleeve, after the material
injected has spread on the length of the sleeve (18).
Method according to claims 5 and 8 taken
together, 
characterised in that
 the peripheral part
(24) of the sleeve is moulded from a casting on the

central part (22) of this sleeve, leaving free at
least one end of the central part (22) so as to allow

it to be overlapped by the external extension
(20A,20B) of the bonding part (20).
Method according to claim 8 or 9, 
characterised
in that
 the external extension (20A) of the bonding
part defines the free end of the handle (16), this

extension (20A) and the end of the sleeve (18)
overlapped by same being moulded so as to form on the

contact surfaces projections and complementary
securing recesses (36,38). 
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the moulding cavity surrounds
one end (14A) of the metal spindle (14) protruding at

the end of the sleeve (18) in order that, at the time
of the injection moulding of the bonding part (20), an

extension (20C) of this part is moulded from a casting
on the protruding end (14A) of the spindle (14) after

the injection material has spread along the sleeve
(18).
Method according to any one of claims 5 to 11,

characterised in that
 the bonding part (20) comprises
a plastics material of hardness appreciably identical

to that of the central part (22) of the sleeve.
Tool comprising a metal component (12) fitted
with a part (14) embedded in the handle (16), this

handle (16) comprising a sleeve (18) surrounding a
bonding part (20) in plastics material in which the

metal component is embedded (12) 
characterised in that

the bonding part (20) comprises at least one extension
(20A, 20B; 20C) external to the sleeve (18)

overlapping one end of this sleeve or one end of the
embedding part (14) of the spindle protruding outside

the sleeve (18). 
Tool according to claim 13, 
characterised in that

the sleeve is of plastics material and comprises two
tubular parts (22,24), one central and the other

peripheral, the peripheral part (24) extending
longitudinally between the two ends of the central

part (22) overlapped by two external extensions
(20A,20B) of the bonding part (20) overlapping the two

ends of the sleeve (18).
Tool according to claim 14, 
characterised in that

the central part (22) and the peripheral part (24) of
the sleeve comprise plastics materials of different

hardnesses.
