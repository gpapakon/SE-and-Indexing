<ABSTRACT>
The composite resin reinforcement system for use in dental operations provides improved strength by the use of etched glass fiber material which is then silanated with an organo-functional silane and utilized in a composite resin (18) in the dental operation. The glass fiber material may by uniform (10) or random mesh (12), rope (14), thread or other suitable shapes. The etched silanated glass fiber material is utilized in the composite resin (18) for restoring and/or splinting teeth.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Dental Materials And Process Utilizing Glass FiberBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to an improvement in the field of prosthetic dentistry and more particular¬ ly to the field of restorative and splinting operations in the field of dentistry using various resins.Use of various composite resins in dentistry to restore one or more teeth and to improve the cosmetic appearance of the teeth has been known for some time and has been finding greater use in dentistry. However, the use of composite resins, such as macrofills and microfills in dentistry have had some drawbacks such as an inability to handle stress in particular cases, for example such as in cantilevering and in the case of bruxers. However, recently, an attempt has been made to eliminate the shortcomings of the use of composite resins by reinforcing the composite resin with a silk fabric. See Golub, The Silk Wrap Technique For Composite Bonding, The New York State Dental Journal, May 1987, Volume 53, No. 5, pp. 28- 29, and U.S. patents 4,728,291-Golub and 4,799,888-Golub. However, applicant herein has invented a new and improved composite resin reinforcement system for use in dental operations which provides improved strength characteristics.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONBriefly and basically, in accordance with the present invention, applicant has invented a new and improved means for reinforcing composite resin systems for restoring and/or splinting teeth which utilizes an 

 etched glass fiber material which is treated with an organo-functional silane. The etched glass fiber material is preferably etched with an acid such as hydrofluoric acid or 1.23% acidulated phosphate 

 fluoride, although any other suitable etchant may be utilized which will be effective in etching glass and particularly glass fiber material.The glass fiber material may preferably be a uniform mesh, a random mesh or a rope or thread type material which may be utilized in dental operations as described hereinafter. Of course, other suitable forms of glass fiber material may be utilized in the particu¬ lar dental application. Such glass fiber products are commercially available under the FIBERGLAS trademark of Owens-Corning Corp. as well as from others. Any of a number of organo-functional silanes may be utilized to act as coupling agents between the glass fiber material and the composite resin. The formation of a chemical bridge between the coupling agents and a glass substrate requires both a reactive silane and a reactive site on the glass surface. In
