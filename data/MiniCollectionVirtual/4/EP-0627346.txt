Screen wiping apparatus of the type including an articulation
for a crank (1) which is coupled by means of a pivot axis element (3)

to a crank arm (2), the said axis element having a head (4), a first
cylindrical shank portion (5) and a second cylindrical shank portion (6)

of smaller diameter, the head and the two shank portions being
coaxial, the said axis element having a deformation at its end (7)

opposite to the head (4), for coupling the crank (1) and the crank arm
(2) together and for fastening the axis element (3) on the crank arm

(2), characterised in that the apparatus includes a sleeve (8) disposed
within the crank (1), with the first shank portion (5) passing through

the sleeve, a reinforcing element (12; 28, 29) carried by the crank
arm (2), with the second shank portion (6) extending through the

reinforcing element, and at least one ring (10) immobilised against
rotation with respect to the crank and interposed between the head

(4) and the corresponding anterior surface of the sleeve (8).
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
apparatus includes a second ring (15) which is immobilised against

rotation with respect to the crank, and which is interposed between
the anterior surface of the reinforcing element (12: 28, 29) and the

corresponding anterior surface of the sleeve (8).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the reinforcing element consists of an insert (12)

carried by the crank arm (2). 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the reinforcing element consists of two plate

members (28) disposed on either side of the crank arm (2).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the ring (10, 15) has a circular central bore (20)

and a non-circular external edge (21) for preventing its rotation.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the ring (10, 15) has a notched outer edge for

preventing its rotation.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the ring (10, 15) has a projecting element (26,

27) for preventing its rotation.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that the ring (10, 15) has a notch (22, 23) for

preventing its rotation.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that it includes a sealing ring (30) having a central

portion fixed to the reinforcing element (12; 28, 29) and a tubular
portion (32) bearing radially on a cylindrical extension (35) of the

crank (1).
