Method for receiving periodically repeating teletext data
which comprise digital information blocks and are contained in a

television signal, in the case of which the time periods in which
the periodically repeating teletext data can be expected are

chosen and the information blocks which have been received within
each of these time periods are selected and evaluated in that n

incorrectly transmitted information units are corrected using
additionally transmitted error protection information (FEC) , in

a corresponding manner to their correction capability, and in
that the correctness of the wanted information within each

selected, and possibly corrected, information block is determined
using additionally transmitted check information (CRC), n being a

positive integer, and in that the error check for the information
block under consideration is terminated prematurely as soon as

the wanted information in an information block has been
identified as being error free using the check information which

is also transmitted,

characterized in that

one or more information units of the information units in the
information block under consideration are inverted step by step,

in that a correction attempt is carried out for n information
units for each inversion step using the error protection

Information (FEC) and the check information is used after each
correction attempt to determine whether the correction was

successful, in that the error check is terminated in the event of
successful correction, and in that, after every unsuccessful

correction attempt, the inverted information units which an
attempt has been made to correct are reset to the the initial

state after every unsuccessful correction attempt. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, in the event of unsuccessful correction, the positions of

the inverted information units, which an attempt has been made to
correct, are fixed and are omitted in subsequent correction

attempts.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that, in the event of the correction measures being unsuccessful,

the correction measures are repeated in an information block
which is received later and is identical (virtually identical)

with the exception of transmission errors.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that, in the event of the repeated correction measures being

unsuccessful, a further error correction is carried out by
comparison of the virtually identical information blocks which

have been received at different times, one or more information
units of those information units in one of the two information

blocks which have been identified as being different on the basis
of the comparison of the two information blocks being inverted

step by step, in that a correction attempt for n information
units which have been identified as being different is carried

out for each inversion step using the error protection
information, and in that, after every correction attempt, the

check information is used to determine whether the correction was
successful, in that, in the event of successful correction, the

error check is terminated and that information block on which an
attempt at correction was made first is assessed as the correctly

identified information block, and in that, after every
unsuccessful correction attempt, the inverted information units

on which an attempt has been made to correct are reset to the
initial state.
