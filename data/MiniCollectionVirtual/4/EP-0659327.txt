<ABSTRACT>
A multi-level layered cellular radio architecture serves mobile subscriber stations (21) moving within the system. Best server selection is performed for the mobile stations (21) by assigning within each cell (C1-C10) a preference value to each other one of the cells (C1-C10) with which is associated by proximity of service area. The strength of the radio signal received by the mobile station (21) from the serving cell (C1-C10) as well as the radio channels of associated cells (C1-C10) is measured. A decision as to the best serving cell (C1-C10) for the mobile station (21) is made based upon both the preference value of the associated cells (C1-C10) and the signal strength of their respective radio channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to handoff of mobile
stations within cellular radio systems and, more
particularly, to handoff within layered cell structures
of such systems.In cellular radio communication systems a
geographic area is divided into a plurality of
individual regions referred to as cells, each of which
is provided with radio service on a plurality of
separate RF channels the frequencies of which are
reused among different cells sufficiently separated
from one another that there is a sufficiently low level
of interference between them. When a mobile station
receiving radio service from a particular base station
serving a particular cell moves from that cell into
another adjacent cell, communication with the mobile
station is "handed off" from the first base station to
the second base station serving the adjacent cell.
Such handoff is accomplished by a mobile switching
center (MSC) to which all of the base stations are
connected and which controls the allocation of
communication channels to the individual mobiles moving
throughout the region served by the cells.As the demand for cellular radio service increases
over time, the capacity of existing systems has been
severely stressed to serve all the subscribers who
would like to have access to the system, particularly
in major metropolitan areas. To address this demand,
cellular radio technology is currently moving from
analog based systems, in which each subscriber
communication channel is allocated to a single radio
channel, to digital based systems in which a plurality 
of subscriber channels can be assigned to each radio
channel through time division multiple access (TDMA)
radio technology. In TDMA radio, each radio channel is
divided into a plurality of time slots and a digitized
portion of each subscriber's conversation is broadcast
in a different time slot. However, even with such
improvements in channel capacity, there exist certain
areas within major metropolitan areas in which the
demands on the system are so great that it cannot be
successfully satisfied by existing cellular radio
architectures. For example, in the area in and around
a convention center located in a major metropolitan
area, the channel usage by portable cellular radio
transceivers may be so great that the demands for
service cannot be satisfied by the entire channel
capacity of the base station serving the cell within
which the convention center is located. In such
situations, it has been proposed to provide additional
"layers" of cellular radio coverage provided by
additional
