<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to subceilings of the type that
utilizes square or rectangular panels supported on a
suspended framework of interconnected inverted T-bar rails
arranged in a series of geometric grid-like patterns, e.g.,
square, rectangular, etc. More particularly, this invention
relates to decorative elements for covering the bottom
surfaces of the T-bar rails while the panels rest on and are
supported on the top surfaces of the T-bar rails.Subceilings formed from square or rectangular
panels resting on the top surfaces of horizontally disposed
flanges of inverted T-bar rails are well known. Typically,
a framework of rails is formed with parallel main runners,
suspended from the ceiling above, intersecting with cross
rails to provide a grid pattern, usually as 600 mm x 600 mm (2 feet x 2 feet)
squares or 600 mm x 1200 mm (2 feet x 4 feet) rectangles, to accommodate
similarly-sized subceiling panels. In its basic functional
form, the subceilings would have the bottom surfaces of the
rail flanges exposed as flat boundary strips between the
edge supported panels. For what has become the conventionally styled and
dimensionally standardized version of the inverted T-bar
rail, the industry has developed tight-fitting capping
elements. By cutting and removing a portion of the panel
along its length- and width-extending bottom edges to
accommodate the thickness of the capped T-bar rails, a
substantially smooth flat bottom surface of the subceiling
may be defined.It has been an objective to provide the option of
various architecturally-satisfying decorative effects in
suspending ceilings that have exposed flat T-bar flanges in
addition to the mere capping discussed in the previous
paragraph. It has also been an objective to provide such
decorative effects with elements that are designed to be
easily added in place or easily removed and replaced to
satisfy the customer's "addiction" to his or her "remodeling
habit".US-A-4,848,054
proposes a hollow beam that is readily attachable to the
conventional T-bar support from below without requiring
additional fastening hardware such as clips or screws. It is
alleged that those hollow beams not only are useful in new
ceiling installations but have the potential for convenient
future renovation by changing to hollow beams of different 
size, shape, color or texture without disturbing the
support framework.US-A 4 452 021, on which the preamble of claim 1 is
based, discloses a decorative moulding for the T-bars of
a subceiling. The moulding is roughly triangular in

<CLAIMS>
A subceiling having panels (18) supported by a
suspended framework consisting essentially of

longitudinally extending main runner members and cross
runner members (15), each runner member (15) being

configured as an inverted T-bar rail having a transverse
pair of opposed bottom flanges extending longitudinally

and being of a standarized total width, a plurality of
miniature beams (10) extending longitudinally, their

length being substantially equal to the length of said
rails and having means (12) for fastening to the T-bar

rails, each of said beams (10) consisting essentially of:
a flat portion (11) having an upper surface and a bottom

surface, its width being defined by two longitudinal
edges; a first return flange disposed along one upper

edge of the flat portion (11) integral therewith and
extending inwardly; a second return flange disposed along

a second upper edge of the flat portion (11) integral
therewith and extending inwardly; each of said return

flanges having a downward-facing surface and an inwardly
facing edge; said return flanges adapted to hold the

upper surface of said flat portion (11) substantially
flush against the longitudinally extending T-bar rails

(15) of the runner member; one connecting element (13)
integral with said bottom surface of said flat portion

(11) and extending downwardly from a single area and
longitudinally along the length of said bottom surface of

said flat portion of said longitudinally extending beam;
and an exposed decorative element (14) attached to or

integral with the said connecting element and comprising
a pair of transversely-extending elements; characterised

in that the said pair of transversely-extending elements
are attached to or integral with the said connecting

element at its downward extremity only; and in that in normal
use the panels (18) are arranged to rest on the return

flanges of the miniature beams (10).
A subceiling as in claim 1, wherein the
decorative element (14) is in the same horizontal plane 

as that of the panels (18) supported on the suspended
framework.
A subceiling as in claim 1 wherein the decorative
element (14) is in a lower horizontal plane than that of

the panels (18) supported on the suspended framework.
A subceiling as in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein
each of the decorative elements (14) of four miniature

beans (10) at the intersection of main runner members and
cross runner members (15) are double-mitered to provide a

smooth appearing intersection.
A subceiling as in any one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the decorative element comprises a plurality of

elements integral with its bottom surface and extending
downwardly from relatively narrow areas along the length

of said bottom surface, at least two or said elements
being disconnected from each other, wherein the visual

appearance of said downwardly extending elements provide
the decorative effect.
A subceiling as in claim 5 wherein all said
downwardly-extending elements are disconnected from one

another.
