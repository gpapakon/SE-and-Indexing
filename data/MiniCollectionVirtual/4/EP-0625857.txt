<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a video server 
(DS) for transmitting video signals (VS) to user stations in 

response to the receipt of control signals issued by these 
user stations and including a plurality (HDA) of memories 

(HDASA, HDASB) which are controlled by a plurality of memory 
controllers (OBC, SCSIC-A/B). 
It is proposed to control the memory controllers 
based on said control signals by a server control means (DSC, 

PCM1/PCMN) which includes a server controller (DSC) and a 
plurality of program control modules (PCM1/PCMN) each of 

which is associated to a subset (HDA1/HDAN) of said plurality 
(HDA) of memories (HDASA, HDASB) and to a subset of said 

plurality of memory controllers (OBC, SCSIC-A/B). 
This server control means is kept relatively simple 

if said server controller activates for each requested video 
signal the program control module in which associated subset 

of memories this video signal is stored and if this program 
control module, upon being activated, operates its associated 

memory controllers to achieve said transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video server for
transmitting video signals to user stations in response to
the receipt of control signals issued by said stations and
including a plurality of memories controlled by a plurality
of memory controllers and server control means controlling
said plurality of memory controllers based on said control
signals.Such a video server is already known in the art,
e.g. from the article "A store-and-forward architecture for
video-on-demand service", by A. D. Gelman et al., Proc. ICC
'91, June 1991, pp. 842-846 and is referred to therein as an
information warehouse.The architecture proposed for the video server and
shown in Fig. 3 of the article requires the use of a server
control means, constituted by the IWH service processor,
which is relatively complex because it has to perform both an
over-all control, i.e. call handling, routing, billing, etc.,
as well as an individual control of the transmission of each
video signal. The article thus fails to account for the fact
that the latter control is very elaborate for the reasons
considered in more detail hereafter.Firstly, for the video server to be feasible, the
storage of each video signal has to be distributed over a
number of separately controlled memories. Indeed, on the one
hand do state of the art memories and digital video coding
techniques not allow video signals exceeding a certain length
to be stored in a single such memory. On the other hand can
it also be verified from the article "System architecture for
a large scale video on demand service", by W. Sincoskie,
Computer Networks and ISDN Systems 22, 1991, 155-162, that
for "near video on demand" a better service, i.e. smaller
waiting times, is only possible by spreading the storage of
a video signal over a number of such memories. Secondly, to provide the "interactive video on
demand" service as defined in the first referenced article,
the server control means in the known video server needs to
handle not only a relatively large number of "interactive"
control signals but has also to react to them by controlling
each of the memory controllers accordingly. This control is
particularly complex when, as stated above, the storage of
the involved video signals is spread over various memories
and the known server control means further needs to map the
above control signals to the exact memory configuration in
use in the video server.Hence, from the above it may be concluded that,
when in the known video server the server control means is
kept relatively simple,
