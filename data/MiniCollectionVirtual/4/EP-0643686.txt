<DESCRIPTION>
New CompoundsField of the inventionThe present invention relates to novel derivatives of 3- hydroxya_nthranilic acid, 3-HANA, methods for their preparation, novel pharmaceutical compositions and the use thereof for inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxyanthranilate oxygenase, 3-HAO, responsible for the production of the endogenous neurotoxin quinolinic acid, QUIN.Background of the invention3-HAO is the enzyme in the catabolic pathway of tryptophan responsible for the conversion of 3-hydxoxyanthranilic acid into quinolinic acid. Both QUIN and its biosynthetic enzyme 3-HAO have been identified in rodent as well as in human brain tissue. QUIN is a potent exitoxin acting through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NT_DA); receptor and has recently gained attention for its putative role as a pathogen in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Hunting- ton's disease, stroke/cerebral ischemia, hypoxia, Alz¬ heimer's disease and the AIDS dementia complex. Inhibitors of 3-HAO activity are of obvious therapeutic interest in diseases which can be traced to an overabundance of guino- linic acid.Prior art4-halogenated substrate analogs have been described as inhibitors of 3-HAO activity. In 1980 ±t was shown by Parli CJ, Krieter P and Schmedt B, in "Metabolism of 6- chlorotryptophan to 4-chloro-3-hydroxy__nthranilic acid: A potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxyanthraniliLc acid oxidase", Arch Bioche and Biophys 203, pp 161-166, 1980, that 4- chloro-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, a me___bolite of 6-8UBSTITUTESHEET 

 chlorotryptophart, is a potent inhibitor of 3-HAO in rat and guinea pig liver and kidney. Later it was verified by Heyes MP, Hutto B and Markey SP, in "4-Chloro-3-hγdroxy- anthranilate inhibits brain 3-hydroxyanthranilate oxidase", Neurochem Int 13, pp 405-408, 1988, that 4- chloro-3-hydrox_τanthranilic acid also is an -inhibitor of rat brain 3-HAO. In 1989 Todd WP, Carpenter BK and Schwarcz R, in "Preparation of 4-halo-3- hydroxyanthranilates and demonstration of their inhibitio of 3-hydroxyant__xanilate oxygenase activity in rat and human brain tissue". Prep Bioche 19, pp 155-165, 1989, showed that 4-fluoro-, 4-chloro- and 4-bromo-3- hydroxyanthranilic acid had very similar blocking potencies of 3-HAO in rat as well as in human brain.Brief description of the inventionThe present invention relates to compounds able to inhibit the enzyme 3-HAO with I 5Q values superior to compounds according to the prior artThe present invention, thus, is related to a compound of the general formula Iwherein R 1 and R2 are the same or different and
