<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink suited
for ink-jet printers, and also to an ink-jet recording
process and apparatus that make a record on paper by
causing ink to fly from orifices of a recording head
by the action of energy, preferably heat
energy. More particularly, it relates to an ink-jet
recording process and apparatus that make a record on
non-coated paper such as paper for copying, paper for
reporting, notepaper, letter paper, bond paper and
computer printout paper (continuous business forms)
commonly used in offices and homes.Ink-jet recording systems have the advantages
that they make less noise in the course of recording
and a recorded image with a high resolution can be
obtained at a high speed because of use of a highly
integrated head. Inks used in such ink-jet recording
systems are those prepared by dissolving various kinds
of water-soluble dyes in water or in a mixed solution
of water and an organic solvent.When the water-soluble dyes are used, however,
light fastness of recorded images is often questioned 
because such water-soluble dyes have poor light
fastness by nature.Water fastness of recorded images is also
often questioned because the dye is water-soluble.
More specifically, if recorded images become wet with
rain, sweat, or water from food and drink, they may
become blurred or disappear.Meanwhile, light fastness and water fastness
are similarly questioned also in writing utensils
such as ball-point pens because water-soluble dyes are
mainly used, and various water-based pigment inks for
writing utensils have been proposed so that such
problems can be settled. Examples of studies on
dispersion stability, prevention of ink solidification
at pen points and prevention of ball wear of ball-point
pens for the purpose of putting water-based
pigment inks into practical use are seen in Japanese

of water-based pigment inks have become commercially
available. The DE-A-33 19 239 relates to a binder, at least a part of
which is neutralized with ammonia or a volatile organic
