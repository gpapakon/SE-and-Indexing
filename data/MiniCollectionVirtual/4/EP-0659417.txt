<ABSTRACT>
A method of inhibiting dysfunctional uterine 
bleeding-comprising administering to a human in need 

thereof an effective amount of a compound having the 
formula 


   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


or 

wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 

pyrrolidine, hexamethylenemino, and piperidino; or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is a common
clinical problem in gynecology. Any woman may be affected
during reproductive and later years. Dysfunctional
bleeding is characterized by menorrhagia (excessive
cyclical bleeding, greater than or equal to 80 ml/cycle)
(Gleesen et al., Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol, 48(3),
207-214 (1993)), metrorrhagia (abnormal frequency of
cycles), bleeding in addition to normal cycles, or bleeding
without normal cycles.Potential causes of abnormal bleeding are numerous, and
include physiological transition (e.g. menopause),
pregnancy, endometrial cancer, or fibromyomata, and thus
the diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding must be
made after careful investigation to exclude these other
causes (Galle et al., Postgrad Med, 93(2), 73-76 (1993)).In most cases, dysfunctional uterine
bleeding is associated with anovulation (Bayer et al.,
JAMA, 269(14), 1823-1828 (1993)). Anovulatory bleeding is
frequent in pubertal and perimenopausal phases, and is
physiological, probably related to changing estrogen levels
(Id.). However, bleeding may be caused by chronic
anovulation secondary to unopposed estrogen secretion which
causes endometrial proliferation, and is associated with
increased risk of endometrial cancer (Id.). Inappropriate
estrogen levels, either excess estrogen or estrogen
unopposed by appropriate progestagen (progesterone) levels,
are considered the likely cause of many cases of
dysfunctional uterine bleeding.Treatment of anovulatory bleeding is designed
generally to reduce bleeding, and more particularly to halt
acute bleeding, prevent recurrence of bleeding, and prevent
long-term complications (Id.). First treatment approaches
are medical, and the areas and limitations of options
available are tabulated. 
THERAPYOBJECTIVE(S)Limitation(s)1) GnRH AgonistsBlocks estrogen secretion at pituitary axis level• By injection• Accelerates osteoporosis• Limited to preoperative use• Side effects2) Cyclical Oral Progestagens,Corrects estrogen progestagen ratio• Limited effectiveness• Side effects3) Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory AgentsLocal endometrial actions• Limited effectiveness• Non-specific agent• Side effectsWhen these therapies fail, surgery is usually
indicated. Such surgery is usually either endometrial
ablation or hysterectomy, but these procedures are
associated with significant costs and side effects, (Thomas
et al., supra.; Perino, Acta Eur Ferti, 21(6), 313-317
(1990)) some with a failure rate up to 20% (Fraser, supra.;
Hellen, Histopathology,22(4), 361-365
