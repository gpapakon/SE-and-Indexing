<ABSTRACT>
A method, composition and test device for 
determining the ionic strength or specific gravity of a 

test sample are disclosed. The method utilizes a test 
device comprising a test pad, wherein the test pad 

includes a carrier matrix incorporating a reagent 
composition capable of producing a detectable and 

measurable response that correlates to the ionic 
strength, and therefore the specific gravity, of the 

test sample. The reagent composition, comprising a 
strong polyelectrolyte, a metachromatic indicator dye 

and a suitable carrier, is incorporated into a carrier 
matrix to provide a test pad of a device useful in an 

ionic strength assay or a semiquantitative specific 
gravity assay of a test sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method, 
composition and test device for determining the ionic 
strength or estimating the specific gravity of a test 
sample. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a method of assaying an aqueous test sample, 
such as urine, for ionic strength or specific gravity 
that: a) utilizes a reagent composition that undergoes 
a detectable or measurable response upon contact of the 
test sample with the reagent composition, and b) is 
essentially independent of test sample pH. The 
detectable response is proportional to the ionic 
strength of the test sample and can be correlated 
quantitatively to the ionic strength of the test sample 
and semiquantitatively to the specific gravity of the 
test sample. The reagent composition provides 
sufficient color differentiation between test samples 
to provide an assay for the ionic strength or specific 
gravity of the test sample. The specific gravity of a test sample, such 
as urine or serum, is a measure of the relative 
proportions of solid material dissolved in the test 
sample to the total volume of the test sample. In 
general, the specific gravity of a test sample is a 
measure of the relative degree of concentration or the 
relative degree of dilution of the test sample. The 
specific gravity of urine can be correlated to the 
ionic strength, or ion concentration, of the test 
sample. With regard to urine samples, the assay for 
specific gravity helps interpret the results of the 
other assays performed in a routine urinalysis. Clinically, under appropriate and 
standardized conditions of fluid restriction or  
 
increased fluid intake, the specific gravity of a urine 
sample measures the concentrating and diluting 
abilities of the kidneys of an individual. The 
specific gravity of urine ranges from about 1.005 to 
about 1.030, and usually is in the range from about 
1.010 to about 1.025. A specific gravity of about 
1.025 or above in a random first morning urine specimen 
indicates a normal concentrating ability of the 
kidneys. Either an abnormally low or an abnormally 
high urine specific gravity is clinically significant. 
Therefore, accurate and reliable specific gravity 
assays of urine and other aqueous test samples must be 
available for both laboratory and home use. The assays 
must provide an accurate measurement of abnormally low 
and abnormally high specific gravities, such that a 
correct diagnosis can be made and correct medical 
treatment implemented, monitored and maintained. For example,
