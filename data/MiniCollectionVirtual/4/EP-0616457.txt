<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of fixed stations (13, 23, 33) are provided which have different identifiers (A, D, B) and which are assigned to different areas (11, 21, 31) . The handsets (15) have one, two or more identifiers (A, B, C, D) and can in each case be operated in all the areas (11, 21, 31) in which one of their identifiers corresponds with the identifier of the respective fixed station (13, 23, 33). When a call is received from a fixed station (13, 23, 33), all stored identifiers (A, B, C, D) are compared successively in the called handset (15) with the identifier of the calling fixed station. If a correspondence is found, the complete connection set-up then takes place. When a call is made from a handset (15), only one of the stored identifiers (A, B, C, D) is in each case transmitted. That identifier which was the last found to correspond during an incoming call is preferred.
