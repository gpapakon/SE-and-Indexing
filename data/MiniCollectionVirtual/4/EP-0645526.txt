<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention relates to a system for facilitating
an oil change and an oil filter change in internal
combustion engines in a mainly automatic easy and fast manner
which comprises connecting means which is connected to
the oil outlet of the crankcase in substitution of the
conventional plug closing the motor oil outlet which connecting
means extends into a conduct, removable oil extraction
and refilling means being connectable to said conduct,
a support for the oil filter in which said filter is placed
remotely from its conventional position in an inverted vertical
position, said support being connected to the conventional
site of the oil filter bv a connecting plug and two
conducts allowing circulation of oil from the motor through
the remotely located oil filter.Presently, the change of oil and oil filters of combustion
engines is a quite cumbersome, untidy and slow procedure.
Thus, change of motor oil is generally done by
hand by unscrewing the outiet plug of the crankcase, letting
used oil run ot of said box by gravity until it is
empty, screwing said plug in again and refilling the motor
block through the corresponding inlet opening whilst change
of the oil filter is generally done by unscrewing it from
its position in the motor block which is generally not
located at an accessible site.These conventional manual procedures have the disadvantages
that they are slow, i.e., they take at least 15
minutes, require, in the case of motor vehicles, an elevator
or a service pit to have access to the oil outlet
plug of the crankcase, untidy because they always lead at
least to oil smearing the operator's hands and oil flowing
to the floor thereby causing serious pollution.Furthermore, refilling the motor block with oil
through the conventional upper oil inlet has the disadvantage 
that the oil being poured in rests for a certain
time on the inner portions of the motor before reaching the
oil box so that to achieve the correct filling oil level
implies awaiting that practically all oil has dropped into
the crankcase after various filling steps. This is even
slower than 15 minutes so that, in general, too little or
more too often too much oil is refilled which results not
only in a possible waste of oil but also to pollution as
the excess oil is unnecessarily burned or thrown out of
the engine.The convention manual oil filter change at its conventional
generally quite unaccessible location is, on
the one hand, slow and, on the other, a rather untidy job
as to reach the oil filter located at a site
