by hydrolyzation. The sol is applied to a glass plate. In a porous transparent activated film formed by baking the coated 

glass plate, there is provided a black matrix produced by oxidation and reduction of metal and having a total reflectivity 
of 6% or less and an optical density of 3.5 or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a glass substrate 
for liquid crystals for obtaining high-contrast TFT liquid crystal 
displays, which can completely interrupt unnecessary light of an 
area other than PIXEL electrodes of the liquid crystal panel, 
suppress TFT optical leak current, and depress nearly completely 
light reflection at a black matrix section, as well as to color 
filters for TFT liquid crystals, TFT liquid crystal displays for 
projection, and color TFT liquid crystal displays using the glass 
substrate for liquid crystals. In a color filter used for liquid crystal displays, it 
has been recommended to form black matrix with light-shielding 
film for filling up the space between pixels to have 
high-contrast images. Examples of such black matrix generally 
include the following. 
1. Using ink or photosensitizer containing black 
pigment, black matrix is formed in a portion to be shielded on a 
transparent substrate. 2. A metal thin film such as chromium is formed on 
the entire transparent substrate by sputtering or evaporation 
method, and thereafter resist to shield light is formed by 
applying photosensitive resist on the metal thin film, exposing  
 
through a mask, and developing, and unnecessary portions are 
removed by etching to form black matrix. However, the black matrix of the above 1 can 
suppress reflection of black matrix from the glass surface but 
the film thickness must be increased in order to achieve 
satisfactory light shielding effects. When the black matrix is 
printed with ink, satisfactory film thickness is unable to be 
obtained and it is difficult to suppress TFT optical leak current. 
It cannot form fine black matrix, neither. When photosensitizer 
is used to increase the film thickness, light does not penetrate 
inside the film which remains unexposed, due to the black color 
of the photosensitizer. When optical density of 3.5 or higher is 
intended to achieve, the black matrix film is too thick to 
maintain smoothness and becomes inadequate for assembling 
liquid crystal panels. The black matrix of the above 2 is formed by 
evaporation or sputtering method, but because these have 
metallic luster, reflection of black matrix when seen from the 
glass surface is extremely large as 59%, causing the panel 
contrast to markedly lower. In addition, these forming methods 
require expensive vacuum equipment, and if optical density 
exceeding 3.5 is intended to achieve, long-term treatment is 
required, resulting in extremely poor productivity and high 
costs.
