Front safety stop for a ski, comprising a movable element, e.g., jaws 
carried by a body (33), a pair of jaws (72) jointed to a cross-piece (73), a pair of 

independent, curved jaws (85), comprising a device for supporting the front of the boot 
with a movable sole-supporting plate (1), and guide means (24-13; 27, 18) independent 

of those of the movable element ensuring displacement of the support plate according to 
a predetermined path having a component traverse to the ski, the support plate being 

connected to the movable element by a connection piece (6, 9), characterized by the fact 
that the connection piece (6, 9) is elastically deformable, so that the support plate can 

move freely in a resilient manner on a weak course relative to a mean position which is 
imposed on it by the release movement of the movable elemen
t. 
Stop according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the connection piece (6, 
9) is a flexible tongue. 
Stop according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterized by the fact that the movable 
plate (1) can pivot laterally around an axis (Y, Z) centered on the ski and located beneath 

the boot.  
 
Stop according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that the means ensuring 
guidance for the pivoting of the movable plate (1) consist of a stationary cylindrical stub 

(25) which engages in a hole (13) in the plate (1). 
Stop according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that the means ensuring 
guidance for the pivoting of the movable plate (1) consist of a stationary rib (27) having 

a circular arc-shaped contour, which engages in a complementary groove (18) provided 
in said plate (1). 
Stop according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized by the fact that it is of the 
pivoting body (33) type carrying the retaining jaws (31) of the boot, and that the pivoting 

body (33) is solid with a substantially vertical rod (32), centered on the ski, and fastened 
to the connection piece (6) (Figures 1 to 6). 
Stop according to claims 2 and 6 taken in combination, characterized by the fact 
that the said rod (32) engages in a slot (60) provided in one of the ends of the flexible 

tongue (62), the same being connected, by its other end, to the movable plate (1). 
Stop according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized by the fact that it is of the 
type comprising a pair of jaws (72) articulated on a transversely movable cross-piece 

(73), and that this latter is connected to the said connection piece (6) (Figure 7).  
 
Stop according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized by the fact that it is of the 
type comprising a pair of independent, curved jaws (85) which are articulated on a 

stationary body (80) and each act on a central elastically-stressed slider (81), and that the 
support plate (1) is solid with a cam groove (19) which cooperates with a tracking piece 

(91), this latter being connected to said slider (81) by the said elastically-deformable 
connection piece (9) (Figures 8 and 9).
