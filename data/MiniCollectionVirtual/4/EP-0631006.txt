<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet printing method for effecting printing on a print 
medium (25) such as a sheet of cloth by applying a jet (24) of an ink 

(21) to 
the print medium. The print medium is formed by preparing a 

sheet of cloth containing a cationic substance, preparing a 
backing sheet having a layer of an adhesive agent, and bonding 

the sheet of cloth to the adhesive surface of the backing sheet. 
After the jet of ink is applied to the print medium, the sheet of 

cloth is peeled off from the backing sheet and the freed sheet of 
cloth is rinsed with rinsing water containing a cation blocking 

agent, followed by drying.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to printing on a
sheet of cloth and, more particularly, to an ink jet printing
method for printing information or a pattern on a sheet of cloth
using an ink jet printer, and also to a print medium suitable for
use in carrying out the printing method.In recent years, studies have been made with respect to
printing methods for ink jet printing that are more suitable for
small-lot production of a variety of types of products other than
ordinary printing methods such as screen printing and roller
printing. Ordinary ink jet printers used in offices or by
individuals are designed to print information on sheets of paper
or OHP sheets, and cannot be directly used for printing on a
variety of types of print mediums such as cloth or the like.
Namely, there are a lot of problems to be solved with respect to
using the known ink jet printing techniques for printing on media
such as sheets of cloth. The JP-A-068 372 discloses a method which comprises fixing a
fabric on an adhesive layer including migration-preventing
and adhesive components formed on a sheet.
This document also discloses the use of a fluorescent dye as
a coloring matter of dyeing in the printing liquid.
The JP-A-04 341 885 discloses a label paper for ink jet
printing, which paper comprises in lamination a base paper
including pulp and a filler, an adhesive layer and a
releasing paper. A cationic high-molecular electrolyte is
provided on a surface of the base paper. The cationic
electrolyte has the function to improve the water-fastness of
the printed image.The JP-A-62 268 682 discloses and ink jet recording sheet
comprising a base sheet and a coating layer containing a
pigment, a binder and a cationic polymer provided on the base
sheet. The cationic polymer is used to improve the water-fastness
of a recorded image.The EP-A-0 387 893 discloses an ink jet recording paper
comprising a base paper and an ink-receiving layer provided
on the base paper. A cationic polymer is contained in the
base paper to capture a dye in the ink, which passes through
the ink-receiving layer.The DE-A-3 640 359 discloses a recording medium comprising a
substrate and an ink-receiving layer containing a cationic
polymer provided on the substrate. In particular, ink jet printing on various types of cloth
require use of different types of inks because the optimum
structure and type of the colorant varies according to the kind
of the cloth. Inks which are used in ordinary office-use or
personal ink jet printers are designed to be suitable
