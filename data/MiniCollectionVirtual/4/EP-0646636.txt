<ABSTRACT>
Fluorine-containing, chiral and achiral liquid 
crystal compounds comprise (a) an aliphatic 

fluorocarbon terminal portion comprising a 
perfluorinated or partially-fluorinated alkylene group 

and a terminal hydrocarbon alkyl group, the groups 
optionally containing at least one catenary ether 

oxygen atom; (b) an aliphatic hydrocarbon terminal 
portion; and (c) a central core connecting the terminal 

portions. The compounds have smectic mesophases or 
latent smectic mesophases and are useful, for example, 

in liquid crystal display devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluorinated chiral
and achiral smectic liquid crystal compounds. These
compounds and mixtures of liquid crystal materials
containing these compounds are useful in a variety of
electrooptical displays.Devices employing liquid crystals have found
use in a variety of electrooptical applications, in
particular those which require compact, energy-efficient,
voltage-controlled light valves, e.g., watch and
calculator displays, as well as the flat-panel displays
found in portable computers and compact televisions.
Liquid crystal displays have a number of unique
characteristics, including low voltage and low power of
operation, which make them the most promising of the
non-emissive electrooptical display candidates currently
available. However, slow response and insufficient
nonlinearity can impose limitations for many potential
applications. The requirement for speed may become
especially important in proportion to the number of
elements which have to be addressed in a device. This
limits the potential use of some types of liquid
crystals.The modes of liquid crystal displays that are
most extensively employed at the present are twisted
nematic (TN), supertwisted birefringence effect (SBE),
and dynamic scattering (DS), all employing nematic or
chiral nematic (cholesteric) liquid crystals. These
devices are based upon the dielectric alignment effects
(Freedericksz effect) of the nematic and/or chiral 
nematic liquid crystal (or mixtures of nematic or chiral
nematic liquid crystals) upon application of an electric
field. The average molecular long axis of the liquid
crystal material takes up a preferred orientation in the
applied electric field, the orientation of which is
dependent on the sign of the dielectric anisotropy of the
material or mixture, and this orientation relaxes upon
removal of the applied electric field. This
reorientation and relaxation is slow, on the order of a
few milliseconds.Although nematic and chiral nematic liquid
crystals are the most extensively employed, there are
liquid crystal devices that employ more highly ordered
smectic liquid crystals. For example, materials with a
smectic A mesophase are useful in device applications, as
described by Crossland et al. in U.S. Pat. Nos.
4,411,494, 4,419,664, and 4,528,562, and by F. J. Kahn in
Appl. Phys. Lett. 22, 111 (1973). These devices are
based on the dielectric reorientation of the liquid
crystals, and response times are on the order of
milliseconds.Mixtures which exhibit a chiral smectic A
mesophase are also
