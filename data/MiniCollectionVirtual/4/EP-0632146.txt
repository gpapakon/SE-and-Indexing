<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making electrodeposited copper foils which are useful
in making printed circuit boards (PCBs). The
foils are characterized by a unique combination of properties, namely, matte-side raw
foil Rtm of about 4 to about 10 microns, an ultimate tensile strength measured at 23° C
in the range of about 55,000 to about 80,000 psi, an elongation measured at 23°C of
about 6% to about 25%, an ultimate tensile strength measured at 180°C in the range
of about 30,000 psi to about 40,000 psi, an elongation measured at 180°C of about
4% to about 15%, and a thermal stability of less than about -20%. The process
involves the use of an electrolyte solution having a chloride ion concentration in the
range of about 1.2 to about 4.5 ppm, an organic additive concentration in the range
of about 0.4 to about 20 ppm, at least one impurity at a concentration in the range
of about 0.01 to about 20 grams per liter, and a current density in the range of about
0.1 to about 3 A/cm2. Copper foil is supplied to PCB manufacturers in the form of laminates.
These laminates are formed by bonding the copper foil to a polymeric insulating
resin. The copper foil portion of the laminate is etched to form the conductive paths
of the PCB using processes known to those skilled in the art. The etched copper
conductive paths provide electrical connection between various portions of an
electronic device.The copper foil qualities that enable improved performance and
reliability are lower controlled profile (roughness), superior ductility, high tensile
strength, and thermal stability. The prior art suggests methods of making copper foils
having one or more of these attributes, but not all of them simultaneously.All of these attributes are essential for providing copper foils that are
fully acceptable to the PCB industry. For example, foils having profiles that are too
high result in laminates exhibiting glass fiber breakage, measles and embedded
copper. Foils having profiles that are too low result in laminates with insufficient
bond strength. Foils with low ductilities crack when temperature stressed. Thermally
unstable foils result in laminates that warp and twist when copper recrystallizes and
softens during heating. Foils with low tensile strengths wrinkle during handling. The
foils of the present invention overcome all of these problems.The trend in the PCB industry is to use thinner laminates made with
thinner foils and less resin. These laminates are often processed at higher temperatures
than heretofore.
