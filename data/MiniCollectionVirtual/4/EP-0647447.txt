<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical preparation comprising at least 
one compound selected from the group consisting of 

carbostyril derivatives having the general formula: 

wherein R¹ is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group optionally 
having hydroxy group as a substituent; R² is a phenyl(lower 

alkyl) group optionally having 1 to 3 substituents selected 
from the group consisting of a lower alkoxy group and a 

halogen atom on the phenyl ring, pyridyl(lower alkyl) 
group, or a group of the formula -A-NR³R⁴ (wherein A is a 

lower alkylene group, R³ and R⁴ are the same or different 
and represent a lower alkyl group or phenyl group), and a 

salt thereof, which is useful as an agent for treating 
thrombosis, more particularly, as an agent for inhibiting 

platelet aggregation, an agent for platelet aggregate 
dissociation, an ameliorant of cerebral circulation and a 

phosphodiesterase inhibitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a carbostyril derivative or a salt
thereof for the preparation of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of
disorders induced by decrease of c-AMP.A carbostyril derivative having the general
formula (1):

wherein R1 is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group optionally
having hydroxy group as a substituent; R2 is a phenyl (lower
alkyl) group optionally having 1 to 3 substituents selected
from the group consisting of a lower alkoxy group and a
halogen atom on the phenyl ring, pyridyl(lower alkyl)
group, or a group of the formula -A-NR3R4 (wherein A is a
lower alkylene group, R3 and R4 are the same or different
and represent a lower alkyl group or phenyl group), or a
salt thereof, is a known compound which is described in,
for example, EP Publication No. 355583 to be useful as
cardiotonics. These compounds are also known to be useful 
as antihistamines (Japanese Patent First Publication No.
8319/1981). In addition, among the compounds represented
by the above general formula, 6-[3-(3,4-dimethoxybenzylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-2-(1H)-quinoline
compound (the
compound of the formula (1) wherein R1 is hydrogen, R2 is
3,4-dimethoxybenzyl group; OPC-18790) has an inotropic
activity and is useful as an agent for treating heart
failure (The Japanese Journal of Pharmacology, The 64th
Annual Meeting, March 1991, Kobe, Japan and International
Congress of New Drug Development, Aug. 1991, Seoul, Korea).JP-A-57014574 discloses carbostyril derivate having inhibitory action on blood
platelet agglutination, inhibitory action on phosphodiesterase, antiulcer action,
cardiotonic action, and anti-inflammatory action.The present invention relates to the use of carbostyril derivatives having the
general formula:

wherein
R1  is hydrogen or a C1-6 alkyl group optionally having hydroxy group as
a substituent ;  R2is a phenyl(C1-6 alkyl) group optionally having 1 to 3 substituents
selected from the group consisting of a C1-6 alkoxy group and a
halogen atom on the phenyl ring, pyridyl(C1-6 alkyl) group, or a group
of the formula: -A-NR3R4 (wherein A is a C1-6 alkylene group, R3 and
R4 are the same or different and represent a C1-6 alkyl group or
phenyl group), or a salt thereof for the preparation of a medicament
for the prevention or treatment of disorders induced by decrease of
c-AMP wherein said disorders are selected from the. group consisting of
cancer, bronchial and allergic asthma, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, psychosis,
and psoriasis.The phosphodiesterase inhibitor used in the present
