<ABSTRACT>
A vessel for conducting blood cell agglutination 
assays is disclosed. A barrier retains reactants in an 

upper chamber during incubation, then, in response to a 
force, permits reagents to enter a lower chamber 

containing a matrix for separating agglutination.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of agglutination
assays, and particularly to vessels useful for conducting
agglutination assays and separating agglutinates.Blood group serology requires the determination of
blood cell compatibility between a blood donor and patient
recipient before a transfusion or organ transplant
involving the patient. Blood cell compatibility is
determined by the absence of immunological reaction
between antibodies contained in the blood serum of a
patient and antigens present on blood cells from the
donor.Many different blood group antigens are found on the
surface of red blood cells of every individual. Blood
grouping is generally the process of testing red cells to
determine which antigens are present and which are absent.
This is generally accomplished by using antibodies of
known specificity.For detecting antibodies in the serum or plasma of a
patient, reagents containing blood cells having known
antigens are mixed with a serum sample. The reactants are
incubated for a period of time sufficient to permit
agglutination of the red blood cells, which occurs when
antibodies against those antigens are present. The
mixture is then centrifuged, and if agglutinated blood
cells are present, such agglutinates are clearly visible
at the bottom of the reaction vessel, thus indicating the
presence of antibodies in the sample directed against the
known antigens on the red blood cells. If no antibodies 
are present in the sample directed against the known
antigens on the red blood cells, agglutination does not
occur, and this is indicated by the absence of agglutinated
red cells after centrifugation.Recently, systems have been developed in which the
agglutination reaction is carried out in one portion of a
vessel, and separation of agglutinated red cells is
accomplished in another portion of the same vessel using a
matrix which separates agglutinated cells from other
components in the reagent/sample mixture. One such system
is disclosed and described in European Patent Application
No. 0 485 228.
Similar systems are furthermore described in WO-A-9 216 294
and US-A-3 750 645.Agglutination reaction and separation vessels which are
useful in the inventions disclosed in the aforementioned
applications are manufactured and sold by Ortho Diagnostic
Systems Inc. Raritan, New Jersey, under the trademark
BIOVUE™. Such reaction vessels are in the form of a column
having an upper chamber and a lower chamber wherein the
upper chamber is of a wider diameter than the lower chamber.
The lower chamber
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vessel for conducting an agglutination assay
comprising a first chamber for receiving and retaining

fluid sample and reagents; a second chamber communicating
with the first chamber for receiving fluid from the first

chamber; and a barrier separating the first and second
chambers to prevent fluid passage from the first to the

second chamber under normal gravity and atmospheric pressure,
while allowing fluid passage from the first chamber to the

second chamber under a gravity or pressure which is greater
than normal gravity or atmospheric pressure;

   characterised in that the barrier comprises an aperture with a
circumference having a crimp

for reducing the cross-sectional area of the aperture, the aperture
being small enough to retain

the fluid in the first chamber under normal gravity and
atmospheric pressure.
A vessel according to claim 1 wherein the first chamber
comprises an insert (2) which provides the barrier and aperture (1).
A vessel according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
vessel is mounted on a cassette.
A vessel according to any one of the preceding claims
wherein the crimp is formed by impact extrusion in which the

vessel is impacted just beneath the first chamber.
A vessel according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein
the second chamber contains a matrix for separating

agglutinates from non agglutinates.
A vessel according to claim 5 wherein the matrix
comprises glass beads.
A vessel according to claim 5 or claim 6 wherein the
crimp is formed after insertion of the matrix into the

second chamber. 
A vessel according to any one of the preceding claims
wherein the crimp comprises a single pair of constrictive

points.
A vessel according to claim 8 wherein an internal
distance between the pair of constrictive points is in the

range of 0.010 to 0.050 inches (0.254-1.27mm).
A vessel according to claim 9 wherein the internal
distance is 0.020 inches (0.508mm).
