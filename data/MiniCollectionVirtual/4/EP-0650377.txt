<ABSTRACT>
Methods are disclosed for the alleviation of movement disorders via the implantation of static devices which focally release neuroinhibitory compounds to preselected brain areas. Pathological conditions to be treated by these methods include parkinsonian movement disorders, Huntington's chorea, and epileptiform seizure activity. In the treatment of parkinsonism, target areas implantation include the subthalamic nucleus, the globus pallidus internus, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. In the treatment of epilepsy, implants may be placed in an epileptogenic focus area of neural over-activity. The devices may be polymeric implants that release neuroinhibitory compounds such as GABA, GABA agonists, GABA potentiators, action potential blockers and voltage dependent calcium channel blockers, and glutamate antagonists. Alternatively, the devices may contain living cells which secrete neuroinhibitory compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The technical field of this invention is the alteration
of neuronal activity by implanting in preselected brain
sites devices which focally release neuro-inhibitory
compounds. Candidate movement disorders for this
treatment include Parkinson's disease, Huntington's
chorea, epilepsy, and pain relief.Neuroinhibitory compounds include the inhibitory neurotransmitters
gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) and in
some cases dopamine. Neurotransmitters are small
molecules (usually less than 1 kilodalton (kD)
molecular weight) which act as chemical means of 
communication between neurons. They are synthesized by
the presynaptic neuron and released into the synaptic
space where they then act on receptors specific for
that particular neurotransmitter on postsynaptic
neurons. GABA is considered a general inhibitory
neuro-transmitter, since receptors for GABA have been
identified in every brain region studied to date
(Krnjevic, K., 1991, IN: GABA Mechanisms in Epilepsy,
Wiley-Liss, pp.47-87).Paralysis agitans, more commonly known as Parkinson's
disease, is characterized by a deficiency of the neuro-transmitter,
dopamine, within the striatum of the
brain, secondary to the destruction of dopamine
secreting cells of the substantia nigra. The loss of
these dopamine secreting cells disrupts the normal
activity pattern of certain neural pathways through the
basal ganglia to the thalamus. It is postulated that
one result of these alterations in basal ganglia
activity is an increase in the activity of certain
neurons inhibitory to the thalamus, thereby decreasing
excitatory stimulus from the thalamus to the motor
cortex. For normal movement, excitatory thalamic
signals are required to modulate signals from the motor
cortex to the muscles of the body. Subjects with
parkinsonian symptoms display movement disorders
including stiffness and slowness of movement and
rhythmic tremor of limbs.These clinical symptoms can be improved by the systemic
administration of dopamine precursors such as levodopa
(L-dopa) (Calne et al. (1969) Lancet ii:973-976), or
dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine (Caine et al.
(1974) Bri. Med. 3. 9:442-444) and (+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynapthoxacine
(de Yebenes et al. (1987) Movement
Disorders 2:291-299), all of which are able to cross
the blood-brain barrier. Dopamine, itself, cannot be 
administered systemically because of its inability to
cross the blood-brain barrier. It has been discovered
and disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,892,538 that localized
delivery of dopamine to the striatum can alleviate
certain
