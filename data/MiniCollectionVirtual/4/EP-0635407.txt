<ABSTRACT>
A safety belt arrangement for motor vehicles has a winding roll (11) which is acted upon by a winding spring (12), a locking device (16) and a tensioning device (17). The tensioning device (17) is composed of a tensioning disc (18) having a central aperture (19) which has an internal ring gear (20) and surrounds, at a distance, a gearwheel (21) which is connected to the winding roll (11) so as to rotate with the latter. The fact that the tensioning disc (18) is releasably connected to the casing (23) makes it possible, when a pyrotechnical drive (14) is initiated by a sensor (48), for a load cable (22), which extends from the drive (24) to the tensioning disc (18), initially to release the tensioning disc (18) from the casing (28) and then to bring the internal ring gear (20) into engagement with the gearwheel (21) and in so doing to transmit to the winding roll (11) a rotary movement which is necessary for the tensioning of the safety belt (14). Means (25, 28, 29) secure the engagement of the internal ring gear (20) and the gearwheel (21).

<CLAIMS>
Safety belt arrangement for motor vehicles comprising a 
belt (14) held at at least two and preferably three 

points of the chassis (13) and capable of being resiliently 
wound up on a winding reel (11) which is journalled 

on the chassis (13) and biased in the winding up 
direction by a drive device such as a winding spring 

(12), with the belt being capable of being placed around 
the person to be secured and comprising a belt lock (15) 

for the purpose of selective opening and closing, with 
the belt reel (11) being abruptly rotatable in the event 

of accident-dependent accelerations by a tensioner device 
(17) by an amount in the winding up direction such 

that the belt (14), which is only loosely laid against 
the secured person by the drive device (12), is brought 

into firm contact with the secured person and can be 
blocked in the unwinding direction by a blocking device 

(16) when a jolt-like drawing out of the belt (14) or 
accident-dependent accelerations occur, with the tensioner 

device (17) including a tensioner disc (18) which 
is preferably releasably secured to the housing (23) opposite 

to one end face of the winding reel (11) and 
which has a central opening (19) with an inner toothed 

rim (20) provided at least preferably over a part of its 
periphery and surrounding a gearwheel (21) rotationally 

fixedly connected to the winding reel (11) at a distance 
such that the inner toothed rim (20) does not engage the 

gearwheel (21) in the rest position, and with a flexible 
draw element (22) which can be drawn off abruptly by a 

preferably pyrotechnically operated drive triggerable 
when accident-dependent accelerations occur, being wound 

onto the tensioner disc (18) in such a way that it is  
 

released from the housing (23) on triggering of the 
drive (24), the inner toothed rim (20) comes into engagement 

with the gearwheel (21) and the winding reel 
(11) is rotated in the belt winding up direction, and 

wherein means (25, 28, 29) are provided for maintaining 
the engagement of the inner toothed rim (20) in the 

gearwheel (21), characterised in that the winding reel 
(11) and the tensioner disc (18) are arranged concentrically 

to one another after the inner toothed rim (20) 
and the gearwheel (21) have come into engagement with 

one another. 
Safety belt arrangement in accordance with claim 1, 
characterised in that the tensioner disc (18) can be 

pivoted, from the occurrence of a predetermined tension 
force on the draw element (22) onwards, about a axle 

(27) intended to break lying at least substantially diametrically 
opposite to the tangential run-in point (26) 

to an extent such that the inner toothed rim (20) can 
enter into engagement with the gearwheel (21); and in 

that after the entry into engagement of the inner 
toothed rim (20) and the gearwheel (21), the axis of desired 

fractures (27) fractures with the continuance and 
in particular with an increase of the predetermined tension 

force, with the means (25, 28, 29) for maintaining 
the engagement of the inner toothed rim (20) into the 

gearwheel (21) maintaining the rotationally fixed engagement 
between the inner toothed rim (20) and the 

gearwheel (21) during the following joint rotation of 
the tensioner disc (18) and the winding reel (11), with 

the inner toothed rim (20) preferably extending over 
only part of the circumference where the engagement with 

the toothed gearwheel (21) occurs.  
 
Safety belt arrangement in accordance with claim 2, 
characterised in that the tensioner disc (18) is releasably 

held at the housing (23) by at least one shear 
pin (30) supported on the housing and by the axis of desired 

fracture (27), which - on triggering of the drive 
(24) - breaks earlier than the axle (27) intended to 

break. 
Safety belt arrangement in accordance with claim 2 and 
claim 3, characterised in that the shear pin (30) is 

provided at a clear spacing from the axle (27) intended 
to break and preferably generally diametrically opposite 

thereto. 
Safety belt arrangement in accordance with one of the 
claims 2 to 4, characterised in that the axis of desired 

fracture (27) is formed as a shear pin. 
Safety belt arrangement in accordance with one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the means for 

maintaining the engagement of the inner toothed rim (20) 
into the gearwheel (21) includes a clamping wedge (25), 

which becomes narrower opposite to the unwinding direction 
of the draw element and which, after the inner 

toothed rim has entered into engagement with the gearwheel 
(21), clamps within a region (32) displaced circumferentially 

relative to this engagement region (31) 
between the outer circumference of the central opening 

(19) and the teeth of the gearwheel (21). 
Safety belt arrangement in accordance with claim 6, 
characterised in that a circumferential region (32) adjoins 

the partial inner toothed rim (20) in the pull-out 
direction of the draw element and, after the inner 

toothed rim (20) has entered into engagement with the  
 

gearwheel (21), has a shape substantially complementary 
to the clamping wedge (25). 
Safety belt arrangement in accordance with claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that in the rest position the clamping 

wedge (25) is accommodated with a small spacing in a recess 
(33) of the central opening (19) while surrounding

Safety belt arrangement in accordance with one of the 
claims 6 to 8, characterised in that the means for maintaining 

the engagement of the inner toothed rim (20) 
into the gearwheel (21) includes a guide projection (28) 

which, in the rest position, stands in generally radial 
alignment with the inner toothed rim (20) and, after the 

inner toothed rim (20) has entered into engagement with 
the gearwheel (21), comes radially into sliding engagement 

with a circumferential guide surface (29) of the 
tensioner disc (18) from the outside in such a way that 

the inner toothed rim (20) and the gearwheel (21) are

preceding claims, characterised in that a tooth of the 

inner toothed rim (20), preferably the tooth lying next 
to the axis of desired fracture (27), is formed as a 

control tooth (35) in such a way that this tooth first 
enters into engagement with a tooth of the gearwheel 

(21) on a displacement or pivoting of the tensioner disc

between the outer periphery of the tensioner disc (18) 
and the rim (63) of the housing at the side of the axis 

of rotation (51) remote from the inner toothed rim (20) 
and has an extent in the radial direction such that, after 

the inner toothed rim (20) has entered into engagement 
with the gearwheel (21), the outer periphery of the 

tensioner disc (18) is slidingly supported on the said 
housing rim (63) and thus the gearwheel (21) is at least 

largely relieved from the radial forces which occur during 
a triggering.
