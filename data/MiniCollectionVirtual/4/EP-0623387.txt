A process of selective hydrogenation of a charge of unsaturated acetylenic or aromatic or dienic
hydrocarbons in the presence of a catalyst containing at least one substrate at least one metal of group

VIII selected from Platinum, Palladium and Nickel and at least one additional metal M selected from the
group formed by Germanium, Tin, Lead, Titanium, Iron, Molybdenum, Tungsten and Rhenium and the

catalyst being prepared from a calcined catalytic mass called precatalyst loaded into an industrial reactor
or industrial pre-reactor and activated by way of reduction within the reactor, mass containing at least

one substrate and at least one metal of group VIII into which mass the additional metal M has been
introduced by way of contacting the mass with at least one organic compound of at least one additional

metal M in a pure or diluted form, in-situ, in the reaction zone, where the treatment of the charge will
occur in the presence of said catalyst or in a pre-reaction zone directly in contact with the reaction zone,

said introduction being achieved in reducing atmosphere and the catalyst containing the group VIII metal
and the additional metal M being activated by way of reduction within the reactor
A process according to claim 1. wherein the catalyst is prepared according to a process comprising the sequence
of the following steps:


(a) in a first step of said preparation, a precatalyst is prepared off site containing at least said substrate and at
least said metal of group VIII, the precatalyst being at this stage subjected to a drying, and to a calcination,
(b) the precatalyst is introduced into a reaction zone where the charge to be treated will be sent by said catalyst
or into a prereaction zone directly connected to said reaction zone,
(c) the precatafyst is then subjected to a treatment of activation in reducing atmosphere
and,
(d) in a second step of said preparation, said additional metal M is introduced into the precatalyst, by contact
under reducing atmosphere of at least one organic compound of additional metal M.
A process according to claim 2, wherein the precatalyst is subjected to a drying and calcination before being activated
in the reaction zone or the prereactor zone.
A process according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the charge and the hydrogen are put in contact with
the catalyst at a temperature between 25 and 500°C, an absolute pressure of 0.1 to 10 MPa, with a space velocity

between 0.5 and 50 volumes of liquid charge per hour per volume of catalyst.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the substrate is selected from the refractory oxides.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the catalyst also contains at least one oxygen-sulfur family
element.

A process according to one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the catalyst contains at least one halogen selected from the
group formed by chlorine and fluorine. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the organic compound of additional metal M is introduced in
liquid phase or in gaseous phase.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the organic compound of additional metal M is introduced in
the catalyst in at least one impregnation solvent which is a hydrocarbon solution.
A process according to one of claims 1 to 10, wherein the activation of the precatalyst is achieved in reducing
atmosphere, in the presence of hydrogen between 20 and 600°C.
A process according to one of claims 10 and 11, wherein at the end of the preparation of the catalyst (before putting
the charge to be treated in contact with the catalyst), the elimination of the impregnation solvent of additional metal

is performed, then a heat treatment is performed.
A process according to claim 12, wherein said heat treatment is performed under flow of hydrogen, at a temperature
between 300 and 600°C.
A process according to one of claims 9 to 13, wherein additional metal M is introduced in the precatalyst in the form
of at least one organometallic or alcoholate compound.
