<ABSTRACT>
A sorption pump for high vacuum applications that 
is suited for use in gas analyzers such as mass 

spectrometers. The pump includes a housing containing a 
quantity of getter material and a diffusion barrier in the 

gas inlet to the housing. A finite period of time is 
required for gas molecules in the vacuum analyzer system 

to cross the barrier, thus providing a window during which 
gas pulses can be accurately analyzed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sorption pump with the 
features of the preamble of claim 1. A sorption or getter pump is described in U.S. 
patent 3,961,897 which issued to Giorgi et al. Getter 
pumps of this type are well known in the art and are used 
to establish and maintain a vacuum within a vessel. As 
noted by Giorgi et al. the sorptive material used in the 
pump may be selected from any number of non-evaporable 
getter materials that are suitable for pumping various gas 
molecules from the vessel in order to maintain the vessel 
at a desired vacuum pressure. Giorgi et al., in a later U. S. patent 4,088,456, 
discloses a pumping system which, in its simplest form, is 
a cylindrical tube that is connected to a vacuum chamber. 
The internal surface of the tube is coated with a non-evaporable 
getter material characterized as having a 
sorptive capacity for certain gases at vapor pressures 
less than 10-5 torr. Suitable non-evaporable getter 
materials for this purpose are disclosed as Zv, Ti, Ta, 
Nb, V and mixtures thereof with other metals such as Al. Sorption pumps containing getter materials absorb 
gas molecules either physically or through chemical 
reaction wherein the molecules are either captured on the 
material surface or dissolved into the material. In any 
event, the molecules are "pumped" from the vacuum chamber 
to maintain the chamber at a desired vacuum pressure. In 
the case of non-evaporating getters, the pump is able to 
form chemical compounds with most gases and thus can be 
used for a number of different applications. Conventional sorption pumps, however, are not 
suitable for use in conjunction with gas analyzers and, in 
particular, in mass spectrometers. Common to all sorption 
pumps is the fact that the pumping speed, that is, the 
sorption speed of the getter material, is dependent on 
such variables as the getter material that is employed,  
 
the getter material history, the pump temperature, and the 
gas loading. The pumping speed can, and usually does, 
change dramatically with time and usage. In gas analysis 
equipment such as mass spectrometers, it is essential that 
one be able to accurately measure the partial pressure of 
a gas or gases involved. The partial pressure of a gas is 
expressed in terms of gas flow divided by pumping speed. 
Where the pumping speed is unknown or cannot be accurately 
determined, as in the case of a conventional getter pump, 
the gas flow also cannot be accurately evaluated 
quantitatively and the partial pressure cannot be 
determined.

<CLAIMS>
A sorption pump for use in high vacuum applications, that 
includes, an enclosed housing containing a quantity of 

sorption material (15), said housing having an inlet (21), 
connecting means (16, 17, 18) for attaching the housing 

to a vacuum vessel (12) whereby gas contained in the vessel 
can communicate with the sorption material through said 

inlet, diffusion means (25) mounted in the inlet to said 
housing through which gas molecules pass during a finite 

period of time before being captured by said sorption material, 
characterized in that said diffusion means is a frit 

made of a material selected from a group of materials consisting 
of ceramics, glass, plastic or metal. 
The sorption pump of claim 1, wherein said sorptive material 
is a non-evaporating getter material. 
The sorption pump of claim 1 or 2, wherein the getter material 
is a finely ground particulate. 
The sorption pump of claim 1 or 2, wherein the sorption 
material is in the form of compressed pellets. 
The sorption pump of one or more of the preceding claims, 
wherein the frit contains the getter material within the 

housing. 
The sorption pump of one or more of the preceding claims, 
further including a retaining means (28) for supporting 

the frit within the inlet of said housing.  
 
The sorption pump of one or more of the preceding claims, 
wherein the connecting means is a removable mounting flange 

(16) for connecting the housing to said vessel whereby the 
housing can be quickly replaced after the sorption material 

is exhausted.
