Method for purifying an aqueous solution of raw
albumin wherein contaminant proteins are bound by

chromatography to a stationary solid phase, the purified
albumin solution being collected as an effluent,


characterized in that
 a neutral phase, or one in the
region of neutrality, charged with at least one compound

chosen from the group formed by compounds containing C
3

to C
8
 alkyl radicals and compounds containing sulfate
groups is chosen as the stationary phase.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the stationary phase is a neutral particulate
material the particles of which have an average size of

less than 2 mm, preferably between 1 µm and 2 mm, and 
in
that
 the chromatography is carried out on at least one
column.
Method according to either of Claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that
 the raw aqueous solution of albumin
is obtained from human blood plasma by a known process,

according to which the said plasma is fractionated by
successive treatments by modifying the temperature and by

the action of a precipitation agent in order to arrive,
after at least partial separation of the factors VIII and

IX and of the γ-globulins, at albumin solutions
containing the precipitation agent, which are dialysed in

order to extract precipitation agent and to collect the

raw albumin solution.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the albumin solution to be purified
has a raw albumin concentration of between 1 g and 300 g

per liter and has a pH of between 6 and 8, preferably
between 6.9 and 7.1.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the compound containing C
3
 to C
8

alkyl radicals is a compound containing butyl radicals.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the compound containing sulfate
groups is a dextran sulfate. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that
 the aqueous solution of raw albumin
is subjected to at least two chromatographies, at least

one being a chroma tography on a stationary phase charged
with a compound containing C
3
 to C
8
 alkyl radicals and at
least one other being a chromatography on a stationary

phase charged with a compound containing sulfate groups.
Method according to Claim 7, 
characterized in
that
 the raw albumin solution is first subjected to one
(or more) chromatography (or chromatographies) on a

stationary phase charged with a compound containing
sulfate groups, followed by one (or more) chromatography

(or chromatographies) on a stationary phase charged with
C
3
 to C
8
 alkyl radicals.
Method according to either of Claims 7 and 8,

characterized in that
 the raw aqueous solution of albumin
is subjected to a chromatography on a stationary phase

charged with compounds containing C
3
 to C
8
 alkyl radicals,
before and after a chromatography on a stationary phase

charged with a compound containing sulfate groups, or
vice versa.
Method according to one of Claims 7 to 9,

characterized in that
 the effluent from a first
chromatography is used directly to supply the following

chromatography.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 10,

characterized in that
 the chromatography flow rate is
between 1 and 30 cm/hour.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 11,

characterized in that
 the chromatography temperature is
between 1 and 30°C.
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 12,

characterized in that
, before subjecting the aqueous
solution of raw albumin to a chromatography on a

stationary phase charged with compounds containing C
3
 to
C
8
 alkyl radicals, the corresponding column(s) is (are)
equilibrated with an aqueous saline solution having at

most 10 times the ionic strength of the albumin solution
to be treated. 
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 12,

characterized in that
, before subjecting the aqueous
solution of raw albumin to a chromatography on a

stationary phase charged with a compound containing
sulfate groups, the corresponding column(s) is (are)

equilibrated with a saline solution which is at most
isotonic relative to the albumin solution to be treated.
Method according to either of Claims 13 and 14,

characterized in that
 a sodium chloride solution or a
phosphate buffer is used to equilibrate the column(s).
