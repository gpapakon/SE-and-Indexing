<ABSTRACT>
An electronic circuit assembly with improved 
heatsinking is provided. The assembly includes a 

component carrying board (56) which has an opening (62) 
through it. The opening is sized to receive a heat 

generating electronic component (64). A diamond layer 
(50) is attached as a heat sink to the bottom (58) of the 

component carrying board. The heat generating component 
(64) is attached directly to the diamond layer (50), 

through the opening (62) in the component carrying board 
(56). The diamond layer provides electrical insulation 

as well as superior heat dissipation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to
electronic circuit assemblies, and more particularly to
electronic circuit assemblies having improved heatsinking
capabilities.Modern electronic circuit assemblies include high
power analog and digital semiconductor devices which
inherently generate a great deal of heat. The heat
generated by the components must be dissipated during
operation in order to maintain acceptable operation
temperatures.Conventionally, electronic components are mounted
on printed circuit boards. Printed circuit boards are
not good heatsinks, but provide the electrical insulation
necessary for electronic circuit operation, and provide a
substrate for printed circuits connecting the various
components. In order to dissipate heat, the conventional
printed circuit boards are typically mounted on metal,
e.g. copper, heatsinks which will draw the heat from the
circuit board.In analog electronics, as frequencies and power
increase as required by modern telecommunications for
example, the above described heatsinking arrangement is
not sufficient to maintain operable temperatures. The
same problem arises in digital electronics for example
with high performance microprocessors. A prior art
solution is to isolate the particular components
generating the most heat, and attach them separately to
the metal heatsink which lies below the printed circuit 
board. This is accomplished by providing an opening through the printed
circuit board, the opening accessing the metal heatsink.The heat generating component can not be attached directly to the
metal heatsink because it must be attached to an electrically insulating
substrate. Consequently, the heat generating component is first attached to a
ceramic substrate. The ceramic substrate is then attached to the metal
heatsink, through the opening in the printed circuit board. For example, see
Japanese patent application no. JP-A-61-214455. As another example, see
pages 36, 494 and 512-513 of "Microelectronics Packaging Handbook" edited
by R. Tummala et al. and published by Van Nostrand Reinhold in 1988.The prior art solution gives rise to particular disadvantages. For
example, the ceramic substrate between the heat generating component and
the heatsink does not dissipate heat particularly well. Ceramics have
approximately 1/100 the heat dissipation ability compared to copper.
Consequently, although operable temperatures can be maintained, there will
be localized heat gradients, the heat being high near the heat generating
component mounted on the
