<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of 
application Serial No. 07/842,838 filed February 27, 1992 and 
application Serial No. 07/842,839 filed February 27, 1992. This invention relates to plastic containers and 
particularly to plastic containers made of post consumer resin. In the use of plastic materials for containers such 
as bottles, it has been found desirable to attempt to recycle 
and reuse the plastic which is commonly known as post consumer 
plastic (PCP) or post consumer resin (PCR). In attempts to make 
containers from such materials, it has been found that the 
properties have been adversely affected. Specifically, when containers are made from post 
consumer high density polyethylene homopolymers (HDPE) container 
scrap, it has been found that the containers have diminished 
physical properties and particularly diminished resistance to 
stress cracking. Such containers made of high density 
polyethylene homopolymers also have been used for packaging of 
certain types of liquid detergent products. The use of such 
containers to package liquid detergent products has been somewhat 
restricted, however, by reason of the fact that many types of 
liquid detergent products accelerate the tendency of the container 
to exhibit stress cracking. Stress cracking is evidenced by the 
appearance of hazy cracks in the container which are aesthetically  
 
unpleasing to the ultimate consumer. In extreme cases, stress 
cracking can lead to leakage of the contents from the container. 
Stress cracking can occur when the containers are for liquid 
products including liquid detergents and liquid hypochlorite 
bleaches. It has been suggested that such post consumer resin 
be utilized because large quantities of high density polyethylene 
post consumer resin are available due to the extensive use of 
high density polyethylene in large containers for milk and water. 
Post consumer resin from such containers contains contaminants 
of paper and other plastic resins, for example, from closures 
such that it has been generally thought that it can not be used 
to make satisfactory plastic containers. In copending application Serial No. 07/842,938, filed 
February 27, 1992, a plastic container is made from a fusion 
blend of a post consumer resin and ethylene polymers comprising 
post consumer resin of homopolymer high density polyethylene 
plastic and virgin high density polyethylene copolymer resin. 
The physical properties of the container including stress crack 
resistance are maintained as contrasted to the
