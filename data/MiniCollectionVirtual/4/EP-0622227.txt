<ABSTRACT>
A leaf plate (7) is disposed in abutment, through 
a guide path (33) of printing paper (P), with a 

feed roller (6) whose 
peripheral surface is in contact with the guide path (33). 

The printing paper is transported by the feed roller 
rotationally driven while the printing paper is pressed 

against the feed roller by the leaf plate (7). In the 
course of transportation of the printing paper (P), the 

printing paper (P) fed by the feed roller is guided along a 
flat paper guide surface (8), and printing is performed by 

having ink jetted from a nose portion (4) of an ink jet head (3) 
to the printing paper (P) being guided as described above. 

Immediately before the printing position in the guide 
path (33), there are disposed a plurality 

of projections (11,12,15) in 
contact with the guide path (33) and at predetermined 

intervals in the direction transverse to the printing 
paper (P). By bringing the transported printing paper into 

contact with the projections (11,12,15), the amplitude of 
undulations continuously produced in the printing paper (P) 

in the direction transverse to the paper is reduced. 
Thus, the distance between the nose portion (4) of the ink 

jet head (3) and the printing paper (P) in the printing position 
is made uniform and the quality of printing is improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet printer of
a structure in which recording paper is transported
through rotation of a feed roller while the paper is
pressed against the feed roller by a leaf plate.As conventional ink jet printers widely in use, there
are those of a type as shown in Fig, 10, in which, while
a carrier 2 with an ink jet head 3 mounted thereon is
moved in the direction transverse to printing paper P,
which is transported by a paper feed mechanism 5
along a paper guide surface 8, ink is jetted from a nose
portion 4 of the ink jet head 3 and printing is thereby
performed. More specifically, an ink jet head 3 of a serial
type is used and a desired image is formed on the printing
paper P through main scanning performed by having
such an ink jet head 3 moved by a head slide
mechanism, not shown, and sub-scanning performed
by having the printing paper P transported by the paper
feed mechanism 5. In the example shown in Fig. 10, the
paper feed mechanism 5 is constructed of a feed roller
6 rotationally driven by a motor, not shown, and a leaf
plate 7 pressing the printing paper P against the feed
roller 6.In more concrete terms, the feed roller 6 is divided
into three pieces in the direction transverse to the printing
paper P so that its surface of friction with the printing
paper P is limited to a minimum that is necessary and,
thereby, the load on the motor is reduced. Further, the
leaf plate 7 is structured so as to press the printing
paper P sent over to the feed roller 6 through automatic
or manual paper feeding against the feed roller 6 by its
spring force. The leaf plate 7 is shaped, at the place
where it faces the paper guide surface 8, to push the
transported printing paper P to the paper guide surface
8, in order to secure good flatness of the printing paper
P.Fig. 11 shows a paper guide unit 21 on which the
paper guide surface 8 is formed. In the paper guide unit
21, there are formed hollow portions 22 permitting the
feed roller 6 divided into three pieces to be positioned
therein. The hollow portion 22 extends into the region of
the paper guide surface 8.In the printer of the above described structure, the
printing paper P transported to the paper guide surface
8 pressed against the feed roller 6 by the leaf plate 7 is
printed with ink jetted from the nose portion 4 of the ink
jet head 3, which is reciprocated in the direction transverse
to the paper, and then, it is transported along the
paper guide surface 8 and discharged into a paper
stacker, not shown, on the downstream

<CLAIMS>
An ink jet printer comprising:

a guide path (33) for guiding printing paper (P)
in the direction from a paper feeding side to a paper

discharging side;
a feed roller (6) having its peripheral surface
in contact with said guide path and rotating by being

driven by a driving portion;
a leaf plate (7) abutting on said feed roller
through said guide path;
a flat paper guide surface (8) disposed in said
guide path downstream of the place where said feed

roller and said leaf plate are in contact and
constituting a portion of said guide path;
an ink jet head (3) having a nose portion (4) for
jetting ink, said nose portion being disposed opposite

to said paper guide surface across said guide path;
and
a plurality of projections (11, 12, 15) disposed
in the region between the place where said leaf plate 

contacts said feed roller and the place where said
nose portion of said ink jet head opposes said paper

guide surface and arranged at predetermined intervals
in the direction transverse to said printing paper for

interfering with said guide path, said projections
being formed on said paper guide surface.
The ink jet printer according to Claim 1, wherein
said feed roller is divided into a plurality of

pieces, said paper guide surface is extended into the
areas between said feed roller pieces, and said

projections are formed in the areas to which said
paper guide surface is extended.
The ink jet printer according to Claim 2, wherein

said projections disposed close to said feed roller
pieces are longer in the direction of transportation

of said printing paper than said projections disposed
in other positions.
The ink jet printer according to Claim 2, wherein
said projections are also formed in the positions

adjacently to said feed roller pieces. 
The ink jet printer according to Claim 1, wherein
said feed roller is divided into a plurality of

pieces, and said paper guide surface is extended into
the areas between said roller pieces, said ink jet

printer further comprising auxiliary projections
disposed in positions adjacent to the places where

said leaf plate contacts said feed roller pieces in
said extended areas and contacting both side ends of
