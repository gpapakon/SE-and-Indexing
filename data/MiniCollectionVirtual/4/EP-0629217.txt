<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to soluble rigid-rod polymers
having rigid-rod backbones and pendant, solubilizing
organic groups attached to the backbone, and to methods
for preparing the polymers. This invention also relates to
copolymers comprising rigid-rod segments, having
solubilizing organic groups attached to the rigid-rod
segments. The rigid-rod polymers can, for example, be
used as self-reinforced engineering plastics, can be used
in combination with flexible coiled polymer binders for
the preparation of high tensile strength molecular
composites and can be used as matrix resins for fiber-containing
composites.High-performance fiber-polymer composites are rapidly
achieving a prominent role in the design and construction
of military and commercial aircraft, sports and industrial 
equipment, and automotive components. Composites fill the
need for stiffness, strength, and low weight that cannot
be met by other materials. The most widely utilized high-performance
fiber-polymer composites are composed of
oriented carbon (graphite) fibers embedded in a suitable
polymer matrix. To contribute high strength and stiffness .
to the composite, the fibers must have a high aspect ratio
(length to width). Fibers may be chopped or continuous.
The mechanical properties of chopped fiber composites
improve greatly as the aspect ratio increases from 1 to
about 100. Mechanical properties still improve but at a
slower rate for further increases in aspect ratio.
Therefore, aspect ratios of at least about 25, and
preferably of at least about 100 are desirable for chopped
fiber composites. Composites prepared with continuous
fibers have the highest stiffness and strength.
Fabricating fiber-containing composites, however, requires
significant manual labor and such composites cannot be
recycled. Furthermore, defective and/or damaged composite
materials cannot be easily repaired.Molecular composites are high-performance materials
which are much more economical and easier to process than
conventional fiber-polymer composites. In addition,
molecular composites can be recycled and are repairable.
Molecular composites are composed of polymeric materials
only, i.e., they contain no fibers. Such molecular composites
can be fabricated much more simply than fiber-polymer
composites.Molecular composites are materials composed of a rigid-rod
polymer embedded in a flexible polymer matrix. The
rigid-rod polymer can be thought of as the microscopic
equivalent of the fiber in a fiber-polymer composite.
