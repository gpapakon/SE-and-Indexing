<ABSTRACT>
Different kinds of texture samples (41-45, 51-55, 
61-65) smaller than the knitted fabric (30) to be 

produced are knitted with different loop lengths and 
finished. The loop length and loop density for the 

fabric are determined from the sample having an optimum 
texture. The density obtained is applied to pattern 

data as to the fabric to determine wale and course 
numbers, and the fabric is knitted with the determined 

loop length and finished.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
producing knitted articles, and more particularly to a
method of producing a knitted article as designed in
respect of texture, wale and course numbers and size
without test production.Knitted articles have the problem that the texture
and size of the article can not be determined before the
article is actually knitted and finished. With respect
to texture, for example, knitted articles which are
identical in wale and course numbers vary in texture
owing to various conditions involved in the knitting
process. Articles as knitted are finished as by
soaping, milling and steaming, and shipped after the
resulting shrinkage has been made saturated to some
extent. The knitted article alters in texture and also
in size when subjected to the finishing process. Since
different treatments are performed for finishing, the
alteration of texture resulting from the finishing
process is unpredictable. This is also true with the
size; articles which are identical in wale and course
numbers differ in size owing to minute variations in
knitting conditions, peculiarity of the machine,
humidity, kind of the material, etc.,. while the
finishing process entails an altered size. For example,
even when treated by basically the same finishing
process, knitted articles exhibit different degrees of
shrinkage or deformation due to slightly different
conditions, e.g., differences in the temperature or 
duration of steaming and in season, or depending on the
amount of material or yarn used or on the compactness of
loops. Accordingly, it is impossible to predict to what
extent the-finishing process alters the texture or size.
For these reasons, articles of the desired texture or
size are not available if they are knitted with stitch
data only controlled. Even if the stitch data is so
determined as to compensate for the possible variation
in size or texture with empirical consideration given to
the influence of the knitting conditions and finishing
conditions, the size presently deviates from the target
value by about ± several percent, and the texture is
still undeterminable unless the article is actually
knitted and finished.Since the texture and size of knitted articles are
unpredictable, test production is practised in the art
of knitting. As literally apparent, the term test
production means preparing the contemplated knitted
article in actual size for trial. Several kinds of
samples are made by test production and finished to
evaluate the resulting texture and size and determine
the

A method of producing a knitted article while
controlling the loop length, comprising:


determining the shape and size of the knitted
article to be produced;
knitting different kinds of samples;
finishing the samples and thereafter evaluating the
samples; and
knitting the article on the basis of the evaluation
of the samples;

   characterized in that:

said step of knitting different kinds of samples
comprises:


knitting different kinds of texture samples (41 to
45) in a size smaller than said predetermined size with

different loop lengths,
said step of finishing the samples and thereafter
evaluating the samples comprises:


finishing the textured samples (41 to 45) and
thereafter evaluating the texture of the samples to

select an optimum sample,
determining the loop length of the knitted article
to be produced from the loop length of the optimum

sample and determining the wale number and course number

the finished optimum sample or from the wale and course
numbers thereof per unit length, and
said step of knitting the article on the basis of
the evaluation of the samples comprises:


knitting the article with the determined wale
number and course number while controlling the loop

length so that the loop length is in match with the
determined loop length.
A method of producing a knitted article as
defined in claim 1 which is characterized in that the

knitted article is a fashioned article or integral knit 
article, the method further being characterized by using

pattern data as to the knitted article to be produced as
the size of the knitted article and applying the size of

the finished optimum sample or the wale and course
numbers thereof per unit length to the pattern data to

determined the wale number and the course number of the
article.
A method of producing a knitted article as
defined in claim 1 or 2 which is characterized in that

the size of the finished optimum sample of the wale and
course numbers thereof per unit length are measured at a

central portion of the optimum sample.
A method of producing a knitted article as
defined in claim 1, 2 or 3, which is characterized by

producing the knitted article with use of at least one
yarn having different colors at different positions

along the length thereof, and identifying loops to be
formed by portions of the yarn respectively based on

data as to the loop length of the article to determine
the color of the yarn at different positions along its

length and to cause specified loops to assume the
determined color.
A method of producing a knitted article as
defined in claim 4 which is characterized by dyeing the

yarn in different colors at different positions along
its length based on the data as to the loop length.
