<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for receiving stabilisers for beverages such as beer, wine, fruit juice or other liquids. To stabilise these liquids, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone is used which adsorbs the potential haze-forming compounds, such as polyphenols. In order to form an apparatus which is simple to handle and can receive a large amount of granular stabiliser (7), it is provided to construct the apparatus as a cartridge (2) which has a liquid-permeable inlet wall (19) and a liquid-permeable outlet wall (20). The liquid-permeable walls (19, 20), together with an abutting housing wall (9, 10; 13, 14) delimiting the cartridge (2), delimit a receptacle (18, 21) which can be charged with the stabiliser (7).

A device for receiving granular stabilising agents for the stabilisation
of drinks and other liquids by adsorption of
 potential cloudiness
formers,
characterised in that
 the device is designed as a cartridge
(2) which features a liquid-permeable in-flow wall (19) and a liquid-permeable

out-flow wall (20) which, together with a contiguous
housing wall (9, 10; 13, 14) which delimits the cartridge, delimit a

receiving chamber (18, 21) which can be filled with the stabilising
agent (7).
A device in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that
 at least one of the liquid-permeable
walls (19, 20) consists of a woven fabric (6), the side of which facing

away from the receiving chamber (18, 21) is borne by a supporting
body which forms the housing wall (9, 10; 13, 14).
A device in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that
 at least one of the liquid-permeable
walls (19, 20) consists of a pressure-stable, porous material.
A device in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 the in-flow wall (19) and the out-flow
wall (20) are arranged in parallel at a from each other and are

connected to the cartridge walls (9, 10; 13, 14).
A device in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the cartridge (2) is designed to be
axially symmetrical to a central axis (8). 
A device in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that
 the receiving chamber (18, 21) of the
cartridge (2) is annular in shape with an inner cylindrical cavity (16)

which passes through the cartridge (2), whereby an axial front wall (23,
24) is designed as a removable lid (14) and it is possible to insert a rod

(22) which holds the cartridge (2) in the cavity (16).
A device in accordance with Claim 6,
characterised in that
 the axial front walls (23, 24) of the
annular chamber (18) are formed by the in-flow wall (19) and the out-flow

wall (20), whereby out-flowing liquid is discharged via the inner
cavity (16) through the out-flow wall (20).
A device in accordance with Claim 7,
characterised in that
 the inner and the outer peripheral wall
of the annular chamber (18) is formed by pressure-stable, liquid-proof

cylindrical housing walls (9, 10) of the cartridge (2).
A device in accordance with Claim 7,
characterised in that
 the inner and the outer peripheral
walls of the annular chamber (18) are formed by a liquid-proof film

(36, 37) which, together with the in-flow wall (19) and the out-flow
wall (20), form a receiving bag (39).
A device in accordance with one of Claims 6 to 9,
characterised in that
 the external diameter of the cartridge
(2) is approximately 50 mm to 600 mm, the diameter of the inner

cavity (16) is approximately 5 mm to 500 mm and the axial height is
approximately 40 mm to 1000 mm.
A device in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that
 the side of the out-flow wall (20)
facing away from the receiving chamber (18) delimits a discharge 

chamber (25) which extends along the surface of the out-flow wall (20)
and has an outlet (27) which discharges into the inner cavity (16).
A device in accordance with Claim 11,
characterised in that
 the chamber walls (26, 26') of the
discharge chamber (25) are designed in the form of an outer surface

with the housing wall (9, 10) of the cartridge (2).
A device in accordance with Claim 11,
characterised in that
 the discharge chamber (25) axially
separates neighbouring cartridges (2) which are arranged at least

approximately mirror symmetrically to a symmetrical plane (38) which
runs vertical to the central axis (8), and the discharge chamber (25) is

delimited by the opposing out-flow walls (20) of the cartridge (2).
A device in accordance with Claim 13,
characterised in that
 the discharge chamber (25) is
designed in the form of a plate-shaped, pressure-stable drainage body

(41) which carries a cartridge (2) on each of its axial front faces.
A device in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 14,
characterised in that
 the cartridge (2) is axially stackable,
whereby a spacer is positioned on one front wall (23, 24) of the

cartridge (2).
A device in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 15,
characterised in that
 the stabilising agent (9) has a granular
size of approx. 25 µm to 400 µm to which a fine grain content of up to

8% by mass is preferably added, whereby the granular size of the fine
grain content then lies between 1 µm and 25 µm.
