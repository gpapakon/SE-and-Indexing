<ABSTRACT>
Rear-view mirror including a fixed support (10), an axe-type cross-member shaft (14), an orientable mirror-holder plate (20) and a device for holding the axe-type cross-member shaft. The means for holding the first shaft (16) of the axe-type cross-member shaft include a first (26) and a second (28) rigid bearing, which are aligned integrally with the front face (12) of the fixed support (10) and serve for positive holding of the first shaft (16). At least the first bearing (26) has a front opening (34) which extends, from its front opening (34), to the front face (12) of the fixed support (10). The means for holding the second shaft (18) of the axe-type cross member shaft include a third (30) and a fourth (32) rigid bearing which are aligned integrally with the rear face of the plate (20) and serve for positive holding of the second shaft (18). At least the third bearing (30) is equipped in similar fashion to the first bearing.
