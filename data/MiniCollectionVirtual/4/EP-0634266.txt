<ABSTRACT>
Tire components are assembled on a tire building drum (10) 
by laying a first liner (24) on a surface of the drum, 

positioning first sidewall inserts (26) below the cylindrical 
surface of the drum and around the drum at insert 

locations spaced from each end of the drum, laying a first 
carcass ply (28) around the drum, positioning second inserts (30) 

over the first ply at the insert locations, laying a 
second carcass ply (44) over the first ply and the second inserts, 

positioning beads (46) at each end of the drum, expanding the 
drum to increase the diameter of the cylindrical surface 

of the drum and provide shoulders at each end of the drum, 
turning edges of the first ply and the second ply over 

each of the beads, positioning a belt (60) and tread (61) assembly 
around the second ply, and contracting the drum for 

removal of the assembled tire components from the drum. 
The inserts are positioned in grooves (20) extending radially 

inwardly in the outer surface of the building drum. The 
grooves enable thick inserts to be built into the tire 

sidewall while still maintaining a generally flat outer 
surface of the tire while on the bui
lding drum, thereby 
decreasing the possibility of air trapped between 

components of the uncured tire.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mechanical tire building
drums for building extended mobility pneumatic tires, and
more specifically to a tire building drum having contours
or depressions in its surface to facilitate building
certain tire designs.Tire performance can be affected by adding components
to the tire or by adjusting the location of tire
components in the tire during the tire building process.
During the tire building process, it is important that
components fit together well with a minimum of wrinkling
of the tire components or trapping of air between the
components. If air is trapped between the uncured tire
components, the tire may be defective and may have to be
scrapped. During the tire building process, if it appears
the air has been trapped between tire components, the tire
builder must stitch the interfaces between the uncured
elastomeric components to work any bubbles or trapped air
from between the components.This problem is further magnified in tire designs
where components are rather thick compared to other
components such as the tire construction shown in U.K.
Patent Application GB-A-2 087 805. For example, when a
component having a relatively square cross-section, such
as a tire bead, is positioned adjacent a more planar
component, such as a ply, the air may be trapped where the
different-shaped 
components are necessarily placed next to each
other, the problem of trapped air is even more difficult.In one particular extended mobility tire design,
inserts are positioned in the sidewall between the carcass
plies to enable the tire to support the weight of the
vehicle even if the tire should lose inflation pressure.
These inserts are typically thicker than the plies which
lie adjacent to them and it is important that this tire be
built without trapping air between the plies and inserts.
In accordance with the present invention, an inventive
tire building method and drum have been designed which
have features to accommodate the special production needs
of such tires. These special features will be described
hereinafter and contribute to the building of a quality
tire without trapping air.In accordance with the present
invention, there is provided a method of
assembling tire components on a tire building drum
and a tire building apparatus for assembling tire components as
defined in the claims. The features of claim 1 which are known from the prior
art are as follows.
