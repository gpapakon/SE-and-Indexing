<ABSTRACT>
A system includes an apparatus and a method for
separating objects such as cells, particles and the like from

at least a portion of the fluid in which they are suspended.
The apparatus includes a source (12) of fluid (13) with the objects

suspended therein, a collection member (14) for retaining at least
a portion of the fluid, a pump (52) for circulating the fluid along

a flow path through a filter assembly (16) and back to the
collection member, and a valve (58) for maintaining the level of

the fluid in the collection member (14) within a range around the
low level sensor (20). The method of separating such objects

includes providing the fluid with the objects suspended
therein, circulating the fluid (13) through the filtration

assembly (16), drawing off a portion of the fluid with the objects
removed therefrom and monitoring the level of the fluid in the

collection member (14). In this way, the apparatus and method of
the present system are suitable for use to separate objects

such as cells, particles and the like for concentration with
an acceptable degree of recoverability and viability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a system for 
separating one material from another, and more specifically 
relates to an apparatus and method for separating cells, 
particles or like objects from at least a portion of a fluid 
in which such objects are suspended, with the objects, for 
example, having been previously sorted or otherwise separated 
by a flow cytometer. In this way, the apparatus and method 
may be used, for example, to concentrate the objects. Flow cytometry, the measurement and/or separation of 
objects such as cells and other particles in a moving liquid 
stream, is well established as a valuable analysis tool in 
research and clinical laboratories. A discussion of the 
various principles, techniques and apparatus behind flow 
cytometry is set forth in an article by John L. Haynes, 
entitled "Principles of Flow Cytometry", Cytometry Supplement 
3:7-17 (1988), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated 
by reference. Conventional flow cytometry devices for sorting objects 
such as cells and particles with specific characteristics 
basically consist of a liquid stream forming a sheath to focus 
the objects as they pass through an orifice associated with 
the analyzing or counting capabilities of the device. 
Usually, the objects can be sorted at high speeds to collect  
 
tens of thousand of the objects based on a variety of chemical 
and physical characteristics such as size, granulation of the 
cytoplasm and presentation of specific antigens. Accordingly, 
there has been considerable interest in flow cytometry to sort 
objects for subsequent analysis. In one type of sorting cytometer, after detecting the 
desired characteristic with an optical electronic system, the 
stream containing the individual objects is electrically 
charged shortly before being broken into droplets containing 
individual objects. An electrostatic field then diverts the 
flow of object-containing droplets into two or more streams 
depending on the polarity and charge of the droplets, and the 
divided streams are collected in separate containers as 
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,230,558 
(Fulwyler), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated in 
its entirety by reference. In another type of sorting cytometer, the stream is 
likewise broken into droplets for collection with the portion 
of the stream containing the objects of interest collected 
after detection by the optical electronic system. In contrast 
to the first type, the sorting may be accomplished by 
deflection of the

An apparatus for separating objects such as cells, 
particles and the like from at least a portion of a fluid in 

which they are contained or otherwise suspended, comprising: 
   source means for supplying a fluid with said objects to be 

separated suspended therein; 
   collection means for retaining at least partially diluted 

objects; 
   filtration means for filtering at least a portion of said 

objects from said fluid; 
   circulating means for circulating said fluid from said 

collection means through said filtration means while at least a 
portion of said fluid may be drawn off to concentrate said 

objects in a remaining portion of said fluid, while permitting 
the objects suspended in the remaining portion of said fluid to 

continue to be circulated through the apparatus; and 
   fluid level control means for monitoring and controlling the 

level of fluid in said collection means. 
The apparatus defined in claim 1, wherein said fluid 
level control means is adapted to include said sensing means for 

detecting when said fluid approaches a high level point and for 
detecting when said fluid approaches a low level point and is 

adapted to include a lifting means for raising and lowering said 
collection means. 
The apparatus defined in claim 2, wherein said lifting 
means includes a lifter valve, a source of compressed air and a 

cylinder connected to said lifer, with said cylinder in 
 

communication with said source of compressed air and said fluid 
level control means is also adapted to lower said collection 

means to drain off any remaining fluid from said flow path upon 
completion of a concentration phase. 
The apparatus defined in claim 1, wherein said 
filtration means is adapted to include a filter membrane 

positioned along a flow path through which said portion of fluid 
is drawn off and said circulating means is adapted to include a 

circulating pump for circulating said fluid from said collection 
means through said filter assembly and back to said collection 

means. 
The apparatus defined in claim 4, wherein said 
filtration means is adapted to include filtrate removal means for 

drawing off said portion of said fluid through said filter 
membrane, with said filtrate removal means including at least one 

pump and a valve so that when said valve is in a first position 
said portion of fluid is drawn through said filter membrane. 
A method for separating objects such as cells, 
particles and the like from at least a portion of a fluid in 

which such objects are suspended, comprising the steps of: 
   providing said fluid with said objects suspended therein to 

a collection member; 
   circulating said fluid from said collection member along a 

flow path through a filtration assembly and returning at least a 
 

remaining portion of said fluid to said collection member with a 
higher concentration of objects suspended therein; 

   drawing off a portion of said fluid from said filtration 
assembly as said fluid circulates therethrough, while permitting 

the objects suspended in the remaining fluid to continue to be 
circulated along said flow path; and 

   monitoring and controlling the level of said fluid in said 
collection member. 
The method defined in claim 6, further comprising the 
step of passing said fluid through said filtration assembly 

tangentially to a first side of a filter membrane with sufficient 
force to prevent said objects from being lodged against said 

first side of said filter membrane while permitting said portion 
of said fluid to pass through said filter membrane and be drawn 

off from the remaining portion of fluid circulating along said 
flow path through said circulating means. 
The method defined in claim 7, further comprising the 
step of providing a negative pressure difference to a second side

member to drain off any remaining fluid from said flow path and
