<ABSTRACT>
A nano-crystalline soft magnetic alloy ribbon having a 
structure being occupied by nano-crystalline particles having an 

average particle size of 50 nm or less at least 50% of the alloy 
structure. A ceramic insulation coating is formed on its surface 

so that the coating becomes thicker at the both ends of the 
ribbon than at the center in the transverse direction of the 

ribbon and the thickness dx at the coating ends and the average 
thickness da of the coating determined by a mass measurement 

method are in the relations of 1.2da ≦ dx ≦ 5da and dx ≦ 10 µm. 
With a magnetic core using such a nano-crystalline soft magnetic 

alloy ribbon, magnetic components including saturable reactor, 
transformer, saturable transformer, acceleration cavity and surge 

absorbing elements such as surge block core in neutral beam 
injector can realize a higher performance. The invention also 

results in a higher reliability for the devices using such 
magnetic components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to soft magnetic alloy 
ribbons and magnetic cores comprising such ribbons, and further 
relates to pulse generators, laser units and accelerators using 
such magnetic cores. The magnetic cores are used in magnetic 
components which operate at magnetization speed ΔB/τ of about 
0.1 to 100 T/µs where ΔB is defined as the magnetic flux 
density swing and τ, the period during which ΔB changes from 10 
to 90%. The examples of such magnetic components are saturable 
reactors, saturable transformers, or transformers used in high 
voltage pulse generators for laser units including excimer laser, 
TEA(Transversely Excited Atmospheric)-CO2 laser, TEMA 
(Transversely Excited Multi-Atmospheric)-CO2 laser or copper 
vapor laser and are surge absorbing elements such as a surge 
block cores in neutral beam injectors. Laser units including excimer laser, TEA-CO2 laser, TEMA-CO2 
laser or copper vapor laser as well as accelerators such as a 
linear induction accelerator generally incorporate a high 
repetition rate high voltage pulse generators, in which the 
energy stored in a capacitor is discharged with a discharge tube 
such as a thyratron or a semiconductor switching device such as a 
thyristor. For improving the output power, repetition frequency, 
efficiency and reliability of such high voltage pulse  
 
generators, it is important to reduce losses at above switching 
devices. For this purpose, magnetic components such as a step-up 
transformer, a saturable transformer and a saturable reactor are 
used. The above linear induction accelerator incorporates an 
acceleration cavity utilizing a magnetic core for generation or 
acceleration of charged particle beam such as electron beam. The ion sources in a neutral beam injector comprise magnetic 
components to suppress surge voltage. For the magnetic components used for these applications, it 
is important to reduce magnetic core volume and core loss. It is 
well known that the magnetic core volume and the core loss are in 
inverse proportion to the square of the effective magnetic flux 
density swing ΔB, when the temperature rise at the magnetic 
core caused by the core loss is ignored. If the reset 
magnetizing force is large enough, the magnetic flux density 
swing ΔB is about twice of the effective magnetic flux density 
Bms. Thus, it is preferable to use a magnetic core made of Fe-based 
soft magnetic alloy with high saturation magnetic flux 
density. In the aforementioned applications of magnetic components, 
the magnetization
