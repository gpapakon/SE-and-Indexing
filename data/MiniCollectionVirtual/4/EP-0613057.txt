<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of toner compositions comprising 

(i) preparing a pigment dispersion in a solvent, which dispersion comprises a 
pigment, an ionic surfactant and optionally a charge control agent; 
(ii) shearing the pigment dispersion with a latex mixture comprised of a counterionic 
surfactant with a charge polarity of opposite sign to that of the ionic surfactant, a nonionic 

surfactant and resin particles, thereby causing a flocculation or heterocoagulation of the 
formed particles of pigment, resin and charge control agent to form electrostatically bound 

toner size aggregates; and 
(iii) heating the statically bound aggregated particles to form the toner composition 
comprising polymeric resin, pigment and optionally a charge control agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to toner processes, and more specifically,
to aggregation and coalescence processes for the preparation of toner compositions.In reprographic technologies, such as xerographic and ionographic devices, toners
with average volume diameter particle sizes of from about 9 microns to about 20 microns are
effectively utilized. Moreover, in some xerographic technologies, such as the high volume
Xerox Corporation 5090 copier-duplicator, high resolution characteristics and low image noise
are highly desired, and can be attained utilizing the small sized toners of the present invention
with an average volume particle of less than 11 microns and preferably less than about 7
microns, and with narrow geometric size distribution (GSD) of from about 1.2 to about 1.3.
Additionally, in some xerographic systems wherein process color is utilized such as pictorial
color applications, small particle size colored toners of from about 3 to about 9 microns are
highly desired to avoid paper curling. Paper curling is especially observed in pictorial or process
color applications wherein three to four layers of toners are transferred and fused onto paper.
During the fusing step, moisture is driven off from the paper due to the high fusing
temperatures of from about 130 to 160°C applied to the paper from the fuser. Where only one
layer of toner is present such as in black or in highlight xerographic applications, the amount of
moisture driven off during fusing is reabsorbed proportionally by paper and the resulting print
remains relatively flat with minimal curl. In pictorial color process applications wherein three
to four colored toner layers are present, a thicker toner plastic level present after the fusing
step inhibits the paper from sufficiently absorbing the moisture lost during the fusing step, and
image paper curling results. These and other disadvantages and problems are avoided or
minimized with the toners and processes of the present invention. It is preferable to use small
toner particle sizes such as from about 1 to 7 microns and with higher pigment loading, such as
from about 5 to about 12 percent by weight of toner, such that the mass of toner layers
deposited onto paper is reduced to obtain the same quality of image and resulting in a thinner
plastic toner layer onto paper after fusing, thereby minimizing or avoiding paper curling.
Toners prepared in accordance with the present invention enable the use of lower fusing
temperatures, such as from about 120 to about 150°C,
