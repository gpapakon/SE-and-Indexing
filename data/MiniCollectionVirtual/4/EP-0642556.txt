<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a polymer blend, a process for the preparation thereof and products manufactured from the polymer blend. The polymer blend contains 95 to 50 parts by weight of a polyolefin- or polyester-based polymer matrix, 5 to 50 parts by weight of an aromatic main-chain liquid crystalline polymer, and plastic additives, if any. Further, the blend contains, based on the total weight of the previous components, 0.1 to 30 per cent by weight of a substance (a compatibilizer) which improves the compatibility of the polymer matrix and the liquid crystalline component. According to the invention, the compatibilizer comprises a polymer containing reactive, functional groups. Preferably the compatibilizer comprises a SEBS polymer functionalized with maleic anhydride or an olefin polymer functionalized with glycidyl methacrylate. Having excellent tensile, flexural and impact strength, the polymer blends according to the invention, can be used for the manufacture of tubes, pipes, sheets and fibres. They are suited, e.g., for manufacture of constructional parts of electrical and optical cables.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a liquid crystalline blend
according to the preamble of claim 1.This kind of a blend comprises a polymer matrix and a liquid
crystalline polymer. The blend further contains a substance
which enhances the compatibility of the polymer matrix and
the liquid crystalline polymer.The invention also relates to a process according to the
preamble of claim 13 for preparing liquid crystalline polymer
blends and to products according to claims 18 and 19, which
essentially consist of said polymer blends.Liquid crystalline polymers are polymers which in melt state
lie between the boundaries of solid substances and liquids.
The liquid crystalline structure is called a mesomorphic
phase or an anisotropic phase because macroscopically in the
melt state the liquid crystalline polymers are fluids. Microscopically
they have a regular structure similar to that of
crystals. The liquid crystalline polymers are called "thermotropic"
if their anisotropy depends on the temperature only.
The strength and stiffness of many thermoplastics can be
substantially improved by blending them with thermotropic,
main-chain liquid crystalline polymers. This is because the
liquid crystalline polymers form fibres which orientate in
the flow direction of the thermoplastic matrix melt. As a
result there is an improvement of the mechanical properties,
such as tensile strength and modulus of elasticity, of the
thermoplastic in this direction. Often, the addition of the
liquid crystalline polymer also improves the heat resistance
and dimensional stability of the thermoplastics and makes it
easier to process them. The above-mentioned polymer blends are, however, hampered by
the problem that their transversal properties, such as impact
strength, are inferior to those of the corresponding
unblended plastics. This phenomenon is due to the anisotropic
structure and to the poor adhesion between the liquid
crystalline polymer phase and the thermoplastic phase.It is known in the art that the compatibility of liquid
crystalline polymers and thermoplastics and that the impact
strength of blends thereof can, to some extent, be improved
by adding to the blends a third component, i.e. a substance
known as a compatibilizer. The task of the compatibilizer is,
for instance, to diminish surface tension between the phases,
to improve adhesion, and to improve dispersion.EP Published Patent Application No. 0 369 734 describes a
polymer blend which consists of a poly(alkylene
terephthalate) matrix, a polyacrylate-based liquid
crystalline
