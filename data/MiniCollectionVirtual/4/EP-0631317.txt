<ABSTRACT>
An integrated semiconductor device is formed by bonding
the conductors (CI1, CI2) of one fabricated semiconductor device

(SD) having a substrate (SIS) to the conductors (COI1,COI2) on
another fabricated semiconductor device (MOD) having a substrate

(SUB), flowing an etch-resist (PH) in the form of a photoresist
between the devices, allowing the etch-resist to dry, and removing

the substrate (SUB) from one of the semiconductor devices.

Preferably the etch-resist is retained to impart mechanical strength

to the device. More specifically, a hybrid semiconductor device is
formed by bonding the conductors of one or more GaAs/AlGaAs multiple

quantum well modulators to conductors on an IC chip, flowing a
photoresist between the modulators and the chip, allowing the

photoresist to dry, and removing the substrate from the modulator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bonding of fully-fabricated 
semiconductor devices onto other fully-fabricated 
semiconductor devices so as to produce 
integrated units, and particularly to bonding fully-fabricated 
photonic elements, such as GaAs/AlGaAs multiple 
quantum well (MQW) modulators, onto fully-fabricated 
integrated circuit (IC) chips such as Si or even GaAs. Integration of photonic devices with silicon IC 
chips makes it possible to combine the advantages of each. 
Among photonic devices, GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well 
(MQW) modulators are particularly beneficial as 
input/output (I/O) elements on IC chips because they have 
a high absorption coefficient of light and can serve as 
both receivers and transmitters. They typically operate at 
an optical wavelength (λ) of 850 nm (nanometers). Growing GaAs/AlGaAs on fully-fabricated IC chips 
has proven difficult because it subjects the IC chips to 
damage. On the other hand, techniques exist for bonding 
fully-fabricated semiconductor devices to each other. 
However, these leave the substrates of each device in 
place. This subjects the bonds to adverse mechanical 
stresses that may affect the devices adversely. In the 
case of GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well (MQW) modulators, 
the substrates are GaAs which are opaque to the operating 
wavelength of the GaAS/AlGaAs modulators, and hence require 
removal for operation. Nevertheless, it is very difficult 
to place and bond GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well (MQW) 
modulators, if they have had their substrates removed, onto 
silicon IC chips. Prior techniques for bonding 
fully- fabricated semiconductor devices to each other, and  
 
in particular multiple quantum well (MQW) modulators to 
silicon IC chips, suffer the disadvantages of mechanical 
stress, opacity, or cumbersome handling. An object of the invention is to overcome these 
disadvantages. Another object of the invention is to improve 
bonding of semiconductor devices with each other. Another object of the invention is to improve 
bonding of photonic elements with electronic elements. According to a feature of the invention we 
achieve such objects by bonding the conductors of one 
fabricated semiconductor device having a substrate to the 
conductors on another fabricated semiconductor device 
having a substrate, flowing an etch-resist between the 
devices, allowing the etch-resist to dry, and removing the 
substrate from one of the semiconductor devices. According to another feature of the invention, 
one semiconductor device is a device
