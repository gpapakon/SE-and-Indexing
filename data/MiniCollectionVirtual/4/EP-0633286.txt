<ABSTRACT>
Curable epoxy resin compositions containing   (a) an epoxy resin containing, on average, more than one epoxide group per molecule (b) an epoxy-resin curing agent in an amount sufficient to cure the epoxy resin, (c) wollastonite having a mean particle size of less than 100  mu m in an amount of from 10 to 350 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of components (a) and (b), (d) a quartz/kaolinite mixture having a mean particle size of less than 100  mu m in an amount of from 10 to 350 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of components (a) and (b), where the proportion of components (c) and (d) together is not greater than 360 parts by weight, and optionally   (e) conventional additives, are suitable for the production of moulded materials having high-gloss surfaces.
