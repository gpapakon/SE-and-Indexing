<ABSTRACT>
An electric car air-conditioning apparatus, 
which is small in size and capable of preventing abnormal 

heating upon occurrence of a failure and preventing 
damage when a capacitor (11) is connected with its 

polarity reversed, provided with a current-conduction 
detecting device (9) for detecting the operation of 

current conduction of a current conducting device (8) for 
charging the capacitor (11) with a current from a battery 

(2), and a power breaking device (4) for breaking a 
current from the battery (2), wherein a control section 

(6) actuates the power breaking device (4) to break the 
current from the battery (2) in the case where the 

current-conduction detecting device (9) detects the 
operation of current conduction for a period longer than 

a predetermined time when the control section (6) is not 
outputting a control signal for closing a switching 

device (3) through which power is supplied from the 
battery (2) to drive a motor-driven air compressor (5), 

and in the case where the current-conduction detecting 
device (9) detects the operation of current conduction 

when the control section (6) is outputting the control 
signal for closing the switching device (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric
car air-conditioning apparatus having a motor-driven air
compressor driven by the power supplied from a battery.The operation of a conventional electric car
air-conditioning apparatus will be described with reference
to a circuit diagram of a conventional electric car
air-conditioning apparatus shown in Fig. 2.When a battery 2 is connected, a capacitor 11
is charged with a time constant determined by a product
of the resistance value of a resistor 8 and the electrostatic
capacity value of the capacitor 11. If an input
voltage detecting means 7 of a motor-driven air
compressor driving unit 1 detects a voltage larger than a
predetermined value, a switching device 3 is closed by a
control section 6 so that power is supplied from the
battery 2 through the switching device 3, so that the
air-conditioning motor-driven air compressor 5 is driven
by the motor-driven air compressor driving unit 1.The resistance value of the resistor 8 must be
large enough to restrain a charging rush current in order
to prevent a fuse 10 from breaking. On the other hand,
the resistance value must be small enough so that the 
fuse 10 is broken upon occurrence of a failure such as
damage of the motor-driven air compressor driving unit 1
or short-circuiting of the capacitor 11 or the like.
Since the fuse 10 must not be broken in a normal
operation current, the value of the fuse 10 is set to
about 10A. Accordingly, in order to flow a current about
40A to break the fuse 10 surely upon occurrence of a
failure, the resistance value of the resistor 8 is set to
7.5 ohm when the voltage of the battery 2 is 300V.In the above-mentioned circuit, in the case
where the fuse 10 does not break at the time of a half-failure
of the motor-driven air compressor driving unit 1
or the capacitor 11 or the like, that is, for example, in
the case where a current of 9A flows, the resistor 8
consumes a large power of (9A)2 x 7.5ohm = 607.5W.
Accordingly, overheating causes deterioration of
reliability such as smoking, solder dissolving, wiring
damage, and so on. It is therefore necessary to provide
a radiator or the like as a countermeasure to overheating.
Accordingly the air-conditioning apparatus becomes
large in size.When the input voltage to the motor-driven air
compressor driving unit 1 does not rise in the case where
the capacitor 11 is connected with its polarity reversed,
the input voltage detecting means 7 does not detect the
fact that the input voltage has exceeded a predetermined
value, so that the
