<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid pressure generating 
device according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a fluid pressure generating device according to the class 
of the present invention is revealed in US-A-4 850 812. This 
fluid pressure generating device comprises a casing, a motor 
contained in the casing provided with a rotor having a fitting 
hole at its center, a cylinder block having a main shaft at its 
center and a plurality of cylinders on its outer peripheral 
portion, wherein pistons are slidably fitted in said cylinders, 
each piston having a head portion on one side of the cylinders, 
and the cylinder block further having ports with a sectional 
area smaller than the sectional area of the cylinders on the 
other side of the cylinders opposite to the pistons, a piston 
actuator arranged opposite the head portions and having an 
inclined surface on which the head portions or shoes retained 
by the head portions will slide, a valve plate arranged 
opposite to one end of the cylinder block opposite the piston 
side and having a suction port and a discharge port 
communicating with a suction passage and a discharge passage, 
respectively, wherein the cylinder block is fixedly fitted to 
the fitting hole of the rotor, and the main shaft is supported 
to a stationary member including the casing, so that the rotor 
is supported to the stationary member via the cylinder block 
and the main shaft.  
 In general, a fluid pressure generating device 
comprising a motor and a liquid pump driven by the motor is 
provided in the following construction. That is, the 
liquid pump (hereinafter, referred to as a pump) and the 
motor that drives the pump (hereinafter, referred to as a 
motor) are formed independently of each other. Then the 
output shaft of the motor is coupled with the input shaft 
of the pump via a coupling so that driving force of the 
motor is transmitted to the pump (Japanese Utility Model 
Laid-Open Publication No. 61-116192). However, when the pump and the motor are formed 
independently of each other as shown above, there has been 
a problem that noise would occur at the shaft coupling 
portion because of misalignment between the output shaft 
and the input shaft, in addition to operating noises of the 
pump and the motor themselves, resulting in a great noise  
 
as a whole. Also, since the pump and the motor are 
directly coupled with each other in the axial direction, 
the resulting axial length would become rather long so that 
the fluid pressure generating device as a
