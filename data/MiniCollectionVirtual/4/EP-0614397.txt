<ABSTRACT>
A sewage water installation has a discharge basin in which is arranged a screening unit linked to a back-and-forth movable cleaning carriage. The discharge basin (20) is subdivided by a partition (24) and by the screening unit (30) into a banking-up chamber (25') and an outflow chamber (25''). The banking-up chamber (25') is linked to an inflow pipe (26) and to an outflow pipe (27) and the outflow chamber (25'') is linked to an outflow pipe (28). In order to increase the banked-up volume and to reduce the throughflow speed, a banking-up element (40) is arranged on the back-side of the screening unit (30), seen in the direction of flow, inclined so as to form an angle ((alpha)') therewith.

Waste water plant, consisting of a spillway basin 
(20; 120), which is connected to at least one inflow 

channel (26; 126) and at least one drain channel (28; 
128), and of a screening rake unit (30; 130), which is 

disposed in the basin and comprises a screening rake 
consisting of parallel rake bars and a reciprocating 

cleaning carriage to which a cleaning comb is secured, 
the teeth of which comb are disposed between the rake 

bars of the screening rake, characterised in that the 
spillway basin (20; 120) is divided by a partition (24; 

124) into an inflow space (25'; 125') and a drain space 
(25'', 125''), and the screening rake unit (30; 130) is 

disposed at the partition (24; 124), and that a baffle 
element (40; 140) is provided to increase the impounded 

volume, which element is disposed after the screening 
rake unit (30; 130) in the flow direction and at an 

angle of inclination (α; α') relative to the vertical 

plane. 
Waste water plant according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the baffle element is secured to 

the partition (24; 124) so as to project into the drain 
space (25''; 125''). 
Waste water plant according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the baffle element is secured to 

the inclined top edge of the partition (24; 124) or is 
formed by this.  

 
Waste water plant according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the baffle element (40; 140) is 

disposed at an angle (α; α') of the order of 30° to 45° 
with respect to the vertical plane. 
Waste water plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the baffle element (40; 

140) can be adjusted and fixed in terms of its 
inclination relative to the screening rake unit (30; 

130) in accordance with the quantity of water arising. 
Waste water plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the partition (24) is at 

a height (N1) which is greater than the height (N) of 
an overflow opening (22') via which the spillway basin 

(20) is connected to an associated retention basin 
(10). 
Waste water plant according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that a spillway basin (160) is 

disposed in the inflow space (125'), which basin is 
associated with the screening rake unit (130), is 

provided with a pre-chamber (161) and comprises an 
overflow edge (164) lying above the screening rake unit 

(130). 
Waste water plant according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the overflow edge (164) of the 

spillway basin (160) is at a height (N3) which is 
greater than the height (N) of an overflow opening 

(122') via which the spillway basin (120) is connected 
to an associated retention basin (110).  

 
Waste water plant according to claim 7 or 8, 
characterised in that the baffle element (140) can be 

adjusted and fixed in terms of its inclination relative 
to the screening rake unit (130) under the control of 

sensors in accordance with the water level in the pre-chamber 
(161). 
Waste water plant according to claim 7, 8 or 9, 
characterised in that the pre-chamber (161) of the 

spillway basin (160) is provided with a screening 
material shaft (162) which is connected thereto via an 

opening (162') and with which a slide element (165) is 
associated for discharging the screening material. 
Waste water plant according to claim 10, 
characterised in that the slide element (165) can be 

actuated via a traction member (171) which is 
operatively connected to a drive (170). 
Waste water plant according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the screening rake unit 

is tilted with its top edge in the direction of the 
inflow space. 
Waste water plant according to claim 12, 
characterised in that the angle of tilt of the 

screening rake unit (30; 130) with respect to the 
vertical plane is 15° to 60°, preferably 30° to 40°.
