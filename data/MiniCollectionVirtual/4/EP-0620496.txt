<ABSTRACT>
In known photographic apparatus, processing 
is achieved by passing the material to be processed 

from one processing stage to the next in a 
predetermined sequence. This necessitates that the 

processing stages are sequentially arranged in the 
apparatus. However, if the material being processed 

requires more than one identical processing step, for 
example, two or more wash processes, the processing 

stages need to be duplicated. Described herein is 
apparatus in which the processing stages need not be 

duplicated and in which the stages may be arranged 
accordingly. The apparatus comprises a rotating drum 

(110) on which the material (16) to be processed is 
mounted, and a multi-tank container (112) housing a 

plurality of compartments (120, 122, 124, 126, 128), 
each compartment containing one of the desired 

processing solutions (130, 132, 134, 136, 138). 
Application rollers (140, 142, 144, 146, 148) are 

associated with respective ones of the compartments 
(120, 122, 124, 126, 128) for transferring the 

processing solutions contained therein on to the 
material (16) being processed. Each application 

roller (140, 142, 144, 146, 148) moves from a first 
position where no contact is made with the rotating 

drum to a second position where contact is made with 
the rotating drum (110) to effect the transfer of 

processing solution. Additionally, an exposing device 
(116) may be provided for forming an image on the 

material (16) to be processed prior to processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
photographic apparatus and is more particularly,
although not exclusively, concerned with photographic
processing apparatus having low throughputs.In most known photographic processing
apparatus, photographic material is passed through a
series of baths containing processing solutions
appropriate to that particular material. The material
is driven sequentially through the baths by roller
pairs.In other processing apparatus, a plurality
of rollers is used to pick up processing solutions
from trays and transfer the solutions on to the
material as it is passed across the top of the
rollers.In both cases, the material is free and it
is effectively passed from solution to solution. For
example, in a simple photographic process, developer,
fixer and wash solutions have to be arranged in order
so that the material can pass from one processing
stage to the next in one pass.EP-A-0 226 213, for example, discloses a wet
type color electrophotographic copying machine, in
which three developing devices are mounted on a
movable carriage. Each device has a lifting means
associated therewith, which raises it towards a
rotating drum. When in the raised position, an
associated feed pump is arranged to spray the
developer on to photosensitive material on the drum.
To complete the operation, (a) the carriage has to be
moved linearly to bring the respective developing 
device into position below the drum, (b) the device
has to be lifted up towards the drum, (c) the pump has
to be operated to transfer the developer, (d) the
device has to be lowered, and (e) these four steps
have to be repeated for the other two developing
devices. US 5 064 738 discloses process and apparatus
for liquid development of a latent electrostatic
image, in which a paper sheet on a platen is
continuously moved over successive processing stages,
which involve a skiving roller. At the processing
stations where material is to be transferred to the
paper, this is done by fountain-type applicators.However, it is difficult to reduce the size
and complexity of the processing apparatus when
several identical processing stages are required.In accordance with the present invention,
there is provided photographic apparatus including at
least a processing stage which comprises:-
a rotatably-driven drum on which material
(16) to be processed is mounted;a plurality of reservoirs each containing a
processing solution; andapplicator means for transferring processing
solution from the plurality of reservoirs to the
material being

<CLAIMS>
Photographic apparatus (1) including at
least a processing stage which comprises:-


a rotatably-driven drum (10) on which
material (16) to be processed is mounted;
a plurality of reservoirs (12, 20, 22, 24,
26, 28) each containing a processing solution (30, 32,

34, 36, 38); and
applicator means (40, 42, 44, 46, 48) for
transferring processing solution (30, 32, 34, 36, 38)

from the plurality of reservoirs (12, 20, 22, 24, 26,
28) to the material (16) being processed;

   characterized in that the applicator means
comprises a plurality of linearly spaced-apart

application rollers (40, 42, 44, 46, 48), each
application roller (40, 42, 44, 46, 48) being

associated with a respective one of the reservoirs
(12, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28); and

   in that transfer of processing solution (30,
32, 34, 36, 38) from the application rollers (40, 42,

44, 46, 48) to material (16) mounted on the rotating
drum (10) is effected by a linear movement of the

rollers (40, 42, 44, 46, 48) so as to bring respective
ones thereof into contacting driven relationship with

the drum (10).
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
the plurality of reservoirs (20, 22, 24, 26, 28) is

plane which extends parallel to the direction of
reciprocating motion. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein
each application roller (20, 22, 24, 26, 28) moves
