<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a
plastisol which has high fluidity and excellent storability, and provides films or molded articles of excellent
mechanical strength and toughness.A plastisol is composed of a liquid plasticizer having fine polymer particles dispersed therein, usually together with
other additives such as fillers including pigments, and is in wide use as a molding material. When the plastisol is heat-treated
at a suitable temperature, the polymer particles get mixed with the plasticizer, and when being cooled to normal
temperatures, it solidifies to form a gelled material such as films or molded articles.The plastisol is exemplified by one composed of a plasticizer having polyvinyl chloride dispersed therein, and such
a plastisol is preferably used to form a protective coating on outer plates of automobiles. The polyvinyl chloride plastisol
has many advantages. For example, it has an advantage that polyvinyl chloride particles are stably dispersed in a
plasticizer for a long period of time without being plasticized by the plasticizer and with substantially no increase in
vicosity when it is stored at normal temperatures, and yet when the plastisol is heat-treated at a suitable temperature,
it gets well mixed with the plasticizer.However, the polyvinyl chloride resin has disadvantages. It generates a toxic hydrogen chloride gas when it is
burnt, and it is difficult to reuse the resin for the purpose of resource saving. Hence a new plastisol which will take the
place of polyvinyl chloride plastisol is demanded from the standpoint of environmental protection.In view of such background, a number of polymers formed of vinyl monomers which contain no halogens have
been investigated for a component of plastisol in lieu of polyvinyl chloride. However, the polymers which have been
heretofore proposed have many problems depending upon the degree of miscibility with a plasticizer combined therewith
for the production of plastisols.Firstly, for instance, some of the polymers get mixed with a plasticizer soon at normal temperatures when they are
dispersed in a plasticizer, and hence the resultant plastisol is poor in storability. Secondly, some of the polymers form
a plastisol together with a plasticizer, but the viscosity of the plastisol increases with time at normal temperatures, and
hence such a plastisol is poor in fluidity. Thirdly, some of the polymers form a plastisol together with a plasticizer which
is stable at normal temperatures, but when it is heated and then cooled back to normal
