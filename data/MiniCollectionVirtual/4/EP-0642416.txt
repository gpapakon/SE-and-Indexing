<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
methods of making fiber/resin
composites. In a specific aspect, the present invention
relates to resin articles comprising arrays of continuous
filaments, such as are formed by filament winding and
prepregs.In the field of composite materials, a variety of
fabrication methods and techniques have come into usage
for producing fiber-reinforced resin matrix materials.
Continuous filament processes have evolved which are
adapted to automated production of filament-reinforced
resin articles. The continuous fiber processes include
filament winding, wherein the filament in the form of
discrete strands or roving is coated with a rasin, then
wound on a mandrel at a predetermined angle and winding
thickness to yield composite articles having high
strength when the resin borne on the filament is cured.In order to have commercial utility the polymeric
resins employed in filament winding operations must
exhibit low initial viscosity and long pot-life in the
process systems in which they are employed. Low
viscosity is required in order that deposition of the
resin an the filament be highly uniform in character, as
is required to achieve substantially uniform properties
in the final product article. If viscosity changes
appreciably during the filament winding operation, the
applied resin thickness may change significantly,
resulting in localized stresses or discontinuities in the
final product article, product articles which are not
within required dimensional tolerance specifications, and
inadequate curing of the resin. In addition, the 
tensional forces on the resin impregnated filaments being
processed will significantly increase as the resin
viscosity increases, to such extent that the filament
becomes highly susceptible to snapping, i.e., tensionally
breaking.Long pot-life of the resin is particularly necessary
in filament winding operations where processing times may
be on the order of hours. Since the resin is
continuously being applied to the filament in these
processes, the resin bath or other source of the resin
must be continually replenished with resin coating
material, and it is therefore necessary that the resin
not "set up" or gel in the source bath or other source
container and applicating means.For example, in the fabrication of rocket motors, a
resin-bearing filament is wound onto a solid rocket fuel
body. In such applications, since the filament winding
operation may take upwards of 6 hours and since viscosity
must be substantially stable during this
