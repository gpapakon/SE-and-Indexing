<ABSTRACT>
A cooling ceiling for room air conditioning exhibits a pipe system (2) which has cooling water flowing through it, which is provided, at least in certain areas, between the ceiling (3) of the building and ceiling elements (4) arranged at a distance beneath said ceiling, and which is fixed in the installation position via a retaining member (6, 6') which bears the ceiling elements (4). In this arrangement, the cooling pipes (7) of the pipe system (2), on the one hand, rest in a region located opposite the ceiling elements (4) and, on the other hand, have acoustic mats (8) fitted over them in the direction of a ceiling cavity (25). In its upper side directed towards the ceiling, the retaining member (6, 6') is connected to a supporting device (12) which defines a laying plane (11) for the acoustic mats (8), the acoustic mats (8) being supported on said supporting device in the installation position, and an intermediate ceiling space (15) being formed between the underside (14) of said acoustic mats and the cooling pipes (7) located in the installation position.

A cooling ceiling for air conditioning a room with a system of pipes (2) through
which cooling water flows, the system being provided at least in regions between the

ceiling (3) of a building and ceiling elements (4) spaced below the ceiling and being
fixed in the mounting position by means of a holding element (6, 6') supporting the

ceiling elements (4), the cooling pipes (7) of the pipe system (2) in a portion opposite
said ceiling element (4) on the one hand abutting the same when in the mounting

position and, on the side directed toward a ceiling cavity (25), being embraced by
sound-insulating acoustic mats (8), on the other hand, the holding element (6, 6') being

connected with a supporting device (12) defining a plane (11) for placing the acoustic
mats (8) on which the acoustic mats (8) are supported in the mounting position, and

wherein an intermediate ceiling space (15) is formed between the lower surfaces (14)
of the acoustic mats (8) and the cooling pipes (7) in the mounted position, characterized

in that the upper surface of said holding element (6, 6'), facing the ceiling, is connected
with the supporting device (12).
The cooling ceiling of claim 1, characterized in that said intermediate ceiling space
(15) is formed as a convection space substantially closed to the upper side and accessible

from below for rising warm air (17).
The cooling ceiling of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said intermediate ceiling
space (15) is accessible via gaps (18) left between the ceiling elements (4).
The cooling ceiling of one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that passage openings
are provided at least in portions of said ceiling elements (4).
The cooling ceiling of one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that said supporting
device (12) comprises profiled T beams (20) arranged in parallel and with a mutual 

distance, the longer legs (21) being adapted to be fixed to the ceiling (3) by means of
a holding member (5) and the shorter supporting legs (23) supporting the edges of said

acoustic mats (8), on the one hand, and being connected with said holding element (6,
6'), on the other hand.
