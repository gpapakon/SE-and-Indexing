is after electric-mechanic switch; 
   when solid switch is used as linear control or PWM 

switch control, electric-mechanic switch which is serialized 
to it will not operate; said solid switch and 

electric-mechanic switch can be controlled by CCU, or 
manually, or electric-magnetically, or mechanically, or
