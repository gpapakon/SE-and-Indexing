<ABSTRACT>
An open cooling device (refrigerating device) (1) for the storage of pastries (3), in particular the storage of chocolate-coated dry pastries, in which there is arranged in the region of a receiving container for the pastries a cooling plant (refrigerating plant) (7), the heat exchanger of which is impinged by an air flow generated by means of fans, the air supply taking place in the lower region of the container and the air discharge taking place in the upper region thereof, while the side walls of the container are hermetically sealed, is to be designed in such a way that the disadvantageous influencing of the pastries is avoided and that it is ensured that even chocolate-coated dry pastries can be stored for relatively long periods of time (several days). For this purpose, it is provided according to the invention that the cooling air be generated by means of an air conditioning unit (7) which is arranged in a space located at a relatively large distance from the container (1) of the cooling device and which is connected via an air supply conduit (6) to the container (1) for the pastries, the supply air generated by the air conditioning unit being subjected to drying by the air conditioning unit.

Open cooling arrangement for storing baked goods,
in particular for storing chocolate-coated dry baked

goods, having a receiving container (1) which is intended
for the baked goods, has cooling air admitted to it and

whose side walls (11) are hermetically sealed, characterized
in that the cooling air is generated by means of an

air-conditioning unit (7) which is arranged in a room
located at a relatively large distance from the container

(1) of the cooling arrangement and which is connected to
the container (1) for the baked goods via an air-supply

line (6), the air supplied from the air-conditioning unit
(7) being subjected to drying by the air-conditioning

unit (7).
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the dried cooling air coming from the

air-conditioning unit (7) has an initial temperature of
approximately 15 to 18Â°C.
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the cooling air is directed through

at least one air-supply pipe (5), which makes it possible
for the different pressures which prevail at the beginning

and at the end of the air-supply pipe to be taken
into account and equalized.
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the air-supply pipe (5), or the air-supply

pipes, extends/extend approximately over the
entire length (L) of the container (1), uniformly distributed

openings (4) being provided over the length of

the air-supply pipe or pipes for the purpose of uniform 
air-pressure distribution.
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the diameters of the openings (4)

increase from the beginning of the air-supply pipe (5) or
pipes to the end of the air-supply pipes.
Cooling arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the air-supply

pipe or the air-supply pipes (5) is/are located at least
above the baked goods stored in the container (1).
Cooling arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the air-conditioning

unit (7) is hermetically sealed with respect
to the air inside the container (1).
Cooling arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the air-conditioning

unit (7) is provided with devices for
sterilization purposes, for example by ionization or by

UV radiation.
Cooling arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that, in a central

region of the container (1), the air-supply pipe (5) is
routed transversely through said container.
Cooling arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that, instead of the

holes (4) in the air-supply pipe (5), rotatable nozzles
(26, 27) are inserted into the openings.
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 10,
characterized in that the nozzles (26, 27) can be rotated

or pivoted such that the air jets out of the air-supply
pipe (5) are oriented downwards or obliquely downwards.
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 11,
characterized in that a carrier (12), on which the baked

goods which are to be cooled are positioned, is arranged
directly beneath the air jets out of the openings (4) of

the air-supply pipe (5), or out of the nozzles (26, 27)
inserted therein.
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 12,
characterized in that the carrier (12) is inclined

towards the viewer, it being the case that the angle of 
the cooling air flowing onto the carrier (12), and the

angle of inclination of the carrier (12), are selected
such that the cooling air flows downwards along the

carrier (12).
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 9 or 10,
characterized in that the rotatable and pivotable air-supply

nozzles (27) are provided with an annular gap (28)
in order to ensure that the air distribution and air

supply in the container (1) are as uniform as possible.
