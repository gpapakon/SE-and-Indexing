<ABSTRACT>
Immunoassay methods utilizing HCV envelope antigens that contain conformational epitopes reactive with antibodies in serum from infected individuals are useful for screening and diagnosis. These antigens detect antibodies that are not detected by denaturated HCV envelope antigens. In addition, these HCV envelope antigens comprised of conformational epitopes are more immunologically reactive than a number of other HCV antigens. This is the first evidence that conformational epitopes may be involved in the immunologic response to HCV antigens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to materials and methodologies for managing the spread of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. More specifically, it relates to polypeptides useful immunological reagents in the detection, prevention and treatment of HCV infections, as well as immunoassays and kits employing.HCV was first identified and characterized as the primary cause of post transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) by Houghton et al. In addition to providing substantial information concerning HCV, Houghton et al. and their collaborators have disclosed a number of general and specific immunological reagents and methods. See, e.g. Houghton et al., EPO Pub. No. 318,216; Houghton et al., EPO Pub. No. 388,232; Chao et al., Science (1989) 244: 359-362; Kuo et al., Science (1989) 244:362-364; Takeuchi et al., J. Gen.

<CLAIMS>
An in vitro method for detecting antibodies which arise relatively early during the course of infection in a body component of a mammalian host to hepatitis C virus (HCV), comprising the steps of:

(a) contacting said body component suspected of containing antibodies to HCV with (1) an HCV antigen selected from an antigen encoded in the E1 domain of an HCV genome, the E2 domain of an HCV genome or aggregates thereof, wherein said HCV antigen is purified under non-denaturing conditions or (2) a standard control, under conditions that allow an immunological reaction to occur; and
(b) detecting the presence of immune complexes of said antibodies and said antigen, wherein the absence of said immune complexes containing the standard control and the presence of said immune complexes containing said HCV antigen indicate seroconversion to HCV.
The method of claim 1 wherein said HCV antigen is encoded within the E1 domain of an HCV genome.
The method of claims 1 or 2 wherein said HCV antigen is E1.
The method of claim 1 wherein said HCV antigen is encoded within the E2 domain of an HCV genome.
The method of claims 1 or 4 wherein said HCV antigen is E2.
The method of claim 1 wherein said HCV antigen is an E1/E2 aggregate.
The method of claim 1 wherein said HCV antigen is an E1/E1 aggregate.
The method of claim 1 wherein said HCV antigen is an E2/E2 aggregate.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 8 wherein said HCV antigen or aggregate is expressed from recombinant vaccinia virus.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 8 wherein said HCV antigen or aggregate is expressed in CHO cells.
