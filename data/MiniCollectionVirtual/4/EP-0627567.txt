<ABSTRACT>
A sleeve (24) for an anchor bolt is formed from a blank (2) 
comprising a cylindrical collar (4) having a number of segments (8) 

extending radially outwards and bending the segments (8) 
inwardly to form a sleeve (24) in which the segments lie 

generally cylindrically about the axis of the collar (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to anchor bolts and in 
particular to a method of manufacturing such and or bolts 
and parts therefor. Anchor bolts are used for providing fixings in concrete 
and similar materials. An anchor bolt usually comprises a 
sleeve assembly, generally of overall tubular form, which is 
located on a setting member in the form of a bolt comprising 
an expander head which may be integral or in the form of a 
nut. The anchor bolt is located in a hole in a concrete and 
the like, with the sleeve and the expander head in the hole, 
and the bolt is then drawn into the sleeve, often by 
tightening a nut which bears onto the surface of the 
concrete, and the expander head thus causes the sleeve to 
expand outwards against the surface of the hole, thus to 
secure the anchor bolt in the hole. Anchor bolts are designed to provide anchorages of 
different strengths. A light duty anchor bolt may comprise 
a sleeve of comparatively thin sheet metal, which can be 
formed into a tube (possibly with an axial slit), around the 
bolt. In a heavy duty anchor bolt however the sleeve is 
more substantial, and typically is made up of a number of 
cast segments, which are held in position on the bolt by a 
pressed cap and by a retaining ring located in a 
circumferential groove formed in the outer surface of the 
segments. Thus the production of a typical heavy duty anchor bolt 
requires the separate forming of the cast segments, which 
may be three or more in number, and an end cap and the 
assembly of the segments, the end cap and the receiving ring 
on a bolt. An attempt to simplify the manufacture of such an 
anchor bolt is described in European Patent Application No. 
0 154 466 in the name of the Rawlplug Company Limited. This  
 
application describes an anchor bolt having a sleeve which 
is cast as a single component. A nut may also be 
incorporated in the casting and coupled to the sleeve by 
frangible portions which will fracture when force is applied 
to the nut to draw it into the sleeve. The sleeve is formed 
by sand or investment casting or some other process which 
utilises sacrificial or expanding cores. Unfortunately, the 
requirement for such sacrificial or expanding cores 
increases the complexity and expense of the forming process. It is among the objects of the present invention to 
provide an improved method of forming a sleeve for a heavy 
duty anchor bolt. According to the present invention there is provided a 
method of forming a sleeve for use in an anchor bolt 
comprising

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a sleeve for use in an anchor 
bolt comprising 

   forming a blank comprising a cylindrical collar having 
   a plurality of segments extending radially outward 

from an end portion of the collar and bending the segments 
inwardly to an assembly position in which they lie generally 

cylindrically around the axis of the collar to provide a 
sleeve. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the blank is 
formed by casting. 
A method according to claim 2 wherein the blank is cast 
from malleable iron. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the blank is 
formed by pressing or forging. 
A method according to claim 4 wherein the blank is 
formed from mild steel. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein each segment is joined to the end portion of the 

collar through a portion of the collar of reduced cross 
section. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein the thickness of each segment along a centre line 

thereof is approximately equal to the radial thickness of 
the collar. 
A method according to claim 7 wherein the outer 
surface of each segment when in its assembly position is 

rounded, approximately circular about the axis. 
A method according to claim 8 wherein the end portion 
of each segment is tapered on its inner surface. 
A method according to any one of the preceding wherein 
the blank comprises six segments. 
A method of assembling an anchor bolt comprising the 
steps of assembling a sleeve formed according to any one of 

the preceding claims, and positioning the sleeve on a 
setting member having a faceted head adapted to engage end 

portions of the segments. 
An anchor bolt made by a method according to claim 11.
