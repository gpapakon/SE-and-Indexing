<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is the use of an emulsion containing one or more polyunsaturated, long-chained omega-3 fatty acids or their pharmaceutically acceptable esters or salts and the usual adjuvants or additives to produce a medicament to be parenterally administered for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, especially inflammatory lung diseases, inflammatory intestinal diseases and lupus erythematodes, especially mucoviscidosis and/or colitis ulcerosa. In the emulsions used in the invention, the omega-3 fatty acids, their pharmaceutically acceptable esters or salts are contained in pure form or as a component of oils like natural, prepared, semi-synthetic or synthetic oils, preferably fish oils. The preferred forms of such emulsions are those containing oils, preferably fish oils, glycerin, at least one emulsifier and water for injection purposes, in which the oils contain at least 20 wt % omega-3 fatty acids.

<CLAIMS>
Use of an emulsion containing a plurality of multiply 
unsaturated, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids or their 

pharmaceutically well-tolerated esters or salts, as well 
as the usual auxiliary substances and additives, for the 

manufacture of a parenterally administered medicinal 
substance for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. 
Use according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
omega-3 fatty acids have 18 to 22 carbon atoms. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
omega-3 fatty acid is eicosapentaenoic acid and/or 

docosahexaenoic acid, but preferably eicosapentaenoic 
acid. 
Use according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the esters are present as ethyl 

ester or glycerol ester, but preferably as triglycerides. 
Use according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the omega-3 fatty acids or their esters 

or salts are present in the emulsions in quantities of 3 
to 30%/w. 
Use according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
omega-3 fatty acids or their esters or salts are present 

in the emulsions in quantities of 3 to 30%/w. 
Use according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the omega-3 fatty acids are present in 

the form of oils, preferably fish oils.  
 
Use according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
emulsion consists of 3 to 30%/w fish oils which contain 

20 to 100%/w omega-3 fatty acids with reference to the 
total fatty acids, 1 to 5%/w glycerol, 0.1 to 6%/w of at 

least one emulsifier, and water for injection purposes. 
Use according to claim 8, characterised in that the fish 
oils contain from 40 to 100%/w omega-3 fatty acids with 

reference to the total fatty acids. 
Use according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in that the 
fish oils constitute about 10 to 20%/w of the emulsion. 
Use according to one or more of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that phospholipids of vegetable or 

animal origin are used as the emulsifier. 
Use according to claim 11, characterised in that egg 
lecithin, egg phosphatides, soya phosphatides, soya 

lecithin and other phosphatides are used as the 
emulsifier. 
Use according to claim 12, characterised in that egg 

lecithin is used as the emulsifier. 
Use according to one or more of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that the emulsifier is used in a 

quantity of 0.4 to 2%/w with reference to the emulsion. 
Use according to one or more of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that the daily dose is 1 to 30 g omega-3 

fatty acids.
