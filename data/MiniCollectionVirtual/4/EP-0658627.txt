<ABSTRACT>
Insertion of IFN-alpha promoters in recombinant DNAs 
improves their expression efficiencies for useful polypeptides. 

Expression of such a recombinant DNA in host cells of mammalian 
origin is artificially controllable by the presence and absence 

of external stimuli using IFN-alpha inducers. Thus transformants 
with such a recombiant DNA readily increase to a 

maximized cell density with causing neither damages nor extinction 
due to polypeptides they produce, and subsequent exposure 

to IFN-alpha inducers allows the proliferated cells to efficiently 
produce polypeptides with significant glycosylations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel recombinant DNA and
a transformant containing the same, in particular, to a recombinant
DNA which enables artificial control on expression for
useful polypeptides, as well as to a transformed
host cell of mammalian origin wherein such recombinant DNA has
been introduced.Recent advances in recombinant DNA technology are
very striking. Nowadays even polypeptides which are present in
trace in living bodies can be easily produced in desired
amounts by application of recombinant DNA technology. The
typical models are insulin and IFN and in recent various types
of recombinant polypeptides are in practical uses or clinical
tests.Recombinant polypeptides are usually produced by
introducing DNAs which code such a polypeptide in host microorganisms
such as Escherichiacoli to make transformants,
cultivating them and purifying the resultant cultures. This
method has the merit that one can easily obtain transformants
with high efficiencies when he or she carefully constructs
recombinant DNAs, as well as the demerit that glycosylated 
polypeptides are however unobtainable therewith because microorganisms
lack abilities of glycosylating polypeptides.
Researches in the last several years revealed that in certain
lymphokines and cytokines glycosylation may have an important
influence on their efficacies and possible side effects.
While, unlike microorganisms, host cells of mammalian origin
physiologically effect glycosylation: Thus recently cells from
mammals including human have been revaluated as substituent
host for microorganisms.By the way, to allow DNAs to efficiently express in
hosts, it is necessary to link strong promoters thereto. A
variety of promoters have been devised hitherto, which can be
briefly divided into two types: One type is such which constitutively
expresses characteristics, while the other type
inducibly expresses on external stimuli. Generally in transformants,
dependently on hosts, produced polypeptides may
damage hosts to consequently reduce expression efficiencies of
DNAs or under certain circumstances to result in no expression
of even in death of hosts. Because of these, the use of the
latter type of promoters, i.e. those whose expression is
controllable by external stimuli, is preferable.Examples of conventional promoters which are known to
inducibly express on external stimuli are mouse mammary gland
tumor virus promoter, metallothionein promoter and heat-shock
proteins. These promoters have the merit that they enable
artificial control on expression of
