<ABSTRACT>
Device for stoppering a container (1) which has a neck (4) in which a mouth (10) is formed and which is provided with externally projecting ribs (5), each extending between a first end (5a) away from the mouth (10) and a second end (5b) near to the mouth, the device including an unscrewable stopper which has a side wall surrounding the neck (4) and which substantially matches the shape of the external ribs (5) of the said neck, the said stopper being made from an elastically deformable material, characterised in that at least some of the ribs (5) of the neck are separated in pairs by a circumferential distance (d), measured around the neck, which decreases progressively between the first and second end of the ribs.

A closure system for a receptacle (1) having a neck 
(4) in which an opening (10) is formed and provided with 

outwardly projecting external threads (5; 6, 7) each 
extending between a first end (5a; 6a, 7a) further from 

the opening (10) and a second end (5b; 6b, 7b) closer to 
the opening (10), the system comprising an unscrewable 

stopper (2; 3) having a side wall (2a; 3a) that surrounds 
the neck (4) and that fits substantially snugly over the 

shape of the external threads (5; 6, 7) of said neck, 
said stopper being made of a material that is elastically 

deformable, the system being characterized in that at 
least some of the threads (5; 6, 7) of the neck are 

spaced apart in pairs by a circumferential distance (d) 
around the neck that decreases progressively between the 

first and second ends of the threads. 
A system according to claim 1, in which the external 
threads (5) are wedge-shaped, their second ends (5b)
 
being wider than their first ends. 
A system according to claim 1, in which the external 
threads (6, 7) are distributed in two groups of threads 

comprising a first group of threads (6) forming a first 
angle (α
1
) relative to a direction of an axis of 
revolution of the neck, and a second group of threads (7) 

forming a second angle (α
2
) relative to said direction, 
said second angle (α
2
) being different from the first 
angle (α
1
) and the external threads of the two groups 
being distributed in alternation around the neck. 
A system according to any preceding claim, in which 
the neck (4) of the receptacle is made of a hard 

material, the stopper (3) is made of metal, and the side 
wall (3a) of the stopper is crimped onto the neck (4) in 

a region (12) that does not extend axially substantially  
 

beyond the first ends (5a; 6a, 7a) of the threads going 
away from the opening (10) of the neck. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 3, in 
which the neck (4) of the receptacle is made of a hard 

material, the stopper (2) is made of a flexible plastics 
material, and the side wall (2a) of the stopper includes 

inwardly directed projections (11) that overlie the 
external threads (5; 6, 7) of the neck and that do not 

extend axially substantially beyond the first ends (5a; 
6a, 7a) of the threads going away from the opening (10) 

of the neck, and the stopper (2) is engaged by force onto 
the neck by crushing said internal projections (11) of 

the stopper, said internal projections partially 
returning to their initial shape after screwing by force, 

constituting a substantially snug fit around the shape of 
the threads. 
A system according to claim 5, in which the stopper 
(2) is forced onto the neck (4) by being engaged axially 

and then screwed. 
A system according to claim 5, in which the stopper 
(2) is forced onto the neck (4) by being screwed. 
A system according to any one of claims 5 to 7, in 
which said internal projections are axial ribs (11). 
A system according to any preceding claim, in which 
the threads (5; 6, 7) have a barbed or "artillery" 

profile.
