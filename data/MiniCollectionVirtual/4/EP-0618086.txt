<ABSTRACT>
A carrier rail (32) for a ring binder (10) is formed with a 
deformation around each point where the ring member is to be attached to 

the rail (32), the deformation being in the form of a circular rib (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ring binders to hold paper and 
the like for loose-leaf binders, files, folders and the like. During the manufacture of prior art ring binders, a 
problem has been ascertained, namely that when the ring member is 
attached to the carrier rail of a ring binder, deformation of the rail 
around the base of the ring member is formed, causing slight bending 
of the whole rail itself. GB 2 209 500 A discloses a ring binder mechanism for 
loose-leaf binder with ring elements secured to carrier rails within a 
cover rail. A first end of the ring element is secured to the bottom 
of the carrier rail by flattening their ends against the bottom of the 
carrier rail. Alternatively, the first end of the ring element may be 
welded to the bottom of the carrier rail. It is an object of this invention to overcome the 
aforesaid problem, and/or to provide a useful alternative. In accordance with the invention, there is provided a 
carrier rail for a ring binder having at least one point where a ring 
member is to be attached to the rail, wherein the rail is pre-formed 
with a deformation around the or each such point. Suitably the deformation is in the form of a circular 
rib, and the end of each ring member is power pressed onto the rail 
within this circular rib so that no unnecessary deformation of the rail 
outside the circular rib is achieved.  
 The advantage of the invention is that in the prior art, 
deformation of the rail has led to 50% wastage during assembly, due 
to the fact that as the rails are slightly bent, such causes the ring 
binder to be difficult to assemble. A further problem with a bent rail is that during 
assembly of the ring binder, it is difficult to crimp the sides of a 
housing member around the edges of a bent rail. Suitably the rail is provided with at least one insertion 
hole into which the ring member is secured, wherein the insertion 
hole is surrounded by the deformation. Preferably a longitudinal rib is provided, which 
extends between two insertion holes. The provision of a rib in the rail provides stiffness 
thereto, which is required since holes in the rail weaken the integrity 
thereof. The invention will now be described by way of 
example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a ring binder in 
accordance with the invention; Figure 2 shows a carrier rail used in the ring binder of 
Figure 1; and Figure 3 shows a cross-sectional view of a ring 
member connected to the carrier rail shown in Figure 
2.
