<ABSTRACT>
A filter 2A(2C) which prevents the leakage of
electromagnetic waves from a PDP 1, and is provided with a

filter base 11 in front of the PDP 1 and grounded conductive
mesh 12 which transmits light on the base 11 on the PDP 1 side.

Alight scattering layer 13 is bonded to the mesh 12 with a
conductive adhesive 14 which transmits light, and the spaces of

the lattice (when the base 1 exists) of the mesh 12 are filled
with the adhesive 14 so that, when electric charge is induced

in the mesh 12 by a pulse voltage applied to the PDP 1 for
write/erase, the voltage across the lattice of the mesh 12 is

made nearly equal to the potential of the mesh 12 so as not to
cause electric discharge and generate noise. Alternatively, a

transparent antistatic layer 22 is provided between the PDP 1
and the mesh 12 so as not to generate noise by lowering the

pulse voltage applied to the PDP 1 for write/erase to such a
low value that no electric discharge occurs when electric

charges are induced in the mesh 12 by the pulse voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electromagnetic wave
leakage preventing filter with a filter base provided on the
frontal face on an image displaying portion, wherein a light
transmitting conductive mesh is mounted on the surface of the
image displaying portion side of the filter base, and the
conductive mesh is grounded to keep the electromagnetic wave
from the image displaying portion from leaking out.The image displaying portion used in an image display
includes a gas discharging display panel, for example, the
plasma display panel (hereunder referred to simply as "PDP").
The PDP excites the molecules of the gases sealed up inside by
discharging between the electrodes (more materially, it mixes
up the xenon gas and neon gas, and brings assistance to the
excitation of the xenon gas molecules), excites further the
fluorescent substance coated inside by the ultraviolet
radiation generated, emitting thus the visible light to display
an image. The discharging and the like under these
conditions however generate an electromagnetic wave allowing it
to leak out, though small in quantity.To prevent this electromagnetic wave from leaking out, an 
optical filter provided on the frontal face of the PDP to
intercept the wavelength in the near infrared region is endowed
with an electromagnetic wave leakage preventing feature.

This function to prevent the electromagnetic wave from leaking
out is achieved by providing, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, the
filter base 11 consisting of such synthetic resin plate as
acrylic, the base material of the optical filter (referred to
simply as "filter"), with a web-like formed conductor (referred
to simply as "conductive mesh 12"). As shown in Figure 3,
the conductor width and intervals of the grids of the
conductive mesh 12 have been set to their optimal values so
that the conductive mesh as grounded may cover the frequency
range of the electromagnetic wave to be prevented from leaking
and may not interfere with the image light. That is, the
electric charge excited at the conductive mesh 12 by the
electromagnetic wave is grounded by connecting this conductive
mesh 12 to the enclosure of the PDP with the orientation of the
mesh set obliquely, as shown in Figures 2 and 3, so that the
matrices of the PDP pixels should not overlap the mesh
conductor to intercept the image light.Note here that the PDP applies about 350 V of pulse
voltage between the electrodes at predetermined period required
for write/erase (the data of all the pixels is erased all at
once to write a new image
