<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an adjustable force transmission 
arrangement in a large diesel engine for accomplishing force 

transmission from a crankshaft (9) of the engine by means of 
gear wheels to at least one camshaft (11). The arrangement 

includes a first gear wheel (1), which is drivably connected 
to the crankshaft (9) and a second gear wheel (2), which is 

drivably connected the camshaft (11), said gear wheels (1, 2) 
being arranged adjacent to each other and in force 

transmitting connection with each other through a friction 
surface (5). In accordance with the invention the 

arrangement includes a guiding element (3) which is supported 
by means of a bearing element (7) to the engine block (6) so 

that it is guided both in the radial and in the axial 
direction. The guiding element (3) is arranged to be fixed 

by means of one or more screw bolts (4) or the like to said 
first gear wheel (1) so that said second gear wheel (2) is 

positioned between the first gear wheel (1) and the guiding 
element (3) and receives from these pieces its guidance also 

in the radial direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an adjustable force transmission 
arrangement in a large diesel engine for accomplishing force 
transmission from a crankshaft of the engine by means of gear 
wheels to at least one camshaft of the engine in accordance 
with the preamble of claim 1. A large diesel engine as referred to herein means an 
engine usable for example as the main propulsion engine or as 
an auxiliary engine for a ship or for power generation in the 
form of heat and/or electricity in a power plant. Force transmission arrangements for an engine camshaft 
are known, in which adjoining gear wheels are directly fixed 
to each other by means of screw bolts for example. In this 
case the setting of the rotational angle of the camshaft 
relative to the crankshaft can be changed by adjusting the 
relative positions of the gear wheels. For this purpose the 
holes provided for the screw bolts have to be oval so that the 
position of the screw bolts in the tangential direction of the 
gear wheels can be adjusted. This solution, however, allows 
for only a relatively small adjustment to be made and in 
addition it is a laborious procedure to make an adjustment. EP-A-280774 discloses an adjustable force transmission 
arrangement including a guiding element fixed to the engine 
block and to which gear wheels needed for the force 
transmission are turnably supported. The adjustment is 
carried out so that the gear wheel fixed to the camshaft is 
temporarily released by utilizing a hydraulic fluid to thereby 
allow turning of the camshaft relative to the gear wheel and, 
thus, to the crankshaft. Therefore the arrangement is 
complicated and the adjustment operation time consuming.  
 A force transmission arrangement relying on friction 
between the gear wheels, known as such, would make it possible 
to accommodate large angular adjustments but for it to be a 
practical solution it would be necessary to ensure that the 
measures needed for accomplishing an adjustment are as simple 
as possible. Thus, one aim of the invention is to provide a 
force transmission arrangement relying on friction between two 
gear wheels which is constructionally uncomplicated and 
reliable. Also the mutual attachment and detachment of the 
gear wheels as well as the adjustment of the relative 
positions thereof should be accomplished as simply as 
possible.  
 The aims of the invention are accomplished in a way more 
clearly defined in claim 1 and in the other claims. The 
arrangement according to the invention is characterised in that the
