<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is to provide thermoplastic polyurethane 
and a thermoplastic resin molded product containing said polyurethane, 

which is excellent in water vapor permeability and durable 
antistatic properties, without deteriorating the mechanical properties. 
The thermoplastic polyurethane of this invention is characterized 
by using, as the isocyanate component, 4,4'-methylenebisphenylisocyanate, 

as the chain extender, 1,4-butanediol, and, as the 
polyol component, poly (tetramethylene ether) glycol having a molecular 

weight of 1000 to 4500 and a random polyoxypropylene 
polyoxyethylene polyol having a molecular weight of 1000 to 3000, 

and by allowing the reaction to proceed by using, among them, 
materials in which the molar ratio of the active hydrogen components 

being polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene copolymer/{poly(tetramethylene 
ether) glycol + 1,4-butanediol} = 1/2 to 1/4.2.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic polyurethane and a thermoplastic 
resin molded product containing same. Thermoplastic 
resin molded products including film, sheet, covering materials 
are widely utilized. Among these molded products, from the view-points 
of their uses, many of them require water vapor permeability, 
and, some of them often require chemical destaticizing properties. 
The present invention relates to such a thermoplastic 
polyurethane and a thermoplastic resin molded product obtained 
therefrom which is excellent per se in water vapor permeability, 
and relates to such a thermoplastic resin molded product, having 
durable antistatic properties which do not lower the properties 
even after washing with water, by incorporating said polyurethane 
into another thermoplastic resin. As a means of imparting a thermoplastic resin molded product with 
water vapor permeability or antistatic properties, addition of an 
alkane sulfonic acid metal salt, carbon powder or metal powder 
to the said thermoplastic resin are conventionally conducted. 
However, in these conventional means, there are counted 
such drawbacks, namely, when the resultant molded product is 
washed with water, its water vapor permeability or antistatic 
properties are remarkably reduced, thus inviting poor durability 
of these products, and, besides, desirable coloration of the resultant 
molded products are impossible. Circumstances being such as above, as a means of imparting water 
vapor permeability or antistatic properties to a thermoplastic 
resin molded product, use of a composition prepared by adding 
thermoplastic polyurethane to a thermoplastic resin has been proposed 
(JPA H3 (1991)-259947, JPA H3 (1991)-259957). These proposals 
have, on one hand, such an advantage as coloring desirably on 
the resultant molded product, but, on the other hand, such drawbacks 
are inevitable as sufficient water vapor permeability or 
antistatic properties being hardly imparted, and, even when imparted, 
its durability is poor, and the properties of the molded 
products themselves being deteriorated. The problems that the present invention is to solve lie in that, 
in the proposals so far made using thermoplastic polyurethane, 
sufficient water vapor permeability or antistatic properties cannot 
be imparted to the resultant molded product or, even when imparted,  
 
its durability is poor, and the properties of the molded 
products themselves are deteriorated. Under such circumstances, the present inventors conducted diligent 
st
