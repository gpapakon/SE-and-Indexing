<ABSTRACT>
In a shock absorber, a hysteresis function, which 
occurs due to the compressibility of the working medium, 

is used as active parameter. The parameter is used for 
determining a damping force variation of the shock 

absorber during the respective piston stroke. Means (26, 
27, 28 and, respectively 40, 41, 42) influ
ence the volume 
of the working medium and/or the effect from the compressibility 

so that different spring lengths occur in the 
working medium. Adjustment or control (i) of the hysteresis 

function has the effect of redistributing the damping 
force during the said respective stroke.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement
for actively using in a shock absorber a hysteresis
function, which occurs due to the compressibility in the
working medium of the shock absorber, as parameter or
factor for determining the variation of the damping force
of the shock absorber during compression and/or expansion
movement(s) in the working medium, carried out by the
piston of the shock absorber relative to the cylinder of
the shock absorber. The said hysteresis function provides
different damping forces, considering the same relative
speed between piston and cylinder, depending on whether
the speed is increasing or decreasing.A hysteresis function due to the compressibility
of the working medium has already been known in connection
with shock absorbers. The existence of the hysteresis
function per se has been noted in known equipment,
where it made up a component which placed a load on
design of structures and functions in the environment of
the shock absorber.In connection with the said structures, the
hysteresis function has been experienced as a troublesome
and, in certain connections, critical factor. In a
special shock absorber which works with short strokes, it
is found that a large part of the stroke can be attributed
to a suspension movement attributable to the
compressibility of the working medium even though the
working medium is considered to be of the low-compressibility
type and normally consists of or comprises, for
example, hydraulic oil. This suspension movement is 
uncontrolled and results in different negative effects in
the shock absorber function at the different relative
speeds between piston and cylinder. The control and
adjustment function of the shock absorber in its entirety
becomes inaccurate and, even if the adjustable or controllable
parts of the shock absorber are adjusted or
controlled with great accuracy, the total adjustment or
control result becomes deficient. The arrangement according
to the present invention has the object of solving
this problem, among others.There is also a requirement to be able to realise
a greater freedom of action with respect to the design of
shock absorbers. The said unwanted suspension and
hysteresis function have been limiting factors in this.
The invention also solves this problem.There is also a requirement to be able to produce
shock absorbers with short strokes and with great accuracy
in the adjustment and control functions, for
example in cars of the INDYCAR type. The invention also
solves this problem. There is also a

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for actively using in a shock
absorber a hysteresis function, occurring due to the

compressibility in preferably low-compressive working
media of the shock absorber, as a parameter or factor for

determining the damping force variation of the shock
absorber during respective compression and/or expansion

movement(s) in the working medium carried out by the
piston (2) of the shock absorber relative to the cylinder

(1) of the shock absorber, whereby the hysteresis function,
considering the same relative speed between piston

and cylinder, provides different damping forces depending
on whether the speed is increasing or decreasing, characterised

in that means are arranged to influence the
effect from the compressibility of the medium and/or the

volume (working volume) of the medium, and thereby the
said hysteresis function, and in that one or more adjustments/change-overs

or controls of the hysteresis function,
carried out on or by the said means, cause directed

or controlled changes of the damping forces with
increasing and decreasing speed at the said respective

speed considered, thereby producing a change in the
damping force variations which results in a damping-force-changing,

for example damping-force-moving effect
during the respective compression and/or expansion

movement.
Arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterised in that it exhibits a two-position

adjustment of the magnitude and shape of the hysteresis,
produced by means of two valves (19, 20 and, respectively

25), preferably control valves, whereby in a first
influencing position for determining a first magnitude

and shape of the hysteresis, the function of the first
valve (19, 20) is connected and the function of the

second valve (25) is disconnected and, in a second
influencing position, the function of the second valve is

connected and the function of the first valve is
disconnected, where by the shock absorber operates in the

first-mentioned case with a large piston area, low 
pressure and small (compressed) working volume which

gives a small suspension/hysteresis function (70), and in
the last-mentioned case the shock absorber operates with

a small piston area, higher pressure and larger working
volume which gives a greater suspension/hysteresis

function (71), and/or that directed or controlled
variations in the volume of the working medium and

pressurisation bring about different desired
springs/spring lengths of the piston/piston rod and are

utilised for producing different hysteresis magnitudes
and hysteresis shapes.
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that the volume and/or effect of
compressibility of the medium is/are selectable so that

a desired slope from and directly after the zero area is
present in the damping force curve obtained.
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the said means comprise one or more

elements (26, 27, 28) increasing or decreasing the volume
of the medium with the aim of changing the spring

length/spring lengths of the medium, and that adjustment
or control (i) causes connection or disconnection of one

or more spaces (26, 27, 28 and, respectively 41, 42, 43)
to or, respectively, from the normal working space (1a

and/or 1b) of the piston in the cylinder (1), of which
connectable and disconnectable spaces first spaces (26,

27, 28) can be used for fine adjustment and second spaces
(41, 42, 43) can be used for coarse adjustment of the

hysteresis.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that adjustment or

control causes a change in the elasticity in one or more
media spaces (1a, 1b, 26, 27, 28 and, respectively, 41,

42, 43).
Arrangement according to any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that simultaneous

connection of two valves, preferably the said control
valves (19, 20 and, respectively, 25) results in a third

magnitude and shape of the hysteresis which gives a high 
force build-up in the zero area of the shock absorber

movement and retains a high damping capability at
decreasing speed.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the volume change is

arranged to occur following or directly outside the zero
force area of the shock absorber.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that shifting the working

medium between the top and undersides (1a and,
respectively, 1b) of the piston is arranged to take place

essentially outside the cylinder via a duct-part and
adjustment and/or control arrangement.
Arrangement according to any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the duct part and

adjustment and/or control arrangement consists of two at
least essentially functionally symmetrical parts which

are allocated to the compression and, respectively,
expansion movement of the shock absorber, and via which

arrangement an accumulator is connected to the working
space of the cylinder in such a manner that on the

respective compression movement, the accumulator receives
displaced media and on the respective expansion stroke

feeds back the received displaced media.
Arrangement according to any of Claims
1 - 8, characterised in that the duct part and adjustment

and/or control arrangement comprises four, for example
parallel ducts, of which two first ducts are allocated to

the compression movement and two second ducts are
allocated to the expansion movement, in addition to which

one duct in a respective pair includes control valves and
one duct in a respective pair includes bleed valves and

one-way-flow arrangements, and that an accumulator
arrangement is connected to one or more of the duct

parts.
