<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antimetastasis agent of
malignant tumors.Metastasis of malignant tumors is positioned as the
terminal phase in the process of progress of tumors,
which is a malignant phenotype that leads the patients to
death. At present, chemotherapy agents are mainly used
for inhibiting metastasis accompanied by enucleation of
tumors. However, satisfactory results are not always
obtained. Thus, development of an antimetastasis agent
having high effectiveness is desired.Recently, it was reported that prostaglandin I2
(PGI2) and the like are effective against hematogenous
metastasis of mouse tumors (see Science, Vol. 212, 1270,
(1981)). However, these compounds are unstable so that
they cannot be systemically administered as
pharmaceuticals.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is
to provide an antimetastasis agent of malignant tumors,
which effectively inhibits metastasis of malignant tumors
and which is safe.That is, the present invention provides an
antimetastasis agent of malignant tumors comprising as an 
effective ingredient beraprost or a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof.The antimetastasis agent according to the'present
invention prominently inhibits the metastasis of
malignant tumors and is safe. Further, it is chemically
stable.The compound name of beraprost which is used as an
antimetastasis agent of malignant tumors according to the
present invention is (Â±)-(1R*, 2R*, 3aS*, 8bS*)-2,3,3a,8b-tetrahydro-2-hydroxy-1-[(E)-(3S*)-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-1-octene-6-inyl]-1H-cyclopenta[b]benzofuran-5-butyric
acid.
This compound has the following structure.
Beraprost is described in Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application (Kokai) Nos. 58-32277, 57-144276 and 58-124778
and the like as a PGI2 derivative having a
structure in which the exoenol moiety characteristic to 
beraprost is converted to inter-m-phenylene structure.
However, it is not known that beraprost has an activity
to inhibit metastasis of malignant tumors.The beraprost which is an effective ingredient of
the agent of the present invention includes not only
racemic body, but also d-body and 1-body. Beraprost can
be produced by, for example, the method described in the
above-mentioned Japanese Laid-open Patent Application
(Kokai) No. 58-124778. The salts of beraprost include
any pharmaceutically acceptable salts including alkaline.
metal salts such as sodium salt and potassium salt;
alkaline earth metal salts such as magnesium salt and
calcium salt; ammonium salt; primary, secondary and
tertiary amine salts; and basic
