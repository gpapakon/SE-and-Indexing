<ABSTRACT>
A method of separating a gas-liquid mixture into its 
component parts which comprises urging the mixture 

through a coalescing filter (15) and thereby causing the 
liquid to be preferentially retained therein and the gas 

preferentially to pass therethrough, wherein the 
coalescing filter is mounted on a rotatable shaft (1) and the 

gas-liquid mixture is directed to the filter in a 
generally radial inward direction relative to the shaft 

and wherein retained liquid is spun in a generally radial 
outward direction from the filter by centrifugal force 

associated with the rotating filter (15) .

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for the separation of contaminant
materials from gas-liquid and/or gas solid aerosols or other gas-liquid mixtures and
their application to certain types of machinery.There are numerous instances where it is expedient to separate gas-liquid mixtures,
for example, where the gas is required to be separated from a "mist" of fine liquid
droplets either because of considerations of environmental cleanliness or because
one or both of the component parts of the mixture need to be recycled. It will also
be expedient in many instances to separate gas-liquid-solid mixtures (e.g. including
solids which are wear products of rotating machinery) and/or gas/vapour mixtures,
e.g. mixtures of air and a hydrocarbon vapour. Such mixtures, which can include
liquid and solid particles and possibly vapour, are generically referred to as
"polydispersed aerosols".Filters are known which can bring about such a separation. In particular, coalescing
filters are known in which a gas containing small suspended droplets of liquid such
as oil or the like - commonly referred to as a "mist" is separated and the liquid is
retained in the filter. Coalescing filters can be made from a variety of materials
including glass microfibres, especially borosilicate glass microfibres. It has recently
been proposed to surface treat the microfibres with a fluorochemical or other
material that imparts oleophobic and/or hydrophobic properties, and such treated
coalescing filters may also be usable for present purposes. Coalescing filters are
generally of annular or tubular shape and may be formed by moulding or pleating
sheets of microfibres. In the case of moulding, in particular, it may be desirable to
include a binder resin which also can modify the surface energy of the fibres, for
example, an epoxy resin or a silicone resin or a mixture or resins, to optimise
filtration efficiency. Coalescing filter elements are generally formed with a
mechanical support structure, for example, a layer of expanded metal, in contact 
with one or both of the surfaces of the coalescing filter element, and having sufficient
open area as not to interfere with the filter operation.DE-C-37 37 221 discloses an oil-air separator with a fixed housing and having a
rotor and an inwoard-flow tubular filter and an array of blocks which are spaced over
the circumference of the rotor and which act to throw oil particles outwards on to the
housing wall.This invention is based on the discovery that the use of rotary coalescing
