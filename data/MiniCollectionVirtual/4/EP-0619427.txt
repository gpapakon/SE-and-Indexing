<ABSTRACT>
Internal combustion engine for motor vehicles 
provided with at least one starter and one 

current generator connected to the drive shaft in 
order to start the engine and to generate the 

necessary electric energy for the engine to work, 
wherein the starter and the current generator are 

replaced by a brushless permanent magnet electric 
motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to internal combustion 
engines for motor vehicles provided with an 
electric starter and a current generator. One of 
the primary requirements in the designing of 
motor vehicles, in particular for so called "city 
cars", is to reduce the overall weight of the 
vehicle so that it can be driven using less power 
and therefore with less fuel consumption and less 
pollution. In current vehicles, to start the combustion 
engine and to generate the required levels of 
electric energy, two power units are used, a 
starter and a generator, which besides the cost, 
also have a significant impact on the total 
weight of the engine, both because of their 
weights and because of the connection systems and 
the transmission of movement to and from the 
combustion engine. The aim of this invention is to combine in a 
single electronic device the functions of the 
starter and of the current generator, simplifying 
at the same time the connection system to the 
combustion engine, as shown in document US-A-5 097 140. 
This and other aims are reached with an internal 
combustion engine according to claim 1.  
 Other characteristics and advantages will become 
clear from the following description which refers 
to the attached drawings, given by way of 
example only and in which: Figure 1 is a partial cross section view of an 
internal combustion engine provided with an 
electric motor according to the invention. Figure 2 is a cross section view of the electric 
motor manufactured in order to be mounted 
according to Figure 1. With reference to the figures, the numeral 1 
indicates an internal combustion engine 
(partially shown) provided with a crankshaft (3), 
and connecting rods (4) and pistons (5). The 
crankshaft rotates in the engine block (7) on 
smooth bearings (8). At the end (10) of the crankshaft (3), opposite 
to the end facing the gearbox, and therefore on 
the side usually called the distribution side, a  
 
gear (12) is splined, devoted to the operation of 
the engine distribution (camshaft). On the same 
side of the engine, a casing (14) is positioned 
around the end (10) of the crankshaft (3), fixed in 
a known way by means of bolts (not shown), which 
incorporates an inlet (15) for the feeding of 
lubricating oil into the engine. Said casing (14) 
is made in the form of a circular shell, 
coaxially mounted to the crankshaft to form, with 
the windings (17) integrally mounted, the stator 
(18) of a brushless permanent magnet motor, in 
which the polarity can be inverted at any
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
