<ABSTRACT>
A nonvolatile random access memory is disclosed having a substrate (50) carrying separate magnetically polarizable domains (19) each surrounded by a full write loop member (18) and arranged to penetrate the Hall channel (36) of a dual drain FET (16) with its residual magnetic field. The domains are organized in word rows and bit columns, are each written to by a single full write current through the surrounding loop member and each read by a comparator connected to the FET drains (42, 42'). The memory can be fabricated in a variety of forms (e.g. a planar card).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to nonvolatile random
access magnetic memories.A memory of this kind is described in WO 91/11006 and includes
fixed drive means for selectively generating magnetic
fields at selected locations to write bits into the domains
thereat (i.e. establish the ferromagnetic state of the domain)
comprising either a logical 1 or 0. The fixed drive
means generally comprises a plurality of word drive lines,
i.e. one for each word row, and a plurality of bit drive
lines, i.e. one for each bit in a word. In order to write a
bit into a particular domain, half magnitude select currents
are driven through both the word drive and bit drive lines
associated with that domain. The domain will switch states
only if the magnetic fields produced by the respective drive
currents act in the same direction.The structure of WO 91/11006 also includes fixed sensing
means for sensing the respective magnetic states of said domains.
In various embodiments described in said WO 91/11006,
the fixed sensing means comprise a Hall effect device with a
bipolar transistor disposed in proximity to the domain. The problem to be solved by the invention is to provide a
nonvolatile random access magnetic memory having a plurality
of magnetizable domains disposed at a corresponding plurality
of distinguishable locations on a substrate and characterized
by improved write structures.The invention solves this problem by the features of the independent
claim. Advantageous further developments are described
in the dependent claims. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a write
structure is provided comprised of a plurality of loop members, each loop
member surrounding a different one of said domains and being tightly
magnetically coupled thereto. Each loop member is uniquely connected
between a word write line and a bit write line which supply a full
magnitude select current to the loop member.The novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in
the appended claims. The invention will be best understood from the
following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying
drawings. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of elements of a memory cell embodiment,
in accordance with the present invention, arranged for embedding in a
substrate;FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a write structure embodiment
