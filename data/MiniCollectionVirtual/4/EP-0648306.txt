Chain-guided parking system, in particular 
paternoster-type garage, comprising at least 2 coaxially 

arranged chain-wheel pairs (1, 2) which are connected to 
one another by two circulating endless chains (3) which 

carry receiving means (14), for cars, which are fastened 
laterally in the chain-wheel plane via extension arms 

(4), in the case of which system, on each of the sides of 
the receiving means (14) which face the endless chains 

(3), there is arranged at least one carrying roller (6, 
9) which is mounted so as to be movable in each case in 

at least one slit (5, 8) of the extension arm (4), in the 
case of which each slit (5, 8) extends in the longitudinal 

direction of the extension arm (4) at least as far as 
the centre line of the endless chain (3) and each carrying 

roller (6, 9) is mounted so as to be movable over the 
entire length of each slit (5, 8), characterized in that, 

on each of the sides of the receiving means (14) which 
face the endless chains (3), each receiving means (14) 

has a guide roller (13) which, by means of the guide 
rails (10, 11, 12), in particular in the region of the 

chain wheels (1, 2), cause a change in position of the 
carrying rollers (6, 9), and thus of the receiving means 

(14), in the extension-arm slit (5, 8), the guide rails 
(10, 11, 12) in the region of the chain wheels moving the 

carrying rollers (6, 9) first of all in the vertical 
direction and then inwards in the direction of the axis 

of the chain-wheel pair (1, 2). 
Chain-guided parking system, in particular 
paternoster-type garage, according to Claim 1, characterized 

in that, on at least one side of the receiving means  
 

(14), there are arranged two carrying rollers (9) which 
are located vertically with respect to one another and 

are mounted in two extension-arm slits (8), the shape of 
the slits being such that, throughout the circulation of 

the chain, the carrying rollers (9) necessarily remain 
vertically one above the other. 
Chain-guided parking system, in particular 
paternoster-type garage, according to Claim 1, characterized 

in that the slit (5) runs along the extension arm 
(4) and, on the chain side, is widened slightly in the 

axial direction of the chain. 
Chain-guided parking system, in particular 
paternoster-type garage, according to one or more of 

Claims 1-3, characterized in that two chain-wheel pairs 
(1, 2) are arranged vertically one above the other, and 

vehicle-carrying cages (14) are fastened, via the extension 
arms (4, 7), on the vertically running endless 

chains (3). 
Chain-guided parking system, in particular 
paternoster-type garage, according to one of Claims 1-4, 

characterized in that the guide rails (10, 11) have a 
horizontal section. 
Chain-guided parking system, in particular 
paternoster-type garage, according to one or more of 

Claims 1-5, characterized in that one side of the receiving 
means (14) is retained by an extension arm (7) with 

slits according to Claim 2 and the other side is retained 
by an extension arm (4) with a slot according to Claim 3. 
Chain-guided parking system, in particular 
paternoster-type garage, according to one or more of 

Claims 1-6, characterized in that the extension arms 
(25), including the slits (5, 8), extend in the chain-wheel 

plane, on either side of the endless chain (3). 
Chain-guided parking system, in particular 
paternoster-type garage, according to one of Claims 1-7, 

characterized in that guide rails (23, 24) are arranged 
over the entire length of horizontally guided chain 

sections of the endless chain (3). 
Chain-guided parking system, in particular  
 

paternoster-type garage, according to one or more of 
Claims 1-8, characterized in that the axes of the guide 

rollers (13) are arranged to be offset, on the one hand, 
upwards and, on t
he other hand, downwards in the vertical 
direction with respect to the carrying rollers (6, 9), 

and the guide rails (10, 11, 12) are arranged to be 
offset correspondingly, on the one hand, upwards and, on 

the other hand, downwards in the vertical direction with 
respect to the axis of the chain-wheel pairs (1, 2). 
Chain-guided parking system, in particular 
paternoster-type garage, according to one or more of 

Claims 1-9, characterized in that the axes of the guide 
rollers (13) are arranged to be offset, on the one hand, 

to the left and, on the other hand, to the right in the 
horizontal direction with respect to the carrying rollers 

(6, 9), and the guide rails (10, 11, 12) are arranged to 
be offset correspondingly, on the one hand, to the left 

and, on the other hand, to the right in the horizontal 
direction with respect to the axis of the chain-wheel 

pairs (1, 2). 
Chain-guided parking system, in particular 
paternoster-type garage, according to one or more of 

Claims 1-10, characterized in that each receiving means 
(14) has supporting rollers (26) running on supporting 

rails (16, 17) which are arranged to be offset in parallel 
with the horizontal sections of the guide rails (10,
