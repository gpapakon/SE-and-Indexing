<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates a communication terminal for the
synchronisation of audio and visual information within a communication

system. Audio communication between the parties to a video conference is
achieved by digitising the speech and transmitting the same over a packet

based data network. Each party to the conference can draw the attention
of the other party to an object on the screen using a pointer controlled

by, say, a mouse or ball. The co-ordinates of each parties' pointer are
incorporated, via a multiplexer, into the data packets containing the

digitised speech and transmitted to the other party's terminal thereby
ensuring the synchronisation the pointer information with the digitised

speech.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication terminal for use in a
communication or video conferencing system.Video conferencing systems facilitate interactive collaborative working
between individuals at different locations using computers as a
communication tool. Within conventional video conferencing systems, the
users may have separate data and audio links. Data relating to the
application upon which the users are collaboratively working in
conjunction with visual data, representing the images of the parties, are
exchanged via a packet based data network. The audio and data links are
conventionally established using a telephone network and packet based
data network respectively (cf. e.g WO-A-93/08522).The interactions involved during collaborative working may relate to, for
example, discussing the financial planning aspects of a project; for
which the parties have a financial model and manipulate using, say, a
spread sheet on a chalk board in the conventional manner. Each party
would have copy of the relevant financial model on the screen of their
communication terminal or video conferencing terminal. However, only one
party will have total control over the operation of the model, that is,
only one party will be able to effect changes to the model. Discussions
and interactions take place using the data and audio links. An addressor
draws the attention of an addressee to a particular aspect of the model
using a pointer controlled by, say, a mouse or other suitable input
device. The pointers of both parties are displayed on both terminal
screens simultaneously. The simultaneous display of the pointers on the
screens of both parties is effected by exchanging pointer location co-ordinates
over the packet based data network. The packet based data
network can be either switched or non-switched. In order that the
parties to the conference perceive the system as being real-time and as
having an interactive feeling the pointer location co-ordinates need to
be exchanged approximately fifteen to twenty-five times per second.The exchange of co-ordinates in existing systems is also usually effected 
via the packet based data network. This is to be contrasted with the
exchange of audio information via a telephone network. Referring to the
latter, the communication is almost instantaneous whereas with the former
there is invariably an end-to-end delay or network latency.
Consequently, a scenario can be envisaged in which an addressor attempts
to draw the attention of an addressee to a particular aspect of the
