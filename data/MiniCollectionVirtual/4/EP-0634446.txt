<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vinylidene fluoride 
("VDF") polymers having a reduced smoke-generating 
capability upon ignition and having an increased 
resistance to ignition (limiting oxygen index or "LOI"), 
particularly to compositions containing VDF polymers 
having calcium tungstate dispersed therein. One of the notable characteristics of fluorinated 
polymers is their relatively low susceptibility to 
burning and the low level of smoke generated in such  
 
situations as compared with other polymers. This 
characteristic has been utilized in the wire and cable 
industry, among others, and more specifically in plenum 
cable constructions and fiber optic cable applications. 
Fluoropolymers have LOI values ranging from the 40's to 
the 90's, as determined by ASTM D-2863, with the higher 
index numbers being achieved by the least flammable 
polymers. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based resins 
normally have LOI values in the lower end of that range. 
Thus, reducing the smoke density and increasing the flame 
retardancy of the VDF polymers is a desirable goal. The 
cable constructions would then exhibit a greater 
tolerance to the inclusion of non-fluorinated components. Other candidates have been tried for enhancing flame 
retardation and reduced smoke, such as kaolin clay (U.S. 
Patent 4,804,702), but are only moderately successful. 
An improved retardant is highly desirable. The text of 
U.S. 4,804,702 is incorporated herein by reference for 
its teaching of typical cable constructions employing 
such VDF polymers. A low smoke and flame retardant composition 
comprising a VDF polymer and from about 0.02 to about 
2.00 percent by weight of calcium tungstate, based on  
 
the weight of the composition, is provided, the polymer 
optionally containing other additives such as 
polytetrafluoroethylene ("PTFE"). It has now been found that incorporation of a small 
amount of calcium tungstate into a VDF polymer results in 
a significant improvement in the smoke and flame 
properties of the polymer, making it especially useful 
for cable constructions. The "VDF polymer" refers not only to the 
homopolymers of VDF but also to the copolymers prepared 
from at least about 80% by weight of VDF monomer. 
Comonomers may include other fluorinated monomers such as 
hexafluoropropylene ("HFP"), tetrafluoroethylene ("TFE"), 
and vinyl fluoride. Preferred are the homopolymers and 
the copolymers prepared from VDF and HFP to which small 
amounts (up to about 5 weight percent, preferably about 
0.01 to about 0.05
