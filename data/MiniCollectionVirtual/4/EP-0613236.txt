<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for operating an electric motor drive (4) of a compressor (3) of a cooling unit for electrical, especially electronic switch cabinets (1). Means are provided for voltage supply and, furthermore, for setting the voltage supply to the drive motor to its rated voltage range. In order to ensure with a small additional space requirement and low additional procurement costs that such an electric motor drive can also be supplied from mains supply networks whose rated voltages are very different from one another, it is provided that the arrangement has an additional voltage source (5) in parallel with the mains connection (L, N) of the drive motor (4), the output voltage range of which voltage source (5) is at least equal to the voltage range between the maximum possible deviations in the mains voltages in question on the one hand from the rated voltage or the rated voltage +/- its tolerance limits on the other side of the drive motor, and that means (6) are provided for connecting the additional voltage source to the drive motor by hand or preferably automatically.

An arrangement for operating an electromotor drive of 
a compressor of a refrigerating unit for electric, in 

particular electronic, switch cabinets, having means for 
voltage supply and also for setting the voltage supplied to 

the driving motor over its rated voltage range, 
characterised in that parallel to the mains power supply 

(L, N) of the driving motor (4) the arrangement has an 
additional voltage source (5), whose output voltage range 

is at least equal to the voltage range between the maximum 
possible voltage values of the possible mains voltages on 

the one hand and the rated voltage or the rated voltage Â± 
its tolerance limits of the driving motor on the other 

hand , and in that means (6) are provided for the manual or 
preferably automatically occurring connection of the 

additional voltage source to the driving motor. 
An arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the additional voltage source is a transformer (5), 

which is supplied on the primary side with mains voltage 
(L, N) and on the secondary side (9) forms the additional 

voltage source. 
An arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the structural size of the additional 

voltage source is matched to the power to be supplied 
thereby. 
An arrangement according to claim 2 and 3,  
 

characterised in that the dimensions of the primary winding 
(8) of the transformer (5) and the dimensions of the 

winding space of the primary winding are matched to the 
power to be supplied by the additional voltage source and 

the current in the primary winding required therefor. 
An arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the output voltage of the additional 

voltage source (5) can be set at varying values. 
An arrangement according to claim 5, characterised by 
a regulation or control of the output voltage of the 

additional voltage source. 
An arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised by switching means (6), by means of which the 

output voltage of the additional voltage source (5) either 
with the same polarity or with opposite polarity to the 

mains voltage can be added thereto. 
An arrangement according to claim 7, characterised by 
an interchange of the connections of the voltage outputs 

(18, 19) of the additional voltage source with feeding 
points of a line train leading from one phase (L) to the 

driving motor (4). 
An arrangement according to claim 8, characterised in 
that two switches can be switched alternately into one 

switching position (14, 15) or into a second switching 
position (14', 15') in order to achieve the respective  

 
addition or subtraction of the voltage of the additional 

voltage source. 
An arrangement according to claim 1 to 9, 
characterised by an inducible switching position of a 

switching means (12) so that the drive motor (4) is 
connected directly to the mains (L, N).
