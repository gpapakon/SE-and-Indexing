<ABSTRACT>
A multilayer test strip includes a first 
layer having an indicator reagent within a porous 

substrate, a second layer, overlying the first 
layer, including a reactive reagent, and a third 

layer, overlying the second layer, including a 
spreading agent that promotes the spreading of a 

liquid upon the third layer. Alternatively, the 
spreading agent may be mixed into the second layer. 

An inert backing with an aperture therethrough is 
positioned over these layers, with the substrate 

remote from the cover layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a test strip for
use in testing liquids, and, more particularly, to a
multilayer test strip of particular value in optical
reflectance testing for the amount of glucose in
blood by contacting a sample of the blood to the
test strip.A reagent-containing test strip provides a
convenient and easy approach for conducting certain
types of chemical analysis. The test strip is
normally prepared. by impregnating a porous material
with a solution containing the reagent, and
optionally other ingredients. This step is readily
accomplished by dipping the porous material into the
reagent solution. The test strip and solution are
dried to fix the reagent in the porous matrix.
Additional reagents may be added by impregnating the
porous material with additional solutions containing
the additional reagents and drying the porous
material after each further treatment.To conduct a test using the test strip, a
liquid that may contain an active species is
contacted with the test strip. The liquid dissolves
reagents that were previously introduced into the
porous material, so that these reagents can mix with
each other and with the active species, if present.
The subsequent reaction is selected to cause some
measurable change in the test strip. For example,
if one of the reagents is a dye, the test strip can
be made to change color responsive to the presence
of the reactive species.A test strip may be used in several ways.
One common approach is to dip the test strip into a 
sample of the liquid to be tested, and to thereafter
observe the behavior of the test strip. In another
approach, a droplet of the liquid is placed onto the
test strip. The test strip is observed either with
the eye or with an instrument structured and
calibrated to make accurate measurements of the test
strip.In one such approach, described in US Patent
4,935,346, a test strip is affixed to an inert
backing that has an aperture therethrough to the
test strip. A droplet of a liquid to be analyzed,
preferably blood in the case of the '346 patent, is
placed in the aperture through the backing. The
blood penetrates into a first side of the test
strip, reacting with reagents in the test strip.
The reagents include a dye that colors responsive to
the presence of a particular active species in the
liquid.As this test is performed, the test strip and
the backing are held in a measurement instrument
that directs a light beam against an opposite,
second side of the test strip. The light reflected
from the second side is measured. Changes
