<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and an apparatus for purifying air, contaminated air being brought into contact with a reactive liquid depending on the contaminants to be removed and/or being brought into contact with oxidising gas portions and with catalysts. The object of the invention, improving a process of the generic type so that inexpensive and highly effective purification of air is made possible, in particular of pollutants selected from the groups consisting of hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, acids and acid anhydrides, esters, halogenated hydrocarbon compounds and inorganic and organic gases, so that, for example, the national conditions of environmental authorities are also complied with, and creating a suitable apparatus, is achieved by passing the contaminated air over distributor screens through a bulk packing of special zeolite granules into which is fed a controlled mixture of hydrogen peroxide and desalinated water, hydrogen peroxide and free radical oxygen being given off as gas from the zeolite granules and leading to intensified oxidation of the pollutants in the air.
