<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ring/traveller system for spinning and twisting machines. To improve the service life, increase the production speed and have more efficiency, it is proposed   - that at least the surface of the ring (1) coming into contact with the traveller (2) consist of a polycrystalline ceramic, - that the ceramic surface of the ring (1) have a surface structure with rounded grain boundaries, which forms a storage volume for a self-forming fibre lubrication film, and - that the traveller (2) consist of an elastic carrier material, especially metal, and have a metallic and/or ceramic surface, the hardness of which is greater than or equal to the hardness of the ceramic surface of the ring (1).

Ring/traveller system for spinning and twisting 
machines, at least that surface of the ring (1) which 

comes into contact with the traveller (2) consisting of 
a polycrystalline ceramic, characterized 


in that the ceramic surface of the ring (1) has a 
surface structure with rounded grain boundaries which 

forms a storage volume for a self-forming fibre lubricating 
film, and 
in that the traveller (2) consists of an elastic 
carrier material, especially metal, and has a metallic 

and/or ceramic surface, the hardness of which is greater 
than or equal to the hardness of the ceramic surface of 

the ring (1). 
Ring/traveller system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the ring (1) consists completely of 

ceramic. 
Ring/traveller system according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the surface structure of the 

ceramic surface of the ring (1) is produced by means of 
a subsequent mechanical, chemical or thermal treatment 

process or by means of a combination of these. 
Ring/traveller system according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the hardness of the ceramic 

surface of the ring (1) is approximately 80 Rockwell C. 
Ring/traveller system according to one of Claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that the core peak-to-valley 

height of the ceramic surface of the ring (1) is between 

0.2 and 2 Âµm. 
Ring/traveller system according to Claims 1 to 5,  
 

characterized in that the metallic surface of the 
traveller (2) has no solubility and no tendency to 

diffusion in relation to the ceramic surface of the ring 
(1). 
Ring/traveller system according to one of Claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that the mutually confronting 

faces of the ring (1) and of the traveller (2) have 
different radii of curvature, the radius of curvature 

(r
2
) of the ring (1) being small than the radius of 
curvature (r
1
) of the traveller (2), so that approximately 
punctiform contact takes place. 
Ring/traveller system according to one of Claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that the ceramic surface of the 

ring (1), or the ring (1) is selected from one of the 
following ceramics: 


oxides of Al, Si, Zr and their mixtures;
 
SiC, Si

elements of the IVth, Vth and VIth secondary groups 
of elements and their mixtures. 
Ring/traveller system according to one of Claims 
1 to 8, characterized in that the metallic and/or ceramic 

surface of the traveller (2) consists of one of the 
following materials: 


chromium, vanadium and their mixtures;
 
carbides, nitrides, borides and silicides of the 

elements of the IVth, Vth and VIth secondary groups 
of elements and their mixtures;
