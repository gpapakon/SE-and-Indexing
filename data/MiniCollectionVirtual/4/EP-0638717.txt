<ABSTRACT>
A device for controlling the fuel injection and the ignition in an internal combustion engine is described, in which the position of the crankshaft and camshaft is determined in the control module as soon as possible after switching on the internal combustion engine. For this purpose the output signals of a crankshaft and a camshaft sensor are evaluated, the crankshaft sensor detecting at least one reference mark and the camshaft sensor having a sensor disc, which has a marking, which extends over an angle of 180 DEG . The co-ordination between crankshaft and camshaft must be such that the change in the level of the camshaft sensor signal is situated as precisely as possible between two reference marks. It is then possible to produce four marks, which are used to transmit the first injection and ignition signals, it being possible to run additional plausibility checks.

Apparatus for controlling the fuel injection
and the ignition in an internal combustion engine

having a computing device in which the angular position
of the crank shaft and of the cam shaft is determined

by evaluating the corresponding sensor signals, in
order to form control signals for the injection valves

and in order to trigger ignitions, in which case, in
order to determine the position of the cam shaft, a

disc which is connected to the cam shaft and which has
an angular mark which extends over 180Â° is sensed, and

there is at least one reference mark on the crank shaft
or on a disc assigned to the crank shaft, and the crank

shaft and the cam shaft are assigned to one another in
such a way that the change in levels of the cam shaft

sensor signal occurs approximately in the centre
between two reference marks, in each case one mark M1

to M4 being formed from the reference mark of the crank
shaft's sensor signal and each signal from edge change

of the cam shaft sensor signal per working cycle of the
internal combustion engine and being used to form the

injection signals, characterized in that when the
internal combustion engine is started, the first

injection begins in synchronism with one of the marks
(M1 to M4), the injections being positioned in

accordance with the position of the internal combustion
engine in such a way that short starting times are

achieved. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the computing apparatus is the control device

of the internal combustion engine.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the selection of the cylinder,

which is operated with the first injection, is made on
a temperature-dependent basis.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that starting from the marks

(M1 to M4) ignition outputs are determined which do not
output until the reference mark and a change of phase

are detected, the sequence of the occurrence of the
corresponding signals not being taken into account.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that in 4, 6, 8 or 12

cylinder engines, the first ignition outputs take place
already after the detection of a change in phase or

after the reference mark without previous checks.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that after the

synchronization, a change-over to a customary cylinder-specific
injection without incorrect or double

injections, in particular the so-called SEFI takes
place.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the control unit has

means which, after the switching off of the ignition of
the internal combustion engine, stores, during a

running-on phase, the sensor signal or the sensor
signals up to the time when the crank shaft and the cam

shaft come to a standstill, and makes them available
again when the ignition is switched on again.
