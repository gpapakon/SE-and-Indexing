<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a supporting structure for the roofing and/or exterior cladding of buildings, having a support arrangement fastened on the building and supporting and fastening elements which are fitted on the support arrangement, such that they jut out therefrom, and are intended for connection, load transfer and fixing of preferably metal, profiled cladding webs with overlapping profiles on both sides. The supporting structure comprises a support arrangement which is produced from profiled material, is fastened, via a fastening flange, on the building surface to be covered, and on which there is formed a supporting rail (26) with longitudinal strips (26a, 26b), integrally formed on both sides, for receiving a number of slide webs, from which retaining clips (10) jut out perpendicularly. Integrally formed at the free end of the retaining clips is in each case one supporting profile (40), the lateral overlapping profiles of adjacent cladding webs engaging over or around said supporting profile preferably in a resilient manner, this resulting in a reliable connection which can be subjected to loading and is sealed with respect to the penetration of moisture. The combination of different embodiments of support arrangements with different embodiments of slide webs gives rise to possibilities of varying application in accordance with defined specifications. In this arrangement, production and mounting are simple and cost-effective.

<CLAIMS>
Supporting structure for the covering ad/or the cladding of
buildings using an assembly of supports, fixed to the building,

which consists of spacing supporting webs (2) comprising
two paralleled longitudinal strips (26a, 26b), spaced from each

other, grippable from below at both sides and forming flat supporting
flanges onto which some sliding links can be set or slipped,

the latter having high-standing clips (10) provided with
supporting profiles (40), shaped at their free ends, said links

embracing the longitudinal strips (26a, 26b) of the supporting
flanges at both sides and gripping them from below using some

profile guides (30a, 30b),

characterized in

that the sliding link shows a two-wing link plate and, further,
that each one of link plate wings (34a, 34b), opposite to each

other, has been provided with one pair each of profile guides
(30a, 30b) to embrace and grip the supporting flange (26a, 26b)

from below, the directions of said guides being swept by an angle
'a', between 30 and 60Â°, one against the other, and one pair of 

guides (30b) being located at opposite projections (34a', 34b')
and, moreover, that the link plate wings (34a, 34b) have been

attached by a high-standing clip (10).
Supporting structure according to claim 1, characterized

in that the supporting profile of the clips (10) essentially
shows the profile of a triangle with rounded-off corners and,

further, that the lateral faces have some neckings.
Supporting structure according to claim 1, characterized

in that the supporting flange (26) and its longitudinal strips
(26a, 26b) have been attached to the assembly A by supporting

web (2) having at least one lower fixing flange (3) arranged
rectangular to this web.
Supporting structure according to claim 1, characterized

in that the supporting flange (26) and its longitudinal strips
(26a, 26b) have been attached to the assembly R by two spaced

supporting webs (52) with one pertaining lower fixing flange (53)

each, arranged at a certain angle.
Supporting structure according to claim 3 or 4, characterized
in that the supporting web (2) or the supporting webs

(52) and the supporting flange (26) with its longitudinal strips
(26a, 26b) have been made of plain sheet duly cut to size and

folded.
Supporting structure according to claim 5, characterized

in that by further folding (A3) the supporting web(s) (2, 52),
the lower fixing flange(s) (3, 53) has (have) also been made of

plain sheet duly cut to size.
