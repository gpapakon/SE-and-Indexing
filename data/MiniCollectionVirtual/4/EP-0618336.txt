<ABSTRACT>
A supporting means for a load-bearing surface which is made up in a modular manner from prefabricated elements, and in particular a lightweight-construction parking deck, comprises a vertical support (4), whose lower end is supported on a supporting foot (5). The supporting foot bears, by means of load-distributing surfaces (13) formed on its underside, without foundation on the underlying surface (11) and has a hollow (14), on whose base (15) a load-bearing plate (21) bears. In order to design the supporting means such that, even after it has been positioned on the underlying surface, restricted adaptation to unevennesses in the ground is possible, the support (4) is supported on the load-bearing plate (21) via elements (23) which are each arranged offset from the centre of the longitudinal axis of the support (4) and of which the effective lengths can be adjusted independently of one another. The length-adjustable elements (23) are, for example, threaded rods which are supported on a supporting plate (24) which terminates the support (4) towards the bottom and is connected fixedly thereto.
