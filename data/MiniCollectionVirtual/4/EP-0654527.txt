A method for degumming vegetable oil, in which the
vegetable oil is adjusted to a pH value of 3 to 6, an

aqueous enzyme solution which contains one of the
enzymes phospholipase A1, A2 or B is dispersed in the

oil, the enzymes are allowed to act in the oil, with
stirring, at temperatures of 20 to 90째C in a degumming

reactor and degummed oil is separated off from the
liquid withdrawn from the degumming reactor,

characterised in that a separation promoter or a
solubiliser is added to the liquid withdrawn from the

degumming reactor at temperatures of 20 to 90째C before
or after the degummed oil has been separated off, and

an aqueous, largely sludge-free solution containing
spent enzymes is obtained which is recycled at least in

part to a location before the degumming reactor and is
dispersed in the oil to be degummed, the proportion of

spent, recycled enzymes in the total quantity of
enzymes dispersed in the oil being at least 10%.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that degummed oil is separated off from the liquid

withdrawn from the degumming reactor and in so doing a
water/sludge phase is obtained in which separation

promoter is dispersed at temperatures in the range from
20 to 90째C, the water/sludge phase being stirred in a

detention tank, an aqueous, largely sludge-free phase
containing spent enzymes is separated off from the

stirred water/sludge phase and recycled at least in
part to a location before the degumming reactor.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that degummed oil is separated off from the liquid

withdrawn from the degumming reactor and in so doing a
water/sludge phase is obtained to which solubiliser is 

added at temperatures in the range from 20 to 90째C,
and, with stirring, an aqueous, largely sludge-free

phase containing spent enzymes is produced which is
recycled at least in part to a location before the

degumming reactor.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that solubiliser is added to the liquid withdrawn from

the degumming reactor, the liquid is passed through a
separating means and degummed oil and, separately

therefrom, an aqueous, largely sludge-free solution
containing spent enzymes is obtained, the solution

being recycled at least in part to a location before
the degumming reactor.
A method according to Claim 1 or one of the
following claims, characterised in that


a) polyethylene-sugar-fatty acid ester,
b) ricinus ethoxylate,
c) ethoxylated palmitate,
d) ethoxylated synthetic primary alcohol,
e) ethoxylated lauryl alcohol,
f) ethoxylated tallow fatty alcohol or
g) hydrophobic surfactant

are used as separation promoter and solubiliser.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that at least


h) one anion-active compound or
i) one non-ionogenic compound

is used as separation promoter. 
A method according to Claim 1 or one of the
following claims, characterised in that the separation

promoter or the solubiliser is added in a quantity of
0.1 to 100 g per litre of liquid.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the proportion of spent enzymes

in the total quantity of enzymes dispersed in the oil
to be degummed is at least 20%.
