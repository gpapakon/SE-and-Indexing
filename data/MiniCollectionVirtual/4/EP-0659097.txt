<ABSTRACT>
A dual-lumen blood-treatment catheter (1) comprises two lumina (4, 5) which open towards the patient end of the catheter for removal and return of blood to the patient. The catheter has expandable means (8, 60) towards the patient end of the catheter for atraumatically preventing collapse of a vessel into which the catheter is inserted so as to ensure free flow of blood into and out of the catheter. The two lumina may be an outer lumen (4) and an inner lumen (5), the inner lumen (5) extending within the outer lumen (4). The outer lumen (4) has a plurality of slits (7) around its circumference which form slats (8) therebetween. Withdrawal of the inner lumen (5) relative to the outer lumen (4) causes the slits (7) to open, thereby bowing the slats (8) to expand the outer lumen.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A DUAL-LUMEN CATHETERThe present invention relates to a dual-lumen catheter. The dual-lumen catheter of the present invention has particular application for haemodialysis.Dual-lumen catheters have been proposed for use in haemodialysis and are inserted into a vein, usually the jugular, subclavian or femoral vein. Such dual-lumen catheters have a first, arterial lumen through which blood is withdrawn from the vein. The blood is pumped round a dialysis filtration circuit and returned to the vein through a second, venous lumen of the catheter.A dual-lumen haemodialysis catheter is usually fixed in situ on the patient for about two weeks, although in some instances the catheter may be in situ for up to eight months. The catheter is normally only removed when treatment is no longer required or in case of infection at the insertion site or due to catheter malfunction.With such catheters, particularly when used in children, who have relatively narrower and weaker veins than adults, and/or when the catheter is in situ for a relatively long period, collapse of the vein in which the catheter is inserted is a real problem, particularly because it can cause the catheter to be blocked and in any event reduces the efficiency of the catheter and may prevent the catheter from working altogether.According to the present invention, there is provided a dual-lumen catheter comprising an outer lumen and an inner lumen which are joined at an insertion end of the catheter, the inner lumen lying within the outer lumen, the outer lumen being expandable for atraumatically preventing collapse of a vessel into which the catheter is inserted.The outer lumen provides a support which prevents collapse of the vessel into which the catheter is inserted. The outer lumen need not necessarily be expanded so far that it contacts the vessel; rather, it will usually be sufficient that the outer lumen be expanded slightly so 

that it will keep the vessel open should the vessel begin to collapse.Preferably, the outer lumen has a plurality of slits around its circumference which forms slats therebetween, withdrawal of the inner lumen relative to the outer lumen causing the slits to open thereby bowing the slats to expand the outer lumen.The use of slits provides a simple mechanism for allowing the outer lumen to be expanded. The slits may also provide an opening through which blood can enter the outer (arterial) lumen.Means are preferably provided for controllably withdrawing the inner lumen relative to the outer lumen.The withdrawing means

CLAIMS
1. A dual-lumen blood-treatment catheter (1) comprising two lumina (4,5) which open towards the patient end of the catheter for removal and return of blood to the patient, the catheter having expandable means (8,60) towards the patient end of the catheter for atraumatically preventing collapse of a vessel into which the catheter is inserted so as to ensure free flow of blood into and out of the catheter.
2. A catheter according to claim 1, wherein the expanded diameter of the expandable means (8,60) is less than the external diameter of the blood vessel in which it is inserted.
3. A catheter according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the two lumina are an outer lumen (4) and an inner lumen (5) , the inner lumen (5) extending within the outer lumen (4).
4. A catheter according to claim 3, wherein the outer and inner lumina (4,5) are joined at an insertion end (6) of the catheter (1) .
5. A catheter according to claim 3 or claim 4, wherein the expandable means (8,60) is formed as part of the outer lumen (4) .
6. A catheter according to claim 5, wherein the outer lumen (4) has a plurality of slits (7) around its circumference which form slats (8) therebetween, withdrawal of the inner lumen (5) relative to the outer lumen (4) causing the slits (7) to open thereby bowing the slats (8) to expand the outer lumen. 


7. A catheter according to claim 6, wherein the slats (8) have a relatively thinner portion to facilitate bowing of the slats.
8. A catheter according to claim 6 or claim 7, further comprising means (20,50) for controllably withdrawing the inner lumen relative to the outer lumen.
9. A catheter according to claim 8, wherein the withdrawing means comprises a linear mechanism (50) .
10. A catheter according to claim 9, wherein the linear withdrawing mechanism (50) is a ratchet mechanism (51,52,53) .
11. A catheter according to claim 8, wherein the withdrawing means comprises a rotary mechanism (20) .
12. A catheter according to claim 11, wherein the rotary withdrawing mechanism (20) comprises a screw thread (21) on the inner lumen (5) and a nut (22) threaded on said inner lumen screw thread, the nut being rotatable on said screw thread to withdraw and to advance the inner lumen relative to the outer lumen.
13. A catheter according to any of claims 5 to 12, wherein the outer and inner lumina are connected to a hub (3) having a substantially Y-shape channel.
14. A catheter according to claim 13, when dependent on claim 11 or claim 12, wherein the inner lumen is constrained against rotating in the hub.
15. A catheter according to claim 5, wherein the outer lumen includes at least one sac (60) which may be pressurised to expand the outer lumen.
