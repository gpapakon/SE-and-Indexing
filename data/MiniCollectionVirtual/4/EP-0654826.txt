<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, a first substrate (20) is fabricated in which at least a first photodetection element (22) is formed, sensitive to a first waveband, and a second substrate (24) is fabricated, in which at least one second photodetection element (26) is formed, sensitive to a second wave band. The second substrate equipped with the second photodetection element is transparent to at least the first waveband and the first element is placed facing the second one, in the vicinity of the latter. The first and second substrates are linked to one another by electrical and/or mechanical connection beads. Application to thermal imaging.
