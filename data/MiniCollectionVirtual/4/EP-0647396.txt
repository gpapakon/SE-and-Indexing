<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an inter-line fishing rod 
which can hold annular fishline guide members positively on the 

inner surface of a rod tube. The inter-line fishing rod 
includes annular fishline guide members (30) respectively 

mounted on the inner surface of a rod tube (12) formed of fiber 
reinforced synthetic resin. The fishing rod is arranged such 

that minute projections (36) are provided on the outer 
periphery of the fishline guide members (30) facing the inner 

surface (12S) of the rod tube (12), and the minute projections 
(36) are pressed against the rod tube inner surface (12S).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inter-line fishing
rod in which a fishline is at least partially passed through
the inside of a rod tubeIn Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. Sho. 56-127032,
there is disclosed an inter-line type fishing rod
having a large number of annular members which are fixed to the
inside of a rod tube to define a fishline guide passage.
According to the disclosure of the present publication, since
the rod tube includes a tapered inner surface, the annular
members can be settled at their respective given positions by
the action of the casting operation and also they may be
adhesively fixed at those positions as the need arises.However, even when the annular members are held at
their respective given positions by the action of the casting
operation while they are not adhesively fixed, the annular
members can drop down due to some shocks, tension of the
fishline, loads caused by the movement of the fishline, and
influences given by the bending of the rod tube when the rear
portion of the rod tube is located down. Even if the annular
members are adhesively fixed, the fixture cannot be stabilized.
This is because, when a rod tube is produced, a surface
lubricant is applied onto the surface of a core metal and part
of the surface lubricant can often be left on the inner surface 
of the produced rod tube, which hinders the stable adhesive
fixture of the annular members.In view of the above, it is an object of the invention
to provide an inter-line fishing rod in which a plurality of
fishline guide members can be held on the inner surface of a
rod tube.In attaining the above object, the present invention
provides an inter-line fishing rod which can hold annular
fishline guide members positively on the inner surface of a rod
tube.More specifically, the present invention provides, as
a first aspect thereof, an inter-line fishing rod which
includes: a rod tube designed to permit a fishline to at least
partially pass through an inside thereof, the rod tube having
an inner surface; and an annular fishline guide member having
at least one minute projection formed on an outer periphery
thereof facing the inner surface of the rod, wherein the minute
projection is pressed against the inner surface of the rod tube
when the annular fishline guide member is located at a
predetermined position with respect to the rod tube so as to
retain the annular fishline guide member in the predetermined
position.The present invention further provides, as a second
aspect thereof, an inter-line fishing rod
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An inter-line fishing rod comprising:

a rod tube designed to permit a fishline to at least
partially pass through an inside thereof, said rod tube having

an inner surface; and
an annular fishline guide member having at least one
minute projection formed on an outer periphery thereof facing

said inner surface of said rod, wherein said minute projection
is pressed against said inner surface of said rod tube when

said annular fishline guide member is located at a
predetermined position with respect to said rod tube so as to

retain said annular fishline guide member in said predetermined
position.
An inter-line fishing rod according to claim 1,
wherein said minute projection include a slippage preventive

claw directed to bite said inner surface of said rod tube when
said annular fishline guide member is displaced from said

predetermined position.
An inter-line fishing rod according to claim 2,
wherein said slippage preventive claw is made of metal

material.
An inter-line fishing rod according to claim 1,
wherein said rod tube includes a fiber-reinforced synthetic

layer and a relatively soft film layer made of synthetic resin
and formed on said fiber-reinforced resin layer to define said 

inner surface, wherein said minute projection is in pressure
contact with and bites said soft film layer.
An inter-line fishing rod according to claim 4,
wherein said soft film layer is located as said predetermined

position.
An inter-line fishing rod comprising:

a rod tube designed to permit a fishline to at least
partially pass through an inside thereof, said rod tube having

an inner surface; and
an annular fishline guide member mounted on said inner
surface of said rod tube, wherein:
said rod tube is formed with a small diameter portion
on a portion of said inner surface to retain said annular

fishline guide member in a predetermined position.
An inter-line fishing rod according to claim 6,
wherein said small diameter portion is integrally and

simultaneously formed when said rod pipe is formed, and located
behind said predetermined position, and wherein said small

diameter portion is elastically deformable to permit said
annular fishline guide member to pass therethroug
h to said
predetermined position.
An inter-line fishing rod according to claim 6,
wherein said rod tube includes a soft film layer defining said

inner surface, and wherein said soft film layer is radially
outwardly depressed and deformed by said annular fishline guide

member to thereby define said small diameter portion in front 
of and behind said annular fishline guide member located at

said predetermined position.
An inter-line fishing rod according to claim 6,
wherein an additional annular member is attached to said inner

surface to define said small diameter portion behind said
annular fishline guide member located at said predetermined

position.
An inter-line fishing rod according to claim 6,
wherein said small diameter portion is engaged with a recess

formed on an outer periphery of said annular fishline guide
member.
