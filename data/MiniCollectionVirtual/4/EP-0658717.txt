<ABSTRACT>
An evacuated thermal-insulation element in the form of a container has its cavity filled with a supporting means (4) which is assigned an air-permeable mat (3). In order to simplify the processing of the supporting means, it is enclosed in a porous bag (8) which is inserted between a wall surface (2) and the mat (3).

Refrigerator and/or freezer appliance, having a vacuum insulation moulded
body and therein a cavity, which is evacuated and filled with a heat-insulating,

powdered support agent (4) between wall faces spaced
adjacent to one another and joined together at the periphery in a vacuum-tight

manner, wherein between one wall face and the support agent an air-permeable
matting (3) and a pump discharge nozzle (14) are provided in

this wall face and wherein the support agent is enclosed in at least one
porous sachet (7), which is inserted between the other wall face (2) and

the matting (3).
Refrigeration and/or freezer appliance according to claim 1, characterised
in that in one container, individual wall sections (1.1 ... 1.5) are allocated

their own support agent sachets (4) and mattings (3), which abut one
another closely in their end-face regions (5.1, 5.2).
Refrigeration and/or freezer appliance according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the wall face (2) directly abutting a support agent

sachet (4) has a continuous bead (6) at least in its edge region.
Refrigeration and/or freezer appliance according to claim 1 or one of the
subsequent claims, characterised in that the vacuum insulation moulded

body is formed as a vessel with a niche (9) drawn into the refrigeration
chamber for a compressor, and in that the pump discharge nozzle (14) is

provided on an outer wall section (1.3) of the niche (9).
Refrigeration and/or freezer appliance according to claim 1 or one of the
subsequent claims, characterised in that the support agent sachet(s) (4)

are pre-formed and pre-compressed so as to match the dimensions of the
cavity. 
Refrigeration and/or freezer appliance according to claim 1 or one of the
subsequent claims, characterised in that the inner walls (2) and/or the

outer walls (1) of the vacuum insulation moulded body consist of plastics
material.
Refrigeration and/or freezer appliance according to claim 6, characterised
in that the plastics material walls (1, 2) are provided with a vacuum-tight

barrier foil.
Refrigeration and/or freezer appliance according to claim 1 or one of the
subsequent claims, characterised in that the support agent is

diatomaceous earth or silicic acid powder.
Method of manufacturing a vacuum insulation moulded body for a
refrigeration and/or freezer appliance according to claim 1 or one of the

subsequent claims, characterised in that the pre-formed and pre-compressed
support agent sachets are inserted into the cavity and in that

afterwards an external pressure is exerted on the opposing wall faces and
simultaneously. or delayed after the start of pressure. the cavity is

evacuated.
