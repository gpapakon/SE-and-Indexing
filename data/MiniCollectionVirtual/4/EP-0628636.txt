<ABSTRACT>
The increase in concentration of sucrose and hexoses or other low 
molecular weight metabolites during the exposure of plant tissue to low 

temperatures is a widespread phenomenon. Sweetened plant material, 
however, becomes unsuitable for processing because of the Maillard 

reaction between reducing sugars and amino acids. The subject invention 
is directed at solving this problem. The subject invention concerns a 

method for reducing plant material's ability for producing sugars which 
can participate in Maillard reactions or precursors of said sugars, 

wherein at least one nucleotide sequence is introduced into the plant 
material, said nucleotide sequence expressing a product capable of 

reducing the amount of UDPG available for conversion to sucrose and 
wherein the reduction in sugar production occurs upon application of an 

external stimulus. The subject invention is also directed at a recombinant 
plant material exhibiting reduced sucrose formation characterised by 

the presence of at least one nucleotide sequence encoding at least a part 
of anti-sense pyrophosphate fructosephosphate phosphotransferase (PFP) 

mRNA, said part being sufficient to cause inhibition of production of 
pyrophosphate fructosephosphate phosphotransferase (PFP) after application 

of an external stimulus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for the reduction of sugar 
accumulation in plant material. In particular the invention is directed 
at the development of transgenic plants which show a modified sugar production 
due to their genetically altered carbohydrate and/or pyrophosphate 
metabolism. The increase in concentration of sucrose and hexoses or other low 
molecular weight metabolites during the exposure of plant tissue to low 
temperatures is a widespread phenomenon. The capacity to produce these 
metabolites following cold-stress assumedly contributes to frost hardiness 
of these plants (ap Rees et al., 1981). In potato tubers, e.g. sucrose and reducing sugars accumulate readily 
during storage at temperatures below 8°C, the exact temperature 
depending on variety and growth conditions. Sweetened potatoes, however, 
become unsuitable for processing because of the Maillard reaction between 
reducing sugars and amino acids, and the subject invention is directed at 
solving this problem. In particular our research was aimed at the investigation 
of fundamental aspects of sweetening and at the development of 
potato varieties which produce tubers with an increased low temperature 
tolerance. This way storability of agricultural produce becomes independent 
of the use of chemical sprout suppressants or disease suppressing 
agents. In many previous studies, a block in glycolysis due to cold lability 
of two enzymes catalyzing the conversion of Fru-6-P to Fru-1,6-P₂ has 
been suggested as the cause of a metabolic switch towards sucrose synthesis 
instead of glycolysis and respiration at reduced temperatures 
(Trevanion and Kruger, 1991) (figure 1). These two enzymes are phosphofructokinase 
(PFK: EC 2.7.1.11.) and pyrophosphate fructose phosphate 
phosphotransferase (PFP:EC 2.7.1.90). It has generally been assumed that 
PFK controls the glycolytic flux as it catalyzes a non-equilibrium reac-PFK  
 
controls the glycolytic flux as it catalyzes a non-equilibrium reaction. 
The function of the second enzyme, pyrophoshate fructosephoshate 
phosphotransferase (PFP: EC 2.7.1.90) has been the subject of a hitherto 
unsolved debate as PFP may participate either in glycolysis or gluconeogenesis 
(Kruger 1990). The occurrence of a block in glycolysis causing a metabolic switch 
towards sucrose synthesis, however, until now has appeared unlikely. 
Firstly because respiration of tubers proceeds unimpeded when stored in 
the cold (Isherwood 1973). Secondly because we have shown that the specific 
activity of
