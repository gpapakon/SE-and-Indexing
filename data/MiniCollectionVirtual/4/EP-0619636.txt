A support member for an elastic sleeve (1) comprising at least one 
rigid tube portion (2) on which an interposed rod (3) of deformable 

material is wound in a helix, at least one end portion of the interposed 
rod extending in the interior of the rigid tube portion. 
A support member according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
interposed rod (3) is made of a material with a low coefficient of 

friction. 
A support member according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in 
that the interposed rod comprises turns which overlap and which have 

edges in projecting relationship which are disposed to engage with an 
edge of an adjacent turn. 
A support member according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised 
in that the rigid tube portion (2) is of an inside diameter (D) that is 

larger than an outside diameter (d) of the elastic sleeve (1) in a 
retracted state. 
An elastic sleeve which is held in an expanded state by a 
removable support member disposed in the interior of the elastic sleeve 

(1), said support member comprising at least one rigid tube portion (2) 
on which an interposed rod (3) of deformable material is wound in a 

helix, at least one end portion (4) of the interposed rod (3) extending in 
the interior of the rigid tube portion (2). 
An elastic sleeve according to claim 5 characterised in that it 
comprises three rigid tube portions (2) disposed in succession in the 

interior of the sleeve, two rigid tube portions (2.1, 2.3) which are 
adjacent to the ends of the elastic sleeve (1) being covered by an 

interposed rod (3.1, 3.3).  

 
An elastic sleeve according to claim 6 characterised in that the 
three tube portions (2) are of identical inside diameters.
