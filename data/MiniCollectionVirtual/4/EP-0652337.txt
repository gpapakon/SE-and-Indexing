<ABSTRACT>
Suspension device for a supporting profile (20) of 
a ceiling. The device consists of a top elongated bearing 

part (4) and a bottom bearing unit (1), consisting of a 
bottom elongated bearing part (2) of flat material, and a 

resilient bracket (3) with diverging legs (5a, 5b), each 
with an opening (8a, 8b). The top bearing part (4) is 

inserted through the openings (8a, 8b) of the bracket legs 
(5a, 5b) and is fixed in the openings (8a, 8b) as the 

result of tilting and the resilience of the bracket legs 
(5a, 5b). The bottom bearing part (2) has a bottom 

suspension end which is suitable for suspending the profile 
(20) therefrom. After coupling of the bottom bearing unit 

(1) to the supporting profile (20), the legs (5a, 5b) of 
the bracket (3) extend essentially at right angles to the 

profile (20). The bottom suspension end of the bottom 
bearing part is formed as a hook (11) with an upward bent 

lip (13) parallel to the flat material of the bottom 
bearing part (2). The hook (11) is suitable to be inserted 

through an opening (25) of a vertical part (21) of the 
supporting profile (20). The bottom bearing part (2) has a 

resilient tongue (14) bent towards the side of the lip 
(13), and a bottom end of which is a free end and ends just 

above the vertical part of the profile (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a suspension device 
according to the preamble of claim 1. A suspension device of the above type is known from 
German Patent Specification DE-B-1215334. With the known 
device the bottom bearing part has horizontal slits through 
which the legs of the resilient bracket are inserted, so 
that the base of the bracket lies against the bottom 
bearing part. Since the legs diverge from the slits, the 
bracket and the bottom bearing part are prevented from 
coming apart, so that they form a unit. By bending the two 
legs of the resilient bracket towards each other, the top 
and bottom bearing parts can be slid vertically relative to 
each other. After releasing the legs of the bracket the top 
bearing part is firmly wedged again against the edges of 
the openings of the bracket legs. The bottom bearing part 
has a bottom suspension end consisting of a slit which goes 
out vertically from the bottom edge of the bottom bearing 
part and ends in an opening with greater, circular cross-section 
than the width of the slit. The width of the slit 
is approximately the same as the thickness of a top 
vertical part of the supporting profile, and the cross-section 
of the opening at the end of the slit is approximately 
equal to the cross-section of a thickened part or 
bead on the top end of said vertical part of the supporting 
profile. The abovementioned document also discloses that, as 
an alternative, the bottom suspension part and the bracket 
can be fixed to each other by means of rivets, screws or 
spot-welding. The supporting profile of the ceiling is generally 
an inverted T-shape, on the flanges of which, for example, 
tiles and light fittings can be placed. The supporting 
profile is suspended from a fixed ceiling by means of a 
number of suspension devices. In this case each suspension  
 
device and the supporting profile are connected to each 
other through the bottom suspension end of each suspension 
device being slid from the end of the supporting profile 
over the top thereof with the thickened part or bead. 
Therefore, after the supporting profile has been suspended, 
the fitting of additional suspension devices, or removal 
thereof if they are too much in the way, is very time-consuming. Since the bottom bearing part is relatively broad, 
both in the vicinity of the bracket and in the vicinity of 
the slit and the opening of the bottom suspension end 
thereof, this makes it difficult to fit, for example, tiles 
and light fittings on the supporting profiles of the 
ceiling
