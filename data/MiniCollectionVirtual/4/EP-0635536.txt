<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to multilayer composite systems built up from polyesters P1 and poly(meth)acrylates P2, where the poly(meth)acrylate P2 is applied, as top layer, to the polyester P1 and contains from 0.1 to 10 % by weight, based on P2, of conventional UV absorbers, and to mouldings formed therefrom.

<CLAIMS>
Multilayered composite systems synthesised from
polyester P1 comprising at least 70 wt.% of units

according to formula I


wherein

R
is a group -(CH
2
)
m
- or a group


and wherein
m
is an integer of 2 to 6

and poly(meth)acrylate P2, synthesised from 20-100 wt.%
of halogen-free monomers according to formula II



wherein

R
1
is hydrogen or methyl
R
2
is a spacer group having 1 to 6 members,
preferably selected from the group of

alkylidenes having 1 to 6 carbon atoms in the
chain and the group -(CH
2
)p-O-, wherein q is
zero or 1 and p is an integer of 2 - 6,
R

aminoalkyl or -dialkyl group having 1 to 6

carbon atoms and z is zero, 1 or 2,

characterised in that

poly(meth)acrylate P2 is applied as a top layer onto
polyester P1, and in that poly(meth)acrylate P2

comprises 0.1 to 10 wt.%, based on P2, of conventional
ultraviolet absorbers, cinnamic acid and derivatives 

thereof being excluded.
