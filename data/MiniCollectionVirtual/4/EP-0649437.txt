<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of complexes of iodine with chitosan or derivatives thereof, and the iodinated compounds thus obtainable. Said compounds take form of powders, which may contain over 60 % of iodine in its elementary form. In a dry state the iodine bound to the chitosan or derivatives thereof does not sublimate. If the percentage content of iodine does not exceed 50 % (by weight), said powders can be dissolved in aqueous solvents of an acid type, such as, for example, diluted acetic acid or glutamic acid. Said solutions are compatible with addition of surfactants, preferably of a non-ionic type, which improve the solubility of the chitosan-iodine complex. Solutions with identical characteristics can, alternatively, be prepared by solubilizing, heating if necessary the iodine in a suitable surfactant, preferably non-ionic, and adding this solution under rapid stirring to the chitosan derivatives thereof, dissolved in water, optionally in the presence of acids or salts. Alternatively, the chitosan or derivatives thereof in a dry state can be added to the solution of iodine in surfactant which rapidly absorbs onto the solid, forming the chitosan-iodine complexes. This material suspended in water or in acid solutions, preferably acetic acid or glutamic acid, solubilizes rapidly. The complexes of iodine with chitosan or derivatives thereof, in the form of aspersable powders, solutions or ointments, thanks to their disinfectant and cicatrizing properties, can be used in the field of surgery post-operative treatment and more generally speaking as products for topical use for medication of wounds and disinfectation of the skin. Another area of interest in which the complexes can be used as an active principle is the field of cosmetics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention has as its subject a process
for the preparation, in the absence of solvents, of
charge-transfer complexes of iodine with chitosan or
deacetylated, acylated with mono- or polycarboxylic
acids, aldyminated, N or O-carboxymethylated or
sulphatated derivatives thereof, the iodinated
complexes thus obtainable and the therapeutical
compounds containing them as an active principle.The iodinated complexes according to the present
invention are charge-transfer complexes of iodine
with chitosan and derivatives thereof, containing
iodine in a proportion expressed by the general
formula X(I2)n, in which X is the monomeric unit of
a polymer chosen from the group comprising chitosan,
N-carboxybutylchitosan, N-acylchitosans, N-carboxymethylchitosan,
N-O-carboxymethylchitosan, N-O-chitosan
sulphate and n is a number variable from
0.01 to 1.5.According to a preferred embodiment, X is chosen
from the group comprising the monomeric units given
in the following Table 1.

germicidal activity, for this reason it is used in
alcoholic solutions as a disinfectant for topical use.The limits to said use are the low stability over
a period of time of the iodine solutions, the notable
aggressiveness of this halogen on the tissues when
applied as a solution, and the persistent stains it
leaves on the skin.More recently, water-soluble forms of iodine with
polyvinylpyrrolidone have been commercialized, which
only partially mitigate these undesirable negative
effects.There is therefore great interest in the
development of "slow release" iodine-based forms which
allow application of large quantities of active
principle, which are then released gradually but 
continually, so as to guarantee effective defence
from infection by microorganisms over a long period,
without damaging the tissues and reducing the number
of medications required.Of particularly great advantage is the possibility
of coupling the iodine with compounds capable of
stimulating tissue regeneration, so as to aid the
healing process as a whole.From this point of view, chitosan and in general
the other derivatives of this polysaccharide, only
partially indicated in Table 1, are of particular
interest according to the present invention, due to
