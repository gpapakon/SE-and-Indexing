<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming transistors having sublithographic features, for 
example, gates, is disclosed. A patterned hardmask (formed, for example from 

PETEOS) is created overlying oxide and polysilicon layers. The dimensions of the 
hardmask are reduced by isotropic etching. The reduced-dimension hardmask is 

used with an anisotropic etching process to define a reduced-dimension feature such 
as a gate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of semiconductor integrated circuit
formation.As the use of integrated circuits becomes more pervasive, the
geometries of individual circuits continue to shrink. Generally speaking, the
lithographic process, which involves patterning a photoresist material and
subsequently anisotropically etching underlying layers, determines the size of the
smallest features which can be created in an integrated circuit. However, designers
have continually sought techniques which will produce features or openings which
have dimensions that are less than what may be achieved by conventional
lithography.One of the most fundamental features of a MOSFET (metal oxide
semiconductor field effect transistor) is the gate. Generally speaking, circuits with
smaller gates operate more quickly, and contain more transistors.The prior art documents DE-A-3 915 650 and EP-A-0 394 597 disclose different techniques to pattern a layer in order to form the gate of a transistor, wherein the size of a mask is reduced by isotropic etching to under the limit of resolution of the exposure apparatus.The present invention addresses the above-mentioned concerns, and is defined by the appended claim.FIGS. 1-4 are cross-sectional views of an illustrative embodiment of the
present invention.In the following description it will be referred to thicknesses expressed in Angströms (Å). One Angström equals 0.1 nm.In FIG. 1 reference numeral 11 denotes a substrate of
silicon, doped silicon, epitaxial silicon, or a layer of epitaxial silicon
upon doped silicon, etc. In general, the term substrate refers to a material or body
upon which a variety of layers may be formed. Reference numeral 13 denotes a
dielectric layer, typically silicon dioxide or, possibly, silicon oxynitride. Typically,
layer 13 is formed upon substrate 11 (after the field oxide has been formed) by
thermal oxidation. The thickness of layer 13 may be typically between 50Å and
500Å.  Layer 15 is a layer of conductive polysilicon (which may or
may not be doped at this juncture). The thickness of layer 15 is
typically between 500Å and 5000Å. Layer 15 may be typically formed by chemical
vapor deposition.Layer 17 is a layer of
tungsten silicide. The thickness of layer 17 is between 500Å and 5000Å.
Layer 17 may be formed by a variety of means including sputtering or chemical
vapor deposition.Layer 19 is a dielectric used as a hardmask
in a hardmask etching process. Layer 19 is formed from plasma-enhanced
TEOS. If layers 13, 15 and 17 have thicknesses within the
