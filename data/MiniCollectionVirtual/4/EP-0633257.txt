<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new class of perfluorodioxoles, 
some processes for their preparation and the 
homopolymers and copolymers obtained from such perfluorodioxoles. 
It relates also to new thermoprocessable copolymers of 
tetrafluoroethylene containing fluorodioxoles, particularly 
suitable for coating electric cables by melt extrusion. FEP copolymers (tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropene 
copolymers) are known, having a melting temperature of about 
260-265°C and endowed with relatively good mechanical properties 
up to a temperature of 200°C, as described for instance 
in US Patent 2,946,763. It is known that, for the processing 
of thermoprocessable polymers by extrusion, a low melt 
viscosity is required, i.e. a high melt flow index. A 
reduction of viscosity leads to a decay of the mechanical 
properties. To attenuate this effect, copolymers having a 
higher percentage of hexafluoropropene are prepared. However, 
the use of a higher percentage of this comonomer implies a 
sharp reduction of the melting point and therefore a lower 
rating temperature. US Patent 4,029,868 illustrates another kind of FEP  
 
copolymers containing, besides tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropene, 
from 0.5 to 3% by weight of a third monomer 
consisting of perfluoropropylvinylether or perfluoroethylvinylether. 
These terpolymers have a viscosity lower than the 
FEP copolymers containing only tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropene. Nevertheless, mechanical properties at high temperature 
(200°C) remain still acceptable. According to the same patent 
above, perfluoromethylvinylether is not suitable as third 
monomer (see, in particular col. 3, lines 38-39 and comparative 
example A). US Patent 4,587,316 suggests the use, as third monomer, 
of perfluoroalkylvinylethers wherein the perfluoroalkyl group 
contains an even higher number of carbon atoms: from 4 to 10. Typically a FEP terpolymer containing about 6% by mols of 
hexafluoropropene and about 0.4% by moles of perfluoropropylvinylether 
and having a melt index of about 18-20 shows the 
following properties: 
melting temperature: about 260°C; stress at break at 200°C: about 4 MPa; yield stress at 200°C: about 3 MPa. The methods for determining these properties will be 
described hereinafter. Generally, superior mechanical properties are obtained  
 
with TFE/perfluoroalkylvinylether copolymers, in particular 
with perfluoropropylvinylether, as described in US patent 
3,635,926, independently from the melt viscosity. The performances of this class
