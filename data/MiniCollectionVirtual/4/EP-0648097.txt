<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for cleaning medical instruments which have a channel-like cavity. In order to ensure that such instruments can be reliably cleaned with a liquid, even if the cavity is not readily accessible, the invention proposes that the instruments are dipped into the cleaning liquid so that one end of the cavity is in the liquid and the other end of the cavity is connected to a suction line. Also proposed is a device for carrying out this method.

A method of cleaning medical tubular-shafted instruments, in which one end of the 
tubular-shafted instruments is immersed in a cleaning fluid and cleaning fluid is drawn 

off at the other end, characterised in that the handle of the tubular-shafted instruments 
and a large part of the shaft joined thereto are immersed in the cleaning fluid, while the 

free end of the tubular-shafted instruments projects from the fluid, and in that a suction 
hose is sealingly pushed onto the free end of the tubular-shafted instrument. 
A method in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that a plurality of tubular-shafted 
instruments are each connected at the same time to a common suction line via a 

respective suction hose, and each connection between a tubular-shafted instrument and 
the suction line is opened or closed individually. 
A method in accordance with either of Claims 1 or 2, characterised in that gas bubbles 
are introduced into the cleaning bath, these gas bubbles rising in the cleaning fluid in the 

region of the suction openings of the tubular-shafted instrument and thereby being drawn 
into the tubular-shafted instrument. 
A method in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that with tubular-shafted 
instruments having parts movable in relation to one another, these parts are 

moved relative to one another during the cleaning procedure. 
A device for cleaning medical tubular-shafted instruments (3), having a container (2; 28) 
for a cleaning fluid in which the tubular-shafted instruments (3) are immersed, 

characterised in that a holding device (11) is provided on which the tubular-shafted 
instruments (3) can be positioned in such a manner that their handle and a large part of 

the shaft joined thereto are immersed in the cleaning fluid, in that a suction chamber (20) 
is arranged at the upper part (18) of the holding device (11) and bears a number of 

sealing devices (10; 22) arranged side by side, and in that a hose (4; 23) sealingly 
attachable to the free end of the shaft is joined to each sealing device (10; 22) as a 

connection to the tubular-shafted instruments (3).  
 
A device in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that the sealing device (22) is a 
manually operable closing valve. 
A device in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that the sealing device (10) is a 
stopper which is secured to the device and to which the free end of the hose (4) is 

sealingly attachable. 
A device in accordance with any one of Claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the holding 
device (11) is composed of at least two parts (12, 18) movable relative to one another 

between an operative position with great over-all height and a rest position with low 
over-all height. 
A device in accordance with Claim 8, characterised in that in the operative position, the 
two parts (12, 18) can be fastened relative to one another. 
A device in accordance with Claim 8 or 9, characterised in that the upper part (18) is 
pivotable relative to the lower part (12) of the holding device (11). 
A device in accordance with any one of Claims 5 to 10, characterised in that a container 
(28) which can be filled with the cleaning fluid is provided, this
 container (28) being 
sealable by means of a cover (30) and being dimensioned such that in the rest position at 

least, it receives the entire holding device (11). 
A device in accordance with Claim 11, characterised in that a removable insert (29) is 
arranged in the container (28) and is located above the holding device (11) therein, the 

connecting hoses (23) being able to be placed in this insert (29). 
A device in accordance with any one of Claims 5 to 12, characterised in that at least one 
inlet (31) for a gas is provided in the container and is located below the tubular-shafted 

instruments (3) therein which are immersed in the cleaning fluid, the gas being able to 
enter into the cleaning fluid below the tubular-shafted instruments (3) through this inlet 

(31). 
A device in accordance with any one of Claims 5 to 13, characterised in that a drive (32) 
acting upon the tubular-shafted instruments (3) is provided and moves in relation to one 

another those parts of the tubular-shafted instruments (3) movable in relation to one 
another.
