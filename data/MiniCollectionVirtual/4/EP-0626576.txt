<ABSTRACT>
A multifunctional method for optical determination of numerous quality-determining parameters of textile surfaces with the aid of an identical arrangement of an imaging sensor and an especially designed illumination device is described. The illumination device consists of a multiplicity of point-like light elements, especially semiconductor light-emitting diodes, which are fixed on a spatially curved arrangement which is divided into regions, in such a way that the textile surface is illuminated from different directions and/or in different regions. For the quality characteristic to be measured in each case, the corresponding optimum lighting configuration is electronically determined and this characteristic is determined from the stored images using image-processing methods which are likewise matched.
