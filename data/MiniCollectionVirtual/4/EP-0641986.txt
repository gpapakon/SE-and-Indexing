<ABSTRACT>
A pair of header plates 9 securely brazed with a pair of 
side plates 5 without causing any buckling to tubes 2 and any 

deformation to the header plates 5. First, each tube 2 is press-fitted 
into a corresponding press-fitting hole 12 in the header 

plates 5, and at the same time, the end parts of a pair of side 
plates 9 make contact with the pair of header plates 5. Second, 

flaring pins are press fitted into the end parts of the tubes in 
such a way that the end parts of the tubes 2 disposed near either 

side of a core assembly are flared to an angle of approximately 
180° and the end parts of the tubes 2 disposed in the central 

part of the core assembly are flared to an angle within a range 
from approximately 60° to approximately 80°. Third, cores 4, 

etc. are hung from either of the upper header plates 5, whichever 
is disposed at the upper side, and then this assembly is brazed. 

At this time, large widening parts with an angle of approximately 
180° can prevent the upper header plate 9 from sliding downwards. 

In this arrangement, the contacting state of the header plates 
9 with the side plates can be maintained, whereby secure brazing 

can be performed. Although the flared angle is large for the 
tubes disposed near either side of the core assembly and large 

loads are applied thereto, as the large loads are received by the 

side plates 9, the tubes 2 disposed near either side will not be 
buckled. On the other hand, as the flare angle is small for the 

tubes 2 disposed in the central part of the core assembly and 
only small loads are applied thereto, the tubes disposed in the 

central part of the core assembly will not be buckled or the 
header plates 9 will not be deformed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for producing a heat exchanger 
according to the preamble of claim 1, as well as to a heat 
exchanger according to the preamble of claim 15. US-A-4 700 469, which is the closest prior art document, discloses such a heat exchanger and a method for 
producing the same, wherein considerably large loads had to be 
applied to all the tubes and the header placed around the 
respective tubes when the end parts of the tubes were flared to 
an angle of approximately 180°. DE-A-2 320 866 discloses a heat exchanger wherein the ends of 
tubes are flared by a special tool.  
 As illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6, it is known to stack 
cores 103 with a plurality of tubes 101 in order to form engine 
cooling water passages. Furthermore, it is known to assemble a 
plurality of corrugated fins 102 and connect a pair of header 
plates 104 to both ends of tubes 101, and also to connect header 
plates 104 using side plates 105. Cores 103 are hung from an 
upper header plate 104 in a downward direction. Upper header 
plate 104 is supported by carbon jigs 106. An assembly including 
these structure is integrally brazed within a furnace. Each tube 
101 is lightly press fitted into each press-fitting hole 107 
within the pair of header plates 104. Cores 103 are held between 
side plates 105 at both sides of the heat exchanger (in some 
cases, cores 103 are held between side plates 105 and bundled 
with wires, etc.). When the assembly is brazed in this state, the brazing 
material clad on the surface of each tube 101 melts and flows, 
whereby the width in the direction of the stack of corrugated 
fins 102 and tubes 101 (lateral direction) is reduced, and at the  
 
same time, the reaction force of the corrugated fins 102, side 
plates 105, etc. is decreased in the high temperature condition 
associated with brazing. As a result, as illustrated in FIG. 7, 
a gap tl is formed between the back of end side 105a of side 
plate 105 and the back of inner wall 108a of U-shape groove 108 
formed on the distal end part of header plate 104. Furthermore, when the brazing material clad on the 
surface of each tube 101 melts and flows, the diameter of each 
tube 101 is reduced, and at the same time, due to the exposure 
to high temperatures, the press-fitting force of each tube 101 
press fits into each press-fitting hole 107 in the header plate 
104 is decreased, whereby cores 103 hung from the upper header 
plate 104 may slide down by due to their own weight. If core 103 
slides down from upper header plate
