Extension fitting (10, 76, 82) of a strapping belt with a belt 
anchor (36, 60, 78) mounted thereon which loosably engages 

with the holding profile of an opposite part, with an eyelet 
(56, 72) for the strapping belt on the belt anchor (36, 60, 

78), and with an eyelet (16) for an extension belt on the 
extension fitting (10, 76, 82) opposite to the eyelet (56, 

72) for the strapping belt, characterized in that the extension 
fitting (10, 76, 82) comprises a plate (12) with two claws 

(24) fixed laterally thereon and directed towards one another 
which form the holding pofile, that the belt anchor (36, 60, 

78) comprises a foot (38) with at least one anchor mushroom 
(40, 42; 64; 80) extending therefrom having a head which fits 

between the claws (24), and that the eyelet (16) for the extension 
belt is disposed to the side of the plate turned away 

from the claws (24) in such a manner that it will be opposite 
to the eyelet (46, 72) for the strapping belt when the belt 

anchor (36, 60, 78) engages with the claws (24). 
Extension fitting (10, 76, 82) according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the plate (12) is substantially ractangular. 
Extension fitting (10, 76, 82) according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the claws (24) essentially comprise 

a C-profile.  
 
Extension fitting (10, 76, 82) according to claim 3, characterized 

in that the foot (38) of the belt anchor (36, 60, 
78) fits between the claws (24), and that the head of the 

anchor mushroom (40, 42; 64; 80) fits into the opening of 
the C-profile of the claws (24). 
Extension fitting according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the claws (24) are provided with at 

least one recess (30, 32, 52, 54, 56) and/or widening (50) 
for introducing the anchor mushroom (40, 42; 64; 80). 
Extension fitting according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the belt anchor (60) has a single mushroom 

(64), and that the claws (24) have widenings (50) arranged 
in the longitudinal direction of the profile on both sides. 
Extension fitting according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the belt anchor has two mushrooms (40, 

42), and that the claws (24) are provided with two recesses 
(52, 54) spaced apart in the longitudinal direction of the 

profile for introducing the two anchor mushrooms (40, 42). 
Extension fitting according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the belt anchor (78) has three mushrooms 

(80), and that the claws (24) are provided with three recesses 
(52, 54, 56) spaced apart in the longitudinal direction of 

the profile for introducing the three anchor mushrooms (80). 
Extension fitting according one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the recesses (30, 32, 52, 54, 56) each comprise 

a pair of circular segments lying opposite one another, 
the periphery of each pair of which lying on a common circle.
