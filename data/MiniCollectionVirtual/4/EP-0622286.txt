<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sound-damping supporting element for covering elements (10), in particular for forming floors in railway vehicles for passenger transport. The supporting element has a rigid profile (6) which is attached to the supporting or covering element (1, 10) and is supported elastically in relation to the respective other element with the intermediate connection of a damping element. In order to improve the damping behaviour of the supporting element over the frequency range from 0 to approximately 200 Hertz, an elastic profile strip (2) is attached to the supporting or covering element (1, 10) to which supporting or covering element (1, 10) a rigid hollow profile (5) which is open with respect to the other element (covering or supporting element) is attached and a second rigid profile (6) which engages with a formed-on web (7) in the open hollow profile (5) and is elastically connected, with spacing, to the rigid hollow profile (5) by means of an elastic damping material (8) is attached to the covering or supporting element (1, 10), the damping material (8) having physical properties such that it is suitable for sufficiently damping relatively high frequencies up to approximately 200 Hertz.

Sound-insulating supporting element for covering members, in 
particular for forming floors in railway vehicles for conveying 

passengers, consisting of a rigid profile which is fixed to the 
support member or to the covering member and is braced elastically 

against the other member with an interposed insulating element, 
characterised in that an elastic profile strip (2) is fixed to the 

support member or covering member (1 or 10), which profile strip 
exhibits a recess (3) in which a rigid hollow profile (5) open to 

the other member (covering member 10 or support member 1) is fixed 
by a clamp fit in that projections (4) of the rigid hollow profile 

(5) engage in the recess (3) of the elastic profile strip (2), in 
that a second rigid profile (6) is fixed to the covering member or 

support member (10 or 1), which rigid profile exhibits a web (7) 
which engages in the open hollow profile (5) and is connected 

elastically by means of an elastic insulating material (8) at a 
distance to the rigid hollow profile (5), the insulating material 

(8) exhibiting physical properties such that it is suitable for 
adequately insulating higher frequencies. 
Sound-insulating supporting element for covering members 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the elastic insulating 

material (8) exhibits physical properties such that it is suitable 
for adequately insulating higher frequencies from approximately 20 

to approximately 200 Hertz. 
Sound-insulating supporting element for covering members 
according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the elastic profile 

strip (2) exhibits physical properties such that it is suitable for 
adequately insulating low frequencies from 0 to approximately 20 

Hertz. 
Sound-insulating supporting element for covering members 
according to at least one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 

the insulating material (8) is a synthetic foam, in particular a 
polyurethane foam (PUR).  

 
Sound-insulating supporting element for covering members 
according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that a 

continuous chord (6a) which is disposed parallel to the external 
chord (6b) of the profile (6) is formed on the free end of the web 

(7) of the second profile (6). 
Sound-insulating supporting element for covering members 
according to at least one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 

the external chord (6b) extends at least to the side webs (5a, 5b) 
of the hollow profile (5). 
Sound-insulating supporting element for covering members 
according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 

the insulating material (8) is extended beyond the cavity of the 
hollow profile (5) and bears on the undersides of the external chord 

(6b) enclosing the web (5a, 5b). 
Sound-insulating supporting element for covering members 
according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that 

the elastic profile strip (2) is fixed to the support member or 
covering member (1 or 10) by means of a clamp fit. 
Sound-insulating supporting element for covering members 
according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that a 

compensating insert (9) made of an elastic material (e.g. rubber) is 
disposed between the rigid profile (6) and the covering member or 

support member (10 or 1). 
Sound-insulating supporting element for covering members 
according to at least one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that at 

its free ends the hollow profile (5) exhibits edges (11a, 11b) which 
are bent over in the direction of its longitudinal median plane and 

are disposed parallel with the external chord (6b).
