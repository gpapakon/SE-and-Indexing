<ABSTRACT>
A low velocity aortic cannula (20) having a proximal end (24), a distal end (26), and a lumen 

(28) therebetween for conducting blood, the 
distal end being adapted for insertion into the aorta during 

heart surgery to provide blood to the aorta. There is a diffuser 
at least partially blocking the distal end of the cannula, and 

a plurality of outlet openings (34) in the side of the distal end of 
the cannula. In one embodiment the distal end of the cannula is 

closed with a cap (30), and the diffuser is a rounded cone extending 
generally upstream in the lumen. The outlet openings are located 

in the sidewall (22) of the cannula. In a second embodiment of the 
invention, the diffuser has a helical configuration, and 

partially blocks the distal opening of the cannula. Additional 
openings are provided in the sidewall to permit flow. According 

to the method of this invention, an opening is formed in the 
aorta, the distal end of one of the embodiments of the cannula is 

inserted into the opening, and blood flow through the cannula is 
established.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a low velocity aortic cannula for
use during hear surgery, and a method of delivering blood to the
aorta using a low velocity aortic cannula.Aortic cannulas are used to return blood to the aorta while
the heart is by-passed during heart surgery. These cannulas are
purposely made with small diameters (typically six to eight
millimeters, but even smaller for pediatric applications) to
minimize the disruption to the aorta, which in many heart surgery
patients have advanced complex atherosclerotic lesions with
adherent blood thrombi. The flow velocities through these small
diameter cannula must be very high in order to maintain a
satisfactory blood flow rate of about five to seven liters per
minute. In at least some styles of conventional aortic cannula
now in use, this high velocity resulted in "jet" flow emanating
from the distal end of the cannula, which acted as a nozzle. It
is believed that the force of this narrow jet stream may dislodge
atheromatous material from the walls of the aorta, causing
embolisms. As surgical equipment and techniques improve, making
heart surgery available to older and more seriously ill patients,
thrombo-athercembolisms affect an increasing number of patients
due to the increasing extent of atherosclerosis with age.The size of aortic cannula is constrained by the constricted
size of the aorta of the typical heart surgery patient.
Moreover, the ability to diffuse flow is restricted by the
fragility of the blood, which is easily damaged by the shear
stresses associated with turbulence. US-A-4 643 712 discloses an aortic cannula for insertion into
the aorta during heart surgery to provide blood to the aorta.
The cannula comprises a head shaped as an oblate cone that
flares out from the front end toward the base, the front head
end being an ellipse in cross-section, while the head base is
essentially a circle carrying a blood flow divider, the flow
of blood passing along a tube provided with a slidable sleeve
and having at least two through holes made in its walls
immediately at the head base. The cannula construction is
intended to rule out the danger of inflicting traumatic
lesion upon the aortic tissues and the loss of blood
resulting from insertion of the head of the cannula into the
aorta, reduce the turbulence or the blood flow supplied, and
preclude the risk of air bubbles penetrating into the
patient's blood.The aortic cannulas of the present invention
are characterized by the features of the claims, and
are adapted to
provide high volume flow
