<ABSTRACT>
Dyestuffs represented by the below-described formula 
(1), that is, dyestuffs formed of a chromophoric 

nucleus and a bisphenol introduced therein have excellent 
solubility in solvents and binder resins, and 

can provide color filters having excellent transmittance 
characteristics and durability. 


wherein Dye represents a chromophoric nucleus, X 
represents a direct bond or a divalent connecting 

group, R¹ to R⁸ independently represent a hydrogen 
atom, a halogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted 

alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl 
group or a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxyl group, 

R⁹ and R¹⁰ independently represent a hydrogen atom or a 
substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, and n stands 

for an integer of 1 to 10, with the proviso that the 
total carbon number of R⁹ and R¹⁰ is at least 3.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dyestuffs, which play
an important role in color filters for display devices
such as liquid crystal television sets and also in
color separation filters for image pickup tubes, color
copiers, video printers and the like.Conventionally known dyestuffs for filters include,
as blue dyestuffs, anthraquinone dyestuffs (Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Nos. 136604/1987 and
197459/1987) and triphenylmethane dyestuffs ("1990s Development
and Market Trend of Special Functional
Dyestuffs", 47-48, CMC Co., Ltd.); as red dyestuffs,
anthraquinone dyestuffs (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
74960/1987), azo dyestuffs ("1990s Development and
Market Trend of Special Functional Dyestuffs", 47, CMC
Co., Ltd.) and perinone dyestuffs (Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 136606/1987); as green dyestuffs, anthraquinone
dyestuffs (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 
246258/1986), triphenylmethane dyestuffs ("1990s Development
and Market Trend of Special Functional
Dyestuffs", 47-48, CMC Co., Ltd.), phthalocyanine
dyestuffs (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 24102/1985,
140902/1986, 254903/1986, 254904/1986, 6904/1989,
88505/1989, and 233401/1989), perinone dyestuffs (Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 136606/1987), and naphthoquinone
dyestuffs (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
110290/1985); and as yellow dyestuffs, azo and vat-dye
pigments ("1990s Development and Market Trend of Special
Functional Dyestuffs", 48, CMC Co., Ltd.) and
water-soluble azo dyes (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos.
204010/1984 and 204011/1984).As to the blue dyestuffs, the anthraquinone
compounds do not permit sufficient light transmission
around 440 nm but have high transmittance at wavelengths
of 500 nm and longer, so that they have a broad
transmittance curve. In the case of the triphenylmethane
dyestuffs, their molecules are in an ionized
form so that they are suited for coloring filters
making use of gelatin or casein as a substrate and were
hence used in gelatin-type filters. Those filters
themselves however had low light fastness and heat
resistance. Turning next to the red dyestuffs, the
anthraquinone compounds and perinone compounds are accompanied 
by the drawback that they have low transmittance
and poor color visibility, although their
durability is good. The azo compounds are water-soluble
and are thus suited for coloring filters making
use of gelatin or casein as a substrate. The azo compounds
were therefore employed in gelatin-type filters.
Due to poor heat and moisture resistance of the filters
themselves, their applications were limited.
