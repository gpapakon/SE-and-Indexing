<ABSTRACT>
A device for automatically milking animals 
comprises a milking parlour (1), animal identifying means 

(23) fastened to an animal and cooperating with sensor means 
connected to a computer in order to identify the animal and 

to supply concentrate to the animal in the milking parlour 
(1). The device is further provided with a milking unit (29) 

comprising a support (54) capable of carrying teat cups (52), 
said teat cups (52) being together movable in a horizontal 

plane as well as in the up- and downward direction relative 
to the animal. The teat cups (52) are also individually 

movable in a substantially horizontal plane and adjustably 
connected to the support (54), the adjustability being 

performed under computer control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
automatically milking animals, such as cows, comprising a
milking parlour, animal identifying means fastened to an
animal and cooperating with sensor means connected to a
computer in order to identify the animal and cooperating with
computer controlled fodder supply means to supply concentrate
to the animal in the milking parlour, the device further
being provided with a milking unit comprising a central
support with teat cups, said teat cups being together movable
in a horizontal plane as well as in the up- and downward
direction relative to the milking parlour, the teat cups
being also individually movable in a substantially horizontal
plane and being therefor adjustably connected to the central
support, the device further being provided with a cleaning and/or
drying unit couplable to the udder of the animal.Such a device is known from EP-A-0 091 892. In such
a device an animal is retained in the milking parlour,
whereafter a milking robot carrying teat cups and sensor
means can be brought underneath the animal. By means of the
sensor means the position of the teats is determined in order
to connect the teat cups to the teats. It is the object of
the invention to improve the connecting of the teat cups to
the animal.To that effect, according to the invention
the device as described in the opening paragraph is
characterized by the features of the characterizing part of
claim 1.A favourable embodiment may be obtained when the
central support is movable in a horizontal plane around two 
vertically directed pins, e.g., by means of computer-controlled
electric motors. Further, the central support may
be movable in the up- and downward direction by means of a
spindle driven e.g. by a computer-controlled electric motor.In a specific arrangement the central support may
be movable from a non-operative position to under the udder
of an animal to be milked. On the opposite side of the
milking parlour where the central support is movably mounted
a cleaning and/or drying unit is movably mounted.In an arrangement where the support and the
cleaning and/or drying unit are mounted at opposite sides of
the milking parlour, a preferred embodiment may be obtained
when the milking parlour is provided with an entrance and an
exit door at the short sides of the milking parlour, said
doors being operable by control members, such as hydraulic or
pneumatic cylinders, under computer control.For a better understanding of the invention an
embodiment of the device for milking animals

<CLAIMS>
A device for automatically milking animals, such as
cows, comprising a milking parlour (1), animal identifying

means (23) fastened to an animal and cooperating with sensor
means connected to a computer in order to identify the animal

and cooperating with computer controlled fodder supply means
to supply concentrate to the animal in the milking parlour

(1), the device further being provided with a milking unit
(29) comprising a central support (54) with teat cups (52),

said teat cups (52) being together movable in a horizontal
plane as well as in the up- and downward direction relative

to the milking parlour (1), the teat cups (52) being also
individually movable in a substantially horizontal plane and

being therefor adjustably connected to the central support
(54), the device further being provided with a cleaning

and/or drying unit (28) couplable to the udder of the animal,
characterized in that the adjustability is performed under

computer control on the basis of data for each animal being
present in the computer and in that the teat cups (52) are

connected to the central support (54) by means of arms having
two hingeable connections, while the cleaning and/or drying

unit (28) can spray a fluid against the teats.
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
the central support (54) is movable in a horizontal plane

around two vertically directed pins (30, 31).
A device as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that
the central support (54) is movable around the pins (30, 31)

by means of computer controlled electric motors (39, 47).
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the central support (54) is

movable in the up- and downward direction by means of a
spindle (49) driven by a computer controlled electric motor

(38). 
A device as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the central support (54) is

movable from a non-operative position to under the udder of
an animal to be milked.
A device as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that
a cleaning and/or drying unit (28) is movable from a non-operative

position to under the udder of an animal to be
milked.
A device as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that
the milking parlour (1) is provided with an entrance and an

exit door (3, 4) at the short sides of the milking parlour,
said doors (3, 4) being operable by control members, such as

hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders, under computer control.
