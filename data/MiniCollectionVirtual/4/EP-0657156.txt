<ABSTRACT>
A holding device for a bed, in particular a hospital bed, 
comprises mounting portion (72) for fixedly mounting said 

holding device (10) to a bed frame part (32, 36, 38), an 
abutment portion (76) adjacent to said mounting 

portion (72) for laterally fixing said mattress (70) with 
respect to said bed frame part (38), a supporting 

portion (88) adjacent to the mounting portion (72) for

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a holding device for a 
bed, in particular a hospital bed, comprising a bed frame 
with a plurality of frame parts movable relative to each 
other and carrying a mattress, each of said bed frame 
parts supporting a mattress supporting panel part, said 
panel parts defining a supporting face for said mattress. In general, hospital beds comprise a height and 
inclination adjustable support frame which is supported by 
a lower support structure provided with ground wheels for 
easily moving the hospital bed on the floor. The support 
frame supports a plurality of bed frame parts which are 
articulated to the support frame for adjusting the angular 
position of the bed frame parts with respect to the 
support frame. Each of the bed frame parts supports a 
mattress supporting panel part which, in common, define a 
supporting face for a mattress disposed on the panel 
parts. Such known hospital beds are designed such as to ensure 
that a person lying on the bed can easily be removed from 
the bed without the necessity for lifting the person above 
frame parts extending beyond an upper face of the 
mattress. The same holds true for the case where a patient 
is to be placed on the bed. Therefore, the mattress of 
such hospital beds is simply laid on the supporting panel 
parts and the bed frame parts, leading to the problem that 
particularly in the case of lateral movements, when 
placing a patient on the bed or removing a patient from 
the bed, the mattress might be torn or pushed away from 
the panel parts in a lateral direction.  Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to 
provide a holding device for a bed which eliminates the 
risk of a movement of the mattress with respect to the bed 
frame parts and which does not obstruct free access to the 
bed from a lateral direction. It is a further object of the invention to provide a 
holding device for a bed capable of holding a plurality of 
different elements with respect to the bed frame parts. According to the invention these objects are solved by a 
holding device comprising a mounting portion for fixedly 
mounting said holding device to one of said bed frame 
parts, an abutment portion adjacent to said mounting 
portion at a side of said mounting portion remote from one 
of said panel parts, said one panel part being supported 
by said one bed frame part, for laterally fixing said 
mattress with respect to said bed frame part, a supporting 
portion adjacent to the mounting portion at a side of said 
mounting

Holding device for a bed, in particular a hospital 
bed, comprising a bed frame structure with a 

plurality of frame parts (32, 36, 38) movable relative 
to each other and carrying a mattress (70), each 

of said bed frame parts (32, 36, 38) supporting a 
mattress supporting panel part (62, 66, 68), said 

panel part (62, 66, 68) defining a supporting 
face (78) for said mattress (70), said holding 

device (10) comprising:
