<ABSTRACT>
A closed loop neural network based autotuner (66) develops optimized proportional, integral and/or derivative parameters (18) based on the outputs (u, y, r, e...) of other elements in the loop. Adjustments are initiated by making a step change in the setpoint which may be done by a user or automatically. A Smith predictor (31) may also be employed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of tuners for
controllers and has particular application to closed
loop autotuners for adaptive proportional integral and
proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers.In innumerable situations, it is important to
have the output of some "process" (e.g., the
temperature in a room, the quality of a product being
manufactured in a chemical plant, the altitude of an
aircraft) conform to a specified desired value called
a setpoint or reference value. This is effected by
using a device called a "controller" that takes as
input, typically, the error between the current
process output (current room temperature, for example)
and the desired process output or "setpoint" (as
specified by the thermostat setting) and produces as
output a control signal (a signal to the furnace that
regulates fuel flow). The entire setup consisting of
the controller, the process and the connections that
establish the information flow, is referred to as a
"control loop" and a process that is being controlled
in this fashion is said to be under closed-loop
control. In contrast, a process is in "open-loop"
when it is given a predetermined input signal and the
process output is observed without this output
affecting subsequent process input. In this open-loop
case, there is no regulation of process output. Controllers of many types exist. However, the
majority of all control in industrial applications is
accomplished with a specific class of controllers,
referred to as "PID controllers". A PID controller
has three parameters: the proportional gain KC, the
integral gain KI, and the derivative gain KD. The
output of a PID controller at any time is the sum of
three terms: KC times the current error, KI times the
accumulated (integrated) error over some past time,
and KD times the current rate of change (derivative)
of error. Several variations, simplifications and
extensions of PID controllers exist, but the above
description is sufficiently general for this
discussion.By tuning a PID controller--specifying suitable
values for the three parameters--all but the most
demanding processes can be adequately controlled.
With all PID controllers, occasional returning is
needed: real-world processes change over time for a
variety of reasons.PID tuning is often done manually and
iteratively. The process operator or control engineer
varies the parameters (in a principled or ad-hoc way)
until acceptable process behavior to a small change in
the setpoint is achieved. This can be a prolonged
exercise and it
