<ABSTRACT>
The base material in sheet form, according to the invention, is available in web form rolled onto reels (7). It consists of a base material (1) and is provided on both sides with an adhesive coating (2). A double-sided silicone-treated covering paper (release paper) (4) is arranged on the underside. This covering paper has transport perforations (5) extending on the lateral longitudinal edges. These edges can be severed by means of severing perforations (6).

<CLAIMS>
Film-like support material (1) for producing sample cards with a support 
film (10) provided on both sides with an adhesive coating (2) and a siliconized 

cover paper (4), characterized in that the roll-up, film-like support 
material (1) is applied in web-like manner and its support film (10) is 

completely covered on one side by a two-sided siliconized cover paper (4), 
which at least has the width of the support film (10) and has on the longitudinal 

sides in each case conveying perforations (5). 
Film-like support material according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the width of the support film (10) is equal to the width of the two-sided 

siliconized cover paper (4). 
Film-like support material according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
adhesive coating (2) extends over the entire width of the support film (10). 
Film-like support material according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the adhesive coating (2) extends centrally over the width of the support film 

(10) up to the area of the longitudinal side conveying perforations (5). 
Film-like support material according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the two-sided siliconized cover paper (4) in each case projects marginally 

over the support film (10), which has over the entire width a two-sided 
adhesive coating (2), by the width of the longitudinal side conveying perforations 

(5). 
Film-like support material according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the longitudinal edges carrying the conveying perforations (5) are separable 

by means of separating perforations (6). 
Film-like support material according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the separating perforations (6) run congruently with the edges of the 

support film (10).
