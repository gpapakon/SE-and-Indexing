<ABSTRACT>
A holographic security device in which the holographic effect is generated by the diffraction of light by a surface relief pattern on a film and which, when illuminated, generates a moire pattern produced from a pair of overlapping, regular arrays (3, 4) of lines or dots. Each array has a line of symmetry (7, 8), the lines of symmetry being aligned. The device exhibits an ordered variation in the form of the observed moire patterns in a direction parallel with the alignment direction of the lines of symmetry and a colour variation transverse to the alignment direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a holographic security device
and to items carrying such devices.Holographic devices such as three-dimensional
holograms are widely used as authenticatable devices on
security articles such as identification cards, credit
cards and the like. Conventional holograms comprise three-dimensional
object holograms which project the image of a
three-dimensional object which is easily recognisable for
authentication purposes. With the increasing
sophistication of counterfeiters, simple three-dimensional
holograms are no longer as secure as they once were. An
attempt was made in the past to produce a more complex
hologram as is described in GB-A-2136352. In this case,
three transparencies are overlapped, at least one of the
transparencies carrying a pattern which does not exhibit
any symmetry. One of the transparencies is given random
deformations so that when they are laid one on the next in
the stack, spaces occur between adjacent transparencies.
When the resultant stack is illuminated with laser light,
a three-dimensional holographic image is produced which is
very difficult to duplicate because the randomness of the
deformations in the transparencies gives particular
variations in the moire pattern of the hologram. Although
such a resultant pattern is very difficult to counterfeit,
the pattern itself is not particularly suitable when the
device is to be used for authentication purposes. The
pattern will have a random and rather messy form which is
not readily authenticatable by inspection.Another example of the use of holograms in the form of
moire patterns is describe in JP-A-62206582. This
documents aims to generate as complex a moire pattern as
possible which again makes it difficult to authenticate the
device.In accordance with one aspect of the present
invention, we provide a holographic security device in
which the holographic effect is generated by the 
diffraction of light by a surface relief pattern on a film
and which, when illuminated, generates a moire pattern
produced from a pair of overlapping, regular arrays of
lines or dots, wherein each array has a line of symmetry,
the lines of symmetry being aligned, and wherein the device
exhibits an ordered variation in the form of the observed
moire patterns in a direction parallel with the alignment
direction of the lines of symmetry and a colour variation
but substantially no form variation transverse to the
alignment direction.This aspect of the invention means that on, tilting a
hologram containing this feature to observe
