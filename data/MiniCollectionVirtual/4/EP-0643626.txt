<ABSTRACT>
Chiral catalysts for enantioselectively epoxidizing a prochiral olefin and for enantioselectively oxidizing a prochiral sulfide are disclosed, together with methods of using such catalysts. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the catalyst is a salen derivative which has general structure (I). In accordance with another aspect of the present invention is a method of producing an epoxychroman using a chiral catalyst. In accordance with this method, a chromene derivative, an oxygen atom source, and a chiral catalyst are reacted under such conditions and for such time as is needed to epoxidize said chromene derivative.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of asymmetric
catalysis. More particularly, the invention relates to the field of
organometallic catalysts useful for enantioselectively epoxidizing prochiral
olefins. Several advances in catalysis of asymmetric group transfer have
occurred in recent years. One such advance has been the discovery by K.B.
Sharpless et al. of the epoxidation of allylic alcohols which provides access to
enantiomerically pure synthetic building blocks. Unformmately, Sharpless
catalysis requires the presence of a specific functional group, namely an allylic
alcohol, on the olefin to be epoxidized. Naturally, this requirement severely
limits the variety of olefins which can be so epoxidized.Some success has been achieved in asymmetric catalysis of
unfunctionalized olefins. For example, K.B. Sharpless reported in 1988 that
certain cinchona alkaloid derivatives were effective ligands in the osmium-catalyzed
asymmetric dihydroxylation of trans-stilbene and various other
olefins. This method provides a practical route to certain chiral diols,
although cis olefins afford poor results.Aside from the catalysts disclosed herein, it is believed that
there currently exists no practical catalytic method for the asymmetric
epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins. Some progress has been made in this
area through the use of chiral porphyrin complexes. In particular, J.T. Groves
et al. reported in 1983 the asymmetric epoxidation of styrene by a chiral iron
porphyrin catalyst. Unformmately, the Groves system suffers several
disadvantages, namely, the porphyrin catalyst is relatively difficult to prepare,
oxidant proceeds to low substrate conversion, is limited to styrene derivatives,
and achieves enantiomeric excess (ee) values of less than about 50 percent.Given the broad synthetic utility of epoxides, a simple, reliable,
and practical procedure for asymmetric epoxidation of simple olefins is clearly
desirable. One class of chiral epoxide with synthetic utility is the group of
compounds generally known as epoxychromans, or epoxides of derivatives of
chromene. For example, the epoxide of 6-cyano-2,2-dimethylchromene has
been found to be useful in the synthesis of a compound known as cromakalim.
Two variations of cromakalim are shown in FIGURES 13 and 14. Both of 
these are believed to be potassium channel activators and have shown
considerable promise as antihypertensive drugs.As can be seen in FIGURES 13 and 14, the cromakalim
compounds have two enantiomers. It is currently believed that only one
