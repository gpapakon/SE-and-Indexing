<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel procedure for laminating 
flexible textile materials, and to a composition capable of 
adhering the textile materials to each other. Storage stable, solvent-free fast curing adhesive compositions 
have long been sought for use in laminating textile materials 
together. Certain polyether polyurethane prepolymers, such as those 
described in Henn USP 4,532,316, have been found useful as 
adhesives. Room temperature moisture curing by heating under humid 
conditions is relatively slow and these prepolymers do not lend 
themselves well to an on-line laminating procedure which produces 
finished final products immediately. Moreover, many of these 
prepolymers are not "breathable", i.e. do not pass water vapor 
(moisture hereinafter) in any applicable quantities through their 
mass and are not suitable for use where the laminated textiles are 
designed to "breathe" for wearer comfort. These disadvantages are overcome by the novel adhesive 
compositions of this invention, and by the process of this 
invention which is preferably carried out in an on-line lamination 
sequence.  
 The composition of this invention is 
   a storage stable adhesive mixture of 
A) hexamethylenediamine carbamate, and B) the reaction product of 
i) ethylene/propylene oxide polyol, and ii) a polyurethane prepolymer of 
( i) diphenyl methane diisocyanate ( ii) polytetramethylene glycol, and, 
optionally, (iii) 1,4-butanediol The process of the invention is a process for laminating a 
fabric to a polymeric membrane, which comprises 
1. applying the storage stable adhesive mixture to a 
fabric, 2. causing the membrane to be placed against the fabric 
on the side the mixture is on, 3. heating the combination at 150-180°C.  
whereby the heat causes the carbamate to decompose forming 
hexamethylenediamine and releasing CO2, which causes foaming and 
forces the composition to spread, and which causes the 
hexamethylenediamine to react with -NCO groups of the prepolymer 
thus curing the prepolymer. To make the adhesive composition of the invention, 
hexamethylene diamine (HMD) and ethylene/propylene oxide polyol 
(E/P polyol) are mixed together under an inert atmosphere, such as 
nitrogen. The ingredients should be substantially free of moisture 
(water). The amounts used should be such as to result in 20-50% by 
weight HMD and complementally 80-50% by weight E/P polyol. Carbon 
dioxide is passed through the mixture at a temperature between 45 
and 50°C to obtain a 20 to 45 weight % solids content of the HMD
