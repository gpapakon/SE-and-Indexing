<ABSTRACT>
A wireless communication device (10) is provided for maintaining acceptable acoustic coupling, increasing display and data input device capability and increasing antenna performance to encourage further miniaturization and weight reduction thereof. Two moveable housing portions (12) and (14) are moveable between a closed (18) and an open (20) housing position and matively engage to provide an expandable housing while aligning earpiece (26) and microphone (28) transducers on a center axis (30) of the device (10). Paging and radiotelephone functions of the device are configured responsive to the position of the housing portion (12). The housing portion has a lens for viewing a display (46) thereunder and keycaps for actuating a keypad (54) thereunder when the housing portion (12) is in the closed housing position (18). An antenna (56) is extendable beyond the moveable housing portion (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to housing
assemblies and, more particularly, to housing assemblies as
used with wireless communcation devices.Advances in computing, wireless transceivers,
displays, data input devices, batteries, materials and
mechanics have promoted the miniaturization and weight
reduction of wireless communication devices such as portable
radiotelephones. However, there are tradeoffs associated with
the advantages of such miniaturization.Firstly, smaller devices result in a shorter distance
between the earpiece and microphone transducers. Since the
typical distance between a human ear and mouth remains
unchanged, acceptable acoustic coupling between the earpiece
transducer and the human ear, and between the microphone
transducer and the human mouth is becoming more difficult
to maintain. Various solutions have addressed this problem
by slidably or rotatably coupling one or more moveable housing
elements to the main body portion of the radiotelephone. The
housing elements have earpiece or microphone transducers
disposed therein. The distance between the earpiece and
microphone transducers is increased by moving the housing
element to an open position during use and decreased by 
moving the housing element to a closed position when not in
use. Thus, reliable acoustic coupling is achieved when the
radiotelephone is in use without compromising
miniaturization when the radiotelephone is not in use.
Examples of these solutions are shown in U.S. Patent Nos.:
D297,735, D297,734, D326,091, D326,451, D326,452, D298,244,
D305,427, D300,827, D300,742, D304,189 and D297,736. However,
as the devices become even smaller, the distance between the
earpiece and microphone becomes even shorter and the
acceptable acoustic coupling is even more difficult to
maintain.Secondly, smaller devices have less space for display
and data input devices, such as keypads. The smaller devices
have compromised these functions by making display
characters and input keys smaller and thus harder to use.
Additionally, the market for advanced communication devices
is requiring more capability from the display and data input
devices which is contradictory to the trend of providing less
capability for the sake of miniaturization.Thirdly, smaller devices have less space for an antenna
thereby degrading transmission and/or reception
performance. Smaller devices, having smaller antennas, are
more susceptible to the well known shadowing phenomenon
produced by the position of the human head between the
communication device
