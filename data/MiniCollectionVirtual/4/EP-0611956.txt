<ABSTRACT>
In the dryer (7) for measuring the moisture of substances, the measuring cell (31) built therein is mounted in such a way that it can be extended out of the housing (5) of the dryer (7) together with the weighing pan (13). The balance (9) is operable both outside and inside the housing (5), so that the weighing of the material (23) to be dried can take place in a comfortable fashion outside the housing (5). The weighing pan (13) is accessible very well from three sides and no contamination of the drying space (25) with spilled material to be weighed (23) can take place. The drying process can be followed through the spy glass (21) mounted above the weighing pan (13). For cleaning the reflector (57) of the annular halogen lamp serving as heat source (11), and for replacing the halogen lamp, the housing part designed as a lid (19) can be opened.

<CLAIMS>
A drier having a housing (5, 105, 205), an incorporated 
precision balance (9, 109, 209) for determining the moisture content of a 

product to be weighed, a weighing pan (13, 113, 213) for receiving the 
product to be weighed, which is connected to the load-carrying means of 

the measuring cell of the balance, a heat source (11) arranged above the 
weighing pan for heating the product to be weighed, wherein the weighing 

pan is disposed within the housing in the drying operation, and means for 
making the weighing pan accessible for loading and weighing in the 

product to be weighed, characterised in that the weighing pan (13, 113, 
213) is designed to be extendable from the housing (5, 105, 205) for 

loading and weighing in the product (23) to be weighed. 
A drier according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
measuring cell (31) together with the weighing pan (13, 113, 213) is 

designed to be extended as an entire balance unit (9, 109 , 209) from the 
housing (5, 105, 205). 
A drier according to claim 2 characterised in that the 
balance unit (9, 109) is extendable from the housing (5, 105, 205), 

carried by a parallel guide means (39, 139) or by a pivoting means (239). 
A drier according to claim 3 characterised in that the 
parallel guide means has at least one guide rail (39) which is arranged 

in the housing (5, 105) and on which an extension member (35, 135, 235) 
carrying the balance unit (9, 109) is mounted. 
A drier according to claim 3 characterised in that the 
parallel guide means comprises at least one lazy tongs arrangement (139) 

whose rear end is connected to the housing (5, 105) and guided and whose 
front end carries the balance unit (9, 109).  

 
A drier according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that the balance unit (9, 109, 209) is mounted extendably from the 

housing (205), pivotably about a vertically disposed shaft (239). 
A drier according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in 
that the heat source (11) is fitted in the housing (5, 105, 205) above 

the weighing pan (13, 113, 213) and with the housing portion which 
carries it and which is in the form of a cover (19) is mounted on the 

housing (5, 105, 205) pivotably about a horizontal pivot axis (A). 
A drier according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in 
that the heat source (11) comprises a halogen lamp. 
A drier according to claim 7 characterised in that the 
halogen lamp is of an annular configuration at least in a portion-wise 

manner and the annular part is arranged concentrically with respect to 
the weighing pan (13). 
A drier according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in 
that a sight glass (21) is fitted in the housing (5, 105, 205) above the 

weighing pan (13, 113, 213) for viewing the product (23) to be weighed 
when the weighing pan (13, 113, 213) is pushed in. 
A drier according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised in 
that a cover glass (12) is fitted between the heat source (11) and the 

weighing pan (13, 113, 213). 
A drier according to claim 11 characterised in that the cover 
glass (12) is in the form of a protective filter for UV-rays.
