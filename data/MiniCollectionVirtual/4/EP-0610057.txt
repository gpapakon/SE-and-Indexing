<ABSTRACT>
A modular shifter (20) and method of assembly is 
provided with components assembleable in a common 

direction to facilitate assembly. The shifter includes 
a multi-piece base (21) adapted to attach to a vehicle, 

the base including a first side member (22) and a 
separate second side member (24). Cross support pins 

(54,56) are insert molded into one of the side members so 
that they extend laterally for connecting to the other 

side member and to space the side members apart. A lever 
subassembly (26) is pivotally mounted between the side 

members on a pivot pin (110) extending between the side 
members. A cable bracket (30) and a detent plate (28) 

are connected to the side members by the cross support 
pins, the cable bracket including a stabilizing flange 

(128) that abuts and is welded to the detent plate to 
stabilize the same. The lever subassembly (26) includes 

pawl means (90) for engaging the detent plate and further 
includes cable connector means (172) for operably 

connecting to a shift cable. The side members, the lever 
subassembly, the connector bracket, the detent plate, and 

the pivot pin are configured to be assembled in a common 
direction parallel to the axis (A) of the pivot pin 

(110), thus facilitating assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to shifters 
for automotive transmissions and, more particularly, is 
directed to an automotive transmission shifter which is 
adapted to facilitate assembly. Automotive transmission shifters are generally well-known 
in the prior art. These shifters normally comprise 
a base and a variety of parts which must be individually 
assembled to the base in various subassembly operations. 
Most shifters require that the base be repositioned 
several times during these subassembly operations or that 
the parts be assembled from multiple directions. 
However, this repositioning and multi-directional 
assembly wastes assembly time and also can add to poor 
quality if the parts are inaccurately oriented during a 
secondary operation such as welding, peening, or the 
like. Further, additional fixtures are often required to 
orient the base in each new position. Also, many shifter 
parts are secured in place by separate individual 
fastening means, thus leading to excessive assembly time 
and cost of assembly. Still further, the known shifters 
are not modular, and thus are not readily adaptable for 
use on different vehicle model lines. Thus, an improved shifter and method of assembling 
the same for solving the aforementioned problems is 
desired. The invention is set out in the claims but it can be 
explained that, in one preferred aspect, the present 
invention includes a modular shifter wherein major 
components are assembleable in a common direction to 
facilitate assembly. The shifter comprises a base 
adapted to attach to a vehicle, the base including a 
first side member and a separate second side member, and 
interconnecting means for interconnecting the first and  
 
second side members. A lever subassembly including pawl 
means and cable connector means is pivotally mounted on 
an axis of rotation between the base by a pivot means. 
The construction of these parts is such that one of the 
first side member, second side member, and lever 
subassembly can be supported in a fixture and the others 
of the first side member, second side member, lever 
subassembly, and pivot means can be assembled thereto by 
moving them along the axis of rotation so as to 
facilitate ease of assembly. Preferably, the pivot means 
is initially attached to the first side member so as to 
extend away therefrom and provide a support on which the 
lever subassembly is pivoted about an axis of rotation. 
The lever subassembly and second side member are 
assembled by inserting them along the
