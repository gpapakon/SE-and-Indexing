<ABSTRACT>
The device according to the invention for separating the fleece of fibres 2 from the combing (doffing) cylinder 1 in a carding machine including a stripper comb 3 downstream of the combing cylinder, is characterised in that it is made up of a toothed cylinder 5 interacting with the combing cylinder 1 in order to detach the fleece 2 therefrom, the stripper comb interacting with the said toothed cylinder at the beginning of carding in order to separate the fleece therefrom, whilst, at high speed, the fleece leaves the said toothed cylinder 5 directly without interaction with the stripper comb.

Apparatus for separating the fibre web (2) from 
the doffer roller (1) in a carding machine, comprising a 

toothed roller (5) cooperating with the doffer roller (1) for 
stripping the web (2) therefrom, and separating means for 

separating the fibre web (2) from the toothed roller (5) and 
for directing it toward an output member (4, 6), 

characterized in that the separating means are constituted by 
a fly comb (3) arranged for cooperating with the toothed 

roller when starting up the carding machine to strip the web 
therefrom, while, at high speed, the web leaves directly the 

toothed roller (5) without the fly comb acting thereon. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said toothed roller (5) rotates in the same direction as 

the doffer roller (1). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that said toothed roller (5) carries a 

clothing having triangular teeth, for example isoceles or 
equilateral. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the toothed roller (5) carries a 

clothing having rigid teeth. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that, in the case where there is provided an 

output calendering roller (4), the distance between the axes 
of the toothed roller (5) and the calendering roller (4) is 

comprised between 100 and 300 mm. 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the distance between the axes of the toothed roller (5) 

and the calendering roller (4) is approximately 200 mm.  
 
Apparatus according to one of claims 5 and 6, 
characterized in that the toothed roller (5) has a diameter 

of about 160 mm and the calendering roller (4) has a diameter 
of about 120 mm. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the toothed roller (5) is disposed 

between the doffer roller (1) and a converging downstream 
member on which the web (2) arrives, at low speed when coming 

directly from the fly comb (3) and at high speed when coming 
directly from the toothed roller (5).
