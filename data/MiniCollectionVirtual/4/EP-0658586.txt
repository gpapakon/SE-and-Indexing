<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a novel superabsorbent 
polymer which is readily hydrolyzed and conform to 

environment by reacting a polysuccinimide with a diamine in 
an aqueous solution or an organic solvent to partially 

crosslink the polysuccinimide, and subsequently or 
concurrently hydrolyzing the remaining imide ring with an 

alkali while controlling the pH; and the superabsorbent 
polymer thus obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a superabsorbent
polymer obtained by reacting a polysuccinimide (anhydropolyaspartic
acid) with a diamine compound and subsequently
hydrolyzing the reaction product or by reacting a polysuccinimide
with a diamine compound in an aqueous solution and
concurrently hydrolyzing the reaction product, and a process
for producing the same.Polymer compounds referred to as superabsorbent
polymers are known as polymers which absorb a large amount
of water. These superabsorbent polymers are prepared from
water-soluble polymers, but basically have crosslinking
structures which render the polymers water-insoluble.
Specific examples of the superabsorbent polymers include
partial hydrolyzates of starch-acrylonitrile graft polymers,
starch-acrylic acid graft polymers, crosslinked polymers
formed by crosslinking acrylic acid with a copolymerizable
crosslinking agent, hydrolyzates of methyl methacrylatevinyl
acetate copolymers, crosslinked polymers of polyvinyl 
alcohol base or polyethylene oxide base, and the like. Some
of these have already been put to practical use [Masuda, F.,
"Superabsorbent polymers - characteristics and trends in
development of application", Chem. Econ. Engineer. Rev.,
vol. 15, pp. 19 - 23 (1983)].These superabsorbent polymers are widely used for
fields including sanitary materials such as diapers and
hygienic articles, agricultural materials such as water-holding
materials for soil and sheets for seedlings, food-related
materials such as food-freshness-keepining agents
and dehydrating agents, public works materials or building
materials such as dew inhibiting sheets on buildings and
water sealing agents, and the like. Since these superabsorbent
polymers are not hydrolyzed, they can exist in water
or soil semipermanently.This durability is a desirable property for some
uses. However, it raises a problem in view of environmental
preservation after disposal because the materials are not
readily degraded to low molecules when used as throwaway
items represented by sanitary materials such as diapers and
hygienic articles.On the other hand, there have been several reports
or disclosures on the technique for preparing water-insoluble
superabsorbent polymers by crosslinking polyamino
acids which have excellent safety and degradability.There have been a technique which comprises esterifying 
the carboxylic side chain of a monoaminodicarboxylic
acid (acidic amino acid) such as polyaspartic acid or
polyglutamic acid, and crosslinking the side chain with a
diamine to form a
