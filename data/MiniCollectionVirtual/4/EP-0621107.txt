<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polishing
plate for polishing an optical fiber connector
ferrule end face mounted to the joining part in an
optical fiber connector for mechanically connecting
optical fibers, and to a constant range control
polishing apparatus and a constant pressure control
polishing apparatus for the optical fiber connector
ferrule end face.In contrast to fusion splicing for permanently
connecting optical fibers, an optical connector is a
joining device capable of detachably connecting
optical fibers with one another, and there have
heretofore been used various types of optical
connectors which can easily connect and disconnect
optical fibers.For example, there has been known a single-core
optical connector which is intended to achieve
connection of optical fibers with reduced
eccentricity or angular deviation (e.g. an 
eccentricity of not more than 1mm in the case of a
ferrule for a single mode optical fiber having a core
diameter of 10 mm), and which includes ceramic-made
ferrules (reinforcing cylindrical rod for joining),
optical fibers whose end positions are inserted and
fixed in the ferrules, respectively, and a split
sleeve having a precise inner diameter and a slit
along the length in which slit sleeve the optical
connector ferrules are inserted from both ends
thereof and abutted each other with the split sleeve
being tightened together with the both ends of the
optical connector ferrule.The optical connector, which has good connection
characteristics, is widely used in large amounts,
especially in the optical communication field.The above optical connector is of a type in
which the optical connector ferrules are directly
abutted each other. To improve the optical
connection characteristics, in these optical
connectors, use is made of the optical connector
ferrules whose ends each has a convex-curved surface.
The convex-curved shape is formed by polishing.
Therefore, polishing is required to have a high
precision, and improved workability and operability
are needed in the polishing work.To polish the end face of an optical connector
ferrule to a convex-curved surface, a three-step
polishing process as shown in Fig. 1A to Fig. 1D is
required. Specifically, in an initial condition
before polishing, as shown in Fig. 1A, an end face
211 of the ferrule 220 is a flat surface, and a fiber
220 and an adhesive 230 are protruded from the end
face 211. This is polished so as to have a convex-curved
surface by three-step polishing shown in Fig.
1B to Fig. 1D. In a first step shown in
