<ABSTRACT>
A radiant electric heater is manufactured by a method 
which involves providing a base (2) of microporous 

thermal and electrical insulation material having a 
substantially continuous surface, and providing a heating 

element (4) in the form of an elongate electrically 
conductive strip (5). The strip (5) is urged edgewise 

into the continuous surface of the base (2) of 
microporous thermal and electrical insulation material so 

as to embed and support the strip (5) edgewise in the 
insulation material along substantially the entire length 

of the strip to a depth corresponding to at least part of 
the height of the strip.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a
radiant electric heater and, more particularly but not
exclusively, relates to a method of manufacturing a radiant
electric heater for use with a glass-ceramic smooth top
cooker.Radiant electric heaters are known in which an element of
coiled bare electric resistance wire is supported on, and
secured by staples to, a layer of microporous thermal and
electrical insulating material compacted in a metal support
dish. Such heaters are described, for example, in
GB-A-1 580 909 and are incorporated in glass-ceramic smooth
top cookers.The term `microporous' is used herein to identify porous or
cellular materials in which the ultimate size of the cells
or voids is less than the mean free path of an air molecule
at NTP, i.e. of the order of 100 nm or smaller. A material
which is microporous in this sense will exhibit very low
transfer of heat by air conduction (that is collisions
between air molecules). Such microporous materials include
aerogel, which is a gel in which the liquid phase has been
replaced by a gaseous phase in such a way as to avoid the
shrinkage which would occur if the gel were dried directly
from a liquid. A substantially identical structure can be
obtained by controlled precipitation from solution, the 
temperature and pH being controlled during precipitation to
obtain an open lattice precipitate. Other equivalent open
lattice structures include pyrogenic (fumed) and electro-thermal
types in which a substantial proportion of the
particles have an ultimate particle size less than 100 nm.
Any of these particulate materials, based for example on
silica, alumina or other metal oxides, may be used to
prepare a composition which is microporous as defined
above.The microporous insulation typically comprises a dry
particulate microporous material as defined hereinabove
mixed with ceramic fibre reinforcement, titanium dioxide
opacifier and, for high-temperature use, a small quantity
of alumina powder to resist shrinkage. Such insulation
material is described in GB-A-1 580 909.Radiant electric heaters have also been proposed in which,
instead of an element of coiled resistance wire, an element
comprising an elongate electrically conductive strip of a
metal or metal alloy is provided, the element being
supported on edge on an insulating base. Arrangements of
this kind are described, for example, in US-A-600 057,
US-A-3 612 829, US-A-3 991 298, US-A-4 161 648 and
US-A-4 292 504. In US-A-600 057, a conductor is mounted on
a metal support, or in a

A method of manufacturing a radiant electric heater
comprising: providing a base (2) of compacted microporous

thermal and electrical insulation material having a
substantially continuous surface; providing a heating

element (4) in the form of an elongate electrically
conductive strip (5); and urging the strip (5) edgewise

into the continuous surface of the base (2) of compacted
microporous thermal and electrical insulation material so

as to embed the strip to a depth corresponding to part of
the height (h) thereof and to support the strip (5)

edgewise in the base along substantially the entire length
of the strip.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that
the electrically conductive strip (5) is provided in

corrugated form along its length.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the strip (5) is embedded such that a significant

proportion of the height (h) thereof protrudes from the
base of microporous insulation material.
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised
in that the base of microporous insulation material is

provided as a compacted layer inside a supporting dish (1). 
A method according to claim 4, characterised in that
in a first stage the base (2) is formed by compacting the

layer of microporous insulation material in the dish (1) to
less than a desired final compaction density; and then in

a second stage, during or after urging the strip (5) into
the base (2), further compaction of the microporous

insulation material is effected to obtain the desired final
compaction density.
A method according to any preceding claim,
