<ABSTRACT>
Compounds of the formula 

   wherein R is hydrogen, hydroxy, or fluorine, X is H₂ or =CH₂, and 
the 23,24-double bond is E or Z, are useful as agents for the treatment of 

hyperproliferative disorders of the skin such as psoriasis, as agents for the 
treatment of tumors such as breast cancer, as agents for the treatment of 

neoplastic diseases such as leukemia, and as agents for the treatment of 
sebaceous gland diseases such as acne and seborrheic dermatitis. 
They are prepared by removing the silyl protecting groups from 
corresponding compounds with silyl protected hydoxy groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to compounds of the formula

   wherein R is hydrogen, hydroxy or fluorine, X is H2 or =CH2
and the 23,24-double bond is E or Z.They are useful as agents for the treatment of hyperproliferative skin
diseases, such as psoriasis; for the treatment and prevention of neoplastic,
diseases, such as leukemia; for the treatment and prevention of tumors; and
for the treatment of sebaceous gland diseases, such as, acne and seborrheic
dermatitis.The compounds of formula I are highly potent in stimulating
differentiation and decreasing proliferation of human keratinocytes.
Accordingly, they are useful as agents in the treatment of hyperproliferative
skin diseases or disorders, such as psoriasis, basal cell carcinomas,
disorders of keratinization, and keratosis. They are also useful as agents in
the prevention and treatment of neoplastic diseases such as leukemia. In
addition, they are antitumor agents, capable of treating and preventing
tumors, such as breast tumors. The compounds of formula I are also useful 
for the treatment of sebaceous gland diseases, such as, acne and seborrheic
dermatitis.The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition
comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula I, or an effective
amount of a mixture of two or more compounds of formula I, as well as to
the use of the compounds of formula I for the manufacture of medicaments
for the treatment and prevention of the diseases indicated above.Exemplary compounds of formula I of the invention are:
26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-1α,25-dihydroxy-16,23E-diene-cholecalciferol;26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-25-hydroxy-16,23E-diene-cholecalciferol;26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-1α-fluoro-25-hydroxy-16,23E-diene-cholecalciferol;26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-1α,25-dihydroxy-16,23E-diene-19-norcholecalciferol;26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-1α,25-dihydroxy-16,23Z-diene-cholecalciferol;26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-25-hydroxy-16,23Z-diene-cholecalciferol;26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-1α-fluoro-25-hydroxy-16,23Z-diene-cholecalciferol;26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-1α,25-dihydroxy-16,23Z-diene- 19-norcholecalciferol.In the compound of formula I, R is preferably hydroxy or fluorine.Preferred compounds of formula I are:
26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-1α,25-dihydroxy-16,23E-diene-cholecalciferol;26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-1α-fluoro-25-hydroxy-16,23E-diene-cholecalciferol;
and 26,26,26,27,27,27-hexafluoro-1α,25-dihydroxy-16,23E-diene-19-nor
cholecalciferol.The compounds of formula I are prepared as hereafter described,
with
