<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic
control system of an automatic transmission,
particularly to a hydraulic control system for 4-speed
automatic transmission which can increase power train
efficiency by controlling line pressure and can improve
the responsiveness of shifting time during gear
shifting.A conventional vehicle automatic transmission has
a torque converter, a multiple stage transmission gear
mechanism connected with the torque converter, and
frictional elements actuated by hydraulic pressure for
selecting one of the gear ratios of the transmission
gear mechanism in accordance with vehicle operating
conditions.The hydraulic control system provides actuating
hydraulic pressure pressurized by a fluid pump and
required to operate the frictional elements and control
valves.A commonly used automatic transmission of a vehicle
has a fluid torque converter which generally includes a
pump impeller connected to an engine output shaft to be
driven thereby, a turbine runner connected to an input
shaft of the transmission, and a stator disposed between
the pump impeller and the turbine runner, so that 
hydraulic fluid is circulated by the engine driven pump
impeller through the turbine runner with the aid of the
stator which functions to deflect the hydraulic fluid
from the turbine runner to a direction where the fluid
flow does not disturb the rotation of the pump impeller
when the fluid flows from the turbine runner into the
pump impeller.The automatic shift is achieved by the operation of
frictional elements such as clutches or kick-down brakes
at each gear ratios. Also, a manual valve, the ports of
which are converted by selecting a position of a
selector lever, is designed to receive fluid from a
fluid pump and to supply the fluid to a shift control
valve. In case of a 4-speed automatic transmission, the
shift control valve has a plurality of ports controlled
by an electronic control system.One example of a hydraulic pressure control system
of an automatic transmission for a vehicle is described
in Figure 10, which shows a circuit diagram of a
conventional hydraulic control system comprising a
torque converter 1 attached to an engine through the
engine flexible plate and rotating at engine speed for
transmitting power of the engine to an input shaft of
the transmission gear mechanism, a damper clutch control
valve 2 for controlling the application and release of
a damper clutch to increase the power train efficiency
inside the torque converter 1, a regulator valve 5 for
regulating the
