<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a shimming system for 
superconducting magnets of the type that are C-shaped. Such 
structures of this type, generally, employ a passive shimming 
system which homogenizes the magnet field within the imaging 
volume. The present superconducting magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) magnets require cryogens to operate, either liquid 
helium or liquid helium and liquid nitrogen. Liquid helium is 
used in superconducting magnets not only for cooling but also to 
stabilize the magnet windings against motion induced 
instabilities. Cryogens evaporate and are lost during magnet 
operation and, therefore, require periodic cryogen delivery service 
and cryogen addition, with the attendant cryogen safety hazards. 
Furthermore, the use of cryogens complicate the cryostat 
construction since the cryogen containment vessels must be built 
in accordance with pressure vessel codes to withstand pressure 
surges as a result of magnet quenches or loss of vacuum in the 
vessel surrounding the cryogen containment vessel. The heavy 
cryostat containment vessel requires complicated supports and 
shields to position the cryostat containment vessel in the vacuum 
vessel and yet minimize heat conduction and radiation to the 
containment vessel from the ambient temperatures surrounding 
the vacuum vessel.  Helium leaks into the vacuum vessel surrounding 
the cryostat containment vessel are a common cause of failure in 
most superconducting magnets. Helium gas leaking into the 
vacuum vessel provides high heat conduction from the ambient 
temperature surrounding the vacuum vessel to the cryogen 
containment vessel containing the superconducting coils. Cryogen costs, specifically helium, are increasing 
and there is a limited supply which is economically recoverable. 
In many parts of the world helium is not available, therefore MRI 
systems based on niobium titanium (NbTi) superconductors 
cannot be operated. Therefore, a more advantageous 
superconducting magnet, then, would be presented if such 
amounts of the cryogen could be substantially reduced or 
eliminated. Exemplary of such prior art magnets which do not 
employ cryogens and which also allow patients to be imaged while 
either standing up or lying down is commonly assigned U.S. 
Patent 4,924,198 ('198) to E.T. Laskaris, entitled "Superconducting 
Magnetic Resonance Magnet Without Cryogens". However, while 
it is advantageous to be able to image patients while they are in a 
variety of positions, the magnet must be constructed such that the
