<ABSTRACT>
The marking device comprises an electronic part (2) consisting of an electronic circuit (20) and of an antenna, in the form of a coil (21), fixed to a support part consisting of a portion of strip of a flexible material (1) and covered by at least one layer of a thermoplastic material (12). By applying this device to a garment (11), and by entering, via separate electronic means (3), an electronic code inside a memory of the electronic circuit (20), it will always be possible to tag the garment (11) thus marked with the aid of a code reader apparatus (30).

Electronic marking device including an electronic part (2) having two
opposite faces, made up of an electronic circuit (20) having in particular a

memory part in which a code can be written and an antenna (21),

   characterised in that

   said electronic part is fixed by a first face on a portion of a flexible strip
(1) by means of a first layer of a thermoplastic thermo-adhesive or self-adhering

material (12), a second layer of thermoplastic thermo-adhesive or
self-adhering material (13) covering a seco
nd face as well as a first portion of a
peripheral surface of the said first layer, a second portion of the said peripheral

surface of the first layer as well as the second layer being able to adhere to an
object to be marked (11) under the effect of pressure and/or of heat.
Electronic marking device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the antenna (21) is made up of a winding, the two ends of the wound wire of

which are connected to two metal paths of an electronic circuit (20).
Device according to one of the claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the
memory part of the electronic circuit (20) is programmable.
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that
at least one of the two layers of thermoplastic material (12, 13) is separated

into two half-layers (12A, 12B, 13A, 13B) by a layer (12C, 13C) of a material
non-porous to moisture.
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that
the composition of the second thermoplastic layer (13; 13A) is chosen as a

function of the material making up the object to be marked.
Use of a marking device according to one of the preceding claims for
marking a garment.
Use of a marking device according to one of the claims 1 to 5 for
marking a piece of textile.
