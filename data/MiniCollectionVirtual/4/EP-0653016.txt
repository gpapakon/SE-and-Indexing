<ABSTRACT>
A filtering apparatus (12) includes a filter cartridge (28) which may be replaced or cleaned and reused. The filter apparatus also includes a heat exchanger (62) which receives cooling air to cool the exhaust prior to filtering. The cooled exhaust does not pose combustion problems for soot or the filter material in the cartridge (28). In addition to cooling the exhaust, a temperature-sensitive valve (36) opens and closes to prevent excessively hot exhaust gas from reaching the filter cartridge (28). The valve (36) includes bi-metal discs (52) which bow outward when the temperature increases and flatten when the temperature decreases. The discs engage a cover to an orifice and slide axially to open and close the valve (36). The apparatus also may include a back pressure valve (72) which will open when the exhaust flow is backed up to prevent damage to the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filtering 
apparatus for engine exhaust, and in particular, to a 
filtering apparatus having a reusable filter element and 
a heat exchanger which is particularly well-suited to 
filtering diesel soot. A heat override valve and back 
pressure valve may also be included. As concern for the environment increases, 
greater attention is being given to systems for 
eliminating damaging discharges from internal combustion 
engines. In the workplace, pollution created by 
combustion engines threatens the health of workers, as 
the particulate and other compounds contained in diesel 
exhaust may be carcinogenic. The problem is especially 
troublesome in enclosed environments such as warehouses 
or factories wherein diesel forklifts are often 
utilized. Fork lifts and other diesel engines are often 
operated in a cycling manner, that is, at maximum power 
for short periods which quickly raises engine and 
exhaust temperatures. Prior devices have not worked 
effectively during cycling to filter the exhaust. In 
addition, prior filtering units have generally been too 
expensive, ineffective, or too difficult to service. Since the most efficient pleated filter 
material for filtering exhaust gases may have a maximum 
operating temperature, there must be safeguards to 
prevent the filter from igniting due to the hot exhaust 
gases. Therefore, when a predetermined temperature is 
exceeded, the exhaust gases must be redirected away from 
the filter to prevent combustion. Preferably, the 
problem of overheating is avoided by keeping the exhaust 
temperature below the ignition temperature of the soot 
and/or filter element. Prior devices have had no way of 
cooling the exhaust to prevent excessive temperature 
build up.  
 Prior devices have had no way of cooling the exhaust to 
prevant excessive temperature build up. Should the exhaust temperature exceed a 
predetermined level, there has not been a satisfactory 
valving arrangement for redirecting the exhaust gases to 
prevent ignition of the filter element. Prior filtering 
apparatuses have not included temperature override 
devices to prevent filter ignition. GB 2 068 258 shows an emission control device. 
Although the device includes a bypass system, it does 
not provide a satisfactory override valve or a pressure 
relief valve. It can be seen then, that an improved filtering 
apparatus is needed which provides an effective reusable 
and replaceable filter element and which prevents 
overheating of the exhaust gases and includes
