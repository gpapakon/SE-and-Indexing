<ABSTRACT>
A non-return valve for pressure differences of the order of magnitude of 0.1 to 0.002 bar (0.04 psig) comprises a first hose connection (1) and a second hose connection (2), as well as a diaphragm disc (3) of a flexible material which is clamped between the two hose connections and can be lifted off a sealing lip (12) in the case of superatmospheric pressure. This results in a flow cross-section. In the case of superatmospheric pressure on the other side it shuts reliably within a minimum period of time. A high degree of pretension coupled with extremely short closure times and reliable closure are achieved in that a diaphragm disc (3) whose central part (3a) is essentially of uniform thickness is provided in its outer circumferential region (3b) with an annular thickening (3c), in that a first hub member (4a) of the first hose connection (1) and a second hub member (4b) of the second hose connection (2) form a cavity (5) which receives the thickening (3c) on all sides with the exception of one passage (4c), and in that a radially inner, outwardly pointing wall surface (6) of the cavity (5) rests against the thickening (3c) such that radially directed tensile forces can be transmitted on assembly of the two hub members (4a, 4b) in the diaphragm disc (3).

A non-return valve for medical applications, fluid technology 
and for pressure differences of the order of magnitude from 

0.1 to 0.002 bar, with a first hose connection (1) and a second 
hose connection (2) and with a diaphragm disc (3) made of 

flexible material arranged between both hose connections and 
adapted, in the event of excess pressure in the intake hose 

connection, to lift off a sealing seat (12) and, in the event 
of excess pressure in the outlet hose connection, to be applied 

securely and in minimum time to said sealing seat (12), the 
first hose connection (1) being arranged on a first hub part 

(4a) and the second hose connection (2) on a second hub part 
(4b) and the two hub parts (4a,4b) when mutually engaged at 

their frontal sides forming a valve body and the diaphragm 
disc (3) being retained between the hub parts (4a,4b), with 

the diaphragm disc (3) being of substantially even thickness 
in its middle portion and provided in its outer circumferential 

region (3b) with an annular bulge (3c) and the first hub part 
(4a) of the first hose connection (1) and the second hub part 

(4b) of the second hose connection (2) together forming a 
cavity (5) receiving the bulge (3c) all round with the exception 

of a passage gap (4c) of a size corresponding to the thickness 
of the middle portion (3a),with a radially inwardly situated 

outwardly directed wall face (6) of the cavity (5) engaging 
with the bulge (3c) in such a manner that during the joining 

together of the two hub parts (4a,4b) to make up the valve 
body radially directed tension forces can be generated in 

the diaphragm disc (3), the bulge (3c) and the outwardly 
directed wall faces (6) in the hub parts (4a,4b) being provided 

with approximately equal annular inclined faces (9) and the 
bulge (3c) being provided with radii(11) limiting its cross-section 

(10), and wherein the radially outwardly directed 
wall faces (6) of the cavity (5) form an annular projection 

(17) of semicircular cross section (16) on the associated 
hub part (4a or 4b).  

 
A non-return valve according to claim 1,characterised in 
that on the second hub part (4b) of a Luer-Lock connector (13) 

there are provided several circumferentially spaced lift-limiting 
knubs (14) which are situated axially opposite an 

annular sealing lip (12) formed on the first hub part (4a) 
of the first hose connection (1). 
A non-return valve according to claim 1 or 2,characterised 
in that the sealing lip (12) projects in the radial plane (18) 

relative to the annular projection (17). 
A non-return valve according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the two hub parts (4a,4b) are 

mutually connected by means of an internally situated annular 
projection (7) and an externally situated annular projection 

(8), the annular projections (7 and 8) interengaging one inside 
the other.
