<ABSTRACT>
A magnetoresistor is monolithically integrated with 
active devices (38, 40) by growing a thin film magnetoresistor 

(28) on a semiconductor substrate (14) after the substrate (14) 
has been doped and annealed for the active devices (38, 40). 

The magnetoresistor is made from a material (28) being grown 
through a window in a mask. The mask material and the 

magnetoresistor material (28) are selected such that the 
magnetoresistor is substantially non-adherent to the mask. InSb 

is preferred for the magnetoresistor material (28), Si₃N₄ for 
the mask material (24) and GaAs for the substrate (14). The 

non-adherence allows the mask to be substantially thinner than 
the magnetoresistor without impairing the removal of the mask 

after the magnetoresistor has been established.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetoresistive sensors, 
and more particularly to methods for fabricating integrated 
magnetoresistive sensors and the resulting sensor structure. Varying magnetic fields have been used in the past as 
a sensing mechanism for moving parts, such as rotating elements 
in an automobile. The rotating element causes a magnetic 
field to periodically vary, and the rate of variation 
is sensed as an indication of the rotational speed and/or 
position. A simplified system for measuring the rotational speed 
of a rotating element is shown in FIG. 1. A wheel or gear 
2 has a plurality of spaced protruding teeth 4 and rotates 
below a magnet 6. A magnetoresistor 8 that is provided on 
its own substrate is positioned in the magnetic field 10 
between the magnet and wheel, while amplification and (if 
desired) digitizing circuits are provided on one or more 
separate substrates 12 that are electrically connected to 
the magnetoresistor 8. The rotating wheel 2 is formed from a magnetic material, 
and thus attracts the field from magnet 6. The magnetic 
field at the magnetoresistor 8 is strongest when one of  
 
the teeth 4 is located directly below magnet 6, thus minimizing 
the distance between the magnet and the wheel. As 
the wheel rotates the field tends to bend along with the 
movement of the tooth, and thus traverses a greater distance 
as the tooth moves away from the magnet. These effects 
produce a reduction in the magnetic field strength at 
the magnetoresistor 8, which reaches a minimum when the 
magnet 6 is midway between two teeth 4. The magnetic field 
strength at the magnetoresistor increases again as the next 
tooth approaches, reaching a maximum when that tooth is 
located directly below the magnet. The field strength at 
the magnetoresistor thus varies periodically as the wheel 
continues to rotate, causing the resistance of magnetoresistor 
2 to fluctuate in a similar fashion. This results 
in a periodically varying output from the amplifier circuitry 
12. It would be less expensive and reduce the bulk and 
complexity of the apparatus if the magnetoresistor could be 
integrated with the output circuitry in a single monolithic 
structure. However, this has not be practical in the past. 
Magnetoresistors have commonly been grown in crystalline 
form, and then cleaved into individual resistor elements 
that are simply glued to respective substrates. Other magnetoresistor 
fabrication techniques are known in which the 
magnetoresistive element is monolithically grown on a
