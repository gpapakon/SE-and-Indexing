Device for picking up a cable drum and/or winding 
a cable thereon, having a gantry-like movable frame (1) 

on which two carrying arms (2) are held, which arms are 
provided with engaging elements (14) for picking up the 

cable drum (15) and are each height-adjustable via a 
lifting mechanism, characterized in that each lifting 

mechanism (3, 5a, 5b) is arranged in a swinging manner 
(4) on the frame (1), the carrying arm (2) itself being 

suspended in a sprung manner in a preselectable position 
on the lifting mechanism (5b) assigned to it by means of 

spring elements (7, 8). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the spring elements (7, 8) are in each case designed 

in two parts, which parts (7, 8) engage on the lifting 
mechanism (5b) in opposite directions. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
lifting mechanism comprises a lifting mechanism motor 

(3), a lifting mechanism spindle (5a) and a lifting 
mechanism nut (5b), characterized in that the spring 

elements (7, 8) carrying the carrying arm (2) are fixed 
on the lifting mechanism nut (5b) and on the carrying arm 

(2). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that bolts (6) accepting the spring elements (7, 8) pass 

through the lifting mechanism nut (5b) and the carrying 
arm (2) in the swinging direction, and in that the 

maximum spring movement is limited by an upper (21) and 
a lower (22) stop edge for the bolts (6) in the carrying 

arms (2). 
Device according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized  
 

in that a means (23) is provided for adjusting the 
carrying arms (2) in a central position between the stop 

edges (21, 22). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the spring elements in each case 

have a holding spring (7) and an adjusting spring (8) 
which engage on the bolt (6) in opposite directions. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the spring force of the holding springs (7) is more 

than the weight of the carrying arm (2) and of the quill 
shaft. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that a device (9) is provided for 

monitoring the central position between upper (21) and 
lower (22) stop edges. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the device (9) for monitoring the central position 

is a proximity switch which is arranged in this area, is 
preferably connected to a control unit and which, on 

reaching the central position after lowering the drum, 
switches off the lifting mechanism. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the device for monitoring the central position is a 

time relay cooperating with a limit switch (12) for the 
lifting drive, the limit switch (12) preferably being 

arranged in the area of the lifting mechanism motor (3). 
Device according to one of Claims 3 to 10, 
characterized in that the stop edges (21, 22) are formed 

by longitudinal slots (10) which are made in the carrying 
arms (2) and through which the bolts (6) pass.
