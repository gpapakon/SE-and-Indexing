<ABSTRACT>
Electron spark discharge (electroerosion) machine with a machining head including a rotating spindle designed to drive the electrode tool in rotation; at least one of the slides of a crossed slide system designed to shift it along the X and Y axes is mounted on a crossmember bearing on two shoulders located on either side of the working zone and is hollowed out at the centre in order to give passage to a sleeve in which is mounted the device for shifting the machining head along the Z axis; the crossmember itself has an opening designed to give this device the freedom to shift following the movements of the first slide; a second means is designed to shift either the crossmember or the device for shifting the machining head along the Z axis in the direction of the other of the X and Y axes. The device for the Z movement can pass through the superposition of the two slides of the cross slide system, so that the Z axis is coincident with the centre of symmetry of one of these slides. The bed (body) may form a tube delimited by four vertical walls, the hollowed-out crossmember constituting the upper face of the cube and resting on four pillars forming the corners of this cube, at least some of the four vertical walls being hollowed out to a large extent in order to make the working zone accessible.
