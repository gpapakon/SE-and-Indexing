<ABSTRACT>
A bending magnitude detecting device which can 
preciselydetect the bending magnitude of a shaft and which 

does not obstruct the high speed rotation of the shaft. A 
first coil 1 is disposed facing the outer surface of a 

shaft, and a second coil 2 is disposed in such a way that 
it faces the first coil 1 through the shaft. These two 

coils 1, 2 are connected to each other in series. In order 
to provide a difference between the inductances of these 

two coils 1, 2, for example the number of winds of the first 
coil is made greater than the number of winds of the second 

coil 2. By means of this kind of construction, the 
characteristic of an output signal S₀ obtained from the 

series connection point A of the two coils 1, 2 is offset, 
and, as a result, even when the bending magnitude of the 

shaft is in the extremely small range [a], the 

characteristic of the output signal S₀ has a constant 
linearity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for detecting the
amount of bending in a shaft such as a grindstone shaft, and
particularly to a device which can detect the bending
magnitude in a shaft with high precision.Hitherto, in order to find such quantities as the
grinding resistance acting on a shaft on the end of which a
grindstone is fitted, or a so-called grindstone shaft, a
device which detects the bending magnitude of the shaft has
been used. This kind of device has a target integrally
mounted in the outer surface of the shaft and first and
second coils connected to each other in series, and the
target is formed of a laminated electromagnetic steel plate.
The first coil is mounted close to the outer surface of the
shaft and facing the target, and the second coil is disposed
in such a way that it faces the first coil through the
target and the shaft. These coils are formed in such a way
that they both have substantially the same inductance. *) This bending magnitude detecting device is constructed
in such a way that when the shaft bends while a high
frequency voltage is being applied across the first and
second coils, it can detect the actual bending magnitude of
the shaft by wave-detecting and rectifying an output signal 
which is produced at the series connection point of the two
coils and whose absolute value corresponds to the bending
magnitude of the shaft.However, in this kind of conventional bending magnitude
detecting device, i.e. in devices which use two coils to
detect the bending magnitude of a shaft, even when a target
of a laminated electromagnetic steel plate is mounted
integrally with the shaft as described above, due to
hysteresis loss and eddy current loss caused by the high
frequency excitation voltage, etc., especially when the
bending range of the shaft is located in the vicinity of the
center of both the coils and the bending magnitude is
extremely small, the occurrence of a residual voltage in
the coils is unavoidable. Because it is impossible to
completely eliminate this residual voltage, in the
characteristic of the output signal obtained from the series
connection point of the two coils, as shown in Fig. 6(a),
in the range [a] where the bending magnitude is extremely
small, there is no linearity. In the characteristic of the
wave-detected output signal obtained when this output
signal is wave-detected and rectified, as shown in Fig.
6(b), in the range [a] where the bending magnitude is
extremely small, changes in the magnitude of the wave-detected
output signal are much smaller
