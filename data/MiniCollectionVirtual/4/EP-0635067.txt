<DESCRIPTION>
 PROBES FOR DETECTING COMMON L1VEBORN CHROMOSOMAL ANEUPLOIDIESBACKGROUNDIn situ hybridization has been a major research tool for molecular geneticists to visualize specific DNA or RNA sequences present in chromosomes, cells or tissues. Originally performed in an hybridization (FISH), are rapidly becoming the method of choice, because they can be accomplished faster, multiple signals can be detected at one time and hybridization signals can be more precisely localized. In general, however, non-isotopic methods have suffered from a lack of sensitivity. In addition, although simultaneous use of multiple fluors has been proposed in theory, in fact only one or two color FISH has been common to date.Because conventional prenatal cytogenetic analysis for chromosomal abnormalities requires 1 to 3 weeks, there has been great interest in applying FISH to prenatal diagnosis. Previous studies have demonstrated the general feasibility of detecting chromosomal abnormalities in interphase nuclei by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Cremer, T., et. al. , Hum. Genet. 60:46-56 (1982); Julien, C, et. al.. Lancet ii: 862-864 (1986); Lichter, P., Proa Natl. Acad. Sc|. USA: 85: 9664-9668 (1988); Pinkel, D.,Proa Natl. Acad. Sci. USA: 85: 9138-9142 (1988);); Lichter, P., Science 247: 64-69 (1990)).However, the probes used in these studies achieved limited hybridization efficiency due in part to constraints of probe composition, as well as variations in sample preparation and hybridization detection. In practice this meant that many chromosomes did not hybridize, and that of those nuclei that did hybridize, many had fewer hybridization signals than expected. For example, complex probes composed of the inserts from an entire chromosome library (e.g. as described in Pinkel, P., Proa Natl. Acad. Sci. USA: 85: 9138-9142 (1988), Lichter. P., et. al.. Hum. Genet. 80:224-234 (1988); Cremer, C.P., et. al.. Hum. Genet. 80:235-246 (1988); and Jauch, A., et. al.. Hum Genet. 85: 145-150 (1990)) generate a very large diffuse signal, such that the edges of the signal can be difficult to delineate, and overlap of the hybridization domains is 

common.On the other hand, alpha satellite repeat probes (e.g. as described in Willard. H.F. and J.S. Waye Trends Genet. :192-198 0987)), which hybridize to repeated sequences localized around the chromosome centromere, generate a brilliant hybridization signal, but present some difficulties in clinical utilization. In general, chromosome specificity of the repetitive probes is very sensitive to
