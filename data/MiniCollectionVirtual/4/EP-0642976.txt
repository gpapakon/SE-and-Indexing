<ABSTRACT>
Packaging machine which is intended, during the movement of assembled articles and blanks (D) made from cardboard and the like in a specific plane (P) and in the longitudinal direction (SM) of the machine, for folding the blanks around the assembled articles. Provided in the upper region of the machine are a blank magazine (200) and means (110 to 113) for transferring the individual blanks to the plane of the assembled articles. The magazine (200) is arranged laterally in relation to the longitudinal direction of the machine, the blank stack extending essentially transversely relative to the longitudinal direction of the machine and the transfer means (110 to 113) transferring the blanks perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the machine.
