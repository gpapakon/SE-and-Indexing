<ABSTRACT>
A surface-emitting laser system includes a laser (2) that 
emits a vertically divergent beam (20) generally parallel to 

the substrate (4) on which it is formed, and a turning mirror 
(18') in the path of the beam (20) that extends up from the 

substrate (4) to a level well above the laser height. The 
extended mirror area (24) reflects a greater portion of the 

beam (20) than prior planar designs, increasing the output 
efficiency and providing a smoother beam pattern. One fabrication 

method employs a masking and ion beam milling technique that 
uses an accumulation of redeposited material to form the 

additional mirror area, with a thick mask layer that is later 
removed guiding the redeposition. An alternate fabrication method 

involves epitaxial growth of an additional layer of material 
above the conventional laser epilayers, with the additional 

layer being subsequently removed from the laser region but 
retained in the mirror region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a surface emitting laser system 
including a substrate, a formed on said substrate to emit 
a divergent laser beam over and generally parallel to said substrate, said laser including 
an upper surface, and a deflecting mirror for deflecting said beam away from said substrate formed on said 
substrate in the path of said laser beam and including a portion 
that is generally in-line with said laser, and an extension 
extending higher than said upper surface of said laser. The invention relates further to methods of fabricating 
an in-line laser and deflecting mirror system from a substrate 
that includes an active lasing layer between a pair of cladding 
layers. Such a laser system and such a method of fabricating an 
in-line laser and deflecting mirror system are known from US-A-4 
950 622 as well as from "Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 53, No. 
11, 12 September 1988, pp. 938-940". Further, such a system and method are known from EP-A-0 
552 003 being a state of the art pursuant to Article 54 (3) 
and (4) EPC.  
 This invention relates generally to laser systems and associated 
fabrication methods for directing a laser beam away from a 
substrate, and more particularly to the use of an external 
turning mirror to redirect an in-line beam from a monolithically 
fabricated laser away from its substrate. Ultra-high speed interconnect links between integrated 
circuit (IC) chips and data busses are needed for 3-dimensional 
optoelectronic systems. Currently available electronic 
systems incorporate optical isolation and optical 
data paths between larger subsystems, but the optical elements 
are discrete. A more compact, less expensive and 
more reliable system would result if the optical elements 
could be monolithically integrated on the same chip substrates 
as the electronic circuitry as surface emitting 
(optical output directed away from the substrate surface) 
elements. Applications for such 3-D interconnects include 
computers and processors, optical displays, optical signal 
processing and computing, intersatellite communication, the 
pumping of solid state crystals, and visual displays. Three approaches have been developed to achieve out-of-plane 
laser emissions: 
(1) Vertical cavity lasers, in which the laser beam  
 
is initially emitted vertically upward and away from the 
substrate upon which the laser is formed. This type of 
laser is described in Tell et al., "High-power cw vertical-cavity 
top surface-emitting GaAs Quantum Well Lasers", Applied 
Physics Letters, Vol.
