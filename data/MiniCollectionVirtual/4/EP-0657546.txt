<ABSTRACT>
A method for assaying an activity of a prophenoloxidase 
activating enzyme (PPAE), comprising assaying at least X-Arg or 

Y produced upon contact of the PPAE with a peptide chain of the 
formula



X - Arg - Y



 
wherein X is an optionally labeled amino acid residue or peptide 

residue, having an optionally protected α-amino group or N-terminal, 
provided that the amino acid residue adjoining Arg is 

not Gly or Ala, and Y is an organic residue capable of binding 
to a carboxyl group of Arg by acid amide bonding or ester 

bonding, or an optionally labeled amino acid residue or peptide 

residue, having an optionally protected α-carboxyl group or C-terminal, 
the peptide chain capable of being hydrolyzed into X-Arg 

and Y by a PPAE derived from an insect. According to the 
present invention, PPAE activity can be quantitatively assayed 

with precision and a highly precise method for determining β-1,3-glucan 
and/or peptidoglycan, wherein said PPAE activity is 

used as an index, can be provided. In addition, the present 
invention enables detection of fungi and bacteria without 

multiplication by culture, which makes early diagnosis of 
microbial infections possible. The present invention is 

applicable to a wide range of use such as tests for microbial 
contamination of water and food, safety tests of therapeutic 

agents such as antibiotics and injectable preparations, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for assaying the
activity of prophenoloxidase activating enzyme (hereinafter
referred to as PPAE) and a method for assaying β-1,3-glucan and
peptidoglycan by utilizing said assay method.A cascade involving a series of enzymes and called
prophenoloxidase activating system (hereinafter referred to as
proPO activating system), which is concerned with melanin
formation in body fluid, exists in the body fluid of insects
and β-1,3-glucan, a fungal cell wall component, and
peptidoglycan, a bacterial cell wall component, are known to
trigger said cascade [Onishi, Annot. Zool. Jpn., 27, 33-39
(1954), Ashida and Onishi, Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 122, 411-416
(1967), Brunet, Insect Biochem., 10, 467-500 (1980); Ashida
and Yamazaki, Molting and Metamorphosis, 239-265, Japan Sci.
Soc. Press (1990)]. This action is ascribed to the β-1,3-glucan
recognition protein (βGRP; molecular weight 62 kD) exhibiting
specific affinity to β-1,3-glucan and to the peptidoglycan recognition
protein (PGRP; molecular weight 19 kD) exhibiting specific
affinity to peptidoglycan, which are present in said proPO
activating system. When β-1,3-glucan or peptidoglycan is
recognized by either protein, a series of cascade reactions 
begins. By some unelucidated reations including of the reaction of an enzyme
requiring Ca2+, a prophenoloxydase activating enzyme (hereinafter referred to
as PPAE) which converts
prophenoloxidase (precursor of phenoloxidase, hereinafter
referred to as proPO) to phenoloxidase (hereinafter referred to
as PO) is produced [Ashida and Dohke, Insect Biochem., 10,
37-47 (1980)].In view of such phenomenon, various studies have been performed
in order to establish a method for detecting bacterial
infections and fungal infections, and safety tests
therapeutic agents by assaying β-1,3-glucan and peptidoglycan
based on said cascade reaction.Currently, Limulus test reagents, which utilize an amebocyte lysate
from horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus, Tachypleus
tridentatus) having an in vivo cascade similar to that of
insects, have been used as reagents for detecting bacterial
infections and safety tests of therapeutic agents. Since the horseshoe crab does not
have a system which reacts with peptidoglycan, however, detection is possible only
for β-1,3-glucan and lipopolysaccharides. The use of the horseshoe crab system
thus excludes Gram positive bacteria having no lipopolysaccharides. In addition, the
reagent supply is critical, since horseshoe crabs (Tachypleus tridentatus) are only
availa
