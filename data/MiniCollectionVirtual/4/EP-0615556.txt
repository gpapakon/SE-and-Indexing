<ABSTRACT>
Aqueous solutions of an amine N-oxide such as N-methyl morpholen N-oxide used in the manufacture of regenerated cellulose can be purified by passage through a strongly basic anion-exchange resin. The resin is regenerated by treatment with (1) an aqueous solution of a strong inorganic acid such as hydrochloric or sulphuric acid and (2) an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved methods of
purifying aqueous solutions of tertiary amine N-oxides
used as spinning baths in the manufacture of
regenerated cellulose articles, especially fibres and films.Cellulose can be dissolved in certain tertiary amine N-oxides
(hereinafter also referred to as amine oxides) to
form a solution. Examples of such amine oxides include
dimethylbenzylamine N-oxide, dimethylethanolamine N-oxide,
dimethylcyclohexylamine N-oxide, and particularly N-methylmorpholine
N-oxide (NMMO). The solutions so formed can
be extruded through a die into an aqueous spinning bath to
form regenerated cellulose articles in the form of fibres or
films, depending on the shape of the die. Such processes are
described in US-A-3447939, US-A-3508941 and US-A-4246221.The used or spent spinning bath must be purified and
concentrated in order to recover and re-use the amine oxide
it contains. If purification is not carried out, the
recovered amine oxide and hence cellulose solutions made
using it become progressively more discoloured as soluble
coloured impurities accumulate in the system. Consequently,
regenerated cellulose articles will be produced which are
discoloured and thus of poor quality. Woodpulp used as a
commercial source of cellulose contains a low level of non-cellulosic
coloured impurities. Coloured impurities are also
formed by degradation of organic compounds during the
handling of solutions of cellulose in amine oxides at
elevated temperatures.The use of ion-exchange resins for colour removal from
aqueous sugar juices is known, and is described for example
in an article entitled "Ion Exchangers" in Ullmann's
Encyclopaedia of Industrial Chemistry, fifth edition, Volume 
A14 (VCH Publishers, 1989) at page 393. The preferred resins
are strongly basic resins used in the chloride form, which
contain quaternary ammonium groups -CH2N(CH3)3+Cl-,
preferably the highly porous types of resin referred to as
macroporous resins.US-A-4193817 describes a process for the production of
bottler's liquid brown sugar which involves passing remelted
brown sugar over a strongly basic anion-exchange
resin in the chloride form. The resin may be regenerated by
treatment with an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid,
containing for example 3.5% w/w HCl, followed by treatment
with an aqueous solution of sodium chloride and sodium
hydroxide, containing for example 10% NaCl and 1% NaOH.DD-A-254199 describes the purification of aqueous
solutions of N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, especially those
produced
