apparatus comprising left and right image pickup 

systems for picking up two images, left and right image 
memories for storing the left and right images picked 

up by the left and right image pickup systems, a

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processing
apparatus using an image pickup apparatus employing image
pickup devices such as the CCD (charge coupled device),
and more particularly to an image processing apparatus
using a multi-eye image pickup apparatus consisting of
a plurality of image pickup devices and imaging optical
systems such as lenses, etc.In EP-A-0 534 438 an imaging system for capturing
a wide field of view is described. The system comprises
an image sensor which is panned over the field of view
to produce a number of overlapping partial images from
a single viewpoint, and processing circuitry to
determine relative offsets between successive partial
images and to overlay them to produce a composite view.There are recently proposed multi-eye image pickup
apparatus for producing a wide panorama image or a high-definition
image, having a plurality of image pickup
systems each composed of an imaging optical system and
an image pickup device, by which images of a common
object are taken whereby image signals obtained from the
respective image pickup devices are used to produce a
combined image.As a method for obtaining the panorama image there
is one in which a plurality of image pickup systems
simultaneously take a plurality of images different in
object region, a same object existing in the images is
extracted, and the images are combined based on
information about relative positions between 
the images of the object, thus obtaining a combined
panorama image. As a method for obtaining the high-definition
image there is one in which a same object
exiting in the images is extracted similarly as in case
of the panorama image and an interpolation process is
carried out based on information about relative
positions in the images to newly obtain a high-definition
image.Fig. 12 shows an example of a multi-eye image
pickup apparatus based on the principle of the method
for obtaining the high-definition image, in which there
are a left image pickup system 1010L and a right image
pickup system 1010R and images of an object 1101 are
taken by the left image pickup system 1010L and the
right image pickup system 1010R. An image processing
apparatus 1120 performs corresponding point extraction
from a left image IL obtained by the left image pickup
system 1010L and a right image IR obtained by the right
image pickup system 1010R to combine them with each
other, whereby a single, higher-definition output image
Iout is obtained as compared with the image of the
object taken by each single image pickup
