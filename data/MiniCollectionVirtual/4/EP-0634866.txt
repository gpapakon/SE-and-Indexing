<ABSTRACT>
In an encoding circuit for a digital video signal, a digital video signal 
is subjected to given orthogonal transform to be converted into corresponding 

conversion data. Components of the conversion data are scanned in a given 
order to generate a main data sequence from the conversion data. The main 

data sequence is separated into at least two sub data sequences. First one 
of the two sub data sequences is encoded into corresponding words of a given 

variable-length code. Second one of the two sub data sequences is encoded 
into corresponding words of the variable-length code. 
An error concealment circuit is added on the decoder side.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a processing system for a 
digital video signal. This invention particularly relates to an encoder 
and a decoder for processing a digital video signal in a digital 
recording and reproducing apparatus such as a digital VTR (video 
tape recorder). The recording sections of digital VTR's include a signal 
processor for compressing a video signal by an efficient encoding 
technique using orthogonal transform. Such a signal processor has a 
series combination of an orthogonal transform circuit, a variable-length 
encoding circuit, an error correction encoding circuit, and a 
record encoding circuit. The orthogonal transform circuit subjects an input digital 
video signal to given orthogonal transform such as two-dimensional 
DCT (discrete cosine transform). For example, pixel-corresponding 
components of the input video signal which form one field or one 
frame are grouped into a given number of blocks each having 8 by 8 
adjacent pixels (8 pixels in the horizontal direction and 8 pixels in 
the vertical direction) according to the JPEG standards. The 
orthogonal transform is executed on every block. The orthogonal 
transform generates 8 by 8 pieces of data (DCT coefficient data) per 
block. Zigzag scanning rearranges 8 by 8 pieces of data into a  
 
sequence of data which is outputted from the orthogonal transform 
circuit to the variable-length encoding circuit. The variable-length encoding circuit has a section for 
quantizing the output data of the orthogonal transform circuit by 
referring to a plurality of discrete quantization levels. The variable-length 
encoding circuit also has a section for encoding the 
quantization-resultant data into words of a given variable-length 
code such as a two-dimensional Huffman code. The variable-length 
encoding circuit outputs the code data to the error correction 
encoding circuit. The error correction encoding circuit subjects the output data 
from the variable-length encoding circuit to given encoding such as 
Reed-Solomn encoding for error correction. The error correction 
encoding circuit is followed by the record encoding circuit. The 
record encoding circuit subjects the output data from the error 
correction encoding circuit to given encoding such as I-NRZI 
encoding for recording. The rate of compression of video data by such a signal 
processor affects the quality of an image represented by the 
processing-resultant data. A low compression rate and a high 
compression rate are chosen for a high-quality image and a
