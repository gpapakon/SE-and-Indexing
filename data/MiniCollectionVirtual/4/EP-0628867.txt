<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide 
color photographic material, which, as the case may be, 
will be hereinafter referred to simply as a photographic 
material. It is well known that a silver halide color 
photographic material contains coupler(s) and that the 
coupler(s) in the material is/are reacted with an 
oxidation product of an aromatic primary amine color 
developing agent, that has been formed by oxidation with 
the exposed silver halide in the material as an oxidizing 
agent, to form a color image composed of indophenol, 
indoaniline, indamine, azomethine, phenoxazine, phenazine 
and the related dyes. In such a photographic system, 
subtractive color photography is used, and color images 
are formed of yellow, magenta and cyan dyes. Of these, for producing cyan color images, phenol 
or naphthol couplers are generally used. However, since 
these couplers have unfavorable absorption in a green 
range, they have a serious problem that they noticeably 
lower the color reproducibility. Therefore, it is desired 
to overcome the problem.  
 As a means for overcoming the problem, 
heterocyclic compounds as described in U.S. Patents 
4,728,598 and 4,873,183 and European Patent 249,453A2 
(corresponding to U.S. Patent 4,818,672) have been 
proposed. However, these have a fatal problem that the 
coupling activity thereof is low. As couplers free from 
the problem, pyrroloazoles described in European Patent 
Laid-Open No. 0491197A1 (corresponding to U.S. Patent 
5,256,526) have been proposed. These couplers are 
excellent in point of the coupling activity of themselves 
and the color hue of the dyes to be formed therefrom. 
However, the pyrroloazoles disclosed in the patent had a 
problem that the color density of the dyes to be formed 
from them often fluctuates due to the fluctuation of the 
composition of the bleach-fixing solution (hereinafter 
referred to as "blix solution") to be used for processing 
the photographic materials containing the couplers. The 
fluctuation of the color density of the dyes formed was 
noticeable especially when the concentrations of 
thiosulfato ions and sulfito ions in the blix solution 
vary during continuous processing. The couplers had 
another problem with respect to the fastness of the color 
images to be formed therefrom in that the fastness of the 
image part having a relatively low color density is 
inferior to that of the image part having a high color  
 
density. For these reasons, it has been desired to 
improve the couplers in order to put them
