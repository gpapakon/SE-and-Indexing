<ABSTRACT>
In a method for saving the information of a data packet comprising a number of data words (W1 ... We) during the transmission between a transmitting device (2S) and a receiving device (2E), the uncoded data packet is supplemented in a first transformation block (17) by means of a data word (CC) which exhibits a bit pattern which is used uniquely for saving within a predetermined time interval. A supplemented data packet (W1 ...f) is sequentially coded in units of identical length in a device (19) using the cipher-feedback method, the first data word (W1) to be coded being transformed into a unique data word (W1
<
*
>
) in a second transformation block (18) before being coded and a coded data word (Yk) being generated by a nonlinear combination of coded data words in the device (19).

A method of safeguarding the information of a data packet (W
1...e
)
including a plurality of data words in transmission between a transmitting

device (1; 2
S
) connected to a transmission medium and a receiving device (1;
2
E
) connected to the transmission medium, wherein using the cipher feedback
method the unencrypted information of the data packet (W
1...e
) is encrypted in
the transmitting device (1; 2
S
) and the encrypted information is decrypted in
the receiving device (1; 2
E
), characterised in that

the unencrypted data packet (W
1;e
) is supplemented at a predetermined
position by a data word (CC) which has a bit pattern used once in a

predetermined period of time at the position for safeguarding purposes.
whereby a supplemented data packet (W
1...f
) which is unique in the period of
time is generated,
that the supplemented data packet (W
1...f
) is sequentially encrypted and
decrypted in units of equal length using the cipher feedback method, wherein

a unit is a respective data word (W
k
; Y
k
), and
that the first data word (W
1
) to be encrypted of the supplemented data
packet (W
1...f
) is modified by a transformation operation in such a way that,
when two data packets (W
1...e
) which respectively have identical first data
words (W
1
) occur in the transmitting device (1; 2
S
) during the period of time
for safeguarding purposes, the first data words (W
1
) to be encrypted in the
two supplemented data packets (W
1...f
) are different from each other.
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that an encrypted
data word (Y
k
) is generated by the exclusive OR operation of the unencrypted
data word (W
1
) and a further data word (T
k
), wherein the further data word
(T
k
) is produced by non-linear linking (F
k
) of a number (m) of encrypted data
words (Y
k-1
, Y
k-2
, ..., Y
k-m
). 
A method according to claim 2 characterised in that the non-linear
linking (F
k
) is implemented by exclusive OR operations between sums, wherein
a sum is formed from a random number (R1
k
; R2
k
; R3
k
) and at least one
encrypted data word (Y
k-1
; Y
k-2
; ...; Y
k-m
).
A method according to one of the preceding claims characterised in
that the uniquely used bit pattern of the data word (CC) supplementing the

data packet (W
1...e
) is produced from the current date and the clock time.
A method according to one of the preceding claims characterised in
that in the transmitting device the first data word (W
1
) to be encrypted is
modified by the exclusive OR operation with the data word (CC) supplementing

the data packet (W
1...e
).
Apparatus for safeguarding the information of a data packet (W
1...e
)
including a plurality of data words in transmission between a transmitting

device (1; 2
S
) connected to a transmission medium and a receiving device (1;
2
E
) connected to the transmission medium, wherein using the cipher feedback
method the unencrypted information is encrypted in the transmitting device

(1; 2
S
) and the encrypted information is decrypted in the receiving device
(1; 2
E
), characterised by a storage unit (14) having a key (Z), a
transformation chain (15) which has a storage means (33) and a first

transformation block (17) upstream of a second transformation block (18) and
a device (19) which is connected downstream of the second transformation

block (18) and which is connected to the storage unit (14) for encrypting
data packets using the key (Z), wherein the first transformation block (17)

is such that the data packet (W
1...e
) can be supplemented by a data word (CC)
having a bit pattern which is used once in a predetermined period of time

(T) for safeguarding purposes, and the second transformation block (18) is
such that the first data word (W
1
) to be encrypted of the data packet (W
1...e
)
can be modified by means of an exclusive OR operation with the data word

(CC) supplementing the data packet (W
1...e
) and the device (19) connected to 
the storage unit (14) is such that the cipher feedback method can be carried

into effect.
