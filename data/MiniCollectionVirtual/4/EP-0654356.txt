<ABSTRACT>
A wide track edge emitter assembly (10) is provided
which includes a series of edge emitter assemblies provided

on the opposing bottom surfaces of an angled rod (12). The edge
emitter assemblies are provided on opposing angled surfaces

in an overlapping and alternating arrangement. The focal
point of each of the edge emitter assemblies is adjusted so

that it falls along the same line on the light receiving
surface (16) for the wide track assembly. In this manner,

oversized documents having a width greater than 8.5 inches
can be printed using a single wide track assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a high 
resolution light source formed from a thin film electroluminescent 
edge emitter assembly and, more particularly, to 
a wide track edge emitter assembly adapted for greater than 
standard width applications. It is well known that an electroluminescent device 
generally, and particularly a thin film electroluminescent 
edge emitting device, may be utilized to provide an electronically 
controlled, high resolution light source. One 
such type of application is disclosed in United States 
Patent No. 4,535,341 to Kun et al. which is assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention. This patent discloses a thin film electroluminescent 
line array emitter structure which includes a 
first dielectric layer disposed on a common electrode, a 
second dielectric layer spaced from the first dielectric 
layer, a phosphor layer interposed between the first and 
second dielectric layers and an excitation or top electrode 
disposed on the second dielectric layer. At least one of 
the electrodes, for example, the excitation or top electrode, 
is segmented to form a plurality of individual 
control electrodes. The plurality of individual control 
electrodes in combination with the remaining structure 
define a plurality of individual light-emitting pixels.  Another example of a device which utilizes an 
electroluminescent light-emitting unit as a light source is 
illustrated in United States Patent No. 4,734,723. This 
patent discloses an electrophotographic printer which 
includes an optical head formed from a plurality of 
electroluminescent devices positioned along one edge of a 
substrate. A plurality of light wave guide strips are also 
formed on the substrate in association with the electroluminescent 
devices, and the wave guide strips serve to 
transmit the light from the electroluminescent devices to 
the other edge of the substrate which is brought into a 
face-to-face relationship with the printer photoreceptor. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application KoKi Number 
63-91998 discloses an EL luminescent edge emitter array in 
which the upper side of metallic electrode wraps around the 
reflecting end surface of the luminescent layer. Each of 
the EL elements in the array is surrounded by an insulating 
film whose refractive index is lower than that of the EL 
layer. The array further includes a discharge prevention 
area between the bottom electrode and the reflecting end of 
the top metallic electrode. United States Patent No. 4,951,064 discloses a 
thin film

a plurality of lens means (24) provided on said rod 

means (12), each of said plurality of lens means (24) 
positioned on one of said two angled bottom surfaces (18, 

20) of said rod means (12) adjacent to one of said plurality 
of edge emitter assemblies (22), said lens means (24) 

adapted to focus (26) and direct the light from said 
assembly (22) to said light-receiving surface (16).
