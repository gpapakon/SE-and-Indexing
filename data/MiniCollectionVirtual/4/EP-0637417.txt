<ABSTRACT>
Each data processing station is provided with an network-interface (RE), cooperating with a transmit/receive control device (ARC) which issues transmit or receive confirmation instructions. Each station includes a radio transceiver device, with a transceiver (RD) for the exchange of messages and an auxiliary rapid switching transceiver (R11) which detects collisions prior to the transmission of each message and changes state in response to a detected collision.

Data transmission method, according to which:

at least two data processing stations (Pa, Pb) are
envisaged, each provided with a network interface (Ia,

Ib), which is capable of co-operating by radio in a
chosen frequency band, or data channel, so as to

transmit messages on request, and to gather messages
received, as well as to compile orders confirming

transmission or reception,

   characterized in that in response to an order
confirming transmission of a message in a station, a

rapidly alternating transmission/reception (R1) is
performed in the said frequency band, according to a


transmission/reception comb
 chosen 
to be in principle

specific to this station, 
the phase of transmission of
this rapidly alternating transmission/reception being

performed in the form of a message which is not
representative of data
, a collision being recognized if
a signal of level greater than a first threshold level

is received during a substantial part of at least 
one
reception period
 of this rapidly alternating
transmission/reception, evincing concomitant

transmission from another station, after which, in the
presence of a recognized collision, a collision-processing

procedure can be undertaken.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the collision is signalled by a change of the

transmission/reception state. 
Method according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the rapid transmission/reception

is interrupted as soon as a collision is recognized.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that, furthermore, a collision in

reception is recognized by violation of a predefined
criterion.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the transmission/reception

channel is frequency-multiplexed.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the transmission/reception

channel is time-multiplexed.
Data transmission installation, of the type
comprising at least two data processing stations (Pa,

Pb), each provided with a network interface (Ia, Ib),
which is capable of transmitting messages on request,

and of gathering messages received, with a collision
detector means, and with a transmission/reception

management device (ARC), issuing orders confirming
transmission or reception,

   characterized in that each of the stations
includes a radio transceiver device operating in a

chosen frequency band, where it is capable of rapid
transmission/reception switching, and in that, in

response to an order confirming transmission of a
message, the said device operates in rapidly

alternating transmission/reception mode (R1), according
to a 
transmission/reception comb
 chosen to be i
n
principle
 specific to this transmission/reception
device, 
the phase of transmission of this rapidly
alternating transmission/reception being performed in

the form of a message which is not representative of
data
, a collision being recognized by the collision
detector means if a signal of level greater than a

first threshold level is received during a substantial
part of at least 
one reception period
 of this rapidly
alternating transmission/reception, evincing

concomitant transmission from another station, after 
which, in the absence of recognized collision, the

transmission of a part at least of the message is
carried out in the said chosen frequency band.
Installation according to Claim 7,
characterized in that the chosen 
comb
 is at least
partially random.
Installation according to either of Claims 7
and 8, characterized in that in response to a detected

collision, the transmission/reception state is modified
in a predetermined manner.
Installation according to one of Claims 7 to 9,
characterized in that the transceiver device is devised

so as to interrupt the rapid transmission/reception as
soon as a collision is recognized.
Installation according to one of Claims 7 to
10, characterized in that the network interface is

devised (RC) so as to recognize a collision in
reception by violation of a predefined criterion.
Installation according to one of Claims 7 to
11, characterized in that the transmission/reception

management device (ARC) comprises an automatic handler
(ARCA) forming a collision detector means, this

automatic handler possessing a first step, in which it
is placed in the active state upon an order confirming

transmission, so as to control the transmitter/receiver
in rapidly alternating transmission/reception mode

according to the said chosen 
comb
, and a second step in
which, in the absence of collision, it controls the

transmitter/receiver in respect of the transmission of
data.
Installation according to one of Claims 7 to
12, characterized in that the radio transceiver device

operates on a frequency-multiplexed transmission/
reception channel.
Installation according to one of Claims 7 to
13, characterized in that the radio transceiver device

operates on a time-multiplexed transmission/reception
channel.
