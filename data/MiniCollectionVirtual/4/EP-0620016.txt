<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a catheter comprising a tube-like 
basic body with a distal and a proximal end wherein a 

pressure channel (17) and a discharge channel (18) have been formed. 
At the distal end the discharge channel is connected with an 

inlet opening (9) and the pressure channel with a jet nozzle 
which empties into the discharge channel and is directed 

towards the proximal end of the catheter. Close to the 
proximal end the pressure channel has a pressure line (20) for 

the supply of liquid under pressure and is the discharge 
channel connected to the suction inlet (24) of a liquid jet pump 

which also comprises a pressure inlet (23) for the supply of 
liquid under pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hydrodynamic drainage
catheter comprising a basic body with a distal and a
proximal end in which a pressure channel and a discharge
channel have been formed. At the distal end the discharge
channel is connected to a suction opening and the pressure
channel to a jet nozzle which empties into the discharge
channel and is directed towards the proximal end of the
catheter.Such a catheter is known from the European patent
application 0 442 579 upon which the preamble of claim 1 is
based, wherein the inlet opening has been
formed in a side wall of the discharge channel and the jet
nozzle ends adjacent to the distal end of this opening and
is directed closely along it. Together with the inlet
opening, the jet nozzle forms an ejector. When liquid under
pressure is supplied to the jet nozzle via the pressure
channel, the liquid jet flowing from the jet nozzle and
directed along the opening will generate a suction this opening.
An important application of such a catheter is
therefore a thrombectomy-catheter for the removal of blood
clots or thrombi from the vascular system of a patient.When such catheters are very long and thin,
removal of the sucked up material through and from the
discharge channel can become difficult. The flow resistance
in the discharge channel becomes too great in order to
maintain sufficient flow in this channel with the aid of the
liquid jet from the jet nozzle.The object of the invention is to improve a
hydrodynamic suction catheter of the type described in the
preamble in such a way that also at a greater length and
smaller diameter its function will remain reliable.With the catheter according to the invention this
is achieved with the measures as characterised in claim 1. 
Herewith it is possible to utilize the liquid under pressure
already present to generate additional suction with the aid
of the liquid jet pump. Because of the extra suction the
sucked up material can still be removed in a reliable way
through a discharge channel of the catheter with a greater
length and a smaller diameter. The advantage of the known
catheter that no suction sources dependent on other sources
of energy need to be used, remains unchanged with the
catheter according to the invention.An advantageous development of the catheter according
to the invention is characterised in claim 2.
Connecting the catheter according to the invention becomes
consequently very easy.The measure as set out in claim 3 achieves that
the catheter forms together with the liquid jet pump one
whole;

<CLAIMS>
Catheter comprising a tube-like basic body (16) with
a distal and a proximal end, with therein a pressure channel

(17) and a discharge channel (18) wherein at the distal end the
discharge channel is connected with an inlet opening (9) and the

pressure channel with a jet nozzle (36) which empties into the
discharge channel and is directed towards the proximal end

of the catheter and wherein close to the proximal end the
pressure channel has a pressure connection (19) for the supply of

liquid under pressure characterized in that the discharge
channel is connected

to the suction inlet of a liquid jet pump (21) which furthermore
comprises a pressure inlet for the supply of liquid under

pressure.
Catheter as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
pressure line of the pressure channel and the pressure inlet

of the liquid jet pump are combined to form one pressure
line (4).
Catheter as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
liquid jet pump has been formed in a Y-piece (3) connected to

the basic body of the catheter comprising the pressure line
for liquid under pressure, a discharge tube and internal

connecting channels (40, 41).
Catheter as claimed in claim 3, wherein the Y-piece
has been manufactured by injection moulding.
Catheter as claimed in any of the preceding
claims wherein the flow resistance for liquid under pressure

in the liquid jet pump is greater than in the entire
pressure channel and nozzle.
