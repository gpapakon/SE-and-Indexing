<ABSTRACT>
An endosseous dental implant system includes a 
dental implant 100 having a multi-sided projection 112 at its top 

end and an internally threaded or unthreaded passage 110 
extending into the body of the implant through an opening 

in the projection at the top of the implant, and an 
abutment 108 having an internal passage for receiving a 

fastener 116 that passes through the internal passage of the 
abutment, and threads into the internal passage inside 

the implant. The abutment has a multi-sided internal 
cavity at its bottom end with each of the cavity sides 

perpendicular to the longi-tudinal axis of the abutment 
so that the cavity, when seated over the projection at 

the top of the implant, forms an anti-rotational, 
interlocking junction with the implant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an endosseous dental
implant system that includes at least two parts: a first
part called a dental implant, and a second part called an
abutment, post or insert. Such dental implants may have
a threaded external sidewall surface or a non-threaded
external sidewall surface, and the implants themselves
may be generally cylindrical in shape. Near one end of
such implants there may be one or more cross-vents
through the sidewall of the implant, and, sometimes, an
apical hole near the bottom end of the implant,
preferably connected to the cross-vents.The external sidewall surface may also have one
or more longitudinally extending grooves, and may include
a coating such as hydroxyl apatite over all or part of
the external sidewall surface. At the other end of such
implants is a projection, preferably a multi-sided
projection, for engaging, and interlocking, anti-rotationally,
with a cavity inside an opening in the
second part of the implant system. One or more of these
sides tapers downwardly and outwardly, preferably from an
upper, substantially flat surface, to a lower surface,
forming locking surfaces that engage and lock with
corresponding, substantially perpendicular wall surfaces
of the cavity inside the second part of the dental
implant system. Two-part endosseous dental implant systems for
insertion in a wholly or partially edentulous region of
the jawbone of a patient have been in use for a few
years. These implant systems may be completely embedded
in the jawbone, covered with mucosal tissue, and
permitted to remain in place while new bone grows around
the implant, and into and/or through one or more vent
holes in the implant itself. Once the implant has become
firmly anchored in bone, the mucosal tissue is reopened,
and an abutment or post is connected to the implant using
a screw. A prosthesis can then be connected to the
abutment or post.Many of these two-part implant systems have, at
the top end of the implant, an external, hexagonal
projection, sometimes called a male hex, which projects
upwardly from the top end of the implant, leaving a
shoulder surrounding the base of the male hex. An
abutment or post having an outer diameter that
substantially matches the outer diameter of the implant
is seated on the male hex to form a substantially sealed
connection. Some of these implants have an externally-threaded,
sidewall portion which can be screwed into an
opening formed in bone after bone tissue has been removed
from the jawbone, as depicted, for example, in U. K.

<CLAIMS>
An endosseous dental implant (2) for insertion in a
passage formed in the jawbone of a patient comprising a

substantially cylindrical body, and including at its top end, an
externally unthreaded, multi-sided projection (11), the implant

having an internal threaded passage (16) extending through the
projection and downwardly inside the body of the implant from its

top end; characterised in that at least one
of said sides of the projection (11)

tapers outwardly and downwardly from the upper end of the
projection to the upper surface (10) of the body and

the projection (11) has a size
and shape sufficient to fit within, and frictionally engage the

sides of an unthreaded, untapered, multi-sided cavity (19) at the
bottom end of an abutment (3), and to pass sufficiently far into the

cavity to form a sealing engagement between the bottom (18) of the
abutment (3) and the top of the body (10), said tapered side or sides

(13) (14) being of sufficient size, shape and degree of taper to
prevent rotation of the abutment (3) when the

projection (11) on the implant (2) is seated in the
cavity (19) of the abutment.
An implant (2) according to claim 1 in which the
projection (11) is surrounded by a substantially flat surface (10)

having a size and shape to seat firmly and co-extensively against a
corresponding flat surface at the bottom (18) of said abutment (3)

seated atop the implant. 
An implant (2) according to claim 1 or 2 in which the
external surface (8) of the implant (2) is threaded.
An implant (2) according to any preceding claim wherein
the projection (11) has at least two opposing sides (13) (14) that

taper outwardly and downwardly from the upper end (15) of the
projection (11).
An implant (2) according to any preceding claim wherein
all sides (13) (14) of the projection (11) taper outwardly and

downwardly from the upper end (15) of the projection (11).
An implant (2) according to any preceding claim wherein
each tapered side (13) (14) of the projection (11) tapers at an

angle in the range of about one degree to about two degrees.
An implant system (1) comprising an implant (2) according
to any preceding claim and an abutment (3), which comprises a hollow

body having a substantially flat bottom surface (18) and an
internal, multi-sided cavity (19) in an opening, the cavity having

the same number of sides (20) (21) as the projection (11) of the
implant and the sides (20) (21) of the multi-sided cavity (19) being

substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the abutment (3)
and each of the sides (20) (21) of the cavity (19) being

substantially untapered. 
An implant system (1) according to claim 7 further
comprising a fastener (4) which comprises a threaded shaft (4)

adapted to pass through an internal passage in the abutment (3), to
screw into the internal threaded passage (16) inside the implant

(2), closing the margin between the lower end (18) of the abutment
(3) and the upper end of the implant (10) and seating the cavity

(19) onto said projection (11).
