<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetic recording medium, a first Co-based 
magnetic layer 12 including oxygen is formed on a substrate 

11, and the layer 12 has an easy axis of magnetization 
inclined with respect to a film normal 14. Further, a second 

Co-based magnetic layer 13 including oxygen is formed on the 
first layer, and the second layer 13 has an easy axis of 

magnetization inclined with respect to the film normal. It 
is a feature that a dispersion of c-axis of a hexagonal close 

packed structure in the first magnetic layer 12 is larger than 
that of a hexagonal close packed structure in the second 

magnetic layer 13.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic 
recording medium having a high S/N ratio and a manufacturing 
method thereof. A magnetic recording medium has been developed to 
cope with a higher recording density, and a magnetic recording 
medium superior in read/write characteristics at short 
wavelengths is needed. At present, magnetic recording media 
used mainly are prepared by coating magnetic powders to a 
substrate, and characteristics of the magnetic media are 
improved to satisfy the above-mentioned need. However, the 
improvement comes near limits. A thin film magnetic recording medium is developed 
to exceed the limits. A thin film magnetic recording medium 
is prepared by vacuum deposition, sputtering, plating or the 
like, and it has superior read/write characteristics at short 
wavelengths. Materials such as Co, Co-Ni, Co-Ni-P, Co-O, Co-Ni-O, 
Co-Cr, Co-Ni-Cr and the like are tried for a magnetic 
layer in a thin film magnetic recording medium. A thin film 
magnetic tape including a deposited magnetic layer made of Co-Ni-O  
 
is already available commercially as a Hi-8 deposition 
tape for a video cassette recorder. A thin film magnetic tape is manufactured for 
example with oblique deposition on a substrate. A thin film 
manufactured with oblique deposition has an easy axis of 
magnetization oblique to a film normal of the tape. That is, 
the easy axis of magnetization does not exist in a film plane 
or along the film normal, but along a direction oblique 
relative to the film normal. For example, the easy axis of 
magnetization is oblique by 70° relative to the film normal 
in a plane including a longitudinal direction of the tape in 
the commercial Hi-8 deposition tape. The longitudinal 
direction means a length direction of a tape. A thin film magnetic recording medium having two 
magnetic layers deposited successively is already produced, 
and if the 2-layer medium is compared with a magnetic 
recording layer of a single layer, noise decreases by 2 dB for 
the same output signal. It is demanded that a magnetic recording medium has 
been developed to have a more compact size and to deal with 
a higher linear recording density. In order to satisfy these 
requirements, a line recording density and a track density 
have to be improved. Therefore, a higher S/N ratio, especially 
at short wavelength region, is desirable for a magnetic 
tape.  An object of the present invention is to provide an 
imaging device which solves these problems. In one aspect of the invention, a magnetic recording
