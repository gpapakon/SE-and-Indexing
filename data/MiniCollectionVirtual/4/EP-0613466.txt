<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to new transition metal dyestuffs and to their use in photovoltaic
cells. These dyes can be coated on titanium dioxide films rendering the device
effective in the conversion of visible light to electric energy.Titanium dioxide films (layers) are known for their semiconductive properties and this
property renders them useful for photovoltaic cells. However titanium dioxide has a
large band gap and therefore it does not absorb light in the visible region of the
spectrum. For solar applications it is important that the titanium dioxide film be coated
with a photosensitizer which harvests light in the wavelength domain where the sun
emits light, i.e. between 300 and 2000 nm. Thermodynamic considerations show that
conversion of solar energy into electricity is achieved in the most efficient fashion
when all the emitted photons with wavelengths below 820 nm are absorbed by the
photosensitizer. The optimal dye for solar conversion should therefore have an
absorption onset around 800nm and the absorption spectrum should be such that it
covers the whole visible domain.A second requirement for efficient solar light energy conversion is that the dyestuff
after having absorbed light and thereby acquired an energy-rich state is able to inject
with practically unit quantum yield, an electron in the conduction band of the titanium
dioxide film. This requires that the dyestuff is attached to the surface of the titanium
dioxide through suitable interlocking groups. The function of the interlocking group is
to provide electronic coupling between the chromophoric group of the dyestuff and the
conduction band of the semiconductor. This type of electronic coupling is required to
facilitate electron transfer between the excited state of the dyestuff band the
conduction band. Suitable interlocking groups are p-conducting substituents such as
carboxylate groups, cyano groups, phosphate groups or chelating groups with
p-conducting character such as oximes, dioximes, hydroxy quinolines, salicylates and 
alpha keto enolates. The electrons, photoinjected by the dyestuff, generate electrical
current in the external circuit when the photovoltaic cell is operated.Accordingly a new series of dyes has been developed to act as a photosensitizer.According to the invention, there is provided a compound of formula (I)
(X)nRuLL1

n is 1 or 2, preferably 2;Ru is ruthenium;each X independently is selected from Cl, SCN, H2O, Br, I, CN, -NCO and SeCN; andL is a ligand of the formula
