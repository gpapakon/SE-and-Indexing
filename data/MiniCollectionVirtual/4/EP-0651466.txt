<ABSTRACT>
Electrical connector (10) having a housing (16) and a 
plurality of electrical contacts (18). The housing (16) has 

contact receiving areas (20) with a general uniform cross-like 
shape. The electrical contacts (18) are one-piece serpentine 

shaped spring contacts connected to the housing (16) 
in the receiving areas (20). A center section (32) of the 

contact (18) has mounting wings (34) that are located in 
lateral apertures (28) of the cross-like shape to fixedly 

mount the contacts (18) to the housing (16). Opposite ends 
of the contacts (18) extend out of the receiving areas (20) 

for contacting contact pads on parallel printed circuit 
boards on opposite sides of the connector (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical connectors and, 
more particularly, to area array and edge array electrical 
connectors. Numerous different types and kinds of area array electrical 
connectors and edge array electrical connectors exist in 
the art. U.S. Patent 4,961,709 (Re. 34,084) discloses one 
such connector with coiled column shaped contacts. U.S. 
Patent 4,906,194 discloses a serpentine contact used in an 
edge array electrical connector. U.S. Patents 5,184,962; 
4,969,826; 4,927,369; 5,092,783; 5,061,192; and 5,069,627 
disclose other types of contacts and connectors. Even in 
view of the above mentioned contacts and connectors, there 
exists a need for a connector for connecting parallel 
electrical components that has very small contacts, which 
is dependable and relatively easy to manufacture, and can 
be manufactured at a relatively low expense. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention 
an electrical connector is provided comprising a housing 
and a plurality of spring contacts. The housing has a 
plurality of contact receiving areas. The spring contacts 
are one piece serpentine shaped contacts connected to the 
housing in the receiving areas. The contacts have two 
reversely orientated spring arms connected by a center 
section. Ends of the spring arms of each contact extend 
out of opposite open ends of one of the receiving areas 
and, the center section has mounting wings that connect the 
contacts to the housing.  In accordance with another embodiment of the present 
invention an electrical connector is provided comprising a 
housing and a plurality of electrical contacts. The 
housing has a plurality of contact receiving areas 
extending through the housing from a first side to a second 
side. The receiving areas have a uniform general cross-like 
shape. The electrical contacts are connected to the 
housing in the receiving areas. The contacts are comprised 
of a sheet of flat metal that is cut and stamped into dual 
spring arms with lateral mounting wings. The dual spring 
arms extend out of the receiving areas at the first and 
second sides and, the lateral mounting wings fixedly mount 
each contact to the housing. The foregoing aspects and other features of the invention 
are explained in the following description, taken in 
connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein; 
Fig. 1 is a partial schematic cross-sectional view of an 
electrical connector incorporating features of the present 
invention for connecting two parallel printed circuit 
boards

areas (20) extending through the housing (16) from a 
first side (22) to a second side (24), the receiving 

areas (20) having a uniform general cross-like shape; and 
a plurality of electrical contacts (18) connected to the 

housing (16) in the receiving areas (20), the contacts 
(18) being comprised of a sheet of flat metal that 

is cut and stamped into a pair of spring arms (36, 37) 
with lateral mounting wings (34), the pair of spring arms 

(36, 37) extending out of the receiving areas (20) at the
