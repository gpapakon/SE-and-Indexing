<ABSTRACT>
The grinding wheel (1) comprises a concavity (8) at the base of 
which there is provided a metal ring (4) which is non-abrasive but 

is sufficiently hard to resist wear by rubbing against the 
material being ground. The grinding wheel (1) hence removes 

material only until the metal ring (4) encounters the summit of 
the convex shape obtained. The ring (4) therefore operates as a 

stop-rest which automatically prevents superfluous removal of 
material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a grinding wheel for forming convex 
shapes which is applicable in particular to manual grinders. Grinding wheels in accordance with the introduction to claim 1 are 
known (see for example EP-A-0 397 955). Such grinding wheels are available with different mechanical 
characteristics so as to be suitable for operating properly on 
practically any commonly available construction material. The 
different mechanical characteristics are obtained by combining 
binders of different toughness with abrasive particles of various 
hardness and size. Although these grinding wheels operate satisfactorily, they are 
subject to wear requiring their periodic dressing or replacement, 
which is known to considerably influence costs. However the 
problem is particularly felt in the case of grinding wheels used 
on manually controlled grinders for rough-grinding convex shapes. In manually controlled grinders, whether of portable or non-portable 
type, identifying the moment in which grinding can be 
considered terminated is left to the experience of the operator. If this moment is not identified in good time, superfluous removal  
 
of material results, with consequent superfluous wear of the 
grinding wheel. In this respect, in such cases the grinding wheel 
progressively generates new convex surfaces which are not better 
in terms either of shape or of surface finish than those which 
here previously obtained and then immediately removed by the 
effect of advancing the grinding wheel. The object of the present invention is to provide a grinding wheel 
for forming convex shapes which obviates the aforesaid drawback, 
ie to provide a grinding wheel able to prevent superfluous 
material removal and hence superfluous wear thereof. This object is attained by a grinding wheel in accordance with the 
first claim. During grinding, the grinding wheel removes material only until 
the counteracting element engages the summit of the convex shape 
obtained. The counteracting element therefore operates as a stop-rest 
which automatically prevents superfluous material removal 
when it comes into contact with the surface being machined. The 
mechanical characteristics and the width of said counteracting 
element are chosen on the basis of the material for which the 
grinding wheel is intended, resistance to wear by rubbing and 
resilience (impact strength) being the reference characteristics 
for this choice. The mechanical characteristics of the counteracting element must 
be such as to limit at the

<CLAIMS>
A grinding wheel (1) for forming convex shapes applicable 
in particular to manually controlled grinders, comprising an 

abrasive mass (2) arranged about an axis of rotation (5) and 
shaped to present at least one concavity (8), characterised in 

that at the base of said concavity (8) and embedded in the 

abrasive mass (2) there is provided an element (4) which 
counteracts with the surface being ground, is of identical profile 

to that of the concavity and is coaxial with the axis of rotation, 
said counteracting element (4) being of a non-abrasive material 

which is more resistant to wear by abrasion and tendentially 
harder than the abrasive mass (2) in which it is positioned. 
A grinding wheel as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the abrasive mass (2) consists of a portion covering a 

support mass (9), the counteracting element being a ring (4) 
embedded only in said abrasive mass (2). 
A grinding wheel as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said counteracting element (4) is a ring of sintered metal. 
A grinding wheel as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said counteracting element (4) is a ring of sintered ceramic 

material. 
A grinding wheel as claimed in claim 3 or 4, characterised 
in that the material of the counteracting element is chosen from 

the following: hard metal, ceramic 
insert, cermet, cubic boron nitride and 

metal/ceramic.
