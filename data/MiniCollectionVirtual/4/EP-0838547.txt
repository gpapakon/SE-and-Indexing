<ABSTRACT>
A sequential catalysis of the ring opening polymerization of cyclic
organosiloxanes using a base catalyst that can be neutralized by a subsequent

redistribution and condensation Lewis acid catalyst, preferably a
phosphonitrilic compound, permits the rapid synthesis of functionalized and

poly-functionalized silicone copolymers such as alkenyl hydride copolymers,
a new composition of matter, which is a one component curable silicone by

means of hydrosilylation or peroxide initiated free radical polymerization.
The alkenyl hydride copolymer is formulated into a curable composition,

emulsified and coated onto an automobile airbag and subsequently cured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst and process for the preparation of hydrogen siloxane copolymers. The process of the present invention makes possible the synthesis of new compositions of matter, mixed silicone polymers possessing mixed functionalities. These new compositions allow for the manufacture of new articles of manufacture specifically airbag coatings.Most of the coating compositions used for automotive air bags are chloroprene resin blends. These chloroprene resin blends are also used in treating fibrous base materials in the form of woven, knitted and non-woven fabrics of polyamide fibers as by impregnation, coating or lamination. The resulting composite materials have excellent properties inherent to both the polyamide fibers and chloroprene resin and are useful in a variety of applications.However, these composite materials have some drawbacks. They tend to gradually lose their strength when they are allowed to stand above a certain temperature over a long term because the chloroprene resin releases hydrogen chloride which acts to scission the amide bonds of the polyamide fibers. Since the chloroprene resin is relatively non-elastic, the resin restrains polyamide fibers of the fibrous base material in the composite material to an excessive degree, thereby preventing free motion of the fibers. Thus, the composite materials have a relatively hard feel and low tear strength.To overcome these drawbacks, it has been proposed to use coating compositions comprising silicone resins which are superior to chloroprene resins with respect to heat resistance, weathering, and flexibility. Typical compositions are blends of a heat vulcanizable silicone resin and a tackifier and blends of an addition-curing type silicone rubber and a tackifier. These silicone coating compositions are applied to base materials of air bags, particularly for automobiles or the like to form coatings thereon which are generally about 40 microns thick. However, to meet a market demand for light weight, compact and low cost products, it is desirable to reduce the coating thickness.As the coating thickness is reduced, the conventional coating compositions tend to increase in burn rate. When they are applied to automobile air bags, such thin coatings permit the air bags to puncture upon explosive expansion of an inflator. As a result, the air bags lose gas tightness and are thus impractical because they fail to function for their intended purpose.Polydimethylsiloxane fluids may be conveniently prepared by any of several
