<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for hydrotreating a 
hydrocarbon oil employing at least a first and a second reactor 
vessel. It is foreseen that the amount of contaminating compounds such 
as sulphur or nitrogen containing compounds and aromatics, which 
are allowed to be present in hydrocarbon oils according to 
environmental regulations, will continuously decrease in the 
future. Therefore, there is much interest in processes with the 
help of which the amount of these compounds contained in 
hydrocarbon oils can be brought to a low level in a commercially 
attractive way. Processes for reducing the amount of sulphur or nitrogen 
containing compounds and aromatics, are in general called 
hydrotreating processes. These processes can be further divided 
into processes which are especially directed at saturation of 
unsaturated compounds such as aromatics and olefins, in which case 
they are called hydrogenation processes, and processes which are 
especially directed at reducing the amount of sulphur containing 
compounds and often at the same time also of nitrogen containing 
compounds, in which case they are called hydrodesulphurization 
processes. There are also processes which are specifically directed 
at reducing the amount of nitrogen containing compounds and in 
which only a relatively small amount of sulphur containing 
compounds are removed. These are called hydrodenitrogenation 
processes. With the expression hydrodesulphurization processes, 
which is used hereinafter, processes are meant which are either 
directed at removal of sulphur containing compounds and optionally 
a limited amount of nitrogen, or processes which are primarily 
directed at removal of nitrogen containing compounds and in which 
further some sulphur containing compounds are removed.  A large variety of hydrotreating processes are known from the 
prior art, for instance from US patent specification 5,114,562. In 
this document a process for hydrotreating a middle distillate has 
been described. The process comprises hydrodesulphurization of the 
distillate, cooling the effluent obtained and subsequently 
stripping it to remove hydrogen sulphide. The vapour phase portion 
from the stripping section is further cooled and thereafter further 
separated in a low pressure vapour-liquid separation zone. The 
stripped liquid fraction is hydrogenated. The effluent of the 
hydrogenation zone is removed from the reactor, cooled several 
times, and subsequently separated into a liquid phase stream and a 
vapour phase
