<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a method of producing antibodies or cell mediated 
immunity to an infectious organism in a warm blooded mammal which comprises 

administering to said warm blooded mammal intranasally, intramuscularly, or 
subcutaneously, live recombinant adenoviruses in which the virion structural protein is 

unchanged from that in the native adenovirus from which the recombinant adenovirus is 
produced, and which contain the gene coding for the antigen corresponding to said 

antibodies or inducing said cell mediated immunity.

<DESCRIPTION>
A major goal of biomedical research is to provide protection against viral disease
through immunization. One approach has been to use killed vaccines. However, large
quantities of material are required for killed vaccine in order to retain sufficient antigenic
mass. In addition, killed vaccines are often contaminated with undesirable products
during their preparation. Heterologous live vaccines, using appropriately engineered
adenovirus, which is itself a vaccine, seems like an excellent immunogen [Chanock R.,
JAMA, 195, 151 (1967)]. Our invention concerns vaccines using adenovirus as a
vector.Presently marketed adenovaccine comprises live, infectious adenoviruses in an
enteric-coated dosage form. Upon administration to the patient to be vaccinated, the
virus is carried past the upper-respiratory system (where disease-producing infection is
thought to occur), and is released in the intestine. In the intestine, the virus reproduces
in the gut wall, where, although it is not capable of causing adenoviral disease,
nevertheless induces the formation of adenovirus antibodies, thus conferring immunity
to adenoviral disease. In our invention, live, infectious adenovirus which has been
engineered to contain genes coding for antigens produced by other disease-causing
organisms. Upon release the virus will reproduce and separately express both the
adenoviral antigen and the pathogen antigen, thereby inducing the formation of
antibodies or induce cell mediated immunity to both adenovirus and the other disease-causing
organism. By "live virus" is meant, in contradistinction to "killed" virus, a
virus which is, either by itself or in conjunction with additional genetic material,
capable of producing identical progeny. By "infectious" is meant having the capability
to deliver the viral genome into cells.Roy, in European Patent Publication 80,806 (1983), proposed a method for
producing immunity to microbial diseases by the administration of a microbe containing
a foreign gene which will express an antigen of a second microbe to which immunity is
conferred. He states that preferred oral preparations are enteric coated. Dubelcco
proposed recombinant adenovirus vaccines in which the surface protein of adenovirus
is modified to contain in its structure a segment of foreign protein which will produce a
desired biological response on administration to animals. [PCT International
Publication WO 83/02393 (1983)]. Davis discloses oral vaccines derived from
recombinant adenoviruses. [UK Patent GB 2166349 B]. Human
