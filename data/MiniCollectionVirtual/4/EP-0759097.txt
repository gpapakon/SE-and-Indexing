<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for the production of phosphate-containing activating agents for the activation of surfaces of steel, zinc, aluminium or alloys of these metals, before phosphatization. The proposed process is characterized by the fact that an aqueous solution or slurry of one or more alkali metal phosphates, oligophosphates and/or polyphosphates, together with a second reagent, is irradiated with microwaves, the second reagent being titanium compounds or complexing agents from the phosphonic acid and poly(formyl carboxylic acid) group. The activating agents in question are formulated preferably in the form of an aqueous concentrate with a solids content of between 5 and 30 % by weight.
