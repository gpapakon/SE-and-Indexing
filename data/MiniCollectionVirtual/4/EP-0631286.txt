<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor memory circuit includes a memory 
cell array (3) having a plurality of memory cells. 

Column selection lines (BT) constitute connection lines 
extending from the memory cell array and are divided 

into hierarchies like a tree by selecting transistors 
(11). More specifically, a column selection system is 

hierarchically divided into column selection lines 
belonging to a first-stage column decoder (121) and a 

second-stage column decoder (122). Row selection lines 
are controlled by a row decoder (4). The semiconductor 

memory circuit also includes an ATD circuit (7) for 
detecting a transition of an address signal to generate 

a pulse , a pulse width control circuit (8) for 
controlling the width of the pulse to determine data in 

a sense amplifier (5), and a latch circuit (9) for 
latching readout data in response to the width of the 

pulse. A delay means is provided in the first-stage 

column decoder (121) of an upper hierarchy to which a 
small number of selecting transistors (11) belong and 

from which a signal rises at high speed. The delay 
means of the first-stage column decoder (121) causes 

the pulse from the ATD circuit to always operate the 
latch circuit (9) earlier than the timing of transition 

of data in the sense amplifier (5), thereby latching 
the preceding data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
memory circuit and, more specifically, to a 
semiconductor memory circuit having a function of 
latching data until the its subsequent data is 
determined in a sense amplifier in order to stably read 
out the data. FIGS. 1A and 1B are circuit diagrams showing a 
readout system of a conventional nonvolatile memory. In 
the circuit of FIG. 1A, a bit line (column selection 
line) is selected as follows. Address signals are 
supplied from an address pin to a column decoder 21 of 
first stage and a column decoder 22 of second stage 
through an address buffer 1. In each of the column 
decoders 21 and 22, a NAND gate 23 and an inverter 24 
are connected in series, as shown in FIG. 1B, and then 
connected to the gates of selecting transistors 11. The 
first-stage column decoder 21 outputs a first selection 
signal SS1 and the second-stage column decoder 22 
outputs a second selection signal SS2 to turn on the 
selecting transistors 11(a) and 11(b), respectively. 
Thus, one bit line BT is selected from a memory cell 
array 3. In contrast, an address signal is supplied to 
a row selection circuit 4 through the address buffer 1, 
and one word line (row selection line) WL is selected 
from the memory cell array 3. Data of a memory cell at 
the crossing point of the selected bit and word lines is  
 
transmitted to a sense amplifier 5 via the selecting 
transistors 11(a) and 11(b). The sense amplifier 5 
determines whether the data is "0" or "1", and outputs 
it via a buffer circuit 6. While the sense amplifier 5 is sensing data, an 
unstable state influences the buffer circuit 6 or data 
to be output. More specifically, the following drawback 
arises. In the memory cell selection process, the 
currently-selected bit and word lines are not changed to 
new ones instantaneously, but there occurs a difference 
in time between the selection of the current bit and 
word lines and that of the new ones. Just then, data of 
a memory cell other than a desired memory cell is read. 
If the read data is determined as data opposite to 
desired data by the sense amplifier, it is reversed. 
Thus, a large-sized transistor in the buffer circuit 6 
repeats turning on and turning off until the data is 
determined by the sense amplifier, which is likely to be 
a noise source of a power line. The noise source 
adversely affects access time. To eliminate the above drawback, an ATD (address 
transition detector) circuit 7 for detecting a 
transition of an address signal and generating a
