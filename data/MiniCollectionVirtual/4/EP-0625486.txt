<ABSTRACT>
Process for the production of a moulded pith article, preferably for insulation boards for thermal insulation of buildings, for heat and sound insulation in industry and for lining or interlining of packaging, wherein granular pith from sunflowers, maize or coconut is joined together by means of an adhesive and simultaneously protected against destructive microorganisms.

<CLAIMS>
Method to make plant component based insulating board for use in heat and
sound insulation and as a packaging liner, characterized in that the plant

components consist mainly of granule-type pith from sunflower, corn or
coconut, for example, and in that the pith


a) is sized from 0.2 - 5 cm and has calcium aluminate sulfate based
cement or cement hardening on an aluminate basis added at a pith-to-cement

weight ratio from 1:1.5 - 1:3,
b) is sized from 0.2 - 5 cm and mixed with water glass at a ratio of 1:3,
c) is sized up to 1 cm, has a cementing material added with mixing times
of up to 3 mins. for versions a) and b) and is compressed to give the

required dimensions.
Method acc. to claim 1 characterized in that the pith is sprayed with paraffin or
some other hydrophobing agent to prevent undesirable water absorption.
Method acc. to claim 1 characterized in that the cementing material used is of
animal or plant origin or is a plastic adhesive or bitumen or mineral cementing

agent such as water glass, silica so or bentonite.
Method acc. to claim 1 characterized in that the pith is sized 0.2 - 5 cm, has

calcium aluminate sulfate based cement or cement hardening on an aluminate
basis added at a pith-to-cement weight ratio from 1:1.5 - 1:3 and is slightly

compressed to give the desired dimensions resulting in board with a bulk
density of 100 kg/m
3
.
Method acc. to claim 1 characterized in that the pith is sized 0.2 - 5 cm, mixed
with water glass at a ratio of 1:3 and slightly compressed to give the desired

dimensions resulting in board with a bulk density of 70 kg/m
