<ABSTRACT>
A chain saw link or tooth is disclosed. The link or tooth (100) can be 
connected pivotally to other similar chain saw links to form the chain of 

a chain saw. The chain saw link has a link body (101) and one or more 
cutting inserts (106) fastened releasably to the link body. Each cutting 

insert is provided by a segment of a composite PCD or PCBN compact 
(10) and has a PCD (polycrystalline diamond) or PCBN (polycrystalline 

cubic boron nitride) compact carried by a carbide backing. When 
installed, the PCD or PCBN compact of the insert is exposed in a 

position to perform a cutting action in use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to chain saws and the manufacture of chain saw 
links. A conventional chain saw has an endless chain composed of pivotally 
interconnected links, and a motor for driving the chain. The links of the 
chain carry cutting inserts which perform a cutting action in use. The 
cutting inserts are generally made of steel and are rapidly blunted. It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel form of chain 
saw link which will have greater longevity than known links.  
 EP-A-0 468 214 discloses a cutting insert which can 
be used in chain saws. The insert has a support member, 
typically of a carbide, and a series of cutting members 
attached to the support members. The cutting members are 
rectangular in shape and are made throughout as an abrasive 
compact, typically a compact of polycrystaline diamond 
(PCD) or cubic boron nitride (PCBN). EP-A-0 028 418, upon which the preambles of the 
independent claims are based, discloses a chain saw link in 
which cutting inserts of round or e.g. polygonal shape are secured to the 
body of the link. The cutting inserts are formed as 
composite PCD compacts. EP-A-0 295 946 discloses a twist drill formed with 
seats in which cutting inserts are bonded so as to perform 
a cutting action. Each insert is provided by a segment of 
a slice cut from a composite abrasive compact, typically 
PCD. According to a first aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a chain saw link which is connectable to 
other similar chain saw links to form a chain, the chain 
saw link comprising a link body and, fastened to the link 
body, at least one cutting insert in the form of a segment 
cut from a composite PCD or PCBN compact such that the 
cutting insert has a PCD or PCBN compact carried by a 
carbide backing, characterised in that: 
the PCD or PCBN compact of the cutting insert extends 
along an edge of the cutting insert and presents a  
 
straight, acute-angled cutting tip which is transverse to 
the direction of chain movement in use, and  the carbide backing of the cutting insert is fastened 
to an upstanding shoulder on the link body such that the 
acute-angled cutting tip projects above the shoulder to 
perform a cutting action in use.   Preferably each cutting insert is in the form of a 
segment cut from a slice of a composite PCD or PCBN compact 
which has parallel, major surfaces, the slice itself being 
formed between parallel slice lines cut through the 
composite PCD or PCBN compact at an acute angle to the 
major surfaces thereof. The
