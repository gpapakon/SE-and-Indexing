<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems for 
handling and operating on articles. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a 
system using a fluid for holding, moving, detecting, 
and operating on articles and for logic and control 
elements. Many commercially available devices use 
gaseous and liquid fluids to inspect objects, sense 
objects, transport material, clamp material, or 
perform logic functions. Some examples are 
dimensional air gauges, interrupt able jet sensors, air 
conveyors, machining vacuum chucks, venturi-suction 
cup combinations, and fluidic logic modules. Many of 
these devices are fabricated in rigid plastic and 
metal configurations and are often attached to 
products and equipment with fasteners, by welding, 
gluing, or with other rigid attachment methods. Devices such as air tables and conveyors 
which provide a cushion of air on which an article can 
float are well known. However, while the article can 
float on the air cushion or air bearing, additional 
external devices or forces must be used to hold, 
translate, rotate, detect, or otherwise operate on the 
article. Transport tables which use directional air 
jets to transport articles also are known.  
 From US-A-3 761 002 there is known a fluid bearing having discrete 
holes formed by vortex restrictors. According to the 
embodiment of Figure 4 of US-A-3 761 002 the known device comprises 
three stacked layers, the middle one being provided 
with a curved passage leading to a round vortex chamber. The 
opening of the curved passage is oriented tangentially with 
respect to the vortex chamber. The upper layer is provided 
with a throughhole coaxially arranged with the vortex chamber 
and terminating in the outer working surface of the upper 
layer. It is the object of the present invention to provide a system 
which supports and operates on an article which can act on an 
article at orientations other than above a horizontal surface. This object is solved by an apparatus according to claim 1.  
 The present invention is an apparatus for 
handling and operating on an article. The apparatus 
includes a member having a working surface and at 
least one orifice which begins from an inlet, passes 
through the member, and has at least one outlet on the 
working surface. Fluid enters the member through the 
inlet, passes through the orifice, and exits through 
the outlet. The member is a web made of a plurality 
of stacked layers which form a laminate. At least one 
layer has one or more orifices. The orifices can be

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for handling and operating on an 
article (8) comprising a member (12) having a 

working surface (14), an opposing surface (16), and 
at least one orifice (18) beginning from at least 

one inlet (34), passing through the member (12), 
and having at least one outlet (22) on the working 

surface (14) to permit a fluid to enter the member 
(12) through the inlet (34) and pass through the 

orifice (18), wherein the fluid passing through the 
orifice (18) handles and operates on an article (8) 

located adjacent the working surface (14) while 
preventing the article (8) from contacting the 

working surface (14), wherein the member (12) is a 
web comprising a plurality of stacked layers (38) 

connected to each other along their major surfaces, 
and wherein the working surface (14) comprises the 

outer major surface of one of the outer stacked 
layers (38),
characterized in that
 
each layer (38) is provided with at least one 

throughhole connecting the major surfaces thereof 
and extending substantially perpendicularly thereto, 

the openings of each throughhole being in the 
respective plane of the major surfaces of each 

respective layer.  
 
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the orifice (18) 
is non-uniform and nonlinear to create an angular, 

non-linear, stepped path for the fluid. 
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the member (12) 
is flexible and the plurality of stacked layers 

(38) forms a laminate. 
The apparatus of claim 3, further comprising a 
fluid source (36) connected to the inlet (34) of  

 
the web, means for controlling the fluid from the 

fluid source (36) to the web and through the web to 
control the dynamics of the article (8). 
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the orifice (18) 
is oriented to cause the fluid to exit the orifice 

(18) through the outlet (22) and the orifice (18) 
and outlet (22) are configured to transport the 

article (8) along the working surface (14). 
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the orifice (18) 
is oriented to cause the fluid to exit the orifice 

(18) through the outlet (22) and the orifice (18) 
and outlet (22) are configured to rotate the 

article (8) adjacent the working surface (14). 
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the fluid exits 
through the outlet (22), and wherein the orifice 

(18) and outlet (22) are oriented to cause the 
fluid exiting the orifice outlets (22) to 

orientation independently hold the article (8) 
located adjacent the working surface (14) while 

preventing the article (8) from contacting the 
working surface (14). 
The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the orifice (18) 
is oriented to cause the fluid to exit the orifice 

(18) through the outlet (22) and is directed and 
shaped to transport the article (8) along the 

working surface (14). 
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the orifice (18) 
is oriented to cause the fluid exiting the orifice 

(18) to create a pressure differential between the
