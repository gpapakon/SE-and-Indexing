<DESCRIPTION>
This invention, in its broadest sense, relates to apparatus and a 
method for recovering a relatively volatile component of a solution 
from a less volatile component of the solution. However, it finds 
particular application to recovering solvent from the extract solution 
from a solvent extraction process. Solvent extraction processes are very well known, for example in 
the oil industry. Examples of solvent extraction methods are lubricating 
oil extraction, de-asphalting and lubricating oil de-waxing 
processes. Usually, economics dictate that the solvent used in the 
solvent extraction process be recovered and recycled for re-use in the 
extraction process. Numerous techniques are known for recovering the solvent from the 
extract solution. Typically, the extract solution is passed through a 
separator, for example a recovery tower, in which the solvent is 
recovered from the extract product. However, due to inevitable 
separation inefficiency and carryover within the separator, the 
recoverd solvent contains residual amounts of the extract product. 
Usually, because of the presence of these residual amounts of the 
extract product in the recovered solvent, this solvent cannot merely 
be recyled to the solvent extraction plant: rather, measures have to 
be taken to remove as much of the residual extract product as possible  
 
beforehand. Furthermore, trace quantities remaining after as much 
residual extract product as possible has been removed effectively 
reduces the capacity of the solvent extraction plant. Examples of solvent recovery processes of background interest to 
the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,482,453 (Coombs 
et al), 4,664,783 (Preusser et al) and 4,997, 547 (Emmrich et al). In a typical lubricating oil extraction process, a distillation 
feed, comprising a fraction boiling in the lubricating oil range from 
a vacuum distillation tower, and solvent are separately fed to a 
solvent extraction tower, from which raffinate, i.e. lubricating oil 
and wax, is produced as overhead and extract solution (i.e. a solution 
of aromatics in solvent) is produced as bottoms. One form of plant 
known to the Applicants for recovering the solvent from the extract 
solution from a lubricating oil extraction plant will be described in 
more detail hereinbelow with reference to Figure 1. Essentially, 
however, this plant comprises a recovery tower to which the solvent 
extract is fed, via a pre-heater, so that most of the solvent is 
vaporised as it enters the tower, the remainder

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for recovering a relatively volatile component of a solution 
from one (or more) less volatile component(s) of the solution, comprising a recovery 

tower (4) for recovering the majority of the less volatile component as a liquid bottoms 
product and for recovering the more volatile component in an overhead product 

comprising gaseous phase of the more volatile component and a residual amount of 
liquid phase of the less volatile component;
 
   which apparatus is characterized by the combination of: 


an isothermal separator (13) for separating the residual amount of liquid 
phase (and any other liquid present) from the overhead product; 
means (14) for returning the separated liquid from the separator as liquid 
reflux to the recovery tower (4); and 
a feed line (1), including a heater (3), for preheating said solution and for 
feeding it, mainly as a vapour, to the recovery tower (4); 
a branch line (10) connected between an upstream location, relative to the 
heater (3), in said recovery tower feedline (1) and a, or the said, overhead line (11) 

from the recovery tower (4) to the isothermal separator (13), for feeding a branched-off 
proportion of the solution in the feed line (1) of the recovery tower (4) to said overhead 

line (11), for reducing the temperature of the overhead product to the dew point of the 
more volatile component. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said isothermal separator 
(13) comprises a cyclone.  

 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising a 

stripping tower (6) having a feed line (5) for feeding the liquid bottoms product from 
the recovery tower (4) to the stripping tower (6), a gas stripping line (7) for supplying 

strip gas to the stripping tower (6) to strip residual amounts of the more volatile 
component from the liquid bottoms product, and an overhead line (9) for feeding said 

residual amounts of the more volatile component in vapour form, together with strip 
gas, to an overhead line (11) from the recovery tower to the isothermal separator, so 

that the overhead product from the recovery tower, together with residual amounts of 
the more volatile component and strip gas from the stripping tower (6), are fed as a 

mixture in said overhead line (11) to the isothermal separator (13). 
A method for recovering a relatively volatile component of a solution 
from one (or more) less volatile component(s) of the solution, comprising the steps of:- 


feeding the solution to a recovery tower in which the solution ascends 
mainly in vaporised form; 
contacting the hot ascending vapour with cooler descending liquid 
under conditions in the recovery tower such that the majority of the less volatile 

component is recovered as a liquid bottoms product and the more volatile component 
is recovered overhead in an overhead product comprising gaseous phase of the more 

volatile component and a residual amount of liquid phase of the less volatile 
component;
 
   which process is characterized by the steps of: 


(a) preheating a portion of the solution before it is introduced into the 
recovery tower;  

 
(b) conducting another portion of the solution, before the solution is 
preheated, to a mixing location with the overhead product containing the residual 

amount of liquid phase of the less volatile component, the temperature of the said 
other portion of solution being below that of the overhead product from the recovery 

tower, so that the temperature of the overhead product after the liquid therein has 
been removed therefrom is at or only slightly above the dew point of the more volatile 

component; 
(c) separating the residual amount of liquid phase of the less volatile 
component (and any other liquid present) from the gaseous phase of the more volatile 

component in an isothermal separation process, so that substantially no liquid phase 
remains in the overhead product; and 
(d) returning said separated liquid to the recovery tower as reflux. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein residual quantities of the 
more volatile component in the liquid bottoms product are removed by contact with 

ascending strip gas in a stripping tower and the removed residual quantities of the 
more volatile component, together with strip gas, are mixed with the overhead 

product containing the residual amount of liquid phase of the less volatile component, 
the temperature of the overhead product after the liquid therein has been separated 

therefrom being at or only slightly above the dew point of the more volatile 
component. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5, wherein the solution 
comprises the extract solution from a solvent extraction process.
