<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an equipment for inserting a tubular medicinal capsule on a support. In accordance with the invention, the opening extending through the capsule is expanded by blowing pressurized air into the opening immediately ahead the support being inserted into the opening. After the capsule has entered into its position, the pressurization is relieved, whereby the capsule opening contracts and locks the capsule on the support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an equipment 
for installing a tubular medicinal capsule on a support. 
The medicinal capsule concerned may be e.g. a capsule 
releasing a contraceptive subtance, and which is 
installed on a suitable support for fixing the capsule 
inside the womb. Such contraceptive means are known per 
se and manufactured in different ways. In these, the support 
is formed from an anchor-like element of an inert 
substance, on whose arm the hollow tubular medicinal capsule 
is installed. It is known to install such a tubular medicinal capsule 
on the support by swelling of the capsule in a suitable 
solvent and thereafter inserting the capsule in its swollen 
state on the support. The capsule shrinks as the solvent 
evaporates, and consequently becomes fastened on the 
support. In the method and equipment according to the invention, as disclosed 
in claims 1 and 2, a different 
principle is followed. This principle is based on the 
expansion of the capsule by an internal pressure to such 
a state that the support may be inserted inside it. When 
the pressure has been relieved, the capsule then returns 
towards its initial state and becomes fastened on the 
support. The characteristic features of the method and 
equipment according to the invention appear from the enclosed 
claims. The invention is described by means of the accompanying 
drawing, in which 
Fig.1 shows an inventive equipment in the initial step of 
the installation of a medicinal capsule; Fig. 2 shows the next step of the operating cycle of the  
 
installation; Fig. 3 shows the equipment in an installation step, where 
the medicinal capsule is in a closed connecting mould; Fig. 4 shows the equipment in an installation step, where 
the support is in the initial state of the installation 
step; Fig. 5 shows the equipment in the final step of the installation; Fig. 6 shows the equipment after the installation has 
been completed; Fig. 7 shows the equipment in the removal step of the 
ready product. Fig. 1 shows the basic parts of the inventive equipment 
in the initial step of the installation cycle. A connecting 
mould or housing 4 is in its open position and a 
pressure needle 7 is inserted in an opening 5 of the 
mould prepared to receive a capsule 1, which is brought 
to the connecting mould on a mandrel 6, when the mould is 
open. When the capsule supported by the mandrel and the 
pressure needle meet at the mouth of the opening of the 
mould, the pressure needle starts a withdrawal movement.

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for installing a tubular medicinal capsule (1), 
preferably a coated medicinal capsule, such as a contraceptive 

capsule, on a support (3), 
characterized
 in that an 
opening extending through the capsule (1) is expanded by 

pressurizing the opening immediately ahead of the support (3) 
being inserted into the opening, and thereafter fastening 

the capsule (1) on the support by relieving the expanding 
pressure. 
An equipment for installing a medicinal capsule (1) 
provided with a through-opening on a rod-like support 

(3), such as for installing a contraceptive capsule on an 
arm of an anchor-like suspender, according to claim 1, 


characterized
 in that the equipment comprises: 

a connecting mould (4), which is provided with a 
through-opening (5) and being dividable into two or more 

parts (4', 4'') relative to at least one plane trough the 
opening, the length of the opening exceeding the length 

of the capsule (1) to be installed; 
a mandrel (6) to be inserted into the opening (5) of 
the connecting mould (4) and withdrawable therefrom at one 

end of the opening (5), the outer diameter of which mandrel (6) 
essentially corresponds to the inner diameter of the tubular 

capsule (1) to be installed, and the length of which 
essentially corresponds to the length of the capsule (1) to 

be installed; 
a pressure needle (7) insertable into and withdrawable 
from the opening (5) of the connecting mould (4) at the end 

opposite to the mandrel (6) inlet end, the tip of the 
pressure needle (7) being open and the outer diameter of it 

essentially corresponding to the inner diameter of the 
hollow capsule (1) to be installed;  

 
means for inserting the support (3) into the connecting 
mould opening (5) from the same end as the mandrel (6), 

as well as for withdrawing the support therefrom; 
control means for controlling the mutual operation of 
the parts (4', 4'') of the connecting mould (4), the 

mandrel (6), the pressure needle (7) and the insertion 
devices of the support (3); and 
pressure means for pressurizing the pressure needle 
(7).
