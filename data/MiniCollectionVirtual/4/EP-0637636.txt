<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to steel for a machine
structural use, the free cutting characteristic, the cold
forging characteristic and post-hardening/tempering
fatigue resistance of which are simultaneously improved,
and which therefore is used to advantage as a material
for production of machine parts for use in automobiles or
the like.Steel used to manufacture machine parts of
industrial machines, automobiles and so forth must have a
satisfactory cutting characteristic, a cold forging
characteristic and a mechanical characteristic to be
realized after it has been hardened and tempered, and
more particularly the steel must have good fatigue
resistance.The cutting characteristic of steel is usually
improved by a method in which one or more elements, such 
as Pb, S, Te, Bi and P, are added to the steel. Among
the foregoing elements, Pb is widely used because of its
significant effect of improving the cutting
characteristic. However, since some elements are harmful
for the human body, an exhausting facility having great
size must be used in the process of manufacturing the
steel. In addition, there arise a multiplicity of
critical problems in recycling the steel. On the other
hand, the foregoing elements obstruct the improvement in
the cold forging characteristic of the steel.As described above, the free cutting characteristic
and the cold forging characteristic are usually
contradictory to each other. However, the steel for a
machine structural use must simultaneously have the
foregoing two characteristics. In order to satisfy the
foregoing requirement, graphite steel has been suggested
as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 51-57621,
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 49-103817, Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 03-140411 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
03-146618.However, inventors of the present invention have
investigated the foregoing methods and found a fact that
the methods cannot satisfactorily realize the
characteristics required for the steel for a machine
structural use. In particular, the methods cannot
satisfactorily realize desired fatigue resistance.For example, the method disclosed in Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 51-57621 encounters a limit to refining of 
graphite particles, e.g., to 45 to 70 µm, because only
Si, Al, Ti and rare earth elements are used as elements
for enhancing graphite forming. In this case, solution
of graphite does not proceed quickly at the time of
heating preceding quenching of the steel, thus resulting
in that the obtainable fatigue resistance is
unsatisfactory.
