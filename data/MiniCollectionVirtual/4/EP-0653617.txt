<ABSTRACT>
A fat-soluble substituting agent for substituting a 
dehydrating agent for producing a tissue preparation, 

comprising at least one selected from the group consisting 
of esters of fatty acid and alcohol and having a total 

carbon number of 6 to 50, preferaby 6 to 30 and ethers of 
the same kind or a different kind of alcohols and having a 

total carbon number of 6 to 50, preferably 6 to 30. The 
tissue preparation is prepared by fixing a tissue piece, 

dehydration-substituting with a dehydrating agent, 
substituting for the dehydrating agent with the fat-soluble 

substituting agent, embedding with an embedding agent, 
followed by slicing and staining (dyeing). It is odorfree 

and harmless.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel fat-soluble 
substituting agent for substituting a dehydrating agent used 
for producing a tissue preparation, and a production process 
for the tissue preparation using the above novel fat-soluble 
substituting agent. A morphogenic observation of a tissue preparation under 
a microscope constitutes the bases for a diagnosis, a  
 
pathology and a morphology in medicine and biology. In general, the tissue preparation is used in a region 
of an optical microscope. In recent years, a laser scanning 
microscope has been introduced, and an electron microscope 
preparation can be produced as well from an optical 
microscope preparation, which is expanding the applicable 
range thereof more than ever to strengthen a continuity to 
an electron microscope region in which small organs in a 
cell are primarily observed. Further, a technology in which 
DNA is from the tissue preparation is put to practical use, 
and the applicable range thereof has been expanded. Thus, 
usefulness of the tissue preparation has been increasing 
more and more. Now, a procedure for producing a general 
tissue preparation will be briefly explained. In principle, as for the tissue preparation, first 
tissue pieces (gross specimens) are cut off from various 
living bodies (organisms) and dissected specimens. Then, 
the tissue piece is prepared by a step in which this tissue 
piece is subjected to a fixing treatment, a steps in which 
water contained in the tissue is subjected to a dehydration-substituting 
treatment with a dehydrating agent, a step in 
which the dehydrating agent present in the tissue 
originating in the preceding step is substituted (cleared) 
with a fat-soluble substituting agent, a step in which the 
tissue is embedded with an embedding medium, and further a  
 
step in which the embedded tissue is sliced and dyed. In the above process for preparing the tissue 
preparation, alcohol series is most generally used as the 
dehydrating agent in the dehydrating step. After finishing 
this treatment, water contained in the tissue is substituted 
with alcohol. Next, it is aimed to substitute an embedding medium for 
alcohol in this tissue. Since as represented by paraffin, 
the embedding agent generally used is fat-soluble, it is 
substituted (cleared) with a substituting agent having a 
solvent property with a higher fat-solubility than alcohol. 
Xylene, benzene, chloroform etc. are used for this fat-soluble 
substituting agent. Finally, the tissue thus obtained is dipped in an 
embed
