<ABSTRACT>
Arrangement and method for the controlling of the traffic parameters of the ATM cell flow according to the so-called "Leaky Bucket" principle in an exchange termination (ET) including a header processing and translation unit (HTU). A plurality of policing units (PU1, PU2, PU3, PU4), for the control of the peak (Rp) and mean (Rm) bit rate by discriminating also among the cells pertaining to the higher priority flow (CLP=0) and the one pertaining to the lower priority flow (CLP=1), are provided. The units are activated in parallel by the said header processing and translation unit (HTU) and connected to a combinatorial network (RC). In the case of violation of the negotiated parameters, the higher priority cell may be declassed and treated like the other lower priority ones, or may be discarded. In the units, the updating is performed in the next controlling cycle of the cell relating to the same virtual channel/virtual path.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a telecommunication systems using 
a special numerical technique, called ATM (Asynchronous 
Transfer Mode), for the transmission and/or the switching 
communication of vocal and video signals and data. The ATM technique is considered as the more profitable 
solution for the multiplexing and switching of the public 
communication networks towards the future Broad band 
Integrated Services Digital Network(B-ISDN). In the ATM technique the information relating to the 
various users and services are organized as contiguous 
units having a fixed length of about 400 bits, called 
cells. The cell bits are subdivided into a field containing 
the information to be exchanged (payload) and into a 
heading field (header) containing the information necessary 
to route (to address)the cells through the switching 
network along with other service information. The cells are received by line interfaces at the input of a 
switching node essentially consisting of a controlling part 
and a structure performing the switching of the cells. During the call set up phase, a negotiation occurs between 
the user and the network operator, during which one or more 
traffic parameters of the connection (VC/VP or virtual 
channel/virtual path) are negotiated. According to these parameters the network operator performs 
an allocation of the network resources to the call in 
question, so to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) 
contracted with the user. This latter, on his own behalf, 
undertakes to comply, for the duration of the call, the 
parameters negotiated in the call set up phase. To protect the network from the possibility of any 
malfunctions whatsoever or from behaviours of the user not 
complying with what has been negotiated, at the input of  
 
the network a controlling of the usage parameters or UPC 
(Usage Parameter Control), called "policing", is carried 
on. This is performed by taking under control the above 
mentioned parameters for the whole duration of the call and 
by intervening discarding the cells in excess if it is 
necessary so to avoid congestion situations which shall 
result in the degradation of the network performances in 
terms of QoS offered to the users. In order to eliminate the cells in excess according to 
criteria which take into account the traffic negotiated 
between the network operator and each user, a control 
method called "Leaky Bucket", has been proposed. This method, specified in principle in Fig. 1, may be 
conceptually considered as consisting of a counter
