<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of synergistic preparation mixtures comprising at least two different pigments of the quinacridone, anthraquinone, peryline, indigo, quinophthalone, isindolinone, isoindoline, dioxazine, phthalocyanine, diketopyrrolopyrrole or azo series, characterised in that at least two compounds of the formula A(B)x (I), in which x is an integer between 1 and 4, A is a radical of a dye of quinacridone, anthraquinone, peryline, indigo, quinophthalone, isindolinone, isoindoline, dioxazine, phthalocyanine, diketopyrrolopyrrole or azo series, which contains x nitrogen atoms attached to B, preferably having at least one immediately adjacent or conjugated carbonyl group, and B is a group of the formula

 in powder form are mixed by conventional methods and dissolved in an organic solvent, or first dissolved, and the solutions are mixed and then the pigment mixture consisting of the corresponding pigments of the formula A (H)x, in which A and x are as defined above, is precipitated by thermal, photolytic or chemical treatment. For the definitions of the substituents and symbols R1, R2, R3. R4, Q, X, Y, Z, m, n and p, reference is made to claim 1. The pigment mixtures prepared by this process display properties, both colour properties and fastness properties, which are surprisingly better than those of the same pigment mixtures prepared by conventional methods.
