<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates
to the use of an ibuprofen-cyclodextrin clathrate complex suitable for formulation in
aqueous solution as a hot drink.Ibuprofen, (±)-2-(p-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, belongs to the group of
non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDs) and is widely indicated
for the relief of pain and inflammation in disease states such as arthritis
and for treatment of symptoms associated with the common cold and flu.
Formulation of the drug into a preparation suitable for oral
administration, in particular into a water-soluble form suitable for liquid
dosing is complicated by its poor water solubility, its irritating odour and
its unpleasant taste. It is an object of the present invention to provide a
palatable pharmaceutical composition containing ibuprofen formulated for
oral dosing as an aqueous solution.The ability of drug-cyclodextrin complexes to enhance water solubility and
to mask unpleasant taste and odour has been known for many years. In
this respect, ibuprofen has proved to be very suitable as a candidate for
complexation with cyclodextrins.Japanese patent publication, JP 56-46837 (Kowa Yakuhin Kogyo)
discloses a method for the preparation of an ibuprofen-β-cyclodextrin
clathrate complex involving the combination of ibuprofen with β-cyclodextrin
in water at elevated temperature and isolation of the
clathrate by spray-drying. This method is reported to yield a product
containing a high percentage of ibuprofen with a molar ratio of ibuprofen
to β-cyclodextrin in excess of 0.7. The increase in water solubility of the
drag is considerable, being raised more than 8-fold from 10.44mg per
100ml to 89.38mg per 100ml at 27°C.The water solubility achieved by complexation with β-cyclodextrin,
although significant, is not considered sufficient to permit formulation of
ibuprofen as a soluble dosage form for oral administration in liquid form 
wherein ibuprofen is present at a therapeutic dosage level (100-600mg) in
a suitable volume of water (120-250ml).European patent publication 274 444 (Bristol Myers) describes the
preparation of ibuprofen-cyclodextrin complexes using α-cyclodextrin, γ-cyclodextrin
or a methylated β-cyclodextrin in place of β-cyclodextrin. The
water solubility of the ibuprofen-cyclodextrin complex is further enhanced
to levels of practical utility using these forms of cyclodextrin, but the high
cost of these materials, reflected in the cost of medicinal products
containing them, is unlikely to promote their widespread use in analgesic
products, more particularly in

<CLAIMS>
The use of an ibuprofen-β-cyclodextrin complex that remains homogeneous
and stable in water up to a temperature of 100°C for the manufacture of a

medicament for oral consumption.
Use as claimed in claim 1 wherein the ibuprofen-β-cyclodextrin complex
delivers a therapeutic dosage level of 100 to 600mg ibuprofen in solution as a single

dosage unit.
