<ABSTRACT>
A set of shop scales (1) with electronic price calculation for goods which can be operated optionally by a customer or by sales staff in a shop comprises a computing device, a display device (4), an input and call device (6), a call store (14) for data on products and an electronic logic circuit (13) between the input and call device (6) and the call store (14). The display device is a screen (5). The input and call device (6) is arranged on or integrated into the screen (5). Images of the goods (42) and/or goods-related alphanumeric indications (43, 44) can be displayed on the screen (5) which can be called by actuating the input and call device (6) from the call store (14).

<CLAIMS>
An electronically price-calculating shop scales for goods 
for optional operation by a customer or by a sales person 

in a shop having an arithmetic unit, a screen (5) as a 
display device, an input and fetching device associated 

with the screen, a fetching memory for goods-related data 
and a logic electronic circuit between the input and 

fetching device and the fetching memory, whereby images 
of the goods and/or goods-related alphanumeric 

designations can be represented on the screen, which can 
be fetched from the fetching memory by operating the 

input and fetching device,
characterised in that
 the pictures (42) of the goods 
and/or goods-related alphanumeric designations can be 

displayed on the screen (5) in individual key areas (41), 
for which the size, number and arrangement varies, and 

the input and fetching device (6) is constructed as a 
device disposed in front of the screen (5) and 

conditioned by radiation, i.e. as an ultrasound or an 
infrared device in which a switching function can be 

triggered by disturbing or respectively interrupting the 
radiation. 
Scales according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 a control keypad (51) which is a 
combination of an alphanumeric and a numeric keypad for 

operation by a sales person can be represented on the 
screen (5) apart from the pictures of goods (42) and 

weight-related, goods-related sales data (33, 44, 46). 
Scales according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the screen (5) only serves to 
display pictures of goods (42) and in each case a  

 
conventional separate display device (72) for weight-related, 

goods-related sales data (46) and also an 
additional, separate, conventional control keypad (63) 

are provided. 
Scales according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 serial numbering of pictures of 
goods (42) of different sizes with numbers (44) can be 

performed by means of a programming command. 
Scales according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the screen (5) can be used for 
advertising representations (91). 
Scales according to Claim 1,
characterised in that,
 at the screen, control areas (31, 
32, 33) of the input and fetching device (6) correspond 

with respect to size and position to display sections (A, 
B, Z) which can be selected at random and have the 

respective pictures of goods (42) so that, when the 
respective control areas (31, 32, 33) are actuated in the 

region of the associated picture of goods (42), only the 
data belonging to this picture can be fetched and/or the 

corresponding functions can be triggered. 
Scales according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the screen (5) only serves to 
display weight-related and other goods-related sales data 

(43, 44, 45, 46) in conjunction with pictures of goods 
(42) and at said screen an additional separate 

conventional control keypad is provided. 
Scales according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 a logic, electronic circuit is 
provided, in which by selecting an image of a group of 

goods (81) inside a first plane (82) of the screen (5) 
one can switch to at least one further plane (83), in  

 
which the pictures of the goods (42) of the respective 

group of goods (81) and also, where appropriate, further 
data can be represented. 
Scales according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 pictures of goods (42) and other 
alphanumeric data on the goods, in particular goods' 

designations (43), serial numbers (44), weight-related 
and goods-related sales data (46) and operating 

instructions (84) can be transmitted to any other scales 
from an overriding, central electronic data processing 

device (18) outside the scales or from other scales via 
a scales connec
tion (19).
