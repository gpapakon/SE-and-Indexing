<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile apparatus uses a single memory in a 
facsimile system and a printer system without using an 

interface between both systems. In the facsimile 
apparatus, a FAX controller stores data received via a 

communication line. Recording control circuit fetches 
data from the memory via a data bus, and records an 

image based on the fetched data. The memory intervene 
circuit outputs a data bus selection signal, and 

switches an address of access to the recording medium 
and a connection of the data bus. Thus, a single memory 

is shared in a facsimile system and printer system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image 
communication method and apparatus. Fig. 10 is a block diagram illustrating the 
construction of a general facsimile apparatus having an 
ink-jet printer as a recording apparatus. In Fig. 10, numeral 200a is a facsimile controller 
system, and numeral 200b is an ink-jet printer system. 
In this facsimile apparatus, data transmitted from the 
facsimile controller system 200a is received by the ink-jet 
printer system 200b, and the image data for 
recording included in the received data is printed on a 
recording medium. Numeral 200 is a facsimile controller (FAX 
controller) which performs reading of an original image, 
transmission/reception control to a telephone 
communication line, and data transmission and recording 
instructions to an ink-jet printer system 200b. Numeral 
201 is a memory for the facsimile controller system 
which stores read data of an original or reception data 
received from the telephone communication line. That 
is, the FAX controller 200 performs the operation 
instruction to an ink-jet printer system 200b via a 
serial interface 202, and supervises the state of the  
 
ink-jet printer system 200b such as an error caused by 
out-of-paper. Numeral 203 is an interface circuit for printer 
data (printer interface), and transmits a control code 
and image data to execute recording with respect to the 
ink-jet printer system 200b. As an example of the 
printer interface 203, there is a CENTRONICS interface 
which is generally by a printer controller. The construction of the ink-jet printer system 200b 
is described below. In Fig. 10, numeral 210 is a printer CPU which 
performs various controls in the ink-jet printer system 
200b. Numeral 211 is a memory for the ink-jet printer 
system 200b which stores data received from a facsimile 
controller system 200a. Numeral 212 is a serial 
interface which receives the operation instruction 
transmitted from the facsimile controller system 200a. 
Furthermore, the serial interface 212 transmits the 
facsimile controller system 200a from the instruction of 
the ink-jet printer system 200b. Numeral 213 is an interface circuit for print data 
(printer interface) which receives a control code and 
image data transmitted from the facsimile controller 
system 200a. Numeral 214 is a register block capable of 
reading and writing. The Printer CPU 210 writes the 
received image data into the register block 214, and  
 
converts the written image data to correspond to the 
recording form of a printer head
