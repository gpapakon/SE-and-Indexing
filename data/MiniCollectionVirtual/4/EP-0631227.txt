<ABSTRACT>
The subject-matter of the application relates to a method in which only values (FA(s)) of a fuzzy set union, which represents the distribution of possible distinct (unfuzzy) output values, within a minimum and a maximum scanning value (smin and smax) are determined and forwarded to a defuzzification circuit for the purpose of further processing. The advantage which is achieved with the subject-matter of the application resides in the fact that a very fast inference formation is possible, in particular in extreme situations where a processing time which is as short as possible is required.

Method for fast inference formation in a fuzzy
inference processor,


in which, in a first step, the numbers (ro) of the
linguistic values of the output variables of all the

rules are used to determine a maximum number (lwmax)
for a linguistic value of the output variables and a

minimum number (lwmin) for a linguistic value of the
output variables,
in which, in a second step, the minimum number (lwmin)
for a linguistic value of the output variables and the

maximum number (lwmax) for a linguistic value of the
output variables are used for relative addressing of a

memory which contains an initial value (na) for each
number of a linguistic value of the output variables

and a final value (ne) of the association function of
the respective linguistic values of the output

variables, and a minimum latching value (smin) is
formed from the initial value (na(lwmin)) addressed by

the minimum number of the linguistic value of the
output variables, and a maximum latching value (smax)

is formed from the final value (ne(lwmax)) addressed by
the maximum number of a linguistic value of the output

variables, and
in which, in a third step, only association function
values of a combination set (FA(s)) are determined from

weighted association functions of the linguistic values
of the output variables within an interval between the 

minimum and the maximum latching value (smin, smax) and
are passed on to a defuzzification circuit for further

processing.
Method according to Claim 1,

in which, in the first step, the maximum number (lwmax)
for a linguistic value of the output variables is

determined in that, for all the rules, a respective
maximum is in each case formed sequentially from a

number (ro) of the linguistic value of the output
variables and a number from a first register (REG1),

and the respective maximum is transferred to the first
register, provided a weighting factor (g) for the

association function of the respective linguistic value
of the output variables is not zero and the condition

part of the respective rule is satisfied (hit = 1), and
in that, having taken into account the last rule, the maximum

number (lwmax) for the linguistic value of the output
variables is tapped off at the output of the first

register (REG1), and
in which, in the first step, the minimum number (lwmin)
for a linguistic value of the output variables is

determined in that, for all the rules, a respective
minimum is in each case formed sequentially from a

number (ro) of the linguistic value of the output
variables and a number from a second register (REG2),

and the respective minimum is transferred to the second
register, provided the weighting factor (g) for the

association function of the respective linguistic value
of the output variables is not zero and the condition

part of the respective rule is satisfied (hit = 1), and
in that, having taken into account the last rule, the minimum

number (lwmin) for a linguistic value of the output
variables is tapped off at the output of the second

register (REG2).
Method for fast inference formation in a fuzzy
logic processor in which, in a first step, the numbers

(ro) and the linguistic values of the output variables
of all the rules are used to determine a maximum number 

(lwmax) for a linguistic value of the output variables
and a minimum number (lwmin) for a linguistic value of

the output variable,

in which, in a second step, the maximum number (lwmax)
is used for addressing within a memory word which is

located in a memory and in each case contains a
quadrant number (qnr) for each linguistic value of the

output variables, and the quadrant numbers form the two
most significant bits of a maximum latch
ing value (sb),
whose other bits consist of logic ones,
in which, in a third step, starting from the maximum
latching value (sb), the latching value (s) is reduced

until the association function value of the linguistic
value of the output variables with the minimum number

(lwmin) is equal to zero and the latching value (s)
assumes the minimum latching value (smin), and
in which, in a fourth step, only association function
values of a combination set (FA(s)) are determined from

the weighted linguistic values of the output variables
within an interval between the minimum and the maximum

latching value (smin, sb), and are passed on to a
defuzzification circuit for further processing.
Method according to Claim 3,

in which, in the first step, the maximum number (lwmax)
for a linguistic value of the output variables is

determined in that, for all the rules, a respective
maximum is in each case formed sequentially from a

number (ro) of the linguistic value of the output
variables and a number from a first register (REG1),

and the respective maximum is transferred to the first
register, provided a weighting factor (g) for the

association function of the respective linguistic value
of the output variables is not zero and the condition

part of the respective rule is satisfied (hit = 1), and
in that, having taken into account the last rule, the maximum

number (lwmax) for the linguistic value of the output
variables is tapped off at the output of the first

register (REG1), and 
in which, in the first step, the minimum number (lwmin)
for a linguistic value of the output variables is

determined in that, for all the rules, a respective
minimum is in each case formed sequentially from a

number (ro) of the linguistic value of the output
variables and a number from a register (REG2), and the

respective minimum is transferred to the second
register, provided the weighting factor (g) for the

association function of the respective linguistic value
of the output variables is not zero and the condition

part of the respective rule is satisfied (hit = 1), and
in that, having taken into account the last rule, the minimum

number (lwmin) for a linguistic value of the output
variables is tapped off at the output of the second

register (REG2).
Method according to Claim 3 or 4,

in which a memory for association functions of the
linguistic values of the output variables is organized

such that, for a specific latching value (s) of a
maximum of two possible numbers for relevant linguistic

values of the output variables, the lowest possible
number is always produced for a relevant linguistic

value of the output variables,
in which, in the third step, starting from the maximum
latching value (sb), the latching value (s) is reduced

as long as the number (no) of the linguistic value of
the output variables is greater than or equal to the

minimum number (lwmin) of a linguistic value of the
output variables and then, after a change to a next-lower

minimum number (lwmin-1) for a linguist value of
the output variables, the latching is continued until

an association function value (mo1), which is
associated with a number (no1) (increased by one) of

the linguistic value of the output variables, of the
linguistic value of the output variables is equal to

zero or, after another change to a next-but-one lower
minimum number (lwmin-2) for a linguistic value of the

output variables, the number (no1) (increased by one) 
of the linguistic value of the output variables is less

than the minimum number (lwmin) of a linguistic value
of the output variables, in which case the minimum

latching value smin occurs at the end of the latching.
