<ABSTRACT>
The process comprises at least a first phase for separatÂ­
ing a plurality of particles of molten steel from a bath of 

molten steel, a second phase for subjecting these particles, 
whilst still in the fluid state, to a first system of forces acting 

on the outer surface of each of the said particles and to a 
second system of forces acting on each element of the body 

of each particle, the said two systems of forces being chosen 
in such a way that these forces tend to impart a substantially 

spherical form to each of the said particles, and a third phase 
for removing heat from the said particles sufficient to bring 

them substantially to the solid state.
