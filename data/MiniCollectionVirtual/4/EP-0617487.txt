<ABSTRACT>
A plug connecting device, especially for a mobile telephone, has a cable plug (2) and an apparatus plug (1). The cable plug (2) is provided with a web (9) which engages in a housing receptacle (12) in the apparatus plug (1) when the two plugs (1 and 2) are joined together. A contact receptacle (14) in the form of a sleeve is connected to the web (9) and, in particular, is produced integrally. It is used for the connection of a coaxial cable (7a). Located on the apparatus plug (1) in a corresponding assignment is a contact receptacle (13), in the form of a sleeve, for a coax contact (6) on a coaxial cable (7). Thus, when the plugs (2) are joined together, not only are the contact elements (4) of the apparatus plug (1) and the contact elements (8) of the cable plug (2) electrically connected to one another, but the two coax contacts (6 and 11) and thus the coaxial cables (7 and 7a) as well. In addition, the contact receptacles (13 and 14) which are in the form of sleeves and are in each case integrally formed on the housing carry out a centring function which ensures that the plugs (1 and 2) are joined together more easily and securely.

A plug connection device comprising a first connector 
(1), in particular an appliance connector, and a second 

connector (2), in particular a cable connector, for example 
for a mobile telephone, wherein the first connector (1) 

comprises contact elements (4) which are arranged in rows 
and which on the one hand can be electricaly conductively 

connected to electric conductors (24) of an appliance or 
cable and on the other hand in each case to a contact 

element (8) of the second connector (2), wherein an 
electrically insulating housing (5, 10) of the first 

connector (1, 2) can be plugged into an electrically 
insulating housing (10, 5) of the other connector (2, 1) and 

wherein the receiving housing comprises a central rib (9) 
which engages into a housing receiver (12) of the plugged-in 

housing and on which the contact elements of the receiving 
housing are arranged, characterised in that in each 

connector housing (5, 10) there is provided at least one 
coaxial contact (6, 11) which can be inserted into a sleeve-like 

contact receiver (13, 14) of its connector housing (5, 
10) and can be held therein by locking action, snap action 

or clamping action and that the sleeve-like contact receiver 
(13, 14) is arranged on the central rib (9), in particular 

is integrally moulded thereto, and that its outer diameter 
exceeds the thickness of the rib (9) so that the two 

connectors (1, 2) can be plugged together only in one single 
geometric assignment. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that 
the contact elements (4) of a connector (1) are arranged as 

groups in two rows, wherein their free ends, which can be 
connected to the electric conductors (24) of an appliance, 

lie in a common plane, or that the contact elements (4) of 
the connector (1) are arranged as groups in two rows, 

wherein the free ends, which can be connected to the  
 

electric conductors (24) of the appliance, are arranged in 
two parallel planes, the distance between which corresponds 

approximately to the thickness of a first circuit board 
(23). 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that 
the free ends of the contact elements (4), which lie in a 

common plane, can be applied to a circuit board (23), 
wherein the contact elements (4) are connected to the 

electric conductors (24), in particular the so-called pads, 
of the first circuit board (23) in accordance with so-called 

SMD technology. 
A device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that a 
first circuit board (23) is provided on both sides with so-called 

pads and it engages between the free ends of the 
groups of contact elements, wherein the contact elements (4) 

of said groups are connected to the electric conductors 
(24), in particular to the so-called pads, of the first 

circuit board (23) in accordance with so-called SMD 
technology. 
A device as claimed in at least one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the ends (29) of the contact elements 

(8) of the connector (2) which face away from a mating 
connector (1) and project beyond the housing (10) are bent 

over towards the outer surface (30, 31) of the housing (10) 
and form a SMD connection with a second circuit board (32). 
A device as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that 
the coaxial contact (11) of the connector (2) can also be 

electrically conductively connected to the second circuit 
board (32) via SMD technology.

that the connector (2) and the second circuit board (32) can  

 
be mechanically coupled via preferably two pins (34), 

wherein in particular the two pins (34) are arranged on the 
connector (2) and the two receivers (35) therefor are 

arranged on the second circuit board (32). 
A device as claimed in Claim 7, characterised in that 
the mechanical pins (34) are retained by snap action, 

locking action, impression or hot stamping. 
A device as claimed in at least one of Claims 5 to 8,
