<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photosensitive
material processing apparatus, and more particularly relates
to an automatic developing apparatus for developing silver
halide photosensitive material. Specifically, the present
invention relates to an improvement in a processing agent
supply mechanism provided in an automatic developing
apparatus. In other words, the present invention relates to a
compact automatic developing apparatus in which dissolution
work is avoided so that the workability can be greatly
improved and further excellent photographic characteristics
can be stably provided.After silver halide material has been exposed to light,
it is subjected to the processing of development, desilvering,
washing and stabilization. Usually, this processing is
conducted by an automatic developing apparatus. In this case,
a replenishment type developing apparatus is generally
adopted, in which a replenisher is fed into the automatic 
developing apparatus. Due to the foregoing replenishment type
developing apparatus, the degree of activity of the processing
agent in a processing tank can be controlled to be a
predetermined level.In the replenishment type developing apparatus, objects
of the replenishment are to dilute substance that has
dissolved out from photosensitive material, and to replenish
components that have evaporated and consumed. As a result of
replenishment, a large amount of solution overflows and is
discharged out of the developing apparatus.In order to process photosensitive materials on a
commercial base, it is necessary to reduce the cost and labor.
Also, it is necessary to prevent the public pollution.
Further, in order to enhance the commodity value, it is
necessary to use a processing solution, the amount of which is
as small as possible, and it is also necessary that the
processing performance is stable and excellent.In order to meet the demand described above, a method is
disclosed in the official gazette of W092/20013 and in EP-A-537 788, by which
almost all processing agent components are solidified and
directly charged into a processing tank.However, this method is disadvantageous in that a
moisture proof measure can not be appropriately taken.
Further, powder generated from the solidified processing agent
is scattered and mixed in another processing tank, so that the 
photographic performance is deteriorated. Consequently, it is
urgent to develop technology for solving the above problems.In the processing of photosensitive material, the quality
of processing agent must be very
