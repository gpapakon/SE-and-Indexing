<ABSTRACT>
A rock anchor (10) includes an elongate element (14). 
An enlarging means (20) is carried on at least a portion (22) of 

the elongate element (14) for enlarging a transverse 
dimension of said portion of the elongate element. The 

transverse dimension is reducible on the application of 
a suitable force applied to the enlarging means (20). The 

invention extends to a tensioning device (100) for use with 
the rock anchor (10) and to a yielding anchor assembly which 

includes the rock anchor (10) and the tensioning device (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to rock anchors. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a rock anchor, 
a tensioning device for use with a rock anchor and a 
yielding anchor assembly. According to a first aspect of the invention, 
there is provided a rock anchor which includes
 
   an elongate element; and
 
   an enlarging means carried on at least a portion of 
the elongate element for enlarging a transverse 
dimension of said portion of the elongate element, said 
transverse dimension being reducible on the application 
of a suitable force applied to the enlarging means. In use, a tensioning device is arranged 
proximate one end of the elongate element to grip the 
elongate element and to maintain a suitable tension 
within the elongate element. The tensioning device 
defines a passage through which the elongate element 
passes and via which said suitable force is applied to 
the enlarging means. The elongate element may be in the form of a  
 
multi-strand cable. The enlarging means may be in the 
form of a sleeve receivable over a part of one strand of 
the cable to be surrounded by other strands of the cable 
radially to enlarge the cable along said portion. The 
sleeve may be of a suitably malleable metal. The rock anchor may include a stop arranged at 
one end of the elongate element, the stop having a 
transverse dimension which is greater than that of the 
enlarging means, and thus incapable of passing through 
the passage. Hence, once the enlarging means has passed 
through the passage, and the stop abuts against the 
gripping means, further tension imparted to the elongate 
element will cause the elongate element to snap. The 
stop may be swaged onto a free end of the wire rope. According to a second aspect of the invention, 
there is provided a tensioning device for use with a 
rock anchor, the device including
 
   a gripping means for gripping an elongate element 
of the rock anchor, the gripping means defining a 
passage through which the elongate element can pass;
 
   a clamping means for urging the gripping means into 
gripping relationship with the elongate element; and
 
   a tensioning member carried on the clamping means 
for effecting tensioning of the elongate element. It is to be understood that a rock anchor is  
 
often anchored in a borehole by, for example, utilising 
grout or a mechanical shell which is arranged on one end 
of the anchor and a nut which is engageable with a 
threaded portion defined at the other end of the anchor. 
The nut, in this case, will abut against a

<CLAIMS>
A rock anchor which includes 
   an elongate element; and 

   an enlarging means carried on at least a portion of 
the elongate element for enlarging a transverse 

dimension of said portion of the elongate element, said 
transverse dimension being reducible on the application 

of a suitable force applied to the enlarging means. 
The rock anchor as claimed in Claim 1, in 
which the elongate element is in the form of a multi-strand 

cable. 
The rock anchor as claimed in Claim 2, in 
which the enlarging means is in the form of a sleeve 

receivable over a part of one strand of the cable to be 
surrounded by other strands of the cable radially to 

enlarge the cable along said portion. 
The rock anchor as claimed in Claim 3, in 
which the sleeve is of a suitably malleable metal. 
The rock anchor as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, which includes a stop arranged at one 

end of the elongate element, the stop having a 
transverse dimension which is greater than that of the 

 
enlarging means. 
A tensioning device for use with a rock 
anchor, the device including 

   a gripping means for gripping an elongate element 
of the rock anchor, the gripping means defining a 

passage through which the elongate element can pass; 
   a clamping means for urging the gripping means into 

gripping relationship with the elongate element; and 
   a tensioning member carried on the clamping means 

for effecting tensioning of the elongate element. 
The device as claimed in Claim 6, which 
includes an adjustment means for adjusting a transverse 

dimension of said passage. 
The device as claimed in Claim 7, in which the 
gripping means comprises a jaw assembly having a 

plurality of discrete jaws which define a passage 
through which the elongate element passes, in use. 
The device as claimed in Claim 8, in which the 
jaws each have a tapered outer surface so that the jaw 

assembly is substantially frusto-conical. 
The device as claimed in Claim 9, in which the 
clamping means comprises a first element which defines 

a tapered seat which is complementary to the tapered 
 

outer surfaces of the jaws and a second element which is 
arranged on the first element to retain the jaw assembly 

in position once the jaw assembly has been urged into 
abutment with the seat so that the jaws are urged into 

gripping engagement with the elongate element, in use. 
The device as claimed in Claim 10, in which 
the displacing means includes a third element adjustably 

arranged relative to the first element of the clamping 
means. 
The device as claimed in Claim 11, in which 
the adjustment means includes a bearing surface defined 

within the third element, the bearing surface being 
positioned such that, on displacement of the third 

element towards the first element, the surface bears 
against the jaw assembly and displaces the jaw assembly 

toward a larger end of the tapered seat. 
The device as claimed in any one of Claims 10 
to 12, inclusive, in which each jaw has a smooth inner 

surface defined thereon. 
The device as claimed in any one of Claims 10 
to 12, inclusive, in which each jaw has an inner surface 

which is roughened to facilitate non-slip gripping of 
the roof bolt. 
The device as claimed in Claim 13 or Claim 14, 
in which the second element is calibrated so that a user 

can adjust the gripping force of the jaws. 
A yielding anchor assembly which includes 
   a rock anchor as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 

5, inclusive; and 
   a tensioning device for tensioning the elongate 

element, the tensioning device defining a passage 
through which the elongate element slips when said 

suitable tension is exceeded, the passage being 
dimensioned so that when the tension is exceeded, the 

suitable force is applied to the enlarging means to 
reduce the transverse dimension and to permit the 

portion to be drawn through the passage. 
The assembly as claimed in Claim 16, in which 
the tensioning device is as claimed in any one of Claims 

6 to 15, inclusive.
