<ABSTRACT>
A mobile communication system is provided for 
increasing the capacity for personal stations and 

ensuring a radio channel for use with a micro cellular 
system irrespective of environment in which the system is 

installed. In the mobile communication system which 
allows the coexistence of a cellular automobile telephone 

system (1, 2, 3) and a micro cellular system (4, 5), 
communications in the cellular automobile telephone 

systems and the micro cellular systems are performed in a 
digital form, and a personal station (6) accessing to 

each of these systems is connected thereto by using a 
time-division multiplex access mode or a code division 

multiplex access mode. Since the time-division multiplex 
access mode or code division multiplex access mode is 

used, a radio channel at the same frequency can be used 
by a plurality of personal stations (6). Thus, the 

capacity of the system can be increased for personal 
stations (6) without extending a used frequency band.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile 
communication apparatus which allows the coexistence of a 
cellular automobile telephone system and a micro cellular 
system, and more particularly to a mobile communication 
apparatus which provides the systems with an increased 
capacity for personal stations. A mobile communication apparatus which allows 
the coexistence of a cellular automobile telephone system 
and a micro cellular system is disclosed in JP-A-4-200031, 
and its investigation for commercialization is 
still under progress. The mobile communication apparatus now in a 
practical phase employs an analog communication form and 
a frequency division multiplex access mode which assigns 
radio channels at different frequencies to respective 
subscribers requesting a call. As shown in Fig. 1, this apparatus accesses to 
the cellular automobile telephone system when a personal 
station (PS) 16 is transported by a car or the like which 
is running at a high speed, or to the micro cellular 
system when a personal station is carried by a person who 
is moving in a crowded area such as a building, an 
amusement quarter, or the like at a low speed. A system 
to be accessed is manually or automatically switched.  In the cellular automobile telephone system, a 
public switched telephone network (PSTN) 11 is connected 
to a personal station 16 through a mobile telephone 
switching office (MTSO) 12 and a base station (BS) 13 
placed under the command of the mobile telephone 
switching office 12. Generally, a predetermined number 
of radio channels are previously assigned to the base 
station 13, so that the mobile telephone switching office 
12 selects an unused radio channel from the assigned 
radio channels prior to communications to establish a 
communication line between the base station 13 and the 
personal station 16. In the cellular automobile telephone system, a 
service area is divided into small zones corresponding to 
respective base stations. Between base stations 13 which 
are located too remotely to interfere with each other, 
the same frequency is repeatedly used to cover a wider 
area with a high frequency utilization efficiency. On the other hand, in the micro cellular 
system, the public switched telephone network 11 is 
connected to a personal station 16 through a control unit 
(CU) 14 and a fixed station (FS) 15 placed under the 
command of the control unit 14. The control unit 14 
utilizes a cellular scanner (CS) 19 to search for radio 
channels which are being used by neighboring base 
s
