A compressed-air actuated disk brake for utility vehicles
with a caliper (2) which reaches around a brake disk (1)

and on one side of which a brake application device (3) is
arranged which has a pivoting lever (4, 4a) which is

disposed, facing away from said brake disk, in an
essentially semicircular pivot bearing (30) supported with

respect to said caliper (2) so that it can be swiveled
about an axis of rotation (25) extending in parallel to the

plane of said brake disk (1) and, facing said brake disk,
by means of an eccentric (6) rests approximately in the

longitudinal center against a traverse (7) which extends in
parallel to the axis of rotation (25) and which is guided

to be displaceable with respect to said brake disk (1) and,
by way of at least one pressure member (70, 71), acts upon

a brake pad (10) which, on the brake application side, is
disposed in said caliper (2) to be displaceable with

respect to said brake disk (1), with a further bearing (31)
being provided between said eccentric (6) and said traverse

(7) or between said eccentric (6) and said pivoting lever
(4), 
characterized in that
 at least the further one of said
two bearings (31) is constructed as a slide bearing whose

slide surface receiving applied pressure is composed of at
least 70% by volume polyvinylidene fluoride, at least 10%

by volume polytetrafluoroethylene, and for the rest lead,
with the slide surface receiving applied pressure of the

further slide bearing (31) being dimensioned in such a way
that the bearing load is between 200 and 300 N/mm
2
 occurring
at maximum pressurization of the pivoting lever (4, 4a),

with the angle of wrap of the further slide bearing (31)
being not more than 120Â°.
A compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 said slide surface is composed of 80%
by volume polyvinylidene fluoride, 10 % by volume

polytetrafluoroethylene, and 10% by volume lead.
A compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 1
or 2, 
characterized in that
 lubricating bore reliefs are
formed in said slide surface receiving applied pressure of

said slide bearing (31).
A compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of
the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 said slide surface
receiving applied pressure of said slide bearing (31) has a

thickness between 0.05 and 0.1 mm.
A compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of
the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 between said slide 
surface receiving applied pressure of said slide bearing

(31) and a support base layer, a porous intermediate layer
of bronze is arranged which preferably is composed of 9 to

12% tin, at the most 12% lead and the rest copper.
A compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of
the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 said support base
layer of said slide bearing (31) is formed of steel.
A compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of
the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the slide bearing
(31) is operated in the lubricated state.
A compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of
the claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 a cam acting in
parallel to said axis of rotation (25) is provided as said

eccentric, which cam acts eccentrically with respect to
said axis of rotation (25) on said pivoting lever (4, 4a)

and acts on said traverse (7) with the direction of thrust
being directed towards said brake disk (1).
A compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 8,

characterized in that
 said cam is formed by a pivot bearing
device having at least one essentially semi-circular pivot

bearing (31).
