<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for laying a parquet floor in which the traditional wooden joists are replaced by elastic intermediate elements which bear directly on a horizontal base surface. The intermediate elements used are prefabricated flexible strips (1) made of elastic material, especially comprising particles of rubber which have been obtained from recycled tyres and agglomerated by means of an elastomeric binder. The two faces of the strips can be coated with an adhesive layer which is covered by a protective film to be removed before use. The flexible strips (1) are spaced apart from one another on the base surface (15), with application of fresh adhesive as and when appropriate. Electric cables (17) can be passed between the strips and through passages (18) cut in the latter. Fresh adhesive is then applied on the strips (1), and the elements (10, 11) of the parquet floor are then laid, each one resting on at least two strips. These elements do not need to be nailed. This therefore provides a considerable reduction in the duration and cost of the laying work, a comfortable and noiseless parquet floor, as well as the possibility of absorbing the expansions of the parquet floor without any risk of cracking.
