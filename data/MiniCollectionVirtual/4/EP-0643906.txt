<ABSTRACT>
Starting from a harvester at least with cutting, threshing and cleaning devices for the harvesting of a crop which, after processing in the devices, is divided essentially into a crop quantity and a stalk quantity, the object of the invention, to design a harvester in such a way that the process of processing the crop, in particular the subsequent reworking into the soil, is optimized, is achieved in that there is arranged downstream of the devices a treatment device (6) which has at least two treatment elements (rollers (7)) forming a gap region and which treats the stalk quantity guided through the gap region in such a way that the surface structure of the constituents contained in the stalk quantity is treated at least partially in a way which greatly assists the decomposition of the constituents after depositing on the soil or after working into the soil.
