<ABSTRACT>
- Multiple-use machine for the treatment of wine according to the champagne method. The bottles carried by cradles (6) are rotated about a vertical shaft (5) by a carousel (5a), between a loading position and an unloading position, so as to be presented under workstations (15, 11, 12, 13) where they are discharged, partially emptied, dosed and re-levelled with different inclinations.

A method of treating wine by the champagne method for automatic filling, 
disgorging, sediment removal, liqueuring, and topping up, characterized in 

that the bottles are driven in an inclined position around a vertical shaft (5) on 
holders (6) pivotally mounted on a carousel (5a), each holder (6) having a 

wheel (16a) co-operating with a stationary central cam (16), stepwise rotary 
motion of the shaft (5) bringing the bottles in succession into register with 

various workstations (15, 11, 12, 13). 
A machine according to claim 1, characterized in that the bottles (B) are 
held on the supports (6) via their necks engaging in notches (8), the bodies of 

the bottles resting on supports (9) fitted with resilient spacers (10) of height 
that varies as a function of the amount contained in the bottle. 
A machine according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that in the station for 
disgorging, the necks of the bottles are held by a clamp (17) controlled by a 

lever (18) having one end carrying a wheel (20) that comes into contact with a 
stationary cam (26). 
A machine according to any preceding claim, characterized in that a 
capsule-ejection knife (28) is mounted on a support (23, 24) that pivots about 

an axis (25) under drive from a wheel (27) moving over a cam (30) secured to 
a removable duct (15). 
A machine according to any preceding claim, characterized it that it 
includes a tank (14) containing a supply of wine which is used, after sediment 

removal, for cleaning the pipes. 
A machine according to any preceding claim, characterized in that it has an 
extraction duct (15) for receiving the capsules, the plastics plugs, and the ice 

plugs. 
A machine according to claim 6, characterized in that the duct (15) is 
provided with a Venturi suction system. 
A machine according to any preceding claim, characterized in that, on a 
stationary shaft (5), it comprises: a first stationary cam (16) for tilting the  

 
bottles; and a second stationary cam (26) for closing the clamps (17); a third 

stationary cam (30) being secured to the suction duct (15).
