<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a deodorant composition 
comprising a phosphoric diester compound of the 

following formula or a pharmacologically acceptable 
salt thereof as an active deodorant ingredient. 


(wherein R₁ and R₂ are the same or different and each 
represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group). 
The deodorant composition of this invention has a 
potent deodorizing action and yet does not stimulate 

the mucosa of the eye, nose and throat. Therefore, it 
can be used in various industrial and household 

applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a useful deodorant 
composition. More particularly, this invention relates 
to a deodorant composition comprising an ascorbyl 
tocopheryl phosphate compound or a pharmacologically 
acceptable salt thereof. A diversity of deodorants including active 
charcoal and glyoxal are available on the market. 
Meanwhile, it is known that more than hundreds of 
substances can be sources of malodors and these 
substances are roughly classified into nitrogen 
compounds such as ammonia and amines and sulfur 
compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans. The performance rating of a deodorant is made 
according to how many sources of malodor it may deal 
with and how quickly it does so. In addition to these 
criteria, how conveniently it can be used is another 
important criterion. However, there has not been developed a deodorant 
that fully meets with these criteria. Therefore, 
research and development work is in progress for 
finding better deodorants. Under the circumstances the inventors of this 
invention did much research to create a satisfactory 
deodorant. As a consequence, the inventors discovered 
that the active ingredient compound of the deodorant 
composition of this invention has an outstanding  
 
deodorizing action and, based on this finding, did 
further research and perfected this invention. This invention is, therefore, directed to a 
deodorant composition comprising a phosphoric diester 
compound of the following formula (hereinafter referred 
to as the present compound) or a pharmacologically 
acceptable salt thereof as an active deodorant 
ingredient. 
(wherein R₁ and R₂ are the same or different and each 
represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group). The present compound, which is incorporated in the 
deodorant composition of this invention, is a 
phosphoric diester compound which, as can be seen from 
the above chemical formula, consists of an ascorbic 
acid unit and a tocopherol unit as linked together by a 
phosphoric acid unit. The present compound for use in the deodorant 
composition of this invention can be synthesized by the 
processes described in JP Publication H-2-44478 and JP 
Kokai S-62-205091, among others, or any processes  
 
analogous thereto. For this compound, a variety of 
uses such as an anticataract agent, a prophylactic and 
therapeutic agent for climacteric disturbance, a skin 
care cosmetic (JP Publication H-2-44478), etc. are 
already known. However, it has not been reported that the present 
compound has a potent deodorizing action. The
