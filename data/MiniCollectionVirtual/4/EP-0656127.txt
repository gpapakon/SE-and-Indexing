<ABSTRACT>
The down-hole instrument cable (16) includes a hermetically sealed optical fiber (50) surrounded by a protective buffer layer including a protective gel (62) within a protective tube (60). A layer of electrical conductors (66) between an inner insulator (64) and outer insulator layer (68) surrounds the protective tube, and electrically conductive strength member strands (70) surround the outer insulator layer. The cable includes an electrically conductive cable head body (76) electrically connected to the strength member strands, and an electrically conductive contact subassembly (82), through which the optical fiber and electrical conductors extend. The contact subassembly provides a first electrical terminal for connection to the down-hole instrument, the layer of electrical conductors provides a second electrical terminal, and the optical fiber provides an optical signal pathway for the down-hole instrument (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to instrument cables for use in elongated
passages, and more particularly concerns a reduced diameter cable for use in high
pressure environments.There has long been a need to visually examine down-hole conditions of
a well for various reasons. One of the more common uses of down-hole video
is leak detection. The camera system may detect turbulence created by a leak
and may identify different fluids leaking into the well bore. Particulate matter
flowing out through a hole can be detected. Damaged, parted, or collapsed
tubings and casings may also be detected. The severity of scale buildup in down-hole
tubulars, flow control devices, perforations and locking recesses in landing
nipples can be seen and analyzed.Additional uses for video camera systems include the detection of
formation fractures and their orientations. Video logging provides visual images
of the size and extent of such fractures. Down-hole video is also useful in
identifying down-hole fish and can shorten the fishing job. Plugged perforations
can be detected as well as the flow through those perforations while the well is
flowing or while liquids or gases are injected through the perforations. Corrosion
surveys can be performed with down-hole video and real-time viewing with video
images can identify causes for loss of production, such as sand bridges, fluid
invasion, or malfunctioning down-hole flow controls.Down-hole instrument probes can be made extremely small due to the
existence of charge-coupled device imaging systems and other technologies which
can function as a camera in the down-hole instrument. Electrical circuitry inside
such an instrument can also be made small with the use of semi-conductor
devices. The instrument probe containing the remote video camera system and
other electrical equipment is connected to the surface equipment by an umbilical
instrument cable thereby permitting transmission of electrical power to the video 
camera and communication of data from the video camera to the surface
equipment.Many wells are relatively small in diameter, on the order of 4.5 cm (1.75
in). Consequently the instrument probe and its cable designated for use in such
a well are limited in their respective diameters. This can lead to practical
problems when a high pressure well is involved. Such wells are capped to
prevent the uncontrolled escape of high pressure well fluids and, in order to insert
a down-hole video instrument in such a well, the instrument must be forced into
the well through the cap. As
