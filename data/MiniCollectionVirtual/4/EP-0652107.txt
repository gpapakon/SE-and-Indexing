<ABSTRACT>
A parallel thermal ink jet printing device (1) 
is produced by assembling a plurality of modules (5) on a 

frame or base plate (3). Each of the modules is tested 
beforehand both from the electrical point of view and from 

the hydraulic point of view. In order also to allow for 
testing from the hydraulic point of view, each module (5) 

is provided with an associated respective reservoir (16) 
capable of being filled with a certain quantity of ink 

before the said module is assembled with the rest of the 
device (1). The reservoir (16) preferably forms an 

appendix to the module (5) capable of being inserted in a 
corresponding opening (4) formed in the frame (3) of the 

device so as to allow for precise alignment of the ink 
ejection nozzles (2) provided on the various modules (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ink jet printing
devices and more specifically to a parallel printing
device (head) as defined in the pre-characterising part of
claim 1.The vast majority of ink jet printing devices
can be reduced to two basic categories:
devices in which a transducer (typically of
the piezoelectric or similar type) produces a pressure
pulse intended to effect the ejection of at least one drop
of ink from a nozzle, anddevices in which thermal energy is used to
produce a vapour bubble in a channel or chamber filled
with ink so as to effect the ejection of at least one drop
of ink.The present invention has been developed with
particular attention to possible use in a printing device
of this latter type, usually defined as a thermal ink jet
printing device.A detailed description of the basic principles
of operation and of numerous possible structures of
printing devices of this type is provided in the document
US-A-4463 359.Devices of this kind form the subject of rather
intense patent literature, as demonstrated by way of
example by the documents US-A-4 985 710 and US-A-5 160
945, as well as in the other patent documents cited
therein. Thermal ink jet printing devices are usually
grouped in turn in two broad categories, designated
"roofshooter" and "edgeshooter" respectively, as a
function of the particular method for the production of
the ink ejection nozzles. As will be immediately clear to
the person skilled in the art, the detailed description
provided hereinafter by way of example relates to a device
of the "roofshooter" type. It will nevertheless be clear
that the invention is not limited to such a specific
construction, but can be used for the production of
devices with a construction of the "edgeshooter" or other
type.Thermal ink jet printing devices are usually
manufactured using semiconductor wafers and processing
technology typical of the production of integrated and/or
hybrid circuits. This allows, inter alia, for the
production of multiple heating elements (resistors) with
extremely small dimensions with associated relative
control circuits (for excitation of the heating resistors)
and the relative hydraulic system for supplying the ink.This solution is ideal for the production of
printing devices (heads) of small dimensions which can be
associated with a cartridge containing a store of ink and
can be mounted on a carriage which, during use, is moved
transversely with respect to the surface to be printed,
all in accordance with a typical serial printing method.In practice, once the
