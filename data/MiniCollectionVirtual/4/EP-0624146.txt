<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a device for driving the handrail(s) of escalators, moving staircases and similar personnel-transport means. The handrail is driven in the region of at least one handrail wheel designed in such a way that, fitted coaxially with the wheel, is a unit comprising an electric motor and a geared transmission, the geared transmission preferably being epicyclic in design.

<CLAIMS>
Handrail drive for escalators, moving walkways or 
similar people movers that is provided in at least one 

deflection region of the handrail and includes a handrail 
wheel (2) cooperating with a drive region (27), the drive 

being in the form of a motor/gearing combination in which 
the motor is an electric motor (3) and the gearing is a 

multi-stage planetary gear set (6), characterised in that 
the motor/gearing combination is provided coaxially with 

the drive region (27) of the handrail wheel (2), the 
output shaft (21) of the electric motor (3) is toothed 

and is connected to the pinion (10) of the first stage 
(7) of the planetary gea
r set (6), and the planet wheels 
(16, 17, 18), which are guided in planet wheel cages (13, 

14, 15) and cooperate with the pinions (10, 11, 12) of 
the individual stages (7, 8, 9), mesh with a non-rotating 

sun wheel (19, 20) that is in the form of an annulus. 
Handrail drive according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the first stage (7) of the planetary gear set (6) 

is of helical-toothed construction. 
Handrail drive according to claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the stages (8, 9) of the planetary gear 

set (6), which adjoin the first stage (7), are of spurtoothed 
construction. 
Handrail drive according to claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the sun wheel consists of two individual 

wheels (19, 20) that are rigidly connected to one 
another. 
Handrail drive according to claims 1 to 4, characterised  
 

in that the planet wheels (16) of the first 
stage (7) mesh with one individual wheel (19) and the 

planet wheels (17, 18) of the adjoining stages (8, 9) 
mesh with the other individual wheel (20). 
Handrail drive according to claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the individual wheel (19) of the first 

stage (7) is provided with a flange (28) that extends 
radially outwards. 
Handrail drive according to claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the handrail wheel (2) has radially 

outside the sun wheel (19, 20) a sleeve-shaped projection 
(23) that extends axially in the direction of the flange 

(28), which projection overlaps at least the stages (8, 
9) that adjoin the first stage (7). 
Handrail drive according to claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the free end (24) of the projection (23) 

is guided in a circumferential groove (25) in that end 
face of the flange (21) which faces the projection (23), 

so as to form a labyrinth seal. 
Handrail drive according to claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that a bearing (26), especially a roller 

bearing, is provided radially between the individual 
wheel (20) and the projection (23). 
Handrail drive according to claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that the bearing (26) is arranged in the 

region of the third stage (9) of the planetary gear set 
(6) between the individual wheel (20) and the associated 

region of the projection (23). 
Handrail drive according to claims 1 to 10, characterised 
in that the electric motor (3) is fastened to the  

 
radial flange (28) of the individual wheel (19) that 

belongs to the first stage (7) of the planetary gear 
set (6). 
Handrail drive according to claims 1 to 11, characterised 
in that the motor/gearing combination (3, 6) is 

provided in the region of the head of the balustrade. 
Handrail drive according to claims 1 to 12, characterised 
in that the flange (28) is provided with an 

angular bracket (5) for positioning the motor/gearing 
combination (3, 6).
