<ABSTRACT>
A surgical device enabling lamellar cutting of the cornea to be carried out, comprising a ring-shaped base (1) adapted in such a way that it can be applied to and maintained on the eye, a cutting tool comprising a cutting blade accommodated in a support (4) cooperating with the base (1) in order to guide the displacement of the fine edge of the blade on plane that is parallel to the ring and comprising an adaptation element (10) disposed at the front of the blade for the part of the cornea that protrudes inside the ring. The invention is characterized in that the adaptation element is made of a roller (10) that is coupled to a support for the blade around an axis of rotation that is perpendicular to the cut.
