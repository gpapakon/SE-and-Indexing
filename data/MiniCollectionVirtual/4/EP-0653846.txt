<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a signal encoding apparatus and
a signal encoding method to which there is applied such a system
of encoding information such as digital data, etc. to carry out
encoding of input digital data by so called efficient encoding
to transmit and record encoded data, a decoding apparatus and a
decoding method to which there is applied such a system of
decoding information such as digital encoded data, etc. to decode
encoded data to obtained by reproduction or transmission to
provide reproduced signals.Hitherto, there are various efficient encoding techniques
for audio signals or speech signals, etc. For example, there can
be enumerated band division coding (Sub Band Coding (SBC)) which
is non-blocking frequency band division system to divide an audio 
signal, etc. on the time base into signal components in a
plurality of frequency bands every predetermined unit time
without implementing blocking thereto to encode them, so called
transform coding which is the blocking frequency band division
system to divide a signal on the time base into blocks every
predetermined unit time to transform respective signals on the
time base into signals on the frequency base every respective
blocks (spectrum transform processing) to divide signals
transformed in this way into signal components in a plurality of
frequency bands to encode them every respective frequency bands,
and the like. Moreover, there has been also already proposed
efficient coding technique in which the band division coding and
the transform coding described above are combined. In this case,
for example, a signal on the time base is divided into signals
in a plurality of bands by the above-mentioned band division
coding thereafter to spectrum-transform the signals every
respective bands into signals on the frequency base to implement
coding to the spectrum-transformed signals every respective
bands.Here, as filter for band division used in the
above-mentioned band division coding technique, or the
above-mentioned combined efficient coding technique, etc., there
is a filter, e.g., so called QMF, etc. Such a filter is
described in, e.g., 1976 R.E. Crochiere Digital coding of speech
in subbands Bell Syst. Tech. J. Vol. 55, No. 8 1976. Moreover, 
filter division technique of equal bandwidth is described in,
e.g., ICASSP 83, BOSTON Polyphase Quadrature filters - A new
subband coding technique Joseph H. Rothweiler.Further, as the above-described spectrum transform
processing, there is, e.g., such a spectrum transform processing
to divide
