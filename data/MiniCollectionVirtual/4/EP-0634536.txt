<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for connecting the 
hollow vertical and horizontal profiles for civil engineering and 

construction, and to products formed by joining profiles. 
Multiple slits are made into the direction of the axis or 
the circumference near an end of the hollow vertical profile and main 

holes that each accomodate a part of a vertical profile are formed in the 
horizontal profile at intervals of installation of the vertical profiles 

The end of a vertical profile is inserted into a main hole, the vertical 
profile is pressed into the direction of its axis and portions of the 

vertical profile between the slits, are bent outwardly. The portions bent 
outwardly extend to the outside of the vertical profile and into the 

inside of the horizontal profile, and thereby the hollow vertical profile 
and the horizontal profile are fixed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the method for 
connecting hollow vertical and horizontal profiles for the engineering and 
construction works and the products formed by joined profiles. In the invention, the products formed by joined profiles for 
the engineering and construction works refers to a body constructed with 
profiles wherein at least one horizontal profile and at least one vertical 
profile is connected perpendicularly or inclinedly and it may be installed 
at the inside or outside of a building, the circumference of a site for a 
building, park, playground, factory, etc., or along a road, river, etc. 
So, it includes such railings as those of windows, stairs, balconies, 
bridges, etc., such lattices as those of windows, doors, partitions, etc., 
partitions or protections of a ranch, farm, flower-bed, lawn, road, river, 
pond, lake, swamp, etc., or outside fences of a building, hedges, 
barriers, etc.. Japanese patent publication No. sho55-46,250 describes a 
method for connecting a horizontal profile and vertical profile wherein a 
flange is mounted on the outside circumference of a edge of the hollow 
vertical profile and the edge of the vertical profile which is inserted 
into the main hole of a plate of the horizontal profile is expanded and 
opened outwardly by pressing, whereby the plate around the former main 
hole's circumference is constricted between the edge, bent outwardly, of 
the vertical profile and the former flange, whereby the vertical profile 
is fixed to the horizontal profile. However, the pressing of said method requires to prepare a 
mold that fits the shape of a cut side of the vertical profile and to 
insert the mold into the horizontal profile, and thus, manufacturing 
efficiency by said method is low and cost thereof increases. In addition, the method for sticking the vertical and 
horizontal profiles using rivets has also been used. However, in this 
method, the raw materials of a rivet and those of the profiles are 
sometimes different. When re-using the metals of the products formed by 
joined profiles for civil engineering and construction, by melting, it is 
necessary to sort different kinds of metals, resulting in bad work  
 
efficiency and increased cost. Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a 
method for connecting hollow vertical and horizontal profiles of products 
formed by joined profiles for the engineering and construction works and 
the products so obtained, without using any mold that fits the shape of a 
cut side of the
