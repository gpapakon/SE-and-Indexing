<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to
recombinant immunotoxins, and to uses thereof. In
particular, the invention relates to two
immunotoxins, referred to as B3(Fv)-PE40 and B3(Fv)-PE38KDEL,
which may be used in the treatment of
mammalian cancer.The monoclonal antibody B3 (MAb B3) is a
recently isolated murine antibody which is directed
against a carbohydrate antigen in the LE family (Pai
et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:3358-62
(1991)). This antigen is found on the surface of
many mucinous carcinomas of the colon, stomach,
ovaries, breast, lung as well as some epidermal
carcinomas. Because it reacts with only a limited
number of normal tissues, MAb B3 is an ideal
candidate for the treatment and diagnosis of cancer.
In order to create a cytotoxic agent, MAb B3 has
been previously chemically coupled to two different
forms of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) (U.S. patent
4,545,985). One of these is the full length toxin
(PE) and the other a truncated derivative (PE40)
(Kondo at al., J. Biol. Chem. 263:9470-75 (1988) &
Pai at al., supra). Both of these immunotoxins have
been shown to be selectively cytotoxic to tumor 
cells that contain the B3 antigen on their surface,
and these immunotoxins have also been shown to cause
complete tumor regression in mice bearing human
tumor xenografts (Pai et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA 88:3358-62 (1991)). Although these first
generation immunotoxins have properties that
indicate they should be developed further as drugs
for the treatment of cancer, immunotoxins made by
chemical conjugation methods have several
undesirable properties. For example, the chemical
modifications can change the antibody and affect its
binding to the antigen. Furthermore, the purified
immunotoxins are a heterogeneous mixture of
antibody-toxin molecules connected to each other via
different positions on the antibody and the toxin.
Thus, PE can be coupled either to the light- or
heavy-chain of the antibody and to different
positions on each of these chains.The second generation of immunotoxins are
made as recombinant antibody Fv-fusion proteins in
bacteria. It has been shown that single chain
antigen binding proteins (scAB's, scFv's) made from
the Fv portions of the heavy and light chain of
antibodies held together by a polypeptide linker can
have the same binding properties as their full
length two chain counterparts (Bird et al., Science
242:423-26 (1988) and Huston et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-83 (1988)). Furthermore,
fusion proteins composed of scAB's linked to toxins
retain the
