<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to continuous motion can
decorating apparatus in general and relates more
particularly to apparatus of this type in which linear
mandrel speed and spacing between mandrels greatly
exceeds deco chain speed and spacing between pins carried
by the deco chain.Both U.S. Patent No. 3,766,851, issued October
23, 1973 to E. Sirvet et al. for Continuous Can Printer
and Handling Apparatus and United States Patent No.
5,111,742 issued May 12th, 1992
by R. Diponato et al. entitled Mandrel Trip Assembly for
Continuous Motion Can Decorator and assigned to the
assignee of the instant invention, disclose relatively
high-speed so-called continuous motion can decorating
apparatus in which undecorated cylindrical containers
mounted on mandrels that are carried by a rotating
carrier have decorations applied thereto, have a
protective coating of varnish applied over the
decorations, and are then delivered to suction holding
cups on a rotating transfer wheel from which they are
loaded on pins that are carried in a single file
arrangement by a so-called deco chain that is moving in a
closed loop. The chain path extends through an oven
where the pin loaded cans are subjected to heat which 
acts to cure the materials forming the decorations and
their protective coating.For the most part, in prior art apparatus of
this type the mandrels and deco-chain travel generally at
the same linear speed and the spacing between mandrels
generally equals the spacing between deco chain pins.
This type of apparatus has proven to be satisfactory for
equipment that decorates the most popular size beverage
containers now used in the U.S., the twelve ounce
aluminum can having a diameter of 2‚Öù", which apparatus
operates at production rates up to about 2000 cans per
minute. For a given density loading of the deco chain,
as production rates increase this is accompanied by
increased deco chain speed. There comes a point where an
increase in oven size and a longer chain are required if
oven temperature is to be maintained low enough to
prevent excessive heating of the cans. Increasing oven
size and chain length requires a substantial increase in
capital investment, and increasing chain length will also
result in increased maintenance costs and more down time.One prior art approach to possibly solving this
problem is found in U.S. Patent No. 3,469,670 issued
September 30, 1969 to W. J. Cartwright for a Can Transfer
Mechanism. In this Cartwright patent deco chain speed is
much slower than linear mandrel speed and pin spacing is
much

<CLAIMS>
A method for loading cylindrical containers (16) onto a
continuously moving container carrier device (30) from

mandrels (20) on a continuously rotating mandrel carrier
(18) that moves said containers (16) in a single file at a

substantially faster linear speed than the linear speed at
which portions (29a, 29b) of said container carrier device

(30) that are engaged by said containers (16) are moving,
with each of said containers (16) having a closed end and an

open end, and said container carrier device (30) being
downstream of a continuously rotating transfer carrier (27)

; said method including steps of :

delivering said containers (16) from said mandrels (20)
to holding elements (36) on said transfer carrier (27) with

said closed ends operatively engaging said holding elements
(36) by moving said mandrels (20) in single file through a

pickup region (99) and delivering said containers (16) from
said mandrels (20) to said holding elements (36) while the

latter are in said pickup region (99) ;
arranging alternate ones of said holding elements (36)
in a first row and arranging the remaining ones of said

holding elements (36) in a second row when said elements are
carrying said containers (16) through a transfer region (98)

located downstream of said pickup region (99) ; and
removing said containers (16) from said holding
elements (36) while the latter are moving through said

transfer region (98) and delivering said containers to said
container carrier device as said containers are removed from

said holding elements (36) ;

characterized in that said holding elements (36) are moved
in single file through said pickup region (99) at a linear

speed substantially slower than the linear speed of said
mandrels (20), and that in said pickup region (99) spacing

between adjacent ones of said elements (36) is substantialy
less that spacing between adjacent ones of said mandrels

(20).
A method for loading cylindrical containers as set
forth in claim 1 in which said portions of said container

carrier device (30) move through the transfer region (98) at 
a linear speed that is substantially less than the linear

speed of said holding elements (36) as they move through
said pickup region (99).
A method for loading cylindrical containers as set
forth in claim 2 in which spacing between said holding

elements (36) in a given row at said transfer region (98) is
substantially less than twice the spacing between adjacent

ones of said holding elements (36) when the latter are
located in said pickup region (99).
A method for loading cylindrical containers as set
forth in claim 2 in which the containers are driven from the

mandrels (20) to said holding elements by timed application
of pressurized air through the mandrels (20) to the interior

sides of said closed ends, with pressurized air being
introduced to each of said mandrels (20) at its end remote

from the closed end of the container (16) mounted thereon.
A method for loading cylindrical containers as set
forth in claim 4 in which each of said holding devices (36)

is a suction device that includes a container engaging
collapsible bellow (37).
A method for loading cylindrical containers as set
forth in claim 5 in which said containers (16) engage said

bellows (37) before clearing said mandrels (20).
A method for loading cylindrical containers as set
forth in claim 1 wherein arranging comprises rotationally

advancing said holding elements (36) and radially inwardly
guiding said holding elements to reduce their linear speed.
A method for loading cylindrical containers as set
forth in claim 1 wherein arranging comprises camming said

Apparatus for handling cylindrical articles, said
apparatus including :


a carrier (18) mounted for continuous rotation on a
mains axis (19) ;
a plurality of equally angularly spaced mandrels (20)
mounted on said carrier (18) and arranged in an array

surrounding said main axis (19) ;
a transfer carrier (27) mounted for continuous
rotation; 
a plurality of pickup devices (36) mounted on said
transfer carrier (27) in an array surrounding its rotational

mandrels while said pickup devices (36) move through a

pickup zone (99) ;

means for controlling application of
pressurized air to said mandrels (20) while they move

through said pickup zone (99) to drive cylindrical articles
(16) from said mandrels (20) to be received by said pickup

devices (36) while the latter move in single file through
said pickup zone (99);
said apparatus being characterized in that it
