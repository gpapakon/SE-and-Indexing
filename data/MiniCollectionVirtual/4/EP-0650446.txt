<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a threaded plug (10) with an outside diameter of 100 mm or more for large containers, especially large pallet containers with a capacity of, for example, 1000 l, intended for the transport of gassing or outgassing substances. In order to prevent the undesirable formation of internal pressure in the container, there is an aperture (16) with an outgassing device (24) in the middle of the disc-shaped top (12) of the threaded plug (10) which is designed in such a way that it is impossible for a higher vapour pressure than 0.3 bar to form in the gas phase above the fluid content.

A screw top (10) having a disc-shaped upper part (12) and a 
flanged edge (14) adjoining the outer circumference thereof and 

extending at right angles thereto and having an internal thread as 
a closure cap for a large-volume container provided in particular 

for the storage and transportation of gas-emitting and gas-releasing 
fillings, wherein a degassing device (24) is inserted 

centrally into the upper part (12), characterised in that the outer 
diameter of the screw top (10) is at least 100 mm, and a threaded 

opening or bunghole (16) for insertion of a further screw top or 
stopper (20) with a correspondingly smaller diameter is provided 

centrally in the disc-shaped upper part (12) of the screw top (10), 
the additional stopper (20) or the further screw top being provided 

with the degassing device (24). 
A screw top according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
degassing device (24) is formed as a one-way degassing device 

for internal excess-pressure degassing (from the inside to the 
outside). 
A screw top according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
degassing device (24) is in the form of a mushroom-shaped 

plastics insert with a rubber O-ring seal as an excess-pressure safety 
device, opening at the earliest under internal vapour pressure of 

0.25 kPa (0.25 bar), preferably approximately 0.35 kPa to 0.5 kPa,  
 

but at the latest under internal vapour pressure of 0.65 kPa (0.65 
bar). 
A screw top according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
degassing device (24) is formed as a two-way degassing device 

for internal excess-pressure degassing and for preventing vacuum 
formation inside the container. 
A screw top according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, characterised in that 
the degassing device (24) itself is also formed as a threaded 

stopper (32) [sic - 40] of relatively small diameter and is arranged 

centrally in the stopper (20). 
A screw top according to any one of the preceding claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the additional stopper (20) can be covered 

by a sealing cap (26). 
A screw top according to any one of the preceding claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that at least one small bore (30) is formed on its 

outer edge substantially in the transition region between the 
flanged edge (14) and the disc-shaped upper part (12), but below 

a screw-top seal (28) and substantially above the thread. 
A screw top according to any one of the preceding claims 1, 2 or 
5, characterised in that the degassing device is designed in such a 

manner that internal pressure no higher than 0.3 kPa (0.3 bar) can 
build up in the gas phase or in the space above the liquid 

contents.
