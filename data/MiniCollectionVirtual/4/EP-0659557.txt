<CLAIMS>
Device for metering liquid media of differing 
viscosity in offset printing presses, preferably in 

varnishing units, using a counter-impression 
cylinder, a forme cylinder and at least one 

applicator roller, characterised in that arranged 
optionally settable against the forme cylinder (2) 

for metering low viscosity media are two 
exchangeable rollers (3, 4) of differing surface 

hardness as metering roller (3) and dipping roller 
(4) or for metering higher viscosity media, a 

chamber doctor (8) and a rastered applicator roller 
(3') are arranged relative to the forme cylinder 

(2). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the roller (3 or 4) of harder surface hardness has a 

rastered surface. 
Device according to Claim 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the rastered metering roller (3) can be set 

against the forme cylinder (2) or against a dipping 
roller (4) having a softer surface. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
for metering low viscosity media with the object of 

achieving larger layer thicknesses, the metering 
roller (3) with the surface hardness less with 

respect to the dipping roller (4) is arranged 
relative to the forme cylinder (2). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
for metering low viscosity media for achieving 

smaller layer thicknesses, the metering roller (3) 
with surface hardness higher relative to the dipping 

roller (4) is arranged relative to the forme  
 

cylinder. 
Device according to Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that dipping roller (4) and metering roller (3) are 

exchangeable in their bearing positions. 
Device according to Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the device is arranged prior to the first 

printing unit in an offset printing press. 
Device according to Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the device is arranged between the printing 

units in an offset printing press. 
Device according to Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the device is arranged after the printing units 

in an offset printing press. 
Device according to Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that a further treating station is arranged prior to 

or after the device.
