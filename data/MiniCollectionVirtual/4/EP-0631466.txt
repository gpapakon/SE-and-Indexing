<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a cultivating medium for 
plants consisting of bonded mineral wool, in particular rock 
wool, as well as a method for producing such a cultivating 
medium. The invention also concerns the use of a cultivating 
medium for grassing soilless substrates which are extensively 
irrigated, i.e. irrigated by natural precipitation, as 
well as the use of polysaccharide products insoluble in cold 
water for producing hydrophilic mineral wool products having 
an increased water retaining capacity, which are preferably 
suited as a plant cultivating medium for soilless culture. In the production of mineral wool mats, another important 
procedural step beside fiberization proper is the formation 
of the mat. As is known per se, a thermosetting resinous 
binding agent, in particular one on the basis of phenolic 
resin which later on sets under the influence of temperature 
and renders the mineral wool products dimensionally stable, 
is herefor sprayed onto the obtained mineral fibers subsequent 
to the fiberizing process. Concurrently with this 
fiberizing process, a fiber-gas-air mixture is produced and 
is introduced into a box-shaped vertical conduit in order to 
separate the fibers. The conduit comprises at its bottom 
side a gas-permeable, moving endless conveyor or production 
belt whereon the mineral wool mat, or rock wool mat, forms. 
An evacuation system producing a defined vacuum is located 
underneath the production belt.  
 When the fiber-gas-air mixture containing the binding agent 
contacts the production belt, the gas-air mixture provided 
with binding agent particles is evacuated from underneath 
the production belt, and the fibers deposit on the latter in 
form of a wool mat. The mineral wool mat bonded by a thermosetting resinous 
binder which is obtained in said production shows excellent 
hydrophobic properties - beside an advantageous mechanical 
strength - due to subsequent curing at a temperature in excess 
of 200Â°C and further polymerization. Such hydrophobizing 
is particularly desirable in the case of articles 
of bonded mineral wool which are utilized for thermal and 
sound insulation in construction industry, as high demands 
must be put to the mechanical strength as well as to the 
water resistivity of these products. If, however, bonded mineral wool articles having particular 
shapes are to be used e.g. as a cultivating medium for 
cultivating plants in soilless culture, then it is necessary 
for the respective mineral wool or rock wool cultivating 
medium
