<ABSTRACT>
The new disposable hypodermic syringe (1) has the composite plunger rod formed by two 
separate parts (2a, 2b) linked to each other by means of a connecting link (5a, 5b), with a cross-sectional 

articulation point, said link being made of appropriate material, and presenting a cross-sectional 
perpendicular slot (7) of selected depth and amplitude, said perpendicular slot forming a 

flexible connecting membrane and acting as a hinge which brakes due to fatigue. On the facing 
surfaces of the butt ends (3a, 3b) which are spaced apart in a rest position, there are provided 

projecting crimping means (8, 9) aligned with respect to each other, and any rotation imparted to one 
of said means is followed by the other means, seaming which disappears when, upon a subsequent 

traction, the two discs are spaced apart, yet maintained linked by means of the intermediate part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present patent is a new hypodermic 
syringe of the single-use type. Single-use hypodermic syringe are known, which in order 
to complete use thereof, the user of the syringe has to exert 
a traction or contraction force such that by breaking the 
safety device, the entire phase of single-use application can 
be completed, by releasing the locking by means of deliberate 
excess pressure, thus destroying the aforementioned safety 
device, and by this means rendering re-use of the syringe 
impossible. It is thus understood that rendering the syringe unusable 
is a result of the action of its user, by deliberately 
destroying the locking of the piston by means of excess 
pressure. These known syringes were developed owing to the need to 
prevent serious and non-serious contagious illnesses which are 
frequently transmitted by re-use of a syringe already used by 
another person. Thus, pathological infectious germs wich can be contained 
in the bloodstream of one person are tranferred to the 
syringe, and despite regular, commonplace disinfection, they 
can remain inside the syringe and pass into the vein of the  
 
following person, who is thus inoculated with the virus of 
AIDS, hepatitis and other illnesses. There are various different single-use syringes of this 
type registered, such as those according to Spanish utility 
models 9100817 and 8801915, and US Patent No. 91US-714431, in 
all of which the safety device is broken by deliberate excess 
pressure exerted by the user of the syringe. In short, all known models of single-use type syringes 
are rendered useless for further service by means of locking, 
which, in order to be released, must be deliberately destroyed 
by excess pressure applied to the syringe. This additional pressure is only exerted at the wish of 
the user, who must take deliberate action, since normally, all 
manoeuvres in order to carry out any operation take place 
instinctively, with the least possible force. Consequently, breakage by means of deliberate excess 
pressure on the plunger at the end of its descending path does 
not take place automatically, but owing to effort by the user. In order to prevent the breakage of the parts of the 
syringe from necessitating effort by the user, patent US-A-4 
863 427 was produced, the four separate structural embodiments 
of which involve simply preventing a syringe from being re-used. 
No account is taken of the beneficial effect of bubbling  
 
of the fluid when it is mixed with the blood inside the body 
of the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
New, single-use hypodermic syringe of the type in 
which the safety device is destroyed during use, at the moment 

when the piston stroke takes place, owing to deliberate excess 
pressure by the user, with a tension member which connects the 

two co-axial parts which form the plunger, and a transverse 
line of outright breakage at the begining of the descent of 

the plunger when the patient is injected, characterised in 
that transversely, in the manner of a hinge, there is provided 

an articulation vertex, the material of the tension member-hinge 
being suitable for each section to be maintained erect 

during use, and for the transverse articulation vertex to 
maintain its amplitude and depth, whilst acting as a hinge, in 

accordance with the type of material and piston strokes 
previously calculated as necessary in order to withstand 

gradual destruction during bubbling, such as to resist the 
plunger during a single use, and which, by means of its 

opening and closing flexure, moves one piston away from or 
towards the other, and additionally becomes fatigued, such 

that destruction of the tension member-hinge is gradual and 
progresssive, and thus destruction of the syringe is gradual, 

since the material of the membrane cedes gradually and 
progressively by fatigue, until the two sections of the 

tension member-hinge separate. 
New, single-use hypodermic syringe according to the 
preceding Claim, in which in the opposite surfaces of the two 

ends which are separated in the rest position, there are 
disposed three opposite lugs, two in one end and a third in 

the opposite end, which project, and connect in line with one 
another, and when the composite plunger is at the limit of its 

descending path, these three lugs engage with one another in 
an anti-rotatory manner.
