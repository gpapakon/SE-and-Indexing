<ABSTRACT>
A bank note (23) which has passed in a deformed state through a bending unit (28) provided between a bank 
note discriminating unit (24) and a stacker (25) restores thereafter its initial planar shape owing to its own resiliency 

to form surface portions crossing block edges (31). Even when a lift thread fixed to the bank note (23) is drawn after 
the bank note (23) has passed through the bending unit (28), it becomes impossible that the bank note (23) returns to 

a bank note transfer passage (27), so that the stealing of the bank note is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a bill handling apparatus,
and more particularly, to a bill handling apparatus to prevent unauthorized
extraction of bills which have been received in a stacker of the apparatus.For example, Japanese Utility Model Disclosure 63-89181 discloses a
bill-extraction-proof device in a bill validator. As shown in Figs. 18 and
19, in the bill-extraction-proof device, a bill is inserted from an inlet 7
into the space between a pair of side walls 2 and 3 of a frame 1, and is then
carried by belts 11 and rollers 12 to further pass through the space between
slant protrusions 9 and 10 formed on the frame 1 and a plate 5. Although
the bill is slightly deformed when the bill passes through the slant protrusions
9 and 10, the deformation does not provide any obstacle in carrying the
bill. If a person tries to withdraw the bill without authorization from the
inlet 7 by pulling a string such as a fishing line connected to the bill after
it passes through an outlet 8, the extraction is prevented due to engagement
of the bill with the slant protrusions 9 and 10.Disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Disclosure 4-36677 is another bill-extraction-proof
device in which a stopper is rotatably provided to extend
into the passageway of a bill validator and is rotated away from the passageway
according to a control signal generated by the bill validator. This
bill-extraction-proof device is advantageous in that extraction of bill is
effectively prevented since the stopper is rotated away from the passageway
only when a valid bill passes through the validator.However, the bill-extraction-proof device shown in Figs. 18 and 19 is
disadvantageous in that the slant protrusions 9 and 10 can not have their long 
extension length which may obstruct transportation of the bill by belts 11 due to engagement of
the bill and long slant protrusions. Therefore, unauthorized extraction of the bill can be carried
out by stongly pulling a fishing line connected to the bill or by pulling the line after inserting a
thin flexible plate into the passageway.Also, Japanese Utility Model Disclosure 4-36677 demonstrates an extraction-proof
device in which, however, unauthorized extraction may be made by successively inserting two
bills.US-A-4662626 describes a paper document picket for securing and stacking sorted
documents from a high speed reader sorter. The device receives documents through a cupping
assembly designed to bend a document being conveyed into the stacker with the document
arriving from a

<CLAIMS>
A bill handling apparatus comprising a casing (21) provided with an inlet (22);
validator means (24) for judging authenticity of a bill (23) inserted from said inlet (22)

of said casing (21); stacker means (25) for accumulating the bill (23) considered
authentic by said validator means (24); conveyor means (26) for transporting the bill

(23) inserted from the inlet (22) of said casing (21) through said validator means (24) to
said stacker means (25); and bending means (28) provided between said validator

means (24) and said stacker means (25) for gradually bending the bill (23) transported
from said validator means (24) by said conveyor means (26); wherein the bill (23) is

transported along a passageway (27) defined between a guide plate (32) and a support
plate (16) spaced from said guide plate (32); and 
characterised in that
 said bending
means (28) comprises:-


at least a pair of guide portions (29) integrally formed with said guide plate (32) in
both sides of said conveyor means (26), each guide portion (29) extending downward

from said guide plate (32) below a bottom surface (16b) of the support plate (16)
wherein said guide portions (29) have slant surfaces (30) for guiding side edges of the

bill (23) toward a height different from the central portion of the bill (23), and wherein
blocking edges (31) are for
med at the rear end of said guide portions (29) and extend
to a position different from the passageway (27);
said conveyor means (26) arranged to transport the bill (23) over said guide portions
(29) so that both sides of said bill (23) are deformed below the bottom surface (16b) of

the support plate (16).
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said side edges of the bill (23)
are in parallel to a longitudinal centre line of the bill (23). 
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the bill (23) recovers the
initial flat shape due to its own elasticity to form a face intersecting said blocking edges

after passing through said guide portions (29) in its deformed shape.
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein at least a notch (30a) is
formed in each slant surface (30) of said guide portions (29).
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 4 in which at least a notch
is formed in each blocking edge (32) of said guide portions (29).
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein a
plurality of pairs of said guide portions (29) are formed into a stepped shape at both

side portions of said conveyor means (26).
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
bending angle of the bill (23) is in a range of 30 through 170 degrees.
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
bending angle of the bill (23) is in a range of 90 through 150 degrees.
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said
bending means (28) bends the bill (23) into a curved state with a small radius without

any crease.
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, further
comprising central guide means (39) which has a belt (42) and pulleys (35) for guiding

the bill (23).
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the bill
(23) carried by said validator means (24) falls in said stacker means (25) due to its own

weight. 
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein a lever

passes through said guide portions (29).
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein a
plurality of pairs of said guide portions (29) of different heights are formed in both

sides of said guide plate (32).
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 10 to 13 wherein a plurality
of said guide portions (29) are formed in longitudinally shifted positions.
A bill handling apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein said
