<ABSTRACT>
An encoder comprising a television camera (12) which images an object and generates corresponding signals; plural microphones 
(11L and 11R) which are apart from each other to collect sound waves of voice of the object imaged by the television camera 

and output voice signals; presuming circuit (13) which presumes the position of the sound source based on the voice signals 
obtained from the microphones; and an encoding circuit which encodes the image signals in an image area of a given extent 

whose center is in the position of the sound source presumed by the presuming circuit by assigning them codes of an amount 
slightly greater than those assigned to image signals in the other imaging areas so that the resolution of the image of the image 

area of the given extent may be higher than that of the other areas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coding apparatus for
encoding video signals, and more particularly to a moving
picture coding apparatus which specifies a significant
portion in a picture on the basis of the audio
signal sent together with the video signal, increases a
coded bit rate allocated to the specified picture area,
and thereby encodes the picture.With the recent advance in communication
technology, remote conference systems (television conference
systems) and videophone systems available even
for the individual have been put into practical use.In such systems, images and sound are transmitted
using communication channels such as telephone circuits,
which therefore limits the coded bit rate transmittable
per channel. To suppress the amount of picture signal
data to less than the upper limit of the coded bit
rate, the picture information is encoded before
transmission.Since the coded bit rate transmittable per unit
time is insufficient, the coded bit rate for the pictures
per frame to ensure natural movements is determined
by the transmission rate in transmitting moving 
pictures.Generally, coding is effected so that the entire
screen may be uniform in resolution. This, however,
causes the problem of blurring the picture of the other
party's face. Normally, a person does not pay attention
to all over the screen, but tends to concentrate on a
significant portion in the screen. Therefore, with the
picture quality of the significant portion being
improved, even if the remaining portions have a somewhat
low resolution, there is almost no problem in understanding
the picture.Viewed in this light, coding methods have been
studied which display the face area of a person, a more
important source of information, more sharply than the
remaining areas in order to improve the subjective picture
quality. One of such techniques proposed is using
interframe differential pictures (literature: Kamino et
al., "A study of a method of sensing the face area in a
color moving-picture TV telephone," the 1989 Electronic
Information Communication Society's Spring National
Meeting D-92).With this system, the person talking over the telephone
is picked up with a television camera. From the
picture signal thus obtained, moving portions in the
picture are picked up. The face area of the speaker is
estimated on the basis of the picked-up area. A large
coded bit rate is allocated to the estimated face area
and a small coded bit rate is given to the remaining
areas. By performing such a coding process, the
person's face area is
