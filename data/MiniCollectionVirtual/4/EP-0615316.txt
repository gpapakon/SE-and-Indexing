<ABSTRACT>
A brush holder is proposed which is used for mechanical commutation of an electric motor. The brush holder contains a support plate and, fastened thereon, shaft-like guide tubes for sliding brushes pressed by spring action onto a commutator of the electric motor, the pressure spring which is formed as a strip-like leaf spring being coiled at its two end sections in opposite senses, the coils formed in this way being braced against surfaces of limbs which face the commutator, which limbs are arranged on the side walls of the guide tube which are directed transverse to the support plate and the middle section of the prestressed pressure spring loading the end surface of the slide brush which faces away from the commutator. Particularly simple mounting of the brush holder is achieved if the two side walls of the guide tube have recesses which are open edged towards their end facing away from the commutator, the depths of which extend as far as the bracing limbs, if the width of these recesses is larger than the width of the pressure spring and each bracing limb is provided with a slit in the transition to the tube side wall, which slit is open-edged on the side of the bracing limb facing away from the support plate, the depth of which slit corresponds at least to the width of the pressure spring and one longitudinal side of which slit extends into the recess located in its side wall of the guide tube.

Brush holder for mechanically commutated electric 
motors having a mounting plate (12) and shaft-like guide 

casings (16) which are mounted thereon, for sliding 
brushes (18) which are pressed against a. commutator of 

the electric motor by means of spring force, the contact-pressure 
springs (40), which are designed as leaf springs 

in the form of strips, being rolled up in opposite senses 
at their two end sections, the rolls (42) which are 

formed in this way being supported on surfaces, which 
face the commutator, of limbs (52) which are arranged on 

those sidewalls (30) of the guide casings which are 
aligned transversely with respect to the mounting plate, 

and the centre section (44) of the prestressed contact-pressure 
spring loading that end surface of the sliding 

brush (18) which faces away from the commutator, characterized 
in that the two sidewalls (30) of the guide 

casing (16) have cutouts (50), which are open at the edge 
towards their end which faces away from the commutator 

(20), the depth (53) on which cutouts (50) extends as far 
as the supporting limbs (52), in that the width (54) of 

the cutouts (50) is greater than the width (56) of the 
contact-pressure spring (40), and in that each supporting 

limb (52) is provided in the transition to the casing 
sidewall (30) with a slot (58) which is open at the edge 

towards that side of the supporting limbs (52) which 
faces away from the mounting plate (12) and whose depth 

corresponds at least to the width (56) of the contact-pressure 
spring (40), and whose one longitudinal side 

merges into the cutout (50) which is located in the  
 

sidewall (30) of the guide casing (16). 
Brush holder according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the guide casing (16) is provided with bent 

tongues (28) on its rear side (27) facing the mounting 
plate (12). 
Brush holder according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the guide casing (16) has in its 

front side (32) facing away from the mounting plate (12) 
a slot (66) for a braid (26) to pass through, which braid 

is connected to the sliding brush (18) and is connected 
in the main circuit of the electric motor, said slot (66) 

being open at the edge towards that side of the guide 
casing (16) which faces away from the commutator (20). 
Brush holder according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the supporting limbs (52) have a 

length (62) which is greater than the radius of the rolls 
(42), and in that the free end sections of the limbs (42) 

are bent toward the rolls (42).
