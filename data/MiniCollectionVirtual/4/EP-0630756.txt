<ABSTRACT>
An exchangeable tape unit having a tape spool and a 
printing tape wound over the tape spool. The printing tape 

can be prevented from being exposed to light, and the 
exchangeable tape unit being capable of maintaining stabilized 

quality for long duration without color change and 
quality change in a heat sensitive coloring layer formed 

in the printing tape, and being capable of facilitating 
storage. The heat sensitive coloring layer constituting 

the printing tape is positioned radially inwardly when 
winding the tape over a tape spool. Film sheets are 

affixed to upper and lower faces of a resultant tape roll 
of the printing tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exchangeable tape unit to be assembled in a tape cassette and in which a heat sensitive printing tape is wound over a tape spool, and more particularly, to such tape unit in which heat sensitive coloring layer of the heat sensitive printing tape is positioned radially inwardly when winding the tape over the tape spool.Conventionally, a tape cassette used for a tape printer accommodates therein a printing tape on which characters etc. are printed by means of a thermal head etc (See for example DE-A-3 934 491). When the printing tape is used up, a new roll of a printing tape is exchangeable with the used-up roll. Various proposals have been made on such tape cassettes by the applicant. The exchange of the printing tape is generally achieved by exchanging the tape spool and the tape wound thereover as one unit on the tape cassette.Further, in the conventional tape printer, a thermal head is positioned outside of the contour of the tape cassette. The thermal head is generally adapted for printing an image on an image receiving medium such as a paper by selectively heat-driving a plurality of heat generating elements.For printing the image on the tape, the heat generating elements of the thermal head are in contact with the outer side of the printing tape fed from the tape cassette. Accordingly, the heat sensitive coloring layer of the printing tape is generally positioned radially outwardly in an exchangeable roll of the tape wound over the tape spool.However, in the above described conventional exchangeable tape roll, the heat sensitive coloring layer is exposed to outside, since the printing tape is wound over the tape spool in such a manner that the heat sensitive coloring layer is positioned radially outwardly in the resultant roll. Regarding the tape cassette, it provides a window for visually acknowledging a remaining amount of the tape. Thus, light easily enters the interior of the tape cassette through the window. Moreover, various kinds of the printing tapes are prepared in terms of width and color, etc. A user may exchange the tape roll with another kind of the tape roll even if the tape roll has not yet been used up. Thus, the removed tape roll is exposed to light unless it is stored in a dark place.The heat sensitive coloring layer is very likely affected by external light, heat, etc. Accordingly, if the heat sensitive coloring layer of the printing tape is exposed to outside, color change and quality change may occur in the exposed portion of the layer.

<CLAIMS>
A tape cassette (10) comprising:

a tape cassette body (11) having a bottom wall, front (11B) and rear (11A) walls and side walls (11C), a tape spool accommodating portion (42) being defined in a space defined by the walls (11A-11C) and a top open end being defined by the front, rear and side walls (11A-11C),
a cassette lid (12) which covers the top open end of the tape cassette, body (11); and
an exchangeable tape unit (1) placed at the tape spool accommodating portion (42), and including a tape spool (2) and a printing tape (3) wound over the tape spool (2) for providing a tape roll,
wherein
the printing tape (3) comprises a base tape (5), a heat sensitive coloring layer (6) formed on one surface of the base tape (5), and a peelable tape (8) formed on an opposite surface of the base tape (5) through an adhesive agent (7), the heat sensitive coloring layer (6) being positioned radially inwardly in respective tape windings of the tape roll, and
the tape cassette body (11) further comprises a thermal head guide member (17) which defines a recess in which a thermal head (TH) fixed to a cassette installing portion of a tape printer can be positioned such that a plurality of heat generating elements of the thermal head (TH) confront the heat sensitive coloring layer (6), and such that the peelable tape (8) is in contact with a platen roller (40) of the tape printer to nip the printing tape (3) between the thermal head (TH) and the Platen roller (40).
The tape cassette as claimed in claim 1 wherein the front wall of the cassette body is provided with a pair of locking projections to define a locking groove therebetween, and the rear wall of the cassette 25 body is formed with at least one locking hole, and wherein the thermal head guide member is formed with a locking slot.
The tape cassette as claimed in claim 2 wherein the cassette lid is provided with a resilient locking member engageable with the locking groove, at least one locking projection engageable with the at least one locking hole, and a locking piece engageable with the locking slot, the cassette lid being piv- 35 otally movable about the at least one locking hole during assembly and disassembly of the cassette lid to and from the cassette body.
The tape cassette as claimed in any one of claims 1-3 wherein the tape unit (1) has upper and lower faces, and further comprising film sheets (4) affixed to the upper and lower faces through an adhesive agent.
The tape cassette as claimed in any one of claims 1-4, wherein the tape cassette body (11) further comprises a plurality of guides (22, 23, 24, 25) for guiding running movement of the printing tape (3), the plurality of guides (22, 23, 24, 25) being positioned to provide a curved path in which the heat sensitive coloring layer (6) of the printing tape (3) is positioned inwardly of a curve of the curved path.
