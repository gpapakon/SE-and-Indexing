<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of spinal implant systems
of the type which employ spinal rods connected at various locations along the spinal
column by various fixation elements including spinal screws and, more particularly, to
a spinal screw fixation element which provides variable angle adjustability.Several systems have been developed for use in correcting and stabilizing
spinal curves and facilitating spinal fusion. In one system, a bendable rod is
longitudinally disposed adjacent the vertebral column and is fixed to various vertebrae
along the length of the column by way of a number of fixation elements. A variety of
fixation elements can be provided, such as hooks or bone screws, which are
configured to engage specific portions of the vertebra.An example of one such system is the TSRHâ„¢ spinal system of Danek
Medical, Inc. In this system, the hooks or screws are engaged to the spinal rod by
way of eyebolts. As is well known in the art, the eyebolts are received over the spinal
rod and captured within a yoke means formed on the head of the fixation hook or
screw. A nut is threaded onto a threaded post of the eyebolt to clamp the yoke and to
provide a three-point shear clamp force positively locking the hook or screw element
to the spinal fixation rod. Details of the TSRH spinal implant system are disclosed in
the "Surgical Technique Manual" provided by Danek Medical, Inc., published in
1990.It is the goal of the surgeon using such spinal implant 
systems to apply the vertebral fixation elements (hooks
and/or screws) to the spine in the appropriate anatomic
position, and then to engage each fixation element to the
spinal rod. Once the spinal implant system is assembled it
is then possible to correct anatomical deformities and
stabilize the spine. In order to perform this procedure with
a minimum of patient trauma, it is important that the system
used be relatively easy to install. Further, it is highly
desirable that the system permit three dimensional adjustment
of the bone screw fixation elements in order to take
advantage of the most desirable fixation sites in the spinal
column. Ideally, a mechanism providing such adjustment
should be designed in a manner which does not create undue
difficulty in installing the spinal rod or detract from the
overall rigidity of the system.Various mechanisms have been employed in spinal implant
systems to provide a three dimensional adjustment
capability. U. S. Patent No. 4,946,458 to Harms et al.
discloses a pedicle screw provided with a

<CLAIMS>
A variable angle bone screw system for use in a spinal implant system (10) to
connect a vertebral fixation element to a spinal rod (16) extending adjacent the vertebral

column (11) in a patient, comprising:

an eyebolt (26) including a head (26a) defining a passage for receiving said
spinal rod (16) therethrough, said eyebolt (26) further including a threaded stem (31)

receiving a nut (26b), the threaded stem (31) extending from said head (26a) along an
axis perpendicular to and intersecting the axis (A) of said spinal rod (16) ;
a bone screw (20) having a head and a threaded shank adapted to be screw
inserted into a desirable vertebral fixation site;

characterised in that the system further comprises a yoke clamping means (25;
25, 40) for fixing the mounting of said eyebolt (26) to the rod (16); and
an interdigitating locking means (24, 27), associated with said bone screw
(20), for interlocking of said bone screw (20) and said yoke clamping means (25;

25,40) in variable angular orientations and restraining pivoting of the interlocked bone
screw (20) and yoke clamping means (25; 25, 40) relative to the eyebolt (26);
said bone screw (20) and said yoke clamping means (25; 25, 40) being
arranged to be clamped together between the nut (26b) and the eyebolt head (26a) or

between a further nut (43) and a portion of the yoke clamping means (40).
A variable angle bone screw system according to claim 1, wherein the yoke
clamping means (25) comprises a washer having a means (30) for mounting to said

eyebolt (26), said mounting means (30) preventing rotation of said washer (25)
relative to the axis of said eyebolt threaded stem (31), said bone screw head (21) and

said washer (25) defining the interdigitating locking means.
A variable angle bone screw system according to claim 2, wherein said washer
(25) includes a curved recess (28) arranged to contact the spinal rod (16) when the rod

(16) is clamped between said eyebolt head (26a) and said nut (26b). 
A variable angle bone screw system according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said

bone screw head (21) includes a yoke portion (23) defining an opening in which to
receive said eyebolt threaded stem (31) to permit top loading of the eyebolt (26) onto

the bone screw (20).
A variable angle bone screw system according to claim 2, wherein said washer
(25) defines a rectangular shaped opening (30), said opening (30) being sized to

permit said eyebolt head (26a) to be closely received within said opening (30).
A variable angle bone screw system according to any preceding claim,
wherein said threaded shank (22) of the bone screw (20) includes thread configured to

engage the pedical of a vertebra.
A variable angle bone screw system according to claim 1, wherein said yoke
clamping means (25) includes a lateral offset connector (40) which serves to laterally

offset the position of said bone screw (20) relative to said rod (16).
A variable angle bone screw system according to claim 7, wherein said lateral
offset connector (40) includes a pair of laterally extending arms (45).
A variable angle bone screw system according to any preceding claim,
wherein said interdigitating locking means includes a plurality of intermeshing

radially spaced apart splines (24).
