<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a particular class of aromatic compounds,
in particular bis-aromatic α,β-unsaturated ketones, most of which are novel compounds,
for the treatment or prophylaxis of a number of serious conditions caused by
microorganisms or parasites, in particular protozoa such as Leishmania, Plasmodia,
and Coccidia such as Eimeria, and intracellular bacteria, including Legionella and
Mycobacteria. The invention also relates to the novel bis-aromatic α,β-unsaturated
ketones and methods of preparing them, as well as to pharmaceutical and antiparasitic
compositions. Furthermore, the invention also relates to a method for treatment or
prophylaxis of diseases caused by microorganisms or parasites.Parasitic diseases, among these malaria and leishmaniasis, are, on a world basis,
among the most important diseases. The most effective known drugs against the
diseases have many side effects for which reason it is not possible to maintain the
treatment or prophylaxis of specific diseases for years.Recently, the development of resistance against the available drugs against particularly
malaria and leishmania parasites has been reported.Especially malaria and leishmaniasis remain serious diseases despite the efforts to
control the diseases and reduce their prevalence by vector eradication and drug
treatment.More than 12 million people in the world are inflicted by leishmaniasis. There are
more than 400,000 new cases and 100,000 deaths each year but as many as 350 million
people are at risk of infection (WHO,1990). The annual incidence of clinical leishmaniasis
is estimated to exceed 2,000,000 cases in some 80 countries. It is one of the 7 important
tropical diseases included in the TDR program.Leishmaniasis are characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations depending
on the strain of the parasite and the host immune response. The parasites infect
macrophages and multiply inside these cells. The first step in the Leishmania/macrophage
interactions is the binding of the parasite to the macrophage followed by uptake
of the parasite. Integrity and fluidity of the host cell membrane is essential for this
interaction. Certain parasite surface antigens such as membrane glycoprotein (Gp63)
and lipophosphoglycan (LPG) as well as a number of macrophage surface receptors are
also important in binding and uptake of the parasite by macrophages.Various species of the protozoan parasite Leishmania cause a broad spectrum of 
diseases ranging from the cutaneous healing skin lesions caused by
