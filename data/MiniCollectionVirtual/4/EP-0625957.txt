<ABSTRACT>
Regeneration of hydrochloric acid by hydrolysis of iron chloride in aqueous solution employs a Pelletiser (5) after preconcentration of acid solution in a "Pre-Evaporator" (1). Pelletiser (5) controls pellet mixture to between 12 % and 14 % free water by recycling dried solids from Roaster (3), from Screen (7), or from dust removal Cyclone (9), and waste liquid from Preconcentrator (1). Preconcentrator (1) is contacted with superheated gas from Fluid Bed Roaster (3). Rotary Drier (6) dries pellets with a con-current hot gas stream and the pellets are screened at (7) with oversize being sent to a Mill (8), undersize recycled to Pelletiser (5), and sized feed delivered to Roaster (3). HC1 is produced as gas offtake from Preconcentrator (1) and passes via a demisting Cyclone into adiabatic Absorption Process section (11), where weak acid liquor and water (10) are added as required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates particularly to regeneration
of hydrochloric acid from the iron chloride liquor that
results from the leaching of iron from ilmenite, to form
synthetic rutile. It applies also to regeneration of
hydrochloric acid from pickle liquor produced from
treating the surface of steel with hydrochloric acid.
The relevant reactions for ilmenite are:
A(i)    FeO TiO2 + 2HCl → TiO2 + FeCl2 + H2OA(ii)    2 Fe Cl2 + 2 H2O + 0.5 O2 → Fe2O3 + 4HCl (gas)Because of the cost of new acid, and/or the cost of
disposal of iron chloride liquor, the commercial use of
hydrochloric acid as a leachant for ilmenite depends on
the availability of a technically viable and
cost-effective method of regenerating and recovering the
hydrochloric acid.Regeneration of hydrochloric acid is in common use in the
steel industry world-wide. For example the acid is used
for cleaning steel and wire before galvanising. This
process is known as "pickling" and the resultant liquor,
consisting largely of iron chlorides and some free acid, is
known as "pickle liquor". GB-A-1285083 (Environmental Technology Inc) discloses
a process for regeneration of pickling liquor in which pickling
liquor flows over a bed of inert solids, while contacting the
liquor with hot gases to evaporate the water. Crystalline iron
chloride is deposited on the inert particles, which is converted
to iron oxide (Fe2O3) by oxidation. The hydrogen chloride formed
by this reaction is recovered by absorption and recycled to the
pickling process.Another process for recovering hydrochloric acid from
pickling liquors is disclosed in GB-A-1156063. The recovery of
the acid is effected by evaporation of the acid in direct heat
exchange with hot gases. The hydrogen chloride contained in the
resulting gases is then removed by an absorber.Regeneration technology generally uses either a spray
roasting (Ruthner), process, or a fluidised bed (Lurgi), process,
both of which produce iron as a by-product. The reactions,
which are essentially similar to those involving ilmenite, are
as follows:
B (i)    FeO + 2HCl → FeCl2 + H2OB (ii)    2FeCl2 + 2H2O + 0.502 → Fe2O3 + 4HCl (gas)In both cases the acid can be regenerated by hydrolysis of
the iron chlorides. Excess water is removed by heat, and
the iron oxide as dust, or as a pellet by-product.Although the hydrolysis reaction is exothermic (Δ H800°C =
- 112.6kJ [- 26.9kcal]) the quantity of water that has to
be boiled off requires an external heat source.The principal difference between regeneration of pickle
liquor and
