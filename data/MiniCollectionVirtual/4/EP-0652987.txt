<ABSTRACT>
In a textile machine, in particular in a knitting machine, with controllable working elements (3) and an arrangement for selecting the working elements, the working elements (3) are held in their initial position by a holding magnet (8) and are selectively released from their initial position by an electromagnetic control system (12, 13). In order to obtain a textile machine with a simple design, capable of being driven at high working speeds but in a reliable and safe manner, at least one holding magnet (8) is rigidly fixed to the part of the textile machine that carries the working elements (3). A direct contact between the working elements (3) and the moving control system (12 or 13) is thus avoided, so that a contactless selection of the working elements (3) is made possible.

Textile machine, in particular a knitting machine, 
including controllable working elements (3) and a working 

element selection device, wherein the working elements 
(3) are held in their initial position by a holding 

magnet (8) and are selectively released from their 
initial position by at least one electromagnetic control 

system (12, 13), wherein the holding magnet (8) is 
rigidly fixed to the part (2) of the textile machine 

carrying the working elements (3), characterised in that, 
the control system (12, 13) is movable in a non-contact 

making manner over at least one external surface of the 
working elements (3) and that the holding magnet (8) 

extends over the whole length of the textile machine 
comprising the working elements (3). 
Textile machine as in Claim 1, characterised in that 
the working elements (3) consist of a ferromagnetic 

material. 
Textile machine as in anyone of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the control system (12, 13) 

comprises at least one controllable selection magnet (14) 
which applies a controllable magnetic flux to at least 

one working element (3) and that the selection magnet 
(14) selectively produces a magnetic flux which is 

directed oppositely to the magnetic flux produced by the 
holding magnet (8). 
Textile machine as in anyone of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the working elements (3) each 

comprise a spring part (7) for biasing purposes. 
Textile machine as in Claim 4, characterised in that 
the spring part (7) is formed in one piece with the 

working element (3).  
 
Textile machine as in Claim 4 or 5, characterised in 
that the magn
itude of the magnetic flux of the holding 
magnet (8) is selected to be such that it holds the 

working elements (3) in their initial position against 
the spring force of the spring part (7). 
Textile machine as in Claim 3, characterised in that, 
when selecting a working element (3), the selection 

magnet (14) produces a magnetic flux which corresponds 
substantially in strength to the magnetic flux produced 

by the holding magnet (8) but which is directed 
oppositely thereto. 
Textile machine as in Claim 3 or 7, characterised in 
that the selection magnet (14) is an electromagnet 

including at least one excitation coil (15) through which 
a controlled current flows. 
Textile machine as in Claim 3, 7 or 8, characterised 
in that the surface shape and/or dimensions or size of 

the pole faces (20) of the selection magnet (14) 
substantially correspond to the outer surfaces of the 

working elements (3) which face the control system (12, 
13). 
Textile machine as in anyone of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the control system (12, 13) 

comprises at least two control regions which are spaced 
apart from one another in the direction of movement. 
Textile machine as in anyone of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the textile machine is a circular 

or flat bed knitting machine.  
 
Textile machine as in anyone of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the working elements (3) are 

needles. 
Textile machine as in anyone of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the working elements (3) are jacks. 
Textile machine as in anyone of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the working elements (3) are placed 

in their initial position by at least one control element 
(19). 
Textile machine as in Claim 14, characterised in that 
the control element (19) is a presser cam. 
Textile machine as in anyone of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the pole face (20) of the selection 

magnet (14) is guided in a non-contact making manner past 
the end faces of the working elements (3) facing away 

from the needles. 
Textile machine as in anyone of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the holding magnet (8) is arranged 

below a needle bed (2). 
Textile machine as in Claim 17, characterised in that 
the holding magnet (8) extends over the full length of 

the needle bed (2) in the form of a magnetic strip. 
Textile machine as in anyone of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that a yoke strip (10), whose yoke pole 

face is the holding surface of a corresponding holding 
part (6) of the working element (3), is connected to the 

holding magnet (8). 
Textile machine as in Claim 19, characterised in that 
the yoke strip (10) is an L-shaped web consisting of  

 
ferromagnetic material which extends over the full length 

of the holding magnet (8).
