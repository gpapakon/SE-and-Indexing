Coating composition based on polycondensates of one 
or more hydrolizable compounds of at least one element M of 

the main groups III to V and the subgroups II to IV of the 
periodic system of elements, at least a part of said compounds 

having also non-hydrolizable, carbon-containing groups B in 
addition to hydrolizable groups A and the total molar ratio 

of groups A to groups B in the monomeric starting compounds 
from which they are derived being 10:1 to 1:2, characterized 

in that 0.1 to 100 mol-% of said groups B are groups B' which 
on the average contain 5 to 30 fluorine atoms bonded to one 

or more aliphatic carbon atoms, said carbon atoms being 
separated from M by at least two atoms. 
Coating composition according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the elements M are selected from Si, Al, B, 

Pb, Sn, Ti, Zr, V and Zn, particularly from Si, Al, Ti and Zr, 
or mixtures of said elements. 
Coating composition according to any one of claims 
1 and 2, characterized in that the molar ratio of groups A to 

groups B is from 5:1 to 1:1, and particularly from 4:1 to 2:1. 
Coating composition according to any one of claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that 1 to 50, particularly 20 to 30, 

and particularly preferred 5 to 25 mol-% of the groups B are 
groups B'. 
Coating composition according to any one of claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that in the groups B', on the average 

5 to 25 and particularly 8 to 18 fluorine atoms are bonded to 
aliphatic carbon atoms, which carbon atoms are separated from 

M by at least two other atoms, preferably carbon atoms. 
Coating composition according to any one of claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that 1 to 100, particularly 5 to 85,  

 
and particularly preferred 20 to 70 mol-% of the groups B 

(including the groups B') have at least one carbon-to-carbon 
double or triple bond and are preferably selected from 

acryloxyalkyl and methacryloxyalkyl groups. 
Coating composition according to any one of claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that particularly in the presence of 

hydrolizable compounds of Al, Ti and/or Zr a part of the 
groups B forms a complex with the corresponding M, the complex 

forming groups being preferably selected from optionally 
fluorinated and/or optionally unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic 

acids, β-diketones and esters of β-carbonylcarboxylic acids. 
Coating composition according to any one of claims 
6 and 7, characterized in that it also contains a photo-initiator. 
Coating composition according to any one of claims 
6 to 8, characterized in that it further contains one or more 

radically polymerizable carbon compounds, preferably selected 
from styrene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and derivatives 

thereof. 
Process for the preparation of a coating composition 
according to claim 1, characterized in that first all or 

a part of the starting compounds without groups B' are hydrolized 
and precondensed by the addition of water, then the 

starting compounds having groups B' are added and after the 
reaction thereof with the precondensates already present, the 

hydrolysis and condensation of the species present is continued 
by adding further water and optionally the remaining 

starting compounds without groups B' until a system capable 
of being coated is obtained, the addition of the starting 

compounds having groups B' being effected only after the water 
content of the system is not more than 5% by wt., based on the 

total weight of the system without optionally employed  
 

solvent, and not more than 50% of the theoretically possible 
M-OH groups are present in the system. 
Process according to claim 10, characterized in 
that at least 90 and preferably at least 95 mol-% of the 

hydrolizable groups A in the starting compounds are alkoxy 
groups, particularly C₁₋₄ alkoxy groups and particularly 

preferred methoxy and ethoxy. 
Process according to any one of claims 10 and 11, 
characterized in that the starting compounds are compounds of 

Si, optionally in combination with compounds of Al and/or Zr 
and/or Ti. 
Process according to any one of claims 10 to 12, 
characterized in that the water content of the system prior 

to the addition of the starting compounds having groups B' is 
not higher than 3.5, and particularly not higher than 2 % by 

wt. 
Process according to any one of claims 10 to 13, 
characterized in that the molar ratio of total water added to 

hydrolizable groups A in all of the starting compounds 
employed ranges from 1:1 to 0.3:1, particularly from 0.7:1 to 

0.5:1. 
Use of the coating composition according to any one 
of claims 1 to 9 for coating glass, ceramics, metal, plastics 

and paper, particularly for coating the exterior and interior 
mirrors of motor vehicles.
