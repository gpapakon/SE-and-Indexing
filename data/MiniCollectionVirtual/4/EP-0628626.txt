<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to monoesters of 
rosin acids which are useful as a total or partial 

replacement for extender or processing oil in rubber 
formulations. Addition of these monoesters of rosin 

acid improve the modulus and tear of the vulcanizate. 
The monoesters are of the formula: 


wherein R¹ and R² are the same or different hydrocarbon 
radicals selected from the group consisting of 

saturated alkyl and cycloalkyl radicals containing 3 
to 20 carbon atoms, aryl radicals containing 6 carbon 

atoms and aralkyl radicals containing 7 to 20 carbon 
atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
Both natural and synthetic elastomers usually
require the use of processing aids to assist
mechanical breakdown and compounding. Materials such
as mixtures of oil soluble sulfonic acids of high
molecular weight with a high boiling alcohol, paraffin
oils, blends of sulfonated petroleum products and
selected mineral oils are conventionally used as
processing aids. Additional examples include
petroleum, paraffinic and vegetable oils, coal tar,
petroleum residues or pitches and naturally occurring
or synthetic resins.One advantage in using processing aids is they
assist the incorporation of fillers and other
ingredients with low power consumption since they
reduce internal friction in calendering and extrusion.
By reducing the amount of friction during compounding,
the temperature of the rubber will remain lower and
thus minimize the possibility of scorch.Various types of rosin acids have been used as
extenders for high molecular weight SBR. See
Properties of GR-S Extended With Rosin Type Acids, L.
H. Howland, J. A. Reynolds, and R. L. Provost,
Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, Vol. 45, No. 5,
May 1953. Whereas reasonably good cured physical
properties can be obtained with the rosin type acids,
there are problems associated with their use which
include cure retardation, high tack and poor low
temperature performance, which limit their use as an
extender in rubber formulations.US-A-4,491,655 discloses the use of methyl
esters of rosin acid as total or partial replacement
for oil in a rubber formulation. Compared with the
use of aromatic extending oils in rubbers, methyl
esters of rosin acids provide comparable processing 
and low temperature performance and superior abrasive
resistance. Unfortunately, use of methyl esters of rosin
acid does not benefit the vulcanizate properties related to
rebound and tear. These properties are typically improved
by the supplemental addition of a multitude of additives.
The cost of compounding all these additives as well as the
potential and detrimental interaction of these additives is
preferably avoided.US-A-5 021 493 discloses the use of sulfur curable
rubber compounds containing a 2,5-diorganohydroquinone.
Unfortunately, use of a diorganohydroquinone does not
provide a significant improvement in compound modulus and
tear. Diorganohydroquinone must also be used at low levels
(0.5-5 phr) since it affects cure rate by causing a rubber
compound to become scorchy or having the tendency to
premature cure. Therefore, there is a need for a single
additive which can improve a
