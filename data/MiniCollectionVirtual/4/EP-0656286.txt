<ABSTRACT>
Anti-theft device to clamp pedals of motor vehicles, which 
is suitable to clamp a pair of pedals and comprises an upper 

tubular shaft (12) and a lower tubular shaft (13), the 
shafts (12-13) being telescopic, coaxial and able to move 

reciprocally, the upper tubular shaft (12) including at its 
upper end means for the reciprocal clamping of the shafts 

(12-13) and at its lower end diametrically opposed rigid 
hooks (16), which are positioned substantially at a right 

angle to the axis of the upper shaft (12) and include at a 
median position a cam-shaped protrusion (17), the lower 

tubular shaft (13) including at its lower end a supporting 
foot (18) and at an intermediate position articulated hooks 

(19), these articulated hooks (19) having a lowered 
unclamping position (19a) and a clamping position (19b) in 

which the articulated hooks (19) cooperate directly with the 
rigid hooks (16) so as to define lodgements (22) to hold and 

clamp the levers (11) of the pedals, the articulated hooks 
(19) comprising abutment elements (23) cooperating with the 

cam-shaped protrusions (17) when the upper tubular shaft 
(12) is thrust downwards for complete blocking of the levers 

(11) of the pedals in the lodgements (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an anti-theft device to clamp 
pedals of motor vehicles as set forth in the main claim. The anti-theft device to clamp pedals according to the 
invention is used to clamp the brake and clutch pedals of a 
motor vehicle securely and quickly. The anti-theft device according to the invention is 
applied to any type of motor vehicle irrespective of the 
make and model of the vehicle. Many anti-theft devices for motor vehicles have been 
disclosed which clamp at least one pedal of the vehicle. One type of anti-theft device comprises a telescopic shaft 
with terminal hooks to be inserted below one pedal and on 
the steering wheel, this telescopic shaft being clamped 
longitudinally by locking means; this device is not very 
secure since it acts on only one pedal, which is not always 
perfectly clamped owing to the ample play permitted by the 
rigid hook. Moreover these hooks may scratch or spoil the 
steering wheel. Other anti-theft devices have been disclosed which clamp 
two pedals, namely the brake pedal and clutch pedal, but 
these devices require difficult, burdensome and awkward 
manual operations both during the closing step and during 
the opening and removal step, and these operations make the 
use of those devices not very practical. FR-A-2.625.962 discloses an anti-theft device comprising a 
box-shaped element including notches with which the levers 
of the pedals cooperate; the levers are clamped therein by a 
suitably shaped clamping shaft able to slide perpendicularly 
to the notches. This box-shaped element comprises also a leg, which can be 
adjusted for height and cooperates at its free end with the  
 
floor of the vehicle so as to clamp the device against the 
levers of the pedals; this device is not at all practical to 
use, requires manual operations for adjustment to the 
various types of vehicle and does not clamp the levers of 
the pedals securely since the sizes of the seatings defined 
by the notches and by the clamping shaft are much greater 
than those of the levers of the pedals. IT-A-1.149.007 discloses another anti-theft device to 
clamp pedals; this device comprises a fork shaped as an 
overturned "U" and borne on a tubular support which faces 
upwards and is equipped at its upper end with a safety lock; 
a clamping stirrup borne on an articulated rod able to slide 
within the support cooperates with the lock to clamp the 
levers of the pedals between the stirrup and the fork when 
the latter is placed astride the levers. This device cannot be applied to

<CLAIMS>
Anti-theft device to clamp pedals of motor 
vehicles, which is suitable to clamp a pair of pedals and 

comprises an upper tubular shaft (12) and a lower tubular 
shaft (13), these shafts (12-13) being telescopic, coaxial 

and able to move reciprocally, the upper tubular shaft (12) 
including at its upper end means for the reciprocal clamping 

of the shafts (12-13) and at its lower end diametrically 
opposed rigid hooks (16), which are positioned substantially 

at a right angle to the axis of the upper shaft (12), the 
lower tubular shaft (13) including at its lower end a 

supporting foot (18) and at an intermediate position 
articulated hooks (19), these articulated hooks (19) having 

a lowered unclamping position (19a) and a clamping position 
(19b) in which the articulated hooks (19) cooperate directly 

with the rigid hooks (16) so as to define lodgements (22) to 
hold and clamp the levers (11) of the pedals, 


characterised in that
 the rigid hooks include a 
cam-shaped protrusion (17) located at a median position between them 

and 
extending downwards therefrom, the articulated hooks (19) 

comprising abutment elements (23) cooperating with the cam-shaped 
protrusion (17) when the upper tubular shaft (12) is 

thrust downwards to rotate and raise the articulated hooks 
for complete blocking of the levers (11) of the pedals in 

the lodgements (22).  
 
Anti-theft device as in Claim 1, in which the rigid 
hooks (16) include terminal angled portions (116), while the 

articulated hooks (19) include terminal seatings (119), the 
angled portions (116) cooperating with the seatings (119) in 

the clamping position (19b) of the articulated hooks (19).

ring nut (27) being associated with an adjustment screw (28) 
cooperating with the lower side of the supporting foot (18). 
Anti-theft device as in Claim 3, in which the clamping 
means (26) comprise two coaxial sleeves, namely a first

respectively, which cooperate with the upper part of the 

male-threaded rod (25) and include an intermediate resilient 
ring (30), the first upper sleeve (29a) containing a 

threaded hole (42) associated with the adjustment screw (28)

includes adapter elements (31) associated with the 
articulated hooks (19) and clamping the levers (11) of the 

pedals laterally.
