<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing stabilized alumina having increased surface area retention at high temperature in which a gel of a boehmite alumina which has been obtained by hydrothermally treating an aqueous mixture of a precursor beohmite alumina having a pH of from about 5 to about 9 for a period of time sufficient to convert the greater portion of the precursor boehmite alumina to a colloidal sol is subjected to working as, for example, by using a sufficient shearing force for a sufficient period of time to produce a worked boehmite alumina which has an increase in pore volume of at least about 30 percent and an increase of median pore radius of at least about 20 percent, a stabilizer being added to the boehmite alumina, the stabilizer being an oxide of a metal such as barium or a metal included in the lanthanide series of metals or a compound of such metals which converts to an oxide at elevated temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PREPARATION OF STABILIZED ALUMINA HAVING ENHANCED RESISTANCE TO LOSS OF SURFACE AREA AT HIGH TEMPERATURESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the Invention5 The present invention relates to a process for producing alumina which can be converted to catalyst supports exhibiting enhanced resistance to loss of surface area when subjected to high temperatures.2. Description of the BackgroundOne of the key requirements of a catalyst support or substrate such as alumina10 (Al2O3) is high surface area. Increased surface area allows for deposition of the catalytically active species, enhances reactivity between the catalytically active species and the reactants and, in general, makes for a more efficient catalyst support. In the case of catalyst supports of alumina used in catalytic converters for automobiles, i.e. autocatalyst supports, high surface area is particularly desirable because of short15 residence times between reactants and catalytic species, the desire to minimize the size of the catalytic converter and hence the need for a high efficiency catalyst.A particular problem with autocatalyst supports involves the high temperatures to which the supports are subjected. High temperatures deleteriously effect the structural integrity of the catalyst support resulting in a loss of surface area. In20 effect, the elevated temperatures cause the catalyst to collapse on itself.It is known that stabilizers such as oxides of barium and the lanthanide series of elements can stabilize autocatalysts in the sense that the loss of structural integrity of the support is retarded. In particular, oxides of barium, lanthanum or other lanthanide elements have been used in alumina based autocatalyst supports as heat25 stabilizers.^ 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing stabilized alumina which can be used in catalyst supports and other structural substrates requiring high surface area. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a catalyst support exhibiting enhanced resistance to structural degradation at high temperatures.The above and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the description given herein and the appended claims.According to the process of the present invention, a stabilized alumina of enhanced resistance to high temperature surface area loss is prepared by forming a gel of a boehmite alumina, the boehmite alumina being obtained by hydrothermally treating an aqueous mixture of a precursor
