<ABSTRACT>
Set of ceramic (refractory) elements for a casting gate (10), comprising a metallic reinforcement (12) mounted on a metallurgical vessel (1), a stationary ceramic plate (14) including a port (14a), a movable ceramic plate (16) including a port (16a), a collector nozzle (42), displacement means for displacing the movable plate (14) with respect to the stationary plate (16) so as to control the covering-over of the port of the stationary plate by the port of the movable plate. Pressure means (26) make it possible to press the movable plate against the stationary plate, a stationary ceramic plate (14) and a movable ceramic plate (16) and the collector nozzle (42) are capable of being linked together so as to constitute a set which may be introduced into and/or removed from the casting gate (10) in a single operation.

Set of refractory components, particularly for slide gate valve (10)
comprising


a metallic frame (12) mounted on a metallurgical vessel (1);
at least one fixed refractory plate (14) having at least one opening (14a);
at least one movable refractory plate (16) having at least one opening (16a);
at least one pouring nozzle (42);
means for displacing the movable plate (14) with respect to the fixed plate
(16) in order to control an overlap between the openings of the fixed and

movable plate;
compression means (26) for locking the movable plate against the fixed
plate;

characterized in that said at least one fixed refractory plate (14) and
said at least one movable refractory plate (16) and said at least one

pouring nozzle (42) can be interconnected so as to form a set which can be
introduced and/or removed with respect to the slide gate valve (10) in a

single operation.
Set according to claim 1, characterized in that the refractory components
constituting the set are interconnected by means permitting a movement

of said at least one fixed refractory plate (14) relative to said at least
one movable refractory plate (16), the amplitude of said movement being

adequate for the operation of the slide gate valve (10).
Set according to one of the claims 1 or 2, characterized in that said
at least one fixed refractory plate (14), said at least one movable

refractory plate (16) and said pouring nozzle (42) have metal shells (38,
40), the connection between the plates being provided by said shells (38,

40).
Set according to claim 3, characterized in that the connection between
said plates (14, 16) is ensured by sliding mechanisms fixed to said metal

shells (38, 40).
Set according to any one of the claims 2 to 4, characterized in that it 

has means for locking the relative movement of said fixed refractory plate
relative to said movable refractory plate in a predetermined and in

particular superimposed position, said means being destroyed during the
first movement of the slide gate valve.
Set according to claim 1, characterized in that the connection between
said at least one fixed refractory plate (14) and said at least one movable

refractory plate (16) is ensured by bonding, the connection by bonding being
destroyed by the first movement of the slide gate valve (10).
Set according to claim 1, characterized in that said plates have means
making it possible to maintain them in a predetermined, particularly superimposed,

relative position by connecting means external of the sets of
refractory plates (14, 16).
Set according to claim 7, characterized in that the external connection
means are constituted by a gripping manipulator (66) able to grasp and/or

lock the refractory component set in a relative position.
Method for the replacement of the set of refractory components of a
slide gate valve, the latter comprising a metallic frame (12) mounted on a

metallurgical vessel (1), at least one fixed refractory plate (14) having
at least one opening (14a), at least one movable refractory plate (16)

having at least one opening (16a), at least one pouring nozzle (42), displacement
means for displacing the mobile plate (14) relative to the fixed

plate (16), so as to control the overlap of the opening of the fixed plate
by the opening of the movable plate, compression means (26) making it

possible to lock the mobile plate against the fixed plate, characterized in
that said refractory component set is installed and/or removed in a single

operation.
Replacement method according to claim 9, characterized in that use is
made of a handling tool (66) incorporating a gripper (68), which ensures a

connection of the components of the refractory set at the time of the
installation and/or deposition of said plates. 
Replacement method according to either of the claims 9 and 10, characterized
in that use is made of a handling tool for removing the used

refractory component set and another handling tool for installing a new
refractory component set, so as to reduce the time necessary for replacing

the plates.
Replacement method according to any one of the claims 9 to 11, characterized
in that the used refractory components are discharged by gravity,

the components of the refractory set being connected only on their introduction
into the slide gate valve.
Method for the replacement of refractory plates according to any one of
the claims 9 to 12, characterized in that the metal shells (38, 40) are

replaced at the same time as the refractory set respectively surrounding
each of said plates.
Replacement method according to any one of the claims 9 to 13, characterized
in that use is made of displacement means (28, 44) of the movable

refractory plate (16) for displacing the set of refractory components into a
position where it is no longer subject to the action of the compression

means (26) making it possible to lock the movable plate (16) against the
fixed plate (14), which frees any attachment to the slide gate valve (10),

so as to permit access to the handling manipulator without opening the
metallic frame (12) of the valve.
Replacement method according to claim 14, characterized in that use is
made of a carrying frame (20) for the fixed plate (14) and a carrying frame

(22) for the movable plate (16), the fixed plate carrying frame and movable
plate carrying frame being joinable by means of a bolt (50) having two

positions mounted on said fixed plate carrying frame (20).
Replacement method according to claim 15, characterized in that the
fixed plate carrying frame (20) has a central opening into which is introduced

the fixed plate (14), and in that the movable plate carrying frame
(22) has a central opening into which is introduced the movable plate (16),

the central opening of the fixed plate carrying frame and the central 
opening of the movable plate carrying frame being superimposed during the

extraction and insertion of the refractory component set.
