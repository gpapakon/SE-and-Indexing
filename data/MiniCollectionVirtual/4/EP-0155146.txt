<ABSTRACT>
Chemically synthesized polypeptides include amino acid 
residue sequences that substantially correspond to the amino 

acid residue sequences of T cell and B cell determinant portions 
of a natural, pathogen-related protein, in particular, a hepatitis 

B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). When administered to a host 
alone, as polymers or as carrier-bound conjugates, the poly­

peptides induce the proliferation of thymus-derived cells in 
hosts primed against hepatitis B virus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chemically 
synthesized polypeptides having amino acid residue 
sequences that substantially correspond to the amino 
acid residue sequences of T cell and B cell 
determinant portions of a natural, pathogen-related 
protein, in particular, a hepatitis B virus surface 
antigen (HBsAg). When administered to a host alone, 
as polymers or as carrier-bound conjugates, the 
polypeptides induce the proliferation of 
thymus-derived cells in hosts primed against 
hepatitis B virus. The present invention relates to the 
production of novel synthetic antigens based upon 
information derived from DNA and/or protein sequences 
and to the use of those antigens in the production of 
vaccines, diagnostic reagents, and the like. More 
specifically, this invention relates to synthetic 
antigenic polypeptides, which when used alone, as a 
polymer or upon coupling to a carrier, 
immunologically correspond to a T cell and B cell 
determinant portion of hepatitis B virus surface 
antigen (HBsAg). Viral hepatitis continues to rank as one of 
the most important unconquered diseases of mankind. 
The general term, viral hepatitis, refers principally 
to hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis) and to 
hepatitis B (serum hepatitis), although other known 
viruses such as yellow fever virus, Epstein-Barr 
virus and cytomegalovirus can cause hepatitis in 
man. Hepatitis is particularly known for its focal  
 
attack on the liver (Greek, hepar), but the disease 
also influences other organs. In 1965, Blumberg discovered an antigen 
circulating in the blood of certain human beings 
[J. Am. Med. Assoc., 191, 541 (1965) and Ann. Int. 
Med., 66, 924 (1967)]. This substance was 
subsequently found by Prince to be the surface 
antigen of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) that is produced 
in abundance by individuals who are chronically 
infected with the agent [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 
(USA), 60, 814 (1968)]. HBsAg has been the subject of extensive 
immunochemical characterization. Serologic studies 
show that several strains of the hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) have one or more determinants in common, which 
is designated a. Each strain also has two other 
determinants: either d or y and either w or r. Thus, 
there are four possible types of the virus: adw, ayw, 
adr and ayr. The specificity of HBsAg is associated 
with a single polypeptide [Gold et al., J. Immunol., 
117, 1404 (1976) and Shih et al., J. Immunol., 120, 
520 (1978)], the entire 226 amino acid sequence of 
which is established from the nucleotide sequence of
