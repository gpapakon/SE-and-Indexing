<ABSTRACT>
A magneto-optical recording medium in which direct 
overwriting can be done by only modifying the power level 

and/or the pulse width of applied optical pulses, and without 
changing the direction of the bias magnetic field. The 

recording layer comprises first and second magnetic recording 
layers (3-1,3-2). The first magnetic layer (3-1) is a rare-earth 

transition metal-amorphous alloy and has a 
perpendicular easy magnetization axis, a thickness of 10 to 

200 nm, and a compensation temperature above room 
temperature. The second magnetic layer (3-2) comprises an 

alloy of a first component of Co and/or Fe and a second 
component of a rare earth metal and/or a noble metal or an 

alloy of Co and at least one metal selected from Ti, Cr, Mn, 
Cu, Zn, Ga and Ge. The second magnetic layer (3-2) is a 

material having an in-plane easy magnetization axis such that 
it has a magnetization axis parallel to the second magnetic 

layer (3-2) if formed independently on a dielectric layer 
(2), the second magnetic layer (3-2) having a thickness of 

not more than 3nm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magneto-optical
recording medium for recording and reproducing
information and which can be rewritten, more
specifically a magneto-optical recording medium in
which direct overwriting can be done by modifying the
power level and/or pulse width of applying laser
pulses, without changing the direction and intensity
of a bias magnetic field.Magneto-optical recording media have been
widely investigated and developed as high density and
high capacity information recording media.
Particularly, rewritable magneto-optical recording
media can be used in various fields and, therefore,
various materials and systems have been proposed
therefor and thus rewritable magneto-optical recording
media have already made into use.When compared with recording media such as
floppy discs and hard discs, magneto-optical recording
media have a drawback in that overwriting is
difficult. Here, overwriting means that old
information is simultaneously erased while new
information is written.Several overwriting technologies for magneto-optical
recording media have been proposed, and one
which has attracted attention is a direct overwriting
system using a self-reversible magneto-optical
recording medium in which the direction of net
remnant magnetization in a portion of the magnetic
wall boundary region heated by a laser beam can be
reversed by modifying the power level and/or the pulse
width of laser pulses between erasing and writing,
without changing the direction and intensity of bias 
magnetic field, since it does not necessitate a
significant modification of the optical system,
magnet, etc. of a presently commercially available
magneto-optical recording apparatus. For examples, see

having an in-plane easy magnetization axis is known,

of the recording layer to the recording magnetic
field, as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) Nos. 02-247846 and 04-370550 and
