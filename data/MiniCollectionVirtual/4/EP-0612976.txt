<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a phase-modulated interferometer having a novel type of drive and signal conditioning. The object of achieving evaluatable heterodyne signals in a phase-modulated interferometer without complicated saw-tooth control of the phase modulator (2) is achieved according to the invention by feeding to the known phase modulator (2) two sinusoidal drive signals with the modulation frequencies ( omega 1,  omega 2) which are coupled in a phase-locked and frequency-locked fashion, and by using an electronic bandpass filter (8) at the filter frequency ( omega F) of which an odd and an even harmonic of the two modulation frequencies ( omega 1,  omega 2) have the same frequency to filter out from the heterodyne signal generated in the interferometer a cosine signal, which is used in the normal way to evaluate the phase shift, when the amplitudes ( phi 1,  phi 2) of the drive signals satisfy the condition for the suitable working point of the phase modulator (2). The invention is applied in phase-modulated interferometers, in particular for precision length measuring instruments having a preferably heterodyne evaluation method.

A phase-modulated interferometer having a measuring 
arm and a reference arm, in which a phase modulator for 

phase modulation of the optical radiation is disposed 
in one of the two interferometer arms, and in which a 

detector is provided to detect an optical heterodyne 
signal from the measuring and reference arm, the 

detector being followed by an electronic evaluator for 
determining the phase shift of the signal,

two sinusoidal trigger signals having different 

modulation frequencies (ω

being in locked phase and frequency relationship,

An arrangement according to claim 2, characterised

An arrangement according to claim 1, characterised

preferably to compensate wavelength drifts of the laser 
source, two reference arms are provided both of which 

produce by heterodyning with the same measuring arm two 
heterodyne signals for separate evaluation, a phase 

modulator (2) is disposed in each of the reference 
arms, there being present at each of these phase 

modulators (2) trigger signals at the modulation 
frequencies (ω

being the same but each being coupled in pairs in 

locked frequency and phase relationship.

phase modulator as trigger signals.  

 
An arrangment according to claim 4 or 5,

provision of the electro-optical phase modulators (2)
