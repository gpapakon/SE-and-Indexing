<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to impedance bonds for railways. Where railway vehicles are electrically powered, the 
vehicles' traction power (which may be supplied to the 
vehicles by, for example, a catenary wire over the 
railway tracks) may be returned to the substation via the 
rails of the track. The highest efficiency is obtained 
when both rails are used. In this case it is necessary 
to connect the rails so as to balance the return of 
traction current between them and to provide a return 
path from both rails to the substation. This may be done 
using a shorting bar to connect the rails directly 
together, but where track circuit signalling is used, 
shorting bars cannot be employed because they would 
short-circuit the track circuit system. In that case, to 
balance the traction current the rails are connected by 
impedance bond connectors which present a low impedance 
at the frequency of operation of the traction circuit but 
a high impedance at the frequency at which the track 
circuit signalling system operates. Conventionally (as shown schematically in Figure 1), 
impedance bonds include an LC circuit connected to the 
rails 1,2 via a transformer and resonated so as to 
have a high impedance at the frequency of the track 
circuit signals. The traction current is returned to the 
substation via a centre tap of the transformer. Where 
the bond acts only to balance the traction currents in 
the rails the centre tap is left unused. However, 
impedance bonds must maintain their impedance 
characteristics over a range of temperatures (to cope 
with varying weather conditions). It is difficult to 
design conventional impedance bonds to achieve this 
effect; and in overcoming the problem conventional 
impedance bonds are generally made to be bulky. According to the present invention there is provided an  
 
impedance bond unit for use in returning traction circuit 
current from first and second rails of a railway track, 
comprising: 
a first input for connection to said first rail; a second input for connection to said second rail; a traction output for returning traction current; 
and control means coupled with the first and second 
inputs and the traction output for allowing flow of 
traction current from the first and second inputs to the 
traction output, and acting to reduce the flow of 
signalling current between the first and second inputs, 
characterised in that said control means comprises active 
control means which includes: 
sensing means for sensing the flow of signalling 
current between
