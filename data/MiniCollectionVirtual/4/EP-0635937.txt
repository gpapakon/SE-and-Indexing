an input signal, the amplitude of which is proportional to the frequency of 

said input signal; amplifier means for providing an amplified output signal; 
bandwidth tracking means located between said input means and said 

amplifier means and defining a low-pass filtering stage and a voltage divider 
network, said bandwidth tracking means being controlled by servo means in 

response to the output of said amplifier means, so that the upper cutoff 
frequency of said low-pass filtering stage varies in a proportionate manner 

with the frequency of said input signal and so that the amplitude of said 
amplified output signal remains substantially constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to what can be referred to as
"bandwidth tracking", and more particularly to a circuit for controlling the
overall upper cutoff frequency of an amplifier stage which receives an input
signal, the amplitude of which is proportional to the frequency of said input
signal. As an example, the input signal is received from a magnetic head.The desirability for "bandwidth tracking" as disclosed herein arises
from a system requiring maximum signal-to-noise ratio in conjunction with a
rather large range in operating frequency, such as a magnetic recording/play
back system. A fixed bandwidth (upper cutoff frequency) based on
maximum operating frequency wouid result in comparatively poor signal-to-noise
ratio at the minimum operating frequency. Alternatively, a fixed
bandwidth based on minimum operating frequency would be inadequate for
higher frequency operation.U.S. Patent 4,446,493 discloses a variable frequency response equalizer
which varies the time constant associated with the equalizer based on
amplified signal. The magnitude of the time constant is reduced when the
level of the signal amplified becomes lower than a predetermined value.
Such a solution, as well as the approaches described in other patents of
interest, i.e. U.S. 4,479,152, and U.S. 4, 633,200 present the drawback of
requiring very complex and sophisticated circuitry comprising transistors,
delay means, switchable networks, voltage controlled amplifiers, etc. AT-A-347794 describes a circuit for the reduction of
low-frequency noise in a signal such as that received from
a magnetic head comprising the features of the preamble of
Claim 1.Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a simple,
inexpensive and efficient circuit for controlling the
overall upper cutoff frequency of an amplifier stage over
the range of operating conditions.It would further be desirable to control the overall 
upper cutoff frequency of such an amplifier stage under no-signal conditions,
in order to reduce output noise under said conditions.The circuit according to the invention is defined in claim 1.According to a preferred aspect of the invention said bandwidth tracking
means comprises an AGC element having a variable resistance Ragc which is
common to said low-pass filtering stage and said voltage divider network,
the value of said variable resistance Ragc being controlled by an AGC
circuitry connected to the output of said amplifier means, a capacitor being
connected in parallel to said variable resistance Ragc.These and other
