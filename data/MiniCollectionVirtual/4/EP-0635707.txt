<ABSTRACT>
An annular force measuring device having a geometry suitable for suppressing radial deformations is proposed. The said device consists of an upper ring and a lower ring (10, 14) having pressure-sensitive thick-layer resistance elements (11). The radial width (b2) of the lower ring (10) corresponds advantageously to 2 to 4 times the radial width (b1) of the upper ring (14), the axial height (h2) of the lower ring to 2 to 4 times the axial height (h1) of the upper ring (14) and the radial width of the thick-layer resistance (11) to at least the radial width (b1) of the upper ring (14) on the contact surface. The thick-layer resistance element (11) is arranged centrally in the radial direction on the lower ring (10).
