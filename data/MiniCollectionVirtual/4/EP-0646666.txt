<ABSTRACT>
Weaving loom with a sley having a given weaving 
range, and provided with at least one first and one 

second sley leg (21; 22), respectively, for supporting 
the sley (2), said sley legs being arranged in the form 

of a deformable rectangle with hinge points at (A, B, C, 
D), and with a knee mechanism (10) for driving sley (2). 

The knee mechanism is rotatably connected to said sley 
leg (21), to the top side thereof, by means of a connecting 

rod (6), said sley legs being connected, at their 
respective base side, to a first and second reed rotary 

shaft (23; 24), both said reed rotary shafts (23; 24) 
running mutually parallel and being mounted on a cross 

girder (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a weaving loom 
having an improved sley movement. Weaving looms whose sley is driven by a knee 
mechanism are known. This knee mechanism is suitable for 
carrying out a sley movement with double beat-up. In Belgian Patent No. BE-895266 a weaving loom is 
disclosed in which the sley is provided with a pair of 
sley legs which are arranged in the form of a parallelogram 
support and the sley is further driven by such a 
knee mechanism which interacts with a cam. When the sley 
carries out a movement, the weaving reed maintains its 
vertical orientation during the oscillating beat-up 
movement, which takes place in the form of arcs on said 
sley legs with parallelogram support. Using the knee 
mechanism, a large beat-up pressure force can be effected 
with a limited drive torque on the cam, as is well known 
in the field of mechanical presses. However, a weaving loom of this kind has various 
disadvantages. In order to span a weaving width of large 
dimensions, this sley has to be designed such that it has 
great flexural stiffness, as only two drive points can be 
provided alongside the warp threads on both sides of the 
loom. Consequently, the sley has to be designed as a 
heavy girder supported by various parallelogram supporting 
legs which act as sley legs. Therefore, these sley 
legs do not contribute towards the flexural stiffness of 
the unit. In addition, the drive is only transmitted by 
two drive points which are located outside the fabric 
layer. This results in a considerable flexural strain on 
the sley. A sley construction of this kind is relatively 
heavy. This brings with it a high moment of inertia which 
has an adverse effect on the weaving speeds and, in 
addition, also generates vibrations of the ground. Document BE-900016 discloses a weaving loom which 
is provided with a sley with parallelogram support and 
direct cam drive. With this weaving loom, effecting a  
 
double beat-up movement by means of the design of the cam 
profile is very difficult. The drive of the sley takes 
place over a large width by the twisting moment of one 
single reed rotary shaft. This reed rotary shaft thus has 
to be dimensioned to be large in order to be able to 
transmit the required twisting moment. Furthermore, the 
cam drives have to be fitted under the fabric layer in 
order to reduce the torsion arm. Fitting the drive groups 
under the fabric layer is relatively complicated and 
makes access for any repair work relatively difficult. The object of the weaving loom
