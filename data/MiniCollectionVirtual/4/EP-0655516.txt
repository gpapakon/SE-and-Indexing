<ABSTRACT>
Coating of solid particles in a fluidised bed by application of a gaseous coating agent from a plasma, wherein the plasma is generated outside the fluidised bed at a pressure of 0.01 to 500 mbar, and the plasma-activated gas is passed into the fluidised bed which is operated at a pressure of 0.1 to 500 mbar, where   a. the plasma is generated from the total amount of gaseous coating agent with or without another gas, or b. the plasma is generated from a portion of the gaseous coating agent with or without another gas, and the remaining portion is introducd directly into the fluidised bed, or c. the plasma is generated from another gas, and the total amount of gaseous coating agent is introduced directly into the fluidised bed.

<CLAIMS>
A process for coating solid particles in a fluidized bed by 
application of a gaseous coating agent from a plasma, wherein 

the plasma is generated outside the fluidized bed under a 
pressure of from 0.01 to 500 mbar, and the plasma-activated 

gas is passed into the fluidized bed, which is operated under 
a pressure of from 0.1 to 500 mbar, where 


a. the plasma is generated from the total amount of gaseous 
coating agent with or without another gas, or 
b. the plasma is generated from a portion of the gaseous 
coating agent with or without another gas, and the remaining 

portion is introduced directly into the fluidized 
bed, or 
c. the plasma is generated from another gas, and the total 
amount of gaseous coating agent is introduced directly 

into the fluidized bed. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the gaseous coating 
agent contains hydrocarbons, alkanols, silanes, organosilicon 

and/or organometallic compounds. 
A process for the surface treatment of solid particles in a 
fluidized bed by the action of a gaseous treating agent from 

a plasma, wherein the plasma is generated outside the fluidized 
bed under a pressure of from 0.01 to 500 mbar, and the 

plasma-activated gas is passed into the fluidized bed, which 
is operated under a pressure of from 0.1 to 500 mbar, where 


a. the plasma is generated from the total amount of gaseous 
treating agent with or without another gas, or  

 
b. the plasma is generated from a portion of the gaseous 
treating agent with or without another gas, and the remaining 

portion is introduced directly into the fluidized 
bed, or 
c. the plasma is generated from another gas, and the total 
amount of gaseous treating agent is introduced directly 

into the fluidized bed. 
A process as claimed in claim 3, wherein the gaseous treating 
agent contains oxygen and/or an oxygen-containing compound, 

nitrogen and/or a nitrogen-containing compound and/or a noble 
gas. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein the plasma is 
generated by means of an alternating voltage with a frequency 

of from 5 kHz to 5 GHz. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 5, wherein the plasma of 
the treating or coating agent is generated at a pressure in 

the range from 0.01 to 100 mbar, and the fluidized bed is 
operated at a pressure in the range from 0.1 to 100 mbar.
