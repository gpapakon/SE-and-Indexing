<ABSTRACT>
A programmable semiconductor memory with filament or point diodes in 
the intersections of a matrix system can be manufactured with minimum dimensions and 

thus with a very high density owing to the absence of alignment tolerances. A possible 
problem is then posed by the strong leakage currents which may arise during 

programming owing to punch-through between adjoining diodes. Decreasing the leakage 
current through the use of a higher background concentration of the region in which 

these diodes are formed is not very well possible because this reduces the breakdown 
voltage of the pn junctions of the diodes too much. According to the invention, a more 

strongly doped surface zone is provided in said region between the diodes, which zone 
is situated at least at a distance from the diode points. In a specific embodiment, said 

zone extends less deeply into the region than do the diodes. The invention is based on 
the recognition that the breakdown voltage is determined by the location where the 

curvature of the diode is strongest. The said zone suppresses the leakage current to a 
high degree, while the breakdown voltage of the diodes remains sufficiently high.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a programmable semiconductor device comprising
a semiconductor body provided with a comparatively weakly doped surface region of a
first conductivity type which is covered by a dielectric layer on which a number of
semiconductor regions of a second, opposite conductivity type and a comparatively high
doping concentration are provided side by side, each semiconductor region in
combination with the subjacent portions of the dielectric layer and the surface region
forming a programmable element which is programmed in that a sufficiently high
voltage is applied between the semiconductor region and the surface region, so that
owing to breakdown across the dielectric layer a zone of the second conductivity type is
formed in the surface region, which zone is conductively connected to the
semiconductor region and forms a rectifying junction between the semiconductor region
and the surface region. The invention also relates to a programmable semiconductor
memory comprising such a semiconductor device.A semiconductor device of the kind described above is known from, inter
alia, US Patent 4,881,114. In this known device, the semiconductor body is formed by
an n-type silicon substrate in which locally a p-type surface region is provided in the
form of a diffused zone. The dielectric layer is formed, for example, by a thin
composite layer of silicon oxide, silicon nitride, and silicon oxide. On this layer are
formed semiconductor regions of comparatively strongly doped n-type polycrystalline
silicon, called poly for short hereinafter. The dielectric layer forms an anti-fuse which
makes a transition from non-conducting in the non-programmed state to conducting
during programming. During programming, a sufficiently high voltage is applied
between the p-type surface region in the semiconductor body and an n-type poly region,
whereby breakdown takes place locally in the dielectric layer and a pinhole is formed in
the dielectric layer. Owing to heat generation, n-type dopant diffuses from the poly into
the p-type surface region, so that an n-type zone is created in this region which forms a 
pn junction with the surface region. Arranged in a matrix, these elements may form a
programmable memory (PROM) or a programmable logic array (PLA). An important
advantage of the use of such programmable elements is, as also stated in the cited US
Patent, that extremely high densities can be obtained.It was found in practice that, for example, in memories built up from
these programmable elements strong

<CLAIMS>
A programmable semiconductor device comprising a semiconductor body
with a comparatively weakly doped surface region (3) formed by

an epitaxial layer of a first conductivity type which merges into a substrate region (1),
of the second conductivity type via a pn-junction

said surface region being covered by a dielelectric layer (4) on which a number of semiconductor
regions (5a, 5b, 5c) of a second, opposite conductivity type and a comparatively high doping

concentration are provided side by side, each semiconductor region in combination with the
subjacent portions of the dielectric layer and the surface region forming a programmable

element which is programmed when a sufficiently high voltage is applied between the
semiconductor region and the surface region, so that owing to breakdown across the

dielectric layer a zone (8) of the second conductivity type is formed in the surface region,
which zone is conductively connected to the semiconductor region and forms a point-shaped

rectifying junction between the semiconductor region and the surface region wherein
at least the surface adjoining portions of the surface region located below the gaps

between the semiconductor regions are provided with a surface zone (9) of the same
conductivity type as and with a higher doping concentration than the surface region, said surface zone (9)

extending into the semiconductor body
over a depth which is smaller than the depth of the zone (8) of the second conductivity type

formed in the surface region of the first conductivity type during programming, said zone (8) adjoining
the surface zone (9) of the first conductivity type, the depth of the surface zone (9) being so small

that the breakdown voltage of the pn-junctions formed during programming is at least
substantially determined by the comparatively low doping concentration of the surface region (3)

and is not or substantially not influenced by the surface zone (9), and in that a buried layer (10)
with a higher doping concentration of the first conductivity type than the surface region is formed at the interface between the surface region of the first

conductivity type and the substrate region of the second conductivity type.
