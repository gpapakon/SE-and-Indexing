<ABSTRACT>
Process for continuous impregnation of absorbent webs, in particular of dry webs such as those of paper, in which impregnating liquid is absorbed into the web, characterised in that firstly the air is expelled from the web by means of steam, the temperature lying above the condensation temperature of the water in the web, whereupon the web is led through a bath with impregnating liquid which has a temperature below the condensation temperature of the water in the web.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the continuous impregnation of absorbent 
webs, especially of dry webs, such as those made of 

paper, in which impregnating liquid is sucked into the 
web, characterized in that the air is first driven out 

ofthe web by means of steam, the temperature in the 
exchange region being above the temperature of 

condensation of the water in the web, whereupon the web 
is passed through a bath of impregnating liquid at a 

temperature below the temperature of condensation of the 
water in the web. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the bath of impregnating liquid is at room temperature. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the driving-out of the air is carried out by means 

of steam at a temperature of 80째 to 200째, in particular 
of 120째 to 150째. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the web is steered over a preheating roll and is 

preheated on the latter. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the web is pre-wetted, in particular in the region 

before the preheating roll. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a surplus of impregnating liquid is subsequently 

removed in a squeezing station and optionally fed back 
into the bath of impregnating liquid.
