<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of parallel slats (3) constituting a blind (1) consist of transparent base plates (3a), and a figure 
portions (16) are drawn with paint on the slats (3). The figure portions (16) on the slats (3) are combined and integrated 

when the slats (3) are inclined all at once at a predetermined angle, to shut off the rays of light from the rear surface 
of the blind (1) or reflect thereon the rays of light from the side of an observer, whereby a significant figure (18), 

such as a portrait appears on a blind surface (17). This significant figure (18) is recognized when an observer watches 
the blind surface (17) or when it is projected on a wall or a floor. The significant figure (18) creates an excellent 

atmosphere in a room.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blind for use as
an interior article having an element for providing an
excellent interior atmosphere.Blinds originally serve the purpose of adjusting or
blocking the rays of light which are introduced through a
building opening into an interior. To meet a demand for
a comfortable residential space, blinds are also required
to have an element for providing a better interior
atmosphere as well as the functions to adjust and block
the light. Thus, various ideas have been put to practice
in such a way as reducing the width of slates for giving
a light visual impression or coloring the slats with soft
quiet hues, but all such efforts have not brought
satisfactory results.With presently available blinds, much importance is
attached to the functions to adjust and block the light,
and slats are made of light-shielding materials such as a
light alloy. Therefore, even if slats have soft colors,
they look dark as long as viewed from the interior space
in the daytime, thereby reducing the effect of the
intended interior atmosphere.Furthermore, conventional blinds are utterly lacking
in any technical idea for positively utilizing daylight
to provide an excellent atmosphere in the interior space.
The applicant has proposed in Japanese patent application
No. 62-239948 (Japanese laid-open patent publication No.
64-83795) a blind which positively utilizes daylight to 
provide an excellent atmosphere in the interior space,
without impairing the original functions of the blind to
adjust and block the light.The proposed blind has parallel slats angularly
movable simultaneously about their own longitudinal axes,
each slat having a graphic pattern forming region on a
base board of transparent material. The base board has,
in its cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal
axis thereof, a central surface, a first bent surface
bent obliquely upward from one edge of the central
surface, and a second bent surface bent obliquely
downward from the other edge. When the slats are
angularly moved and tilted at a predetermined angle, the
graphic pattern forming regions of the respective slats
are combined with each other to produce a significant
graphic pattern for an observer on the entire blind.The graphic pattern forming region is a region
formed of a light-shielding paint or film, and the
significant graphic pattern is a graphic pattern which is
formed on the entire blind when the graphic pattern
forming regions of individual slats are combined to give
the observer in the interior space some

<CLAIMS>
A blind (1) having parallel slats (3) angularly movable simultaneously about
their own longitudinal axes, wherein each slat (3) has a graphic pattern forming region

(16) on a base board (3a) of transparent material, said base board (3a) having, in its
cross section transverse to the longitudinal axis thereof, a central surface (24), a first

bent surface (20) bent obliquely upward from one edge of the central surface (24), and a
second bent surface (23) bent obliquely downward from the other edge, said graphic

pattern forming regions (16) of the respective slats (3) are arranged to be combined
with each other to produce a significant graphic pattern (18) for an observer on the

entire blind (1) when the slats are angularly moved and tilted to a predetermined angle,
characterised in that

   each of said graphic pattern forming regions (16) comprises a highlighted
surface for blocking and strongly reflecting the light on a portion of a surface of the base board

(3a), thereby said significant graphic pattern (18) is observed when the light coming
from a front side of the blind (1) is reflected by the graphic pattern forming regions (16)

and said significant graphic pattern (18) is projected onto a floor or wall surface when
the light coming from behind the blind (1) is blocked by the graphic pattern forming

regions (16).
A blind according to claim 1, wherein each of said first (20) and second (23)
bent surfaces comprises a transparent pouched double-wall portion with an open side

end, and a graphic pattern piece (26) having a shape corresponding to a graphic pattern
forming region (16) which is to be borne by each of said first (20) and second (23) bent

surfaces, is removably inserted into the pouched double-wall portion.
A blind according to claim 2, wherein said base board (3a) comprises a flattened
tubular member. 
A blind according to claim 1, wherein each of said first (20) and second (23)
bent surfaces comprises a transparent pouched double-wall portion with an open side

end, and an insert (26) of a transparent base board having a graphic pattern forming
region (16) which is to be borne by each of said first (20) and second (23) bent surfaces,

is removably inserted into the pouched double-wall portion.
A blind according to claim 4, wherein said base board (3a) comprises a flattened
tubular member.
A blind according to claim 1, wherein said highlighted surface includes a
diffused-reflection surface composed of fine irregularities.
A blind according to claim 1, wherein said second bent surface (23) has a distal
edge closer to a centre than the junction between said central surface (24) and said

second bent surface (23).
A blind according to claim 1, wherein said first bent surface (20) projects
substantially perpendicularly upward on one side of said central surface (24), and said

second bent surface (23) projects substantially perpendicularly downward on an
opposite side of said central surface (24).
