<ABSTRACT>
In a prior art tank venting valve, especially with pulsed control of an electromagnet adjusting the position of the tank venting valve, undesirable operating noises can arise owing to contact between relatively moving metal components, and this is to be prevented. The valve closer (37) has at least one damper (35) which axially completely passes through the valve closer (37) and forms a first damping surface (40) directed towards the valve seat (27) on the first face (38) of the valve closer (37) and a second damping surface (41) directed towards the electromagnet (13)  on the second face (39) of the valve closer (37) so as to prevent or damp any impact of the valve close (37) on the valve seat (27) or on the magnet core (15). The tank venting valve of the invention is suitable for the metered supply of vaporised fuel from the fuel tank of a compressed-mixture, spark ignition internal combustion engine to one of its inlet pipes.

Valve for the metered introduction of fuel
evaporated from the fuel tank of an internal combustion

engine into an induction duct of the internal
combustion engine, having a valve closing element which

is arranged between a valve seat body and a magnet core
of an electromagnet, which valve seat body has a

passage opening, through which evaporated fuel flows in
an opened valve position, and has a first end surface

directed towards the valve seat body and a second end
surface directed towards the electromagnet and which is

acted on by a valve closing spring in the valve closing
direction and can be actuated by the electromagnet in

the valve opening direction, its first end surface
being held pressed against at least one valve seat,

with at least one valve opening, configured on the
valve seat body when no current is supplied to the

electromagnet and taking up a valve open position when
increasing current is supplied to the electromagnet,

and at least one damper element (35) being provided on
the valve closing element (37), which damper element

(35) protrudes in the axial direction through the valve
closing element (37) and forms a first damping surface

(40) directed towards the valve seat body (27) on the
first end surface (38) of the valve closing element

(37) and forms a second damping surface (41) which is
provided directly on that section of the damper element

(35) which protrudes in the axial direction through the 
valve closing element (37), and is directed towards the

electromagnet (13) on the second end surface (39) of
the valve closing element (37), its first damping

surface (40) being in contact with the at least one
valve seat (32) when no current is supplied to the

electromagnet (13) and its second damping surface (41)
being in contact with a stop surface (55) when

sufficient current is supplied to the electromagnet
(13), the damping effect of the damper element (35)

being obtained by internal friction when the damper
element (35) is deformed because of an impact.
Valve according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the first damping surface (41) of the damper
element (35) extends over a partial region (36) of the

first end surface (38) of the valve closing element
(37), which partial region is at least as large as the

valve seat (32) configured on the valve seat body (27)
so that the damper element (35) is pressed against the

valve seat body (27) by the valve closing spring (49)
and the valve closing element (37) when no current is

supplied to the electromagnet (13) and closes the at
least one valve opening (34) configured in the valve

seat body (27).
Valve according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 the valve closing spring (49) concentrically
encloses the magnet core (15) at least partially and

the damper element (35) extends in the axial direction,
starting from the first partial region (36), along a

boundary wall (52) of the passage opening (51) arranged
in the valve closing element (37) approximately as far

as the second end surface (39).
Valve according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 at least three passage holes (33) located at the
same distance from one another on a hypothetical circle

are configured in the valve closing element (37) and
the damper element (35) protrudes axially through each

of them starting from the first end surface (38), the
damper element (35) protruding in each case on the

second end surface (39) of the valve closing element 
(35) beyond the outer contour of the valve closing

element (37) and there forming partial damping surfaces
of the second damping surface (41) corresponding to the

number of passage holes (33).
Valve according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized
in that
 the stop surface (55) is formed by an end
surface (56) of the magnet core (15).
Valve according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized
in that
 the stop surface (55) is formed by a stop body
(54) connected to the magnet core (15).
Valve according to Claim 3, 
characterized in
that
 the stop body (54) is manufactured from nonmagnetic
material.
Valve according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the damper element (35) consists of rubber-type
material which is connected to the valve closing

element (37) by vulcanizing.
