<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydrogen
storage alloy which can electrochemically absorb and
desorb hydrogen in a reversible manner, and it also
relates to an electrode using said alloy.Storage batteries, which are widely used as
power sources in a variety of applications, are typically
classified into two general groups of lead-acid storage
batteries and alkaline storage batteries. Between the two
groups, alkaline storage batteries tend to be more
reliable, and can be made smaller and lighter. Small
alkaline storage batteries are generally favored for
portable electric appliances, while large alkaline storage
batteries have been used mainly in conjunction with
industrial equipments.While some alkaline storage batteries use, for
example, air electrode or silver oxide electrode for their
positive electrode, majority of the positive electrodes
are nickel electrodes. Nickel electrodes have been
particularly popular since they were reconfigured from a 
pocket type to a sintered type and became even more
popular with the development of hermetic-sealing.At present, cadmium is most commonly used to
form the negative electrode of alkaline storage batteries,
however other materials, including zinc, iron, hydrogen,
and the like have also been employed.There is considerable commercial interest in
storage batteries that have a higher energy density than
batteries currently available. Toward achieving this
goal, researchers have investigated nickel-hydrogen
storage batteries which incorporate metal hydride, i.e.,
hydrogen storage alloy electrodes. A number of proposals
have been made on the production method of the hydrogen
storage electrodes using metal hydrides.The alloys in these electrodes, or the hydrides
form of such alloys, can absorb and desorb hydrogen in a
reversible manner, and thus the alloys and the electrodes
made from these alloys have come to be known as hydrogen
storage alloys and hydrogen storage electrodes (or
hydrogen storage alloy electrodes), respectively.Batteries made with hydrogen storage electrodes
have a larger theoretical energy density compared to
batteries formed with cadmium electrodes. Also, batteries
that employ hydrogen storage electrodes are not
susceptible to the formation and subsequent deformation of
dendrites, which is a problem with zinc electrodes. These 
advantageous properties, as well as the promise for a
longer cycle life and a reduction in the environmental
concerns inherent in zinc- or cadmium- containing
electrodes/batteries, have encouraged research into
developing
