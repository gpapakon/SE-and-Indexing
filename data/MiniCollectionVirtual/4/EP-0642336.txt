<ABSTRACT>
This invention pertains to the novel use of anti-rheumatoid arthritic drugs in the treatment of dementia. A method of treating dementia in human beings characterized by administering to the human being a therapeutic amount of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which has the ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the human being.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the novel use of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of
dementia (Alzheimer disease) in human beings.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
are the drugs of choice for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis (Textbook of Rheumatology, eds. Kelley, W.N.,
Harris, E.D. Jr., Ruddy, S., Sledge, C.B., Saunders Co.,
1989). They have fewer side effects than other classes of
anti-arthritic drugs and are therefore almost universally
prescribed for this condition. They are characterized by
their ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis through
anti-cyclooxygenase activity. They can be classified
chemically as derivatives of arylcarboxylic acids, including
salicylic and anthranilic acid derivatives; arylalkanoic
acids, including arylacetic, arylpropionic,
heteroarylacetic, indoleacetic and indeneacetic acids; and
enolic acids, including pyrazolidinediones and oxicams.While drugs in this class are among the most
widely used in medicine, there is no literature or teaching
in the art to indicate that any NSAID has been used in the
treatment of Alzheimer's disease (dementia). This brain
disorder is estimated to affect 0.5-1% of the general
population in industrialized countries and threatens to
become more prevalent as the average age of the human
population increases.We have determined that patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, most of whom will have been treated with one or
more of these agents, have a much lower prevalence of
Alzheimer disease than the age-matched general population.
We have also determined in a 6 month pilot trial, and other
trials, that Alzheimer cases given indomethacin, a widely 
used NSAID, showed little or no mental deterioration.
NSAIDs are relatively safe agents. While they all have
side effects, such side effects are well known due to their
very extensive use in a wide range of inflammatory diseases
where long term treatment is common.The invention pertains to a method of treating
dementia in human beings characterized by administering to
the human being a therapeutic amount of a substance selected
from the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory group of
cyclooxygenase inhibitors.The invention also pertains to a composition for
treating dementia in human beings which composition is
characterized by a substance or substances selected from
the group consisting of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
cyclooxygenase inhibitors, therapeutically acceptable salts
thereof, and therapeutically acceptable carriers.Within the terms of the invention, the NSAIDs

<CLAIMS>
Use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory substance
which has the ability to inhibit protaglandin synthesis in

the human being in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical
formulation for the treatment of dementia in a human being.
The use as claimed in claims 1 wherein the
substance is selected from a derivative of arylcarboxylic

acids, arylalkanoic acids and enolic acids, and
therapeutically acceptable salts thereof.
The use as claimed in claims 1 wherein the
arylcarboxylic acid is a salicylic acid or an anthranilic

acid derivative; the arylalkanoic acid is arylacetic,
arylpropionic, heteroarylacetic, indoleacetic or indeneacetic

acid; and the enolic acid is pyrazolidinedione or oxicam, and
therapeutically acceptable salts thereof. 
The use as claimed in claims 1 wherein the
substance is salicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid,

The use as claimed in claims 1 wherein the
substance is indomethacin.
The use as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the
substance is administrable in an amount required to inhibit

effectively prostaglandin synthesis in vivo but avoid
inducing unwanted side effects such as gastrointestinal

bleeding.
The use as claimed in claim 6 wherein the daily
dosage is from 10 mg to 3 g of substance per 100 kg of body

weight of the human being.
