<ABSTRACT>
A copolymer obtainable by polymerisation (1st step) of 1-99% by weight of a monomer mixture A) comprising     50-100% by weight of at least one C1-C16alkyl (meth)acrylate a) 0-40% by weight of at least one vinyl aromatic compound having up to 20 carbon atoms b), 0-30% by weight of at least one nonaromatic diolefin having up to 8 carbon atoms c),   0-40% by weight of at least one further monomer d), where the proportion by weight of b) and c) together is at most 49% by weight, and subsequent polymerisation (2nd step) of 1-99% by weight of a monomer mixture B) comprising   50-100% by weight of a mixture of at least one of each of monomers b) and c),   0-40% by weight of at least one monomer a) and   0-40% by weight of at least one monomer d), in the presence of the polymer obtained from A), where the percentages by weight of the monomer mixtures A) and B) are based on the copolymer built up in at least two steps.
