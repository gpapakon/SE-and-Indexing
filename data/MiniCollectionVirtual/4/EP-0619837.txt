<ABSTRACT>
A reiterative method for obtaining the glycosyltransferases useful for glycosyltransferase-catalyzed synthesis of a saccharide composition by serially bonding preselected saccharide units onto an immobilized acceptor moiety which is one member selected from the group consisting of proteins, glycoproteins, lipids, glycolipids and carbohydrates. The method comprises in a first iteration, the steps of (i) contacting an acceptor moiety immobilized onto a solid or semi-solid support with a mixture containing at least one glycosyltransferase under conditions effective to allow said glycosyltransferase to bind to the immobilized acceptor moiety thereby resulting in an immobilized acceptor moiety-glycosyltransferase complex, followed by (ii) contacting the immobilized acceptor moiety-glycosyltransferase complex with a preselected saccharide under conditions and in the presence of co-reagents sufficient to effect bonding of the preselected saccharide unit onto the immobilized acceptor moiety catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase thereby freeing the glycosyltransferase from the complex and obtaining an immobilized product. This is followed by a single or a plurality of subsequent iterations of steps (i) and (ii), such that the immobilized product obtained in step (ii) of a given iteration is used as the immobilized acceptor moiety in step (i) of the following iteration, until the target saccharide composition is obtained, and all of the required glycosyltransferases are also thereby obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
Portions of this invention were supported by National
Science Foundation Grant DCB8817883.This application is a continuation-in-part of application
serial nos. 07/509,560 and 07/683,810, filed April 16, 1990, and
April 12, 1991, respectively, and relates to subject matter
disclosed in copending U.S. Patent Application serial Number
07/241,012, filed September 2, 1988. Serial Number 07/241,012 is
incorporated herein by reference.This invention relates to saccharide compositions such as,
for example, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, glycolipids, and
glycoproteins. More specifically, this invention relates to
processes for preparing these and other saccharide compositions
by enzymatic techniques.The term "carbohydrate" embraces a wide variety of chemical
compounds having the general formula (CH2O)n, such as
monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and
polysaccharides. Oligosaccharides are chains composed of
saccharide units, which are alternatively known as sugars. These
saccharide units can be arranged in any order and the linkage
between two saccharide units can occur in any of approximately
ten different ways. As a result, the number of different
possible stereoisomeric oligosaccharide chains is enormous.Of all the biological polymer families, oligosaccharides and
polysaccharides have been the least well studied, due in 
considerable part to the difficulty of sequencing and
synthesizing their often complex sugar chains. Although the
syntheses of oligonucleotides and polypeptides are well
developed, there is currently no generally applicable synthetic
technique for synthesizing oligosaccharides.Numerous classical techniques for the synthesis of
carbohydrates have been developed, but these techniques suffer
the difficulty of requiring selective protection and
deprotection. Organic synthesis of oligosaccharides is further
hampered by the lability of many glycosidic bonds, difficulties
in achieving regio-selective sugar coupling, and generally low
synthetic yields. These difficulties, together with the
difficulties of isolating and purifying carbohydrates and of
analyzing their structures, has made this area of chemistry a
most demanding one.Much research effort has been devoted to carbohydrates and
molecules comprising carbohydrate fragments, such as glycolipids
and glycoproteins. Research interest in such moieties has been
largely due to the recognition that interactions between proteins
and carbohydrates are involved in a wide array of biological
recognition events, including fertilization,

A plurality of preselected, homogeneous
glycosyltransferases, each of which is specific for an

acceptor moiety and a donor moiety, said plurality of
preselected glycosyltransferases being capable of

synthesizing a saccharide composition selected from the
group consisting of:


(i) β-D-Galp-(1→4)-[α-L-Fucp-(1→3)]-β-D-Glcp-NAc-(1→3)-β-D-Galp-(1→4)-D-Glc;
(ii) β-D-Galp-(1→4)-β-D-Glcp-(1→3)-β-D-Galp-(1→4)-D-Glc;
(iii) β-D-Galp-(1→3)-β-D-Glcp-NAc-(1→3)-β-D-Galp-(1→4)-D-Glc;
(iv) α-D-NeuNAc-(2→3)-β-D-Galp-(1→4)-β-D-Galp-NAc;
and
(v) β-D-Galp-NAc- (1→4) -β-D-Galp- (1→4) -D-Glc;

said plurality of preselected, homogeneous
glycosyltransferases being obtainable by a method

comprising:

(a) contacting an acceptor moiety immobilized on a
solid or semi-solid support with a mixture of

glycosyltransferases under conditions suitable to effect
bonding of the glycosyltransferases to the acceptor moiety,

thereby forming immobilized acceptor moiety-glycosyltransferase
complexes;
(b) eluting one of the preselected glycosyltransferases
from the immobilized complexes by contacting the immobilized

complexes with a donor moiety comprising a preselected
saccharide unit under conditions suitable to effect the

glycosyltransferase-catalyzed transfer of the preselected
saccharide unit from the donor moiety to the immobilized

acceptor moiety and release of the preselected
glycosyltransferase from the complexes, thereby forming an

immobilized product;
(c) collecting the released preselected
glycosyltransferase; and 
(d) repeating steps (a), (b) and (c) such that
each time said steps are repeated, the immobilized product

obtained in step (b) functions as the acceptor moiety of step
(a), and after the last time said steps are repeated, the

immobilized product of step (b) becomes a saccharide
composition selected from said group.
