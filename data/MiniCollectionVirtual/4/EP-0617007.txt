from diacetylene and secondary amines, which comprises 


a) separating off by absorption from the cleavage gas 
resulting during acetylene generation a part stream 

which contains diacetylene of the formula II 

H-C≡C-C≡C-H
 
and 
b) reacting this part stream with secondary amines of 
the general formula III 


 
where R
1
 and R

 have the abovementioned meanings,  
 

and water, if appropriate in a diluent at from 0 to 
150°C and from 0.01 to 5 bar. 
A process for preparing 1-aminovinyl methyl 
ketones I as claimed in claim 1, wherein the absorption 

is carried out reversibly in a polar liquid and dilution 
is carried out, if appropriate, with an inert gas. 
A process for preparing 1-aminovinyl methyl 
ketones I as claimed in claim 1, wherein the proportion 

of diacetylene in the dilute part stream during the 
reaction with the secondary amines III is from 2 to 30% 

by volume.
