<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a compacted, granular sodium
silicate having an SiO
2
/Na
2
O molar ratio of 1.7 : 1
to 4.1 : 1, in particular of 2 : 1 to 3.5 : 1,

characterized in that it comprises first intimately
mixing a sodium silicate having a median particle

diameter of 
<
 500 µm with a material increasing its
hardness, this being at least one substance from the

group consisting of water, silica sol, silica gel,
nonionic, anionic or cationic surfactants, water

glass, liquid or dried water glass solutions, maleic
acid and/or acrylic acid and polymers and copolymers

thereof, before converting it into pressed granules
having particle sizes of 0.1 to 5 mm by compacting,

comminution and screening.
The process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the material increasing the hardness of the

sodium silicate is added to the sodium silicate in
an amount of up to 5 % by weight.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that, after production of the pressed

granules, the sodium silicate is first mechanically
rounded. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the pressed granules are

additionally coated with the material increasing
their hardness in an amount of up to 6 % by weight,

relative to the sodium silicate.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the conversion into

pressed granules is carried out at temperatures of
15 to 180°C.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 5, characterized in that the additional coating

of the pressed granules with the material increasing
their hardness is carried out at a temperature of

between 15 and 130°C.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 6, characterized in that granulation of the

sodium silicate is carried out on a roll compactor
in combination with integrated comminution of the

flakes formed.
