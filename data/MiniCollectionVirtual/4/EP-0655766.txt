<ABSTRACT>
Display tube comprising a deflection unit provided with a (twist) 
correction device which comprises an annular (twist) correction coil surrounding the 

tube neck, which coil, when energized by a circuit providing a (twist) correction 
current, generates a magnetic correction field in the axial direction of the display tube. 

According to the invention, the device also provides a 4-pole y field for correcting 
(twist) errors in the centre of the display screen. This 4-pole y field can be generated by 

causing the turns of the annular coil to follow a path having four predetermined 
corrugations alternately facing the display screen and the electron gun.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display tube comprising a display screen and a 
neck accommodating an electron gun system for emitting an electron beam towards the 
display screen, and a deflection unit coaxially surrounding the display tube, which 
deflection unit comprises a line deflection coil system which, when energized, deflects 
the electron beam in a first direction and a field deflection coil system which, when 
energized, deflects the electron beam in a second direction transverse to the first 
direction, said deflection unit further comprising an annular correction coil which 
surrounds the path of the electron beam, is arranged transversely to the longitudinal axis 
of the tube and is connectable to a circuit providing a correction current for generating 
a correction magnetic field in the axial direction of the display tube. The invention also relates to a display tube comprising a display screen 
and a neck accommodating an electron gun system for emitting an electron beam 
towards the display screen, and a deflection unit coaxially surrounding the display tube, 
which deflection unit comprises a line deflection coil system which, when energized, 
deflects the electron beam in a first direction and a field deflection coil which, when 
energized, deflects the electron beam in a second direction transverse to the first 
direction, said deflection unit further comprising an annular correction coil which 
surrounds the path of the electron beam, is arranged transversely to the longitudinal axis 
of the tube and is connected to a circuit for providing a correction current for 
generating a correction magnetic field in the axial direction of the display tube. A display tube of the types mentioned in the first and second paragraph is 
known from United States Patent 4,296,359. The invention relates to both monochrome display tubes in which one 
electron beam is generated, and to colour display tubes in which three electron beams 
are generated. In colour display tubes of the in-line type, the electron gun system is 
adapted to generate three coplanar electron beams which converge on the display  
 
screen. The deflection unit surrounding the display tube for deflecting the electron 
beams is used for deflecting the electron beams from their normal undeflected straight 
path into the one or the other direction so that the beams impinge upon selected pixels 
on the display screen on which they provide visual indications. By suitably varying the 
magnetic deflection fields, the electron beams can be
