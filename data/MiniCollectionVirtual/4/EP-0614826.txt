<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a stackable packaging end cap for lamp housings, which cap can be fitted in a positive-locking manner onto the end face of the lamp housings in order thus to be able to stack a multiplicity of lamp housings adjacently and one above the other, said lamp housings holding each other together without further aids. For this purpose, lateral hooks (16a, 16b) are attached in each case to the packaging end caps (1), which hooks come into engagement with assigned hooks (16) of adjacent packaging end caps located next to one another. Furthermore, there are upper and lower centring means (10, 19, 20) on the packaging end cap, with which centring means the packaging end cap comes into positive-locking engagement with the packaging end cap located above and below it.

A stackable packing end cap for light housings, with a front side and side 
walls formed thereon in one piece of material, which side walls are constructed 

at least partially so as to be able to be pushed in a form-fitting manner onto the 
front side of the light housings, characterised in that lateral hooks (16) are 

formed on the packing end caps (1), which hooks (16) are able to be engaged 
with associated hooks of adjacent packing end caps lying adjacent to each other. 
A packing end cap according to Claim 1, characterised in that upper and 
lower centerings (10, 19, 20) are provided, which come into form-fitting 

engagement with packing end caps lying thereabove and therebeneath. 
A packing end cap according to Claim 1, characterised in that the hooks 
(16) are arranged on opposite sides, in which in each case hooks (16a, 16b) lying 

opposite each other are directed in opposite directions. 
A packing end cap according to Claim 3, characterised in that hooks are 
provided which are opened in the direction towards the longitudinal axis of the 

light (3). 
A packing end cap according to Claim 3, characterised in that the hooks 
(10) are constructed so as to be directed in a direction perpendicularly to the 

longitudinal axis of the light. 
A packing end cap according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
centerings (10, 19, 20) are constructed acting both in the direction of the 

longitudinal axis of the light and also in the direction transversely to the 
longitudinal axis of light (3).  

 
A packing end cap according to Claim 1, characterised in that the hooks 
(16a, 16b) are arranged in the region of a recess (19) projecting back from the 

remaining side wall. 
A packing end cap according to one of Claims 1 - 6, characterised in that 
guide surfaces (5, 6) are provided on the hooks (16a, 16b), which are 

constructed on at least one part of the side walls, on which a sliding along takes 
place, in order to hook into each other the hooks (16) of associated packing end 

caps lying adjacent to each other. 
Packing end caps according to Claim 8, characterised in that the guide 
surfaces are formed as a guide slope (6) and/or guide rib (5), in which the guide 

ribs (5) point in the direction of the hooks (16), in order to thus make possible 
an introduction movement onto the hooks (16) during stacking. 
A packing end cap according to Claim 1, characterised in that at least 
parts in the front region of the light housing are received in a form-fitting 

manner by the packing end cap (1). 
A packing end cap according to Claim 1, characterised in that in the 
packing end cap (1) barbs (21) are constructed, which ensure an engagement 

with the light. 
A packing end cap according to one of Claims 1 - 11, characterised in 
that several packing end caps (1) lying adjacent to each other are connected in 

one piece of material to a packing end cap (30) for multiple light housings. 
A packing end cap according to one of Claims 1 - 12, characterised in 
that the packing end caps (1) are fixed on the light housing in a positionally 

correct manner with a foil which is wound both around the light housing and  
 

also at least partially over the packing end caps (1). 
A packing end cap according to one of Claims 1 - 13, characterised in 
that the packing end cap is produced from polyethylene. 
A packing end cap according to Claim 13, characterised in that the foil 
consists of the same material as the packing end cap (1). 
A packing end cap according to Claim 1, characterised in that in 
particular the front wall (4) of the packing end cap (1) is able to be written 

upon directly by inkjet printing, tampon printing or the like.
