<ABSTRACT>
A code-division multiple-access spread-spectrum 
communication system uses pairs of spreading codes with 

rates of N/2 chips per data symbol to provide a capacity 
equivalent to that obtained in a conventional system with N 

chips per symbol. In the transmitter, identical input data 
are spread in parallel by both spreading codes, then used to 

modulate two orthogonal carrier signals, and the resulting 
radio-frequency signals are combined for transmission from 

an antenna. In the receiver, the received signal is 
demodulated by parallel multiplication with the two carrier 

signals, the resulting baseband signals are correlated with 
the two spreading codes, and the results are added.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to code-division multiple-access 
(hereinafter, CDMA) spread-spectrum communications, more 
particularly to a method and apparatus for increasing the 
number of users who can transmit simultaneously without 
increasing the bandwidth requirement. CDMA is a digital communication system that allows 
multiple users to communicate in the same frequency band. 
Briefly, each user's data is modulated by a different 
spreading code having a rate of N chips per data symbol (N 
being an integer greater than one), and all user's data are 
transmitted on the same carrier frequency. A receiver can 
recover a particular user's transmitted data by demodulating 
the received signal with that user's spreading code. If the spreading codes are all mutually orthogonal over 
each symbol duration, then the demodulated signals will be 
free of interference. The number of mutually orthogonal 
spreading codes available depends on the chip rate N: the 
higher the value of N, the more orthogonal codes there are. 
If the spreading codes are only approximately orthogonal, 
then the number of different codes that can be used before 
interference causes an unacceptably high error rate depends  
 
similarly on N. In either case, higher values of N allow 
more users to transmit simultaneously; that is, higher 
values of N provide more user channels. Accordingly, a simple way to accommodate more users in 
a CDMA system is to increase the chip rate. Unfortunately, 
this also increases the bandwidth of the transmitted CDMA 
signal. Operators of CDMA systems that have a fixed 
bandwidth allocation, such as digital cellular telephone 
systems, face the dilemma of needing to increase their user 
capacity without being able to increase their bandwidth. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to 
increase the user capacity of a CDMA communication system 
without requiring extra bandwidth. The invention provides a method of transmitting and 
receiving symbol data in a CDMA spread-spectrum 
communication system, and a transmitter and receiver 
employing this method. The method comprises the steps of:
 
   spreading identical input symbol data by two spreading 
codes to generate two baseband transmit signals;
 
   generating two mutually orthogonal carrier signals;
 
   modulating these two carrier signals by the two 
baseband transmit signals to generate two radio-frequency 
signals;
 
 
   combining the two radio-frequency signals into a single 
radio-frequency signal, and transmitting this signal from a 
trans
