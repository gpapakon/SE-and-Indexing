A process for electrocoating of metal cans open at one end 
with subsequent drying, characterized in that each can is 

led through an electrocoating bath and in the course of 
this, in a period of more than 3 to less than 60 seconds, 

is coated with a wet film having a film electrical 
resistivity of at least 0.6 x 10⁸ ohm x cm depositing on its 

surface, the can being dipped into the bath in one 
continuous operation with its opening pointing obliquely 

downwards, moved when submerged in the bath so that its 
opening points upwards, and then, with its opening pointing 

downwards, lifted out of the bath and then led by a 
continuous means of transportation through one or several 

drying ovens, several cans simultaneously being coated and 
dried, beside each other and distanced from each other, and 

a mounting on a transporting element provided for the 
individual cans being electrically connected as an 

electrode for electrocoating, while auxiliary counter-electrodes, 
insertable into the individual cans and lying 

at a distance from the inside wall of the cans exceeding 
half the radius of the cans, are used. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
cans are led through the bath on a path in the form of a 

circular arc. 
A process according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that during the coating the cans are held by their open 

end on a transporting element leading them through the 
bath. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the cans are initially beaded at their open end, 

then washed, subsequently coated and finally dried and 
optionally labelled or printed.  

 
A process according to claim 4, characterized in that after 
coating and before drying the cans are rinsed with water. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that after lifting out of the bath the 

cans are put, distanced from each other, on a continuous 
means of transportation leading through one or several 

drying ovens. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that, after washing, the cans are first lacquered 

externally on the body and dried aid then their bottom and 
interior are coated in the electrocoating bath. 
A process according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
cans are printed on the body with one or several printing 

inks that are essentially non-conductors of electricity and 
then coated in the electrocoating bath. 
A process according to claim 8, characterized in that 5 to 
95 % of the body of the can is printed pictorially with at 

least one printing ink in offset or screen printing and 
dried, with production of an imprint which after drying is 

resistant in the electrocoating bath with a film specific 
resistivity of more than 10⁷ ohm x cm in the whole area of 

the print image, onto which a differently-coloured or 
transparent coating is applied in the electrocoating bath.
