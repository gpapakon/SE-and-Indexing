<ABSTRACT>
A needle assembly for evacuated blood collection tubes or 
containers comprises a single needle cannula, a needle cannula support 

made of a translucent or transparent material provided on the middle 
portion of the needle cannula, a blood flow confirmation passage formed 

in the interior of the needle cannula support and communicating with 
one end of the needle cannula, said ending being covered with an 

elastomeric resilient cap, and an air-permeable, blood repellant plug 
provided at an opening end of the passage. With the needle assembly 

its operability can be improved, its structure is simplified hardly to 
be impaired in use and can be manufactured at low cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a needle assembly for evacuated
blood collection tubes or containers, one end of which needle is
inserted into the vein of a blood examinee, and the other end is
communicated with the interior of a vacuum, blood collecting container
so as to be able to collect blood in an amount responsive to the
negative pressure in said container.A needle assembly for evacuated blood collection tubes or containers
of this kind is known from DE-C-3229783. This assembly is illustrated
in FIG. 1 of the attached drawings. Therein a needle cannula support A is
secured to the middle portion of a stainless needle cannula B, and one
end of the needle cannula support A is provided with a rubber cap C for
covering the one end of the needle cannula B. With such kind of needle
assembly, the other end i.e. the tip of the needle cannula B is
inserted into the vein of a blood examinee in collecting blood, and a
blood collection container is fitted from one end of the needle cannula
B while covering the one end with the rubber cap C and communicating
with the interior of the blood collection container whereafter it can
be confirmed for the first time whether the needle has accurately
entered the vein of the blood examinee. This needs a plurality of
insertions to give a discomfort to the blood examinee or to release the
negative pressure pre-set to the blood collection container so that it
becomes unable to collect a desired amount of blood or it becomes
necessary to use other blood collection tubes.To remove such demerits, a variety of needle assemblies have 
been proposed that are constructed in such a way that when inserted
into the vein of the blood examinee a flow-out of blood can be
confirmed. One known example is such that a needle cannula is divided
into two sections, one of which is to be inserted into the vein and the
other to be inserted into a vacuum blood collection container, a member
of connecting these two needle sections is provided with a transparent
blood flow passage, and it is confirmed through this passage whether
the blood is flowing or not. Alternative known example is such that
the middle portion of a needle cannula is bored with a hole which is
circumferentially formed with a blood flow confirmation chamber.To refer to a needle assembly where the needle cannula is
constituted by two needle sections, of the known needle assemblies for
evacuated blood collection tubes so far proposed, the member of
connecting the two needle sections requires a lot of components whereby

<CLAIMS>
A needle assembly for use with an evacuated blood collection container
to draw blood from a blood examinee, said needle assembly comprising: a

needle cannula (1), a first end (1a) of which is suitable for insertion into the vein
of a blood examinee and a second obliquely cut end (1b) having a tip edge and a rear side

of which is suitable for
insertion into a vacuum blood collection container which is sealingly attachable to

said needle cannula for forming a communication with the interior of the vacuum
blood collection container; a needle cannula support (2) mounted at the middle

portion of the needle cannula (1), such that said first end (1a) of said needle
cannula (1) extends outwardly from and is liquid tightly fixed to a first side of said

support and said second end (1b) of said needle cannula (1) extends outwardly
from an opposite second side of said support; and an elastomeric resilient cap (8)

mounted on the support (2) over said second end (1b) of said needle cannula (1);
wherein said support (2) is a single body made of a translucent or transparent

material, and wherein said support (2) is provided with a longitudinal passage (4)
which is opened toward said opposite second side of the support (2), and extends

along the outer periphery of the needle cannula (1) up to an inner end within said
support (2), and is further provided with a radial passage (5) extending radially

across said longitudinal passage (4) and communicating with the outside, at least
one air permeable, liquid repellent plug (6; 10; 11; 12) being anchored in said

radial passage (5), characterized in that
the tip edge of the obliquely cut end face is cut at both its sides from the rear side so

that
the second end (1b) of said needle

cannula (1) has a sharpened point which lies in a plane including the axis of the
needle cannula (1) and is positioned between the axis of the needle cannula and

the outer surface of the needle cannula (1).
A needle assembly as set forth in claim 1, wherein the side wall of said
longitudinal passage (4) is in partial contact with the outer surface of the needle

cannula (1). 
A needle assembly as set forth in claim 1, wherein said longitudinal
passage (4) in the needle cannula support (2) has a circular cross section and is

formed around the needle cannula (1).
A needle assembly as set forth in claim 2, wherein the longitudinal
passage (4) in the needle cannula support (2) has an oval shape cross section.
A needle assembly as set forth in claim 1 or 2, wherein the longitudinal
passage (4) in the needle cannula (1) comprises a plurality of passages (4a, 4b,

4c, 4d) extending lengthwise along the outer periphery of the needle cannula (1).
A needle assembly as set forth in one of more of the preceding claims,
wherein said air-permeable, liquid repellent plug (8) is made of a synthetic

resinous mass.
A needle assembly as set forth in one of more of the preceding claims,
wherein the inner edge of the end of said radial passage which opens to the

outside is tapered outwardly.
A needle assembly as set forth in one of more of the preceding claims,

wherein the needle cannula support consists of a single molding.
