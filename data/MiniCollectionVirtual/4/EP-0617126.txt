<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a peptide which
inhibits the binding of human IL-6 (interleukin-6) to human
IL-6 receptor, to a polypeptide consisting essentially of the
V-regions of the H-variable region of the H-chain and the L-chain
of an anti-IL-6 antibody, to a human IL-6 suppressant, an
anti-inflammatory agent, an immunosuppressant or an
anti-autoimmune disease drug containing the above peptide, to a
gene which codes for the above peptide, to a plasmid carrying
the above gene, to a transformant carrying the above plasmid,
and to a method for the production of the above peptide by
culturing the above transformant.Human IL-6 is a substance whose gene was.isolated in
1986 (Nature, Vol.324, p.73, 1986), and it is produced by a
number of different cells, including monocytes, T cells, B
cells, vascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and the like,
and is known to have a variety of physiological effects, such
as the induction of the differentiation of B-cells into
antibody-producing cells, the induction of acute phase protein
synthesis by liver cells, the induction of the differentiation
of cerebral nerve cells, the induction of the proliferation and
differentiation of hematopoietic cells, etc. (Jikken Igaku,
Vol.7, No.1, 1989).Also, attention is being given to the participation of
human IL-6 in various diseases, and many reports have been
published in regard thereto.First, reports regarding its participation in
autoimmune diseases, include a report that the human IL-6
concentration in the synovial fluid of chronic arthritic
rheumatism patients is an extremely high value in comparison
with that of osteoarthritis patients (European Journal of
Immunology, Vol.18, p.1797, 1988), that autoimmune disease
symptoms were improved by removing the primary tumors of
cardiac myxoma patients which constitutively produce IL-6
(Proceedings of National Academy of Science, U.S.A., Vol.84,
p.228, 1987), and that in the case of Castleman's disease which 
is characterized by high γ-globulinemia, a high concentration of
human IL-6 was detected in the supernatant of affected lymph
node tissue cultures (Jikken Igaku, Vol.7, p.50, 1989), etc.,
and of the so-called autoimmune diseases of which auto-antibody
production is thought to be a cause or aggravator, those with
which IL-6 is strongly connected are thought to be the most
dominant.Furthermore, in the area of cancer, tumor cells taken
from multiple myeloma patients constitutively produce IL-6, and
their growth is further promoted by adding IL-6 thereto, which
has led to a
