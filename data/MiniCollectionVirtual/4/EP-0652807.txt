<ABSTRACT>
For processing oil-containing operating materials at least the shredded metal and/or plastic parts are centrifuged (23) in order to separate the oil (24) which adheres thereto. Any oil on residual materials that are entrained can be removed in a screw press (29).

Method for recovering upgradable waste oil, metal raw
material and synthetic material from extremely oil-loaded

operating materials, in particular of oil, metals and
synthetic materials from industrial wastes by previous

assortment and separation of the charged operation
material in particular synthetic and metal fractions as

well as a third fraction which contains the rest material
freed from fault materials, following the com
minution of
parts contained in the synthetic and metal fraction, and

the mechanical separation of oil from these parts and its
recovering, whereby a separate deposition of oil from the

rest material is made by dripping off and/or by pressing,
characterised in that

the mechanical separation of oil from the synthetic and
metal fraction occurs in centrifuges by centrifuging

whereby the centrifuges and/or the presses are connected
with an oil collecting device.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
metals and the metal-containing parts are subjected to a

metal separating process in a magnet separator or in an
eddy current separator after the centrifuging operation

and/or are lead to a further metal separator after the
centrifuging operation by a swinging conduit.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the metal-containing pieces and the metals are lead to a

shredding comminution, preferably through a two-step
shredding comminution, whereby at the first step the

metal-containing pieces and metals are cut into stripes of
maximal 30 mm width, preferably maximal 20 mm width and at

the second step are comminuted to a grain size of maximal 
25 mm, preferably maximal 20 mm, whereby preferably the

pieces cut in longitudinal stripes are adjusted in
longitudinal direction before comminution and after that

are cut at right angles to the longitudinal direction.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the feed or in previous assortment transpired

synthetic materials are comminuted in a shredder before
centrifuging, preferably at a maximum grain fraction of

25 mm and/or that the synthetic material parts are washed
after centrifuging and then directly be comminuted further

in a synthetic material exploitation or a wet cutting
mill.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the synthetic material after being washed and if

applicable further comminuted is lead to a floating-sink-elimination
and wherein impurities, PVC, PET, and PS are

separated from Polyolephine PE and PP, whereby preferably
Polyolephine as a swimming substance is skimmed off, dried

and lead to regranulation.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that the neither metal parts nor synthetic material

representing rest material is lead over a gathering
assembly overflow of a worm press for oil trapping.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that the transpired partly muddy oil extracted from

comminution (shredding) and/or of the worm press or by
transferring or by dripping off at a dripping place, is

lead to a precipation tank whereby preferably at
periodically temporal intervals the swamp of the

precipation tank is taken off and lead to the centrifuge. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised
in that centrifuging is made with a maximum mesh size of

60 µm.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised
in that the non-metallic rest material separated in one or

more metal-separator(s) is lead to a worm press for oil
trapping or last oil trapping.
Device for recovering upgradable waste oil, metal raw
material and synthetic material of extremely oil-loaded or

oil-containing operating materials with a charging place
(10), a gathering assembly (13) for separating the charged

operating material (10) into a metal fraction (15), a
synthetic fraction (14) and a third fraction which

contains the rest material freed from interfering
material, just as tandem-arranged a metal separator (20),

at least a shredder (21, 22) and a centrifuge (23) for
treatment of the metal fraction (15), for treatment of the

synthetic material fraction (14) respectively tandem-arranged
a shredder (40), a centrifuge (42) and a washing

drum (43), and for treatment of the rest material a worm
press (29), whereby the shredders (20, 21, and 40), the

centrifuges (23, 42) and the worm press (29) in each case
are connected with oil collecting devices (25, 32, 34).
Device according to claim 10, characterised in that the
centrifuge (23) is continuously working and/or has a mesh

width of maximal 60 µm.
Device according to claim 10 or 11, characterised in that
two shredder (21, 22) are tandem-arranged before the

centrifuge (23) whereby the first one (21) cuts the
charged material in longitudinal stripes and the shown off

adjustment device for the longitudinal stripes leads them 
correctly adjusted to the second shredder (22) where they

get cross-cut, and/or that after the centrifuge (23) are
tandem-arranged a swinging conduit (26) and a further

metal-separator (27).
Device according to one of the claims 10 to 12,
characterised in that for treatment of synthetic material

parts a shredder (40), a centrifuge (42), a wash drum
(43), a wet cutting mill (44), a swimming-sink-separator

(45), and a drier (46) are tandemly arranged.
Device according to one of the claims 10 to 13,
characterised in that the shredder (21, 22, 40) and the

snail press (29) and/or the reading assembly (13) and/or a
separate dripping place, preferably connected by a

combined oil settling tank (32), whereby preferably the
oil settling tank (32) is equipped with a swamp outlet

device on the bottom through that the swamp is lead to the
centrifuge (23).
