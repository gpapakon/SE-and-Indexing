<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for conveying a flexible sheet of material (8), such as a web of container labels, has two cylindrical drums, a first drum (23) including a respective drive means, and the second (30) drum being movable by a drive coupling (32, 34) connected to the drive means, wherein the surface speed of the second drum (30) does not equal the surface speed of the first drum (23) and the flexible sheet of material (8) is transferred from the slower moving drum (30) to the faster moving drum (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus for conveying a 
flexible sheet of material and in particular, labels 
for attachment to a container. Conventionally, labelling machines use a series of 
rotating drums for the transport of labels through a 
series of stages. The labels are transferred from the 
surface of one drum to the surface of the next drum, 
and the labels are generally held on the surface of the 
drums by a vacuum. The drums are rotated so that the 
surface velocities of the drums are the same (see for instance 
GB-A-952 473). However, due to variances in the surface speeds the 
labels may be wrinkled or creased as they are 
transferred from one drum to the next if the surface 
velocity of the receiving drum drops below the surface 
velocity of the drum from which the label is being 
transferred. This is obviously undesirable as it may 
result in creased labels on the final product. In accordance with the present invention, apparatus for 
conveying a flexible sheet of material comprises first 
and second movable surfaces adjacent to each other and  
 
adapted to transfer the sheet of material directly from one 
surface contacting one face of the sheet to the other surface contacting 
the other face of the sheet, characterized by drive means to move the 
first movable surface and a drive coupling between the 
first movable surface and the second movable surface to 
move the second movable surface when the drive means 
moves the first movable surface in use, and wherein, 
the speed of the second movable surface is not equal to 
the speed of the first movable surface and the flexible 
sheet of material is transferred from the slower moving 
surface to the faster moving surface. Typically, the movable surfaces may be continuous and 
are preferably cylindrical surfaces. Preferably, the 
movable surfaces are the curved surfaces of two drums 
which are typically cylindrical. Preferably the movable surfaces are a receiver surface 
and a feeder surface. Preferably the drive coupling comprises two 
co-operating gears, one gear coupled to each movable 
surface. Typically where the movable surfaces are 
cylindrical surfaces, the radius of the gear attached 
to the slower moving surface is greater than the radius 
of the slower moving surface and the radius of the gear 
attached to the faster moving surface is less than the 
radius of faster moving surface. Typically, the difference in speeds between the movable 
surfaces is less than 10%. Preferably the faster moving surface is the surface of 
a vacuum
