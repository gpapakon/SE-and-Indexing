<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of digital demodulation of digital data according to which the radio broadcast signal is filtered in order to separate the information signal. The demodulation method includes the following steps:   a) sampling of the information signal at a sampling frequency Fo which is a multiple of the predetermined frequency and higher than the frequency of the subcarrier, so as to obtain a sampled signal, b) separation of the sampled signal into two signals in quadrature,   c) filtering of the two signals in quadrature in order to eliminate therefrom at least the signals of frequency higher than (Fo - B), B designating the half-bandwidth of the information signal, d) squaring and summing of the two filtered signals in quadrature in order to restore a data signal.
