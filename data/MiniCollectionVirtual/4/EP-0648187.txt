<ABSTRACT>
A clamping device (2) adapted to be used to grasp an article or to clamp a tool to a workpiece, comprising: (a) a substantially flat or curved vacuum chamber (21) having a lower surface contained or comprised in a vacuum body (14, 15); (b) a compressible seal (18) located at or adjacent the perimeter of the vacuum body, the compressible seal being located in a groove (19) in the vacuum body, the groove being so dimensioned that the compressible seal, when pressed against an article or workpiece, expands and/or moves into a space in the groove thus stabilising the position of the compressible seal and improving its airtight qualities; and (c) a source of vacuum (23) for connection to the vacuum chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clamping device and in particular to a clamping device
for temporarily attaching a tool to a surface of an article.The clamping device to which the invention relates is of the type which comprises
a base plate having a lower surface; a groove formed in the lower surface and
extending around the periphery of the base plate, the groove being defined by a
bottom face, an inwardly facing side face and an outwardly facing side face, the
side faces each extending from the bottom face to the lower surface of the base
plate; a compressible seal having side faces located in the groove and protruding
externally therefrom, the lower surface and compressible seal defining a vacuum
chamber together with the article surface when the base plate is pressed toward
the article surface in use of the clamping device said compressible seal being
dimensioned relative to the groove so that, and when sealing the article surface,
the seal deforms laterally within the groove; and a means to supply a
vacuum to the vacuum chamber.Suction pads and similar devices are known for grasping articles, for example, to
transport an article from one position to another. They are also used for such
purposes as attaching a tool to a workpiece. Suction pads tend to gradually lose
their "vacuum" and become detached from the article to be grasped or the
workpiece. It is possible to overcome this problem by providing continuous
suction to a variant of a suction pad.United States patent 2730370 discloses a clamping device for holding workpieces
which are to be subjected to various machining operations or other treatment.
The device includes a vacuum body providing a vacuum chamber having a lower
surface. A compressible sealing ring is located in a relatively enlarged cross-sectional
groove formed in the lower surface. In use of the device, the sealing
ring seals against a surface of the workpiece. A passageway in the body serves
to exhaust air from the vacuum chamber so as to create a vacuum in the chamber
and thereby hold the body against the workpiece. The sealing ring deforms
laterally within the groove when sealing against the workpiece. Australian patent 274586 Woodfield Bennett Limited discloses
a pick up head comprising a back plate provided with a soft
rubber seal positioned on the underneath of the plate.Australian patent 29280/67 Vacu-Lift Maschinenbau GmbH also
discloses an annular sealing ring, which in this case has a
support. The annular sealing ring surrounds a vacuum
chamber.Australian patent 71603/74

<CLAIMS>
A clamping device for temporarily attaching a tool
to a surface of an article comprising :


(a) a base plate (14) having a lower surface (20) ;
(b) a groove (19) formed in the lower surface (20) and
extending around the periphery (15) of the base plate (14),

the groove (19) being defined by a bottom face, an inwardly
facing side face and an outwardly facing side face, the side

faces each extending from the bottom face to the lower
surface (20) of the base plate (14) ;
(c) a compressible seal (18) having side faces located
in the groove (19) and protruding externally therefrom, the

lower surface (20) and compressible seal (18) defining a
vacuum chamber (26) together with the article surface (21)

when the base plate (14) is pressed toward the article
surface (21) in use of the clamping device ; said

compressible seal (18) being dimensioned relative to the
groove (19) so that, and when sealing the article

surface (21), the seal (18) deforms laterally within the
groove ;
(d) a means (13) to supply a vacuum to the vacuum
chamber (26) ; and
(e) characterised in that the lateral deformation of
the seal within the groove is such that the seal engages against

both the side faces, and also deforms laterally externally
of the groove (19) to engage against the lower surface (20)

immediately adjacent the groove (19), deformation of the
seal (18) improving its airtight qualities and restricting

the seal (18) against inward and outward lateral movement
relative to the base plate (14) thereby stabilising the base

plate (14) on the article.
A clamping device as claimed in claim 1,
characterised in that the base plate (14) is provided with

a degree of flexibility such that its lower surface (20) may
be adjusted to adhere to an irregular surface (21). 
A clamping device as claimed in claim 1 or
claim 2, characterised in that at least one protrusion (25)

is provided on the lower surface (20) of the base
plate (14), the protrusion (25) projecting a distance from

the lower surface (20), which distance is less than a
distance the compressible seal (18) protrudes from the

groove (19) when undeformed, the protrusion (25) engaging
the article surface (21) upon deformation of the

compressible seal (18) to thereby limit the extent of seal
deformation and further stabilise the base plate (14) on the

article.
A clamping device as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the seal (18) may move

to a substantial degree from outside to the inside of the
groove (19) to assist in conforming the seal (18) to

roughnesses on the surface (21) of the article or workpiece
to be grasped or worked upon.
A clamping device as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the seal (18) is

adhered to the bottom of the groove (19).
A clamping device as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a vacuum generating

device is provided in combination with the remainder of the
clamping device (2).
A clamping device as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that a separate source of

vacuum is provided.
A clamping device as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that a tool (12) is attached

to the base plate (14), the tool (12) being so located that
it may be operated to perform work operations on an article

or workpiece.
A clamping device as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the groove (19) tapers

away from the lower surface of the base plate (14) to grip
the compressible seal (18)
