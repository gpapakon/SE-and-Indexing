<ABSTRACT>
A method of and apparatus for stable regulation of transmission power level in a radio system use the carrier-to-interference (C/I) ratio of the communication channel. A C/I target that is a monotonically decreasing function of the interference on the channel is used for regulating the transmission power level. Thus, as the interference increases the transmission power increases to compensate, but to a level yielding a lower C/I level. The path loss or gain of the channel may also be determined and used in the regulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of transmission power
regulation techniques in radio communications, and more
particularly to a method of and system for regulating power,
preferably based on the carrier to interference (C/I) ratio.To minimize interference between communicators using a radio
communication system, the power levels of the radio signals
may be regulated. For example, interference between different
call connections using the same radio channel in a mobile
radiotelephone system might be reduced by regulating the
transmission power levels of the mobile stations and base
stations. The goal would be to ensure that only the transmission
power necessary to maintain satisfactory call quality is
used so that the likelihood of interference between calls
using the same radio channel would be reduced.In existing cellular systems, each cell is designed so that a
minimal C/I ratio may be obtained in, for example, approximately
90% of the cell under normal traffic conditions.
Without transmission power regulation, most of the calls in
each cell's interior have a much better C/I than necessary and
may cause calls at the peripheries of other cells to use
higher transmission power levels in order for those calls to
be heard clearly. In other words, the calls in the cell
interiors create more interference than necessary without
transmission power regulation.Another advantage of power regulation for cellular telephone
systems is that system capacity can be increased by approximately
70% as compared to an unregulated system, assuming the
C/I ratio is the same for all calls. Another reason to 
maintain the power at the lowest possible level is to reduce
the energy consumed by the mobile station. Accordingly, the
batteries used to power portable mobile stations can have a
smaller capacity with the result that the portable mobile
stations can be made smaller.In prior radiotelephone systems, for example as shown in U.S.
Patent No. 4,485,486 to Webb et al., power regulation involves
the base station measuring the signal strength of transmissions
received from the mobile station, comparing the received
signal strength with upper and lower thresholds that indicate
a desired range for proper reception, and issuing a power
adjustment order to the mobile station based on the comparison.
The process is repeated at relatively infrequent
intervals, typically on the order of once every five seconds,
and the mobile's transmission power is controlled only
coarsely. This type of control assumes that the disturbance
