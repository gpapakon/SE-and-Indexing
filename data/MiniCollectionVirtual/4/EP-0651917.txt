<ABSTRACT>
The flat strip connection element may be provided with commercially available connections or couplings. Thanks to the optional pressure-sensitive coating (5), the flat connection may be quickly mounted. It is mainly suitable for leading through window and door rebates or underneath floor and wall coverings. It is also suitable for computer networks. The basic design of this flat strip connection element allows it to be used instead of coaxial cables or other cable types. The type of its plastic outer sheath (1) allows its colour to be adapted to the site of use. The copper sheath (2), which stabilizes the flat connection element, at the same time forms a shielding from connection to connection. The inner insulation (3) is determined during manufacture according to the destined use of the flat connection element. The single- or multiple-core leads (4) are sized according to the destined use.
