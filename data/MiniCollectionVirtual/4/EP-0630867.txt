<ABSTRACT>
Lead-free, tin phosphate glasses contain 25-50 mole 
percent P₂O₅, 30-70% SnO, 0-15% ZnO, the mole ratio of 

SnO:ZnO being greater than 5:1, and an effective amount up 
to 25% total of at least one oxide in the indicated 

proportion selected from the group consisting of up to 25% 
R₂O, wherein R₂O consists of 0-25% Li₂O, 0-25% Na₂O, and 

0-25% K₂O, up to 20% B₂O₃, up to 5% Al₂O₃, up to 5% SiO₂, and 
up to 5% WO₃. The glasses are particularly useful as 

sealing glass frits in sealing material to join component 
parts in electrical and electronic devices. The sealing 

glass material may contain mill additions to reduce the 
effective coefficient of thermal expansion in a seal, as 

well as a strength reinforcing additive having a coefficient 
of thermal expansion preferably below 120 x 10⁻⁷/°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to tin phosphate glasses used as 
sealing frits in vitreous fusion seals. Numerous special sealing glasses have been developed 
for use in joining glass parts with each other, or with 
metals, alloys, or ceramics. In making a fusion-type seal, the material must be 
heated to a temperature where it becomes soft enough to wet 
the sealing surface and form an adherent, hermetic bond, 
while maintaining the sealing temperature as low as 
possible, particularly for sealing electrical and 
electronic articles. Low temperature sealing lead glasses, having softening 
points in the 430°-500°C range and coefficients of thermal 
expansion in the 70-90 x 10-7/°C range, are described, e.g. 
in U.S. Patent No. 2,642,633. Lead-zinc borate glasses 
thermally devitrifying or crystallizing have been 
investigated for cathode ray tube (CRT) sealing materials. For this and other purposes, the glasses are used as 
powders or frits, commonly mixed with an organic vehicle, 
such as amyl acetate, to form a flowable or extrudable 
paste, this mixture being applied to the sealing surface, 
optionally with mill additions to modify and/or control 
thermal expansion of the seal. For electrical and electronic sealing purposes, even 
lower sealing temperatures are needed.  
 To achieve low residual strain in a seal, its 
coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) should closely match 
the CTEs of the parts being sealed. Electronic and electrical sealing applications tend to 
involve a large number of different materials. Further, 
these materials tend to have CTEs that vary over a wide 
range. The required CTEs are generally lower than the 
values of 95-105 X 10-7/°C encountered in sealing CRT 
components, e.g. to match alumina; 30-40 to match silicon 
and borosilicate glasses; and 0-10 to match certain glass-ceramics 
and fused silicas (always X 10-7/°C). In addition to flow and expansion compatibility, a 
sealing glass frit desirably has good wettability of the 
glass parts being sealed, solubility in a common industrial 
solvent for salvage purposes, and compatibility with 
organic vehicles, especially amyl acetate. There has been a continuing desire for a sealing glass 
frit having all the favorable characteristics of lead-zinc 
borate glasses, but with even lower sealing temperature 
and, for health and safety, without lead. The present invention proposes to provide a lead-free 
sealing glass frit; particularly suited to form fusion 
seals between electronic and electrical components having 
CTEs useful for
