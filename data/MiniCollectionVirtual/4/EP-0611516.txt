A method of reducing data in the transmission and/or storage of digital signals 
from N channels dependent on one another, in which sampled values from signals in 

the time domain are transformed in blocks into the frequency domain, i.e. into spectral 
values, the spectral values are coded, transmitted and/or stored, decoded and 

transformed back into N channels in the time domain, characterized in that a value is 
determined from the spectral values of corresponding blocks of the different channels, 

being a measure of the spectral distance between the signals of the different channels, 
and is compared with a predetermined threshold value, and in that, on falling below 

the threshold, a common coding of the signals from different channels is effected. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the spectral distance 
between the signals of different channels is determined from corresponding frequency 

range segments of the signals. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that signals from two

left stereo channels and is formed according to the following equation,
