<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a source of 
secondary power supply and may be applied as a power source 

for luminescent lamps. 
The power supply consists of an electronic starter with a 
current-proportional controlled mains voltage rectifier, assembled 

in the half-bridge circuit. The introduced components 
and their connection in the power supply exclude the "cold" 

switching-on of the lamp, limit both the peak value of the no-load 
voltage and the starting current. In special versions of 

the power supply, provision has been made of high noise stability, 
exclusion of unregulated switch-on of the lamp, quick 

availability for operation of the electronic starter and preliminary 
warm-up of the lamp cathodes. The power supply provides 

the matching of the parameters of the lamp and the power 
supply in the start-up procedures, which increases the operation 

reliability of both the power supply and the luminescent 
lamps, prolonging thus their service life to a considerable 

extent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention can be classified as a source of secondary 
power supply and may be applied as a power source for 
luminescent lamps. It ensures necessary modes of switch-on, 
inflammation and operation of a luminescent lamp. The existent power supply for luminescent lamps includes 
a starter and a ballast element, which is in series connection 
with the first outputs of the first and the second luminescent 
lamp cathode; between the second outputs of the first and 
the second luminescent lamp cathode, a starter /1/ has been 
connected. Disadvantages of such devices are - a comparatively 
low efficiency, heavy weight, the dimensions of electromagnetic 
elements (due to low frequency of the mains voltage - 50 
Hz), and heavy acoustic noises. The use of inductive ballast 
causes phase difference between the consumption current and 
the voltage, which considerably overloads the power network. 
Besides, a rather low reliability of the starter limits the 
reliability of such devices on the whole. More closer to the suggested device is a power supply for 
luminescent lamps, containing an electronic starter, a mains 
voltage rectifier with its input connected to the input 
terminals and the output connected to the circuit of the 
current-proportional controlled voltage converter, assembled  
 
in the half-bridge circuit with n-s connected in parallel to 
one of its arms (n=1, 2, 3, ... chains, consisting of series 
connected ballast element and the first outputs of the first 
and the second luminescent lamp cathode respectively). A 
capacitor is connected between the second outputs of the first 
and the second luminescent lamp cathode, besides, the 
electronic starter includes a rectifier; a threshold element, 
its output connected to the output of the rectifier; and a 
voltage divider, the tap of which is connected to the input of 
the threshold element /2/. The disadvantage of this device is 
unreliable mode of expected switch-on. It is connected with 
the fact that at the moment of switch-on of the power supply 
by the threshold element, the electronic starter switches on 
too, which changes the operation mode of the voltage converter 
to a higher conversion frequency. At the same time the 
luminescent lamp is affected by the open-circuit voltage Uxx 
and a Ik current goes through its cathodes. After a certain 
period of time, the lamp ignition voltage drops (at the expence 
of cathode warm-up) and it lights up. After that the voltage 
converter goes to a lower conversion frequency. Due to 
the effect of the
