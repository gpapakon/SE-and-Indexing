<ABSTRACT>
Recovery of high purity cyclopropylmethyl ketone (I) from a reaction product or other mixture containing (I), 4,5-dihydro-2-methylfuran (II), addition products of (II) and optionally other impurities formed in the synthesis of (I) from 2-acetyl-butyrolactone comprises at least one continuously operating rectification stage, in which the mixture is supplied to the rectifier from the side above a sump.

A process for preparing high-purity cyclopropyl
methyl ketone from reaction discharges or other

mixtures which comprise cyclopropyl methyl ketone,
4,5-dihydro-2-methylfuran, and addition products of

4,5-dihydro-2-methylfuran, with or without other
impurities which can result from the synthesis of

cyclopropyl methyl ketone from 2-acetylbutyrolactone,
characterized by at least one continuous

rectification step having a side feed of the
mixture to be fractionated by rectification into a

rectification apparatus above the bottom.
A process according to claim 1, characterized by
bottom temperatures in all distillation treatment

steps of less than or equal to 160°C.
A process according to claim 2, characterized by
bottom temperatures of less than or equal to 140°C.
A process according to claim 3, characterized by
bottom temperatures of less than or equal to 120°C.
A process according to at least one of the
preceding claims, characterized by components more

volatile than cyclopropyl methyl ketone being
separated off by distillation prior to the

rectification step. 
A process according to at least one of the
preceding claims 1 to 4, characterized by a single

rectification step, in which the feed of the
mixture to be fractionated into the rectification

apparatus is arranged in such a manner that the
ratio of the number of theoretical plates of the

enrichment column to the number of theoretical
plates of the stripping column assumes a value of 1

to 2 and in which the cyclopropyl methyl ketone is
obtained by sidestream takeoff in the lower third,

based on the number of theoretical plates, of the
stripping column above the bottom.
A process according to at least one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the

cyclopropyl methyl ketone is produced by
distillation at a pressure of 300 to 1050 mbar.
A process according to at least one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the

cyclopropyl methyl ketone is produced by
distillation at a pressure of 500 to 1030 mbar.
A process according to at least one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the

cyclopropyl methyl ketone is produced by
distillation at a pressure of 800 to 1020 mbar.
