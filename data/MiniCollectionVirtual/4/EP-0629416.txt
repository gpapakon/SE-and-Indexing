<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a catheter comprising a tube-like 
basic body with a woven round metal wire reinforcement. The 

catheter also comprises on the distal end (4) at least one electrically 
operating element such as a sensor (5) and on the 

proximal end an electrical connecting member (6). Of each 
electrically operating element and connecting member at 

least one is electrically connected to at least one of the 
metal wires of the woven metal wire reinforcement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a catheter comprising a tube-like 
basic body with a woven round metal wire reinforcement. 
Such catheters are known, for instance as angiographic 
catheters. The metal wire reinforcement serves to give the 
catheter a great torsional rigidity and pressure resistance 
at a small diameter. Because the catheter can resist a high 
pressure, a sufficient quantity of liquid, such as contrast 
fluid, can be transported in the catheter to the desired 
position in the bloodstream of a patient even when the 
diameter of the lumen is small. The invention now has for its object to provide a new 
application for a catheter of the described type. This object is achieved with a catheter as characterized 
in claim 1. The metal wire reinforcement or at least 
one or more wires thereof are used as electrical conductor 
so that no separate electrical conductors have to be incorporated 
in the catheter and the catheter can thus retain 
a small diameter. Preferably phosphor bronze wires are used 
for the metal wires of the metal wire reinforcement. 
Compared to the usual stainless steel this material has the 
advantage of a good electrical conductivity so that little 
loss occurs. Phosphor bronze has high strength so that the 
choice of this material does not have an unfavourable effect 
on the further properties of the catheter.A first suitable 
embodiment of the catheter according to the invention is 
characterized in claim 2. The woven metal wire reinforcement 
can function in this embodiment as earth lead or shielding 
protector. Through the lumen can then be arranged for 
instance a high-frequency conductor which conducts energy to 
the distal end of the catheter without the intermediate 
region being affected in undesired manner.  A further development is characterized in claim 3. Each 
of the separately insulated metal wires can thus form a conductor 
for instance for a sensor on the distal end of the 
catheter. Since it is usual to employ a comparatively large 
number of wires in a metal wire reinforcement, a typical 
number being for instance 16, a large number of different 
signal currents or other electrical currents can be conducted 
between the distal and the proximal end of the conductor 
without the catheter having to be given a larger diameter to 
receive the conductors. A favourable further development is herein characterized 
in claim 4. It is hereby possible in simple manner to 
form the correct connections at the one end of the catheter 
as well at the other end. A suitable
