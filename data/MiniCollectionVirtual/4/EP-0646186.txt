<ABSTRACT>
There is now provided a sintered titanium based carbonitride alloy for metal cutting containing hard constituents based on Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and/or W and 3-30 % binder phase based on Co and/or Ni. The structure contains, well dispersed and/or as agglomerates, hard constituent grains essentially without core-rim structure with a mean grain size of 0.8-5 (my)m in a more fine-grained matrix with a mean grain size of the hard constituents of 
<
 1 (my)m. The matrix is made from a powder being prepared from an intermetallic prealloy disintegrated to 
<
 50 (my)m particle size and then carbonitrided in situ to extremely fine-grained hard constituents having a diameter 
<
= 0.1 (my)m within the binder phase metals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sintered carbonitride
alloy having titanium as main component and
intended preferably for metal cutting applications.Titanium based carbonitride alloys, usually named
cermets, are well established as cutting tool material
often used for finishing at high cutting speed. More
recently, the area of application has been widened
towards more toughness demanding applications which has
been made possible by, e.g., increased binder phase and
nitride contents in these alloys compared to tungsten
based, more brittle hard materials. Another way of obtaining
increased toughness is disclosed in Swedish
Patent Application No. 9004121-1 (EP-A-494 059) in which extremely
fine-grained alloys are made using melt metallurgically
made intermetallic prealloys.EP-A-214 944 also relates to uniquely fine grained PM hard material
alloys made from a cast prealloy of hard material forming and binder
forming elements wherein the prealloy was crushed and then nitrided and
carburized.During sintering of titanium based carbonitride
alloys a solution-precipitation process takes place. As
a result, a very common structure in such alloys is hard
constituent grains with a core-rim structure. An early
patent in this area is U.S. Patent 3,971,656 which
discloses Ti- and N-rich cores and rims rich in Mo, W
and C. By a suitable combination of core-rim-structures
in well balanced proportions optimal properties regarding
wear resistance, toughness behaviour and/or
plastic deformation can be obtained as disclosed in
Swedish Patent Application No. 8902306-3.Swedish Patent Application No. 9101385-4 discloses a
titanium based carbonitride alloy with coarse grains
with core-rim structure in a more finegrained matrix.EP-A-447388 and EP-A-464396 disclose manufacturing
of carbonitrides directly by carbonitriding of the
oxides of the metals or the metals themselves. According to the present invention it has now been
found that it is possible to further improve the
properties of a material according to SE 9004121-1 (EP-A-494 059)
regarding toughness behaviour and/or wear resistance. By
adding additional more coarsegrained hard constituents
to original prealloyed powder a material with improved
wear resistance and/or a significant improvement in
toughness behaviour relative to the original material is
obtained.The invention is defined in claims 1 and 5. Optional features
are set out in the dependent claims.Figure 1 shows in about 5000X magnification the
microstructure of an alloy according to the invention.Figure 2
