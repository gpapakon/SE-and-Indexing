<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyorganosiloxane-type
thermoplastic resin excellent in not only slidability,
abrasion resistance, weatherability, and impact resistance but
also fatigue resistance and chemical resistance.The technique of modifying thermoplastic resins with
rubbers to improve the impact strength of the resins has been
established. Examples of such modified resins include ABS
resins obtained by reinforcing styrene-acrylonitrile resins
(AS resins) with a butadiene rubber and AAS resins obtained
by reinforcing AS resins with an acrylic rubber.A silicone rubber may be usable as such a base rubber
ingredient. However, a mere blend of a polyorganosiloxane
with a thermoplastic resin has insufficient impact resistance
because of poor compatibility between these ingredients.
Although the technique of grafting a vinyl monomer onto a
rubber as in the production of ABS resins is needed to obtain
good compatibility, polyorganosiloxanes generally have low
reactivity with vinyl monomers and hence formation of a graft
copolymer is difficult. Several techniques have been
disclosed for forming this kind of graft copolymer.For example, a technique of polymerizing a vinyl
monomer in the presence of a polyorganosiloxane containing a 
vinyl or allyl group to form a graft copolymer having improved
impact strength is proposed in JP-A-50-109282. (The term "JP-A"
as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese
patent application.")In JP-A-52-130885 is proposed a technique of improving
the impact strength of a vinyl polymer using a polyorganosiloxane
containing a mercapto group in place of a polyorganosiloxane
containing a vinyl or allyl group.In JP-A-60-252613, JP-A-61-106614, and JP-A-61-136510
is proposed a technique of polymerizing a vinyl monomer in an
emulsion of a polyorganosiloxane containing an acrylic or
methacrylic group to thereby obtain a graft copolymer having
a high graft efficiency and excellent impact strength.Further, a technique of graft-polymerizing a vinyl
monomer onto a polyorganosiloxane containing a vinylphenyl
group to obtain a graft copolymer excellent in impact strength
and slidability is proposed in JP-A-2-8209.With respect to crosslinking agents, a technique of
improving the impact resistance of a graft copolymer by using
a polyfunctional silane crosslinking agent, e.g., methyltrimethoxysilane
or tetraethoxysilane, as an additional crosslinking
agent is proposed in JP-A-60-252613 and JP-A-2-8209.However, in the case of using a polyorganosiloxane
containing any of the
