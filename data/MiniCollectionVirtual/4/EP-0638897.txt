<ABSTRACT>
A tracking error detecting circuit is used in a magnetic 

reproducing apparatus for reproducing an information 
signal from tracks (2a,2b,2c) which are formed on a magnetic tape (8) 

obliquely in a longitudinal direction of the magnetic tape. 
The tracks have selectively recorded 

thereon a pilot signal (F

,F

) 
multiplexed with the information signal. The tracking error 

detecting circuit comprises: a rotating magnetic head (1) scanning 
the tracks for reproducing the information signal on 

which the pilot signal is selectively multiplexed to obtain 
a reproduced signal; a comparator (12) for comparing a level of 

the reproduced signal with a specified level and for issuing 
a binary signal representing a comparison result; and a 

level detecting circuit (3a,4a,3b,4b) 
for detecting a level of the pilot 

signal contained in the reproduced signal from an output of 
the comparator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tracking error detecting circuit
of a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus using pilot signals.As one tracking control methods of a helical scan type magnetic
recording and reproducing apparatus, it is known to record pilot signals and
information signals in multiplex. The information signals are reproduced while
controlling either a running of a magnetic tape or driving a head in a track
widthwise direction in accordance with the reproduced pilot signal. The relative
configuration of the head and a track may therefore be kept normal.A conventional tracking control method used in an 8 mm format
VCR (video cassette recorder) or the like is described below. In the track
recorded on the magnetic tape of such a VCR, aside from information signals
such as video signals, four kinds of pilot signals for tracking f1 to f4 are
recorded in multiplex by repeating sequentially in every track. Supposing a
horizontal synchronous signal frequency to be fh, a frequency difference
between tracks of the pilot signals is selected to be fh and 3fh. More
specifically, f1 = 6.5 fh, f2 = 7.5 fh, f3 = 10.5 fh, and f4 = 9.5 fh. While the head
is scanning on a main track in which a pilot signal f2 is recorded, the
reproduced signal from the head, which is wider than a track width, is mixed
with crosstalk pilot signals f1 = 6.5 fh, f3 = 10.5 fh from both adjacent tracks.
Therefore, when the reproduced signal is multiplied by a reference signal 7.5
fh at the same frequency as the pilot signal f2 of the main track in a multiplying
circuit, pilot components from both the adjacent tracks are transformed into beat
components at frequencies of fh and 3fh, respectively. By detecting and
comparing individual amplitude levels therefore, it can be found which one of
the right or left adjacent tracks is mixed more, that is, that the head is deviated
to the right or left. Actually, the reproduced signal is multiplied by reference
signals, which have frequencies equivalent to f1 to f4, from a reference signal 
generating circuit sequentially in the multiplying circuit. From outputs of the
multiplying circuit, the fh component is detected by a first band pass filter
having its centre at fh and a first amplitude detecting circuit for detecting its
output level, and the 3fh component is detected by a second band pass filter
having its centre at 3fh and a second amplitude detecting circuit. A level
difference between the fh component and the 3fh component is then detected
by a differential circuit.
