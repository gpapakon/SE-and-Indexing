<ABSTRACT>
A parting compound for 
green sand molding, which contains 

hydrocarbon oil as the principal 
agent and other essential components 

including a surfactant as a 
dispersant and an anionic surfactant 

and/or strongly basic amine as 
a wettability improver. This compound 

is used in the form of oil-in-water 
emulsion by diluting with water. 

Because of the dilutability with 
water, this compound can be readily 

stored and transported in a non-bulky 
state. Furthermore, the proportion 

of water can be increased as 
compared with that of the hydrocarbon 

oil in the step of applying the 
compound, thus contributing to resource 

saving and improvement in 
the resistance to fire hazard.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stock solution of a release 
agent for green sand mold forming containing a hydrocarbon 
oil as the main component for lubrication and to a release 
agent for green sand mold forming. A green sand mold which is the most based type of mold 
stays in the main stream of molds because its advantages are 
a good forming productivity, inexpensive materials for mold, 
and applicability for repeated use compared with other molds 
such as thermosetting mold, self-hardening mold, and gas-hardening 
mold. The applicant of this invention provided a release 
agent for green sand mold forming which is an water-in-oil 
(W/O) emulsion, or a system of oil phase of hydrocarbon 
containing dispersed water phase, (refer to the Examined 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 63-29625). This type of release agent has, however, the following 
disadvantages. 
(1) Since the emulsion system used is the water-in-oil (W/O) 
type, the system can not diluted with water. Accordingly, 
the system needs to be prepared from the production stage to 
have a composition of application. This requirement causes 
problems with regard to shipment and storage. (2) The water content is limited to approximately 60% at 
the highest from the standpoint of stability of the prepared  
 
liquid and releasability of the product. This percentage of 
water content is not sufficiently high in terms of resource 
saving and safety against fire. To cope with these concerns, the release agent may be 
prepared in the oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. However, a 
uniform lubricant film is considered difficult to form on 
the surface of a mold after being used for forming. The 
reason of the difficulty is that, since the main component 
for lubrication is a hydrocarbon oil, the surface of a mold 
once used for forming by applying a releasing agent, 
particularly a metallic mold, leaves the oil component on 
the surface thereof, which remained oil repels a release 
agent of water-based O/W emulsion when it is applied onto 
the surface of the metallic mold. An object of this invention is to provide a stock 
solution of release agent for green sand mold forming, which 
stock solution is applicable in a form of O/W emulsion and 
is diluted at the point of application. Another object of this invention is to provide a stock 
solution of a release agent for green sand mold forming, 
which stock solution is applicable in a form of an aqueous 
solution and does not require the use of hydrocarbon oil. (1) A preferable mode of the stock solution of a
