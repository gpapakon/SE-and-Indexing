<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to composite 
membranes and membranes which are formed from modified 
poly(phenylene oxide) polymers having improved film 
forming properties and separation characteristics. The 
present invention further relates to poly(phenylene 
oxide) polymer and modified poly(phenylene oxide) 
polymer, having improved membrane forming 
characteristics, and processes for producing the same. Various permeable or semipermeable membranes 
are known to be used in a variety of fluid separations. 
These membranes can offer, inter alia, significant cost 
savings over other fluid separation means, such as 
adsorption and distillation means. The effectiveness 
of the membranes in fluid separation, however, is 
highly dependent on the permeability and selectivity of 
the membranes. As the increased permeability 
requirement in the recent years has resulted in the 
movement of membrane art in the direction of reducing 
the thickness of membranes, the strength and film 
forming characteristics of membrane materials have also 
become increasingly important. The strength and film 
forming characteristics play an important role in 
producing very thin membranes. At the present time, fluid separation 
membranes are known to be made from a wide variety of 
polymeric materials. Of these polymeric materials, 
poly(phenylene oxide) polymer or chemically modified 
poly(phenylene oxide) polymer, such as sulfonated  
 
poly(phenylene oxide), is most attractive as a membrane 
forming material because of the good combination of 
permeation and separation characteristics of these 
materials and because of the ready availability of 
poly(phenylene oxide) polymer. Indeed, such 
desirability of poly(phenylene oxide) based polymer 
materials has led to the development of a variety of 
poly(phenylene oxide) polymer based membranes. Chemical Abstract No. 236575Y, volume 112, 
"Hollow Poly(phenylene oxide) Fibers and Process for 
Manufacturing Them" by M. Pechocova et al, Czech. CS 
263,672, shows an asymmetric membrane, i.e., hollow 
fibers, useful for reverse osmosis, micro- and ultra-filtration, 
dialysis and other separation processes. 
The asymmetric membrane is prepared by spinning a 
solution containing poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene 
oxide) polymer or sulfonated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene 
oxide) polymer having a molecular weight 
equal to or greater than 74,000 through a spinneret 
with ring-shaped holes. J. Smid et al. in the Journal of Membrane 
Science, Vol. 64, p. 121-129, 1991, "The Formation of
