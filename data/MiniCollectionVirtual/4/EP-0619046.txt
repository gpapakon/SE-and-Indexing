<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an interior assembly (10) for an electrical distribution device having at least one bus bar (26, 28, 30) integrally formed with branch stabs for electrically connecting to terminals extending from a plurality of circuit interrupters. The assembly includes a generally planar support base (12) having a front face and back face for mounting bus bars (26, 28, 30). A cover (14) for the front face and a back shield (16) for the back face of the support base (12) have sufficient size to substantially cover the bus bars (26, 28, 30). The cover and back shield (16) include elements (54, 84, 70, 72) for securing the body to the device so that the position of the cover (14) prevents contact between the bus bar (26, 28, 30) and a person's finger or equipment particularly when an individual circuit interrupter is mounted to the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an interior 
assembly of a panelboard, switchboard, electrical 
distribution device, and the like, and more particularly, 
to a combination of components like a cover which 
protects bus bars from accidental contact and is manually 
assembled and disassembled. Panelboards, switchboards, and other electrical 
distribution devices are commonly used in residential, 
commercial, and industrial buildings. Individual circuit 
interrupters are mounted to these devices to protect 
branch circuits against overload and fault conditions. 
Basically, circuit interrupters like circuit breakers and 
fusible switches comprise a pair of separable contacts, a 
spring-operated mechanism for effecting separation of the 
contacts, and a tripping mechanism or fuse which 
automatically releases the operating mechanism upon the 
occurrence of an overload or fault condition. Panelboards and the like are often constructed 
with bus bars or projecting lugs to form disconnect 
contacts for the removable individual circuit 
interrupters. These bus bars and lugs are rigidly 
attached to the upper surface of the panelboard support 
molding. Since the bus bars are exposed to the front of 
the panelboard, it is possible that an operator could be  
 
severely burned or shocked if they accidentally 
touched the terminals while installing the circuit 
breaker. Furthermore, the main circuit interrupter 
could be short circuited if conducting material 
accidentally bridged across the respective bus bars. 
The bus bars may also be subject to damage during 
the installation of other components near the 
panelboard. Typically, the installation of a panelboard 
interior to a load center base requires special 
tools and a variety of different fasteners. The 
number of tools, parts and operations involved in 
the panelboard installation poses a high safety 
risk. Furthermore, many panelboard components are 
pre-set at the factory and are not readily adapted 
to various single and multi-phase installations. In view of the increasing safety requirements 
for load centers and panelboards there is a need for 
an interior assembly which protects against 
accidental exposure to bus bars and is usable with 
components like circuit breakers already in the 
market. There is another need for an interior 
assembly which can be manually assembled in the 
field in a variety of combinations to fit various 
installations. US-A-5,072,071 discloses an electrical 
distribution load center which consists of a nonconductive 
enclosur

(26, 28) while allowing access to the bus bar (26, 
28) with the terminals of a circuit interrupter, the 

cover (14) having a cross-sectional thickness 
sufficiently thin to position the cover (14) between 

the bus bar (26, 28) and each circuit interrupter,

face (80), the bottom face (80) of the cover (14) 
abutting the top surface of the bus bar (26, 28) so 

that the bus bar (26, 28) nests and secures between 
the channel (22, 24) and the cover (14) without 

fasteners;  
 
means (90) for demountably securing the cover 
(14) to the support base (12) so that the position 

of the cover (14) prevents contact between the bus 
bar (26, 28) and a person's finger or equipment when 

the individual circuit interrupter is mounted to the 
assembly (10), CHARACTERISED IN THAT : 
the securing means (90) are manually operated;
