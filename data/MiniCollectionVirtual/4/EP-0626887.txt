<ABSTRACT>
A consumer product passage incorporating a mixing chamber (96) for mixing air and liquid. Consumer packages of the present invention are capable of providing excellent spray qualities at typical consumer product flow rates (e.g., less than about 1.0 cubic centimeters per second) while simultaneously maintaining relatively low air to liquid ratios (e.g., less than about 0.06:1 on a mass basis) and relatively low pressures (e.g., less than about 50 psi). The package of the present invention also offers significant environmental and safety advantages. For example, it does not depend upon dissolved propellants; and it permits the use of water in place of volatile solvents as thinning agents since high surface tension fluids are actually sprayed better. Several packages of the present invention are illustrated, including a standard aerosol version, pump and spray versions, and a finger pump version.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to consumer product packages
which incorporate spray devices; and more particularly, to such
consumer product packages with spray devices which utilize air to aid
small particle spray formation.It has long been desirable to provide consumer product
packages with spray devices which produce excellent spray qualities.
Characteristics of spray quality include mean droplet size (e.g., as
measured by the Sauter mean diameter); droplet size distribution
width; spray velocity and clean starting and stopping (i.e., no
spitting or dripping). Historically, aerosol spray packages have
utilized partially dissolved propellants to pressurize the package.
Atomization is primarily driven by the propellant dissolved in the
product "boiling off" upon exiting the spray device. Unfortunately,
traditional dissolved propellants have been the subject of
environmental concerns for many years now.Spray devices have also utilized vapor tap valves which mix
propellant vapor with the liquid. This improves atomization quality.
It is believed that the vapor provides bubbles which function as
nucleation sites for the dissolved propellant. Exemplary vapor tap
valves are disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,746,796 issued to St. Germain
on August 5, 1953; U.S. Patent 3,544,258 issued on August 19, 1963 to
Presant et. al.; U.S. Patent 4,227,631 issued on October 14, 1980 to
Schneider; and U.S. Patent 4,417,674 issued to Giuffredi on November
29, 1983. One disadvantage of vapor taps is they utilize, and
therefore, release even more of the propellants of environmental
concern. Spray devices have also included passages which pass the
liquid through a swirl chamber immediately prior to its exiting the
discharge orifice. The swirl chamber causes the liquid to exit the
discharge orifice in a thin walled expanding cone configuration which
aids atomization. Swirl chambers are often found on standard aerosol
packages and are usually found on mechanical pumps. Disadvantages
of swirl chambers include manufacturing complexities; the requirement
of relatively high pressures due to the energy losses caused by the
small channels of the swirl chamber; and difficulties atomizing
relatively viscous fluids.Several spray device designs combine more than one
atomization mechanism. For example, many spray devices combine the
vapor tap approach and the swirl chamber approach. Exemplary
combination designs include U.S. Patent 4,247,025 which issued to
Gailitis on January 27, 1981; U.S. Patent 4,260,110 which issued on
April 7, 1981 to

vii) the final exit orifice (95) is dimensioned to provide liquid flow rates less than

1.0 cubic centimeter per second; and
viii) the bubble injection means forms bubbles such that substantially all of the
bubbles have diameters which are greater than the diameter of the exit orifice.

housing and the bubble injection means (90) each providing a portion of the air

passage.

in terms of a mean flow path is less than the distance at which
bubbles coalesce significantly.
A package for spraying consumer products according to
Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the annular gap portion of the

liquid flow passage is small enough that capillary action occurs
such that the halting point of the capillary action is located at

about the location of the air injection means.
