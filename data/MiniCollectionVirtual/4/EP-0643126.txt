<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to lubricating oil 
additive concentrates having a total base number (TBN) greater than 
300 containing an alkaline earth metal hydrocarbyl phenate, a 
process for their production and finished lubricating oil 
compositions containing the additive concentrate. In the internal combustion engine, by-products from the 
combustion chamber often blow by the piston and admix with the 
lubricating oil. Many of these by-products form acidic materials 
within the lubricating oil. This is particularly marked in diesel 
engines operating on low-grade fuels of high sulphur content wherein 
corrosive acids are produced by combustion. The acids thereby 
incorporated in the lubricating oil can include sulphur acids 
produced by oxidation of sulphur, hydrohalic acids derived from 
halogen lead scavengers in the fuel and nitrogen acids produced by 
the oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen within the combustion chamber. 
Such acids cause deposition of sludge and corrosion of the bearings 
and engine parts leading to rapid wear and early breakdown of the 
engine. Compounds generally employed to neutralise the acidic 
materials and disperse sludge within the lubricating oil include 
metal alkyl phenates, wherein the metal is generally an alkaline 
earth metal such as calcium, magnesium or barium. Both "normal" and 
"overbased" alkaline earth metal alkyl phenates have been employed. 
The term "overbased" is used to describe those sulphurised alkaline 
earth metal alkyl phenates in which the ratio of the number of  
 
equivalents of the alkaline earth metal moiety to the number of 
equivalents of the phenol moiety is greater than one, and is usually 
greater than 1.2 and may be as high as 4.5 or greater. In contrast, 
the equivalent ratio of alkaline earth metal moiety to phenol moiety 
in "normal" alkaline earth metal alkyl phenates is one. Thus, the 
"overbased" material contains greater than 20% in excess of the 
alkaline earth metal present in the corresponding "normal" material. 
For this reason "overbased" sulphurised alkaline earth metal alkyl 
phenates have a greater capability for neutralising acidic matter 
than do the corresponding "normal" alkaline earth metal alkyl 
phenates. Alkaline earth metal sulphurised hydrocarbyl phenate-containing 
compositions having a high TBN (total base number as 
measured in mg KOH/g by the method of ASTM D2896), that is a TBN 
greater than 300, typically greater than 350, and a viscosity 
measured at 100°C of less than 1,000 cSt, preferably
