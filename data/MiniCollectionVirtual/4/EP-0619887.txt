<ABSTRACT>
A method for displaying seismic attributes in an open three-dimensional format is provided. The conventional two-dimensional variable-amplitude traces that represent the magnitude of a selected seismic attribute as a function of time are converted to three-dimensional format (21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37). The three-dimensional traces are hung beneath a model of their corresponding data-gathering stations (28) to provide a forest of seismic traces in a wire-frame environment (16). The open configuration of the seismic traces permits the interpreter to see a perspective view of the structure of the subsurface of the earth from any desired viewing angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of seismic data processing
and more particularly to the displaying of 3-D seismic data in a wire frame
environment so that an interpreter can peer into the internal structure of a volume of seismic data.To perform a seismic survey, a plurality of lines of profile are established over
an area of interest. If a detailed three-dimensional (3-D) survey is to be made, the lines
of profile are closely-spaced, typically a few tens of meters apart. Seismic receivers are
distributed along the respective survey lines at observation stations that are separated by
intervals corresponding to the line spacing. The seismic receiver stations thus form a
symmetrical two-dimensional spatial grid having x-y axes over the area to be surveyed
at or near the surface thereof. At each of a plurality of source locations, an acoustic
source is activated to insonify the subsurface. Wavefields emanating from the respective
sources are reflected from subsurface earth layers. The reflected wavefields are detected
by a receiver array that is designated to be associated with each source position. The
seismic receivers convert the earth motions due to reflected acoustic wavefields into
electrical signals which are preferably digitized and recorded on an archival storage
medium as discrete data samples. The recorded discrete data samples are later processed
by any well-known means.Commonly, the processed data are displayed as a cross-section, that is, as a
vertical slice of the earth in two dimensions whose axes are observation-station number
along the spatial x axis and reflection travel time vertically along the z or time axis. If
the acoustic velocity field is known, the vertical axis may be expressed as depth rather
than as reflection travel time. Because of the rectilinear grid that is characteristic of
3-D lines of profile, the cross sections may be oriented along any desired azimuth across
the survey area. Such a cross section shows the structure of the earth beneath each
station in the vertical x-z plane along the chosen azimuth, looking at the slice of the
earth from one side. Additionally, a horizontal two-dimensional slice of the earth, sometimes called
a time slice, can be made at a selected reflection-time or depth level. The axes of the
time slice are the spatial north and east (N-E) grid coordinates of the observation stations
in the horizontal plane. A time or depth slice is a model of the structural relief of the
earth at the chosen level, looking down from above.It is
