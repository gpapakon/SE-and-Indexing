<ABSTRACT>
An Au layer 3 and a Sn layer 5 are laminated on a 
barrier layer 8 which is formed on an optical circuit 

substrate 1. An Au layer 5 having a predetermined 
thickness is formed on the laminated layers as a top layer. 

A junction portion 2 is constituted of these layers. 
An electrode layer of an optical semiconductor element 9 

is made to contact with the top Au layer 5 and the optical 
semiconductor element 9 is pressed to the optical circuit 

substrate 1. Then, by heating, the optical semiconductor 
element 9 is joined on the optical circuit substrate. 

A weight % of Au and Sn in the junction portion 2 of the 
optical circuit substrate 1 is about 80% : 20% before the 

joining, The electrode layer is formed as a thin Au layer. 
The optical circuit substrate 1 is heated at a temperature 

of 280°C or more such that the Au layer and the Sn layer 
are melted and is cooled such that Au and Sn are solidified.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manufacturing method of an optical
semiconductor device in which an optical semiconductor
element is bonded with and fixed to an optical circuit
substrate.An example of an optical semiconductor device in
which an optical semiconductor element is joined with
an optical circuit substrate, is proposed in the pending
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/126,769, entitled
"Optical coupling equipment for An Optical Semiconductor
and An Optical Fiber" and the corresponding patent US-A-5392372
by the inventors of the present
patent application.In order to join the optical semiconductor element
with the optical circuit substrate, gold-tin (AuSn)
eutectic solder is generally used. More particularly,
the solder is first melted by heating and at this time
the optical semiconductor element is placed on the optical
circuit substrate to be pressed to the optical circuit
substrate so that the optical semiconductor element can
be joined on the optical circuit substrate.However, because the AuSn eutectic solder is easy
to be oxidized, the joining process must be performed
in nitrogen atmosphere or reduction atmosphere in which 
hydrogen gas is slightly mixed with nitrogen gas.
In addition, before the optical semiconductor element
is pressed to the optical circuit substrate, a process
so-called "scrubbing process" needs to be performed in
which the optical semiconductor element is applied with
a pressure and is vibrated for removing an oxide film
formed on the AuSn eutectic solder in advance.As another bonding method, there is known the method
in which Sn has been deposited on the junction area of an
electrode of the optical circuit substrate or the junction
area of the optical semiconductor element, and both the
optical circuit substrate and the optical semiconductor
element are heated and pressed to each other to form the
junction. In this case, because Sn is easy to be oxidized,
the non-oxidization atmosphere and the scrubbing process
for the optical semiconductor element are required.Further, there is another method other than the above
methods in which a layer of AuSn eutectic solder is formed
on a junction portion of the optical circuit substrate,
a thin Au layer is formed on the layer of eutectic solder.
An optical semiconductor element is placed on the Au layer
so that the junction is formed by melting the layer of
eutectic solder. The detail of this method is disclosed
in JP-A--1-138777
(1989).There have been many proposals of the structure in 
which optical coupling to an
