<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR LUBRICATING METAL-METAL CONTACT SYSTEMS IN METALWORKING OPERATIONS WITH CYCLOHEZYL ESTERSField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a method for lubricating metal-metal contact systems. More particularly, the invention is directed to a method for lubricating metallic surfaces with compositions which can replace or augment conventional synthetic ester lubricants and other natural fats in applications such as etalwor ing processes.Background of the Invention As metalworking processes become more complex and sophisticated and operate at higher pressures and speeds, increased demands are placed on lubricants to withstand the severe forces generated by hostile environments of the metalworking processes. Typical metalworking processes involve elastic or plastic deformation or cold working of metals. Examples of such metalworking processes include cold rolling of steel or aluminum sheets or foils, stamping, drawing, ironing, cutting, grinding, broaching, drilling and machining of metallic materials. The metallic materials from which the metalworking apparatus and articles to be fabricated are made include steel, cast iron, and ferrous alloys. 

as well as aluminum alloys and other non-ferrous alloys including such components as titanium, magnesium, copper, tin and brass.Desirable lubricants not only reduce the coefficient of sliding friction between contacting metallic surfaces, but, among other attributes, control the temperature of the metalworking components and article during the metalworking process.Lubricants are generally any liquid or solid which when used alone or with other components of a composition reduce friction between metallic parts and facilitate metal removal. Lubricity is the ability of a lubricant material to effectively reduce friction and wear of two metallic surfaces in processes involving elastic or bulk plastic deformation of one or both of the metallic surfaces. Lubricity,of a lubricant is reflected in the degree of smoothness of surface finish of a product of a metalworking process following deformation, as well as the ability to control the temperature of the metalworking components and article during deformation and strain distribution in the metal product formed during the metalworking process.Presently, conventional synthetic ester lubricants, such as polyol esters, and other natural fats are used as lubricating fluids for metalworking operations. U.S. Patent No. 3,526,596 discloses that polyol esters of fatty acids having twelve to twenty- two carbon
