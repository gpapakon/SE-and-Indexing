<ABSTRACT>
The use of compounds having a phosphor amide bond or an enol phosphate bond is disclosed for the preparation of medicaments to be used in the treatment of tumours. Said compounds are advantageously selected from creatine phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvic acid. Application is found particularly in treating tumours resistant to chemotherapy.
