<ABSTRACT>
A goods collection method is disclosed, in which box-shaped 
goods (1A,1B,1C) 

form goods delivery units (11) and are successively received in necessary 
quantities on 

goods receptacles (34) and accommodated in containers (17) or the like. 
Each goods 

receptacle (34) used has a goods reception surface (35) inclined 
downward from a goods 

reception side toward the other side and includes a stopper wall 
provided on the 

other side for stopping received goods (1A,1B,1C). The goods received 
on the goods receptacle (34) 

are caused to gather on the goods reception surface (35) such as to 
be on the side 

thereof adjacent the stopper wall (36).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for
collecting goods suitable for receiving box-shaped goods and accommodating these
goods in containers or the like in goods distribution centers or the like.The present invention will be more fully understood from the
detailed description given below and from the accompanying drawings which
should not be taken to be a limitation on the invention, but for explanation and
understanding only.The drawings:
Fig. 1 is a schematic plan view showing the layout of a goods
collection apparatus according to the invention;Fig. 2 is a front view showing a goods delivery unit and a goods
reception conveyor;Fig. 3 is a front view showing the goods reception conveyor, a
shutter, a table unit and a container conveyor;Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken along arrow line IV-IV in Fig. 3;Fig. 5 is a fragmentary perspective view showing a collection form
deformation prevention wall provided in the table unit;Figs. 6A and 6B are views illustrating a step of transfer of goods
from the goods delivery unit to a goods receptacle;Figs. 7A and 7B are views illustrating a step of transfer of first layer
goods from the receptacle to the shutter; Figs. 8A to 8C are views illustrating a step of transfer of first layer
goods from the shutter to the table unit;Figs. 9A to 9C are views illustrating a step of transfer of second
layer goods from the goods receptacle to the shutter and thence to the table unit;Figs. 10A and 10B are views illustrating a step of transfer of goods
from the table unit to a container;Fig. 11 is a flow chart of a routine for calculation concerning the
assignment of goods receptacles and containers to individual customers with respect
to all kinds of ordered goods;Fig. 12 is a flow chart of a routine for calculation concerning the
assignment of goods receptacles to the individual customers;Fig. 13 is a flow chart of a routine for calculation concerning the
assignment of containers to the individual customers;Figs. 14A to 14C are schematic views illustrating a prior art method
of collecting goods on a goods receptacle;Figs. 15A to 15C are schematic views illustrating a method of
collecting goods on a goods receptacle according to the invention;Figs. 16A to 16C are schematic views illustrating a prior art method
of collecting goods in a container;Figs. 17A to 17E are schematic views illustrating a method of
collecting goods in a container according to the invention; andFig. 18 is a schematic illustration of a compacting function of a

<CLAIMS>
A goods reception conveyor (12) comprising a plurality of
goods receptacles (34) mounted on an endless chain to be conveyed in a

conveying direction for conveying box-shaped goods (1) placed on the
goods reception surface (35) of each goods receptacle (34),

   each goods receptacle having a goods reception surface inclined in
a direction crossing a conveying direction and including a movable

side wall (36) capable of opening and closing a zone on a lower end
side in the direction of inclination of the goods reception surface.
A goods collection apparatus for successively receiving
box-shaped goods (1) delivered from a plurality of goods delivery units in

predetermined quantities on a goods receptacle (34) and loading these goods in a vertical
stack of a plurality of stages in a container or the like comprising:


a goods reception conveyor
according to claim 1;
a shutter (13) disposed side-wise of the goods receptacle and including
a shutter member (44) capable of position change between a tilted position, at which

goods delivered from the goods receptacle are received, and a horizontal position,
at which the goods are delivered, the shutter member being opened at the horizontal

position to permit delivery of goods; and
a table unit (14) disposed beneath the shutter and including a stacking
table (52) for supporting goods delivered from the shutter, the stacking table being

capable of being raised and lowered to stack goods delivered from the shutter on
goods delivered earlier on the stacking table.
The goods collection apparatus according to claim 2, wherein the
shutter further includes a scraper (47) for stopping goods on and moved with the shutter

member when the shutter member is opened,

   the movable side wall of the goods receptacle and the scraper of the
shutter serving to stop perpendicular sides of goods, respectively. 
A goods collection method of successively receiving box-shaped
goods (1) delivered from a plurality of goods delivery units in

predetermined quantities on a goods receptacle (34) and loading these
goods in a vertical stack of a plurality of stages in a container or the

like utilising a structure with a goods receptacle having a goods
reception surface (35) inclined downward from the goods reception

side toward the other side, the goods receptacle including a movable
side wall (36) for opening and closing a side zone on the other side ;


the steps of the method comprising, gathering the goods received
on the goods receptacle onto the goods reception surface such as to be

on the side thereof adjacent the movable side wall in the closed state ;
opening the movable side wall of the goods receptacle to cause the

goods on the goods reception surface to slide and to be transferred to
a shutter member of a shutter (13) having substantially the same slope

of inclination as the goods reception surface, the shutter being
disposed side-wise of the goods receptacle ;
moving the shutter member of the shutter to a horizontal and
opened position to stack goods from the shutter member on a stacking

table of a table unit (14) disposed beneath the shutter ; and
gathering, transferring and stacking goods being carried out
repeatedly to collect goods in a vertical stack of a plurality of stages

on the stacking table by raising and lowering the stacking table to
stack goods delivered from the shutter on goods delivered earlier on

the stacking table.
