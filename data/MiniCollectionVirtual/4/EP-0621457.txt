<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sensor with a stable magnetic field, the air gap having a moving cable passed through it, characterised in that it comprises, on the one hand, a crown (8) fixed on the cable and formed by permanent magnets (3) which are arranged radially between an inner magnetic ring (2) and an outer magnetic ring (4), and, on the other hand, a fixed part formed by measurement elements (6, 7) fixed on a support delimiting a measurement space (10) in which the crown (8) is displaced. The invention applies in particular to measuring the sway of a cable or of a load.

<CLAIMS>
Stable magnetic field sensor comprising a fixed 
part and a movable part, characterized in that the 

movable part, which may be fixed to a cable, comprises a 
crown (8) of permanent magnets (3) arranged radially 

between an inner magnetic ring (2) and an outer magnetic 
ring (4) and that the fixed part is formed by measurement 

elements (6, 7) fixed to a support which defines a 
measurement space (10) in which the crown (8) moves. 
Sensor according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it furthermore comprises concentrators (11) placed 

on the support (5). 
Sensor according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that it comprises several magnets 

arranged on two measurement axes x and y. 
Sensor according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the measurement elements may be Hall-effect 

magnetoresistive or ultrasonic sensors. 
Sensor according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the measurement elements are direct 

measurement elements (6). 
Sensor according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the measurement elements (7) are pairs of 

differential elements (Ca - Cb).
