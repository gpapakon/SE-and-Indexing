<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceuticals 
formulations, in form of capsules for oral use, 
containing as the active ingredient ubidecarenone. Ubidecarenone, or coenzyme Q10, is a physiological 
element present in the cells as a component of the 
mitochondrial respiratory chain (De Pierre V.C. et al., 
Ann. Rev. Biochem., 46, 201, 1977; Nakamura T. et al., 
Chem. Pharm. Bull. 27, 1101, 1979). Ubidecarenone acts 
directly on the oxidative phosphorylation processes for 
the production of energy (formation of ATP) through 
metabolic, especially aerobical, pathways. The ubidecarenone requirements can increase in 
normal subjects who are subjected to intense physical 
fatigue or in subjects suffering from cardiovascular 
disorders, chronic debilitating diseases or subjected 
to chronic pharmacological treatments. Particularly, a 
lack in ubidecarenone has been evidenced in ischaemic 
cardiopathy, in senile miocardiosclerosis and in 
hypertensive cardiopathy (Yamagami T. et al., 
Biomedical and Clinical Aspects of Coenzyme Q10, 
Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press Vol. 3, 79, 
1981; Kishi T. et al., ibidem Vol. 3, 67). In such 
pathologies, the supply of exogenous ubidecarenone 
involves remarkable improvements as well as important 
therapeutical results (Yamasawa G., Biomedical and 
Clinical Aspects of Coenzime Q10, Elsevier/North-Holland 
Biomedical Press Vol. 2, 333, 1980). Ubidecarenone is a lipophilic, low melting solid, 
practically insoluble in water. Such characteristics  
 
restrict its capability of dissolution in 
gastrointestinal fluids, when it is administered in 
conventional formulations containing it in solid form 
(tablets, capsules, suspensions for reconstitution 
before use). Italian Patent Application N° 001919 A/91 
discloses preparations in form of aqueous solutions for 
the oral use containing ubidecarenone dissolved by 
means of hydrogenated polyethoxylated 40 castor oil, a 
non-ionic surfactant compatible to oral use. The 
dissolution of ubidecarenone allows to attain blood 
levels of the active ingredient higher and more 
protracted than those obtained with a conventional 
preparation in suspension for reconstitution before 
use. Japanese Patent 55081813 discloses preparations in 
soft capsules containing ubidecarenone dissolved in a 
mixture of neutral oils with surfactants. The following 
neutral oils are cited: soy-bean oil, peanut oil, 
cottonseed oil, cod-liver oil, fatty acids 
triglycerides; a number of different surfactants are 
described, particularly,

<CLAIMS>
Pharmaceutical formulations in form of capsules 
for oral use, containing as the active ingredient 

ubidecarenone dispersed in a mixture of isopropyl 
myristate or isopropyl palmitate with polyethoxylated, 

hydrogenated or non hydrogenated castor oils. 
Formulations according to claim 1 wherein the oily 
carrier, preferably isopropyl myristate, is present in 

amounts ranging from 1 to 5 times the weight of the 
active ingredient, preferably 2 times the weight. 
Formulations according to claims 1 and 2, wherein 
polyethoxylated castor oils, preferably hydrogenated 

polyethoxylated 40 castor oils, are present in amounts 
from 1 to 5 times the weight of the active ingredient, 

preferably 3 times the weight. 
Formulations according to claims 1-3 wherein the 
oily phase (ubidecarenone + oily carrier) : 

polyethoxylated castor oil ratio ranges from 1:0.3 to 
1:2.5, preferably 1:1. 
Formulations according to any one of the above 
claims, wherein the active ingredient can be dissolved 

in an aqueous medium with a resulting increase in 
bioavailability. 
Formulations according to any one of the above 
claims, containing ubidecarenone in amounts ranging 

from 5 to 100 mg, preferably from 20 to 60 mg. 
A process for the preparation of the formulations 
of claims 1-6, which process comprises dissolving at 50 

C° ubidecarenone in a mixture of isopropyl myristate or 
 

isopropyl palmitate with polyethoxylated, hydrogenated 
or non hydrogenated, castor oil, cooling to room 

temperature and filling in gelatin capsules. 
A process according to claim 7, wherein the 
formulation is filled into gelatin capsules. 
The use of isopropyl myristate and hydrogenated 
polyethoxylated 40 castor oil for the preparation of 

capsules for the oral use of ubidecarenone capable of 
giving blood levels of the active ingredient higher and 

more protracted in time than those obtainable with 
conventional oral solid formulations.
