<ABSTRACT>
A beverage container 1 has two sub-compartments 2,3, the 
larger sub-compartment 2 containing a dark coloured 

liqueur and having a capacity of approximately twice that 
of the smaller compartment 3 which contains a white cream 

liqueur. The difference in specific gravity between the 
liqueurs is approximately 0.03g/litre so that the white 

liqueur floats on top of the dark liqueur when the 
liqueurs are poured into a glass.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to beverages and in particular to a 
beverage delivery system. Beverage technology is concerned with the introduction of 
new liquid taste sensations by combining taste and flavour 
combinations in novel ways. In conventional systems a 
liquid beverage is provided as a single liquid with 
definite mouth feel and similar characteristics. There 
have been attempts to provide immiscible or non-homogenous 
liquids in a bottle, however, such systems require the 
consumer to mix the contents of the bottle prior to 
pouring to ensure that a homogenous product is delivered. This invention is directed towards providing a novel 
system for delivering beverages. More particularly, the invention relates to a liquid 
beverages container in combination with a dark beverage 
and a white cream liqueur beverage. The container comprises a first compartment and a second 
compartment. US-A-2,826,338 describes a container of this 
type. The invention is characterised in that a liquid beverages 
container in combination with a dark beverage and a white 
cream liqueur beverage, the container comprising: 
a first compartment; and a second compartment separate from the first one; the dark beverage being located in the first 
compartment, and having a density of from 1.0875 to 
1.0950 g/litre; the white cream liqueur beverage being located in the 
second compartment, and having a density of from 1.051 
to 1.057 g/litre;  
 the difference in specific gravity of the beverages being such that 
the dark beverage and white cream liqueur remain 
substantially separate when the beverages are poured 
from the compartments into a receptacle. Most preferably the difference in specific gravity of the 
beverages is approximately 0.03g/litre. Typically the white cream liqueur includes alcohol, sugar 
syrup and a cream blend including dairy cream and 
caseinate. In one embodiment of the invention the dark beverage 
includes a coffee flavour ingredient. Alternatively or 
preferably additionally the dark beverage includes a 
chocolate flavour ingredient. Preferably the dark 
beverage includes alcohol and sugar syrup. In an especially preferred embodiment of the invention the 
first compartment is defined by a first bottle and the 
second compartment is defined by a second bottle attached 
to the first bottle. In one embodiment of the invention the capacity of one of 
the bottles is approximately twice the capacity of the 
other bottle. The invention will be more clearly understood from the 
following description thereof
