<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a method of producing a well-integrated 
laminate material, for example a packaging laminate, in which method a 

first web (10a) of plastic, and a second web (10b) of plastic are brought 
together and permanently united to one another by the simultaneous 

application of heat and pressure, for the formation of the laminate material 
(10). In order to improve the adhesion between the 
webs (10a and 10b), 
these are subjected to a surface-activating treatment of non-chemical 

nature, preferably a corona treatment, prior to the uniting of the webs, 
whereby good adhesion and bonding between the webs is achieved 

without the employment of interjacent chemical adhesives. 
The method is preferably reduced into practice employing rollers (20 
and 21) which are of different hardnesses, the relatively softer roller (20) 

being disposed to be movable in relation to the relatively harder roller (21) 
in such a manner that the nip between the rollers (20 and 21) through which 

both of the united webs are led may be adjusted at a suitable pressure, and 
that the nip obtains a certain width or extent in the linear direction of the 

webs as a result of the penetration of the relatively harder roller (21) into the 
surface of the compressing, relatively softer roller (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing a laminate 
material, for example packaging laminate, in which method a first web of 
plastic and a second web of plastic are brought together and permanently 
united with one another under simultaneous application of heat and 
pressure. Packaging laminates comprising united layers of plastic and/or other 
materials are often employed for packages of the single-use disposable 
type, and there occur on the market not only simple, flexible packaging 
laminates comprising a limited number of layers, but also complex, rigid 
packaging laminates comprising a plurality of layers in expediently selected 
mutual combinations. Irrespective of whether the packaging material is of one type or the 
other, it is important that the composition of the individual packaging 
laminate be such that a package produced from the packaging laminate is 
given the best possible operative preconditions to be capable of storing a 
product in a manner which reliably safeguards the product. Thus, the 
requirements on the packaging laminate are that it must possess not only 
mechanical and chemical but also other desirable - and necessary - 
properties in order to make for adequate product protection, at the same 
time as the packaging laminate must, naturally, be economically viable and 
easy to produce and form into packages on a rational industrial scale. One conventional packaging laminate for configurationally stable 
single-use disposable packages comprises a core layer of paper or 
paperboard which imparts to the package the requisite mechanical strength 
and configurational stability, and outer coatings of thermoplastic, preferably 
polyethylene, which impart to the package tightness properties in respect of 
moisture and liquid. The outer thermoplastic coatings also possess the 
advantage that they are heat-sealable (or fusible) in such a way that 
mutually facing thermoplastic surfaces may be brought to surface fusion 
and bonding with one another under the application of heat and pressure,  
 
for the formation of mechanically strong and liquid-tight sealing seams or 
joints during the reforming of the packaging laminate into packages. Another conventional packaging laminate for the above-described 
type of single-use packages also comprises a core layer of paper or 
paperboard and outer coatings of thermoplastic, preferably polyethylene, 
and moreover one or more additional layers of material which are intended 
to impart to the package supplementary tightness

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a laminate material, for example packaging 
laminate, in which method a first web (10a; 10'a) of plastic and a second 

web (10b; 10'b) of plastic are brought together and permanently united with 
one another under simultaneous application of heat and pressure, 

characterized in that the webs (10a; 10b; 10'a; 10'b) are subjected, for 
purposes of promoting adhesion, to a surface activation treatment prior to 

unification of the webs. 
The method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the 
first (10a; 10'a) and/or the second web (10b; 10'b) consist of or have a 

thermoplastic coating (12; 12') which has been extruded at a temperature 
(Te) which is considerably higher than the normal melting temperature (Tm) 

of the extruded thermoplastic, i.e. Te«Tm. 
The method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the webs (10a; 10b; 10'a; 10b) are surface activated by corona-treating 

and/or ozone. 
The method as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that the webs (10a; 10b; 10'a; 10'b) are united with one 

another and together led through the nip between rotating rollers (20; 21; 
20'; 21') in one or more pairs of such rollers of mutually different surface 

hardnesses, the relatively softer roller (20; 20') in each respective roller pair 
being pressed against the relatively harder roller (21; 21'), and each 

respective roller nip being kept at mutually different temperatures (T1, T2, 
T3) which increase in the linear running direction of the webs, i.e. 

T1
<
T2
<
T3. 
The method as claimed in Claim 4, characterized in that the 
relatively harder roller (21; 21') in each respective roller pair (20; 21; 20'; 

21') consists of one and the same roller common to all roller pairs, the 
relatively softer rollers (20; 20') in each respective roller pair being 

peripherally distributed about the periphery of the common roller (21'). 
The method as claimed in Claim 4 or 5, characterized in that 
the relatively harder roller (21; 21') in each respective roller pair is supplied 

with heat for transferring to the bypassing webs (10a; 10b; 10'a; 10'b). 
The method as claimed in any one of Claims 4 to 6, 
characterized in that the relatively harder roller (21; 21') in each 

 
respective roller pair includes a rubber-clad, cylindrical roller core of steel, 

while the relatively softer roller (20; 20') consists of steel. 
The method as claimed in Claim 7, characterized in that the 
relatively harder roller (21; 21') and/or the relatively softer roller (20; 20') in 

each respective roller pair have an outer coating of Teflon® or other heat 
resistant material which is non-stick in relation to the plastic in the second 

web (10'b). 
The method as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that the first web (10a; 10'a) has an outer coating (12;
