<ABSTRACT>
A noise shielding apparatus for the magnetron of a 
microwave oven is disclosed, in which the structure is 

relatively simple, so that the material cost would be 
saved, and that the productivity would be improved. An 

elliptic opening (111) is formed on a side wall of a 
shielding case (100) for installing a capacitor (130). The 

circumference of the opening (111) is bent to form a 
projected portion (110) for attaching a capacitor (130), 

and a recess (113) is formed on the reverse side of the 
projected portion (110). Further, reinforcing ribs (112) 

are formed around the projected portion (110) of the 
shielding case (100). In the present invention, attaching 

a conventional separate ground fitment is unnecessary, so 
that the productivity would be improved. Further, since 

the holes for fastening the ground fitment are not 
required, the noise is not leaked through the holes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a noise shielding
apparatus in which a noise generated in a magnetron of a
microwave oven can be effectively shielded. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a noise
shielding apparatus in which the structure of the
shielding apparatus is simple, but the performance is very
high, so that the productivity can be improved, and that
the overall manufacturing cost can be saved.Generally, various apparatuses such as home microwave
ovens, commercial thawing apparatuses, industrial driers
and the like using microwaves are provided with a
magnetron for generating microwaves, and a capacitor for
shielding noises.In an electric field room of a microwave oven, there
is provided a magnetron for generating microwaves. Such
microwaves are generated when a high voltage produced by
primary and secondary induction coils of a high voltage
transformer which is attached on a base plate of the
electric field room, is stably supplied to the magnetron,
the high voltages being generated through the inductive
interaction between the induction coils. Such microwaves
are irradiated into a cooking chamber through an
irradiating tube. When the microwaves are irradiated into the cooking
chamber after passing through the irradiating tube, the
food placed within the cooking chamber is heated so as to
be cooked.The power supply line of the magnetron is mainly
consisted of a filament, a cathode and an anode. When the
high voltage is supplied to the magnetron to generate
microwaves, unnecessarily radiated microwaves, i.e.,
noises are generated, besides microwaves having basic
frequencies which are suitable for heating the food. Then,
the noises flow back through the filament and the cathode
so as to cause wave obstructions in the nearby
apparatuses.Particularly, coming recently, television broadcasts
resorting to satellites are widely utilized. The
unnecessary microwaves of the magnetron interacts with the
broadcasting frequencies and therefore there is a
possibility that receiving disorders may occur on a
television receiver.In order to reduce such adverse influences given to
the nearby apparatuses due to the magnetron noise, a choke
coil and a capacitor connected thereto are provided on the
cathode which supplies power to the filament. The choke
coil which has a reactance, and the capacitor which is
connected to the choke coil absorb the unnecessary
microwaves, thereby blocking the leakage of the
unnecessary microwaves.The choke coil is sealed within a shielding case 
which is provided
