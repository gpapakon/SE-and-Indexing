<ABSTRACT>
Time of occurrence of an event, such as completion of 
rotation of a body, is determined by generating in response 

to the sensed occurrence of the event, a signal having a 
parameter whose value varies according to a predetermined 

function of time from an initial value at an initial time 
correlated to the time of occurrence of the event. At a 

subsequent time later than the initial time, a subsequent 
value of the parameter is determined and the time of 

occurrence of the event is determined by subtracting from 
the subsequent time, an amount of time calculated 

substantially according to the function as elapsing between 
the initial value and the subsequent value. By determining 

the times of completions of their respective rotations in 
this manner, the relative rotational phase and/or relative 

rotational velocities of rotating bodies, such as tyre/ 
wheel assemblies of a moving vehicle, can be determined 

with precision.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to precise measurement of the 
times at which certain events, such as complete revolutions 
of wheels, take place and for measuring relative velocity 
and phase relationships based on those times. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to methods and 
apparatus well-suited for making such measurements on-board 
a moving vehicle. The wheels of automobiles or other vehicles equipped 
with pneumatic tyres do not always rotate in phase with one 
another nor do they necessarily rotate the same angular 
velocity as one another at any given time. Large 
differences in phase and angular velocity among the wheels 
of a vehicle can arise due to external factors such as 
reduced traction caused by acceleration, braking or changes 
in steer direction of the vehicle. Less dramatic but still 
significant differences in those parameters, even with 
respect to wheels on the same axle, are also known to occur 
as an automobile travels in a straight ahead direction 
without braking or accelerating. These can arise due to a 
number of influences such as the operational characteristics 
of the differential of the vehicle, structural non-uniformities 
in the tyres, variances in effective rolling 
radii among the tyre/wheel assemblies or uneven 
distribution of the weight of the vehicle. In order to 
study these influences as well as to measure on a vehicle 
the effective radius or other parameters characterizing its 
tyre/wheel assemblies, it is important to be able to 
determine with precision when an event, such as completion 
of a full revolution of wheel rotation, occurs. U.S. Patent 4,479,382 to Greenhorn et al. discloses a 
micro-processor based system for measuring the average 
effective rolling radius of a tyre on a tyre uniformity 
test machine and suggests that such measurements are useful 
for predicting the tendency of a vehicle to exhibit an 
undesirable and potentially dangerous handling condition  
 
known as torque steer. In that system, a photo-sensitive 
detector and a tachometer are used to provide the microprocessor 
with respective series of angularly spaced pulses 
as a load wheel and tyre rotate in contact with one another 
under a radial load. Under such load, the tyre deforms as 
it would under the weight of a vehicle while the load 
wheel, being rigid, maintains its normal fixed radius. To measure average effective rolling radius according 
to Greenhorn et al. '382, the tyre and load wheel are first 
brought up to a desired rotational speed while under a 
radial
