<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hook (iris retractor) having at least one hook-shaped insertion member for retraction of the iris in eye surgery. The hook (25) comprises a hook-shaped element (10) which is provided with an arched section (12) and is made of a flexible thermoplastic thread, as well as a fixation element (20) which is adjustably located thereon and has two holes arranged at a distance from one another for passing through the thread-like hook-shaped element (10) and can be deformed such that the hook (25) which is inserted by the arched section (12) at the region (3'') of the iris (3) is retained at the transition (5) from the cornea (2) to the sclera (7) and can be withdrawn by a pulling movement (Z) oriented relative to the eye (1).

<CLAIMS>
Surgical hook for use during surgical treatment on the
eye (1) of a living organism, comprising a hook element

(10) made of a flexible plastic thread provided on at
least one end with a moulded-on, hook-shaped engaging

part (15) and with an elongated guide part (11) for
localised retraction of the iris (3) and comprising a

fixing element (20) displaceably arranged on the guide
part (11), with which the surgical hook (25) inserted

through an incision in the cornea (2) can be held against
the outer contour of the eye (1), characterised in that

the plastic thread is thermoplastic and the hook element
(10) with the moulded-on engaging part (15) in the bent-over

region (12) thereof has a locally restricted
rigidity, which differs from the rigidity of the rest of

the plastic thread and is less than the resistance acting
on the engaging part (15) as a result of the retracted

iris (3'') when engaged or as a result of the cornea (2)
when disengaged, so that when the surgical hook (25) is

drawn out from the eye (1), the bent-over region of the
engaging part (15) may be bent upwards into a

substantially straight position by the resistance.
Surgical hook according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the hook-shaped engaging part (15) is moulded on the hook

element (10) by a thermal treatment.
Surgical hook according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the hook element (10) provided with the moulded-on

engaging part (15) is made from a polyamide thread.
Surgical hook according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the fixing element (20) is constructed as a flexible

disc, which with respect to its axis of symmetry has at
least two spaced holes (23, 23'), through which the guide

part (11) of the thread-like hook element (10) may be 
passed.
Surgical hook according to Claim 4, characterised in that
when pushed onto the hook element (10), the fixing

element (20) has an inherent rigidity, as a result of
which the fixing element (20) adjustable in the

longitudinal direction of the guide part (11) may be
fixed in any desired position in a self-locking manner.
Surgical hook according to Claims 4 and 5, characterised
in that the fixing element (20) is constructed such that

when pushed on, it forms two spaced part-sections (21,
21'), which may be compressed for adjustment of the

fixing element (20), on one side of the guide part (11)
and forms an arc-shaped abutment (22) on the other side,

by means of which abutment (22) the fixing element (20)
is held and supported against the eye (1).
Surgical hook according to Claim 4, characterised in that
the fixing element (20) is constructed as a disc

penetrated by the spaced holes (23, 23') oriented
transversely to the surface and is made of flexible

material, whereby the external shaping of the disc-shaped
fixing element (20) is circular, elliptic, square or

rectangular in construction.
Surgical hook according to Claims 4 to 7, characterised

in that the fixing element (20) is made of silicon
caoutchouc or the like.
