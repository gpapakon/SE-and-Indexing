<ABSTRACT>
Interactive television system which by means of a keyboard 
(1c) can communicate via, for example, the local cable network (9) 

with a central computer (6), which supplies teletext pages to a 
user's television screen (8). To this end, the central computer (6) 

first selects a teletext page number, which is displayed to the 
user on a display unit (1a), after which the user can tune the 

television screen to the teletext page displayed before the central 
computer transmits the desired teletext page.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an interactive television system. It is known to request teletext pages with the aid of a telephone 
handset and the telephone network. However, this has the 
disadvantage that it is not possible for a user to enter 
alphanumeric information using a standard telephone handset. Furthermore, 
the telephone network has the disadvantage that large 
scale communal use is not possible because of the limited availability 
of the number of telephone lines. The object of the invention is to provide an installation and 
a method with which a user can request the teletext information he 
or she desires whilst many others, for example hundreds of others, 
can do the same at the same time. To this end the invention provides an interactive television 
system at least comprising: 
a user station provided with a keyboard, a keyboard processor 
and a display unit; first input/output means connected on one side to the user 
station and on the other side to a network; a central computer at least provided with a memory loaded 
with several application programs; second input/output means connected on one side to the network 
and on the other side to the central computer; an inserter connected to the central computer and to the 
network and intended to supply preselected data originating 
from the memory to the network; a television screen for displaying the data originating from 
the memory. By employing a keyboard at the user end, the user has more 
possibilities than before for supplying desired information to the 
network. Moreover, as a result of these measures a quasi-simultaneous 
return path for communication from the user station to the 
central computer can be achieved without the use of repeaters in 
the return path of the network. The first input/output means are preferably connected to the 
user station via an infra-red interface. In a preferred embodiment the network is also connected to  
 
other user stations via other respective first input/output means. It is particularly advantageous to allow the communication 
between each of the user stations and the central computer via the 
network to proceed via time division multiplexing of data, whilst 
the network is preferably a cable network, a protocol computer 
being located between the second input/output means and the central 
computer to manage the connected user stations logged on at the 
same time. By employing these measures use can be made of the bus 
structure of the cable network, as a result of which a large number 
of users,
