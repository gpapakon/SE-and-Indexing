<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of isophorone (3,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one) 
and mesityl oxide (4-methyl-3-penten-2-one) 
via aldol condensation of acetone. More particularly this 
invention relates to the use of a calcined magnesium/aluminum 
mixed oxide catalyst for the aforesaid process in order to selectively 
produce isophorone. Gas phase aldol condensation of acetone is well known and a 
number of methods have been disclosed for converting acetone into 
a wide variety of products, particularly isophorone and mesityl 
oxide, which are used in industrial solvents and as chemical 
intermediates for resins, dyes, and the like. In addition numerous 
by-products and low value high boilers and tars are also produced. 
Thus there is a strong desire in the art to control the condensation 
of the acetone to produce mainly isophorone and mesityl oxide, 
minimize the formation of by-products, and to control the molar 
ratio of these two products and various types of catalysts have been 
proposed to purportedly achieve such results. For instance U.S. Patent 4,970,171 advances the use of a 
polymorphic magnesium-aluminum oxide composition as a 
catalyst for aldol condensation of acetone to isophorone, said 
catalyst having been prepared by mixing a pseudoboehimite and 
acid solution to form a gel which is then reacted with magnesium 
oxide (or hydroxide) to form a mixed metal (e.g. magnesium and 
aluminum) hydroxide which is subsequently dried and calcined. 
U.S. Patent 5,153,156 is directed to spray drying a slurry of a 
synthetic clay of magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, then  
 
plasticizing, drying and calcining the mixture into a desired aldol 
condensation catalst for producing isophorone. U.S. Patent 
4,458,026 discloses the use of a catalyst which is described as a "Mg-Al-CO₃ 
Hydrotalcite Catalyst", prepared by precipitation using 
water soluble salts such as Mg(NO₃)₂·6H₂O and Al₂(NO₃)₃·9H₂O 
together with sodium carbonate, for the production of isophorone. 
U.S. Patent 5,144,089 promotes the production of 2-ethyl-2-hexenal 
by aldol condensation using a solid solution of magnesium oxide-aluminum 
oxide as the catalyst. The use of various other mixed 
metal oxide catalysts for isophorone preparation via aldol 
condensation of acetone are discussed in U.S. Patent 4,535,187 
which promotes the use of a catalyst prepared by introducing an 
inorganic or organic calcium salt onto an alumina support. In 
contrast the present invention employs a catalyst composition 
containing magnesium and
