<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for controlling a 
regenerating operation in an industrial electrical motor car 
employing a direct current motor, such as a battery driven 
fork lift truck, etc., and more particularly to an apparatus and 
a method for controlling a regenerating operation which 
charges the battery with an induced electromotive force 
generated by an armature of the direct current motor in the 
state of a power running mode. Conventional industrial electric motor car has, running 
signal input means for receiving signals inputted from a 
running accelerator, unloading signal input means for receiving 
unloading signals, means for changing modes between 
regeneration and power running, means for discriminating a 
regenerable state, a control unit for outputting a predetermined 
signal in response to the signals inputted from each of the 
signal input means, and a magnetic contactor which is driven 
by the predetermined control signal outputted from the control 
means. Thus, a discriminating operation for control of  
 
regeneration mode has been performed. In the prior art, upon operation of a running lever in the 
electric motor car, the control unit outputs a pulse signal with 
a predetermined period to a running switching element, 
allowing flow of an armature current when the pulse signal is 
turned on state and flow of a plugging current generated from 
the armature when it is turned off state. In such a prior art, the control unit discriminates whether 
or not the plugging current exceeds a predetermined level 
during the generation of the predetermined number of the 
pulses(i.e., within a predetermined period), and when exceeding 
the level, it is considered to be a regenerable state, and then 
the regeneration control has been performed. On the other hand, when the plugging current does not 
exceed the level within the predetermined discriminating 
period, it is considered to be a power running state, and then 
the power running control has been performed. However, in the prior art, there was a disadvantage in that 
the control unit must be provided with separate plugging 
current detecting means to discriminate the regenerable state, 
resulting in complicated structure and high manufacturing 
cost. Another disadvantages of the prior art is that the response 
performance and the arruracy of the discrimination are 
inferior.  Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a regeneration/power running control system of which 
the accuracy of the
