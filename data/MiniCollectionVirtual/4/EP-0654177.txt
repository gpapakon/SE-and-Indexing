<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a semiconductor arrangement which comprises a semiconductor body (10), a plurality of dielectric layers (11, 12) partly covering at least one of its surfaces, at least one layer (13) of applied polycrystalline semiconductor material and at least one metallised layer (14), which is applied to the semiconductor body (10) provided with the dielectric layers (11, 12) in such a way that it lies directly on the surface regions of the semiconductor body (10) not covered by the dielectric layers or lies on the surface regions of the semiconductor body (10) on at least one of the dielectric layers (11, 12) which act as conductive path regions. Within said conductive path regions, several parts of at least one conductive path (14) are raised at repeated distances by underlying webs from the layer (13) of applied polycrystalline semiconductor material or recessed by recesses in the oxide, so that the metallised layer (14) is corrugated inside said conductive path regions.
