The umbilical (2) comprises a core element (5), a plurality of conduits (7) and/or cables (8) situated outside the core element (5), filler material around and between the conduits/cables and a protective sheath surrounding the conduits and filler material. The finished cable cord is characterized in that the filler material is in the form of inner, elongate channel elements (6) having outwardly opening channels, adapted for receipt of the conduits/cables, and outer, elongate channel elements (9) having inwardly opening channels adapted for receipt and final enclosure of the conduits/cables.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing
and laying a plurality of elongate elements into a cable
cord, or umbilical, comprising a core element, a plurality of
conduits and/or cables situated outside the core element,
filler material around and between the conduits/cables and
optionally a protective sheath surrounding the conduits and
filler material, which core element is advanced along a feed
line and the conduits and/or cables are fed onto the outside
of the core element and laid in a helix.The invention also relates to a machine for manufacturing of
such an umbilical, which machine comprises a pulling means
specifically for the core element and reels of coiled
conduits and/or cables, which reels are spaced apart around
the core element, and are rotatable about the core element
for helical laying thereon, and pulling means acting on the
conduits and/or cables.From British patent application GB-2038988 there is known a
method and means for producing a multi-pipe conduit from a
plurality of pipes and a central core as said pipes and
central core are drawn in their longitudinal direction. The
pipes are secured at the contact end in a non-twisted
relationship around the central core.GB-A-2 192 966 shows a method and an apparatus
for producing helically wound pipe bundles. A group of pipes
is wound together to form a continuous combination conduit
from the individual supply pipes, conduits and cables that
are intended to be laid in one operation in bundled form from
a lay vessel at sea. Further examples of the prior art are shown in GB-1141014,
GB-1210206 and GB-1423059. An example of a previously
proposed pipe bundle cable is shown in
EP-A-0 177 475.The present umbilical is a further development of the
concept shown in EP-A-0 177 475. The umbilical is
a composite structure capable of transporting hydraulic
fluids, chemicals, electrical and optical signals and
electrical power. The conduit for chemical transport is
usually placed in the center, while those for electrical
signals and power and the hydraulic pipes are placed
peripherally around the central element or core element. The
peripherally situated elements are wound into a helix around
the central pipe. Each element is free to move longitudinally
in relation to the other elements. The cable cord is
wrapped with a band, and the outer sheath is a thermoplastic
layer extruded onto the cable cord.The types of materials used are evaluated and selected on the
basis of information about the medium to be transported, the
expected lifetime

A method of manufacturing and laying a plurality of elongate
elements into an umbilical (2) comprising a core element (5),

a plurality of conduits (7) and/or cables (8) situated

between the conduits/cables and optionally a protective
sheath (1) surrounding the conduits and filler material,

which core element (5) is advanced along a feed line and the
conduits (7) and/or cables (8) are fed onto the outside of

the core element (5) and laid in a helix,
characterized in
 that some of the filler
material, in the form of inner, elongate channel elements

(6), is first fed in helical form onto the outside of the
core element (5), whereafter the conduits (7) and/or cables

(8) are introduced flush with the channels (21) in channel
element (6), and that the remaining filler material, in the

form of outer channel elements (9), is then fed in helical
form onto the outside of the conduits (7) and/or cables (8)

such that the channels (22) in the channel elements (9) are
flush with the conduits/cables, as all of the elongate

elements are laid and held together as a collective bundle
and form said umbilical (2).
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in

that the elongate channel elements (6, 9) are brought
together as they are being laid, and are held together with

the aid of self-locking means (20) on the longitudinal edges
of the channel elements (6, 9).
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in

that a band is wrapped helically around the elongate
elements (6,7,8,9) to further ensure that the elements are

held together after the laying. 
Method according to claims 1-3, 
characterized in

that the protective sheath (1) is applied as a final
production step in a continuous operation after the laying--alternatively

as a separate, subsequent operation.
