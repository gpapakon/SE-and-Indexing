<ABSTRACT>
A method of reading use-variable data from a smart card (1) includes selected data in the answer-to-reset signal sent from the card in response to a reset signal sent from a card reader (4). In this way a reader can be employed with inexpensive components and limited processing power since full implementation of a communication protocol is not required. An inexpensive key-fob (3) is provided for reading the value balance (7) of an electronic purse card, for example.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to data reading from a
smart card. A smart card, otherwise known as an
integrated circuit card, is a card carrying a
microprocessor, memory, and an interface for
electrical coupling to read/write devices. Preferably
the memory is non-volatile, by which is meant memory
which retains information in the absence of electrical
power. Typically, memories used in smart cards are of
the Electronic Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory
(EEPROM) type. Such cards may be used for many
purposes, such as for carrying personal information,
perhaps for example medical information or for
personal identification purposes. Alternatively, such
cards may be used as bank cards or payment cards. An
application for smart cards to which the present
invention is particularly, but not exclusively,
applicable is as electronic purses. Electronic purses
hold value data which may be uploaded and downloaded
by communication with a bank or other financial
institution. Value may be exchanged between
electronic purses which are coupled by a data link.
Thus purchases may be made, using the value data as
"electronic cash". Smart cards can carry an
appreciable amount of information in a secure manner.
Data in the card may include fixed data set at
manufacture, such as a card serial number or the like.
However this fixed data is not of interest to users.
The card is used to input, store and output variable
data. Although some of this data may in practice not
be changed after first being input, it is different
from data fixed by the manufacturer of the card and is
use-variable data. More usually, use-variable data is 
data changed regularly in the normal use of the card. Smart card use-variable
data is read to and from the card serially via the contacts using an
established protocol.The read protocol as exemplified in ISO protocol 7816 which
requires that when coupling is established between a reader and the card,
the reader applies power and clock and reset signals to the card
microprocessor. Then, an Answer to Reset (ATR) sequence of data bytes
is transmitted from card to reader. Thereafter the card may be
interrogated by the reader to transmit demanded use-variable data. US-A-5
034 596 describes such a card processing apparatus, whereby an IC
card is inserted into a card reader/writer, which upon insertion of the card
feeds the power and reset signal to the card for activating the operation of
this card. The activated card then outputs the initial response data signal
ATR to the data reading/writing unit. The data is
