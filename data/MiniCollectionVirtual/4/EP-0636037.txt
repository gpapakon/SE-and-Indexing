Anaesthetist's equipment comprising a narcotization device (2) for supplying 
make-up gas (5), a respirator (3) for supporting or performing the respiration of 

the patient and a narcotization system (4) for performing the actual gas 
exchange between the equipment and the patient, in which the narcotization 

system (4) comprises an inspiratory (10) and an expiratory arm (7) which are 
connected together by a patient T-shaped connection tube (38), with a 

pressure generator (29) arranged in the inspiratory arm (10) for the respirator 
(3) and a downstream inspiration valve (18) and an expiration valve or outlet 

valve (13, 27) arranged in the expiratory arm (7) and with a connecting line (25, 
25') between the inspiratory and the expiratory arm (7, 10) for producing a half-closed, 

closed or half-open narcotization system, characterised in that the 
pressure generator (29) is designed as an alternating pressure gas storage unit 

(29) to which a controllable drive device (30) is assigned at least for increasing 
the stroke volume of the gas storage unit (29), the expiratory gas (9') of the 

patient (6) can be guided via the expiratory arm (7) and via the connecting line 
(25, 25') in an adjustable amount to the gas storage unit (29), whereby a 

controllable or regulatable overflow valve (27) in the expiratory arm (7) 
determines the amount of respiratory gas to be drawn off and the gas content 

of the gas storage unit (29) put under pressure in the inspiration phase can be 
removed via a controllable or regulatable inspiration valve (18). 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised in that the respiratory gas for 
performing the inspiration at high pressure in the gas storage unit (29) is kept 

ready and is controlled by the inspiration valve (18) and the pressure in the gas 
storage unit (29) is reduced during the expiration phase so much that the 

expiratory gas flowing back from the patient via the connecting line (25) is 
collected completely or partly in the gas storage unit (29). 
Equipment according to claim 1, characterised in that on partly recycling the 
expiration gas in the gas storage unit (29) the excess expiration gas is removed 

via the overflow valve (27).  
 
Equipment according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the expiration 
valve (13) as a peep valve generates a continually positive respiratory path 

pressure. 
Equipment according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
make-up gas is supplied to the patient via a supply line (37) in the inspiratory 

arm (10) which is arranged in front or after the inspiration valve (18). 
Equipment according to claim 5, characterised in that the make-up gas is 
supplied continually or discontinually to the gas storage unit (29) and/or to the 

patient (6) via a make-up gas supply line (37, 37'). 
Equipment according to one of the preceding claims characterised in that the 
gas storage unit (29) comprises a fixed (31) and a moving plate (32), whereby 

the moving plate (32) can be driven by a spring system (34) to reduce the 
stroke volume. 
Equipment according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
pressure relief and/or the drive of the gas storage unit (29) is performed by a 

pneumatic or electric control device and in particular a pneumatic or electric 
piston/cylinder unit (30). 
Equipment according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
connecting line (25) comprises a check valve (26) which is closed during the 

inspiration phase. 
Equipment according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that in 
the expiratory arm an expiration valve (13) and an overflow valve (27) are 

arranged as controllable valves whereby the connecting line (25) branches 
between the valves (13, 27). 
Equipment according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that in 
the expiratory arm a check valve (39) is provided which during the inspiration 

phase closes the expiratory arm (7) from the inspiratory arm (10) and the  
 

overflow valve is designed as a combined overflow, expiration and/or peep 
valve (27'). 
Equipment according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
expiratory arm (7) leads via a connecting line (25') to an inspiratory arm (10) to 

the respiration gas return to the gas storage unit (29) and to the inspiratory arm 
(10) a combined overflow, expiration and/or peep valve (27') is connected. 
Equipment according to claim 12, characterised in that the return line (25') from 
the expiratory (7) to the inspiratory arm (10) between the patient and check 

valve (18) exits in the inspiratory arm (10) and a bypass line (45) with a check 
valve (47) bridges the controllable inspiration valve (18) whereby the check 

valve (47) is closed in the inspiration phase. 
Equipment according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that a 
connectable hand respiration device (49) with an on-off valve (48) is assigned 

to the inspiratory arm (10). 
Equipment according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
alternating pressure gas storage unit (29) in connection with the controllable 

inspiration valve (18) and an additional trigger device (50) can supply the gas 

requirement of a spontaneously breathing patient. 
Equipment according to claim 15, characterised in that the trigger device (50) 
can provide the patient with spontaneous respiration with an inspiration 

respiratory aid.
