<ABSTRACT>
Serine proteases of the chymotrypsin superfamily are modified so that they exhibit resistance to serine protease inhibitors. If such modified serine proteases have fibrinolytic, thrombolytic, antithrombotic or prothrombotic properties, they are useful in the treatment of blood clotting diseases or conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to serine proteases of the
chymotrypsin superfamily which have been modified so that
they exhibit resistance to serine protease inhibitors.
The invention also relates to the precursors of such
compounds, their preparation, to nucleic acid coding for
them and to their pharmaceutical use.Serine proteases are endopeptidases which use serine as
the nucleophile in peptide bond cleavage. There are two
known superfamilies of serine proteases and these are the
chymotrypsin superfamily and the Streptomyces subtilisin
superfamily (Barrett, A.J., in: Proteinase Inhibitors,
Ed. Barrett, A.J. et al., Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp 3-22
(1986) and James, M.N.G., in: Proteolysis and
Physiological Regulation, Ed. Ribbons, D.W. etal,
Academic Press, New York, pp 125-142 (1976)).The present invention is particularly concerned with
serine proteases of the chymotrypsin superfamily which
includes such compounds as plasmin, tissue plasminogen
activator (t-PA), urokinase-type plasminogen activator
(u-PA), trypsin, chymotrypsin, granzyme, elastase,
acrosin, tonin, myeloblastin, prostate-specific antigen
(PSA), gamma-renin, tryptase, snake venom serine
proteases, adipsin, protein C, cathepsin G, complement
components C1R, C1S and C2, complement factors B, D and
I, chymase, hepsin, medullasin and proteins of the blood
coagulation cascade including kallikrein, thrombin, and
Factors VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa and XIIa. Members of the
chymotrypsin superfamily have amino acid and structural
homology of the catalytic domains, although a comparison
of the sequences of the catalytic domains reveals the
presence of insertions or deletions of amino acids. However, these insertions and deletions map to the
surface of the folded molecule and thus do not affect the
basic structure although it is likely that they
contribute to the specificity of interactions of the
molecule with substrates and inhibitors (Strassburger, W.
et al, FEBS Lett., 157, 219-223 (1983)).Serine protease inhibitors are also well known and are
divided into the following families: the bovine
pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) family, the Kazal
family, the alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) family, the
Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI) family, the
serpin family, the Kunitz family, the four-disulphide
core family, the potato inhibitor family and the Bowman-Birk
family.Serine protease inhibitors inhibit their cognate serine
proteases and form stable 1:1 complexes with these
proteases. Structural data are available for several
protease-inhibitor complexes
