<ABSTRACT>
The heat absorbing member formed by connecting to the 
bottom portion of the inlet header (1) with that of the 

outlet header (2) through the heat absorbing tube is installed 
so that the heat absorbing tube is located in the 

heating container (9), the heat absorbing tube (16) is 
comprised of a plurality of the down tubes (3, 4) and down 

tubes (5, 6) all with lower ends closed and connected under 
the inlet header (1) and outlet header (2) respectively, and 

the spiral tubes (7, 8) which connect to the top with the 
bottom portion of the down tubes (3, 4) and down tubes (5, 

6), and the spiral tubes (7, 8) are the same length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for heat
exchange between liquids, gas and liquid, and gases, and
more particularly, between liquids, see for example DE-A-1932027.As the conventional heat exchanging apparatus has often
been used as such between the heating medium, which is
either a high temperature liquid or gas, and the liquid as
shown in Fig. 3, this is used as an example for description.
In this apparatus, a heat absorbing member 30 comprising of
a heat absorbing tube 31 connecting a bottom portion of an
inlet header 1 with that of an outlet header 2, with the
heat absorbing tube 31 below the outlet header 2 being of a
spiral form, is installed while locating the heat absorbing
tube 31 inside the heating container 9. The heating container
9 is provided with a heating medium inlet 11 and
outlet 12, respectively for supply and discharge of the
heating medium.In heating the liquid by the above type of heat exchanging
apparatus while the liquid is supplied from the
inlet header 1 into the heat absorbing tube 31, the heating
medium is supplied through the heating medium inlet 11 into
the heating container 9. The hot water obtained through
heat exchange between the heating medium and the liquid in 
the heat absorbing tube 31 is supplied through the outlet
header 2 to the load unit (not shown). On the other hand,
the heating medium is discharged through the heating medium
outlet 12. If this heat exchanging apparatus is used to
supply hot water to a plurality of load units, such as three
load units including heater 13, a hot water supply unit 14,
and a bathtub 15, as shown in Fig. 4, three heat absorbing
members 30A, 30B, and 30C must be installed in the heating
container 9 in correspondence to these loads. To supply the
hot water to the load, the inlet header 1A and outlet header
2A of the heat absorbing member 30A are connected to the
heater 13 through a pipeline 17, in which a pump 18' is
incorporated, while the water supply source 18 connected to
the inlet header 1A of the heat absorbing member 30, the
outlet header 2B is connected to the hot water supply unit
14 and the inlet header 1C and outlet header 2C of the heat
absorbing member 30C connected to the bathtub 15 through the
pipeline 21, in which the pump 20 is incorporated.The heat exchanging apparatus of the above type has
only one heat absorbing tube 31 on one heat absorbing member
30, resulting in poor heat exchange efficiency between the
liquid in the heat absorbing tube 31 and the heating medium
in the heating container 9.
