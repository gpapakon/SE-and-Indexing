<ABSTRACT>
A safety device for passenger conveyors, in particular for escalators and moving pavements, is proposed, having at least one support plate (1) which contains comb segments (3) and is displaceable essentially horizontally relative to at least one support element (6) accommodating it and is pivotable about a horizontal rotation axis (20) outside the comb segments (3) and also interacts with at least one cut-off device (26) stopping the drive of the passenger conveyor.

<CLAIMS>
Safety device for passenger conveyors, especially 
for escalators and moving pavements, having at least one 

support plate (1) containing comb segments (3), characterized 
in that the support plate (1) is arranged to be displaceable 

substantially horizontally relative to at least 
one support element (6) accommodating it, and to be pivotable 

about a horizontal axis of rotation (20) outside the 
comb segments (3), and also co-operates with at least one 

shut-off device (26) which brings the drive of the passenger 
conveyor to a standstill. 
Safety device according to Claim 1, characterized 
by a support element (6), provided laterally in each case 

beneath the support plate (1), which support element is 
equipped with means (7, 8) for displacing the support plate 

(1). 
Safety device according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the support elements (6) are in the form 

of roller supports. 
Safety device according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
by at least two rollers (7, 8), each provided in 

the region of a respective roller support (6). 
Safety device according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the axis of rotation (20) of the support 

plate (1) is provided in its free end region (25) remote 
from the comb segments (3). 
Safety device according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the comb segments (3) are each arranged to 

be pivotable about a fulcrum (22) with respect to the end 
region (2), accommodating them, of the support plate (1). 
Safety device according to Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the fulcrum (22) is formed by a round-headed 

screw (21). 
Safety device according to Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
by at least one pressure wave hose (18), which  

 
extends substantially over the entire width of the comb 

segments (3) between the latter and the end region (2), 
accommodating them, of the support plate (1), and which, on 

actuation, produces the shutting-off of the drive of the 
passenger conveyor. 
Safety device according to Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the pressure wave hose (18), seen in the 

transport direction, is provided behind the fulcrums (21) 
of the comb segments (3). 
Safety device according to Claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the shut-off device (26) is provided at 

least at one side between the support plate (1) and the 
roller support (6), substantially between the rollers (7, 

8) of the roller support (6). 
Safety device according to Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that between the rollers (7, 8), mounted 

so as to slide or roll, a lever (11) is mounted on the 
support plate (1) or components (10) of the latter, the 

free end (12) of which lever is connected to a switch rod 
(13) which is guided and biased on the corresponding roller 

support (6) and which actuates an end switch (16) when the 
bias force is exceeded.
