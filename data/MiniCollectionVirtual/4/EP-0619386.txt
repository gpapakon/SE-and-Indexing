<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a solution for the electrolytic deposition of palladium or palladium alloys, which preferably contains palladium sulphate and/or sulphamate and at least one complexing agent for palladium ions as well as, in addition, at least one heterocyclic compound. The heterocyclic compounds used can be 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)-pyrazine, 2,2'-biquinolyl, 2,4'-bipyridyl, 1,10-phenanthroline and/or 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-biquinolyl. The invention further relates to a method for the electrolytic coating (electrodeposition, electroplating) of electrically conductive substrate surfaces with such solutions.

Solution for the electrolytic deposition of palladium or palladium
alloys, preferably containing palladium sulphate and/or sulphamate and at

least one complexing agent for palladium ions, wherein at least one
heterocyclic compound, selected from the group 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)-pyrazine,

2,2'-bichinolyl, 2,4'-bipyridyl, 1,10-phenanthroline and 4,4'-dicarboxyl-2,2'-bichinolyl,
is additionally contained in the solution.
Solution according to claim 1, characterised in that 2,2'-bipyridyl
and/or 4,4'-bipyridyl are additionally contained in the solution.
Solution according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the heterocyclic compounds are each contained in concentrations of

from 3 to 80 mg/l solution.
Solution according to one of the preceding claims, characterised by
a pH value from 5 to 13.5.
Solution according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the solution contains salts of phosphoric acid, amidosulphunc acid,

ammonia and/or ammonium salts as the complexing agent.
Method for the electrolytic coating of electrically conductive
substrate surfaces with palladium or palladium alloys, having the method

steps: 

a. bringing into contact the substrate surfaces and at least one
preferably platinum-plated, electrically conductive electrode surface with a

solution having a pH value from 5 to 13.5, preferably having a pH
value greater than or equal to 8, containing at least one palladium

compound, preferably palladium sulphate and/or palladium sulphamate, at
least one complexing agent for palladium ions and at least one heterocyclic

compound, selected from the group 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)-pyrazine, 2,2'-bichinolyl,
1,10-phenanthroline, 4,4'-dicarboxyl-2,2'-bichinolyl, 2,4'-bipyridyl,

and
b. producing a flow of current between the substrate surfaces and the
electrode surfaces, the substrate surfaces being polarised as the cathode,

and the electrode surfaces being polarised as the anode.
