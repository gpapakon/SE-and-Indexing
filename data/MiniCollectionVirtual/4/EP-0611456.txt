<DESCRIPTION>
 Twisted Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal ModulatorSPECIFICATIONField of the Invention The invention relates generally to liquid-crystal devices. In particular. the invention relates to a light modulator made from a ferroelectric liquid crystal.Background ArtElectro-optic modulators using nematic liquid crystals are extensively used as displays, spatial light modulators, and other specialized optical elements.Most of these use a twisted nematic liquid crystal which is aligned at opposite sides of the cell in perpendicular planar directions. The average direction in which the long axes of the liquid-crystal molecules point is called the director. Thus, the directors at the two inner surfaces of the cell are parallel to the surfaces but perpendicular to each other. In between the two sides, absent other effects, the director slowly twists through 90°. The liquid crystal is birefringent; that is, it has a refractive index difference An between the directions parallel and perpendicular to the director. If 

 where d is the thickness of the cell and λ is the wavelength of light, then the linear polarization of light traversing the cell follows the twist; that is, the twisted nematic waveguides the light. In the usual configuration, sheet polarizers are placed on both sides of the cell in correspondence with the alignment direction, that is, in perpendicular orientations. Thus, the undistorted. slowly twisted nematic liquid- crystal waveguides the light and therefore rotates the linear polarization of the light so whatever passes through the first polarizer also passes through the second polarizer. However, if a voltage is applied across the cell, the liquid-crystal molecules are reoriented due to a dielectric torque, and the molecules become aligned with the field, thus destroying the slow twist which produced the waveguiding.On the other hand, several classes of ferroelectric liquid-crystal devices have been proposed. See, for example, the review articles by Patel ei ai.. "Ferroelectric liquid crystal devices," Proceedings of SPIE. volume 613. 19S6. pp. 130-134 and "Properties and applications of ferroelectric liquid crystals". Optical Engineering, voiume 26. 1987, pp. 373-384. A ferroelectric liquid crystal is one in which the liquid-crystal molecule is chiral and forms smectic layers. In such a system, a polarization develops having a vector direction within the plane of the layer and perpendicular to the director. See Patel, "Eiectro-optics of ferroelectric 

 liquid crystals," Proceedings of SPIE, volume
