<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for holding in place on a tube, during a welding operation and during the consecutive cooling period, a heat-weldable connector which has the shape of half a cylinder and which contains at least one heating element for the purpose of welding on to the tube by a thermal method. This device is characterised in that it comprises a strap (9) which is made of a flexible substance and which is provided at each of its ends with a fastening means (10, 11) making it possible to fix it removably to the said heat-weldable connector (2) by passing around the said tube (3), at least one of the said fastening means including means for altering the distance between the said heat-weldable connector (2) and the corresponding end of the said strap (9). Application to tappings on mains intended for conveying fluid.

<CLAIMS>
Device especially for holding a heat-weldable
fitting (2) in place on a pipe during a welding

operation and during the cooling which follows, this
fitting comprising a strap (9) which is made of a

flexible material and which is provided at each of its
ends with a fastening means (10, 11), one of which

consists of a fastener (11) made in two parts joined
together by connecting members, one of these parts

being a cross-piece (14) integral with the
corresponding end of the said strap (9), characterized

in that the other part consists of a fastening cross-piece
(15) and in that the connecting members consist

of bolts (16) which pass through the facing ends of the
two cross-pieces (14, 15).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the position in which the said bolts (16) are

screwed tight corresponds substantially to the optimum
clamping pressure of the device.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that at least one of the said fastening means (10, 11)

includes at least one positioning stud (10c, 11c)
engaging with a conjugate housing which is made in the

corresponding fastening lug (12, 13).
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that at least one of the said

fastening means comprises a loop (10) which has a
central opening (10a) of approximately rectangular 

shape and to which the corresponding end of the said
strap (9) is firmly attached.
