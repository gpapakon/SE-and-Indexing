<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic transducer and suspension assembly suitable for use in 
both contact recording and in winchester-type applications is described. 

A generally rectangular elongated flat suspension member includes a 
vertical-type inductive read/write transducer formed integrally with the 

suspension member and is embedded in one end of the suspension member. 
The vertical inductive transducer is suitable for vertical recording 

applications. The transducer vertical magnetic pole tip and magnetic 
yoke structure are formed at one end of the suspension member with the 

vertical pole tip extending to and exposed at an air bearing surface 
formed on the lower surface of a slider-shaped protrusion extending from 

the lower surface of the end of the suspension member. The integral 
transducer/suspension assembly can be adapted for either flying above the 

recording media or for use in continuous contact with the recording 
media. The air bearing surface is formed on the lower surface of a wear 

pad. The fabrication of the transducer/suspension assembly is adapted to 
be performed at the wafer level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transducer-suspension assembly
for a magentic storage device.Moving magnetic storage devices, especially magnetic disk drives,
are the memory device of choice. This is due to their expanded non-volatile
memory storage capability together with a relatively low cost.
Accurate retrieval of the stored information from these devices becomes
critical, requiring the magnetic transducer to be positioned as close to
the storage media as possible. Optimally, the transducer may actually
contact the media.Magnetic disk drives are information storage devices which utilize
at least one rotatable magnetic media disk having concentric data tracks
defined for storing data, a read/write transducer for reading the data
from or writing the data to the various data tracks, a support means,
generally referred to as a slider, for supporting the transducer adjacent
the data tracks typically in a flying mode above the storage media, a
suspension assembly for resiliently supporting the slider and the
transducer over the data tracks, and a positioning actuator coupled to
the transducer/slider/suspension combination for moving the transducer
across the media to the desired data track and maintaining the transducer
over the data track center line during a read or a write operation. The
transducer is attached to or is formed integrally with the slider which
supports the transducer above the data surface of the storage disk by a
cushion of air, referred to as an air bearing, generated by the rotating
disk. Alternatively, the transducer may operate in contact with the
surface of the disk. The suspension provides desired slider loading and
dimensional stability between the slider and an actuator arm which
couples the transducer/slider/suspension assembly to the actuator. The
suspension is required to maintain the transducer and the slider adjacent
the data surface of the disk with as low a loading force as possible.
The actuator positions the transducer over the correct track according to
the data desired on a read operation or to the correct track for
placement of the data during a write operation. The actuator is
controlled to position the transducer over the desired data track by
shifting the combination assembly across the surface of the disk in a
direction generally transverse to the data tracks. In conventional disk drives, the transducer and the slider are
formed separately and then attached to the suspension in a manual,
operator controlled precision operation. Typically, these components are
