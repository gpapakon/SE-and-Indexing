<ABSTRACT>
A climbing console (3) which can be suspended on a wall (1) exhibits a frame (4) and a hook (5) which is mounted displaceably in the frame (4) and can be fixed in a wall recess (2). The hook (5) can be braced and/or released with the transverse wedge (6) which can be displaced parallel to the wall (1). A carriage (8) mounted displaceably on the frame (4, 4c) can be fixed by means of an arresting wedge (9) which can move in the displacement direction. The arresting wedge (9) can be clamped with respect to a transverse wedge (10) which is provided on the carriage and can be displaced parallel to the wall (1).

Cradle (3) which can be suspended on a 
wall (1) with a frame (4) and a hook (5) which can 

be secured in a wall recess (2), characterised in 
that the hook (5) is mounted displaceably in a 

profiled pipe of the frame (4) and can be clamped 
or unclamped by means of a transverse wedge (6) 

which is displaceable parallel to the wall (1). 
Cradle according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the hook (5) comprises, on its underside, 

a recess (15), into which a projection (2) which 
is formed in the wall recess (2) can project, such 

that the hook (5) can be pressed against the 
abovementioned projection (20) when the cradle (3) 

is secured. 
Cradle according to either one of Claims 1 
or 2, characterised in that the frame (4) 

comprises a profiled pipe which, when the cradle 
(3) is mounted, abuts on the wall below the wall 

recess (2) for the purpose of supporting the 
cradle. 
Cradle according to any one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the frame (4), and the  

 
hook (5) which can be moved therein, comprise 

slot-shaped apertures (13a, 13b, 14), which are 
flush with one another and in which the transverse 

wedge (6) is displaceably mounted. 
Cradle according to any one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that a spring (7) is 

accommodated in the frame (4), which spring 
presses the hook (5) out of the frame (4) into the 

unclamped position. 
Cradle according to any one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that a displaceable carriage 

(8) is mounted on one of the sides (4c) of the 
angular frame (4), which carriage may be secured 

in the displacement direction by means of a 
moveable stop wedge (9). 
Cradle according to Claim 6, characterised 
in that the stop wedge (9) can be clamped against 

a transverse wedge (10) which is provided on the 
carriage and parallel to the wall (1). 
Cradle according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that the stop wedge (9) comprises a nose (16) 

in the vicinity of its wedge tip, such that it is 
retained in an non-detachable manner between the 

carriage (8) and the frame (4c).  
 
Cradle according to any one of Claims 1 to 
8, characterised in that the transverse wedge (6; 

10) is retained, in each case, with the aid of 
projecting elements (21). 
Cradle according to any one of Claims 1 to 
9, characterised in that the frame (4) is 

triangular (4a, 4b, 4c), wherein one side (4a) is 
intended to abut on the wall (1) and a second side 

(4c), which is at right angles to the first side, 
is intended to project in a perpendicular manner 

from the wall (1). 
Cradle according to CLaim 10, 
characterised in that a plug connection (11) for 

an upright (12) is provided on the end of the 
second side (4c).
