<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus and method of the present invention provide even and repeatable 
heat transfer to and from essentially the entire substrate used in semiconductor 

processing. In particular, the support platform upon which the substrate sets during 
processing is designed to permit heat transfer to the very edge of the substrate so that 

substrate space unavailable for processing is minimized. 
 
The support platform comprises a substrate-facing surface 211 including at least 
one fluid supply source 214; a continuous, platform-based fluid flow barrier 212; and 

at least one opening 234 through substrate-facing surface 211 through which a 
substrate lift finger 221 can be operated. Fluid flow barrier 212 contacts the back 

side (non-processed side) of the substrate at a location very near the exterior edge of 
the substrate. 
 
To prevent heat transfer fluid from flowing downward through the lift finger 
openings 234, a lift finger sealing cover 222 is employed. Sealing cover 222 is 

preferably self-aligning, to ensure formation of a continuous lift finger fluid flow 
barrier 228 surrounding lift finger opening 234.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to an apparatus and method which ensure
substantially even and repeatable heat transfer to and from the entire substrate used
in semiconductor processing. In particular, the platform upon which the substrate sits
during processing is designed to permit heat transfer to the very edge of the substrate
so that minimal substrate surface space is unavailable for processing.In the manufacture of many electronic or electrical components such as
integrated circuits, there is a need to deposit thin films on substrates. Materials such
as, for example, aluminum, titanium, tungsten, tantalum, tantalum nitride, cobalt, and
silica may be deposited on ceramic, glass or silicon-derived substrates using physical
vapor deposition (PVD) processes such as a sputtering process. Another method of
deposition of solid materials upon a substrate is chemical vapor deposition (CVD),
wherein a solid material is deposited from a gaseous phase onto a substrate by means
of a chemical reaction. The deposition reaction involved is generally thermal
decomposition, chemical oxidation, or chemical reduction. The CVD process can be
used to deposit many elements and alloys as well as compounds including oxides,
nitrides and carbides.The thin film deposited is subsequently etched or otherwise fabricated into the
circuits and/or components.In a typical PVD process, such as sputtering, a low pressure atmosphere of an
ionizable gas such as argon or helium is produced in a vacuum chamber. The
pressure in the vacuum chamber is reduced to about 10-6 to 10-10 Torr (1 Torr = 133 Pa), after which
argon, for example, is introduced to produce an argon partial pressure ranging
between about 0.0001 Torr (0.1 mTorr) and about 0.020 Torr (20 mTorr). Two
electrodes, a cathode and an anode, are generally disposed in the vacuum chamber. 
The cathode is typically made of the material to be deposited or sputtered, and the
anode is generally formed by the enclosure (particular walls of the vacuum chamber,
or the platform upon which the substrate sits, for example). At times, an auxiliary
anode may be used or the article to be coated may serve as the anode. Typically a
high voltage is applied between these two electrodes, and the substrate to be coated
is disposed upon a platform positioned opposite the cathode. The platform upon
which the substrate sits is often heated and/or cooled, and heat is transferred between
the platform and the substrate, to assist in obtaining the desired coating upon the
substrate. The coating is a thin
