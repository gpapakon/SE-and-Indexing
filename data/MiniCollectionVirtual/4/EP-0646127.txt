<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with Government support, awarded by the N.C.I.
(NIH). The U.S. Government has certain rights in this application.The present invention is directed to novel peptides which influence the
growth of cancerous tumors in humans. More specifically, the present invention
relates to bombesin antagonists which are ψ8-9 pseudopeptides containing a Tac,
MTac, or DMTac residue at the C terminal position, the salts thereof, and
pharmaceutical compositions, methods of synthesizing these peptides and
methods of use pertaining to these peptides. These peptides possess antagonist
properties against bombesin or bombesin-like peptides.This invention relates to polypeptide compounds which possess antagonist
properties against bombesin or bombesin-like peptides (such as gastrin releasing
peptide (GRP), Neuromedin C and the like) hereinafter referred to as bombesin
antagonist properties and which are of value, for example in a composition destined for the treatment of
malignant diseases in warm-blooded organisms such as man. The invention
includes novel polypeptide compounds and processes for their manufacture; novel
pharmaceutical compositions containing said polypeptide compounds and
processes for the manufacture of medicaments containing them for use in
producing a bombesin antagonist effect in warm-blooded organisms such as man.Bombesin is a tetradecapeptide amide which was first isolated from the
skin of the frog Bombinabombina (Anastasi, Erspamer and Bucci, Experientia,
1971, 27, 166). It is known that bombesin is a potent mitogen for mouse Swiss
3T3 fibroblast cells (Rozengurt and Sinnett-Smith, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,
1983, 80, 2936) and that it stimulates amylase secretion from guinea pig
pancreatic acini (Jensen, Jones, Folkers and Gardner, Nature, 1984, 309, 61).
It is also known that bombesin-like peptides are produced and secreted by human
small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells (Moody, Pert, Gazdar, Carney and Minna, Science, 1981, 214, 1246), that exogenously added bombesin-like peptides can
stimulate the growth of human SCLC cells invitro (Carney, Cuttita, Moody and
Minna, CancerResearch, 1987, 47, 821) and that a monoclonal antibody specific
for the C-Terminus region of bombesin and GRP can block binding of GRP to its
receptors and prevent the growth of human SCLC cells both invitro and invivo
(Cuttita, Carney, Mulshine, Moody, Fedorko, Fischler and Minna, Nature, 1985,
316, 823).GRP which has bombesin-like properties is a widely distributed peptide
amide containing 27 amino acids
