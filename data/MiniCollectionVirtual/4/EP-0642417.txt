<ABSTRACT>
An impact-resisting glazing structure is provided which is comprised of support frame (12) and a multilayered laminate secured in the support frame, the laminate being comprised of a sheet of glass (14), a polyester film (16) and a sheet of adhesive film (18) sandwiched therebetween, the polyester film being preferentially asymmetrically oriented to provide dominant mechanical properties in the transverse direction. Insulated glass structures are included.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to glazing structures which substantially resist 
penetration by objects propelled by humans or other means. In particular, the 
structures resist penetration by storm driven objects and objects commonly used 
in burglaries to gain entry, such as bricks, rocks, sticks, baseball bats and tire 
irons. Various types of glazing structures have been developed which resist 
penetration by objects which are propelled against a surface of the structure. 
Glass laminations, commonly referred to as safety glass, consisting of a plurality 
of glass sheets and interlayers have been made. These structures are generally 
thick, heavy constructions which are not adaptable for use in usual framing 
applications and are expensive to fabricate. In addition, plastic sheeting, such as 
polycarbonate sheeting has been used. However, such sheeting is relatively 
costly and has limited chemical and weathering resistance. Other glass/plastic 
laminates are known, including insulated glazing structures. These structures 
suffer from the same deficiencies as noted above. Also, the insulated structures 
tend to fog due to condensation of moisture which enters the gas space between 
the glass panes. What is needed is a light weight impact resisting structure which 
is adaptable for use in usual framing applications which avoids the problems 
noted. US-A-4072779 discloses asymmetrically stretched polyester films and the 
lamination of such films to a glass sheet to manufacture an automobile 
windscreen. This reference is not concerned with producing a glazing structure 
having improved impact resistance, and its stated object is to produce a laminated 
windscreen which has improved optical properties and which is also frangible. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided an 
insulated impact-resisting glazing structure comprising two sheets of glass spaced 
apart by an interior spacer positioned along the periphery of said sheets of glass 
providing a gas space therebetween, one sheet of glass having on its interior 
surface a polyester film adhered to said surface by a sheet of adhesive film, said 
structure having a seating member positioned around its periphery to maintain an 
air-tight space between said sheets of glass, said polyester film being 
asymmetrically oriented to provide dominant physical properties in its transverse 
direction.  
 According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided an 
insulated impact-resisting glazing structure having improved moisture

<CLAIMS>
An insulated impact-resisting glazing structure comprising two 
sheets of glass (32)(34) spaced apart by an interior spacer (42) positioned along 

the periphery of said sheets of glass providing a gas space (40) therebetween, one 
sheet of glass (32) having on its interior surface a polyester film (36) adhered to 

said surface by a sheet of adhesive film (38), said structure having a sealing 
member (48) positioned around its periphery to maintain an air-tight space 

between said sheets of glass, said polyester film being asymmetrically oriented to 
provide dominant physical properties in its transverse direction. 
An insulated impact-resisting glazing structure having improved 
moisture resistance comprising a support frame (50) and a multilayered composite 

secured in said support frame, said composite comprising two sheets of glass 
(52)(54) spaced apart by an interior spacer (60) positioned along the periphery of 

the sheets of glass to provide a gas space (66) therebetween, one of said sheets of 
glass (54) having on its interior surface a polyester film (56) adhered to said 

surface by a sheet of adhesive film (58), said composite having a sealing member 
(68) positioned around its periphery to maintain an air-tight space between said 

sheets of glass, said polyester film and said adhesive film approaching but spaced 
from said spacer, said polyester film being asymmetrically oriented to provide 

dominant physical properties in its transverse direction.

wherein crystalline and amorphous regions of said polyester film are oriented 

preferentially in the transverse direction. 
A glazing structure according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein said adhesive film has a thickness of 0.25 to 1.52 mm.  

 
A glazing structure according to any one of the preceding claims 
wherein the sheet of glass laminated to the polyester film has a thickness of 2 to 

12 mm.
