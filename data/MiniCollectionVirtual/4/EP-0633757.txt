<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a wound dressing. According to the invention, the upper surface of a perforated carrier material (2) is coated with a curable silicone mixture (3) and cold air is blown onto the underside of the coated carrier material. Heat is then applied to the silicone mixture until it has cured to a silicone gel. The invention also relates to an arrangement for carrying out the method, and also to a wound dressing manufactured in accordance with the method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and to an arrangement 
of apparatus for manufacturing wound dressings of the kind 
which comprise a perforated carrier material and a layer of 
hydrophobic silicone gel which lies against the wound, or sore, 
when the dressing is worn. The invention also relates to a 
wound dressing manufactured in accordance with the inventive 
method. A wound dressing of this kind is known from our 
EP-A-0 261 167, in which the carrier material is fully enclosed 
by the silicone gel although while leaving openings through the 
dressing. When manufacturing a dressing of this kind, the 
carrier material is dipped into a mixture of those components 
which, when cured, form the hydrophobic silicone gel, and the 
carrier material is then transferred to a curing oven in which 
the carrier material is cured. In order to ensure that the 
silicone gel is uniformly distributed on both sides of the 
carrier material and that the perforations do not become 
clogged with gel, the carrier material is guided in the oven in 
a relatively complicated path. This known method is not 
suited to high production rates. Another wound dressing of the 
abovementioned kind is known from EP-A-251 810 which document 
discloses the features of the preamble of Claims 1, 4 and 6. The object of the present invention is to provide a method 
which will enable such wound dressings to be manufactured at a 
high production rate and in a simple and reliable manner. The invention also relates to apparatus for carrying out the 
method to a wound dressing suitable for manufacture by means of 
the inventive method. To this end, a method of manufacturing wound dressings including 
the step of applying a coating of curable silicone 
mixture to the upper surface of a perforated carrier material and 
then applying heat to the silicone mixture until it has cured  
 
is characterized by blowing cold air onto the underside of 
the coated carrier material so that the silicone mixture is 
blown away from the perforations in the carrier material so as 
to form through penetrating perforations and prevent clogging 
of the perforations in the carrier material before the 
applying of heat. At the same 
time, the cold air flow ensures that the silicone mixture will 
not begin to cure before it has time to spread over the carrier 
material. The flow of air through the carrier material will, of 
course, also prevent the silicone mixture from running through 
the perforations in said material. An arrangement for carrying out the

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing wound dressings including the step 
of applying a coating of curable silicone mixture (3) to the 

upper surface of a perforated carrier material (2) and then 
applying heat to the silicone mixture until it has cured, 
characterized
 
by blowing cold air onto the underside of the coated 

carrier material so that the silicone mixture is blown away 
from the perforations in the carrier material so as to form 

through penetrating perforations and prevent clogging of the 
perforations in the carrier material before the applying of heat. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 by 
blowing hot air onto the underside of the coated carrier 

material (2) after blowing cold air thereonto until the silicone 
mixture (3) has cured. 
A method according to claim 2, 
characterized
 by 
interrupting the delivery of hot air onto the underside of said 

coated carrier material before the silicone mixture (3) has 
completely cured; and terminating the curing process in an 

oven. 
An arrangement for manufacturing a wound dressing which 
comprises a perforated carrier material (2) and a layer of 

hydrophobic silicone gel (3), which arrangement includes means 
(1) for coating the upper surface of the carrier material with 

a mixture of components which when cured by means (5) for 
delivering heat to the component mixture applied to the upper 

surface of the carrier material form a silicone gel, 

characterized
 in that the arrangement includes an 
air-blowing unit (4) which functions to blow cold air onto the 

underside of the carrier material so that the silicone mixture 
is blown away from the perforations in the carrier material so 

as to form through penetrating perforations and prevent clogging 
of the perforations in the carrier material and which is 

placed opposite the coating means (1). 
An arrangement according to claim 4, 
characterized
  
 

in that the hot-air delivery means has the form of a hot-air 
blowing unit (5). 
A wound dressing comprising a perforated carrier material 
(2) and a layer of hydrophobic silicone gel (3) which lies 

against the wound surface when the dressing is worn, 
characterized
 
in that the carrier material is impervious 

to air and fluid, or only slightly permeable to air and fluid 
in the parts thereof lying between the perforations; and in 

that the carrier material is coated with silicone gel on only 
one side thereof. 
A wound dressing according to claim 6, 
characterized
 
in that the carrier material (2) is comprised of a 

relatively soft plastic film. 
A wound dressing according to claim 7, 
characterized
 
in that the plastic film is microporous. 
A wound dressing according to claim 6, 7 or 8, 
characterized
 
in that the carrier material (2) is coated with 

a silicone primer. 
A wound dressing according to any one of claims 7-9, 

characterized
 in that the carrier material is 
comprised of a two-ply material, including a plastic layer and 

a layer of fibre material.
