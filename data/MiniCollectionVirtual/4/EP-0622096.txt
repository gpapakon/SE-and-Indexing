<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a gliding (sliding) board, in particular a snowboard, which is intended to support both boots of a skier. The board comprises a base structure (4), at least the front end of which is raised to form the tip. It also has a central zone (12) with two zones (15), (16) for mounting the bindings, a front zone (13) and a rear zone (14). It is characterised in that it has, at least in one of the front or rear zones (13), (14), a longitudinal reinforcement (20) which is profiled along the length and the width of the said zone. The reinforcement extends from the vicinity of the end of the front or rear zone (13), (14) up to at least the vicinity of the mounting zone (16), (15) located close to the zone.

Snowboard adapted to support both boots of a surfer 
that are retained next to one another on the board by binding 

elements (2, 3), comprising a lengthy base structure (4, 54), 
in the form of a plate, of which at least the front end (4a) 

is turned up to form the shovel, the base structure comprising 
a central zone (12) with two mounting zones (15, 16, 65, 66) 

for the binding elements, the binding mounting zones being 
offset with respect to one another along a median longitudinal 

direction (5) defined by the base structure, the base 
structure further comprising a front zone (13) located in 

front of the central zone, and a rear zone (14) located behind 
the central zone, characterized by the fact that it has, at 

least in one of the front or rear zones (13, 14), a lengthy 
reinforcement (20, 25, 32, 36, 40, 44, 51, 56) sectioned 

along the length and width of the said zone, that extends from 
at least the vicinity of the end (4a, 4b) of the base 

structure, up to at least the vicinity of the mounting zone 
(16, 15, 65, 66) for the binding element located on the side 

of said front or rear zone so as to increase the torsional 
and/or flexural strength of a surface of the base structure 

covering said front or rear zone (13, 14) and a portion at 
least of said mounting zone (16, 15, 65, 66), and that the 

central zone (12), between the mounting zones (16, 15, 65, 
66) for the binding elements, the stiffness of the 

reinforcement is locally lower. 
Snowboard according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the stiffness of the reinforcement decreases 

generally from the mounting zone (16, 15, 65, 66) toward the 
front or rear zone (13, 14). 
Snowboard according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the reinforcement (25, 40, 44, 51) extends in said  

 
front or rear zone along two arms (28, 29, 30, 31) located 

along the lateral edges (6, 7) of the base structure, from the 
end of said front or rear zone (13, 14) toward the two lateral 

edges of the mounting zone (16, 15). 
Snowboard according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the reinforcement (20, 36) extends in said front or 

rear zone (13, 14) along two arms (21, 22, 23, 24) converging 
from each corner of the base structure (4) toward said front 

or rear mounting zone (16, 15) along the median longitudinal 
direction (5). 
Snowboard according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the reinforcement (32) extends in said front or rear 

zone (13, 14) along an arm (33, 34) located along the median 
longitudinal direction (5) defined by the base structure (4). 
Snowboard according any of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the reinforcement (36, 44) 

extends in the front zone and in the rear zone (13, 14), and 
that it has a discontinuity between the mounting zones (16, 

15). 
Snowboard according to claims 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized by the fact that the reinforcement (40, 44, 51, 

56) extends continuously in the front zone (13), the central 
zone (12), and the rear zone (14), and that it has a 

discontinuity along the median longitudinal direction (5) 
defined by the base structure (4, 54). 
Snowboard, according to claim 1, 3 or 4, 
characterized by the fact that the two arms (21, 22, 23, 24, 

28, 29, 30, 31) are connected in a continuous manner by a 
bridging connection (26, 27) that has a common surface with 

the binding mounting zone (16, 15). 
Snowboard according to any of claims 2-8, 
characterized by the fact that the arm(s) have a locally 

variable stiffness along their length.
