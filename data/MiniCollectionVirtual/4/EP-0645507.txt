<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a scaffolding platform (1) which is used in the scaffolding as a tread surface and is distinguished, with respect to known scaffolding platforms, by a much smaller transporting volume and by simplicity and solidity. The essence of the invention consists in that, in the case of the novel scaffolding platform, any frame reinforcement and separate suspension or fastening elements or suspension claws fastened on the frame are dispensed with. The scaffolding platform (1) comprises a stable and weather-resistant panel in unit dimensions predetermined by the geometry of the crossmember bearing plane and is mounted directly - without the interposition of further structural elements - on the crossmembers or supporting elements (2, 3) of the respective scaffolding plane. In order to permit the frame-like direct mounting on the crossmembers (2, 3), the corners (5) of the scaffolding-platform panel have clearances in them in accordance with the space requirements of the scaffolding uprights (4) passing through vertically in the corner regions. Consequently, during assembly of the scaffolding, after laying the scaffolding platform on the crossmembers or supporting elements, the desired installation position is produced immediately and without complications, and the scaffolding platform is secured against impermissible horizontal displacement out of the installation position.
