<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a microscope (1) with a mirror housing (3) which can be fitted on the microscope stand (2) for coupling lamp housings (4) via at least four adapters (10). The mirror housing (3) has an adjustable deflection mirror (5) for changing over as desired between the adapted lamp housings (4) and is fitted inside with a separate chamber (11) for the current/voltage supply (6) of the lamp housings (4). The mirror housing (3) in the form of a one-piece component is secured to the rear surface (8) of the microscope stand (2) via heat insulators (9).

Microscope (1) with a mirror housing (3), which is mountable at the 
microscope stand (2), with adaptors for the coupling-on of separate lamp 

housings (4), wherein the mirror housing (3) comprises switchable mirror 
means (5) for the selectable switching-over between the adapted lamp 

housings (4) and is provided with a current supply equipment (6) for the 
light sources (7) of the lamp housings (4), characterised thereby, that 

the mirror housing (3) is arranged as integral constructional element at 
the rear surface (8) of the microscope stand (2) by way of thermal 

insulations (9) and comprises switching means for the selectable 
utilisation of the incident or transmitted light illumination of the 

microscope (1) and at least four adaptors (10) are provided for the 
coupling-on of the lamp housings (4) and a separate chamber (11) for the 

reception of the current or voltage supply unit (6) is formed 
additionally in the mirror housing (3). 
Microscope with a mirror housing, which is mountable at the 
microscope stand, according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that in 

the case of the coupling-on of a flash bulb (7), a motor (12) is provided 
for the automatic switching of a deflecting mirror (5) and the associated 

electronic control system (13) for the motor (12) is arranged in the 
separate chamber (11) of the current or voltage supply unit (6). 
Microscope with a mirror housing, which is mountable at the 
microscope stand, according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby, that 

for the dust-tight shutting-off of both the illumination ray paths (14) 
for the incident and transmitted light illumination, a respective lens 

(15) is provided in the microscope stand (2) at the connection places to 
the mirror housing (3).
