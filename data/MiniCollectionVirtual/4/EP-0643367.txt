<ABSTRACT>
Image processing method comprising the steps of:
 

generating a shifted image by shifting the original image 
by predetermined distance;

 
comparing corresponding pixels of said original image and 

said shifted image and counting the number of 
corresponding pixels which have the same density value, 

and,
 

changing said predetermined distance to other values and 
repeating for each value the comparing and counting step 

in order to calculate a discordance ratio for various 
distances.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processing method.A density cooccurrence matrix represents the relationship of
densities between two pixels in an image which
are remote from each other by predetermined distance. The
distance is usually defined as Î´(x,y) (coordinate
difference x in x direction and coordinate difference y in
y direction). Each element in the density cooccurrence matrix
represents the number of couples of certain densities. For example,
the value of the d1th column and d2th row
of the matrix represents the
number of couples of densities d1
and d2. matrix is proposed, in
which the summation of the number of couples of densities d1 and
d2 as well as the number of couples of densities of d2 and d1 is
stored in the same column and the same row.As far as the inventor knows, there has been disclosed no
concrete method for generating the density cooccurrence
matrix. If all couples of an image are compared in
density, N times comparation is necessary for an image of N
pixels. When the image size is 512x512, more than 260
thousand comparations are necessary. This means several
minutes of
computation time when using
a 16-bit personal computer for that purpose.Characteristic parameters, contrast, second moment
correlation etc. are usually calculated from the density
cooccurrence matrix. Cooccurrence matrices are known e.g from "On using cooccurrence matrices
to detect periodicities", A. R. FIGUEIRAS-VIDAL, IEEE ACOUSTICS, SPEECH
AND SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE, Vol ASSP-35, No. 1, January 1987.It is the object of the present invention to provide an image processing method for
generating a density co-occurrence matrix with a reduced computational effort.This object is solved by the image processing method of claim 1.In the following a preferred embodiment of the present invention is described referring to
the accompanying drawings.

changing said predetermined distance to other values and repeating for each
value the comparing and counting step in order to calculate a discordance ratio

for various distances.
