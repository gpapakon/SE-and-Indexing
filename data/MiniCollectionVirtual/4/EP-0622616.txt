<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for measuring the level of an interface (1) in a liquid (L) laden with particles in suspension. This apparatus includes a measuring bell (10) defining an internal volume (12), open to the bottom, in the liquid, an interface level sensor (C) known per se, suitable for taking interface level measurements in the said liquid across a measurement surface (14) emerging into the said internal volume (12) and means for moving the level of the liquid in the bell for the purpose of keeping the measurement surface outside the said liquid during periods when the sensor is not in use and in contact with the said liquid when the sensor is in use.

Apparatus for measuring the level of an interface (I) in a liquid 
(L) charged with particles in suspension, the apparatus being 

characterized in that it includes a measurement bell (10) defining an 
inside volume (12) that is downwardly open in the liquid, an 

interface level sensor (C) adapted to take measurements of the level 
of the interface in said liquid via a measurement surface (14) 

opening out into said inside volume (12) of the bell (10), and means 
for moving the level of the liquid in the bell (10) to maintain the 

measurement surface (14) out of said liquid during periods when the 
sensor (C) is not in use, and in contact with said liquid when the 

sensor (C) is in use. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that said means 
for displacing the level of the liquid comprise a source of gas under 

pressure (P) and a duct (15) for causing said source to communicate 
with said inside volume (12) of the bell. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said 
means for displacing the level of the liquid comprise a vacuum source 

(V) and a duct (25) for causing said source to communicate with said 
inside volume of the bell, and opening out therein above said 

measurement surface. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the apparatus includes a source (E) of liquid that is not 

charged with particles in suspension, and a duct (50) for causing 
said source to communicate with said inside volume (12) of the bell. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 2 to 4, characterized in 
that the measuring bell comprises a vertical tube (11) for partially 

immersing in said liquid, and a plug (13) placed in the tube and set 
back from the bottom end (30) thereof, said plug having on its bottom 

axial face both a central surface forming said measurement surface 
(14) and a chamfered edge (34) through which a duct opens out.  

 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that said duct 
opens out through the chamfered edge via a plurality of orifices (35, 

36) that are uniformly spaced apart, angularly. 
Apparatus according to claim 5 or 6, characterized in that said 
plug (13) has a housing (31) on its top axial face for receiving said 

sensor (C). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 5 to 7, characterized in 
that said plug is made of polycarbonate. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in 
that said measurement surface (14) is polished. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterized in 
that said sensor is selected from the following list: an ultrasound 

sensor, a camera. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterized 
in that it is used for measuring the level of the interface in a 

liquid charged with radioactive particles.
