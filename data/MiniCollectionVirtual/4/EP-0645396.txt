<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing 
dicyclopentyldichlorosilane and, more particularly, to a novel method 
in which cyclopentene and dichlorosilane are used to produce 
dicyclopentyldichlorosilane. Dicyclopentyldichlorosilane is widely used as basic starting 
material having high activity in the production of other organosilicon 
compounds or compounds containing organosilicon groups. Therefore, it has so far been attempted to produce the 
dicyclopentyldichlorosilane by the reaction between easily available 
starting materials, namely cyclopentene and dichlorosilane, and many 
studies on catalysts for this reaction have been done. However, all 
the catalysts which have so far been studied can hardly proceed the 
reaction, and so they cannot serve for the industrial use. Such being the case, the production of said compound has been 
carried out by another method which uses trichlorosilane and 
cyclopentene as starting materials. According to this method, 
trichlorosilane and cyclopentene undergo addition reaction in the 
presence of a platimum and/or rhodium catalyst to produce 
cyclopentyltrichlorosilane as an intermediate, and then the intermediate 
is made to react with cyclopentylmagnesium chloride to give the 
intended compound. However, this method has a disadvantage in 
requiring two different reactors since it comprises two different types 
of reactions, namely addition reaction and Grignard reaction. Thus, it is still a problem to be solved to produce useful 
dicyclopentyldichlorosilane by one-step addition reaction alone.  
 As a result of our intensive studies on simple methods for 
producing dicyclopentyldichlorosilane, it has been found out that 
dicyclopentyldichlorosilane of high purity can be produced with ease by 
one-step addition reaction when 1,3-diethinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisilo 
xane is used in combination with a platinum catalyst and/or a rhodium 
catalyst in order to cause a reaction between cyclopentene and 
dichlorosilane, thereby achieving the present invention. Therefore, a first object of the present invention is to provide a 
simple method of producing dicyclopentyldichlorosilane. A second object of the present invention is to provide a method of 
producing dicyclopentyldichlorosilane using easily available 
cyclopentene and dichlorosilane as starting materials. The above-described objects are attained by a method of producing 
dicyclopentyldichlorosilane wherein cyclopentene and dichlorosilane are 
reacted with each other using a platinum catalyst
