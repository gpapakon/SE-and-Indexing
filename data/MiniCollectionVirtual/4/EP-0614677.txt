<ABSTRACT>
Electrocatheter (head) for sequential cardiac stimulation (heart pacing), comprising one or more auricular electrodes and one or more ventricular electrodes which are intended to be connected to a double-chamber pacemaker using corresponding interface connectors, opportunely designed to allow its insertion into the coronary sinus so as to position the auricular electrodes in the coronary sinus in correspondence with the left auricle of the heart and the ventricular electrodes in the aorta at the start of the anterior interventricular in correspondence with the left ventricle, wherein the said ventricular electrodes (16) are arranged in proximity to the distal end of the catheter in order to allow stimulation and ventricular probing and the said auricular electrodes (14) are opportunely spaced from the ventricular electrodes (16) and located upstream of them, in order to allow stimulation and probing of the auricle.

<CLAIMS>
Electrocatheter for sequential cardiostimulation, comprising one or more
atrial electrodes and one or more ventricular electrodes connectable to a

dual-chamber pace-maker by means of corresponding interface connectors,
suitably shaped to allow the insertion thereof into the coronary sinus so as

to position the atrial electrodes within the coronary sinus in correspondence
of the left atrium of the heart and the ventricular electrodes within the great

cardiac vein where the anterior interventricular begins in correspondence of
the left ventricle, said ventricular electrodes (16) being located on the distal

end of the catheter to allow for ventricular stimulation and sensing and the
atrial electrodes (14) being suitably spaced from the ventricular ones (16)

and located upstream of the latter, so as to allow for the heart left atrial
stimulation and sensing 
characterized in that
 it comprises: - a first section
with two straight portions which are angularly spaced by an angle (17) in a

range of 50° to 90° and joined by a curvilinear portion (13), the first straight
portion being in correspondence of the connectors (10) for the connection

with the pace-maker and the second portion being provided with atrial
electrodes (14); - a second section, of diameter lower than the first one, that

is, less than 2 mm, at the free end of which the ventricular electrodes (16)
are disposed and which develops on the extension of the longitudinal axis of

said portion including the atrial electrodes (14).
Electrocatheter according to claim 1 
characterized in that
 said atrial
electrodes (14) are positioned at a distance of 50 to 80 mm from the tip of

the catheter. 
Electrocatheter according to claim 1 
characterized in that
 the number of said
atrial electrodes (14) is two: the distance between the two atrial electrodes

(14) being comprised between 5 and 20 mm.
Electrocatheter according to claim 1 
characterized in that
 the number of said
ventricular electrodes (16) is two: the distance between the two ventricular

electrodes (16) being comprised between 5 and 20 mm.
Electrocatheter according to claim 1 
characterized in that
 the active surface
of said atrial electrodes (14) is made to face the concavity (13) of the

catheter.
Electrocatheter according to claim 1 
characterized in that
 the active surface
of said atrial electrodes (14) is ring-like developed, along the whole

circumference of the corresponding length of the catheter.
Electrocatheter according to claim 1 
characterized in that
 it comprises a
plurality of conductors in the form of a multiwire spiral intended to power

said atrial and ventricular electrodes (14, 16), and 
in that
 it is provided with a
guide mandrel inserted said multiwire spiral to allow its stiffening and

guiding during implantation.
Electrocatheter according to claims 1 and 7 
characterized in that
 it has a
tubular form, made of flexible material to allow its implantation within the

coronary sinus, and biocompatible, such as silicone or polyurethane, within
which may be inserte
d the said multiwire spiral.
Electrocatheter according to claim 1 
characterized in that
 it is made by a
plurality of metallic coaxial spirals, isolated to each other and to the outside

by means of corresponding tubular elements, made in flexible, insulating
and biocompatible material.
