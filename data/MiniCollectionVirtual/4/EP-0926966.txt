<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a toothbrush (10) with bristles (12) at the top and a handle (14) including means for maintaining the brush in vertical storage position, characterised in that the brush (10) handle (14) is longitudinally divided in its upper part into at least two branches (16, 18, 20) articulated between an open position for storage wherein the free ends (22, 24, 26) of the branches (16, 18, 20). mutually spaced, form support points for the brush (10) on a horizontal surface, and a closed position wherein the branches are brought together for the toothbrush (10) to be used.

<CLAIMS>
Toothbrush (10) of the type possessing a bristled head
(12) and a handle (14) comprising means for supporting the

brush in a vertical storage position, 
characterised in that
 the
handle (14) of the brush (10) is divided lengthwise from its

upper part into at least two branches (16, 18, 20) pivotable
between an open storage position in which the free ends

(22, 24, 26) of the branches (16, 18, 20), at a distance from
each oth
er, form the points whereby the brush (10) bears on a
horizontal surface, and a closed position in which the branches

(16, 18, 20) are united for the use of the toothbrush (10).
Toothbrush (10) according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the branches (16, 18, 20) are moved back resiliently into
the open position.
Toothbrush (10) according to Claim 2, 
characterised in
that
 the brush comprises means for retaining the branches (16,
18, 20) in the closed position.
Toothbrush (10) according to Claim 3, 
characterised in
that
 the means for retaining the branches (16, 18, 20) of the
brush (10) in the united position are formed by a ring (28)

which slides lengthwise along the handle (14) and whose
internal profile is complementary to the external profile of the

handle (14) in the closed position of the branches.
Toothbrush (10) according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the handle (14) is divided into
three branches (16, 18, 20) distributed angularly in a regular

manner around the longitudinal axis of the handle.
Toothbrush (10) according to Claim 5, 
characterised in
that
 the handle (14) is produced from a single piece of plastic,
split lengthwise into three branches (16, 18, 20). 
Toothbrush (10) according to Claim 6, 
characterised in
that
 the toothbrush (10) is produced from a single moulded
piece comprising the handle (14) and the head (12).
Toothbrush (10) according to either of Claims 6 and 7,

characterised in that
 the hinge of each branch (16, 18, 20) is
formed by a thin portion (38, 40) situated at the upper end (36)

of the branch.
Toothbrush (10) according to Claim 8, 
characterised in
that
 the thin portion (38, 40) is situated on the internal surface
of the branch (16, 18, 20), thus defining, in the united position

of the branches, an internal cavity (42) in the handle (14).
Toothbrush (10) according to any one of Claims 6 to 8
taken in conjunction with Claim 5, 
characterised in that
 one of
the slits (29) between two adjacent branches is perpendicular

to a longitudinal plane parallel to the head (12) of the brush
and is situated on the same side as the bristled surface of the

head.
