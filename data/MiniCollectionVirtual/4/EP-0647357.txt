<ABSTRACT>
According to the method of the invention, conductive leads are directly wired onto a semiconductor wafer carrying a large number of chips, the wafer is bonded to a resilient film and cut to separate each chip, after which the film is stretched to space the chips; the totality of the chips and leads are then held in an insulating material such as a polymerizable resin, and, after polishing, metal plating is applied over the leads to connect them to the sides of the chips; the assembly is then cut in order to separate the chips.
