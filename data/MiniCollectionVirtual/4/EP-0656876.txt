<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of 2-n-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol from 2-ethyl hexanal and formaldehyde by using a basic alkali metal hydroxide or earth alkali metal hydroxide catalyst. In the process according to the invention, cationic or neutral phase transfer catalysts are additionally used for promoting the reaction. The correct choice of the sources of the initial material components is also essential. 2-n-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol is used, for example, in the paint industry in the preparation of pulverous paints.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the invention is a new, technically simple but
efficient process for the preparation of 2-n-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane
diol from 2-ethyl hexanal and formaldehyde. The
invention is based on correctly selected sources of the initial
components and on the use of correctly selected catalysts.2-n-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol is a compound known per se,
which is used, for example, in the preparation of polyesters
and in the paint industry as one component of pulverous paints.
The advantages of the compound include its very good UV
shield and its very low adsorption of water.The preparation of 2-n-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol from 2-ethyl
hexanal and formaldehyde by aldol addition, and so-called
Cannizzaro reaction immediately following it, is per se
known in organic chemistry. The said reactions are achieved by
using in the reaction a basic alkali metal hydroxide or earth
alkali metal hydroxide catalyst.Japanese patent publication JP-48 043 085 describes a process
for preparing 2-n-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol from 2-ethyl
hexanal and formaldehyde in the presence of a basic alkali
metal hydroxide, in two steps, in the first of which a selective
aldol condensation was allowed to occur at 30-60°C, the
pH being 8-11. In the second step, a selective cross-Cannizzaro
reaction was performed at 65-90°C at pH 8-11.
However, the methods for the isolation and purification of the
2-n-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane diol obtained as the final product
are not reported, nor is the yield of final product.JP patent publication 62 129 233 discloses a process for the
preparation and purification of 2-n-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane
diol. In this process, the reaction mixture which is obtained
as a result of a reaction of 2-ethyl hexanal and formaldehyde 
in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide or an earth
alkali metal hydroxide and water and which contains 2-n-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane
diol is neutralized with an organic acid
or a mineral acid, the organic phase is separated, and one
part of the organic phase is washed, once or several times,
with 0.01-2 parts of water in order to remove the formaldehyde.
Finally the organic phase is vacuum distilled. For this
process, a final product yield of 91.9 % is reported when the
initial material used was paraformaldehyde.In JP patent publication 2 062 836, the yield and grade of 2-n-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane
diol has been improved by adding
to a mixture of 2-ethyl hexanal and formaldehyde in the presence
of an alkali metal hydroxide in a heterogenous system 2
% by weight
