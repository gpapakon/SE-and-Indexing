<ABSTRACT>
A stent delivery catheter system (10) employing a 
retractable protective sheath (50) for protecting a body lumen 

from the stent (55) as the stent (55) is being delivered by the 
catheter. The catheter (10) has a plurality of lumens (15,25,30), with 

at least one lumen (25) devoted to housing a rod, wire or 
hypotube (45) that retracts the protective sheath (50). The lumen (25) 

housing the retracting member (45) can carry a flushing fluid 
to purge the distal portion of the catheter (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a protective covering,
membrane or sheath for a stent delivered by a balloon
dilatation catheter, such as the kind used in percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
procedures.In typical PTCA procedures, a guiding catheter
is percutaneously introduced into the cardiovascular
system of a patient through the brachial or femoral
arteries and advanced through the arteries until the
distal end is in the ostium of the desired coronary
artery. A guidewire and a dilatation catheter having a
balloon on the distal end are introduced through the
guiding catheter with the guidewire sliding within an
inner lumen of the dilatation catheter. The guidewire is
first advanced out of the guiding catheter into the
patient's coronary vasculature and the dilatation
catheter is advanced over the previously advanced
guidewire until the dilatation balloon is properly
positioned across the lesion. Once in position across
the lesion, the preformed balloon is inflated to a
predetermined size with radiopaque liquid at a relatively
high pressure to compress the atherosclerotic plaque of
the lesion against the inside of the artery wall and
dilate the artery. The balloon then is deflated to a
small profile, so that the dilatation catheter can be
withdrawn from the patient's vasculature and blood flow
through the dilated artery can resume.In angioplasty procedures of the kind
referenced above, there may be restenosis of the artery,
which may require another angioplasty procedure or a
surgical bypass operation to correct. To help prevent 
abrupt closure, dissection, or restenosis, a physician
can implant an intravascular prosthesis for maintaining
vascular patency, called a stent, inside the artery at
the lesion. The stent is expanded to a larger diameter,
often by a balloon catheter. The stent is left in the
artery, either temporarily or permanently, at the site of
a dilated lesion.The stent is delivered to the dilated lesion
site by a catheter. The stent may have protuberances on
its outer surface facing the wall of the lumen of the
patient's artery. If such protuberances rub against the
wall during delivery of the stent, the protuberances may
damage the lumen and cause the stent to be displaced
prematurely from the catheter.In order to counteract these problems it is known
to cover the stent with a protective sheath. For
example, in US-A-5,158,548 there is described a stent
delivery system having an expandable stent in a
contracted condition positioned on an expandable
member, such as an
