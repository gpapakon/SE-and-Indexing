<ABSTRACT>
The nut has a central and axial threaded hole (7) for a threaded bar. A number of discs (1) rest on the outside of the conical nut (2) whose first end has a smaller periphery than the second end (6). The conical nut is movable axially in the discs. The end of the discs facing the second end of the conical nut carry a thrust-piece (4) gripping over the conical nut from outside for axially supporting the threaded bar.

A rock or concrete anchor with a polygonal or round cone nut
(2), which supports a threaded bore (7) extending

approximately centrally and in an axial direction for a
threaded rod (16), and with a plurality of plates (1)

resting against the outside of the cone nut, the cone nut
comprising a first end of reduced circumference and a second

end (6) of greater circumference and the cone nut being
displaceable in the plates in the axial direction, wherein,

at their end associated with the second end (6) of the cone
nut, the plates support an abutment (4) engaging over the

cone nut from the outside for axially supporting the
threaded rod, 
characterised in that
 the plates (1) each
comprise at least one attachment(4), which engages radially

over the cone nut (2) and is directed inwards and in that
the plates (1) are integral with the abutment (4).
A concrete or rock anchor according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the threaded rod (16) can overcome the
abutment (4) above a given torque .
A concrete or rock anchor according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 a total of three plates (1)
are provided.
A concrete or rock anchor according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the surface (8) of each plate
(1) facing the cone nut (2) is angled in the manner of a

roof at an angle of 120° to 130°, preferably 125°.
A concrete or rock anchor according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the surface of each plate (1)
remote from the cone nut (2) supports at least one groove

(3) extending in the circumferential direction. 
A concrete or rock anchor according to claim 5,

characterised in that
 a circumferential securing means (10),
which secures the plates (1) around the cone nut (2), is

associated with the grooves (3).
A concrete or rock anchor according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the surface (8) of each plate
(1) facing the cone nut (2) supports at least one groove (3)

extending in the circumferential direction, in which a
spring means engages, which forces the plates (1) in the

region of the first end away from the cone nut (2).
