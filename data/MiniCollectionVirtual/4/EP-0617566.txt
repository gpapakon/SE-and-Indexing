<ABSTRACT>
In a system wherein a plurality of communication terminals are 
connected with one another, or the mobile communication terminals 

and fixed communication terminals are connected with one another 
by a switchboard through a base station, the present invention discloses 

a system which registrates a call area of each mobile communication 
terminal to the switchboard through the base station. The system 

includes the switchboard (300), a plurality of base stations (200, 
210) connected to this switchboard (300) and mobile communication 

terminals (100, 110) connected wireless to the base stations (200, 210), 
respectively. The mobile communication terminals (100, 110) registrate 

their own call area positions to the switchboard (300) through 
the base stations (200, 210), respectively. A registration procedure for 

registering the call area includes a first position registration sequence 
and a second position registration sequence. The first position registration 

sequence includes a procedure for authenticating whether or 
not the mobile communication terminal (100, 110) sending the position 

registration request to the switchboard (300) is the terminal the 
use of which is permitted in this system. The second position registration 

sequence is executed when the mobile communication terminal 
(100, 110) has already made the position registration to the switchboard 

(300) in this system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a location 
registration system for a movable communication terminal. 
More particularly, it relates to a system which registers an 
access area of the movable communication terminal via a 
base station in a switch, wherein the plural movable 
communication terminals or a movable communication terminal 
and a fixed communication terminal are connected each other 
via the base station by the switch. Recently, the development of a movable communication is 
remarkable, and particularly, it is extensively used 
because it is handy to carry the movable communication 
terminal. The movable communication system using the movable 
communication terminal is as shown in Fig. 1. The plural 
base stations 200 and 210 are connected to the switch 300. 
And each base station has the access areas A and B. The switch 300 is also connected to general  
 
communication terminals, not shown in Fig. 1, via a public 
network 400 and other switch 500. The plural movable communication terminals 100 and 110 
within the access areas A and B, and the base stations 200 
and 210 are connected by a radio. Further, when one 
movable communication terminal and other one, or the movable 
communication terminal and the other general communication 
terminal are connected by the switch 300, the switch 300 
accesses the movable communication terminals 100 and 110 
via the stations 200 and 210 controlling the access areas A 
and B, in which the movable communication terminals 100 and 
110 exist. Accordingly, it is always required for the movable 
communication terminals 100 and 110 to register the existing 
locations, that is, the access areas A and B, for the 
switch 300. However, the location is moved frequently depending on 
carrying the terminal because it is handy to carry out the 
movable communication terminal. Accordingly, the time of 
performing the location registration for the switch 300 
increases much more. On the other hand, in performing the location 
registration, the switch 300 executes an authentication 
procedure whether the movable communication terminals 100 
and 110 are exact terminals permitted to communicate on the 
system or not, every time the location registration is 
performed.  In this respect, the processing amount on the switch 
300 in the execution of the conventional location 
registration becomes larger. However, it is not always 
necessary that the authentication procedure for the movable 
communication terminals is performed every time the location 
registration is
