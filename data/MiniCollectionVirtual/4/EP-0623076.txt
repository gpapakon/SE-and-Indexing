<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pulling hook for pulling trailers or the like, said hook being provided with means for fastening an actual hook member (1) removably to a pulling hook hitching means (2), which is in turn fastened to a vehicle. A quick coupling means (9) is provided for bringing the overlapping components (21, 2) to press against each other and to lock. The quick coupling means (9) is journalled to connecting means (21) included in hook member (1). The hitching means (2) is provided with a groove (13) intended for an eccentric surface (12) included in quick coupling means (9). Tightening of quick coupling means (9) produces on hook member (1) a force capable of pressing the abutting faces (5, 7) of hook member (1) against the respective abutting faces (6, 8) of hitching means (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pulling hook for 
pulling caravans, trailers or the like, said pulling hook 
being provided with locking means for removably fastening 
the actual hook member to a pulling hook hitching means, 
which in turn is secured to a pulling vehicle, the actual 
hook member including a connecting means which is adapted 
to at least partially overlap the hitching means, whereby 
the overlapping portions of the hook member and hitching 
means are provided with abutting faces for limiting the 
relative movement thereof and also provided is a quick 
coupling means for bringing the abutting faces of the 
overlapping portions to press against each other and for 
bringing the overlapping portions to lock removably 
relative to each other, said quick coupling means 
comprising an axle stub, journalled to be rotatable 
transversely relative to the common centre axis of the 
connecting means and hitching means and provided in a 
certain rotational zone of the quick coupling means with a 
recess as well as in another rotational zone of the quick 
coupling means with an eccentric surface whereby, in a 
certain rotational position of the quick coupling means, 
the connecting means and hitching means can be threaded in 
an overlapping position past the quick coupling means 
whereafter, upon rotating the quick coupling means, the 
abutting faces of the hook member connecting means and 
hitching means are pressed against each other for locking 
said means relative to each other. The Applicants' earlier Finnish Patent 74657 discloses a 
disengageable pulling hook which, however, requires 
relatively strict limitations for manufacturing tolerances 
and, thus, manufacturing of such pulling hook is 
relatively expensive. The structural costs in this prior  
 
known solution are also increased by the fact that the 
moving components of the pulling hook are included in a 
portion of the pulling hook permanently mounted on a 
vehicle and this, in turn, requires certain protective 
precautions for securing the continuous operation of these 
components. An object of the invention is to provide a pulling hook, 
wherein the actual hook member is adapted in a simple and 
quick fashion - without separate tools - to be uncoupled 
and coupled and which pulling hook, in order to keep 
manufacturing costs low, can be produced with relatively 
loose manufacturing tolerances and which hook also 
includes all moving parts in the removable portion of the 
pulling hook and, thus, when the hook is removed and 
stored
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A pulling hook for pulling caravans, trailers or the 
like, said pulling hook being provided with locking means 

for fastening an actual hook member (1) removably to a 
pulling hook hitching means (2), which is in turn secured 

to a pulling vehicle, whereby a connecting means (21) for 
actual hook member (1) is adapted to at least partially 

overlap said hitching means (2), the overlapping 
components (21, 2) of hook member (1) and hitching means 

(2) being provided with abutting faces (5, 6, 7, 8) for 
limiting the relative movement of said components, and 

also provided is a quick coupling means (9) for bringing 
the abutting faces (5, 6, 7, 8) of overlapping components 

(21, 2) to press against each other and for bringing said 
overlapping components (21, 2) to lock removably relative 

to each other, said quick coupling means (9) comprising an 
axle stub, journalled to be rotatable transversely 

relative to the common centre axis (23) of connecting 
means (21) and hitching means (2) and provided in 

alignment with said axis (23) in a certain rotational zone 
of quick coupling means (9) with a recess (11) as well as 

in another rotational zone of the quick coupling means 
with an eccentric surface (12) whereby, in a certain 

rotational position of quick coupling means (9), said 
connecting means (21) and hitching means (2) can be 

threaded in an overlapping position past said quick 
coupling means (9), whereafter, upon rotating the quick 

coupling means, said abutting faces (5, 6, 7, 8) of the 
connecting means (21) and hitching means (2) of hook 

member (1) are pressed against each other for locking said 
components (21, 2) relative to each other, 
characterized
 
in that said quick coupling means (9) is 

journalled to the connecting means (21) of hook member 
(1), that said hitching means (2) is provided with a  

 
groove (13), extending transversely relative to its 

longitudinal axis (23) and intended for the eccentric 
surface (12) of quick coupling means (9), said groove 

preferably comprising a section of a circular cylinder, 
that the abutting faces of hook member (1) comprise a
