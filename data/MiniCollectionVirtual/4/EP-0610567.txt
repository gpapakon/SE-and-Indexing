<ABSTRACT>
In order to develop a silo vehicle (100) with tubular pressurised containers (11) which rest at least partially on a towing vehicle, are closed off at the ends by floor elements and have at least one at least semicylindrical upper shell (14) and at least two at least semicylindrical lower shells (18, 19, 20) in such a way that the space, for the arrangement of the load container, which is limited with respect to the height and the width of the silo vehicle is utilised to an optimum degree and in that at the same time a simple design of the silo container is achieved, in which case the load-dependent and pressure-dependent possible stresses are to correspond to those of known pressurised containers or surpass them, it is proposed that each upper shell (14) has a cross-sectional face (Q1) which is surrounded by it and is a circular segment which is larger than a semicircle by a certain amount, that each lower shell (18, 19, 20) has a cross-sectional face (Q2) which is surrounded by it and is a circular segment which is larger than a semicircle by a certain amount, and that the lines (21, 22), lying opposite one another, of contact of each upper shell (14) with the lower shell (18, 19, 20) respectively assigned to it be connected to one another by means of tie rods (25).

Silo vehicle (100) with tubular pressure container 
or tank (11) partly suported on a truck tractor and 

closed at the front end by means of bottom pieces 
with at least one semicylindrical top shell (14) 

and at least two semicylindrical bottom shells (18, 
19, 20),
characterized in that
 
each top shell (14) possesses a cross-sectional area 

(Q1) comprised by the same which is a segment of a 
circle that is larger by a certain amount than a 

semicircle,
 
in that each bottom shell (18, 19, 20) possesses a 

cross-sectional area (Q2) comprised by the same 
which is a segment of a circle that is larger by a 

certain amount than a semicircle,
 
in that the oppositely located contact lines (21, 

22) of each top shell (14) are, by means of tie 
rods (25), interconnected with the bottom shell (18, 

19, 20) allocated to the latter in each case,
 
in that each contact line (21, 22) is formed by a 

flat metal band (23, 24), preferably steel or aluminium 
band,
 
and in that each metal band (23, 24), within the 

area of each tie rod (25), possesses a broadened 
transmission body (26;126). 
Silo vehicle according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the cross-sectional area (Q1) of each top shell (14) 

is 10% - 20% larger than a semicircle.  
 
Silo vehicle according to either Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 
the cross-sectional surface (Q2) of each bottom shell 

(18, 19, 20) is 10% - 20% larger than a semicircle. 
Silo vehicle according to any of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that,
 
on each of the two flat sides (23a, 23b) of the 

metal band (23, 24), one of the top shells (14) or 
bottom shells (18, 19, 20) is mounted so as to be 

attached with its abutting area (S). 
Silo vehicle according to Claim 4,
characterized in that
 
each of the top and/or bottom shells is welded onto 

the metal band (23, 24). 
Silo vehicle according to either Claim 4 or 5,
characterized in that
 
two oppositely located metal bands (23, 24) each are 

interconnected by means of a plurality of mutually 
spaced-apart tie rods (25). 
Silo vehicle according to any of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that
 
each transmission body (26;126) is detachably connected 

to one tie rod end (27) each. 
Silo vehicle according to Claim 7,
characterized in that
 
the tie rod end (27) is constructed in the form of 

a flat cuboid supporting body (28) corresponding 
in size to a first lateral surface (36) of the transmission 

body (26; 126).  
 
Silo vehicle accordingto any of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that
 
the transmission body (26; 126) is constructed in the 

form of a cuboid body which possesses at least one 
through bore (29, 30), through which one of the mounting 

screws (31, 32) can be passed, which can be disposed 
with its head (33, 34) on a second lateral surface 

(37) located opposite the first lateral surface 
(36) of the transmission piece (26) and which, with 

its shank end, can be screwed into a pertinent tapped 
bore (29a, 30a) in the supporting body (28) of the 

tie rod end (27). 
Silo vehicle according to Claim 9,
characterized in that,
 
in the oblong hole-like recess (35), a reinforcing 

plate (38) corresponding in its configuration to that 
of the recess (35) possessing at least one constricted 

portion (39, 40) for the head (33, 34) of the mounting 
screws (31, 32) is disposed.
