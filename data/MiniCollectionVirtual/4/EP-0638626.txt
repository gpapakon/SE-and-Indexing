<ABSTRACT>
A red-emitting phosphor prepared by mixing 
1 mole of a europium-activated rare earth oxide 

phosphor represented by general formula (L
1-x
Eu
x
)₂O₃ 
(wherein L represents at least one rare 

earth element and 0.01 ≦ X ≦ 0.20) with 10⁻⁶-10⁻³ 
mole of each of phosphorus and at least one alkaline 

earth metal selected from among megnesium, 
calcium, strontium and barium. The phosphor has 

a high initial emission luminance (efficiency) and is 
reduced in the efficiency drop when the light is on. 

The fluorescent lamp of the invention is made by 
coating the inner wall surface of a glass tube with 

a phosphor layer containing the above phosphor at 
least as a red-emitting component and is capable of 

controlling changes in emission efficiency and chromaticity 
with time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a europium-activated rare earth 
oxide fluorescent material and fluorescent lamps using the 
fluorescent material, and more particularly to a red light 
emitting fluorescent material manifesting a high color-rendering 
property at high efficiency and proving to be 
advantageously usable usable as in three band type fluorescent lamps, 
for example, and fluorescent lamps using the fluorescent 
material. It is universally known that a europium-activated yttrium 
oxide fluorescent material (Y2O3:Eu) excels in such fluorescent 
properties as brightness and color of the luminescence excited 
by an electron beam and an ultraviolet ray and, owing to this 
feature, finds utility as a red light component fluorescent 
material for color cathode ray tubes and as a red light 
component fluorescent material for three band type fluorescent 
lamps. Various fluxes have been heretofore studied with a view 
to enabling such europium-activated rare earth oxide 
fluorescent material as mentioned above to acquire an exalted 
luminescent efficiency. For example, such compounds as 
lithium phosphate (refer to JP-A-56-99,276), borates of 
alkaline earth metals (refer to JP-A-55-161,883), aluminum  
 
phosphate (refer to JP-A-58-52,382), barium borate (refer to 
JP-A-59-45,384), oxides of alkaline earth metals (refer to JP-A-58-127,777), 
and barium fluoride·magnesium fluoride (refer 
to JP-A-61-266,488) have been proposed as fluxes for the 
europium-activated yttrium oxide fluorescent material. The fluorescent material using such a flux as mentioned 
above acquires a conspicuous increase in crystal size and the 
fluorescent lamp using this fluorescent material enjoys an 
exalted initial luminescent efficiency. For the reason shown 
hereinbelow, however, the fluorescent lamp entails the problem 
that the luminescent efficiency thereof gradually dwindles 
with the elapse of the lighting time thereof. The process for the manufacture (synthesis) of an 
ordinary fluorescent material includes a step of washing. The 
conventional flux is normally removed at this step of washing. 
In the case of the fluorescent material which is produced with 
such a flux as mentioned above, the decline of the luminescent 
efficiency with the elapse of the lighting time of the lamp 
may be logically explained by a postulate that a minute amount 
of this flux will remain therein after the washing step and 
the residual flux will gradually react with such component 
substances of the fluorescent lamp as glass and mercury. When
