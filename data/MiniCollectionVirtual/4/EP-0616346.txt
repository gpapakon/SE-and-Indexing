<ABSTRACT>
A compact current detection unit which detects a 
failure in a relay terminal and provides a relay terminal 

array which has a failure detection function and is 
compact and easy to assemble The current detection unit 

includes two symmetrical bobbins; a core located within 
compartments of bobbins and has an air gap in it; holes 

in the bobbins which correspond to air gap in the core; 
coil wound on the compartments; and a circuit board 

fastened to the side of one of the bobbins on which a 
Hall element is mounted. A Hall element is inserted 

through and fixed in position by the holes in the bobbins 
and the air gap in the core. If a current is flowing 

through the coil, the lines of magnetic force generated 
in the core are detected by the Hall element located in 

the air gap. If no current is flowing, no lines of force 
are detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a current detection unit 
for a relay terminal array capable of detecting failures 
and containing a number of current detection units. There are many types of relay terminals, including 
relay terminals which are not capable of transmission, 
relay terminals with transmitting capability, and I/O 
relay terminals with, for example, photocoupler input and 
transistor output. Since none of these existing relay terminals is 
capable of detecting relay failures (welding of contacts, 
faulty contacts, and so on) by themselves, faulty relays 
are slow to be detected. This delay leads to 
inconvenience, such as down time until a new relay can be 
installed. To detect a faulty relay, one could use a logic 
circuit which has as its inputs the presence or absence 
of a load current from the relay and an output signal 
from the relay coil. Based on these inputs, the circuit 
could judge whether there were a relay fault. With this 
proposed circuit however, certain problems can occur: 
(1) The range of load current which can be detected 
is limited; (2) There are limitations on the shape and 
dimensions of the current sensor; (3) It is difficult to provide adequate isolation 
between primary and secondary circuits and among the 
different poles; and (4) Such a device cannot be assembled efficiently. A current detection unit according to the 
preamble of claim 1 is known from GB-A-2 219 864.  
 In light of the problems listed above, this 
invention has the advantage of providing a current detection unit 
which is compact and easy to assemble. The current detection unit of this invention is as 
defined in claim 1.  
 The current detection unit operates as follows. 
When a current flows through the coil wound on the core 
compartment of the case, lines of magnetic force are 
generated in the core contained in the compartment. 
These lines of magnetic force are detected by the 
magnetic-to-electric converter element placed in the air 
gap in the core. The magnetic field which is detected is 
converted to an electrical signal and is output as a 
signal indicating the presence of a current. When there 
is no current flowing through the coil, no lines of 
magnetic force are generated in the core. The magnetic-to-electric 
converter element does not detect a magnetic 
field, so a signal indicating the absence of a current is 
output. This current detection unit has a core in a compartment 
provided in a case and a coil which is wound on that 
compartment. A circuit board which has a current 
detect
