<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a highly biodegradable resin 
composition comprising a hydroxyalkanoate polymer and a 

crystallization nucleating agent. The resin composition 
may typically comprise a hydroxybutyrate homopolymer or a 

hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate copolymer and an aromatic 
amino acid. There is also provided a device prepared by 

using such a resin composition. The resin composition of 
the invention is capable of undergoing a crystallization at 

a high speed to provide the article molded therefrom with 
improved properties. The resin composition is also highly 

degradable in an animal body or in the environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydroxyalkanoate polymer
composition, and more specifically, to a resin composition
comprising a hydroxybutyrate homopolymer or a
hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate copolymer. This invention
also relates to a device fabricated from such a resin
composition.Hydroxybutyrate homopolymer and a hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate
copolymer are formed in bacteria or other
microorganisms for their energy source, and these polymers
are biodegradable thermoplastic polyesters which are
decomposed and digested by various microorganisms commonly
present in soil. It is also known that these polymers are
degradable in an organism without stimulating any hazardous
reaction. For example, N. D. Miller and D. F. Williams
disclose that hydroxybutyrate homopolymer and a
hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate copolymer are decomposed in
an organism through a hydrolytic process and an enzymatic
process. See Biomaterial, vol. 8, page 129, 1987. T.
Saito et al. also disclose similar results. See
Biomaterial, vol. 12, page 309, 1991. There is also
reported in J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg., vol. 104, page
600, 1992 that the use of a hydroxybutyrate homopolymer for an
artificial heart membrane resulted in a favorable tissue
response. Hydroxybutyrate homopolymer was discovered several
decades ago. However, it was not put into a practical use
until quite recently since its extraction from the bacteria
and subsequent purification were quite difficult, and since
its decomposition point (183°C) and melting point (180°C)
were too close to enable a uniform molding. Backed by
recent heightening in the interest in environmental issues,
there were developed various techniques for copolymerizing
the hydroxybutyrate with another hydroxyalkanoate (Japanese
Patent Application Kokai (unexamined laid open) No.
57(1982)-150393 and 59(1984)-220192) as well as
purification processes (Japanese Patent Application Kokai
Nos. 57(1982)-174094 and 60(1985)-145097) to enable supply
of lower melting materials with a relatively improved
moldability. Hydroxybutyrate homopolymer inherently
suffers from a lower crystallization speed compared to
other commonly used synthetic materials, and in particular,
hydroxybutyrate-hydroxyvalerate copolymers suffer from a
decrease in crystallization speed with an increase in the
hydroxyvalerate content. In the case of injection molding,
an excessively low crystallization speed would lead to a
difficulty in temperature control upon solidification of
the resin in the mold to result in molding failures due to
an
