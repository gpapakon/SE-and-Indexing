<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides real time call control within a 
telecommunications network, using a call selection processor separate from the 

switches carrying the call, which responds to incoming calls and uses information 

carried in the associated signaling messages to determine what application processor, 
if any, should be involved on the call. One embodiment of the present invention 

includes a call selection processor called a signaling director", or "SD" for short, for 
recognizing certain signaling messages, typically SS7 initial address messages 

(IAM's), as the messages flow through the signaling network. Alternatively, 
particular signaling messages may be recognized in a signaling message processing 

element within the signaling network, such as the signal transfer point (STP) 
associated with the switch that receives the telephone calls, and a copy of those 

particular messages forwarded to the SD.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to telecommunications, and, in
particular, to a telecommunications architecture and system wherein all calls routed
to a switch are examined and processed in a manner that permits "selected" calls to
be differentiated from other calls, so as, for example, to allow the selected calls to
receive special treatment.Telecommunications service providers desire to arrange their network so
that the call processing logic applied to each call can be customized, i.e., each call
given individualized treatment. This is advantageous from the customer (caller)
point of view, since the customer will obtain better service. It is also advantageous
from the network provider point of view, since it enables segment specific strategies,
i.e., allows marketing tailored to individual customer groups.Today's interexchange networks are not arranged to routinely determine
customer identification and provide customized treatment at the time of call
origination. Rather, existing networks have been optimized for "simple" calls, and
such networks handle calls requiring special treatment on an "exception" basis. In
present arrangements, the customer is not identified directly, at the beginning of the
call processing process, so that customer-specific features are applied to a particular
call only after a great deal of processing. The difficulty is illustrated by one example
involving call processing instructions: currently, service type is first identified using
a table that associates trunk group type with service type. Automatic number
identification (ANI) information may be collected from the caller and sent to an ANI
vs customer table, to further identify the customer. Next, the ANI and customer
identification are sent to a customer vs allowed feature table, to obtain a list of
authorized features. Finally, processed data obtained as a result of the foregoing
table look-up is sent back to the switch that is processing the call to execute
whatever call processing is appropriate. Other aspects of call treatment, such as
access and egress determination and recording/billing arrangements, can be equally
complex.The problem with this approach is that the various tables just described
are distributed rather than centralized. These tables have to be provisioned, i.e.,
stored, when a customer first obtains a service or feature, and coordinated among
themselves when a customer makes a change. This is costly, complicated, time
consuming and error prone. Also, there is no central record of "who has what";

<CLAIMS>
A method of processing an originating telephone call in a telecommunications
network, said network including an originating switch (130) for receiving an

originating telephone call and processing said originating telephone call in accordance
with call treatment instructions, and a call selection processor (150);

   
characterised in that
 the call selection processor is connected to said originating switch
(130) for processing signalling messages associated with said telephone call;

   and 
in that
 the method comprises the steps of:

monitoring, in said call selection processor, signalling messages transmitted to
said call selection processor for identifying particular ones of said signalling messages

(IAM) indicating an originating telephone call;
responsive to identification of said particular ones of said signalling messages,
querying a database (160) using information relating to said originating telephone

call, the information being contained in said particular ones of said signalling
messages, for determining based on information in said database if said originating

telephone call requires customised processing; and
if the originating telephone call requires customised processing, transmitting a
message from said call selection processor to said originating switch (130), the message directing

said switch to await said call treatment instructions for the originating telephone call.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said information relating to said
originating telephone call includes calling party and called party information.
A method as claimed in claim 1 and further including the steps of transmitting
a query message pertaining to said originating telephone call to an applications

processor (160); and

   routing a response to said query, the response containing said call treatment
instructions for said originating telephone call, from said applications processor (160)

direct to said originating switch (130). 
A method as claimed in claim 1 and further including the step of processing
the originating telephone call in accordance with said call treatment instructions.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein, if said originating telephone call
does not require customised processing, transmitting a message to said originating switch (130),

the message directing said originating switch (130) to proceed with the processing of said
originating telephone call using default call treatment instructions.
A system of processing an originating telephone call in a telecommunications
network, said network including an originating switch (130) for receiving said

originating telephone call and processing said originating telephone call in accordance
