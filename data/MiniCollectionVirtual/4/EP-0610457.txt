<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device intended to influence the air flow past vehicles, in particular cabriolets, the device being designed to be stowed away in the vehicle (by folding or rolling) so that it takes up little space when not in use. The use of simple fastening means, such as hooks, eyes, hook and loop type fasteners and elastic tapes (8), makes it possible to erect the frameless device rapidly.

Device for influencing air flows in cabriolets or similar 
vehicles, consisting essentially of fabric sheet disposed 

approximately horizontally in order to cover the space 
above the rear seats and directed diagonally upwards and 

forwards in order to cover the space behind the front 
seats, characterized in that the fabric sheet (2) is edged 

on all sides by flexible means (3) and comprises 
horizontally disposed stiffeners (4) merely at the front 

upper end, at the rear end and therebetween at the angled 
transition from the horizontally disposed part (2a) to the 

diagonally upwards directed part (2b), the diagonally 
upwards directed part of the fabric surface being provided 

with means for attachment to the backrests of the front 
seats or directly or indirectly to the head restraints 

thereof or, where appropriate, to a rollover bar (7) and 
the end points of the stiffeners between the horizontal 

part of the fabric sheet and the diagonally upwards 
directed part and the end points of the stiffener at the 

rear end being engaged by flexible straps (8) or similar, 

the free ends of said flexible straps (8) being brought 
together on either side and being provided with securing 

means in such a manner that the straps, directed 
diagonally forwards, are able to be secured at suitable 

points on the sides of the vehicle in order to keep the 
fabric sheet taut. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
flexible means (3) edging the fabric sheet (2) at the rear 

end are of such width that the upper parts of the  
 

backrests are covered and the stiffener (4) is behind the 
backrests. 
Device according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 
tapes or similar, possibly tapes (10) suitable for a hook-and-pile 

fastener, are attached to the flexible means (3), 
with which tapes (10) the fabric sheet (2), rolled up or 

folded up, is able to be wrapped up by means of the wide 
flexible means (8) and to be tied by the tapes (10). 
Device according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the stiffeners (4) consist of metal bars or metal tubes. 
Device according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
the stiffeners (4) consist of plastic rails or similar. 
Device according to claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
special adapters, preferably made of plastic, are provided 

for attaching the upper front end of the fabric sheet (2) 
to the head restraints of the front seats, said special 

adapters engaging the holders of the head restraints. 
Devices according to claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 
the flexible means (3) for edging the fabric sheet (2) are 

provided with slits in the region of the stiffeners (4), 
through which slits securing and/or tightening straps (8) 

are able to be attached to the stiffeners (4). 
Device according to claims 1 to 7, characterized in that 
press studs are provided, by means of which press studs  

 
securing and/or tightening straps (8) are able to be 

attached to the fabric sheet (2). 
Device according to claims 1 to 8, characterized in that 
the fabric sheet (2) consists of metal. 
Device according to claims 1 to 9, characterized in that 
the fabric sheet (2) is coloured. 
Device according to claims 1 to 10, characterized in that 
the fabric sheet (2) is, at least in its diagonally 

forwards directed part, in the form of an advertising 
medium.
