<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing 
substantially flat sheets of glass slightly roughened on 

at least one side, wherein a transparent film is applied 
to a sheet of glass which does not correspond with glass 

and which has a slightly roughened surface. 
This method results in substantially flat glass 
provided with at least one roughened side which is 

characterized by a film of transparent material arranged 
on at least one side of the glass which does not 

correspond with glass and which is provided with a 
roughened surface. 
The Newton effect is prevented in such glass. 
The invention likewise relates to an apparatus for 
manufacturing glass which is provided on at least one side 

with a film of transparent material which does not 
correspond with glass and is provided with a rough surface (9), 

with a device for applying a thin film of material 
curing when heat or radiation is supplied (26), a stamp of 

which the surface has a roughness (44) corresponding with the 
desired roughness of the transparent film, means for 

placing the stamp in contact with the film of curing 
material for at least a short time, and at least one heat 

or radiation source (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing
substantially flat sheets of glass slightly roughened on
at least one side.Such sheets of glass are generally known in the form
of glass sheets which are used in slide transparency
frames, and wherein one side of the glass sheets is
roughened to prevent occurrence of the Newton effect
between the inner surface of the sheet of glass and the
slide.Such roughened glass is otherwise also known in the
form of non-reflecting glass as often used in the framing
of pictures, or in the form of diverse types of frosted
glass.In order to manufacture such types of glass use is
made according to the prior art of acids which apply an
etching effect on the surface of the sheet of glass and
thus cause a roughening of the surface of the sheet of
glass.It will be apparent that in order to etch glass
particularly strong acids are necessary which, because of
their aggressiveness, result in great problems; they even
attack glass, cause danger to health and are particularly
undesirable from an environmental viewpoint. All these
factors result in an increase in the cost price of thus
treated glass.GB-A-536048 describes a method wherein glass is
etched.It is noted that from the article "Embossed gratings
in sol-gel waveguides: pre-emboss heat treatment
effects", Journal of Non-crystalline Solids, Amsterdam
NL, a method is known for manufacturing substantially
flat sheets of glass slightly roughened on at least one
side, comprising applying to a sheet of glass a
transparant film of SiO2-TiO2 in liquid form which is 
different from glass and which has a slightly roughened
surface, and curing the film. In this prior art method
the film is partly baked or cured, subsequently embossed
or stamped and finally baked and cured to obtain the
required hardness.This is a cumbersome method which is difficult to
execute in mass production.The invention provides in a method wherein the
transparant material is UV-curable and wherein during
curing the film is in contact with a stamp having the
relevant roughness.This allows an easier mass production.This method results in a substantially flat glass
which is provided with at least one roughened side and
which is characterized by a film applied to at least one
side of the glass of transparent material which does not
correspond with glass and which is provided with a roughened
surface.Another advantage of thus treated glass is that the
glass is insensitive on the treated side for the greyish
haze otherwise occurring in glass. In a process
