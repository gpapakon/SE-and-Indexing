<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for inductively stirring a molten metal. Magnetic fields are applied to act on the melt through a wall (11) which comprises a magnetic material. Said wall is saturated by a magnetic direct field such that an anisotropically directed magnetic saturation, a low relative permeability, is obtained in the saturation direction (S). A low-frequency magnetic travelling alternating field, comprising components which are located in a plane oriented parallel to said saturation direction and perpendicular to the plane of the wall, is applied superposed on the magnetic direct field, whereby the low-frequency magnetic travelling alternating field passes through said wall with small losses and little damping to apply a stirrer field which provides the desired circulation in the melt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and a device for stirring
a molten metal. More specifically, the invention relates to
inductive stirring of a molten metal which is contained in a
container with a wall, which comprises at least one layer of
a magnetic material.To bring about homogenization and temperature equalization
in a melt and to improve reaction conditions in connection
with refining, degassing and alloying of the melt, the melt
is stirred. By allowing a low-frequency magnetic travelling
alternating field to act on the molten metal, sufficient
electromagnetic forces are generated in the melt to achieve
a good and controllable circulation in the melt. This circulation
stirs the melt such that the desired improvements
regarding homogenization and reaction conditions are
achieved.During the treatment, the melt is contained in a container,
preferably an essentially cylindrical ladle or crucible, and
a low-frequency magnetic travelling alternating field, which
is generated in a coil arranged outside the container, is
applied to the melt.A problem which arises when a magnetic alternating field is
applied to act through a container field are the losses
which occur in the wall, especially when the wall comprises
a magnetic material.Usually, this problem is solved by designing at least that
part of the container wall, through which the low-frequency
magnetic alternating field has to pass to act on the melt,
of a non-magnetic material. Especially in connection with 
ladles in which a molten metal is contained during transport,
refining, degassing, alloying, holding and/or casting,
this leads to increased costs because conventional steels
cannot be used for that part of the shell of the ladle
through which the magnetic alternating field is applied.EP-A-0 391 067 describes an induction furnace comprising a
metallic crucible with one or more induction coils surrounding
the crucible. The purpose of the induction coil of the
induction furnace is not to stir molten metal but to melt
metal by eddy currents induced in the metal by the magnetic
field. The problem to pass the electric field through the
wall of the crucible is solved in EP-A-0 391 067 by dividing
the wall of the crucible into a plurality of vertically extending
segments which are spaced apart from one another to
form small gaps between adjacent segments. These gaps are
filled with electrically insulating material. The magnetic
field is supposed to penetrate into the crucible through
these electrically non-conducting gaps. The idea of the EP-A-0
