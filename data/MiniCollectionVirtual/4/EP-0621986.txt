<ABSTRACT>
Conductor rail system, comprising one or more conductor rails consisting of two or more electric conductors (3b) laid longitudinally in the rail and an insulation (1) between them, in which the connection between rails or between a rail and an electric appliance is effected using one or more junction parts belonging to the system. The conductors of the rails are placed in grooves or recesses (2a, 2b) provided in the insulating material. The electric connection between rails or between a rail and an electric appliance or between a rail and a junction part is effected by means of separate interconnectors (4b) in a manner allowing the junction part to be rotated around the rail or oriented in a desired position relative to the rail in a plane transverse to the rail.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a conductor rail system as defined in the 
introductory part of claim 1. In current use there are various electrical installation systems consisting of 
conductor rails and a variety of junction parts used to connect conductor rails 
to each other and to different electrical appliances. In the present application, the term 'conductor rail system' refers to an 
electrical installation system, and 'junction part' means a junction part used 
to connect 
rails together to form an extension or a branching connection. 'Conductor rail' in this context refers to a rail of a uniform cross-section, 
with conductors placed longitudinally in the rail to carry electric current, As is known, homes, shops, restaurants and exhibition halls etc. are often 
provided with conductor rails to which electrical appliances, e.g. illuminators, 
can be easily connected at any point on a rail. In such systems, the conductors 
are usually placed in grooves provided inside channel-shaped rails, and 
the rails can be extended or branched by using various connectors. A drawback with these systems is that a junction can only be implemented 
in a given direction relative to the cross-section of the rail, either as an 
extension, angle or branching junction, and that a rail 
can only be connected to the rail from one side. This rigid manner of 
connecting conductor rails involves structural limitations.  
 A conductor rail system of the type defined in the introduction is already 
known through WO-A-9 009 687 through the embodiment shown in Fig 1 
there. However, in that system a connection between rails is established 
through a rigid coupling piece, which does not allow any movement of the 
rails in relation to each other. Furthermore, this document also shows how lamp holders have been 
connected to the conductor rail system, so that they can be rotated around 
the rail. DE-A-3 740 549 describes another conductor rail system for connecting an 
electric appliance to a conductor rail. It is in the conductor rail system of 
that document also possible to rotate the electric appliance around said 
rail. The object of the present invention is to provide a conductor rail system of 
the type defined in the preamble of the appended claim 1, which does not 
have the limitations of the conductor rail system according to the stand of 
the art, as for example defined by Fig 1 in WO-A-9 009 687. This object is in accordance with the invention obtained by providing a 
conductor rail system of that type with the
