<ABSTRACT>
Problems may sometimes occur in the manufacture of optical 
disks from polycarbonate compositions. Cloud formation may 

occur notably when short cycle times are used. It has been found 
that cloud formation is eliminated or minimized when 

polycarbonate compositions are used in disk manufacture which 
are free of added release agents. The application relates to 

polycarbonate compositions having an aromatic polycarbonate 
having a weight-averaged molecular weight from 15,000 to 

21,000 which contain no added release agents. The application 
also relates to substrates for optical disks manufactured from said 

polymer mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a polymer composition based on an 
aromatic polycarbonate having a weight-averaged molecular weight 
from 15,000 to 21,000, the composition comprising no release agent. The invention also relates to a substrate for an optical disk 
manufactured from the polymer composition according to the 
invention. Aromatic polycarbonates and their preparation are generally 
known. Aromatic polycarbonates have particular properties as a result 
of which they are particularly suitable to manufacture therefrom 
substrates for optical disks, for example, compact disks for CD-ROM, 
mini-discs and other data storage applications as well as audio and 
video applications, such applications are described, for example, in the 
following patent publications: EP-A-0177713, EP-A-0293769, EP-A-0305214, 
GB 2114501. In these applications, the substrates for optical disks are 
manufactured by injection molding, of a polycarbonate composition. 
During the injection molding the polycarbonate compositions are 
heated and injected into a mold. After cooling, the mold is opened and 
the formed article is taken out of the mold. In such applications the 
polymer mixture always requires the presence of a small quantity of, for 
example, 0.1 to 0.5% by weight, a release agent The release agent 
serves to facilitate the release of the formed article from the mold. In manufacturing articles by means of injection molding, 
reduction of the molding cycle time, i.e. the time between the removal  
 
from the mold of two successively injection-molded articles, as much as 
possible is highly desirable to optimize molding productivity. In 
manufacturing the substrate of compact disks, cycle times of 
approximately 4 to 7 seconds have already been achieved. Upon reducing the cycle time, problems may occur which 
adversely influence the performance properties of the optical disk. It 
has been found, for example, that upon reducing the cycle time certain 
optical problems of the final product occur, namely so-called 'cloud-forming' 
also sometimes referred to by those skilled in the art of optical 
disks as "clouding", "staining" or "ploughing." After the formed 
substrate has been metallized to manufacture an optical disk therefrom, 
large spots, so-called "clouds" are sometimes seen on the surface. 
These clouds are detrimental to the properties of the optical disks: the 
so-called "block error rate"(BLER) and "bit error rate" (BER) increase. 
The BLER and BER are measures of the quality of a compact disk: the 
lower the
