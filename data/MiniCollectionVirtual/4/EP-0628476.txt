<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pressure sensor combination 
suitable for being mounted in the outer wall of a vessel. This 

allows a water pressure-sensitive element of the pressure 
sensor combination to be in contact with the ambient water and 

to determine the water pressure at that location. On the basis 
of the water pressure, the draft and the weight of the load of 

a vessel can be determined. The pressure sensor combination 
comprises a movable valve capable of at least partly releasing 

a passage from the ambient water to the pressure-sensitive 
element and closing same to prevent damage to the pressure-sensitive 

element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pressure sensor device for
mounting in the outer wall of a vessel comprising a basic
housing and a water pressure-sensitive element which is mounted
to the basic housing wherein the basic housing comprises a
bottom face with an opening and wherein the device further
comprises a channel extending from the opening in the basic
housing to the pressure-sensitive element and a movable valve
which is movable between a first and second extreme position
wherein the valve releases the opening in the first extreme
position and closes the opening in the second extreme position.The invention also relates to a vessel provided with such
a pressure sensor device.Such a pressure sensor device is known from the British
patent specification 183,719 and is commonly used for
determining the draft of a vessel and, accordingly, the weight
of the load of the vessel. For each vessel there is a
connection between the draft of the vessel and the
corresponding water displacement, recorded in the Netherlands
in a so-called certificate of tonnage by the national ship
measurement service. According to Archimedes' principle, this
water displacement is directly related to the weight of the
ship and hence also to the load of the ship.A pressure sensor device mounted at a known position in
the wall of a vessel measures the water pressure adjacent to
the wall of the ship. In principle, this water pressure is
directly proportional to the height difference between the
water surface and the pressure-sensitive element of the
pressure sensor device. When this height difference is
determined by means of the pressure sensor device, the draft of
the vessel is known, enabling determination of the weight of
the load.In mounted condition the valve of the above referred to
known pressure sensor device is connected with the basic 
housing by means of a pipeline. The valve itself is located
within the vessel and can only be operated from the inside of
the vessel. Although the opening may be covered by a perforated
convex cover or shoe, a problem of the known device is that the
pressure-sensitive element is not well protected against damage
from objects and dirt floating in the ambient water. Also the
cover or shoe itself runs the risk of being damaged when the
outside wall of the vessel chafes along an object or the bottom
of a river or canal.An inland ship, for instance, will often grind over the
bottom of a river or canal, so that the pressure-sensitive
element may be heavily damaged and consequently becomes
entirely
