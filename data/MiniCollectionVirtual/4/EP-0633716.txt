<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a photosensitive resist film for the manufacture of finely-machined precision parts, by 
which dehydration and baking of a resist film can be done by a short-time heating, the
 resist film formed is of a 
resolution much higher than conventional, and thin-film drying can be performed. After the electrodeposition coating, 

the resist film (2) is rolled by pressure rollers (4) while being heated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photoresist 
film producing method for a precision fine process 
component producing process in which a photoresist film is 
formed by the electrodeposition coating method and 
thereafter the film is subjected to exposure, development, 
etching, and the like. Conventionally, there has been a photo-etching 
method as a precision fine process component producing 
method utilizing a photoresist. The detail of the method 
is disclosed in "Illustrated Explanation of Photo-fabrication" 
written by Takao Hashimoto (Issued by Sougou 
Denshi Shuppan on July 10, 1986). In forming, for example, a wiring pattern on a 
printed wiring board, the pattern is formed by forming a 
photoresist film on a metal material such as a copper-clad 
laminate, exposing the laminate with a pattern mask 
superimposed on the laminate, dissolving the unexposed 
portion with a developing solution, and further etching the 
exposed portion of metal with a metal etching solution. As 
the aforementioned resist film forming method, there can be  
 
enumerated (i) a method of laminating a film having a 
photoresist layer, (ii) a method of coating a liquid-like 
photoresist by dip coating, roll coating, curtain coating, 
or the like, and (iii) a method of forming a photoresist 
layer by electrodeposition coating. The above-mentioned (iii) method of 
electrodeposition coating has drawn attention for the 
reasons of (a) good adhesion to the base material, (b) good 
followability to the surface unevenness, and (c) capability 
of processing hole inner surfaces of a board provided with 
through holes, and the like, and therefore the method has 
been increasingly put into practice in recent years. In the electrodeposition coating process of a 
printed wiring board, there has been conventionally used 
the method of immersing printed wiring boards in an 
electrodepositing solution while suspending the boards in 
the solution in a manner as shown in Fig. 3, flowing an 
electric current, pulling up the board, cleansing the board 
with water, and removing the remaining moisture component 
in the formed film of the printed wiring boards 20, ..., 20 
in a heating dryer 21 while simultaneously heat-fusing the 
film to complete film formation. According to the recent 
trend of the increase in wiring density and fineness of 
printed wiring boards, there has been a growing demand for 
coping with finer circuits and thinner boards.  However, according to the conventional resist 
film drying method, there have been (1) the
