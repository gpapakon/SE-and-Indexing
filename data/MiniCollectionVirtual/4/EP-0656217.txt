a first, second and third section wherein the first section is a 

generally elongated straight section wherein merged with the 
distal end of the first section is a second section which is 

curved in a compound curve, first curving upward in a first 
longitudinal curve and simultaneously curving to the right in a 

second longitudinal curve, wherein the second section merges with 
the third section wherein said third section is a third 

longitudinal curve wherein the plane of the third section is 
angled upward at an angle of approximately 25 to about 60 degrees

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to introducers. More particularly, 
this invention relates to guiding introducers of specific shapes 
for use within the left atrium of the human heart. Introducers and catheters have been in use for medical 
procedures for many years. For example, one use has been to 
convey an electrical stimulus to a selected location within the 
human body. Another use is to monitor and make measurements for 
diagnostic tests within the human body. Thus, catheters may 
examine, diagnose and treat while positioned at a specific 
location within the body which are otherwise inaccessible without 
more invasive procedures. In use, catheters may be inserted into 
a major vein or artery which is near the body surface. These 
catheters are then guided to the specific location for 
examination, diagnosis or treatment by manipulating the catheter 
through the artery or vein of the human body. Catheters have become increasingly useful in remote and 
difficult to reach locations within the body. However, the 
utilization of these catheters is frequently limited because of 
the need for the precise placement of the tip of the catheter at 
a specific location within the body. Control of the movement of catheters to achieve such precise  
 
placement is difficult because of the inherent structure of a 
catheter. The body of a conventional catheter is long and 
tubular. To provide sufficient control of the movement of the 
catheter, it is necessary that its structure be somewhat rigid. 
However, the catheter must not be so rigid as to prevent the 
bending or curving necessary for movement through the vein, 
artery or other body part to arrive at the specified location. 
Further, the catheter must not be so rigid as to cause damage to 
the artery or vein while it is being moved within the body. While it is important that the catheter not be so rigid as 
to cause injury, it is also important that there be sufficient 
rigidity in the catheter to accommodate torque control, i.e., the 
ability to transmit a twisting force along the length of the 
catheter. Sufficient torque control enables controlled 
maneuverability of the catheter by the application of a twisting 
force at the proximal end of the catheter that is transmitted 
along the catheter to its distal end. The need for greater 
torque control often conflict with the need for reduced rigidity 
to prevent injury to the body vessel. Catheters are used increasingly for medical procedures 
involving the human heart. In these procedures a catheter is 
typically
