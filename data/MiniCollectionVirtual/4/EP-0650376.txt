<ABSTRACT>
A device for heating liquids has a cylindrical heat exchanger (10) having a groove (18) on the outside to take a pipe (20) through which the liquid flows. The groove (18) forms turns (w) with a heat transfer length (l) per turn (w). For a given longitudinal section (L) of the pipe (20), the heat transfer length (l) per turn (w) is increased by a factor of 1.4 or the heat exchange cylinder (10) is arranged substantially horizontally and the diameter of the heat exchanger (10) is greater than or equal to 160 mm.

<CLAIMS>
Medical warming apparatus for infusion, transfusion, 
and/or cleansing solutions having a regulatable and/or 

controllable heating device acting on a conduit (20; 35) 
for the solution and heating a cylindrical heat 

exchanging body (10; 30; 50; 60) exhibiting an outer 
groove (18; 34; 51; 61) for the insertion of a conduit 

(20; 35) through which the solution is flowing, the 
groove forming windings with a heat transfer length l 

per winding, characterized in that the heat transfer 
length l per winding assumes a value of at least 52 cm 

and the groove (18; 34; 51; 61) is manufactured in the 
vicinity of its opening from a heat insulating material 

(58) or is coated with a heat insulating material (65). 
Medical warming device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the opening of the groove (51; 61) 

is at least 1.6 times larger than the outer diameter of 
the conduit (20; 35). 
Medical warming device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the groove (51; 61) opens in a 

curved fashion and forms a first groove region (52; 63) 
with groove sides (54; 66) for the insertion of the 

conduit and a second groove region (53; 64), i.e. a  
 

holding groove, with groove sides (56; 68) for holding 
the conduit, wherein the groove sides (54; 66) of the 

first groove region (52; 63) run concave or convex or in 
a triangular shape and the groove sides (56; 68) of the 

second groove region (53; 64) tightly surroundingly 
engage the conduit and, if appropriate, slightly press 

same. 
Medical warming device according to one of the claims 1 
through 3,characterized in that the heat exchanging body 

(10; 30; 50; 60) spans a cross section with respect to 
an axis (21; 38) having a circular or elliptical area. 
Medical warming device according to one of the claims 1 
through 4, characterized in that the heat exchanging 

body (10; 30; 50; 60) is a hollow cylinder. 
Medical warming device according to one of the claims 1 
through 5, characterized in that the groove (18; 34; 51; 

61) runs in a screw-like fashion and the grooves (18; 
34; 51; 61) exhibit, in cross section as viewed along an 

axis (21; 38) of the heat exchanging body (10; 30; 50; 
60), a separation from each other which is larger than 

the groove width of a holding groove for the conduit 
(20; 35). 
Medical warming device according to one of the claims 1 
through 6, characterized in that the groove (51; 61) 

exhibits, in plan view, a groove bottom (57; 67) which 
lies within a groove opening of each individual groove 

(51; 61).
