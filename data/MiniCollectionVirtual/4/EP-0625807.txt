An electric connector (1) comprising an insulating 
body (2) of plastic material having a number of axial 

cavities (3) housing respective electric terminals (4), 
and a recess (8) formed in the rear end of the body (2), 

communicating with said cavities (3), and housing a seal 
(9) having a number of openings (19) enabling insertion 

of the terminals (4) inside the cavities (3) and having 
annular sealing lips (29) cooperating in sealing manner 

with the cables (23) of the the terminals (4); the 
annular lips (29) projecting axially towards the 

respective cavities (3) from a surface (30) of the seal 
(9) cooperating with a number of projections (35) 

originating from the intersections of the walls (5, 6) 
defining the cavities (3), for preventing contact 

between the lips (29) and the walls (5, 6) during 
insertion of the terminals (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric 
connector. Electric connectors are known comprising an 
insulating body made of plastic material and having a 
number of axial cavities housing respective electric 
terminals; and a recess formed in the rear end of the 
body, communicating with said cavities, and housing a 
seal of elastomeric material having a number of openings 
respectively facing the cavities in the body for 
enabling assembly of the terminals inside the cavities. 
Said openings normally present inner annular projections 
or lips, which are deformed radially during insertion of 
the terminals, and, after assembly, cooperate 
elastically with the terminal cables for insulating the 
inside of the connector from the outside environment. Publications FR-B-2407579 and FR-A-2602374 illustrate 
connectors of the aforementioned type wherein the 
openings in the seal also present transverse membranes 
pierceable by the terminals during assembly.  
 This solution provides for sealing against 
external agents in the event not all the cavities are 
engaged by respective terminals, in which case, the 
unused cavities are protected by the unpierced 
membranes. A drawback of known connectors of the type briefly 
described above is that they fail to ensure optimum 
sealing of the cables, particularly when these are 
subject to flexing. To improve sealing performance, connectors have 
been proposed with a seal having openings defining a 
conical inner sealing lip tapering in the insertion 
direction of the terminal, as illustrated in USA Patent 
US-A-4,460,227. Such a seal, however, is limited to 
connectors with a small number of terminals, and wherein 
the center distance of the terminals is such as to 
permit openings having a much larger section than the 
relative terminal, to prevent passage of the terminal 
through the conical sealing lip from expanding the lip 
against the walls of the opening, thus resulting in 
excessive mechanical, and particularly shearing, stress 
on the lip in turn resulting, in extreme cases, in at 
least partial cutting of the lip. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an electric connector designed to overcome the 
drawbacks typically associated with known connectors of 
the aforementioned type.  
 According to the present invention, there is 
provided an electric connector comprising an insulating 
body having a number of axial cavities; a number of 
electric terminals connectable to respective electric 
cables and housed in respective said cavities; and a

An electric connector (1) comprising an 
insulating body (2) having a number of axial cavities 

(3); a number of electric terminals (4) connectable to 
respective electric cables (23) and housed in respective 

said cavities (3); and a seal (9) cooperating in sealing 
manner with said body (2) and facing said cavities (3); 

said seal (9) presenting a number of openings (19) 
facing respective cavities (3) in the body, for enabling 

insertion of said terminals (4) inside said cavities 
(3); and said openings presenting respective annular, 

substantially conical sealing lips (29) cooperating with 
said cables (23); characterized by the fact that said 

annular lips (29) project axially from the surface (30) 
of said seal facing said respective cavities (3); and by 

the fact that it comprises spacing means (35) interposed 
between said seal (9) and said cavities (3), said spacing means being so sized that surface (30) of seal (9) is detached from walls (5,6) by a distance which is greater than the amount by which lips (29) project from surface (30) so as to prevent 

contact between said lips (29) and the walls 
(5, 6) defining the respective said cavities (3), when 

said terminals (4) are inserted through said lips (29). 
A connector as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized by the fact that said spacing means 

consist of a number of projections (35) integral with 
said body (2) and cooperating with a number of portions 

(36) of said seal (9) located between said openings 
(19).  

 
A connector as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterized by the fact that said projections (35) 

originate axially at the intersections of said walls (5, 
6) defining said cavities (3) in said body (2). 
A connector as claimed in Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized by the fact that said seal (9) comprises a 

number of projections (36) designed to cooperate with 
said projections (35). 
A connector as claimed in any one of the 
foregoing Claims, characterized by the fact that said 

seal (9) is housed inside a recess (8) in said body (2), 
and is locked inside the recess (8) by a grid element 

(20) having a number of openings (24) facing said 
openings (19) in said seal (9). 
A connector as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterized by the fact that said grid element (20) 

clicks inside said recess (8) in said body (2). 
A connector as claimed in any one of the 
foregoing Claims, characterized by the fact that said 

seal (9) comprises a number of pierceable membranes (37) 
closing said openings (19). 
A connector as claimed in Claim 7, 

characterized by the fact that said membranes (37) 
comprise a preferential breakthrough portion (38). 
A connector as claimed in Claim 8, 
characterized by the fact that said preferential 

breakthrough portion (38) is a weaker cross-shaped  
 

portion centered on the axis of a respective said 
opening (19).
