<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are methods and compositions for treating a neuroblastoma. The methods include contacting the neuroblastoma with a neurotrophic factor and less than a lethal dose of an inhibitor of cell proliferation for about 1 to 15 days, and then maintaining the neuroblastoma in contact with the neurotrophic factor for an additional 1 to 15 days. The composition includes a neurotrophic factor such as the neurotropin, nerve growth factor, and an inhibitor of cell proliferation such as aphidicolin, thymidine, or hydroxyurea. Also disclosed are methods for inducing the remission or differentiation of, or eliminating, a neuroblastoma.

<DESCRIPTION>
The technical field of this invention relates to
tumor chemotherapy and in particular, to novel methods
and compositions for treating tumors. More
specifically, this invention relates to the treatment
of neuroblastomas with cell differentiation factors and
inhibitors of cell proliferation.The nervous system is derived from multipotential
precursor cells that show a closely regulated inverse
relationship between cell proliferation and
differentiation (Cattaneo and McKay (1991) TINS14:338-340).
In the central nervous system, these precursor
cells commit to a specific differentiation pathway
shortly after the lost mitosis (McConnell (1988)
J.Neurosci.8:945-974; Turner and Cepko (1987)
Nature328:131-136). In the peripheral nervous system,
sensory neurons differentiate following withdrawal from
the cell cycle (Rohrer and Thoenen (1987) J.Neurosci.7:3739-3748),
but sympathetic neurons begin to
differentiate, expressing neurotransmitter systems and
extending short neurites, while still mitotically
active (DiCicco-Bloom et al. (1990) J.CellBio.110:2073-2086).
The molecular basis of the coupling
between neuronal differentiation and cell proliferation
is a problem of current interest.The coupling between neuronal differentiation and
cell proliferation also in relevant to the etiology of
neural tumors, such as neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma
is one of the most common pediatric solid tumors,
frequently occurring in infancy with the primary lesion
in the adrenals and sympathetic chain (Voute (1984)
"Neuroblastoma in: ClinicalPediatricOncology" (W.W. 
Sutow, D.J. Fernback and T.J. Vietti, ed.) pp 559-587).
This tumor is difficult to treat as common modes
of chemotherapy have harsh side effects on normal
infant tissue. Interestingly, neuroblastomas are noted
for their ability to undergo spontaneous regression or
maturation to benign ganglioneuromas (Evans et al.
(1980) Cancer45:833-839). The similarity of
neuroblastoma cells to neuroblasts and their ability to
spontaneously mature to a more benign form suggest
that the disease may originate by a block of
differentiation of a sympathetic precursor cell
(Knudson and Meadows (1980) NewEngl.J.Med.302:1254-1256).
Hence, factors which promote the
differentiation of proliferating neuroblastic cells are
candidates for new therapeutic approaches. Due to the
side effects of cancer therapy, there is great need
for a "natural" but highly-specific tumor chemotherapy.Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a 26,000-dalton
polypeptide neurotrophic factor that mediates a variety
of biological
