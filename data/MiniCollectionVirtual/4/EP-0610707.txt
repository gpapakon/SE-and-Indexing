<ABSTRACT>
A very simple and easy-to-use height adjustable apparatus for the shop sector, but also for the domestic sector, is achieved by a locking sleeve (2) which totally or partially surrounds an extending tube (4) which is displaceable relative to a fixed standing tube (5). In this arrangement, the upper and lower faces of the locking sleeve (2) are shaped in such a way that rotation about an axis (1) perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the extending tube (4) is possible to such a degree that a wedge- or dome-shaped lug (3) on the inner side of the locking sleeve (2) can slide out of an opening (7) in the extending tube (4) and the locking sleeve (2) can then be displaced along the extending tube (4), the wedge- or dome-shaped lug (3) being integrally moulded on the lower inner side opposite the axis of rotation (1) or on the side of the axis of rotation (1) above the axis of rotation (1). When the extending tube (4) is lifted, the locking sleeve (2) rotates owing to its weight independently about the axis of rotation (1), and the wedge- or dome-shaped lug (3) slides out of the opening (7) in the extending tube (4).

Vertically-adjustable device, with

(a) a standpipe,
(b) an extending pipe (4),

(b1) which is disposed to be movable relative
to the standpipe (5) and projects above

the upper end face of the standpipe (5),
(b2) whose circular, oval or polygonic external
profile is identical or similar to the

internal profile of the standpipe (5), and
b3) which is provided on at least one side
with one or a plurality of apertures,

characterised by
(c) a locking sleeve (2) which totally or partly
surrounds the extending pipe (4),


(c1) which has a clear cross-section constant
across the axis of symmetry corresponding

to the external cross-section of the
extending tube (4) so that its entire

inner wall in the locked condition extends
parallel to the outer wall of the

extending tube (4),
(c2) which, in the locked condition, is
supported on the upper end of the

standpipe (5) with the lower end face, and 
which, together with the lower end face

facing the standpipe (5) has an uppermost
point, by means of which an axis of

rotation (1) is defined, lying vertically

to the axis of symmetry of the locking
sleeve (2),
(c3) which is provided with a stop means (3),
which is integrally formed on the lower

inner side, lying opposite the axis of
rotation (1), of the locking sleeve (2),

or on the side of the axis of rotation (1)
above the axis of rotation (1) on the

inner side of the locking sleeve, and
in the locked condition engages in one of

the apertures (7) in the extending pipe
(4), and
(c4) whose upper and lower end faces result
from the penetration curves of extending

pipe (4) and locking sleeve (2), when the
locking sleeve (2) is rotated about the

axis of rotation (1) through such an angle
that the stop means (3) can slide out of

the aperture (7) and the locking sleeve
(2) is displaced along the extending pipe.
Vertically-adjustable device according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the stop means (3) is formed on the inner side of the

locking sleeve (2) in such a way that when the extending
pipe (4) is raised, the locking sleeve (2) rotates

automatically due to the gravitational force of the
locking sleeve (2) about the axis of rotation (1) and

thus the stop means (3) slides out of the aperture (7) in
the extending pipe (4).
Vertically-adjustable device according to claim 1 or
2, characterised in that


the stop means (3) is formed with a contact surface
(3a), which serves for contact of the upper side of

an aperture (7) in the extending pipe (4),
the stop means (3) is in a wedge or cup-shape, and
tapers downward as far as the inner edge of the

standpipe (5),
the angle formed by the lower end face of the
locking sleeve (2) and the taper of the wedge or

dome-shaped stop means (3) is greater than 90Â°.
Vertically-adjustable device according to claim 1,
characterised in that

the upper end face of the standpipe (5) is identical or
similar to the lower end face of the locking sleeve (3).
Vertically-adjustable device according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the upper and lower end faces of the locking sleeve (2)

are formed by diagonal cuts.
Vertically-adjustable device according to claim 1,
characterised in that


the upper surface line which results from the upper
end face on the extending pipe (4), has a lowermost

point (6), which lies at an identical height with or
to a certain extent lower than the uppermost point

of the lower surface line which results from the
lower end face on the extending pipe (4), or which

is at an identical height, or by a certain extent
lower than the axis of rotation (1).
Vertically-adjustable device according to claim 1,
characterised in that the locking sleeve (2) is made of

plastic or casting.
