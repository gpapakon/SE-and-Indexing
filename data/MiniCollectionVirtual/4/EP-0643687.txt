<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an improved process for preparing N-phenyl-N-methoxyacetyl-DL-alanine methyl ester derivatives of general formula (I), wherein R stands for a C1-4 alkyl group; and n is 1, 2 or 3. According to the process of the invention, an alkaline metal salt of general formula (II), wherein R and n are as defined above, are reacted at a temperature between -20  DEG C and 50  DEG C with a methyl-DL-halopropionate. The alkaline metal salts of compounds of general formula (II) are novel substances.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process
for preparing derivatives of N-(2,6-dialkyl
phenyl)-N-methoxyacetyl-DL-alanine methylester
of the formula (I), wherein the substituents
R of the optionally substituted
phenyl group may be straight or branched
chain C1-4alkyl groups.The derivatives of N-phenyl-N-methoxyacetyl-DL-alanine
methyl ester
are substances possessing a known biological
activity: several of them exert a fungicidal
effect. The most known member of this compound
class is N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-methoxyacetyl-DL-alanine
methyl ester (trade name:
metalaxyl), the fungicidal properties of
which were described by F. J. Schwinn et
al. /Mitt. Biol. Bundesanst. Land-Forstswiertsch.
Berlin-Dahlem 178, 145 (1977)/.
This compound is the active ingredient
of several fungicidal compositions used
in various agrarian cultures against infections
induced by mildew (peronospora),
Phytophtora infestans, Plasmopara viticola
and the like.The preparation of metalaxyl
is published in the CH-PS 607,888, according
to which 2,6-dimethylaniline is first reacted
with methyl DL-α-bromopropionate in the
presence of sodium hydrogen carbonate as 
acid binding agent, then methyl N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-DL-alaninate
thus obtained
is acylated with methoxyacetyl chloride
to give metalaxyl.A drawback of the known process
consists therein that, partly due to the
hydrolyzing effect of water arising from
a side reaction, the yield is low, the
alkylating agent, i.e. the DL-α-bromopropionate
ester has to be employed in
a several-fold excess and a considerable
amount of organic wastes loading the environment
is formed during the accomplishment
of the process on an industrial scale.According to the process described
in the HU-PS 202,481 (WO 90/12 783), after acylating 2,6-dimethylaniline
with methoxyacetic acid,
the N-methoxyacetyl-2,6-dimethylaniline
obtained is heated together with a twofold
excess of methyl DL-α-bromopropionate to
120 °C, and after adding sodium methoxide
in small portions to the reaction mixture
obtained, the alkylation is carried out
at 140 °C.The drawback of this latter process
lies therein that methyl DL-α-bromopropionate
reacts not only with 2,6-dialkylaniline
but also with sodium methoxide being present
to give the methoxy ester derivative. As
a consequence of this side reaction, the
reactants should be used in a significant
excess, a fact also shown thereby that
both methyl DL-α-bromopropionate and sodium 
methoxide, respectively are used in a twofold quantity of the
theoretical (calculated) amount.
