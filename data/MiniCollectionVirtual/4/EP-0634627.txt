<ABSTRACT>
Measuring device (10) for quickly and accurately determining the thickness 
of an annulus (56) between two cylindrical members, such as the catalyst retaining 

screens (58, 60) of a radial flow reactor, at any point along its length or around its 
circumference, comprises a wheeled cart having two sets of angularly mounted 

wheels (22, 24) which straddle the inner screen (58) and a pair of spring loaded 
plungers (40) with ball shaped contacts (46) which contact the outer screen (60). 

As the device is lowered into an annulus with a cable (70), a pair of ultrasonic 
transducers (94, 95) positioned inside the cart direct opposed beams radially of the 

annulus to permit the radial distance between the screens to be measured.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for measuring the distance between a pair
of walls, and particularly to a device for measuring the radial distance between a
pair of co-axial cylindrical walls which are spaced apart by an open annular area,
or annulus. An example of a structure which includes such an annulus is a radial
flow reactor of the moving bed type used in the petrochemical industry. Typically,
such a reactor might include an assembly of two vertically positioned concentric
cylindrical screens which are about 8-12 meters high and made of stacked tiers,
each tier being about 2 meters high and formed of three or more curved panel
segments which are welded together. The inner screen might have an outer
diameter of about 1.8 - 2.4 meters and be separated from the outer screen by an
annulus having a radial dimension of about 15-33 cm. In use, the annulus would
be filled with catalyst pellets which are typically a ceramic substrate which is
coated with a costly material, such as platinum. The catalyst pellets form a bed,
through which a gas to be treated would typically pass in its path from an annular
chamber outside the screen assembly to a hollow chamber within the inner screen.
In order to ensure uniform treatment of the gas passing through the catalyst bed, it
is essential that the annulus, and thus the catalyst bed, have a predetermined
minimum thickness, and preferably be of a uniform thickness. If one region is of
substantially less thickness than another, it will present less resistance to flow and
thus result in less contact time between the gas and the catalyst in the particular
region. It would also cause an overall increase in gas flow through the affected
region which could possibly cause "hot spots" to be created in the bed and a
deterioration of the catalyst if the reactor is operated at its highest capacity.
Alternatively, to prevent catalyst deterioration and "hot spots", a reactor having a
non-uniform annulus could be operated at a lower than normal gas flow rate but
this would reduce its production capacity. Furthermore, since the catalyst is
extremely expensive, it is highly desirable that none be wasted by having some
portions of the annulus wider than other portions. In order to ensure that the
annulus is of the proper minimum and maximum dimension, it is essential that it
be measured prior to the installation of catalyst. Measurements are typically
required to be taken at about every 30 cm along the length of the screens and at
every 45° around their circumference, as well as

A measuring device for measuring, at a
plurality of circumferentially spaced locations, the radial

thickness of an annulus (56) defined by the curved outer wall
surface of a first generally cylindrical, tubular-shaped

member (58) which has its axis positioned vertically, and the
curved inner wall surface of a second generally cylindrical,

tubular-shaped member (60) which is generally concentrically
located outside said first tubular-shaped member (58), said

measuring device comprises a cart (10) having an elongated body portion (12)
which has means (80) on at least one end thereof which is

adapted to be engaged by a flexible lowering and lifting means
(72) so that said cart (10) may be lowered freely

under its own weight or raised within said annulus (56) so as
to measure the radial thickness of said annulus at any point

along its length or around its circumference, said elongated
body portion (12) having at least two axially spaced-apart

sets of guide means (24) extending from a first surface (16)
thereof which are adapted to guide said body portion (12) for

vertical movement relative to one of said curved outer and
inner wall surfaces and parallel to the axes of said first

least two axially spaced-apart sets of guide means (24) having

a pair of transversely spaced contact surfaces shaped and
positioned so as to be tangential to the said one of said

at least two axially spaced-apart sets of guide means (24)

relative to each other, with sufficient force to
simultaneously engage both of the curved outer and inner wall

surfaces which define the annulus (56), but with insufficient
force to allow the said at least two axially spaced-apart sets 

of guide means

the cart (10) and to engage the surface with
which the guide means (24) are in contact

so firmly as to cause the cart (10) to
track it in a non-vertical direction,
