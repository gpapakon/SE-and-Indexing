<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cellular radio
telephone set and, more particularly, to a cellular radio
telephone set suitable for use with either the left hand or
the right hand of a user as in a case wherein the telephone
set is used in an automobile.Telephone sets of a portable type can perform speech
communication by using radio waves currently include
cellular radio telephone sets and mobile radio telephone
sets. These telephone sets slightly differ in arrangement
depending on the purpose of use and the like.More specifically, a cellular radio telephone set
has receiver and transmitter sections arranged on the same
surface on which an operation portion is arranged. With
this arrangement, after the user operates the operation
portion with one hand while holding the cellular radio
telephone set with the other hand, he/she can perform speech
communication without changing his/her hand holding the
telephone set.In contrast to this, a mobile radio telephone has
receiver and transmitter portions arranged on the opposite 
surface to the surface on which an operating portion is
arranged. With this arrangement, after the user performs a
dial input operation through the operating portion while the
mobile radio telephone set is held on a holder with the
operation portion facing upward, he/she can pick up the
mobile radio telephone set and perform speech communication
without changing his/her hand holding the telephone set.By receiver and transmitter portions we mean the portions in which a
loudspeaker and a microphone respectively are located. Receiving and
transmitting circuitry may or may not be respectively co-located with the
loudspeaker and microphone.In general, since the subscription contract charges
are high, users seldom have both a cellular radio telephone
set and a mobile radio telephone set. The holder of a
cellular radio telephone set also uses it in an automobile.When a cellular radio telephone is to be used in an
automobile, the user must use both his/her hands to perform
a dial input operation. Such an operation is dangerous
during driving.Another type of cellular radio telephone set is
mounted on a holder with an operating portion arranged on
the transmitter/receiver portion side facing upward to allow
a dial input operation with one hand in an automobile.
According to the cellular radio telephone having this
arrangement, however, the user must change his/her hand
holding the cellular radio telephone set after he/she
performs a dial input operation and picks up the cellular
radio
