<ABSTRACT>
Fuel dispensing nozzles (10), and vapor flow control assemblies (200) useful with such nozzles (10), are constructed to maximize the possibility of collecting all of the hydrocarbon vapors displaced from the vehicle tank and upward through the fill pipe towards the atmospheric opening during filling of the tank with fuel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fuel dispensing nozzles,
including those of the type described in the U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,056,131, 4,057,086 and 4,343,337, and in the
pending U.S. application Serial Nos. 07/706,807, filed
May 29, 1991, and 07/816,748, filed January 2, 1992, and
in particular to those fuel dispensing nozzles having the
feature of vapor recovery, and to vapor flow control
assemblies for use with such nozzles.It is known to provide separate diaphragm
assemblies for vapor regulation and high/low pressure
sensing shutoff features. For example, Healy U.S.
4,056,131 describes a vapor handling arrangement in which
a vapor regulator valve closes when excess vacuum is
applied. A simple diaphragm has one side exposed to the
atmosphere and the other side exposed to a vapor conduit.
Excess vacuum in the conduit draws the diaphragm onto its
seat to close the valve. A second diaphragm disposed
above the first is exposed to the Venturi effect of the
fuel being dispensed. The second diaphragm shuts down
the vacuum by constraining the first diaphragm when fuel
is not being dispensed.Healy U.S. 4,057,086 describes a vapor handling
nozzle with a diaphragm. When the end of the nozzle
spout becomes immersed in fuel, e.g. indicating that the
vehicle fuel tank is full, vacuum generated by the
Venturi effect of fuel delivered through a constrained
passageway in the nozzle causes the diaphragm and an
associated plunger to move upward to interrupt fuel
delivery. Also, when vapor pressure in the fuel tank
exceeds a predetermined level, the diaphragm and plunger
are caused to move downward to interrupt fuel delivery. Healy U.S. 4,343,337 describes a fuel dispensing nozzle with a pair of diaphragms
that operate to interrupt flow when conditions of over-pressure or
underpressure exist.In the dispensing nozzle disclosed in the U.S. 4,057,086 the vapor flow rate is
controlled by a valve which is directly coupled with the fuel valve. Therefor the
vapor flow rate is regulated in accordance with the movement of the fuel valve
caused by actuating the lever arm of the manual fuel valve operator.The dispensing nozzles known from the prior art are not suitable for exactly
controlling the vapor flow. Therefore, fuel vapors displaced from the tank may
not be collected completely or the system may suck ambient air additionally to
the fuel vapor into the underground fuel tank.It is an object of the invention to improve the control of vapor flow in a fuel
dispensing nozzle to optimize the collecting of hydrocarbon vapors as they move
out
