<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector component assembly (20) 
terminates discrete conductors of a multiconductor data 

cable (10). The component assembly includes an insulative 
component housing (22,24) having a mating end for engagement 

with a mating electrical connection device and a cable 
receiving end for terminating the multiconductor cable. A 

plurality of electrical contacts (26,28) are supported by 
the component housing. Each of the contacts has a conductor 

terminating end and a mating connection end. The contacts 
are supported in the component housing in a pair of 

horizontally extending, vertically spaced rows with each 
contact of one row being aligned with a respective contact 

of the other row. The contacts of one row are directly 
electrically shunted to the aligned contacts of the other 

row. Electrical shielding is disposed around the contacts 
and includes a shield extension extending between at least 

two of the contacts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in 
electrical connector components. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a shielded electrical connector 
for terminating a multiconductor cable having vertically 
aligned connector components. In transmitting data signals, electrical connectors are 
commonly used to terminate signal carrying multiconductor 
electrical cables which interconnect the various components 
of the data system. Many data systems require the 
components to be supported in an electrically closed loop. 
A closed-loop system provides for continuity of signal in a 
multicomponent system when certain of the components are not 
interconnected. In order to achieve such a closed loop when the 
components are frequently connected and disconnected, the 
connectors connecting such components use automatic shunting 
mechanisms so that a closed-loop connection is maintained 
even when the connector is in a non-connected condition. 
The use of such shunting connectors in a closed-loop data 
system is shown in numerous patents including: Re. 32,760, 
4,449,778, 4,501,459, 4,508,415, 4,582,376, 4,602,833, 
4,619,494, 4,641,906, 4,653,825, 4,671,599, 4,682,836, 
4,711,507, 4,711,511, 4,731,032, 4,744,769, 4,859,201, 
4,883,433, 4,884,981, 4,891,022, 5,030,114, 5,030,121, 
5,035,647, 5,052,940, 5,074,803, 5,088,934, 5,104,337, 
5,112,243, 5,122,076 and 5,169,346. While the connectors shown in the above-identified 
patents provide adequately for the connection of components 
in a data system, the increasing use of smaller components 
in such systems requires the use of smaller connectors.  
 
However, despite the reduction in size, these connectors 
still must provide closed loop connections. Additionally, these connectors are designed to carry 
signals at increasingly higher data rates. At such higher 
data rates, cross-talk interference between components of 
the connector also increases. Thus, these connectors must 
include adequate shielding so as to reduce cross-talk 
interference between connector components. It is, therefore, desirable to provide a data connector 
of reduced size, which provides adequate shunting to 
maintain closed-loop connections and which provides adequate 
shielding. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
improved electrical data connector. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide data connector components of reduced size which 
provide for adequate shunting. It is a still further object of the present invention 
to
