<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus which is 
useful in the simulated tanning of skin. More 
particularly, the invention relates to apparatus which 
is used in the treatment of skin with dihydroxyacetone 
compositions, to form a brownish coloration thereon. It has long been known that certain compounds form 
pigments when applied to the skin. Products containing 
dihydroxyacetone (frequently simply abbreviated to 
"DHA") have been marketed since the early 1960's, and 
have been found satisfactory by many persons who wish 
to give their skin the appearance of an attractive tan, 
but do not desire to risk the now well-appreciated 
health hazards of exposure to solar or artificially-generated 
ultraviolet radiation. However, some persons have not obtained the 
desired results from DHA applications. A small number 
of individuals develop a coloration which tends to 
appear yellowish or orange. Some others, probably due 
to perspiration, rubbing or washing during the slow 
generation of color as skin components react with DHA, 
or to a lack of care to evenly apply the DHA, develop 
uneven coloration. The chemistry of DHA-skin interaction has been 
investigated by several workers. Wittgenstein and 
Berry published a paper "Reaction of Dihydroxyacetone  
 
(DHA) with Human Skin Callus and Amino Compounds," in 
The Journal of Investigative Dermatology, Vol. 36, 
pages 283-286 (1961), describing work to characterize 
the browning phenomenon. They reported that DHA reacts 
with a number of compounds, including ammonia and amino 
acids, to form a brown color, and theorized that skin 
browning is due to the reaction of DHA with free amino 
groups in the skin, the amino groups probably being on 
arginine molecules which are present in skin proteins. A. Meybeck published "A Spectroscopic Study of the 
Reaction Products of Dihydroxyacetone with Aminoacids" 
in Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists, Vol. 
28, pages 25-35 (1977), and characterized brown 
pigments formed from the reaction of DHA with amino and 
other acids at 100° C. Further experiments at 37° C. 
were conducted to better simulate reactions which may 
occur in the skin: DHA was reacted with the amino acids 
glycine, lysine, alanine, serine and arginine, but only 
glycine and lysine produced significant amounts of 
pigment after 24 hours. It was concluded that DHA must 
act by initially condensing with free amino acids at 
the skin surface, followed by polymerization and 
linking to proteins in the stratum corneum, probably 
through lysine side
