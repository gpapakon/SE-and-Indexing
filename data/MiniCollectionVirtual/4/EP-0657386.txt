<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a process for the preparation of an iridium-based solution in which at least one oxide or hydroxide, which may or may not be hydrated, of iridium, or a mixture thereof, is brought into contact, in the liquid phase, in the presence of a solvent, with hydriodic acid or a compound capable of releasing hydriodic acid, in an amount such that the number of moles of hydriodic acid with respect to the number of moles or iridium is between 1 and 100. The present invention additionally relates to an iridium-based solution capable of being obtained by implementing the said process. Finally, another subject of the invention relates to the use of such solutions as catalyst.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of an iridium-based solution, characterised
in that at least one hydrated or non-hydrated iridium oxide or hydroxide, or a

mixture thereof, is placed in contact, in liquid phase and in the presence of a
solvent, with hydroiodic acid or a compound capable of releasing hydroiodic acid,

in an amount such that the number of moles of hydroiodic acid, with respect to the
number of moles of iridium be between 1 and 100.
The process according to the preceding claim, characterised in that a
number of moles of hydroiodic acid with respect to the number of moles of

iridium between 1 and 50 is used.
The process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that a solvent selected from water, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated

carboxylic acids having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, linear or branched, saturated or
unsaturated carboxylic acid esters having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, or a mixture

thereof, is used.
The process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the placing in contact is carried out under air.
The process according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the placing in contact is carried out in the presence of carbon monoxide.
The process of preparation according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the placing in contact is carried out in the presence of

hydrogen, nitrogen and/or a rare gas such as argon or helium.
The process of preparation according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the placing in contact is carried out at a pressure between 1

and 200 bar.
An iridium-based solution obtainable by carrying out the process
according to one of claims 1 to 7 and in which at least 20% of the iridium with

respect to the iridium engaged is found in a soluble form. 
Use of the solution according to claim 8 as a catalyst or for the
preparation of a catalyst.
The use according to claim 9, characterised in that said solution is used
as a catalyst, or for the preparation of a catalyst, in a process of carbonylation of

saturated or unsaturated linear, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon compounds such
as C

-C
10
 alkenes and alkynes, C

-C
10
 alcohols, halogenated derivatives of said
alcohols, C

-C
20
 ethers, C
3
-C
10
 carboxylic acids, C

-C
20
 carboxylic acid esters, as
well as halogenated derivatives of said esters.
The use according to claim 9, characterised in that said solution is used
for catalysing a reaction of carbonylation of an alcohol in the presence of carbon

monoxide and for giving the corresponding carboxylic acid, in maintaining the
water content and the halogenated promoter content of 0 (excluded) to 10%, the

alcohol content of 0 to 10%, and the content of the ester corresponding to the acid
and the alcohol of 2 to 40%, in the reaction medium; the remainder being

constituted by carboxylic acid.
