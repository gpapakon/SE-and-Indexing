<ABSTRACT>
Two symmetric inner ribs (4,6) form a central constriction (8) for reducing the cut-off frequency of the waveguide. An excitation probe (23) projects into the constriction (8). Two slotted secondary waveguides (14,16) of cross-section less than that of the waveguide line with two ribs, called primary waveguide (12), are thus formed, the central constriction (8) constituting a central slot for the secondary waveguides. Another excitation probe (25) projects into one of the two secondary guides (14). The invention applies to rangefinding and trajectory tracking.

<CLAIMS>
A wave guide line with two symmetrical internal ribs (4, 6) 
arranged to provide a median restriction (8) in the guide and to 

decrease the cut-off frequency of the guide, and with an excitation 
probe (23) plugged in the restriction (8), characterised in that two 

secondary slit guides (14, 16) with a transverse section smaller than 
that of the wave guide line with two ribs, called primary (12), being 

thus formed on both sides of the median restriction (8) constituting a 
middle slit for the secondary guides, another excitation probe (25) is 

provided which is plugged one of the two secondary guides (14). 
A line according to claim 1, wherein both secondary guides (14, 
16) are also internally ribbed (41, 61, 63; 42, 62, 64). 
A line according to one of claims 1 and 2, wherein the ribs (4, 6) 
of the primary guide (12) are formed so as to constitute a rib (41, 61; 

42, 62) in each ribbed secondary guide (14, 16). 
A line according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the two probes 
(23, 25) are disposed to produce two orthogonal fields respectively. 
A line according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the restriction 
(8) of the primary guide (12) is relatively thin in relation to the 

dimensions of its transverse section (7). 
A line according to one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the transverse 
section of the primary guide is a rectangle. 
A line according to claim 6, wherein the restriction (8) of the 
primary guide (12) extends in parallel with the length of the said 

rectangle. 
An end radiating wave guide antenna characterised in that it is 
made of the wave guide line according to one of claims 1 to 7, which, 

further, is also open at one end.  
 
An antenna according to claim 8, wherein the ribs of the ribbed 
primary guide (12) and ribbed secondary guide (14, 16) of the line 

which is open at one end are formed to match the impedances at the 
opening of the line.
