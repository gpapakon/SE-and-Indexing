<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of amplification of data signals in a
network such as Ethernet signals in a local area network using standard
telephone lines (twisted pairs).Standard telephone lines (twisted pairs) are commonly used in local
area networks (LANs). These lines, while not ideal for high frequency
signals, are used because they are found in virtually every commercial
building.The typical data rate of signals transmitted in a LAN is substantially
higher than the frequencies of the audio signals originally intended for
transmission on telephone lines. Consequently, the electrical
characteristics of the twisted pairs are not ideal for higher frequency
signals. These lines exhibit higher attenuation as the frequency rises. For
example, a hundred feet of telephone line might have a loss of 2dB at
5MHz and a loss of 3dB at 10MHz. This frequency-attenuation
characteristic causes a propagated signal having a spectrum of energy to
undergo distortion in time and amplitude. Often, a signal quantitized in
time intervals suffers from intersymbol interference due to this frequency
dependency of attenuation. Accordingly, it is not sufficient to just amplify
the signal transmitted over such a line with an amplifier having a "flat"
response, but rather correction must also be made for the de-emphasis of
the higher frequency. Consider the problem of amplifying a high frequency signal
transmitted over 1000 feet of telephone line. If the frequency response of
the line is measured, an amplifier can be readily built to amplify the signal.
The problem is, however, that each line requires a unique amplifier. Line
characteristics can be quantitized to increments (e.g., 300 feet i.e. 91,44 m) and a deemphasis
assumed thereby allowing the selection of an appropriate
amplifier as a function of line length. But, for example, if an amplifier
designed for a 1000 feet i.e. 304,8 m run is used at the end of a 500 feet i.e. 152,4 m run, a serious
problem can result. Specifically, the amplifier will over-emphasize some
higher frequencies of the data signal. This will result in distortion which
can change one binary state to another in a detected signal.As will be seen, the present invention solves this problem by
providing an amplifier which automatically compensates for line length. An amplifier for amplifying a signal transmitted over a line, where
the line attenuates higher frequencies more than lower frequencies is
described. A plurality of cascaded stages are used, each stage includes a
predetermined amplification
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An amplifier comprising:

a plurality of stages coupled in series such that the
output of one stage is amplified by the next stage in the

series;
each of the stages having a gain-frequency response
favouring higher frequencies so long as the signal being

applied to the input of that stage is below a predetermined
level, and each stage having a substantially unity gain

independent of the other stages when the signal applied to that
stage is above the predetermined level.
The amplifier defined by claim 1, wherein each stage
includes circuitry which causes the stage to self-limit its

gain when the input signal is above the predetermined level.
The amplifier defined by claim 2, wherein each stage
includes a pair of transistors which are biased so as to cause

the current in one of the transistors to flow through the other

of the transistors when the predetermined level is reached.
The amplifier defined by claim 2, wherein each of the
stages includes diodes to provide self-limiting. 
An amplifier comprising:

a plurality of stages coupled in cascade;
each stage having a self-limiting mode entered into
when the level of the input signal to the stage reaches a

predetermined level, below this level each stage providing a
predetermined gain-frequency response which provides higher

frequency emphasis;
each of the stages once entering the mode having a
substantially unity gain-frequency response independent of the

other stages.
An amplifier for receiving an input signal and
amplifying it comprising:


a plurality of stages coupled in cascade;
each stage having a switch means associated with it for
selecting a predetermined gain-frequency response which favours

higher frequencies or a unity gain response;
comparator means coupled to receive the input signal to
the amplifier for controlling the switching means of the stages

such that more of said stages are selected as the input signal
to the amplifier decreases in magnitude.
The amplifier defined by claim 6, wherein the
comparator means compares the input signal to a predetermined

level.
