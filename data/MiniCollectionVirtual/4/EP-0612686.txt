<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for continuously 
producing chlorine dioxide by reacting an alkali metal 

chlorate, sulfuric acid or another chlorine free mineral acid 
and hydrogen peroxide as reducing agent to produce chlorine 

dioxide in an aqueous reaction medium. The chlorine dioxide is 
generated in at least one reaction step comprising at least 

one reaction vessel, by feeding alkali metal chlorate, acid, 
hydrogen peroxide and inert gas to said reaction vessel, in 

substantial absence of added chloride ions, maintaining the 
aqueous reaction medium in said reaction vessel at a pressure 

of from about 400 mm Hg to about 900 mm Hg and at a temperature 
of from about 35°C to about 100°C and at an acidity 

within a range from about 4 to about 14 N and the chlorate 
concentration of between about 0.05 moles/l to saturation, 

withdrawing chlorine dioxide, oxygen and inert gas and the 
depleted aqueous reaction medium from said reaction zone 

without substantial crystallization of alkali metal sulfate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for continuously
producing chlorine dioxide from an alkali metal chloride,
sulfuric acid or another chlorine free mineral acid and
hydrogen peroxide as reducing agent at a pressure from about
400 mm Hg (53 kPa) to about 900 mm Hg (120 kPa), preferably at atmospheric
pressure. In particular the invention provides an efficient
process with high yield of chlorine dioxide and with essentially
no chlorine by-product.Chlorine dioxide in aqueous solution is of considerable
commercial interest, mainly in pulp bleaching, but also in
water purification, fat bleaching, removal of phenols from
industrial wastes etc. It is therefore desirable to provide
processes in which chlorine dioxide can be efficiently
produced. Considerable research is also directed to the
handling of by-products such as chlorine and mineral acid
salts.A number of different processes for producing chlorine
dioxide are known in the art. Several processes use the same
raw materials and produce the same sort of residual products
at similar reaction conditions, the main difference being the
reducing agent.In many processes, alkali metal chlorate and sulfuric
acid are continuously brought to a reaction vessel to which
air and the reducing agent are introduced, usually into the
bottom of the vessel. Then chlorine dioxide and air leave from
the top of the reaction vessel and a depleted reaction solution
is withdrawn for further treatment. It is common to use
more than one vessel whereby the depleted reaction solution
from the first vessel is brought to a second (and further)
vessel together with air and reducing agent for further
conversion of the remaining chlorate. The reaction in the
reaction vessel/s is carried out at about atmospheric pressure.
Reducing agents used in this type of reaction are sulfur
dioxide (the Mathieson process), methanol (the Solvay process)
and chloride ions (the R-2 process). The basic chemical
reaction involved in the process with chloride ions can be
summarized with the formula: 
ClO3- + Cl- + 2 H+ → ClO2 + 1/2 Cl2 + H2O
The other reducing agents are indirect reducing agents, the
direct reaction between chlorate ions and methanol or sulfur
dioxide being very slow. The direct reducing agent in these
cases are chloride ions reacting according to [1]. The
chlorine produced is then reacting with methanol to regenerate
chloride ions according to the formula:
CH3OH + 3 Cl2 + H2O → 6 Cl- + CO2 + 6 H+
or with sulfur dioxide according to the formula:
SO2 + Cl2 + 2 H2O → 2 HCl + H2SO4As
