<ABSTRACT>
Plasma processing treatment characteristics of an 
object (32) are determined nondestructively, prior to plasma 

processing the object (32), by placing an indicator structure 
(38) over at least a portion of the plasma processing surface 

(36) of the object (32), so as to generally conform to the shape 
of the surface (36). The indicator structure (38) is implanted 

and changes properties responsive to the plasma processing 
treatment. The implanted indicator structure (38) is thereafter 

analyzed to determine the treatment characteristics of the 
indicator structure (38). Plasma processing spatial distribution 

and total dosage are determined nondestructively from this 
information and used to establish the plasma processing program 

for the object (32) and to adjust the plasma processing system 
(20) as needed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the plasma 
processing of an object, and, more particularly, to 
nondestructively assessing the plasma processing 
operating conditions required to achieve preselected 
treatment characteristics of such an object before 
plasma processing the object itself. Plasma processing encompasses a family of 
techniques that may be used to alter the surface 
properties of objects in a beneficial manner. To 
cite an example, certain types of tooling, such as 
some stamping and pressing dies, are desirably made 
of a soft material that is readily machined or 
formed. This allows the tooling to be manufactured 
relatively inexpensively. Nonmetallic materials 
made of epoxy and modified epoxy are candidates for 
use as such tooling. On the other hand, the working 
surface of the tooling should be as wear resistant 
as possible so that the dimensions do not change as 
successive parts are manufactured. The surface softness of the nonmetallic 
tooling that permits easy machining results in a 
short useful life of the tool. For production 
applications, an epoxy tool cannot be used without a 
treatment to make the surface more wear resistant. 
It has been found that several types of ion and 
electron treatments of the surfaces of polymers such 
as epoxies and the surfaces of metals can 
significantly increase their useful lives. Such 
treatments include, for example, ion implantation, 
ion deposition and ion mixing, and electron 
bombardment.  
 Ion implantation is a process wherein ions 
are accelerated by an electrostatic potential to 
impact a surface. The energy of the ions causes 
them to be imbedded beneath the surface. A 
sufficiently high dose or concentration of implanted 
ions can significantly increase the hardness of the 
surface layer. In ion mixing, a thin (about 30-60 nm (300-600 
Angstrom)) material layer is first deposited onto a 
surface to be treated, and then the composite 
surface is ion implanted to mix the deposited 
material atoms into the surface. Ion deposition is 
similar to ion mixing except that the accelerating 
energies of the ions are lower, with the result that 
the ions are deposited simultaneously with the 
deposited material layer upon the surface being 
treated rather than imbedded beneath its surface. 
In electron bombardment of polymeric surfaces, 
energetic electrons (100-20,000 volts or more) are 
accelerated by an electrostatic potential to cause 
them to impact into the surface to be treated. The 
use of these treatments produce improved hardness 
and
