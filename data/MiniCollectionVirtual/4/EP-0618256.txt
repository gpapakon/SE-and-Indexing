<DESCRIPTION>
It has been found that the dyeability of synthetic polyamides can be improved by
incorporating into them one or more of the following compounds:
a) a compound having at least one sterically hindered amino group which is selected from
the group of those of formulae (4), (5), (6), (14), (15) and (16)

in which R4 is a group of formula (α)

where R' is hydrogen, C1-6alkyl, C1-4alkoxy or -CO-C1-4alkyl; orb) a synthetic polyamide containing at least one group that is reactive with a hydroxy
and/or amino group of formula VIII
Pa-(CO-R12)m
in which
Pais a nitrogen containing radical of a synthetic polyamide,R12is a group containing one or two sterically hindered amino groups wherein the
amino nitrogen atoms are incorporated in a cyclic structure, and is derived from R12H having a reactive
nitrogen atom that is either an amino group or part of a cyclic group andmis 1 or 2.Preferred groups that are reactive to -OH or -NH2 are e.g. those known as reactive groups in
the chemistry of reactive dyes. More preferably these cyclic groups having at least 2 nitrogen
atoms (separated preferably by one or two carbon atoms), e.g. triazinyl-, pyrimidyl-, 
quinoxalyl-, quinazolyl-, phthalazinyl-, benzoxazolyl- and benzthiazolyl-groups, bearing 1 to
3 chlorine atoms on the carbon atoms adjacent to the nitrogen atoms.The preferred synthetic polyamide of component b) are polymeric isophthalic or terephthalic
acid amides of formula (VIII)
Pa-(CO-R12)m
in which
Pais a nitrogen containing radical of a synthetic polyamide,R12is a group containing one or two sterically hindered amino groups wherein the amino
nitrogen atoms are incorporated in a cyclic structure, andmis 1 or 2.The compounds of formula (VIII) can be produced by known methods.The compounds of formula (VIII) can be produced when a synthetic polyamide having a
terminal carboxy group or functional derivative thereof (e.g. the acid chloride or an ester) is
reacted during the polycondensation process with one or more amino groups or one or more
sterically hindered amino group containing compounds, preferably of aromatic nature.The compounds of formula R12H which are used for producing the compounds of formula
(VIII) have a reactive nitrogen atom that is either an amino group or part of a cyclic group, for
example a piperazine group. These compounds also contain one or two sterically
hindered nitrogen atoms in a cyclic structure, for example N-C1-4alkyl or N-acyl substituted
2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidyl-4-groups.The preparation of such modified synthetic polyamides having
