<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of sets of hierarchical perceptrons (1i) are disposed in parallel, and each perceptron is configured to execute a 
processing equivalent to a numerical formula corresponding to an input/output relationship by learning. Next, it is configured to 

include a partial differential function of the numerical formula by learning on the basis of the difference between cumulative value 
of the function value output and a teacher pattern and the difference between a partial differential value corresponding to the 

function value output and a partial differential teacher pattern. Thereafter, the outputs of a plurality of sets of hierarchical perceptrons 
(1i) are cumulatively added, and correction is made at the input stages of the hierarchical perceptrons corresponding to 

an unknown numeric quantity on the basis of the difference between the cumulative value and the measurement value and on the 
basis of the partial differential value of the cumulative value. The correction values at the input stages are collected when this difference 

becomes sufficiently small, and an unknown numeric value is estimated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus 
for estimating unknown quantities. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to methods and apparatus 
for estimating unknown quantities under a rule which 
cannot be clearly expressed by numerical formulae or a 
rule which can be expressed by numerical formulae, and 
which requires much labor for actually calculating the 
numerical formulae. From past years, a so called artificial neural 
network is known in which plural neuron devices are 
classified into multiple layers, each neuron device 
belonging to each layer is connected to all neuron 
devices belonging to other layers, and by supplying an 
input pattern to neuron devices belonging to an input 
layer, a predetermined output pattern is output from 
neuron devices belonging to an output layer, the  
 
predetermined output pattern being determined based upon 
coefficient of coupling and threshold value of each 
neuron device. The artificial neural network is called 
as a hierarchical perceptron because the neuron devices 
constitute a hierarchical arrangement in the artificial 
neural network. In the hierarchical perceptron, a so called 
learning is repeated. The learning is performed by 
supplying a known input pattern to a group of neuron 
devices of the input layer and supplying a known output 
pattern corresponding to the known input pattern as a 
teacher pattern, by calculating a difference between the 
teacher pattern and an output pattern output from the 
neuron devices belonging to the output layer based upon 
the input pattern, and by varying the coefficient of 
coupling and the threshold value of each neuron device 
so as to decrease the calculated difference. After 
carrying out sufficient learning, when an arbitrary 
input pattern is supplied to the neuron devices 
belonging to the input layer, an output pattern which 
should correspond to the input pattern is output from 
the neuron devices belonging to the output layer. That 
is, when at least a part of a plurality of input data of 
an input pattern is varied, corresponding unknown 
quantities are obtained as an output pattern.  The hierarchical perceptron is determined its 
kinds and number of an data of input pattern, and when 
output pattern is known which should be output 
corresponding to a known input pattern, after carrying 
out the learning by a necessary number of times using 
these known data, an output pattern corresponding to an 
arbitrary input pattern is obtained. Therefore, the 
learning should be carried out
