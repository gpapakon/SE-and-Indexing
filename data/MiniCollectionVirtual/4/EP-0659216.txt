<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a recombinant vector for the cloning and/or expression and/or transfer of an exogenous nucleotide sequence, said vector being characterized in that it comprises any sequence contained in the fragment C-laI-PvuII comprising the nucleotides 7702 and 1527 of the sequence given in figure (1) and comprising the chain LTR comprised between the nucleotides 7842 and 144, the site PBS starting at the nucleotide 145, the encapsidation sequence comprised in the chain of 250 nucleotides following the end of the LTR sequence, said sequence being capable of controlling the cloning and/or expression and/or tranfer of the exogenous sequence, regardless of its transcriptional orientation with respect to the transcriptional orientation of the virus. The invention also relates to the utilisation of said vector for the transfer and/or cloning and/or expression of genes particularly for a genic therapy.
