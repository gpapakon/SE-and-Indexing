<ABSTRACT>
The wire run-through brake described is suitable for wires having diameters between 1 and 5 mm, a brake-force range of between approximately 2 and 40 kp and wire run-through speeds of up to 7 m/s. The wire (1) runs in a straight line through a gap between two endless brake loops (2, 3) also moved by it in a slip-free manner. These run through in turn between a plurality of pairs of brake heads (8, 9) arranged in series one behind the other, in each case one of the two brake heads (9) being adjustable, preferably pneumatically, relative to the other (8), in order to set the desired brake effect. The endless brake loops are formed by bands.
