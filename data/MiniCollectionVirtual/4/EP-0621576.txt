<ABSTRACT>
A luminescent signboard includes a first light emitter 
and a second light emitter. The first light emitter is 

disposed on a base plate and has a configuration 
corresponding to a predetermined sign. The second light 

emitter is disposed on the base plate at a different 
position from the first light emitter. A sunset sensor is 

provided for detection of sunset. A proximity sensor is 
provide for detection of an object or a person which or who 

has come to a position within a predetermined distance from 
the signboard. A control unit is operable to connect a 

power source to the second light emitter so as to permit 
emission of light therefrom when the sunset sensor detects 

sunset. Further, the control unit is operable to connect 
the power source to the first light emitter so as to 

permit emission of light therefrom when the proximity 
sensor detects an object or a person during detection of 

sunset by the sunset sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a luminescent 
signboard such as a traffic signboard which is operable to 
emit light from a character portion or a frame portion 
surrounding the character portion so as to permit 
recognition of the character portion in the nighttime. There has been proposed a luminescent traffic signboard 
which permits a bicycle rider, a motorcycle rider, an 
automobile driver, or a pedestrian to recognize the sign 
even after sunset. A conventional luminescent traffic signboard includes a 
planar light emitter such as an electroluminescence emitter which is 
mounted on substantially the whole surface of the signboard 
and which is operable to emit light after sunset. A 
character portion including characters such as "STOP" and a 
frame portion surrounding the character portion are drawn on 
a transparent plate such as an acrylic plate superposed on 
the planar light emitter, so that they can be contrasted 
when the light emitter emits light.  With the conventional luminescent traffic signboard, 
although the planar light emitter emits light during sunset, 
its light emitting condition is unchanged, so that it is 
difficult for an automobile driver, a motorcycle rider, a 
bicycle rider, or a pedestrian to distinctly visually 
recognize the characters or sign. It is, accordingly, an object of the present invention 
to provide a luminescent signboard having a luminescent 
display which can be distinctly visually recognized by a 
person such as an automobile driver, a motorcycle rider, a 
bicycle rider or a pedestrian. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
luminescent signboard comprising;
 
   a base plate;
 
   a first light emitter disposed on the base plate and 
having a configuration corresponding to a predetermined 
sign;
 
   a second light emitter disposed on the base plate at a 
different position from the first light emitter;
 
   a sunset sensor operable to detect sunset;
 
   a proximity sensor operable to detect an object or a 
person which or who has come to a position within a  
 
predetermined distance from the signboard;
 
   a power source for supplying power to the first and 
second light emitters, the sunset sensor and the proximity 
sensor; and
 
   a control unit operable to connect the power source to 
the second light emitter so as to permit emission of light 
therefrom when the sunset sensor detects sunset, the 
control unit being operable to connect the power source to 
the first light emitter so as to permit emission of light 
therefrom when
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A luminescent signboard comprising; 
   a base plate; 

   a first light emitting means disposed on said base 
plate and having a configuration corresponding to a 

predetermined sign; 
   a second light emitting means disposed on said base 

plate at a different position from said first light emitting 
means; 

   sunset sensor means operable to detect sunset; 
   proximity sensor means operable to detect an object or 

a person which or who has come to a position within a 
predetermined distance from the signboard; 

   a power source for supplying power to said first and 
second light emitting means, said sunset sensor means and 

said proximity sensor means; and 
   control means operable to connect said power source to 

said second light emitting means so as to permit emission of 
the light therefrom when said sunset sensor means detects 

sunset, said control means being operable to connect said 
power source to said first light emitting means so as to 

permit emission of light therefrom when said proximity 
sensor means detects an object or a person during detection 

of sunset by said sunset sensor means. 
The luminescent signboard as defined in claim 1 wherein 
said first light emitting means includes a planer light 

emitter and wherein said second light emitting means 
includes a flickering light emitter. 
The luminescent signboard as defined in claim 2 wherein 
a plurality of said flickering light emitters are disposed 

along the peripheral portion of said base plate and are 
substantially equally spaced from each other. 
The luminescent signboard as defined in claim 1 wherein 
said power source is a battery chargeable by sunlight. 
The luminescent signboard as defined in claim 1 and 
further including a plate made of weather-resistant 

polycarbonate so as to cover said base plate and said first 
and second light emitting means, and including a high-intensity 

reflection sheet attached to said backing plate 
and having said predetermined sign drawn thereon. 
The luminescent signboard as defined in claim 1 wherein 
said proximity sensor means is sensitive to thermal changes. 
The luminescent signboard as defined in claim 1 wherein 
 

said predetermined sign includes a character portion and a 
frame portion surrounding said character portion.
