<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a method for calibrating and standardising a radiometer for measuring temperatures. Method, characterised in that it consists in setting the radiometric antenna, together with the portion of a thermostating device surrounding the said antenna, in contact with a medium, in particular a liquid medium, at a known temperature, then in taking account of the temperature measured by the said radiometer and, finally, in repeating the two preceding operations at least once by setting the said radiometric antenna and the said portion of the thermostating device in contact with a medium at a different known temperature.
