<ABSTRACT>
A method for the manufacture of silicone rubber 
moldings comprises the preparation of a silicone rubber 

composition by blending an organoperoxide having an 
activation energy of 25 to 41 kcal/mol into a semicurable 

organopolysiloxane composition whose main component is 
organopolysiloxane having organoperoxide-crosslinkable 

functional groups. The silicone rubber composition is 
made into a particulate form and heated at a temperature 

below 100 degrees Centigrade to produce a semicured, 
particulate molding material which retains the activity 

of the organoperoxide and which contains residual 
crosslinkable functional group on the organopolysiloxane. 

Subsequently a mold is filled with the molding material 
and the mold material is completely cured at a 

temperature of at least 100 degrees Centigrade under the 
application of pressure. The method is particularly 

useful for automatic molding methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a highly 
productive method for the manufacture of silicone rubber 
moldings which supports automation of the molding 
process. The present invention further relates to a 
molding material for use in the aforesaid manufacturing 
process. Compression molding is already known as a 
method for the production of silicone rubber moldings. 
In compression molding, the silicone rubber stock is 
suitably cut in a preliminary manual operation into an 
easy-to-handle form which is adapted to the size and 
configuration of the mold. This is then placed within 
the mold and heat and pressure are applied. However, 
considering the process of placement in the mold, not 
only must positioning be performed each time, but this 
positioning becomes difficult when the mold has a 
complicated structure and configuration. This precludes 
molding automation, and improvements in productivity 
cannot be expected. The silicone rubber powder used as an 
ingredient in the method of this invention is disclosed 
in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,742,142; 4,743,760; and 4,749,765. 
The powder and it's methods of manufacture are fully 
explained in these patents. An organopolysiloxane having organoperoxide-crosslinkable 
functional groups is blended with an 
organoperoxide having an activation energy of 25 to 41 
kcal/mol, formed into particulate form at a temperature 
below 100 째C and then semicured. These particles are 
then used to fill a mold and are cured under pressure at 
a temperature of greater than 100 째C.  
 The present invention takes as its object the 
introduction of a method for the manufacture of silicone 
rubber moldings, wherein said method facilitates and 
supports automation of the molding process regardless of 
the configuration and structure of the mold. A further 
object of the present invention is the introduction of a 
molding material for the manufacture of silicone rubber 
moldings which makes possible the implementation of the 
aforesaid production method. According to the present invention's method for 
the manufacture of silicone rubber moldings, a silicone 
rubber composition is prepared by the addition of an 
organoperoxide with an activation energy of 25 to 41 
kcal/mol to a semicurable organopolysiloxane composition 
whose main component is organopolysiloxane which contains 
organoperoxide-crosslinkable function groups. This 
silicone rubber composition is cured into a particulate 
form at a temperature below 100 degrees Centigrade in 
order to manufacture a semicured, particulate
