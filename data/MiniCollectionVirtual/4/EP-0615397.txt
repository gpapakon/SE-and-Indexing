<ABSTRACT>
A noise suppressing circuit in a digital portable telephone 
adjusts a level of signals from a microphone through an analog-to-digital 

converter to suppress ambient noise. An encoder 
produces encoded signals from output signals of the noise 

suppressing circuit. By suppressing ambient noise in a 
transmitting side, the digital portable telephone is capable of 

preventing an awkward feeling to a person in a receiving side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable telephone of a digital mobile communication system.A portable telephone, which permits communication at any
time anywhere, is often used in a place where the ambient noise
is great, such as in a car or train or on a railway platform.
However, the speech encoding system used in digital portable
telephones, because it is an encoding system optimizing speech
signals, involves the problem that ambient noise included in
decoded signals at a receiving side is different from that in
wired telephone. Accordingly, a person using the portable
telephone hears poor quality sound signals which are
uncomfortable to the listener's audio perceptions.From EP-A2-0 288 078 a mobile radiotelephone is known. The
mobile radiotelephone includes a micro-computer,
speakerphone control circuitry and mobile radio. Mobile
radio includes a transmitter, receiver and a duplexer for
coupling the transmitter and receiver to the mobile antenna.
In the transmit voice path, speakerphone control circuitry
includes switch, variable gain amplifier, compressor
amplifier, switch, variable gain amplifier, and two
registers. In the receive voice path, speakerphone control
circuitry includes variable gain amplifier, expander
amplifier, switch, variable gain amplifier, switch and two
registers. Speakerphone control circuitry also includes
rectifier/filter, a companding analog-to-digital (A/D)
converter, two latches, rectifier/filter and two registers.
Microcomputer accesses registers by means of a data bus
including address, control and data lines. Microcomputer
utilizes digital samples from A/D converter to continuously
generate and store in its memory an envelope signal and a
valley signal for the transmit and receive voice paths.JP-A-02 206 246 relates to a voice signal coding device. A
sound detector receives a digital voice signal and uses N
samples of digital voice signals as a frame and
discriminates each frame into a sounding period (sound
frame) and a silent period having no sound (silent frame). A
voice decoder encodes the voice signal inputted from a voice
signal input terminal for the frame or the vicinity of the
frame when the voice signal is discriminated as a sound
frame at the sound detector. A frame discriminated as a
silent frame by the sound detector in the voice signal is
encoded by a silence coder. Thus, when the background noise
of the voice for the sounding period is perceived, the
natural voice is reproduced by sending the characteristic
quantity of the noise even for the silent
