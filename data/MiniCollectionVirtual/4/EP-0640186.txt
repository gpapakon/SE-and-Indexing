<ABSTRACT>
A composite cylinder constructed from a cylindrical liner (12) having an outer surface (18) which is dome shaped adjacent each end. A plurality of layers (30) of resin impregnated carbon filaments are wound on the outer surface (18) of the liner (19) and over the dome shaped portions. Preferably the filaments are helically wound and are wound at an angle with respect to the access of the cylindrical liner (12) such that radial stress as applied during operation will not tend to displace the filaments wound over the dome shaped portions of the liner (12). The composite cylinder is useful as an integral part of a hydraulic actuator used to position flight control surface on aircraft.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fluid 
actuators and more particularly to a composite cylinder 
for use in hydraulic actuators intended for aircraft 
flight controls. Fluid actuators of the type used in flight 
controls for aircraft and other high pressure 
applications are required to withstand high impulse 
pressures without failing over extended periods of time. 
In the prior art, to insure that the actuator had the 
necessary strength, common practice has been to 
construct the actuator cylinder out of a monolithic 
metal piece. Such structure adds considerably to the 
weight of the actuator. To provide actuator cylinders having lighter 
weight than those constructed with a monolithic metal 
piece but at the same time providing adequate strength, 
the use of a composite cylinder has been suggested. 
Typical of such composite cylinders are those disclosed 
in prior art U.S. Patents Nos. 4,685,384, 4,697,499, 
4,802,404, and 4,773,306. The composite cylinders  
 
disclosed in these patents include a metal liner which 
is wound with hoop windings made of a suitable 
composite fiber such as a graphite filament 
impregnated with a suitable resin. The filaments, in 
addition to being hoop wound, have also been helically 
wound, and in some instances, disposed in longitudinal 
winding form. The combination of the hoop, helical 
and longitudinal windings provide the ability for the 
composite cylinder to react to circumferential loads, 
axial loads and compressive loads generated in the 
cylinder during the operation of the hydraulic 
actuator. Although such composite cylinders have 
functioned quite well for the purposes intended, 
difficulties have been experienced in that the 
windings are incapable of supporting the loads 
encountered in all instances. Such difficulties have 
been generated because of the manner of retaining the 
wound filaments on the liner and particularly on the 
metal end glands necessary for receiving end plates 
which in turn receive the piston rods or clevis 
attachment members necessary for proper operation of 
the hydraulic actuator. Other types of composite cylinders are shown 
in European Patent Application EP 0 312 023 A2 and in 
U.S.A. patent No. 4 867 044. These two documents 
disclose a composite type cylinder which includes an 
enlarged portion adjacent the end thereof forming a 
shoulder or dome shaped surface. A reinforcing fiber 
or filament is wound along the pipe and then passes 
around the enlarged shoulder portion and is returned 
in the opposite direction,

<CLAIMS>
A composite cylinder (10) for use in a hydraulic actuator and having a 
cylindrical barrel (12) having a longitudinal axis 

(32), a first outer surface, and first and second ends 
with adjacent dome shaped outer surfaces, a 

plurability of layers of resin impregnated carbon 
filaments wound on said outer surface and said first 

and second domed shaped outer surfaces, at least two 
of said filament layers being helically wound 

said composite cylinder 
characterized in that it includes: 


(A) A first end fitting (24) disposed at 
said first end of said barrel, said 

first end fitting having a second outer 
surface including said first dome 

shaped portion (16) having a first apex 
and a first threaded inner surface (14) 

extending from an outer edge thereof; 
(B) A second end fitting disposed at 
said second end of said barrel, said 

second end fitting having a third outer 
surface including said second dome 

shaped portion having a second apex and 
a second threaded inner surface; 
(C) A major radius (36) defined by the 
distance from said axis to said first 

apex; 
(D) A minor radius (38) defined by the 
distance from said axis to said second 

outer surface of said first end fitting 
adjacent said outer edge thereof; and 
(E) Said helically wound filament 
starting at a point (42) adjacent said 

outer edge at an angle with respect to 
said axis determined by the formula

in Claim 2 wherein said layers of filaments include hoop wound 

layers interspersed between said helically wound layers.  
 
A composite cylinder as defined 
in Claim 3 wherein the angle at which each said helically 

wound filament layer is wound decreases as said layer is 
displaced further from said axis.
