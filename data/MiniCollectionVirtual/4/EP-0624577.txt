<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 
1,3,5,-triazine carbamates, at least biscarbamate functional 
1,3,5-triazine as well as use of 1,3,5,-triazine carbamates. Various derivatives of amino-1,3,5-triazines are described in 
the literature as being utilized in a wide variety of fields. 
An important use of certain of these derivatives, such as the 
methoxymethyl derivatives of melamine and guanamines, is as 
crosslinkers and/or reactive modifiers in curable 
compositions based upon active hydrogen groups-containing 
resins. While these methoxymethyl derivatives provide 
excellent results in a number of aspects, one disadvantage to 
their use is that, under curing conditions, formaldehyde is 
released as a volatile by-product. It has, therefore, been a 
desire of industry to find an acceptable alternative for 
these well-known amino-1,3,5-triazine derivatives which do 
not emit formaldehyde upon cure. One such alternative which has shown great promise is the 
carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines which are disclosed in 
commonly owned US 4,939,213, US 5,084,541, EP-A-0,565,774. Specifically, the carbamate functional 1,3,5-triazines 
disclosed in these references have been found to be 
particularly useful as crosslinkers in coating compositions 
based upon hydroxy functional resins, with the cured coatings 
possessing a wide range of desirable film and resistance 
properties. One hinderance to the commercial use of these carbamate 
functional 1,3,5-triazines has been that the known  
 
preparation methods can be somewhat cumbersome, difficult and 
expensive. For example, in previously mentioned US 4,939,213 
and US 5,084,541, the 1,3,5-triazine carbamates are produced 
in a two-step process by first reacting an amino-1,3,5-triazine 
with oxalyl chloride to produce an isocyanate 
functional intermediate, then reacting this intermediate with 
an alcohol. The primary disadvantages to this process 
include the use of a halogenated starting material, the 
handling of an isocyanate functional intermediate, the 
production of halogenated by-products and the low ultimate 
yield of the desired carbamate functional product. It should be noted that it is generically known to obtain 
carbamates via the reaction of amines with carbonates. It 
is, however, well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art 
that the amine functionality of amino-1,3,5-triazines (such 
as the amine functionality of melamines and guanamines) is 
not equivalent to the other types of typical amine 
functionality. Indeed,
