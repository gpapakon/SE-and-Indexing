<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of the copending 
application having U. S. Serial No. 07/830,811, filed February 4, 
1992 in the names of Arthur Wong, Larry N. Mackey, James J. 
Franxman and John B. Burchnall. The present invention relates to the preparation of nonwoven, 
preferably non-durable, e.g., paper, wiping articles which are 
useful for cleaning up both solid and liquid spills and soil from 
hard surfaces in connection with household cleaning operations. 
Such wiping articles have a mildly abrasive character imparted to 
at least one surface thereof by affixing thereto a certain type 
and amount of polymeric scrubbing bead particles. Nonwoven webs or sheets such as those made of paper find 
extensive use in modern society in the context of household 
cleaning activity. Paper towels, for example, are a staple item 
of commerce which have long been used to wipe up liquid spills and 
to remove stains and/or soil from hard surfaces such as window 
glass, countertops, sinks, porcelain and metal fixtures, walls and 
the like, and from other surfaces such as carpeting or furniture. Paper towels products which are especially useful for 
household cleaning have attributes which include relatively low 
density, high bulk, acceptable softness, high absorbency for both 
aqueous and nonaqueous liquids and acceptable strength and 
integrity, especially when wet. Prior art towel products having 
such attributes, and processes for their preparation, have been  
 
disclosed, for example, in Ayers, U.S. Patent 3,905,863, Issued 
September 16, 1975; Ayers, U.S. Patent 3,974,025, Issued August 
10, 1976; Trokhan, U.S. Patent 4,191,609, Issued March 4, 1980; 
Wells and Hensler, U.S. Patent 4,440,597, Issued April 3, 1984; 
Trokhan, U.S. Patent 4,529,840, Issued July 16, 1985; and Trokhan, 
U.S. Patent 4,637,859, Issued January 20, 1987. Paper towels, such as those of the types described in the 
foregoing patents, are especially useful for absorbing and wiping 
up liquid spills from both hard surfaces and other surfaces such 
as furniture and carpets. Paper towel products, however, are also 
frequently used, generally in combination with liquid cleaning 
solutions or solvents, to remove soil or stains from surfaces to 
which such soil or stains may be especially securely affixed. 
Such soil or stains, for example, may include food material which 
has been baked on to stove, oven, or cooking utensil surfaces, 
soap scum found in bathtubs and sinks, ink or crayon markings on 
walls and furniture, and the
