<ABSTRACT>
A hard thin film having fine crystalline ceramic particles 

dispersed in a metallic matrix phase is disclosed. The 
production of the film is effected by first depositing a 

substantially amorphous film on a substrate and then heat-treating 
the deposited film. Deposition of the film on the 

substrate is carried out by using a source of evaporation having 
a composition represented by the general formula: Al
a
M
b
, wherein 
M stands for at least one element selected from the group 

consisting of Ti, Ta, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, W, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, 
and Cu and "a" and "b" respectively stand for atomic % in the 

ranges of 60 ≦ a ≦98.5 and 1.5 ≦ b ≦ 40, providing 

a + b = 100 
 
. 

Deposition is effected by a physical vapor deposition process in 
an atmosphere of an inert gas containing a reaction gas while 

controlling the feed rate of the reaction gas into a chamber in 
such a manner that the partial pressure of the reaction gas is 

kept constant or varied continuously or stepwise. By this method, 
there can be obtained a hard composite film having fine ceramic 

particles dispersed in a metallic matrix phase or a dense, hard, 
and composite film having a composition and structure obliquely 

varied from a substantially crystalline metallic phase to a 
crystalline ceramic phase in the direction of thickness of the 

film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a highly hard thin film having 
fine crystalline ceramic particles dispersed in a metallic 
matrix phase and a method for the production thereof. More 
particularly, it relates to a hard wear-resistant film which has 
a highly hard ceramic surface, exhibits satisfactory adhesiveness 
to a substrate, excels in resistance to crushing and proves 
useful as high-strength materials, wear-resistant materials, 
and high temperature-resistant materials in a wide variety of 
industrial applications. As wear-resistant coating materials for protecting machine 
parts and tools against wear and scratches, such materials as 
TiN, TiC, WC, and Al-Ti-N alloy have been heretofore used. According to EP-A- 0 588 351, thin 
films of these materials are obtainable by such physical 
vapor deposition processes as the reactive sputtering process 
and the ion plating process and are used as wear-resistant films. 
In order for these films to acquire ample hardness, they are 
required to have their nitrogen content or carbon content 
increased to a certain extent. The increase of the nitrogen 
or carbon content in the film, however, has the possibility of 
inflicting persistent residual stress on the film after the 
treatment. Further, since the crystalline particles of the  
 
columnar structure precipitate in the film depending on the 
conditions adopted for the deposition of film, a fracture 
suffered to occur inside the film possibly exerts an adverse 
effect on the normal part of the film surrounding the fracture 
and thus the film becomes mechanically brittle. Further, the formed film is required to be dense and to 
excel in adhesiveness to a substrate. In general, preparatorily 
to the deposition of a desired hard film on a given substrate, 
the substrate is given such pretreatments as degreasing and 
etching. Then, the desired hard film is directly deposited on 
the freshly pretreated substrate. In the case of the film thus 
deposited, since the physical characteristics of the substrate 
and those of the film differ extremely at times, the adhesiveness 
of the film to the substrate becomes insufficient. To avoid 
this disadvantage, the practice of preheating the substrate and 
then depositing the film on the preheated substrate has been in 
vogue. In spite of these elaborate treatments, the film is 
still at a disadvantage in manifesting a columnar crystalline 
structure which makes the film mechanically brittle. EP-A-0354391 provides a corrosion-resistant and heat-resistant 
aluminum-based alloy
