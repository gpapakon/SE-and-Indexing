A crankshaft bearing for internal-combustion engines, which is provided in a housing -
consisting of a light-metal alloy - of the internal-combustion engine, has a bearing bore

for a journal of a crankshaft and is provided with a device for reducing the increase in the
bearing play during operation of the internal-combustion engine, and the device (25) is

provided between the crankshaft journal (9) and the bearing bore (24) and comprises a
ring-like compensating member (26) surrounding the crankshaft journal (9), 
characterized
in that
 the compensating member consists of a material of which the thermal coefficient
of expansion is greater than that of the adjacent components.
A crankshaft bearing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a bearing shell (27) is
arranged between the compensating member (26) and the crankshaft journal (9).
A crankshaft bearing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the compensating
member (26) consists of plastics material, for example high-strength thermoplastic material.
A crankshaft bearing according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the compensating
member (26) consists of polyamide.
A crankshaft bearing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the compensating
member (26) consists of an anisotropic material, for example thermoplastic material with

a unidirectional fibre reinforcement, having a relatively high degree of thermal insulation
in the radial direction and a relatively low degree of thermal insulation in the axial and

tangential directions.
A crankshaft bearing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the compensating
member (26) consists of zinc or a zinc alloy.
A crankshaft bearing according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the bearing shell (27)
is produced from a metallic material.
A crankshaft bearing according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized
in that
 the thickness (
D
) of the compensating member (26) is dimensioned in such a way
that the bearing play between the crankshaft journal (9) and the device (25) remains constant 

as the operating temperature of the internal-combustion engine increases.
A crankshaft bearing according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized
in that
 the thickness (
D
) of the compensating member (26) is dimensioned in such a way
that the bearing play between the crankshaft journal (9) and the device (25) is reduced as

the operating temperature of the internal-combustion engine increases.
A crankshaft bearing according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized
in that
 the bearing shell (27) and the compensating member (26) form a module (29).
A crankshaft bearing according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the bearing shell (27)
is constructed as a support for the compensating member (26).
A crankshaft bearing according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that
 the bearing shell (27)
is made U-shaped in cross-section and forms a receiving means for the compensating

member (26).
A crankshaft bearing according to Claim 12, 
characterized in that
 the length of the
arms (32, 33) of the bearing shell (27) is dimensioned in such a way thay they are shorter

than an abutment face (39) of the compensating member (26) extending adjacent to the
bearing bore (24).
A crankshaft bearing with a bearing frame comprising parallel walls, according to Claim
12, 
characterized in that
 the arms (32, 33) of the bearing shell (27) are constructed in
such a way thay they engage around the parallel walls (35, 36).
A crankshaft bearing according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized
in that
 the bearing bore (24) is provided with a U-shaped recess (40) for receiving the
compensating member (26).
A crankshaft bearing according to Claim 15, 
characterized in that
 an abutment face (41)
of the compensating member (26) facing the bearing shell (27) projects beyond the bearing

bore (24).
A crankshaft bearing according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized
in that
 a support part (42) is provided between the bearing bore (24) and the compensating
member (26). 
A crankshaft bearing according to Claim 17, 
characterized in that
 the support part (42)
forms a receiving means of U-shaped cross-section for the compensating member (26).
A crankshaft bearing according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized
in that
 the compensating member (26) is joined integrally to the bearing shell (27) by
adhesion, vulcanization or the like.
A crankshaft bearing according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized
in that
 the compensating member (26) is joined integrally to the bearing bore (24) by
adhesion, vulcanization or the like.
A crankshaft bearing, comprising a housing portion mounted on a cylinder crankcase and
a bearing cover of a lower part of the crankcase, which, joined together in a median

longitudinal plane of the crankshaft journal, are connected together by bolt fastenings
arranged on both sides of the crankshaft journal and orientated in a cylindrical manner in

the direction of the longitudinal axis, according to one or more of the preceding Claims,


characterized in that
 the device (25) comprises two semicircular shell halves (30, 31)
inserted in the bearing bore (24).
A crankshaft bearing according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized
in that
 the device (25) for crankshaft journals can be used by piston compressors.
