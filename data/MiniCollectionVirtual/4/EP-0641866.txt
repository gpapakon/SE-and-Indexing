<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an alloy sheet for making a 
shadow mask used for color cathode ray tube and method for 
manufacturing thereof, in particular to an alloy sheet containing 
Fe, Ni and Cr having high press-formability and method for 
manufacturing thereof. Recent up-grading trend of color television toward high 
definition TV has employed Fe-Ni alloy containing 34 to 38wt.% 
Ni as the alloy for making a shadow mask to suppress color-phase 
shift. Compared with low carbon steel which has long been used 
as a shadow mask material, conventional Fe-Ni alloy has 
considerably lower thermal expansion coefficient. Accordingly, a 
shadow mask made of conventional Fe-Ni alloy raises no problem 
of color-phase shift coming from the thermal expansion of shadow  
 
mask even when an electron beam heats the shadow mask. Common practice of making the alloy sheet for shadow mask 
includes the following steps. An alloy ingot is prepared by 
continuous casting process or ingot-making process. The alloy 
ingot is subjected to slabbing, hot-rolling, cold-rolling, and 
annealing to produce an alloy sheet. The alloy sheet for making a shadow mask is then processed 
usually in the following steps to form shadow mask. (1) The alloy 
sheet is photo-etched to form passage-holes for the electron beam 
on the alloy sheet for making a shadow mask. The alloy sheet for 
making a shadow mask perforated by etching is hereinafter referred 
to as "flat mask". (2) The flat mask is subjected to annealing. (3) 
The annealed flat mask is pressed into a curved shape of cathode 
ray tube. (4) The press-formed flat mask is assembled to a shadow 
mask which is then subjected to blackening treatment. However, the above mentioned conventional Fe-Ni alloy has 
higher strength and plane anisotropy as mechanical property than 
conventional low carbon steel. Accordingly, alloy sheet for shadow 
mask prepared by the process including first cold-rolling, 
recrystallization annealing and finish cold-rolling, which is annealed 
before press-forming after perforated by etching, develops problems 
such as poor shape-fix ability, cracking on the alloy sheet and 
blurred periphery of the pierced hole during press-forming, which 
is a significant disadvantage of manufacturing a cathode ray tube. In addition, the above described Fe-Ni alloy gathers rust easily,  
 
which reduces production yield druing the manufacturing process 
of shadow mask. The prior art was proposed in JP-A-3-267320 (the term JP-A- 
referred to herein signifies unexamined
