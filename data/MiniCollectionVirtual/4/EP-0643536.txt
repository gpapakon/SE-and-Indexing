<ABSTRACT>
In a television broadcast system comprising an analog video channel scrambled with a control word which is changed from time to time and a sound channel to the NICAM standard scrambled with a control word which is also changed from time to time, different modulation and scrambling circuits equipped with independent time bases being present for the sound and for the video, a single control word generator is used for the sound and for the video and, when this control word is changed for the video (17), one bit or a specific group of bits is incorporated into the following sound data packet (18), indicating that a new control word is available, but the new control word will be used only for a subsequent data packet (19). Applications: scrambled television.
