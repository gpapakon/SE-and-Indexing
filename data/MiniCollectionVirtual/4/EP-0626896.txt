<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to laser work stations
and, more specifically, to a laser work station in which a
workpiece guidance system may be calibrated to reflect the
actual position of the workpiece therein.Laser work stations are now widely employed for cutting
and welding various types of parts. Generally, in the
processing of sheet metal workpieces, the workpiece may be
supported upon a work table and moved by a clamping and
guidance system about the table relative to a laser head at
a fixed work station, or the laser head may be moved
relative to the workpiece by the guidance system. In the
latter type of laser work station, it is desirable to be
able to effect relative movement of the laser head in X, Y,
and Z axes.In some work stations, the workpieces are loaded onto
the workpiece support or work table automatically by robots
or other loading devices, and in others the workpieces are
loaded manually. Some work tables have loaders cooperating
therewith to position the workpiece thereon in a position to
be engaged by the clamping assembly for movement by the
guidance system.In some machining centers, workpieces are initially
processed and moved from a first machine tool such as a
punching or nibbling machine, and the further processing of
the workpiece may require the precise alignment of the
workpiece in the guidance system of the laser work station.
In some installations, the workpiece may be supported on a 
cart or carrier which is moved into the work station, which may be moved within the
work station, and which then may be withdrawn therefrom so as to minimize the
handling within the station. In other installations, the workpiece may be moved into the
work station on a pallet.Published International Patent Specification No. W091/7029 discloses a work
station for cutting size blanks in a web of material having a pattern. The picture to be
cut is subdivided by reference pieces which are spaced apart into intermediate
subsections. The exact position of the outer profile of the first reference piece is
determined and the subsection following the first reference piece is cut out. The
position of the outer profile of the second reference piece is then determined. The
difference between the positions of the outer profiles of the two reference pieces is
determined and a correction value is transmitted to a control device. The following
subsection is then cut out, taking into account the correction value.However, the correction value only takes into account differences occurring in
the X and Y
