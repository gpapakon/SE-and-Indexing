Method for the closed-loop control of a turbine-generator 
arrangement, in which a turbine control element 

(8) is supplied with a first correcting variable (ST) and 
an exciter control element (18) is supplied with a second 

correcting variable (SE), the correcting variables (ST, 
SE) being formed from in each case at least one reference 

value (ΔP, ΔU), characterized in that the first correcting 
variable (ST) for the turbine control element (8) is 

composed of at least two partial correcting variables 
(ST₂, ST₃), one of the two partial correcting variables 

(ST₃) being derived from the reference value (ΔU) for 
forming the second correcting variable (SE) for the 

exciter control element (18). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the correcting variable (SE) for the exciter control 

element (18) is composed of at least two partial correcting 
variables (SE₂, SE₃), one of the two partial correcting 

variables (SE₂) being derived from the reference 
value (ΔP) for forming the first correcting variable (ST) 

for the turbine control element (8). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the first and second correcting variable (ST, SE) 

are in each case composed of three partial correcting 
variables (ST₁ to ST₃; SE₁ to SE₃), one partial correcting 

variable (ST₁; SE₁) in each case being derived from a 
reference value (Δn) formed from a deviation of the 

actual speed (n
i
) from the setpoint speed (n
s
) of the 
turbine (2). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2 when the 
turbine-generator arrangement is coupled to an  

 
interconnected power system, characterized in that the 

first and second correcting variable (ST, SE) are in each 
case composed of three partial correcting variables (ST₁ 

to ST₃; SE₁ to SE₃), one partial correcting variable (ST₁; 
SE₁) in each case being derived from a reference value 

(Δf) formed from a deviation of the generator frequency 
(f
i
) from the power system frequency (f). 
Method according to Claim 4, wherein the 
reference values (Δf, ΔP) formed from a deviation of the 

generator frequency (f
i
) from the power system frequency 
(f
s
) and from a deviation of the actual power (P
i
) from 
the setpoint power (P
s
) of the generator (6) are cross 
coupled. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the reference value (ΔP) for forming the 

first correcting variable (ST) is the deviation of the 
generator power. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the reference value (ΔU) for forming the 

second correcting variable (SE) is the deviation of the 
generator voltage. 
Closed-loop control device for controlling a 
turbine-generator arrangement with a controller (20) 

which is supplied with actual values of the generator 
power (P) and of the generator voltage (U) as input 

variables and which outputs a first correcting variable 
(ST) to a turbine control element (8) and a second 

correcting variable (SE) to an exciter control element 
(18), the correcting variables (SE, ST) being formed from 

in each case at least one reference value (ΔP, ΔU), 
characterized by means (19) for combining at least two 

partial correcting variables (ST₂, ST₃) which, together, 
form the first correcting variable (ST) for the turbine 

control element (8), one partial correcting variable 
(ST₃) being derived from the reference value (ΔU) for 

forming the second correcting variable (SE) for the 
exciter control element (18). 
Closed-loop control device according to Claim 8,  
 

characterized by further means (21) for combining at 
least two partial correcting variables (SE₂, SE₃) which, 

together, form the second correcting variable (SE) for 
the exciter control element (18), one partial correcting 

variable (SE₂) being derived from the reference value 
(ΔP) for forming the correcting variable (ST) for the 

turbine control element (8).
