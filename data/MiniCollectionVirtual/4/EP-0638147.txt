<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing a component (11) with at least one divided bearing surface (20), partly on a bearing cap (18) and partly on the component (13), for rolling elements. In the process, a casting of a material with at least 0.5 wt % carbon is made. The bearing cap (18) is separated by fracture and, at least in the region of the bearing surface (20) the peripheral surface is hardened to a hardness of at least 55 HRC. The invention relates especially to a process for producing a connecting rod with a two-piece big end (15).

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of a component (11) 
having at least one divided bearing surface (20) for 

rolling members, located in part on a bearing cap (18) 
and in part on the rest of the component (13), in which 

method first of all a shaped part is produced from a 
material containing at least 0.5% by weight carbon, 

from which the bearing cap (18) is separated by means 
of fracture separation, and the component is provided 

with a hardness of at least 55 HRC by surface layer 
hardening at least in the region of the bearing surface 

(20). 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the shaped part is produced by means of powder-metallurgical 

processes. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the surface layer hardening is effected before 

the fracture separation of the bearing cap (18) from 
the rest of the component (13). 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the surface layer hardening is effected after 

the fracture separation of the bearing cap (18) from 
the rest of the component (13). 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the bearing surface (20) is 

machined with an accurate fit by mechanical 
microfinishing. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the bearing cap (18) after 

fracture separation is connected detachably to the rest  
 

of the component (13) and the machining and/or the 
surface layer hardening is effected in the assembled 

state. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that at least one initial crack notch 

(17, 24) is provided in the region of the point of 
separation (16) between the bearing cap (18) and the 

rest of the component (13), that after fracture 
separation the initial crack notch (17, 24) is removed 

substantially completely by machining and then the 
surface layer hardening and the mechanical 

microfinishing of the bearing surface (20) is effected. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that at least one initial crack notch 

(17, 24) is provided in the region of the point of 
separation (16) between the bearing cap (18) and the 

rest of the component (13), the depth of which notch is 
less than the hardening depth achieved by the surface 

layer hardening, and that the initial crack notch (17, 
24) is removed substantially completely upon the 

machining and/or the mechanical microfinishing of the 
bearing surface (20). 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the shaped part is made from a 

sintered material containing 0.5 to 1% by weight 
carbon. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the shaped part is made from a 

sintered material containing 0.7% by weight carbon. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the shaped part is produced by 

sinter-forging, with the initial crack notch (24) being  
 

produced before the forging process and being provided 
with a protective layer and being closed substantially 

completely during the forging process. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the surface layer hardening is 

effected by induction hardening. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that a connecting-rod having a divided 

connecting-rod head (15) is produced as the component 
(11). 
A component consisting of a material containing at 
least 0.5% by weight carbon and having at least one 

divided bearing surface (20) for rolling members, 
located in part on a bearing cap (18) and in part on 

the rest of the component (13), which component has a 
hardened surface layer (22) of at least 55 HRC at least 

in the region of the bearing surface (20) and the point 
of separation (16) between the bearing cap (18) and the 

rest of the component (13) has a parting plane (19) 
produced by fracture separation. 
A component according to Claim 14, characterised 
in that the material contains 0.5 to 1% by weight 

carbon. 
A component according to Claim 14 or 15, 
characterised in that the material contains 0.7% by 

weight carbon. 
A component according to one of Claims 14 to 16, 
characterised in that a sintered material is used as 

the material.  
 
A component according to one of Claims 14 to 17, 
characterised in that the component (11) is designed as 

a connecting-rod having a divided connecting-rod head 
(15).
