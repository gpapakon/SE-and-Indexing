<ABSTRACT>
A liquid gas generator for inflatable air bags that protect vehicle passengers in the event of a collision has a housing, a closed liquid gas reaction container (7) arranged in the housing, a cavity (9) arranged in the housing next to the reaction container (7), a firing element (4), and a piercing element (16) movable in the cavity that pierces a wall of the reaction container (7) when the firing element (4) is actuated, allowing the liquid gas combustion gases to escape from the reaction container (7) into the cavity (9) and from there out of the housing into the air-bag. In order to make it easier to open and pierce the reaction container (7) and to generate gas in a controlled and reproducible manner during the whole service life of the liquid gas generator, the piercing element (16) pierces with its whole length the wall of the reaction container (7) and penetrates in its entirety into the reaction container (7).
