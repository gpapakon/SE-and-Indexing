<ABSTRACT>
A stripper device for a punching tool comprises: a gas 
cylinder (5) filled with a gas (7) having a cylinder head 

(27) and a cylinder end (17) attached to a lower end of the 
cylinder head airtightly; and a piston (9) having a punch 

head (11) and a piston rod (15); an axial movement 
restricting member (13, 201) for restricting an axial 

movement of the piston in the gas cylinder filled with the 
gas; and a rotational movement restricting members (31; 

205, 203) for restricting a rotational movement of the 
piston in the cylinder body. A stripping force of the 

stripper device can be obtained by a resilient force 
generated whenever the gas is compressed by the piston 

within the gas cylinder for each punching operation. The 
punch assembly enables plate material of various 

thicknesses to be punched out without generating stripping 
miss. Further, when the stripper device is assembled with 

a punch body (19) as a punch assembly, the assembly length 
of the punch assembly can be adjusted finely by a stroke 

adjusting mechanism composed of a locating pin (41), 
locating holes (43) and thread engagement of the piston 

with the punch body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stripper device for 
a punching tool and a punch assembly using the same 
stripper device. Fig. 1 shows a conventional punch assembly used for a 
punch press. This punch assembly 101 is mainly composed of 
three parts of a punch body 103, a punch guide 105, and a 
compression spring 107. The punch body 103 is formed with 
a punch trunk portion 109, a small-diameter punch head 
mounting portion 111 formed on an upper side of the punch 
trunk portion 109, and a cutting edge portion 113 formed on 
a lower side of the punch trunk portion 109. The punch 
guide 105 is formed into a hollow cylindrical shape, and 
further formed with a flange portion 115 and a punch guide 
hole 117 for guiding the punch trunk portion 109 of the 
punch body 103 in the axial direction thereof. Further, 
the punch guide 105 is formed with a key groove 119 on an 
inner side wall of the punch guide hole 117 so as to extend 
from the flange portion 115 to near the lower end of the 
punch guide 105. A key 121 is attached to the punch trunk portion 109 
so as to be engaged with the key groove 119 formed in the 
punch guide 105. Therefore, the punch trunk portion 109 
fitted to the punch guide hole 117 of the punch guide 105 
is slidably movable only in the axial direction thereof, 
without rotation under the restriction of the engagement of 
the key 121 attached to the punch body 103 with the key 
groove 119 formed in the punch guide 105.  
 The punch head mounting portion 111 of the punch body 
103 projects from the upper end of the punch guide 105. 
The punch mounting portion 111 of the punch body 103 is 
formed with a male thread portion 123 at the upper end 
thereof. A punch head 125 is screwed with this male thread 
portion 123 of the punch body 103 so that the height of the 
punch head 125 can be adjusted. Further, the punch head 
125 is formed with a flange portion 131 and a lower and 
outer conical portion 127. A plurality (two or three) of 
screw holes 133 are formed in the flange portion 131 of the 
punch head 125 at regular intervals of angle. Further, a 
flat annular fastening member 129 is fitted to a lower 
conical portion 127 formed in the punch head 125. Further, a retainer collar 137 is fitted to a tapered 
portion 135 formed between the large-diameter punch trunk 
portion 109 and the small-diameter punch head mounting 
portion 111 of the punch body 103. The retainer collar 137 
is formed with a flange portion 139 at the middle thereof, 
whose outer diameter is roughly equal to that

A punch assembly having a punch guide (33) formed with a 
hollow guide hole (55); a punch body (19) fitted to the 

hollow guide hole of the punch guide and formed with a 
cutting edge (63) at a lower end thereof; and first rotation 

movement restricting members (59,57) for restricting a 
rotational movement of the punch body in the punch guide 

(33), wherein the punch assembly includes a stripper 
device of gas cylinder type comprising: 


a gas cylinder (5) filled with a gas (7) having:
