<ABSTRACT>
An electronic watthour meter is digitally configurable 
to operate as several different types of watthour meters for 

metering electrical energy from a variety of different 
electric utility services. Automatic scali
ng of line input 
currents is provided to scale the voltage input to an analog 

to digital converter over selected ranges such that low 
level and high level input signals are measured in an 

optimum range. A digital signal processor is employed to 
calculate values for metered electrical energy and output 

pulses, each proportional to a quantum of energy flowing in 
the circuit being metered. The processor calculates the 

value of DC offset errors inherent in the various analog 
circuits of the meter and uses that value in the calculation 

of metered electrical energy to compensate for such offset 
errors. The meter employs automatic and manually initiated 

test functions for testing the operation of the processor 
and other critical circuits in the meter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic watthour 
meters and more particularly to techniques and apparatus 
therein for configuring a meter to monitor electrical energy 
consumption on various types of service networks and further 
to such a meter which contains apparatus for improving the 
accuracy of the measurement of electrical energy. It is well known that there are several different types 
of electrical distribution systems or service in common use 
today. These systems provide power to a user facility in 
the form of: 
1. a four wire three phase wye service; 2. a three wire three phase delta; 3. a three wire network; 4. a four wire three phase delta service; 5. a three wire single phase service; and 6. a two wire single phase service.  
Historically the monitoring of electrical energy consumption 
by a load which is connected to these services has been done 
by various types of induction type watthour meters designed 
specifically to be connected to these types of services.  
 
Meters must be configured so as to be properly connected to 
each of the different types of services. Unfortunately, two 
variants of each basic meter type are required, differing 
primarily by their full scale current rating. The so called 
self-contained watthour meter in common use today has a full 
scale current rating of 200 amperes. The second type of 
commonly used meter is called a transformer-rated meter 
(used with external current transformers to scale down their 
large current loads) and has a full scale current rating of 
20 amperes. In the historical development of 
electromechanical or induction type meters, the 
self-contained and transformer-rated meters wound up with 
slightly different watthour constants (watthours per disc 
revolution). Therefore, the two different types of meters 
cannot be provided for in just the scale factor alone of the 
current sensor in the meter which is used to sense the line 
currents. Thus it can be seen that a need exists for a 
watthour meter which can be configured to accommodate the 
various types of distribution systems or electrical 
services. Electronic registers are in common use today with 
induction type watthour meters.
 
 
Typically the induction type watthour meter contains a pulse 
initiator which senses rotation of the meter disc and 
provides pulses proportional to energy consumption to the 
register. These electronic registers are typically used for 
the measurement of kilowatt demand and/or time of use energy 
consumption. In order to accumulate data
