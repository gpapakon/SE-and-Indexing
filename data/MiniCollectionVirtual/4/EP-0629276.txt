<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for heating or cooling of a gaseous or liquid medium, comprising a heat pump circuit having a structure as known per se, with a compressor, condenser (71), throttle means and evaporator (72). Further the apparatus comprises at least one driving device (77, 78) for the flow of the medium, and a distribution chamber (74) adapted to communicate with the condenser and the evaporator as well as with an inlet (75) or outlet (76) for the medium to or from the distribution chamber. This is provided with an adjustable control member (70) for the flow of the medium in the distribution chamber. The condenser (71) and the evaporator (72) form two substantially mutually opposite main confining surfaces (71A; 72A) of the distribution chamber (74). The inlet (75, 76) or outlet (95, 96) of the distribution chamber is directed substantially in parallel to the main confining surfaces (71A, 72A), and the control member is in the form of a pivotable separating damper blade (70) having two oppositely located edge portions (75A, 75B) which in the two extreme positions of the separating damper blade are adapted to substantially directly engage marginal portions of the respective main confining surfaces (71A, 72A).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for the heating
or cooling of a gaseous or liquid medium, comprising a heat
pump circuit having a structure as known per se, with a
compressor or the like, a condenser, throttle means and an
evaporator and further comprising at least one driving
device for the flow of the medium.Heat pumps are well known in connection with air
conditioning and heating of both gases, such as room air
and liquids. As an example reference is made to GB Patent
Publication 2.203.830. US-A-2466383 describes an apparatus
for heating or cooling a fluid, the apparatus comprising a
heat pump circuit including a compressor, a throttle means,
a condenser and an evaporator, the condenser and evaporator
defining generally parallel main confining surfaces of a
distribution chamber, a driving device located outside the
distribution chamber and arranged to cause the fluid to be
driven into or drawn from the distribution chamber, and a
single unitary separating damper blade pivotally mounted
within the distribution chamber, and movable to any
position between and including two extreme positions in
which the ends of the damper blade engage the main
confining surfaces of the distribution chamber.According to this invention an apparatus comprises a
heat pump circuit including a compressor, a throttle means,
a condenser and an evaporator, the condenser and evaporator
defining generally parallel main confining surfaces of a
distribution chamber, the distribution chamber including
two fluid inlets each directed substantially in parallel to
the main confining surfaces of the distribution chamber, a
driving device located outside the distribution chamber and
arranged to cause the fluid to be driven into or drawn from
the distribution chamber, and a single, unitary, separating
damper blade pivotally mounted within the distribution
chamber, and movable to any position between and including
two extreme positions in which the ends of the damper blade
engage the main confining surfaces of the distribution
chamber, arranged such that the driving device drives fluid
into the distribution chamber through the fluid inlets,
generally in parallel to the main confining surfaces of the
distribution chamber, the fluid being mixed in the
distribution chamber and being discharged from the 
distribution chamber through the condenser and evaporator
depending upon the angular position of the damper blade.The present invention is the result of development
work based on the heat pump principle and is primarily
directed to room

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for heating or cooling a fluid, the
apparatus comprising a heat pump circuit including a

compressor, a throttle means, a condenser (1, 11, 41, 71)
and an evaporator (2, 12, 42, 72), the condenser (1, 11,

41, 71) and evaporator (2, 12, 42, 72) defining generally
parallel main confining surfaces of a distribution chamber,

the distribution chamber including two fluid inlets (5, 6;
15, 16; 75, 76) each directed substantially in parallel to

the main confining surfaces of the distribution chamber, a
driving device (7, 8; 17, 18; 47, 48; 77, 78) located

outside the distribution chamber and arranged to cause the
fluid to be driven into or drawn from the distribution

chamber, and a single, unitary, separating damper blade
(10, 40, 70) pivotally mounted within the 
distribution
chamber, and movable to any position between and including

two extreme positions in which the ends of the damper blade
(10, 40, 70) engage the main confining surfaces of the

distribution chamber, arranged such that the driving device
( 7, 8;17, 18; 47, 48; 77, 78) drives fluid into the

distribution chamber through the fluid inlets (5, 6; 15,
16; 75, 76), generally in parallel to the main confining

surfaces of the distribution chamber, the fluid being mixed
in the distribution chamber and being discharged from the

distribution chamber through the condenser (1, 11, 41, 71)
and evaporator (2, 12, 42, 72) depending upon the angular

position of the damper blade (10, 40, 70) . 
An apparatus for heating a room apparatus for heating
or cooling a fluid in accordance with claim 1, the

condenser (1, 11, 41, 71) of which is in communication with
the room to be heated and the evaporator (2, 12, 42, 72) of

which communicates with air outside the room to be heated,
the fluid inlets (5, 6; 15, 16; 75, 76) in the distribution

chamber being air inlets, and the driving device (7, 8; 17,
18; 47, 48; 77, 78) is arranged to cause air from inside

and outside the room to flow through their respective air
inlets (5, 6; 15, 16; 75, 76) into the distribution

chamber.
