<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and devices for analyzing waste-water and 
other solutions for trace organic compounds and the like, and, more particularly to a reversed 
permeation membrane (RPM) extraction system for concentration and subsequent 
determination of trace organics in sample solutions. With the ever increasing environmental consciousness of the world, the presence 
of trace organics in water, waste-water, and other effluents has also become increasingly 
important. Because some of these substances have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic and 
teratogenic properties, their presence, and particularly their concentrations, have increasingly 
become the focus of both environmental and health scrutiny. Particularly, the allowable 
concentration of a wide variety of potentially toxic compounds in waste-water is extremely 
low, as many have significant adverse effects and toxic activity, even when present in only trace 
levels of concentration (e.g., several parts per billion, or parts per trillion). Continuing studies have been directed toward testing for, controlling, and 
determining permissible levels of a wide range of potentially toxic compounds, and much 
research has consequently gone into developing improved devices and procedures for testing 
for the presence of these various compounds. Among these adopted methods are 
chromatographic techniques, combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry 
techniques (GC/MS), and others. In addition to each of the various classes of compounds having 
their own specific analytical procedure for sampling, storing, collecting, and analyzing, it is 
widely understood in the industry that the existing methods of analysis are often labor 
intensive, equipment intensive, time consuming, and, as a result, costly. It is not unusual for an 
analysis of waste-water to take two days or more for results to be obtained. Many of these 
processes also require the collection of a relatively large sample volume (e.g., 1 liter), utilize 
relatively extensive amounts of laboratory glassware, tubing, and the like, require a relatively 
large volume of solvent for extraction and cleaning of the glassware and apparatus, and/or 
require significant energy input to evaporate the solvent and concentrate the sample 
compounds. In general, compounds of interest have been extracted from waste-water for 
identification and quantification by passing a relatively large volume of the waste-water 
through a bed of granulated charcoal. U.S. Patent 3,967,928 (Schmidt et al.)

<CLAIMS>
A reversed permeation membrane assembly (15) for the analysis of one or more 
compounds of interest from a sample solution, said membrane assembly comprising 


a semi-permeable membrane (20) of predetermined thickness and length, 
said membrane having an inner surface and an outer surface; 
a membrane support (17) adjacent said outer surface of said membrane; 
and 
an essentially non-permeable barrier (18) between said outer surface of 
said membrane and said support to prevent permeation of compound
s 
of interest into said membrane support. 
The membrane assembly of claim 1, wherein said semi-permeable 
membrane comprises a substantially tubular conformation through which sample solution may 

be passed. 
The membrane assembly of claim 2, wherein said membrane support also 
comprises a substantially tubular member within which said semi-permeable membrane is 

mounted. 
The membrane assembly of claim 1, further comprising means for 
attaching said assembly to an analytical device such as a liquid chromatograph, gas 

chromatograph, flow injection analysis apparatus, or the like, for in-line analysis of one or 
more compounds collected with said membrane assembly. 
The membrane assembly of claim 1, wherein said membrane support 
comprises a substantially tubular member within which said membrane is supported, said 

support capable of withstanding a pressure of greater than ten atmospheres. 
The membrane assembly of claim 1, wherein said membrane comprises a 
silicone polymer and the support and the barrier comprise a fused silica capillary tube. 
The membrane assembly of claim 1, wherein said membrane support and 
said barrier are the same entity. 
The membrane assembly of claim 1, further including a means for heating 
the support and membrane, the means for heating the support and membrane being coupled 

to the support so that components of interest which have permeated into the membrane can 
be more readily extracted from the membrane by the application of heat to the membrane. 
The membrane assembly of claim 8, wherein the means for heating the 
support and membrane is a metal wire wound around the support and membrane.  

 
A method of analyzing one or more compounds of interest from a sample 
solution, said method comprising the steps of:

membrane having an inner surface and an outer surface, a membrane 
barrier (18) adjacent said outer surface of said membrane, said barrier 

being essentially non permeable to the compounds of interest, and a membrane 
support (17) adjacent said outer surface of said membrane; 
passing a volume of sample solution in contact with the inner surface 
of said membrane such that compounds of interest permeate into said 

membrane; 
passing a volume of extractant fluid in contact with the inner surface of 
said membrane to extract one or more permeated compounds of 

interest from said membrane; and 
analyzing the extracted compounds of interest.

contact with said membrane as a flowing sample of predetermined volume, moving along said 

membrane within said collection cell. 
The method of claim 10, wherein said sample solution is brought into

time to facilitate permeation of said one or more compounds of interest into said membrane. 
The method of claim 10, wherein said sample solution is brought into 
contact with said membrane for compound collection at a first geographic location, and the 

step of passing the extractant solution in contact with said membrane is completed at a second 
geographic location. 
The method of claim 10, wherein said extractant is a gas and the analysis 
step comprises analysis by gas chromatography. 
The method of claim 10, wherein said extractant is a liquid and the analysis 
step comprises analysis by liquid chromatography.
