<ABSTRACT>
Different cutting tools are alternately fitted into a stamping device in order to produce groups having a different number of contact elements (4), and different connections between the contact regions (6) and the connecting regions (9) of the contact elements (4) are thus stamped, and superfluous contacts and connections are cut away. In the case of plug connectors which are partially fitted, this method leads to economical production of different contact element groups and to a reduction in the space requirement on the connection side when installing a plug connector on a printed circuit board.

Method for fabricating, using press-fit technology, 
contact element groups for plug connectors which 

are bent through 90Â°, in which the contact elements (4) 
are formed in a punching device, with a contact region 

(6) at the plugging end and with a connection region (9) 
at the connecting end, said connecting region (9) having 

a press-fit section (10), running at a right angle with 
respect to the plugging direction, and is joined to the 

contact region (6) via connecting elements (8), characterized 
by the following features: 


a) an intermediate region (7) is punched out by means 
of a cutting tool located in the intermediate region (7) 

between the contact regions (6) and the connecting 
elements (8) in the punching device, in such a way that 

individual connections between the contact regions (6) 
and the connecting elements (8) remain, 
b) when a plug connector is partially equipped only 
with a specific number of contact elements (4), in order 

to fabricate groups with a different number of contact 
elements (4), different cutting tools (11, 11a - 11d) are 

respectively alternately fitted into the intermediate 
region (7) in the punching device, 
c) the different connections (12 - 15) are fabricated 
by means of, in each case, one die package (11, 11a - 

11d) formed from a plurality of dies, and 
d) at least the superfluous contact regions and connection 
regions (6, 9) of contact elements (4), which have 

been eliminated owing to the partial equipment, of the 
respective groups are removed by punching using the  

 
respective cutting tool (11, 11a - 11d) simultaneously 

with the fabrication of such different connections (12 - 
15). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the connections (12 - 15) of contact regions (6) of 

specific contact elements (4) are fabricated at the 
connecting end with successive connection regions (9).
