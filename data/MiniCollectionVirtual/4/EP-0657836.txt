<ABSTRACT>
An transponder arrangement (10) for use with tyres (20) is described. 
The arrangement (10) includes an antenna (14) which is mounted about the 

tyre's(20) perimeter. The antenna (14) preferably has a coupling coil (16) at 
one end. A transponder (12) is preferably located close to the coupling coil 

(16) and is preferably loosely coupled to the coupling coil (16). The RF-ID 
efficiency of the arrangement (10) is generally optimized for this type of 

application by the long but narrow antenna solution and by the simple fact 
that coupling an antenna (14) to a transponder (12) amplifies the emission of 

the transponder's signal relative to the noise, thus improving the signal-to-noise 
ratio of the RF-ID system. The degree of coupling between the antenna 

(14) and the transponder (12) is not particularly critical. The antenna (14) 
acts to extend the reading range for the interrogator (24) to be generally, 

radially symmetric about the tyre (20). Other arrangements are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the extension of a planar and/or
vertical reading range in existing interrogator/transponder RF-ID systems
and modification of the shape of the inherent transponder or reader antenna
pattern to better meet specific applications. This invention relates more
specifically to a tyre RF-ID system as defined in the
precharacterizing portion of claim 1.Applications of RF-ID systems have been used within the tyre industry
to identify and monitor tyres within warehouses or in actual operation
mounted to vehicles. Ideally, because the angular position of the tyre is not
known, the reading range by an interrogator would be symmetric about the
circumference of the tyre. Prior art systems might forego this ideal
characteristic symmetry, thereby causing difficulties in obtaining consistent
communications between the interrogator and the transponders. Other prior
art systems such as described in the PCT patent application 90/12474 have
used a loop antenna, but have required an electrical contact between an IC or
other control circuitry and an antenna ,which is routed about the tyre's
circumference. This use presents difficulties in maintaining a hermetic seal 
about the electronic circuitry. Such a system is further more difficult to
manufacture and is less mechanically reliable. Furthermore, the reading
range is reduced in prior art systems having a loop antenna because the loop
connected to the transponder yields a lossy, lower Q-factor antenna. From EP-A-0 505 905 an integrated circuit transponder in a
pneumatic tyre for use in tyre identification is known. The
transponder has a coil antenna of small enclosed area as
compared to the area enclosed by an annular tensile member
comprising a bead of the tyre. The annular tensile member,
during transponder interrogation, acts as the primary
winding of a transformer. The coil antenna is loosely
coupled to the primary winding and is the secondary winding
of the transformer. The coil antenna is substantially planar
in shape, and, when positioned between the innerliner of
the tyre and its carcass ply, the transponder may include a
pressure sensor responsive to tyre inflation pressure. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
tyre RF-ID system to be identified by an interrogator
unit operable to send a wireless RF interrogator signal, said system
comprising:
the features defined in
claim 1.The magnetic coupling eliminates the need for a galvanic contact
between the transponder and the antenna. Further, the
