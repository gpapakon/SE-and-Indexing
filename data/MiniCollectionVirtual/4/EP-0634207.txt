<ABSTRACT>
In order to achieve sufficiently good change in direction and mixing of a fluid medium with a very low space requirement in the flow channel, a combined mixing and deflecting device is provided having a guide arrangement (2, 14) and a flow channel (24) bent at a bending point (26), the guide arrangement (2, 14) being arranged to the flow channel in the region of the bending point (26), the plane (36) of the guide arrangement (2, 14) being virtually parallel to the direction which the flow channel (24) has in the direction of flow of the fluid medium (30) after the bending point (26), and the guide arrangement (2, 14) having through-holes (12) uniformly distributed over the cross-section of the flow channel (24). The invention is suitable with all liquid, gaseous fluid media for deflecting and mixing the fluid medium in a flow channel.

Combined mixing and deflection device for a 
flowing medium (30), having a guide configuration (2, 

14) for deflecting the flowing medium (30) from a main 
flow direction, the guide configuration (2, 14) being 

arranged in a bend region (26) in a flow conduit (24), 
the plane (36) of the guide configuration (2, 14) being 

aligned approximately parallel to the direction of the 
flow conduit (24) in the flow direction of the flowing 

medium (30) downstream of the bend region (26), and the 
guide configuration (2, 14) having openings (12) evenly 

distributed over the cross section of the flow conduit 
(24). 
Combined mixing and deflection device 
according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
obstruction ratio is approximately 0.35 to 0.65, the 

obstruction ratio being defined as the ratio of the 
surface of the openings (12) to the total surface of 

the guide configuration (2, 14). 
Combined mixing and deflection device 
according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
obstruction ratio is approximately 0.5. 
Combined mixing and deflection device 
according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in 
that
 the guide configuration (2, 14) comprises a 
plurality of evenly spaced guide vanes (10a to 10e, 16a 

to 16e) which are essentially disposed in one plane 
(36). 
Combined mixing and deflection device 
according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the guide 
vanes (10a to 10e, 16a to 16e) have a trapezoidal shape 

and are alternately aligned with their narrow and their 
wide edges towards the flow (30) of the flowing medium. 
Combined mixing and deflection device 
according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that
 from 
four to ten guide vanes (10a to 10e, 16a to 16e) are  

 
arranged in the flow conduit (24). 
Combined mixing and deflection device 
according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised by
 an 
orientation in which the plane (36) of the guide 

configuration (2, 14) is aligned approximately in the 
direction of the force of gravity. 
Combined guide and deflection device according 
to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 a 
location (38) for adding a further flowing medium, such 

as ammonia NH
3
 for example, is provided in the flow 
direction of the flowing medium (30) downstream of the 

guide configuration (2, 14). 
Mixing and deflection device according to one 
of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
, in the flow 
direction of the flowing medium (30) upstream of the 

guide configuration (2, 14), a hotter portion (42) of
