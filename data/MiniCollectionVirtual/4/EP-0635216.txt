<ABSTRACT>
A frothing oil-in-water emulsion having excellent heat resistance and good meltability on the tongue, freshness and coolness, 
and a fat composition most suited for the production thereof. The composition is prepared by mixing a lauric fat or a hardened 

oil thereof with a C₁₆₋C₂₄ fatty acid or its ester or a fat rich in glycerides having C₁₆₋C₂₄ fatty acid residues, effecting the 
transesterification of the obtained mixture by the well-known method in the presence of a lipase having a specificity for the 

1- and 3-positions of glycerides, and if necessary conducting extreme hardening by the conventional method, whereby a fat 

composition comprising glycerides having the total number of the carbon atoms of the constituent fatty acid residues of 38 
or less, 42 to 46, and 48 or above, respectively, in amounts of 25-50 %, 25-40 %, and 5-25 %. The emulsion is prepared from 

this composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fat composition 
which has a specific composition, and a whippable oil-in-water 
(o/w) emulsion prepared by using the fat 
composition. A large amount of laurin fats, such as coconut oil 
and palm kernel oil, and their hydrogenated products 
have been used in whippable creams, such as whipping 
cream. Cream prepared by using these fats, alone or 
with natural fresh cream, has been used for example for 
cake icing. Many of them have qualities superior in 
their physical properties to natural fresh cream, such 
as excellent melting properties in the mouth, freshness 
and cold feeling, but there are still various features 
to be improved. A particular problem of whipped creams 
is their poor heat resistance. Especially in summer, 
whipped cream causes deformation and syneresis, when 
used for example to decorate cakes. Laurin fats, 
especially coconut oil, contain only a small amount of 
long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid 
and linoleic acid. Therefore, their heat resistance is 
not significantly improved even when extremely 
hydrogenated. In addition, a method is known for 
enhancing the heat resistance of laurin fats by adding a 
high melting point fraction of liquid oils or extremely 
hydrogenated oils to laurin fats, but it is known that 
this method degrades the melting properties of the cream 
in the mouth. Though attempts have been made to obtain a  
 
margarine hardstock fat by introducing long-chain fatty 
acids to laurin fat (EP 0170431), no attempts have been 
made to improve melting properties in the mouth and heat 
resistance of a whippable cream. The present invention provides a whippable o/w 
emulsion which has good heat resistance and excellent 
melting properties in the mouth. It is believed that excellent melting properties in 
the mouth, freshness and the cold feeling of a whippable 
o/w emulsion prepared by using laurin fats are derived 
from middle-chain fatty acids with 8-12 carbon atoms. 
Hence, the inventors have found that a novel fat 
composition can be prepared by preserving middle-chain 
fatty acids, which occupy more than half of the fatty 
acids especially in their 2-position as they are, and 
introducing a small amount of long-chain fatty acids 
with 16 or more carbon atoms to the fats, and that 
thereby a whippable o/w emulsion, to which are imparted 
excellent melting properties in the mouth and heat 
resistance, can be prepared. Specifically, the present invention relates to a 
fat composition containing 25-60% of
