<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and a device for setting the compression ratio of an internal combustion engine by changing the relative distance between the rotational axis (7a) of the engine crankshaft (7) and the surface of the engine cylinder head (2) which delimits the end of each cylinder (4) in the engine. The process according to the invention is characterized in that the relative displacement between the rotational axis (7a) of the crankshaft (7) and the cylinder head (2) is carried out in such a manner that the rotational axis of the crankshaft is displaced both parallel to a plane containing the longitudinal axis of each of the engine cylinders (4), and perpendicular to said plane. The device according to the invention is characterized in that the crankshaft (7) is mounted for rotation in excentrically placed bearing openings (16) in circular adjustment discs (13), which are rotatably mounted in the bearing openings (19) in the engine block (1). Furthermore, a rotating device (31, 34, 35) is coupled to the adjustment discs (13) for simultaneous rotation thereof relative to the engine block (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for setting the
compression ratio in an internal combustion engine by
changing the relative distance between the axis of
rotation of the engine crankshaft and the engine cylinder
head surface delimiting the end of each cylinder in the
engine, and a device for carrying out said process.Conventional internal combustion engines work with a
fixed compression ratio which is determined by the
dimensions of the engine components. In order to change
the compression ratio, the engine must be disassembled
and components with other dimensions must be built into
the engine, for example pistons of another height or a
cylinder head with another design of the combustion
chamber. This means that the compression ratio cannot be
changed simply.In certain cases, there is a need to change the engine
compression ratio to adapt it to fuels of varying
qualities, and different proposal have been made to
achieve this. FR-A-813 503 shows how a cylinder can be tilted around a fixed shaft which, however, only provides the
possibility of a relatively small change in the compression
ratio.The purpose of the present invention is to provide a
device which makes possible a great change in the compression
ratio in an internal combustion engine, so that
the compression ratio can, for example, be changed within
the range 4-40, during operation. This means that the
compression ratio can be changed depending on the current
engine operating conditions, so that the engine
efficiency can be improved, especially under partial
load, so that the engine power range can be increased. In 
order to fully exploit these possibilities, the supply of
air and fuel to the engine should also be controlled in
relation to the set compression ratio. For this, suitable
valve systems are required and systems for supplying air
and fuel, but these systems do not constitute any part of
the present invention and therefore will not be described
in more detail here.The purpose stated above is achieved by means of a
process and a device of the type described by way of
introduction which, according to the invention, is
characterized by the features disclosed in the
characterizing clause of Claim 1, while the device
according to the invention is characterized by the
features disclosed in the characterizing clause of
Claim 3 or 5. According to the invention, rotation of the
adjustment discs displaces the rotational axis of the
crankshaft in two dimensions, namely, on one hand,
parallel to the longitudinal axis of each engine
cylinder,
