<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for dispensing a cryogenic liquid includes means for focusing 
(8) a beam of energy, eg. laser energy from a source (16) onto the liquid 

cryogen as it passes through an outlet (4) from a cryogenic liquid 
container (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of and apparatus for dispensing 
cryogenic fluids. Liquid cryogens are used in a number of industrial processes. For example, 
liquid nitrogen droplet dispensers are currently used to provide an inert 
head space when packaging oxygen sensitive products such as coffee and 
peanuts. Liquid nitrogen dispensers are also used in the packaging of 
carbonated beers and soft drinks in cans to provide both an inert head 
space and for increasing the rigidity of the cans. Each application of a liquid cryogen usually requires a particular droplet 
size and, when installed on a production line, for example, a canning line, 
it is important that the size of the droplet being dispensed is constant 
since a varying droplet size will lead to a great variation in can 
pressure. European Patent Publication No. 0331287 discloses an apparatus for 
dispensing a cryogenic liquid which includes a reservoir having an 
electrically heated dispensing tube connected to the bottom of the 
reservoir. Liquid cryogen contained within the reservoir is metered by an 
electrically controlled solenoid valve which, when activated, closes off 
the dispensing tube. The dispensing tube is electrically heated so that 
liquid cryogen within the dispensing tube undergoes film boiling. The film 
boiled liquid cryogen within the dispensing tube acts to lubricate slugs of 
liquid cryogen that are dispensed from the dispensing tube when the 
solenoid valve is raised. Cryogenic liquid dispensers incorporating a solenoid valve and a heater are 
relatively cumbersome and expensive. Furthermore, they cannot achieve the 
mass flow and dosing rates often required by industry. It is an aim of the present invention to provide an apparatus for 
dispensing a liquid cryogen which does not incorporate a separate solenoid 
valve and heater.  Accordingly to one aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for 
dispensing a cryogenic liquid comprises a vessel for containing the liquid 
cryogen, an outlet from the vessel for the passage therethrough of the 
liquid cryogen and means for focusing a beam of energy on the liquid 
cryogen as it passes through the outlet. The beam of energy may be a beam of laser light emanating, for example, 
from a COâ‚‚ laser. Alternatively, it may be a beam of microwaves or a beam 
of ultrasonic waves. Preferably, the outlet comprises a passage and the focusing means is 
arranged to focus the beam of energy immediately adjacent the distal end of 
the passage. According to a further aspect of

end of the passage. 
A method of dispensing a cryogenic liquid characterised by the steps 
of allowing the cryogenic liquid to flow along a predetermined path 

and focusing a beam of energy at the cryogenic liquid as it flows 
along the path so that the cryogenic liquid undergoes a localised 

vaporisation.

energy is applied intermittently to the cryogenic liquid thereby to 

create discreet droplets of liquid cryogen along said path.
