<ABSTRACT>
An electrical contact device for a motor-vehicle lamp cap includes a springy conducting blade (1) in contact with a conducting contact terminal (2) located on a cap (3) of a bulb. According to the invention, the conducting blade (1) includes, in the region of the contact terminal (2), a hollowed contact area (6) partly receiving the terminal and ensuring electrical contact and holding of the terminal in the lateral direction by at least two edge regions of the terminal which are remote from each other, there being no contact in the central region of the said terminal.

<CLAIMS>
An electric contact device for a lamp base for a vehicle, 
in particular a motor vehicle, comprising an elastic 

conductive blade (1) in contact with a conductive contact 
block (2) situated on a base (3) of a bulb,
characterised in that
 the conductive blade (1) comprises 
at the level of the contact block (2) a hollow contact 

zone partially receiving the block and ensuring a non-surface 
electrical contact and a retention of the block 

in the lateral direction by at least two edge regions of 
the block distant from one another, no contact occurring 

in the central region of the said block. 
A contact device according to Claim 1, for a lamp having 
bayonet-type assembly means,
characterised in that
 the hollow contact zone (5) has a 
hollow profiled shape, the longitudinal direction of 

which is essentially parallel to an axis passing through 
two pins (4) of the said assembly means. 
A contact device according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the transversal width of the 
profiled contact zone (5) is less than the width of the 

block in the same direction. 
A contact device according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that
 the profiled contact zone (5) has 
a section in a general "V" shape. 
A contact device according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that
 the profiled contact zone has a 
section in a general shape of an arc of a circle.  

 
A contact device according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 the radius of curvature of the 
profiled contact zone is less than a minimum radius 

of curvature of the block. 
A contact device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the hollow contact zone (6) 
has the shape of a recess having a generally 

circular circumference. 
A contact device according to Claim 7,
characterised in that
 the recess (6) has a spherical 
shape, with a radius of curvature less than a 

minimum radius of curvature of the contact block 
(2). 
A contact device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the hollow contact zone is 
defined by an orifice (7) of a smaller size than 

that of the contact block (2). 
A contact device according to Claim 9,
characterised in that
 the said orifice (7) is 
circular and has fallen edges. 
A lamp holder for a motor vehicle, defining at least 
one lamp socket,
characterised in that
 the or each socket is equipped 
with a contact device according to any one of Claims 

1 to 10. 
A signal lamp for an industrial motor vehicle,
characterised in that
 it is equipped with a lamp 
holder according to Claim 11.
