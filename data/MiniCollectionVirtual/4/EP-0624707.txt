<ABSTRACT>
A drag bit for soft, sticky formations has new fluid dynamics control 
mechanism that minimizes "bit-balling". Multiple radially extending 

blades (50) 
carrying PDC cutters (54) have tapered back sides (62) to achieve 

greater velocity through 
the fluid channels (52). Multiple jet nozzles (58) in each fluid channel 

(52) create interacting 
vortices that produce extremely turbulent flow thereby minimizing the 

coagulation and deposition of hydrated clay cuttings on the bit cutting 
surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to diamond drag bits. More particularly, this
invention relates to polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) drag bits for drilling
soft, sticky clay and shale earthen formations.Earthen formations, such as bentonitic shales and other hydratable clays,
that are plastic and sticky, are very difficult to drill because the drilled cuttings
tend to coagulate and adhere to or "ball-up" the cutting face of the drill bit.
When a bit is balled up, fine particles pack into the spaces between cutting
elements and, in effect, prevent the cutting elements from effectively engaging
the bottom of the hole being drilled. This drastically reduces the drilling rate and
bit life.Roller cone drill bits and tungsten carbide "fish-tail" drag type drill bits
have had limited success when attempting to drill these formations with water
base muds. Both bit types ball-up very easily, severely slowing or stopping the
drilling rate. This results in having to make numerous costly round trips of the
drill string out of the hole to change bits.Natural diamond drill bits also have had limited success drilling these
sticky formations because they are very easily balled-up due to the extremely
small protrusion of the diamond cutting elements.PDC type drag bits in present use are very effective drilling soft,
hydratable shales and clays when using oil base drilling mud, but severely ball-up
when using water base drilling muds which hydrate the formations which made
them sticky.State of the art PDC drill bits for drilling soft formations are multiple
bladed with PDC cutters affixed to the outer surfaces of the blades, see for example US-A-4,872,520. The
aforesaid blades have a leading side and a trailing side which are essentially
vertical and parallel to the bit axis. A single nozzle is positioned in relatively 
close proximity to the bit center and in the center of a fluid channel formed by
two of the blades. The drilling fluid exiting the nozzle naturally flows radially at
high velocity to the outer diameter of the bit close to the center line of the fluid
channel. This creates low fluid pressure areas proximate the leading and trailing
sides of adjacent blades, thereby inducing reverse flow of drilling fluid and
entrained hydrated drill cuttings close to the blades. The hydrated drill cuttings
now have an affinity for the metal bit head surface because of their electrical
charge, therefore they aggregate and adhere to the bit head surface behind the
trailing side of the aforesaid preceding blade. The

<CLAIMS>
1. A drag type drilling bit comprising:

a bit body (42) having a first pin end (44) and a second cutting end (46), the pin end
being open to a source of drilling fluid that is transmitted through an attachable

drill string, the open pin end communicating with a fluid plenum formed by the
bit body;
two or more radially extending raised blades (50) on the second cutting end (46);
a multiplicity of cutting elements (54) strategically mounted on each of the
blades (50);
drilling fluid channels (52) between the blades (50), the fluid channels originating
proximate an axis of the drilling bit and terminating at the bit outer diameter; and

characterized by

each of the blades having a first leading side (60) and a second tapered trailing
side (62) which tapers from the crest of each raised blade (50) substantially to the root of

a next following raised blade (50); and
two or more fluid discharge ports (58) communicating with the fluid plenum
and exiting into each of the fluid channels (52) in close proximity to the first leading

side (60), the vortices created by the drilling fluid exiting the discharge ports in each
fluid channel and arranged to interact to produce a highly turbulent radial flow

to clean and cool the bit cutting end and the cutting elements.
A drilling bit as recited in claim 1 wherein the first leading side (60) of
the blade (50) is substantially parallel with an axis formed by the bit body.
A drilling bit as recited in either of claims 1 or 2 wherein the two
or more fluid discharge ports (58) are proximate to and substantially parallel with the

first leading side (60) of the raised cutter blades (50).
A drilling bit as recited in any one of the preceding claims wherein
the discharge port (58) retains a removable nozzle, the nozzle forming a nozzle

opening for adapting to the particular fluid flow conditions at a borehole drilling
site.
A drilling bit as recited in any one of the preceding claims wherein
the bit comprises four radially extending raised cutting blades (50). 
A drilling bit as recited in any one of the preceding claims wherein
the drag bit body (42) is fabricated from a matrix of tungsten carbide.
