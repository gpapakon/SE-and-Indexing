<ABSTRACT>
A method for in situ remediation of subsurface soil or groundwater contaminated by chlorinated hydrocarbons. A nutrient fluid is selected to stimulate the growth and reproduction of indigenous subsurface microorganisms capable of aerobically degrading the contaminants, and an oxygenated fluid is selected to create an aerobic environment for the microorganisms. The nutrient fluid is injected periodically and the oxygenated fluid is injected continuously through a well (26) in such a way as to draw the fluids through the plume (14). Treatment is continued until the concentration of contaminants is reduced to an acceptable level. For example, the nutrient fluid can be methane and the oxygenated fluid can be air to stimulate the production of methanotrophs to break down chlorohydrocarbons, such as trichloroethylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for in situ
bioremediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. In particular,
the invention relates to remediation of contaminated soil and
groundwater by the injection of nutrients to stimulate growth of
pollutant-degrading microorganisms. The United States Government
has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. DE-AC09-89SR18035
between the U.S. Department of Energy and Westinghouse
Savannah River Company.Manufacture, transportation, and use of chlorinated
hydrocarbons often results in accidental releases of these pollutants
that contaminate subsurface soils and groundwater. Such
contamination damages the local ecosystem, posing serious potential
health problems if local groundwater is used as a source of drinking
water or irrigation water, or if the soil is used for growing crops.
Adjacent ecosystems may be affected if the contaminants migrate from
the site with the flow of groundwater. Contamination of groundwater
by organic compounds is recognized as one of the most important
pollution problems of the industrialized nations. For example, it is
estimated that over 15% of community drinking water supplies in the 
United States are currently contaminated with chlorinated
hydrocarbons. As reliance on groundwater for drinking water,
irrigation, and industrial uses increases, the problem will assume
increasing urgency.Soil can be treated by excavating the contaminated subsurface
materials such as soils, sediments, fractured rock, and the like. The
excavated materials are treated to remove the contaminants or simply
stored elsewhere. Groundwater may be removed along with excavated
soil or be pumped to the surface of the earth for treatment. These
direct methods of dealing with contaminated groundwater are
relatively expensive.Other methods are available for treating contaminated sites in
situ. A horizontal well system for treatment of contaminated
groundwater is described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No.
4,832,122 issued to Corey, et al. This system comprises two sets of
wells, an injection well for injecting a fluid into a saturated zone on
one side of or within a plume of contaminants and an extraction well
for collecting the fluid together with volatilized contaminants from the
plume on the other side of, above or within the plume.A number of techniques for treating contaminated groundwater
involve pumping the water above ground for filtration and treatment.

A method for enhancing the degradation of contaminants in the soil, said
soil containing microbes capable of degrading said contaminants aerobically, said

method comprising the steps of:

injecting of a mixture of a nutrient fluid and an oxygenated fluid into said
soil for a first period of time to feed said microbes so that said microbes grow and

reproduce; then
injecting said oxygenated fluid into said soil without said nutrient fluid
whereby said microbes will degrade said contaminants under aerobic conditions;

and
repeating the injecting steps until said contaminants are degraded to a
preselected level.
The method as recited in claim 1, wherein said contaminants are
chlorinated hydrocarbons, said microbes are methanotrophs, and said nutrient fluid

is methane. 
The method as recited in claim 1, wherein said oxygenated fluid is air and
said nutrient fluid is methane.
The method as recited in claim 1, wherein said oxygenated fluid is selected
from the group consisting essentially of air, pure oxygen, an oxygen and nitrogen

mixture, water vapor and steam.
The method as recited in claim 1, wherein said oxygenated fluid is air and
said nutrient is methane and said methane comprises not more than 5 volume

percent of said mixture.
The method as recited in claim 1, further comprising the step of
monitoring said contaminants, said contaminants being characterized in terms of a

contaminant concentration, and wherein said preselected level is less than 5 ppb.
