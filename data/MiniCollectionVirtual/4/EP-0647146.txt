<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a retractable needle system for use with a medical device, having a substantially cylindrical barrel comprising: a needle support means (1) for mounting a needle at the front end of said cylindrical barrel (3) which comprises a well (12) having a bottom and sides and an exterior surface and an interior surface (14), said exterior surface (13) being conformed so as to reversibly seal said needle support means to the front end of said cylindrical barrel (3), and a retractor (2) which comprises a shank portion, said retractor (2) having a front end (20) which is configured so as to irreversibly engage the interior surface (14) of the well (12) of said needle support means (1) when advanced to the front end of said cylindrical barrel (3), and to thereby retract said needle support means (1) into said cylindrical barrel (3) when the retractor (2) is withdrawn toward the back end of the cylindrical barrel (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
 RETRACTABLE NEEDLE SYSTEMRelated Application DateThis application is a continuation-in-part of commonly-owned and co-pending application serial no. 07/903,617 filed June 24, 1992.Technical FieldThe present invention relates to hypodermic needles which can be retracted into a medical instrument, such as the barrel of a syringe, or of a VACUTAINER cup holder, after use.Background of the InventionHypodermic needles are common instruments utilized daily in the practice of medicine. Such needles find use primarily in conjunction with associated medical instruments, e.g., syringes, blood collection devices, intravenous tubing and the like. Disposable needles are among the most frequently used hypodermic needles. After use, the needle is often subject to further handling before disposal. There is an ongoing concern among medical personnel to prevent the spread of infectious diseases by avoiding contact with contaminated needles before they are discarded. Although medical personnel are generally well informed of the dangers and diligent in following proper disposal procedures, the stress of providing medical care in emergency cases inevitably causes occasional mishaps.Therefore, it is presently considered desirable to provide a hypodermic needle which can be quickly and 

easily sequestered after use to prevent unintended contact. One approach is to provide a hypodermic needle which can readily be withdrawn into the associated medical instrument after use. U.S. patents 4,969,877 and 5,098,390 disclose syringes with retractable needles. However, these designs are specialized and complex. They are expensive to manufacture and do not lend themselves to application to standard medical instruments.Disclosure of the InventionThe present invention provides a retractable needle system for use with associated medical devices that is simple to manufacture, compatible with standard medical devices, and easy to use. The retractable needle system is designed to retract a hypodermic needle into the cylindrical barrel of a device such as a syringe or blood sampling device, and comprises a needle support means and a retractor means. The needle support means has a shape designed to conform to the forward end of the cylindrical barrel and has a means for mounting a needle and a well that has an exterior surface configured to provide sealing engagement with the interior forward surface of an associated medical instrument and an interior surface configured to provide a sealing engagement with the retractor. The retractor is

 CLAIMS
1. A retractable needle system for use with a medical device, said medical device having a substantially cylindrical barrel with a front end and back end, which retractable needle system comprises: a needle support means for mounting a needle at the front end of said cylindrical barrel which comprises a well having a bottom and sides and an exterior surface and an interior surface, said exterior surface being conformed so as to reversibly seal said needle support means to the front end of said cylindrical barrel and a means for mounting said needle in said needle support means so as to project from said cylindrical barrel, being in fluid communication therewith, and a retractor which comprises a shank portion which is capable of traversing between the front end and back end of said cylindrical barrel, said retractor having a front end which is configured so as to irreversibly engage the interior surface of the well of said needle support means when advanced to the front end of said cylindrical barrel, and to thereby retract said needle support .'
:
:Î¹eans into said cylindrical barrel when the retractor is withdrawn toward the back end of the cylindrical barrel.
2. The retractable needle system of claim l which further contains a hypodermic needle mounted in said needle mounting means.
3. The retractable needle system of claim l wherein the sides of said well further comprise a first annular ridge at the interior surface of said well; and 


 wherein the retractor further contains at the front end thereof a second annular ridge, wherein said first annular ridge is sufficiently spaced from the bottom interior surface of said well to permit insertion of the second annular ridge between said bottom interior surface and said first annular ridge and said first and second annular ridges being of sufficient width to engage with respect to each other when said front end of the retractor is inserted into the well, having sufficient compressibility to permit said insertion but insufficient compressibility to disengage when the retractor is withdrawn.
4. The retractable needle system of claim 1 wherein the sides of the well of the needle support means have a smooth interior surface and the front end of said retractor is sufficiently laterally compressible to permit insertion of said retractor into the well and sufficiently laterally expandable to produce adhesion between said front end of the retractor and the interior surface of the well, so that when the retractor is withdrawn toward the back end of the cylindrical barrel, the front end of the retractor remains engaged with said needle support means, and withdraws said needle support means into the barrel.
5. A hypodermic syringe which comprises a cylindrical barrel having disposed therein a retractable needle system which comprises a needle support means for mounting a needle at the front end of said cylindrical barrel which comprises a well having a bottom and sides and an exterior surface and an interior surface, said exterior surface being conformed so as to reversibly seal said needle support means to the front end of said 


cylindrical barrel and a means for mounting said needle in said needle support means so as to project from said cylindrical barrel, being in fluid communication therewith, and a retractor which comprises a shank portion which is capable of traversing between the front end and back end of said cylindrical barrel, said retractor having a front end which is configured so as to irreversibly engage the interior surface of the well of said needle support means when advanced to the front end of said cylindrical barrel, and to thereby retract said needle support means into said cylindrical barrel when the retractor is withdrawn toward the back end of the cylindrical barrel.
6. A holder for a blood withdrawal which comprises a cylindrical barrel having disposed therein a needle support means for mounting a needle at the front end of said cylindrical barrel which comprises a well having a bottom and sides and an exterior surface and an interior surface, said exterior surface being conformed so as to reversibly seal said needle support means to the front end of said cylindrical barrel and a means for mounting said needle in said needle support means so as to project from said cylindrical barrel, being in fluid communication therewith.
