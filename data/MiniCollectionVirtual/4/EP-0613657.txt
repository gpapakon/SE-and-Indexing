<CLAIMS>
A nail (30) for fastening a cover membrane on a
bone belonging to the body and surrounding a bone

defect filled with bone-constructing material, the
nail having a larger-diameter head (28) for acting

on with a pressure and/or striking tool and an
adjoining smaller-diameter shank (36) comprising a

substantially cylindrical retaining part (38) and an
adjoining substantially conical pointed part (40),


characterised in that
 the transition region between
the retaining part (38) and the pointed part (40)

comprises a larger-diameter annular shoulder (42)
which via a conical surface (46) extends at an angle

to the surface (48) of the pointed part (40) at the
tip of the nail and towards the head (28) has an

annular surface (44) extending substantially at

right angles to the longitudinal axis of the nail
(30) and forming a barb adjoining the retaining part

(38), and the surface of the retaining part (38) has
a bevel (50) which extends into the pressure surface

(32) of the nail head (28) extending substantially
at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the nail

(30), and the nail head (28), at its peripheral edge
adjoining the pressure surface (32), has a

peripheral bevel (52) which rises from the surface
(32) towards the surface (34) of the nail head (28)

remote from the shank (36).
A nail according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the conical surface (46) of the annular
shoulder (42) extends from the outer periphery of 

the annular surface (44) to the surface (48) of the
pointed part (40) without a substantial change in

conicity.
A nail according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the conical surface (46) of the annular
shoulder (42) is at a greater angle to the

longitudinal axis of the nail (30) than the
adjoining region of the surface (48) of the pointed

part (40).
A nail according to claim 3, 
characterised in
that
 the angle between the conical surface (46) of
the annular shoulder (42) and the longitudinal axis

of the nail (30) is about 25Â°.
A nail according to any of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the surface (34) of
the nail head (28) is rounded.
A nail according to any of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the material used for
making it is a titanium alloy or the like.
