<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce an isolation trench in an SOI substrate in which logic components and high-voltage power components are integrated, a trench extending as far as the insulating layer (2) is etched and covered with a doped silicon structure. By diffusion out from the doped silicon structure diffusion regions (11) neighbouring the trench are produced and an insulating structure (9) is produced in the trench by autoxidation of the doped silicon structure.

Process for fabricating an insulation trench in
an SOI substrate in which logic components and hig
h-voltage
power components are integrated,


in which the SOI substrate comprises a monocrystalline
silicon wafer (1), an insulating layer

(2) made of SiO
2
 and arranged on top of the latter,
and a monocrystalline silicon layer (3) arranged

on top of the latter,
in which a trench (6) is etched into the
monocrystalline silicon layer (3) with the aid of

a trench mask (4) and reaches down to the
insulating layer (2),
in which a doped silicon structure (8) is
produced, which covers at least the side walls

(61) of the trench (6),
in which, in order to form the doped silicon
structure (8), a doped silicon layer (7) is

produced with essentially conformal edge covering
with a thickness which is less than half the width

of the trench (6),
in which the doped silicon layer (7) is deposited
in a manner doped in situ,
in which the doped silicon layer (7) is deposited
amorphously,
in which the doped silicon layer (7) is
anisotropically etched selectively with respect to

SiO
2
, with the result that horizontal surfaces of 
the trench mask (4) and of the SiO
2
 layer (2) are
uncovered and that doped silicon spacers (8)

remain on vertical sidewalls of the monocrystalline
silicon layer (3) and of the trench

mask (4), which silicon spacers form the doped
silicon structure (8),
in which diffusion regions (11) adjacent to the
trench (6) are produced by outdiffusion from the

doped silicon structure (8) in the monocrystalline
silicon layer (3),
in which an insulation structure (9) is produced
in the trench (6) by oxidation of the doped

silicon structure (8),
in which the outdiffusion from the doped silicon
structure (8) is performed in an oxidizing

atmosphere, with the result that the oxidation of
the doped silicon structure (8) occurs at the same

time as the outdiffusion.
Process according to Claim 1,

in which the outdiffusion and the oxidation are
performed in a humid atmosphere in the temperature

range of between 900°C and 1200°C.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2,

in which the doped silicon layer (7) is deposited at
from 400°C to 550°C using SiH
4
 or Si
2
H
6
.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

in which the trench mask (4) comprises SiO
2
 at
least at the surface, and


in which the trench (6) is etched selectively with
respect to SiO
2
.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
in which, as a result of the deposition and etching

back of a further silicon layer (12), free space that
has remained within the insulation structure (9) in the

trench (6) is filled with a silicon filling (121).
Process according to Claim 5,

in which the trench mask (4) is formed as a layer
sequence comprising a bottom layer (41) made of 

thermal SiO
2
, a middle layer (42) made of CVD-Si
3
N
4

and a top layer (43) made of CVD-SiO
2
,
in which the etching back of the further silicon
layer (12) is designed in such a way that the

silicon filling (121) terminates below the bottom
layer (41) of the trench mask (4),
in which etching which is selective with respect
to Si
3
N
4
 is carried out, in which the top layer
(43) of the trench mask (4) is removed and in

which the insulation structure (9) is etched back
in the upper region, with the result that it

terminates essentially with the middle layer (42)
of the trench mask (4),
in which the surface of the silicon filling (121)
is oxidized, producing an insulation termination

(13) which completely covers the silicon filling
(121).
Process according to Claim 6,

in which the oxidation for the purpose of forming the
insulation termination (13) is performed in a humid

atmosphere in the temperature range of between 900°C
and 1200°C.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7,

in which free space that has remained within the
insulation structure (9) in the trench (6) is filled

with SiO
2
 in a CVD process using a process gas
containing O
3
 and Si(OC
