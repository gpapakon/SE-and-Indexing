<ABSTRACT>
A method for enhancing the dielectric properties of 
new or in-service electrical cable is disclosed, the method 

comprising supplying the interstitial void space of the 
cable's conductor with a fluid mixture comprising 


(A) an antitreeing agent; and 
(B) a water-reactive compound, 
wherein (B) has a diffusion coefficient of at least 1 x 10⁻⁷ 
cm²/second at 50°C. in the insulation of the cable and the 

mixture has an initial viscosity of ≦100 cP (mPa·s) at 25°C. 
The instant method provides a more symmetrical distribution 

of dielectric enhancing fluid in the insulation than prior 
art approaches and results in a significant reduction in 

cable treatment time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
enhancing the dielectric strength of an electrical 
distribution cable. More particularly, the instant invention 
relates to a method of contacting the interior of the cable 
with a fluid mixture which comprises a liquid antitreeing 
agent and a water-reactive compound, the latter having a 
diffusion coefficient of at least 1 x 10-7 cm2/second at 
50°C. in the polymeric insulation of the cable. A major problem associated with electrical 
distribution cable is its tendency, over a period of time, to 
fail due to the progressive degradation of its insulation. "Water treeing," is observed when the insulation 
material is simultaneously exposed to moisture and an 
electric field. This mechanism is much more gradual than 
electrical treeing, requiring an extended period of time to 
cause the degree of damage that affects the insulation 
characteristics of the distribution cable. However, since 
water treeing occurs at considerably lower electrical fields 
than required for the formation of electrical trees, this 
phenomenon is thought to be a leading cause of reduced 
service life of cables. As a partial answer to industry's 
desire to extend the useful life of existing underground 
cables, it has been found that certain tree retardants can be 
introduced into the cable's interior to partially restore the 
insulation performance. United States Patent No. 5,200,234, assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention, disclosed a method for 
restoration of in-service electrical cable. The cable is 
first positioned within a surrounding conduit and the space 
between the cable and the conduit is then filled with a  
 
homogeneous mixture of a silane antitreeing agent and a 
dielectric oil. The dielectric oil is completely miscible 
with said antitreeing agent and has a solubility in the 
polymeric insulation of the cable of less than 5 weight 
percent. This cable reclamation method is effective but 
typically requires a long exposure time to obtain a fully 
treated cable. As a consequence, a contractor might find it 
economically equivalent, or even advantageous, to completely 
replace a cable once it has deteriorated rather than avail 
himself of this restorative method. Applicants have extensively investigated the 
methods taught by US-A 4,766,011 and US-A 5,200,234 and have 
found them to be limited by a heretofore undisclosed 
phenomenon whereby the use of the suggested restorative 
fluids of these patents results in a highly asymmetric 
treatment of the cable
