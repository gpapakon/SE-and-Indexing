<DESCRIPTION>
NEW ANALGESIC AND NOOTROPIC DRUGSField of the inventionThe present invention refers to a new class of compounds including derivatives of α-phenyl, α-phenoxy, α-phenylthio, α-- phenylamino substituted alkanoic acids, characterized by the presence of a tropanyl group bound to the carboxyl through an ester or amidic linkage.The claimed compounds produce a nootropic effect (i.e. learning facilitation and memory enhancement) as well as an analgesic effect. Therefore, they are suitable for treating cognitive deficits and various types of pain in humans.Prior artCholinergic-mediated central neurotransmission has a number of important functions; in particular, it plays a major role in cognitive processes (learning and memory) and pain central perception. The role of the cholinergic system in cognitive processes is amply documented by scientific literature: it is enough to quote the paper by Bartus et al. in Science 217, 408- 417 (1982). The role of the cholinergic system in antinociception is less documented [Harris et al., J. Pharmac. Exp. Ther. , 169, 17-22 (1969); Bartolini et al.. Br. J. Pharmacol., 92, 711-721 (1987); Bartolini et al. , Br. J. Pharmacol., 105, 77-82 (1992)]. However, this does not mean that the experimental results supporting it are less reliable. 

It would, therefore, be extremely useful to use cholinomimetic drugs capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier both to enhance cognitive processes and to reduce pain. However, the said drugs, though efficacious, have never been used due to their unbearable side effects both of central (tremors, etc.) and peripheral origin (bradycardia, sialorrhoea, diarrhoea, eyesight disorders, etc.).Recent results [Bartolini et al., Br. J. Pharmac, 92, 711*721 (1987); Bartolini et al., TIPS Suppl. IV 9 (1989); Gualtieri et al., TIPS Suppl. IV, 99 (1989); Ghelardini et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 101, 4 -54 (1990)], provided evidence that the functioning of the central cholinergic system can be improved in laboratory animals without inducing physiologically non- programmed activations of said system. Pain threshold was increased and cognitive processes were improved without untoward side effects.This results was obtained by drugs suppressing the physiological counterreaction mechanism of the cholinergic synaptic autoreceptor and blocking other inhibitory presynaptic heteroreceptors located on the cholinergic synapse itself.Unfortunately, the selective antagonists of presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptors already known, which were utilized by us to obtain several
