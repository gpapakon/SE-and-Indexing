<CLAIMS>
Water-soluble, water-softening builder in tablet form 
consisting of: 


A) 60% to 98% by weight of a combination of 

a) citrate and/or citric acid and 
b) a polymer which is effective as a softener 
 
at a weight ratio of a:b ranging from 70:30 to 50:50, 

preferably from 65:35 to 55:45, 
B) 0.5% to 6% by weight of polyethylene glycol 
C) 0% to 38% by weight of other auxiliaries. 
Water-softening builder according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the polymer is a biodegradable polymer 

on a peptide basis. 
Water-softening builder according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the polymer is a maleic acid-acrylic 

acid copolymer. 
Water-softening builder according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that citric acid is used 

as component (a) and/or a partially neutralized acidic 
polymer is used as component (b) and carbonate and/or 

bicarbonate as a disintegrant is used as component (C).
