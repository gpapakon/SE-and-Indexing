<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to liquid
crystals, and, more particularly, to an improved configuration
in a liquid crystal light valve which includes a new
spacing technique for uniform and controllable liquid crystal
layer thicknesses.One type of liquid crystal electro-optical device is
constructed by placing a thin layer of liquid crystal between
two transparent plates, or one transparent plate and
one mirrored plate, that have each been coated with a layer
of an electrical conductor on its interior face. When no
electric field is applied (field-OFF) between the conductive
layers, the director of the liquid crystal is in one
state. (The "director" of the liquid crystal is the macroscopic
direction of the long molecular axis of the liquid
crystal molecules.) When an electric field is applied
(field-ON), the director reorients to another state. Because
the liquid crystal is birefringent, the two states
will have different refractive indices. The movement of
the director causes a polarization re-orientation as the
light passes through the liquid crystal layer. The state
change responsive to an applied electric field is the basis
for liquid crystal devices that control light, such as displays
and projectors. In its usual form, a liquid crystal light valve (LCLV)
is a device that modulates a polarized projection light
beam on a pixel-by-pixel basis as it passes through a liquid
crystal layer. A photoactivated LCLV performs the pixelized
modulation with a writing beam directed against the
backside of a reflective-mode liquid crystal layer.A simplified version of a photoactivated LCLV includes
a transparent input substrate, usually comprising glass,
upon which is formed a transparent back electrode layer,
such as indium tin oxide or P++ semiconductor, and a layer
of photoconductor material, such as silicon or cadmium sulfide.
A light-blocking layer, such as SiO2 or CdTe, prevents
light entering the readout side of the device from
entering the photoconductor, while a dielectric or metal
matrix mirror on the readout side of the light-blocking
layer reflects a readout beam. A liquid crystal layer is
sandwiched between alignment layers on the readout side of
the mirror, with a counter-electrode layer and a front
transparent substrate formed in turn on the readout side of
the liquid crystal cell.An AC voltage source is connected across the back
electrode and counter electrode to establish a bias that
sets an operating point for the liquid crystal. In operation,
an input image from an optical source such
