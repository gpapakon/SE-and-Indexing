<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a homogeneous 
electrorheological fluid which is useful as an actuator for 
vibration absorption, torque transmission servo control 
system, etc. This application is a divisional of 
EP-A-0 478 034. An electrorheolgical fluid whose viscosity greatly, 
instantaneously, and reversibly changes on voltage application 
has been well known since the 1940's as a so-called Winslow 
fluid, comprising an insulating oil having dispersed therein 
water-containing fine particles, such as silica and starch 
(see U.S. Patent 2,417,850). Since then, many improvements on electrorheological 
fluids have hitherto been proposed. For example, it has been 
proposed to use, as water-containing fine particles, ion 
exchange resin particles (see JP-A-50-92278, the term "JP-A" 
as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application") or zeolite particles (see JP-A-2-3711), or to 
use non-water-containing particles, such as organic semi-conductor 
particles (see British Patent 2,170,510), conductor 
particles having the surfaces thereof rendered insulating (see 
JP-A-64-6093), and liquid crystal polymer particles (see 
Proceedings of the 2nd Int'1 Conf. on ERF, p. 231 (1989)). 
These electrorheological liquids containing fine particles 
exhibit excellent performance properties for a short period of 
time but unavoidably undergo sedimentation and flocculation of 
dispersed particles and become muddy with the passage of time. 
They have thus not seen practical use. On the other hand, homogeneous liquids containing no 
particles which are now under study include polar liquids, 
e.g., nitromethane and nitrobenzene (see Japan J. Appl. Phys.,  
 
Vol. 16, p. 1775 (1977)), cholesteric liquid crystal mixtures 
(see Communications p. 3865 (1965)), low-molecular liquid 
crystals, e.g., methoxybenzylidenebutylaniline (MBBA) (see 
Japan J. Appl. Phys., 171525 (1978) and British Patent 
2208515A), and ferroelectric polymer solutions (see Dai 39-kai 
Kobunshi Toronkai Yokosyu, 18U07 (1990)). However, these 
liquids reveal no substantial electrorheological effect. Furthermore, for operation these conventional 
electrorheological fluids require the application of high 
voltages of 2 to 3 kV/mm. Such electrorheological fluids are 
limited to use at low temperatures since current value 
increases rapidly at high temperatures. Liquid crystals undergo molecular orientation when a 
voltage is applied to them to cause anisotropy in various 
characteristics. For example, a change in elasticity has been 
repo
