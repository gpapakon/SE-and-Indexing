<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are cytokines which are site-specifically mutated to have one unpaired cysteine residue located apart from the receptor-binding site, and conjugates thereof, in particular, conjugates where a lipophilic group is conjugated to the unpaired cysteine residue, and to such conjugates of cytokines which have an unpaired cysteine residue located apart from the receptor-binding site in the native form. All of these cytokines are of the type such that conjugation of a lipophilic group to the unpaired cysteine residue does not significantly affect the receptor binding or biological acitivity of the conjugated product. Also disclosed are conjugates where a lipophilic group, an antibody, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, fluorescein substances, biotin, or a cytotoxin is conjugated to the unpaired cysteine residue. These fatty acyl conjugated cytokines penetrate better and are retained longer in local sites and can be locally administered to treat, e.g., solid tumors, spinal injuries, the external genital area, the throat, ears, nasal linings, eyes, and skin.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CYTOKINES WITH AN UNPAIRED CYSTEINE RESIDUE AND CONJUGATES THEREOFField of the InventionThe invention relates to cytokines which are site-specifically mutated to have one unpaired cysteine residue located apart from the receptor-binding site, andconjugates thereof, in particular, conjugates where a lipophilic group is conjugated to the unpaired cysteine residue, and to such conjugates of cytokines which have an unpaired cysteine residue located apart from the receptor-binding site in the native form. Background of InventionCytokines act on cells to regulate cell growth, maturation or cellular activity, by either stimulating or inhibiting growth or maturation or activity of neighboring, functionally related cell types. Cytokines are synthesized and secreted by lymphocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, neuronal cells, or other cell types.The in vitro studies on cytokines indicate that they are generally very potent factors which act at very low concentrations. Each cytokine can have many different effects (pleiotropicity), and act locally on several functionally related cell types. For example, at the site of tissue repair, or inflammation, or of immune response, a cytokine is generally involved in a loop of regulatory processes. The cytokine regulates not only the maturation and activity of the target cells, but the production of the cytokine itself is also regulated by certain local factors. For example, in the microenvironment of a site into which an immunogen is administered, the macrophages are activated and induced to secrete interleukin-1 ("IL-1"). IL-1 

 activates the neighboring antigen-specific T cells. These activated T cells then secreteinterleukin-2 ("IL-2") which acts upon the T cells in an autocrine fashion and the activated T cells also secrete 7-interferon CIFN-7") which further activates the macrophages and B cell growth factors, which in turn activate the neighboring antigen-specific B cells.The localized function of cytokines is to be contrasted with hormones of the endocrine system. A hormone is synthesized by a localized tissue or organ and carried by the blood circulation to act on a tissue or organ systemically, or one which is located in a different part of the body. Cytokines generally are small proteins, and are made in small quantities. They are generally not detectable in the circulation even with very sensitive immunochemical assays. Cytokines have very high affinity for their receptors on the target cells, and need only bind to a small portion of the receptors on the surface
