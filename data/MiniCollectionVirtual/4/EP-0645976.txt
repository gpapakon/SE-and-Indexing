<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to office chairs, and more particularly, to a height adjustable, tiltable
office chair which supports the body of a user in ergonomically desirable positions for performing various tasks.Office chairs are typically configured to allow tilting of the seat and backrest as a unit or tilting of the backrest
relative to the seat.Examples of chairs of this type are disclosed in EP-A-0,250,207 and US-A-4,502,729. In the first of these documents
there is described a chair in which the seat of the chair is mounted on a base by pivotal support members which
form, together with the seat and base, a quadrilateral linkage having generally horizontal axes extending transversely
of the seat. The linkage extends generally between the front and rear of the seat. The spacing of the pivot axes of the
support members are selected so that the seat is movable relative to the base. Specifically, the seat portion of the seat
is movable between a rearwardly inclined lower position and a forward upper position. The back rest portion of the seat
may be connected for movement with the rear-most one of the support members so that it inclines relative to the seat
portion as the seat portion moves relative to the base.By contrast in US-A-4,502,729 there is described a reclining chair containing a conventional seat portion pivotable
about a fixed pivot shaft or axle and a backrest containing a backrest plate displaceable upon guide rails. These
guide rails are pivoted to a greater extent than the seat during the rearward reclining of the seat, due to the action of a
guide element connected with a piston rod of a pneumatic spring arrangement.In chairs having a backrest pivotally attached to a seat in a conventional manner, the movement of the backrest
relative to the seat can create shear forces acting on the legs and back of the user. These shear forces tend to cause
an uncomfortable pulling of the user's clothing. In an attempt to compensate for these shear forces, some office chairs
include a backrest which pivots while the seat tilts, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,859,801 (Moore) and
4,429,917 (Diffrient). To provide a chair which naturally conforms to the pivotal movement of both the legs and trunk of
a user between tilt positions, it is desirable to provide a chair having a seat and backrest which pivot generally about the
axis of the hip joints of the user.To further ensure comfortable tilting between tilt positions and enhance the comfort of a user while in a given
tilt

<CLAIMS>
A tiltable chair (30) comprising: a base member
(38,42,44); a seat (32) having a seating surface; a

back (34); and a linkage assembly (40) connecting the
