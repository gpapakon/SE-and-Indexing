<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an anchoring organ (1) which is intended for implantation in tissues, essentially has a rotationally symmetrical design and is made of a tissue-compatible material, for supporting prostheses, artificial joint parts and the like. The anchoring organ has an external screw thread (2) which starts from its upper end (4) and extends in the direction of the opposite insertion end (3). The anchoring organ (1) is provided with at least one slot-shaped gap (5, 5a) located in the surface provided with the external screw thread at a distance from the insertion end (3). During introduction of the anchoring organ (1) and the healing-in time of the latter in a recess prepared in the tissue, the gap (5, 5a) is expediently provided with a detachable strip (6, 6a) which shields the gap (5, 5a). Once the anchoring organ (1) has settled in the tissue, the covering organ (6, 6a) can be exchanged for a holder (16), for a prosthesis and the like, which can be inserted in the gap. The invention also comprises an anchoring device which has at least one of said anchoring organs and said holders or connections.

introduction end 3, and at least one slot-shaped gap 5
being provided at a distance from the introduction end 3

in the surface formed with the external threading 2,
characterised in that the slot-shaped gap 5, 5a of the

anchoring member 1 starts from the rear end, extends
mainly axially, and is provided for the releasable

reception of a covering member filling the slot-shaped
gap 5, 5a while the anchoring member is being screwed

into a recess previously prepared in the tissue.
An anchoring member according to Claim 1, characterised
in that during the application of the anchoring

member 1 in a recess previously prepared in the tissue
and during the osseointegration period, said anchoring

member 1 is provided with a releasable strip-shaped
cover 6, 6a which screens the gap 5, 5a.
An anchoring member according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that after the covering strip 6, 6a has

been removed, the gap 5, 5a is provided for the reception
of said prosthesis parts, artificial joints and

parts of joints and the like in a fixable position.
An anchoring member according to Claims 1-3, characterised
in that the gap 5, 5a is a groove which is

milled in the anchoring member and whose boundary edges
are provided for the releasable fixation of the covering

strip 6, 6a.
An anchoring member according to Claims 1-4, characterised
by an internal bore 8 which starts from the

rear end 4 of the anchoring member 1 and is connected to 
said gap 5, 5a.
An anchoring member according to Claim 5, characterised
in that the length of the internal bore is

slightly greater than the length of the slot-shaped gap
5, 5a cooperating therewith.
An anchoring member according to Claim 5 or 6,
characterised in that the covering strip 6, 6a consists

of an entraining member 13 which is adapted by means of
at least one axial projection 14 to be inserted and

cover said slot-shaped gap 5, 5a, while at least partially
filling the internal bore, and which is so constructed

that when the entraining member rotates, the
anchoring member makes a corresponding rotation.
An anchoring member according to Claim 7, characterised
in that the slot-shaped gap 5 is constructed

with notches 39 taking the form of recesses disposed on
its longitudinal sides for fixing the position of the

entraining member 13 or for fixing the position of a
holder 16 inserted into the gap for the reception of

prosthesis elements and the like, the diameter of the
internal bore 8 being larger than the width of the gap

5, 5a measured perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis
of the internal bore.
An anchoring member according to Claim 8, characterised
in that after the introduction of the anchoring

member 1 into the tissue, the entraining member 13 can
be interchanged for a holder 16 of basically identical

construction, the holder 16 being provided with a base
plate 17 disposed on the projection 14 for the retention

of prosthesis parts and the like.
An anchoring member according to Claim 9, characterised
in that after the introduction of the holder 16

into the internal bore 8, the rear end of the anchoring
member 1 can be closed by a stop screw 18, accompanied

by the simultaneous fixation of the holder 16 in 
position.
An anchoring member according to Claims 9 and 10,
characterised in that the holder 16 has a continuous

bore 21 for the reception of a pin 22 whose front threaded
portion cooperates with a matching thread 24 in the

end of the internal bore 8.
An anchoring member according to Claim 11, characterised
in that the pin 22 has an external thread 25 for

the fixation of the holder 16 in position for cooperation
with a matching internal thread 26 in the bore 21

disposed in the holder 16.
An anchoring member according to one of Claims 9-12,
characterised in that a portion 28 of the holder 16

at least partially fills the bore 8, the top side of
said portion 28 having at least in zones projections 29,

30, which for the fixation of the holder 16 in position
cooperate with notches 31, 32 provided in the internal

bore 8.
An anchoring member according to one of Claims 9-13,
