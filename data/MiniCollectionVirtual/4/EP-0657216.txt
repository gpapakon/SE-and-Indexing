A pipette system with a syringe (1) comprising a syringe flange (7) and a syringe
piston (4) and with a pipette (23) which in a pipette housing (24) comprises a

receiver (25) for the syringe flange (7) and in a receiver body (27) a syringe
receiver for the syringe piston (4), with fastening means (29, 31) for the reversible

fixing of the syringe flange (7) and syringe piston (4) in their receivers and with
piston setting means (28) for displacing the receiver body (27) in the pipette

housing (24), wherein the syringe (1) comprises an information carrier (8) with
information about the syringe and/or its condition, and the pipette (23) has a

scanning means (11) for the information on the information carrier (8) and an
evaluation means for the information read by the scanning means (11),

characterised in that the syringe flange (7) and the syringe piston (4) are axially
slidable into their fastening positions in the pipette (23) through axial openings (33,

34) of their receivers (25, 27), wherein the information carrier (8) moves into a

scanning position with respect to the scanning means (11), and that the syringe
flange (7) comprises a ring (8) with several axially aligned scanning surfaces (9) at

an axial position as an information carrier, wherein the syringe (1) can be inserted
into the pipette (23) in various rotational positions.

(11) scans mechanically, electrically, optically, magnetically, inductively,

capacitively and/or acoustically.
A pipette system according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the information
carrier is formed on an adapter flange of an adapter connected to the syringe (1). 
A pipette system according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
scanning surfaces (9) have two different axial positions on the syringe (1).
A pipette system according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that in total
seven scanning surfaces (9) are provided.
A pipette system according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the syringe
flange (7) has at least one alignment lug (10) and the flange receiver (25) at least

one guiding groove (35) for the guiding lug.
