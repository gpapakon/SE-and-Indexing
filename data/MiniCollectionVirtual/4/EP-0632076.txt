<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of a multilayer finish by applying a base coat comprising an aqueous (water-borne) coating composition to a substrate and then applying a layer of a clear coat containing organic solvents, which gives coatings having excellent hardness and gloss. To this end, the base coat layer is produced by applying an aqueous coating composition, containing, in addition to water, one or more pigments and optionally one or more organic solvents, neutralisers and additives which are conventional in paints, as binder:  a combination of   I) from 99.5 to 85 % by weight of one or more aqueous, physically drying polyurethane binders having such a content of OH groups and acid functions that the OH number does not exceed 10 and the acid number does not exceed 30, of which from 10 to 50 % by weight based on the solids content of component I), can be replaced by one or more unsaturated products of the reaction of carboxyl-functional polycondensates with ethylenically unsaturated monomers, and II) from 0.5 to 15 % by weight of one or more polyisocyanates which are liquid at room temperature or have been liquefied by means of organic solvents and contain more than one free isocyanate group, from the group consisting of diisocyanates of the formula

 in which the radicals R1 and R2 can in each case be identical or different and where     R1 = -H or -CnH2n+1   R2 = -CnH2n+1,   where n = an integer from 1 to 6 and A = a single bond, an aromatic or alicyclic radical or a linear or branched aliphatic radical having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and/or polyisocyanates derived therefrom, where up to 40 % by weight, based on the solids content of the polyisocyanate component II, can be replaced by one or more different polyisocyanates which are liquid at room temperature or have been liquefied by means of organic solvents and contain more than one free isocyanate group, where the percentages by weight of the components I) and II) are in each case based on their solids content and add up to 100 % by weight, and where component II) is added to the coating composition just before its application.

A method of producing a multi-layer coating by the application of a base lacquer coat of an
aqueous coating medium to a substrate and the subsequent application of a coat of a clear

lacquer containing an organic solvent, characterised in that for the production of the base
lacquer coat an aqueous coating medium is applied which, in addition to water, one or

more pigments and also optionally one or more organic solvents, neutralising agents and
customary lacquer additives, contains the following as binder vehicles:

a combination of

I) 99.5 to 85 % by weight of one or more aqueous, physically drying polyurethane
binder vehicles with a content of OH groups and acid functions such that an OH

number of 10 and an acid number of 30 are not exceeded, of which 10 to 50 % by
weight, with respect to the weight of solids, of component I) can be replaced by

one or more unsaturated reaction products of carboxy-functional polycondensates
with ethylenically unsaturated monomers, and
II) 0.5 to 15 % by weight of one or more polyisocyanates which are liquid at room
temperature or which are liquefied by organic solvents and which contain more

than one free isocyanate group, from the group comprising diisocyanates of general
formula



wherein the R

 and R
2
 radicals can each be the same or different, and wherein

R

R

wherein n = an integer from 1 to 6, and


A =
a single bond, an aromatic or alicyclic radical, or a linear or branched aliphatic
radical containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms; or the reaction products thereof with

water or polyhydric alcohols, or uretdiones, isocyanurates and/or biurets thereof,
wherein 40 % by weight, with respect to the weight of solids, of polyisocyanate

component II can be replaced by one or more polyisocyanates which are different
therefrom, which are liquid at room temperature or which are liquefied by organic

solvents, and which contain more than one free isocyanate group,

wherein the percentages by weight of components I) and II) are each given with respect to
the solids content thereof and add up to 100 % by weight, and wherein component II) is

added to the coating medium shortly before the application thereof,

and that the clear lacquer coat is applied to the base coating thus obtained after drying or
wet-into-wet and is optionally hardened together with the base lacquer coat.
A substrate provided with a multi-layer coating, characterised in that the multi-layer coating
has been produced by the method of claim 1.
