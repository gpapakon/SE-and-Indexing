<ABSTRACT>
An optical fiber (1) intended to be used as a sensor is of 
the kind 
suitable for communication and has a longitudinal cavity 
or hole (7) which can be intentionally closed or has a more 

narrow shape at definite positions (8) in the longitudinal 
direction of the fiber (1). The cavity (7), the diameter of which 

can be of the magnitude of order of 5 µm - 50 µm, is filled with 
a material changing its volume depending on physical quantities 

in the fiber environment. The hole (7) can be closed or made 
narrower at different positions (7) in the longitudinal direction 

of the fiber for instance by locally heating the fiber by a 
pulsed laser beam.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical fiber, which is
intended to be used in sensors of various kinds,
to a method for preparing such an optical fiber
and to a sensor in which the optical fibre is used.Optical fibers are in many cases suited to be used as signal
sensors for various physical parameters. Advantages of an optical
fiber are generally the insensitivity thereof to exterior
electric and magnetic interference and further, that one part of
the optical fiber can be used as a signal conductor directly
without requiring any galvanic connection by means of electric
conductors between the sensed point and a control or monitoring
device, receiving the signal generated by the sensor for further
processing.Fiber cables for detecting various parameters can make use of
microbending of an optical fiber, the fiber being of the ordinary
kind intended for communication, the bending in some way being
accomplished by an exterior device. The exterior device can be a
twisted filament or band, see
US-A-4,795,232, a wax
body located adjacent to the optical fiber, see US-A-5 251 274,
or a fiber enclosure made of a polymer having a
suitably chosen coefficient of thermal expansion, see
EP-A-0 490 849. All these cited patents are assigned to the
same assignee as the present application. The microbending of the
fiber cable can be detected by an OTDR system.Fibers having a liquid core have been suggested as sensors,
see the U.S. patents US-A-4,201,446, US-A-4,714,829 and US-A-4,373,768.Further, from the British patent application GB-A-2 189 900
an optical fiber is previously known which is provided with
longitudinal cavities in the cladding. The cavity or cavities are
located so that an optical interaction region is obtained. The
thickness of the cladding material located between the cavity and
the core is typically less than the core diameter. The fiber is
prepared by surrounding inner, suitably shaped preforms provided
with the primary substance for forming the core with a tubular
preform and by drawing the assembly thus composed in the usual 
way in a drawing machine for optical fibers. By a suitable
filling of the fiber cavity or the fiber cavities a polarizer can
be obtained and by rotating the fiber at the manufacture thereof
and by filling the cavity or cavities with a suitable substance
an optical attenuator can be obtained. With another suitable
filling material a component can be obtained for use in an
optical amplifier.Optical fibers having interaction regions in the shape of
metal strings located in the
