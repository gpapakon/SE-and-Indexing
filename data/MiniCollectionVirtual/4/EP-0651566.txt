<ABSTRACT>
A programmable on-focal plane signal processor (20, 21) having 
analog to digital conversion (20), nonuniformity correction, 

gamma spike compensation all digitally performed on a single 
silicon substrate (18) inside a dewar. The architecture 

supports time delay integration and spatial filtering to 
increase the signal to noise ratio of the focal plane 

array (1) data. The processor has programmable coefficients 
which may be changed while the system is operating or 

eliminated. The architecture provides increased signal noise 
ratio for infrared data and decreases the output data 

bandwidth from the infrared focal plane array (1) by two 
orders of magnitude.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to signal processing and 
more particularly, to space-borne signal processing for use at 
low temperatures and in a radiation environment. Space based threat warning systems use infrared focal plane 
arrays to detect potential missile threats. However, infrared 
focal plane arrays (FPAs) which operate in space have two 
inherent limitations. They must function in a cryogenically 
cooled environment (i.e. in a dewar) and their output must be 
corrected to compensate for errors induced by incident gamma 
rays. Currently, errors caused by gamma radiation, known as 
gamma spikes, are corrected using analog processing in a dewar 
or by digital or analog processing outside the dewar. Using 
analog processing inside the dewar or digital processing 
outside the dewar increases the amount of noise introduced 
into the FPA data. A typical focal plane signal processor is shown in Figure 
13. Figure 13 shows a typical infrared missile warning system 
with a staring sensor. A lens 12 is used to focus the IR 
energy from a portion of the sky/ground scene through an 
optical filter 14 and onto a focal plane array 16. The lens 
typically has a 60째 x 60째 field of view (FOV) and allows the 
sensor to collect IR energy from or "stare at" a portion of 
the sky/ground scene. This type of system is known as a 
staring system. Another category of infrared missile warning 
system uses a scanning sensor. In the scanning system the  
 
sensor is a line array (rather than a rectangular FPA in a 
staring system) and the optics scan the scene through the line 
array. The filter 14 can a color wheel. Alternatively, the color 
wheel may be replaced with an acousto-optic tunable filter 
(AOTF). The purpose of an optical filter is to limit the 
thermal energy which passes to the FPA. Targets have 
signatures with large amounts of thermal energy in very 
specific frequency bands. The optical filters are tuned to 
allow only energy in the target specific frequency bands to 
pass. Therefore, targets imaged by the FPA will have a 
greater signal to noise ratio after optical filtering. The focal point array 16 is a matrix of individual detector 
elements or pixels, which emit electrons when struck by 
incident photons. The term pixel is an abbreviation for 
picture element and is the smallest uniquely definable element 
in the scene. The value of each pixel represents the amount 
of infrared energy incident on a detector. The electrons 
emitted by the detectors are captured beneath each pixel and
