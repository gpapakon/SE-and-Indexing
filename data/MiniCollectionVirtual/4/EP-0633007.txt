<ABSTRACT>
A hinge assembly is provided for an orthopaedic brace having 
a rotatable hinge and a detent mechanism to automatically, yet 

releasably, lock the hinge in a fixed position or rotation. The hinge 
includes two rotatably attached members and the detent mechanism 

includes an indentation formed in the attached end of one member 
and a block pivotally mounted on the other member. The block has a 

locking projection that is biased toward the indentation and 
cooperates therewith to provide three positions of operation, a locked 

position, a release position, and an activated position. In the locked 
position, the locking projection fittingly engages the indentation, 

thereby substantially preventing rotation of the hinge. The release 
position displaces the locking projection a radial distance away from 

the indentation, thereby permitting the hinge to rotate freely. In the 
activated position, the block disengages the indentation and maintain 

an angular distance therefrom so that the detent mechanism does 
not obstruct rotation of the hinge, but enables automatic repositioning 

of the hinge assembly to the locked position whenever the locking 
projection and indentation angularly realign.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to orthopaedic 
braces, particularly to an orthopaedic brace having a rotatable 
hinge, and more particularly to a detent mechanism for releasably 
locking a hinged orthopaedic brace in a fixed position. Hinged orthopaedic braces having an adjustable range of 
hinge rotation, as disclosed by U.S. Patents 4,481,941 
have selectively positionable pins placed in 
predetermined holes about the hinge to act as stops limiting the 
range of hinge rotation and corresponding joint motion in 
accordance with the needs of the user. For example, it is oftentimes 
desirable to strictly limit the range of joint motion available to a 
patient immediately following surgery by limiting the range of hinge 
rotation that a brace positioned about the joint permits. The braces 
disclosed by the above-referenced patents are generally effective for 
this purpose. European Patent application 0 466 538, 
which is used as basis for the preamble of independent claim 1, 
discloses a joint 
prosthesis for lower limbs which allows locking of the lower limbs in 
an extension position. Although a limited degree of hinge rotation and corresponding 
joint motion can be desirable during rehabilitation of the joint, there 
are situations where it is advantageous to lock the hinge in a fixed 
position of rotation. For example, hinge rotation can be desirable 
when the patient is undergoing a controlled exercise regimen or 
when the patient is relaxing. Yet, the hinge is preferably maintained 
in a locked position when the patient initially resumes unsupervised 
activities, such as walking, to avoid reinjury to the joint before it is 
fully rehabilitated. As such, it is an object of the present invention to provide a 
hinge assembly for an orthopaedic brace  
 
that resists undesirable accidental 
repositioning of the assembly between the modes of operation. According to the present invention we provide a hinge 
assembly for an orthopaedic brace having a detent mechanism to 
releasably prevent rotation of a rotatable hinge in at least one 
direction, said hinge assembly comprising: 
a first member and a second member, wherein said first 
member rotatably engages said second member, thereby providing 
a rotatable hinge; an indentation formed in said first member; and a block pivotally mounted on said hinge assembly at a pivot 
point and said block having a locking projection, said hinge 
assembly positionable in a locked position or an activated position 
as said block is pivoted about said pivot
