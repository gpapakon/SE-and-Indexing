<ABSTRACT>
An optical amplifier includes an optical feedback resonant laser cavity (OFRC) including a power dependent loss element (PDLE) having the characteristic that as the incident laser power on the PDLE increases the cavity loss decreases. The OFRC with the PDLE provides optical gain control or optical power control for a WDM amplifier or a single channel power equalization amplifier (PEA), respectively. A 1xNxN WADM node incorporating more than one of these amplifiers, at least some of which commonly share a pump source, and a method for controlling a transient power change in a single channel optical amplifier or reducing a DC gain error in a WDM optical amplifier that are subject to dynamically variable operating conditions at an input of the amplifier, are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICAL AMPLIFIER WITH POWER DEPENDENT FEEDBACKBackground of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to fiber optical WDM transmission systems and optical amplifiers used therein, and more particularly to an optical feedback resonant laser cavity (OFRC), including a power dependent loss element (PDLE) for optical gain control (OGC) or optical power control (OPC), and to a method for implementing such control, which is particularly useful, although not so limited, in amplified wavelength add/drop multiplexed (WADM) transmission nodes.2. Technical BackgroundWavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is a demonstrated technology for increasing the capacity of existing fiber optic networks. A typical WDM system employs multiple optical signal channels, each channel being assigned a particular wavelength or wavelength band. In a WDM system, optical signal channels are generated, multiplexed to form an optical signal comprised of the individual optical signal channels, transmitted over a single waveguide, and demultiplexed such that each channel is individually routed to a designated receiver. Multiple optical channels can be amplified simultaneously in optical amplifiers such as erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs), facilitating the use of WDM systems for long distance transmission. Add-drop multiplexers are used, for instance, at nodes in a WDM 

communication network to extract one or more channels from the multiplexed stream, letting the remaining channels pass through unaltered to the next node, and to add to the multiplexed stream a new channel for transmission. Another application of such devices is for routing nodes of reconfigurable optical networks, namely rerouting certain information streams as a result of changed traffic conditions or to remedy a failure downstream from the node.As schematically illustrated in FIG. 1. a conventional WADM node 120 consists respectively of gain-controlled input and output amplifiers 121, 123, a pair of lxN and Nxl multiplexers/demultiplexers 125, 127, and an array of add/drop switches 129. This type of WADM node is herein referred to as a lxNxl node since there is a single input amplifier and a single output amplifier, both of which are likely gain flattened and gain controlled amplifiers. Wavelength add/drop multiplexing permits signals to be routed from different networks or propagate through different spans. As a result, however, the per channel power after each add/drop switch can vary significantly, say by YdB. An approach
