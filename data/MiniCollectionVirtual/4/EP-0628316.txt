<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an MRI contrast 
medium and, more particularly, to an MRI contrast medium 
using fluorine as a detectable nucleus. Magnetic resonance imaging (to be referred to as 
MRI hereinafter) is one of imaging diagnoses, like X-ray 
imaging, ultrasonic imaging, and nuclear medicine 
imaging. These imaging diagnoses can visually image 
pathological changes of living bodies. The imaging 
diagnoses are, therefore, very excellent means for 
making accurate diagnoses of diseases and are already 
used extensively. Among other imaging diagnoses, MRI is 
a promising imaging diagnosis which has rapidly 
spread and developed in recent years. MRI which is currently being employed in clinical 
examinations uses ¹H as a detectable nucleus. A 
measurement target in such MRI is primarily water 
molecules which exist in a large amount in a living 
tissue. The principle of this ¹H-MRI is as follows. The relaxation time, the ¹H density, the ¹H 
chemical shift, and the like of ¹H constituting a water 
molecule change depending on an environment in which the 
water molecule is present. In particular, water 
molecules present in different tissues of a living body 
can be distinguished from each other by the difference 
in relaxation time of ¹H between the water molecules. 
Therefore, by measuring the relaxation time of ¹H for  
 
many water molecules distributed in a living body and 
imaging the differences in relaxation time between these 
water molecules, various tissues of the living body can 
be imaged. Likewise, it is also possible to distinguish 
a water molecule in a pathologically abnormal tissue 
from a water molecule in a normal tissue in accordance 
with the difference in relaxation time of ¹H between 
these water molecules, and so the pathologically 
abnormal tissue shows an MRI image different from that 
of the normal tissue. Therefore, pathological 
abnormalities can be diagnosed on the basis of MRI 
images. Recently, on the other hand, MRI diagnoses using 
nuclides other than ¹H as detectable nuclei are also 
being attempted. Examples of the nuclide other than ¹H, 
which are NMR-spectroscopically detectable, are ¹⁹F, 
23Na, ³¹P, and ¹³C. When the relative sensitivity and 
the isotope abundance are taken into account, however, 
nuclides practically applicable to the MRI diagnoses are 
¹⁹F and ³¹P. These two nuclides have already been 
researched for clinical applications. An example of the 
applications examined is MRS (magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy) using ³¹P as a detectable nucleus
