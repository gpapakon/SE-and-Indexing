<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic reproducing and recording system for 
duplicating video information employs a helical scanning 

apparatus which is adapted for helically scanning a multiple 
number of tracks on a magnetic tape (20) and which comprises a tape 

transport means (30) for moving the magnetic tape at a speed as N 
times high as a standard tape movement speed and a rotatable 

head drum assembly (10,50) for scanning the magnetic tape, the head 
drum assembly (50) having 2N number of video heads 

(CH₁,CH₂,CH₃,CH₄) arranged in N 
number of pairs mounted thereon with a diametrically opposite 

relationship in such a manner that each of the video heads is 
angularly separated from one another by 360°/2N and having 

azimuth angles different from each other in an alternate 
fashion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a helical scanning 
apparatus for use in a magnetic recording and reproducing 
system; and, more particularly, to a multi-track scanning 
apparatus of a magnetic tape loaded in the magnetic recording 
and reproducing system. In a magnetic recording and reproducing system such as a 
video cassette recorder("VCR"), a helical scanning apparatus 
is normally employed to scan a magnetic tape through the use 
of a cylindrical rotatable drum assembly called "scanner" 
having a pair of video heads installed in a diametrically 
opposite relationship thereon for recording and/or reproducing 
a video signal. Each video head is in contact with the tape for each 
revolution of the drum assembly to record or reproduce the 
video signal on a per field basis. In such a helical scanning apparatus, it is sometimes 
necessary to reproduce or record video signals at a high speed 
for the purpose of fast duplication. One of the important 
variables that control the duplication speed is the tape  
 
movement speed. The faster the tape movement speed is, the 
higher the duplication speed becomes. However, as the tape 
movement speed increases, the trajectory of the video heads 
tends to be misaligned with respect to their corresponding 
tracks on the tape due to the change in the relative speed 
between the tape and the video heads in contact with the tape. 
Therefore, there may occur cross talks caused by one of the 
video heads scanning a portion of its adjacent track. The 
cross talks in turn may produce a noise band in a reproduced 
picture. Another important variable is the number of the heads 
mounted on the drum assembly. Certain VCR models include an 
extra pair of video heads. For example, one of the multi-head 
VCR system disclosed in U.S.Patent No. 5,311,375 issued to 
Yoshiyuki Ikushima et al. includes a head arrangement on a 
drum assembly having a first and a second pairs of heads. The 
first pair of heads scans to form a first and a second tracks 
spaced apart by approximately one track width, and the second 
pair scans to form a third and a fourth tracks spaced apart by 
approximately one track width and in an interlaced manner with 
the first and the second tracks. Such head arrangement may be 
useful in improving the quality of a reproduced picture in a 
special reproducing mode such as a still, fast forward, or cue 
mode; but is not adequate for use in the fast reproduction of 
prerecorded video signal. U.S. Patent No. 5,184,254 issued to Kaneko et. al shows
