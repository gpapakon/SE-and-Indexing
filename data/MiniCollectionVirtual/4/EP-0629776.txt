<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injector (50) for an internal combustion engine 
includes a main body (51) including a timing bore, a 

timing plunger (63) disposed in the timing bore, an 
electronically-operated solenoid valve assembled to the 

main body (51), a nozzle (54) having a needle bore (72) 
and an injection needle (75) disposed in the needle bore 

(72) which needle (75) is operable under certain 
conditions to lift so as to initiate fuel injection. 

Disposed between the main body (51) and the nozzle member 
(54) is a one-piece adapter (53) which is designed to 

include an axially-extending metering bore and a needle 
spring cavity (83). A metering plunger (65) is disposed 

within the metering bore and a biasing spring (76) is 
disposed within the needle spring cavity (83). At the 

base of the needle spring cavity (83) is a button (77) 
which serves as a direct abutment interface between the 

top of the needle (75) and the bottom of the biasing 
spring (76). The thickness of the button (77) controls 

the preload on the spring (76) and this is the force 
which
 must be overcome by fuel pressure present in the 
needle spring cavity (83) in order to allow the needle 

(75) to lift so as to create an injection opening between 
the needle (75) and the tip of the nozzle (54) for the 

fuel at high pressure to be injected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to fuel 
injection systems and devices for internal combustion 
engines. More specifically the present invention relates to 
an improved mechanical design for portions of a fuel 
injection device so as to provide a more reliable, lower cost 
fuel injector. Many motor vehicles, whether compression ignition or 
spark ignition engines, are provided with electronic fuel 
injection systems in order to satisfy the need for precise 
and reliable fuel delivery into the cylinders of the 
engines. Precision and reliability are demanded to address 
the goals of increasing fuel efficiency, maximizing power 
output, and controlling undesirable products of combustion. Several electronic fuel injection systems designed for 
iiiternal combustion engines use a mechanical linkage from the 
engine in order to pressurize the fuel charge. Using 
mechanical pressurization, an extremely high injection 
pressure, now often exceeding 20,000 psi (13,800 Newtons per 
square centimeter) and occasionally reaching a transient peak 
value of 23,500 psi (16,200 Newtons per square centimeter), 
is developed within the timing chamber of the injector. A 
higher fuel injection pressure provides a cleaner exhaust 
because particulate emissions are reduced, and is thus 
desirable to meet the tightened emissions standards which are 
being and will be imposed on motor vehicles. One feature of the electronic fuel injection system which 
can be regarded as the predecessor to the present invention 
is the addition of a solenoid control valve to the top area 
of the injector. The predecessor injector, as well as the 
fuel injection device of the present invention, uses cam  
 
shaft actuation in order to build injection pressures. 
While much of the operation of the fuel injection device 
of the present invention is virtually identical to the 
predecessor design, certain improvements have been made 
in order to improve the quality and to lower the cost. 
The number of parts has been reduced and a plurality of 
high pressure seal joints have been eliminated. The 
reduction in the trapped volume, a consequence of the 
present invention, improves performance of the fuel 
injection device of the present invention over that of 
the predecessor design. In addition to the predecessor injector which has 
been mentioned above and which is described in greater 
detail hereinafter, there are a wide variety of other 
fuel injection systems and devices. A representative 
sampling of these other systems and devices is
