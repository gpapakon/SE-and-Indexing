<ABSTRACT>
When an electronic component and a wiring board are connected to each other by soldering, the present 
invention uses, as an alloy to be plated, an alloy containing 0.01 to 90 wt% of palladium in lead, tin or their alloy as 

a thin film to be formed on a to-be-plated portion of the electronic component or the wiring board so as to effectively 
carry out the connection. Particularly preferred is an alloy containing 0.1 to 70 wt% of lead, 0.1 to 90 wt% of tin and 

0.01 to 90 wt% of palladium. Furthermore, when this alloy further contains 0.1 to 20 wt% of phosphorus or 0.01 to 
10 wt% of boron, the drop of solderability of the alloy due to heat can be much more reduced. When 0.1 to 20 wt% 

of indium is contained, the melting point of the alloy can be lowered and when 0.1 to 20 wt% of silver is contained, 
leaching can be reduced. This alloy to be plated is preferably formed on the to-be-plated portion by electrolytic or 

electroless plating by the use of a plating solution for the alloy to be plated which contains 0.001 to 2 mols/l of a 
palladium compound, 0.001 to 3 mols/l of a tin compound and or 0.001 to 2 mols/l of a lead compound. In the 
case of 
electroless plating, it is preferred to use a plating solution additionally containing 0.01 to 1 mol/l of a reducing agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solderable alloy mainly 
composed of lead or tin or both of them. More 
particularly, it relates to a solderable alloy that has a 
superior solderability, may hardly cause deterioration of 
its solderability on account of heat or humidity, requires 
no flux treatment when soldered, and therefore makes it 
unnecessary to use fluorine type solvents such as 
chlorofluorocarbons or chlorine type solvents such as 
trichloroethylene commonly used to remove the flux by 
cleaning after soldering has been completed. In the connection of electronic parts through 
wiring, soldering has been hitherto widely applied. For 
example, in printed circuit boards, a solder layer is 
directly formed on the portions to be soldered on the 
board, e.g., on the lands of copper through-holes or the 
inside surfaces of the through-holes, by the solder 
leveler process or dip soldering, and thereafter leads of 
electronic parts such as resistors are inserted into the 
through-holes, followed by dipping in a solder bath to 
carry out soldering.  Incidentally, in recent years, with an improvement 
in wiring density on printed circuit boards and a tendency 
toward multilayer structure of the boards themselves, the 
through-holes have become smaller in diameter and higher 
in their aspect ratios. In the case of such printed 
circuit boards with high-density wiring, formation of 
solder layers on the inside surfaces of through-holes by 
the conventional solder leveler process or dip soldering 
has been involved in the problem that the through-holes 
are clogged with solder to make it impossible to insert 
the leads of electronic parts into the holes, or solder 
bridges are formed between the lands of through-holes to 
cause short circuit. The surfaces of solder layers formed by the 
conventional solder leveler process or the like are not 
smooth but protuberant. Hence, when electronic parts are 
connected by what is called surface mounting, there is 
another problem that the electronic parts tend to be 
misregistered and it is difficult to automate the surface 
mounting. Accordingly, in printed circuit boards with high-density 
wiring, a thin film of a solderable metal such as 
solder, tin, nickel or gold is previously formed on the 
portions to be soldered, e.g., on the inside surfaces of 
through-holes, by electrolytic plating or electroless  
 
plating. Thereafter, like the conventional cases, the 
leads of electronic parts are inserted into the through-holes, 
and the insides of the through-holes are
