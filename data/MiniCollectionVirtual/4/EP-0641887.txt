<CLAIMS>
A tool (E) for a screed (B) for a road finisher 
(F), which is constructed in the form of a strip, 

comprises working surfaces (18, 22, 23) and is 
connected to an actuating drive (7, 8; 12, 13) of a 

tamper (T) or of a high-compression presser device (P), 
the tool (E) consisting of a wearing part (V) having 

the working surfaces (18, 22, 23), and a carrier part 
(C) which exchangeably holds the wea
ring part (V), 
characterised in that the wearing part (V) consists of 

material which is more wear-resistant than the carrier 
part (C). 
A tool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the wearing part (V) consists of an impact-proof high-strength 

metal alloy. 
A tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the wearing part (V) is at least one casting. 
A tool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the wearing part (B) and the carrier part (C) in the 

tool (E) form a stepless substantially vertical tool 
front side or stepless substantially vertical tool 

front and rear sides. 
A tool according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the wearing part (V) consists of 

a plurality of wearing part portions, preferably of 
equal length, which abut one another transversely of 

the road laying direction and which are mounted on the 
carrier part (C) so as to be individually removable and 

exchangeable.  
 
A tool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the carrier part (C) is an extruded profile. 
A tool according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the wearing part (V) is 

approximately C-shaped in cross-section and engages 
displaceably transversely of the direction of travel in 

guides (27), preferably guide grooves, disposed on the 
carrier part (C). 
A tool according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the carrier part (C) consists of hardened steel. 
A road finisher (F) with a screed (B) which has at 
least one exchangeably mounted tool (E) according to 

any one of the preceding claims as a tamper strip or as 
a high-compression presser strip.
