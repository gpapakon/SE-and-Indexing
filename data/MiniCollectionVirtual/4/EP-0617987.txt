<ABSTRACT>
A golf club head (10) made of a suitable metal such as 
stainless steel includes a hollow body (12) and a hosel (14). 

The hollow body (12) has a weight pad 
(38) which provides the golf club head (10) with increased 

resistance to rotation or twisting upon impact with golf balls at 
off-center points (34,36) on the face (24). The weight paid (38) 

weights between 5 and 15 grams and is located in the heel portion 
(12a) of the body (12). The weight pad (38) is elongated in a 

direction extending along a length dimension of the body side 
wall (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to golf clubs and, in 
particular, to a golf club head with a weight pad for 
increasing resistance to rotation or twisting of the golf 
club head on off-center impacts with golf balls. Golf clubs known as "woods" traditionally have a head 
made of a suitable wooden material such as maple or persimmon 
attached to one end of an elongated shaft. These wooden club 
heads are usually solid and are shaped with their weight 
properly distributed about their center of gravity to 
maximize performance. Golf club "wood" heads have also been 
formed of suitable metals such as stainless steel. Metal 
heads are usually hollow. Various attempts have been made to 
distribute weight in metal heads with respect to their center 
of gravity so that performance is maximized. Such attempts 
have included placing different types and numbers of weight 
members at different locations inside the metal heads. 
Examples of such attempts are disclosed in prior U.S. Patents 
Nos. 1,167,106 to Palmer; 1,526,438 to Scott; 1,582,836 to 
Link; 5,058,895 to Igarashi; and 5,141,230 to Antonious. In 
the Palmer, Scott and Link patents, weight members are 
located directly behind the center of gravity of the club  
 
head. In the Igarashi and Antonious patents, weight members 
are located in heel and toe portions of the club heads. The present invention provides a golf club head having a 
center of gravity. The golf club head includes a hollow body 
having a heel portion, a toe portion, a top wall, a bottom 
wall, a side wall between the top and bottom walls, a front 
wall with a face arranged for impacting a golf ball. The 
golf club head also includes a hosel for receiving one end of 
an elongated shaft. The face has a sweet spot thereon 
aligned with the center of gravity so that when a golf ball 
is impacted at the sweet spot no rotation of the club head 
will occur. The face is disposed forwardly of and inclined 
with respect to a first vertical plane containing a 
longitudinal axis of the elongated shaft, and the face 
intersects and is substantially perpendicular to a second 
vertical plane containing the center of gravity. The second 
vertical plane divides the body into the heel and toe 
portions. A weight pad is disposed along the side wall in 
the heel portion of the body rearwardly of the first vertical 
plane and intermediate the hosel and the second vertical 
plane. The weight pad provides the golf club head with 
increased resistance to horizontal rotation about a vertical 
axis that

<CLAIMS>
A golf club head (10) having a center of gravity (28), said 
golf club head (10) comprising: 


a hollow body (12) having a heel portion (12a), a toe portion (12b), a 
top wall (16), a bottom wall (18), a side wall (20) between said top 

(16) and 
bottom (18) walls, a front wall (22) with a face (24) for impacting a golf 

ball; and 
a hosel (14) for receiving one end of an elongated shaft (30); 
said face (24) having a sweet spot (26) thereon aligned with the 
center of gravity (28) so that when a golf ball is impacted at 

said sweet spot (28) no rotation of the club head (10) will occur, said 
face (24) being disposed forwardly of and inclined with respect to 

a first vertical plane (A) containing a longitudinal axis (32) of the 
elongated shaft (30), said face (24) intersecting and being 

substantially perpendicular to a second vertical plane (B) 
containing the center of gravity (28), said second vertical plane (B) 

dividing said body (12) into said heel (12a) and toe portions (12b);
 
characterized by a weight pad 

(38) disposed along said side wall (20) in the heel 
portion (12a) of the body (12) rearwardly of said first vertical plane (A) 

and intermediate said hosel (14) and said second vertical plane (B), 
said weight pad (38) providing the golf club head (10) with increased 

resistance to horizontal rotation about a vertical axis that 
extends through the center of gravity (28) when the club head (10) 

impacts a golf ball on the face (24) at off-center points 
(34,36) spaced 

laterally of the sweet spot (28). 
The golf club head (10) of claim 1, wherein said weight pad 
(38) 

weighs between 5 and 15 grams. 
The golf club head (10) of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said 
hollow body (12) is formed of metal. 
The golf club head (10) of claim 3, wherein said hollow body 
(12) 

is formed of stainless steel. 
The golf club head (10) of any preceding claim, wherein said 
weight pad (38) comprises a single weight disposed only in the heel 

portion (12a) of the body. 
The golf club head (10) of claim 5, wherein said side wall (20) 
has a length dimension extending between said front wall (22) and said 

hosel (14), and wherein said weight pad (38) is elongated in a direction 
extending along the length dimension of said side wall (20). 
The golf club head (10) of claim 5 or claim 6, wherein said 
weight pad (38) is divided into two substantially equal parts by a 

third vertical plane (C) which intersects the first (A) and second (B) 
vertical planes at approximately 45 degrees.  

 
The golf club head (10) of claim 6 or claim 7, wherein said 
first (A), second (B) and third (C) planes intersect at a common axis 

(D). 
The golf club head (10) of any preceding claim, wherein said 
top (16), bottom (18) and side (20) walls each have a thickness between 

0.9144 mm and 1.016 mm (0.036 
and 0.040 inch), and wherein said front wall (22) has a thickness 

between 3.2512 mm and 3.429 mm (0.128 and 0.135 inch).
