<CLAIMS>
Oxidation dyes for keratin fibers, more particularly 
human hair, comprising a component A and a component B, 

characterized in that component A contains as oxidation 
dye precursors indoline derivatives corresponding to 

formula I: 

 
in which R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ independently of one another 

represent hydrogen or alkyl groups containing 1 to 4 
carbon atoms or R⁴ and R⁵ together with the oxygen atom to 

which they are attached represent an alkylenedioxy group 
containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms,
 
or salts thereof and in that component B contains at 

least one metal salt with a non-oxidizing anion selected 
from the group consisting of lithium, magnesium, calcium, 

aluminium and zinc salts. 
Oxidation dyes as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that, in the indoline derivatives of formula I present 

in component A, the substituents R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ are 
hydrogen or, optionally, one of these substituents R¹, R², 

R³ is a methyl group and the others are hydrogen. 
Oxidation dyes as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the indolines corresponding to formula I 

or salts thereof are present in component A in a quantity 
of 0.1 to 30 mmoles per 100 g of the dye formulation as 

a whole and in that the metal salts are present in 
component B in a quantity of 0.1 to 50 mmoles and preferably 

in a quantity of 0.3 to 12.5 mmoles per 100 g of the 
dye formulation as a whole.
