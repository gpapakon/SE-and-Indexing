<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cooling apparatus for plastic profiles, with a tank for receiving the cooling medium, through which the profile (7) can be guided, and with a number of guides for calibrating the profile (7), and also with at least one inflow opening (12) and with at least one outflow opening (13) for cooling water. Good cooling with low outlay is achieved by the guides being designed as walls (8) which divide the tank in the longitudinal direction of the profile (7) into a number of sections (11) and these walls (8) having openings (9, 10) for generating a turbulent flow of the cooling water. The invention also relates to a method in which the apparatus can be used advantageously.

Apparatus for cooling plastic profiles, with a trough for 
receiving a cooling medium through which the profile (7) can be 

guided and with several guiding means for calibrating the 
profile (7) as well as with at least one inflow opening (12) 

and with at least one outflow opening (13) for cooling water, 
wherein the guiding means are arranged at least partially 

arranged as seperating walls (8) comprising first openings that 
are aligned, whose shape corresponds the external shape of the 

profile (7) to be calibrated, and through that the profile can 
be guided, and wherein said walls (8) subdivide the trough (11) 

in longitudinal direction of the profile (7) into several 
sections, and wherein said walls (8) comprise at least a 

further opening (9, 10), characterized in that said further 
opening (9, 10) is adapted to generate a turbulent flow of the 

cooling water between two sections of the trough (11), so that 
in the vicinity of the profile (7) a turbulent flow of the 

cooling water is present. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the openings (9, 10) of two adjacent separating walls (8) are 

arranged in a mutually offset manner. 
An apparatus as claimed in one of the claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that some of the openings (9,10) are arranged 

in the region of surface sections of the profile (7) to be 
cooled especially. 
An apparatus as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that some of the openings (9) are arranged as 

recesses between the separating walls (8) and the walls (4) of 
the trough. 
An apparatuus as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the inflow opening (12) is arranged in 

the region of an opening of the trough through which the 
profile (7) exits and that the outflow opening (13) is arranged 

in the region of an opening of the trough through which the 
profile (7) enters the trough.  

 
An apparatus as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that there is provided a device for producing 

a pressure below atmospheric in the trough. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that 
the device for producing the pressure below atmospheric is 

arranged as a self-sucking water pump (14) whose suction nozzle 
is in connection with the outflow opening (13) for cooling 

water. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 7, characterized in that 
additional vacuum pumps (16) are provided for sucking off air 

from the trough. 
Method for cooling plastic profiles, in which the profile 
(7) is guided into a trough filled with a cooling medium and in 

which the profile is guided out therefrom at the other end of 
the trough, wherein the profile (7) is calibrated by guiding 

means arranged in the trough, which are at least partially 
arranged as seperating walls (8) comprising first openings that 

are aligned, whose shape corresponds the external shape of the 
profile (7) to be calibrated and at least a further opening (9, 

10), wherein the cooling medium is fed through an inflow 
opening (12) into the trough and is released by an outflow 

opening (13) from the trough, and whereby the the flow of the 
cooling water is led through several sections formed by the 

walls (8) subdividing the through, characterized in that the 
flow between said sections is led through the further openings 

(9, 10) so that in the vicinity of the profile (7) a turbulent 
flow of the cooling water is present. 
A method as claimed in claim 9, characterized in that the 
turbulent flow is produced by sucking off cooling medium from 

the outflow opening (13). 
A method as claimed in one of the claims 9 or 10, 
characterized in that the flow within the openings of the 

separating walls is provided with Reynolds' numbers which are 
between 5000 and 40000, preferably between 8000 and 25000. The 

Reynolds' number Re is defined by the equation.  
 


Re = d.v/ν 
 
with d being the hydraulic diameter of the opening (9, 10) in 

m, v the mean flow speed in m/s and ν the kinematic viscosity 
of the cooling medium in m
