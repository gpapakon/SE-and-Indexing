<ABSTRACT>
A fuzzy-controlled coding method and apparatus thereof 
wherein quantization step size which is determined by 

values of image complexity, buffer fullness, motion vector 
and picture brightness, is controlled by using a fuzzy 

reasoning and defuzzification, enables properly dealing 
with the case where the conditions which influence a 

quantization step size deviate from the conventional 
algorithm established in a system. 
As a result, the image restored by decoding has a stable 
image quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuzzy-controlled coding
method and apparatus therefor, and more particularly, to
a coding method and apparatus therefor for controlling a
quantization step size which is determined by a state of
buffer for storing a coded image data and a visual
characteristic of the human eye, using a fuzzy control
method.In recent times, a method for digitally encoding an image
video signal and/or audio signal into a digital signal,
transmitting or recording the result, and decoding the
received signal or the reproduced signal has been in wide
use in audio and/or video transceiving systems.In general, methods for coding an image signal include a
transform coding method, a differential pulse code
modulating method, a vector quantization method, and a
variable length coding method. These kinds of methods are
used in order to reduce the total data amount by removing
redundant data from a digital image signal.To perform the above-described coding methods, a screen is
divided into predetermined-sized blocks. Then, transform
operations are performed on each block or a difference
signal between each block, and the image data is converted
into a transform coefficient of frequency domain.Data transform methods for respective blocks include a
discrete cosine transform (DCT) which is the most widely
used, a Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) operation, a
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and a discrete sine
transform (DST) operation. When signal strength is concentrated into the low
frequency domain, resulting from the above described-transform
methods, transform coefficients are changed into
representative values through a quantization process.
Then, the representative values are variable-length-coded,
considering the static characteristics of the
representative values, to thereby compress the data.The human eye is more sensitive to lower frequencies than
to higher frequencies. Therefore, the amount of
transferred data can be further decreased by making the
compression rate of image data in the high frequency
domain relatively larger than that in the low frequency
domain.Figure 1 is a schematic block diagram showing a
conventional coding apparatus for a motion picture image.Referring to Figure 1, NxN sized block image data (a
reference block data) is applied to the input terminal 10.
(Generally, an N1xN2 sized block is applied. However, it
is assumed here that N1=N2.) A predetermined feedback
data is applied to the "-" input terminal of first adder
A1 to be subtracted from the block image data
