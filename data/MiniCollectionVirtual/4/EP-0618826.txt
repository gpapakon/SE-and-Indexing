<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a system of equipment for Tornado game, a new version of football, and it can be used and applied in the sport. The system includes a main goal (1) at each end as well as additional side goals (4) and central goals (3). Devices and connections between them facilitate the distribution to the spectators of information about the course of the game. In this way the system provides additional opportunities for increase of the competitiveness of the game and its attractiveness.

<DESCRIPTION>
 System and equipment for a football type gameThe invention concerns a system of equipment for Tornado game, a new version of football and it can be applied in the sport. It is known the existence of a system of playing equip¬ ment for football required by the laws of existing football [ 1, p.273 and which includes two FT -shaped goals, placed on each goal-line of the field of play and each goal is provided with devices for attachment of a net outside of the field for identification of a scored goal. For measurement of the played time a chronometer carried by the referee is used. In many stadiums in addition to this playing equipment there is information equipment which by no means is connect¬ ed with the playing one. This informεtion equipment is not controlled by the referee and there are variety of designs and functions, but as a matter of rules, there are a clock and a device to show the score. Similar information equip¬ ment is used in other sports and in some of them (basketball, ice hockey) instead of the clock, a chronometer, not control- led by the referee but controlled by a time-keeper, is in¬ stalled. In some sports the time-keeper controls also other additional chronometers for fixed interval of time! for penalty send off (ice hockey, water-polo) , for passing or possession of the ball (basketball) , etc. In the ice hockey as an element of information equipment, related directly to the play, is a red lamp, which is switched on by a goal an who watches whether the puck has crossed the goal-line. Ice hockey and basketball are played in small grounds and direct visual contacts between the referee and the time-keeper areSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 possible and secure for right reading of the chronometers, while the duration of the matches is according to played net time, but not according to astronomic time. In this way in these sports the played time information equipment installed on the information boards is related with the course of game and referee's decisions. In the football the only lawful chronometer is the one used by the referee, and its readings are not shown on the information boards. At the same time in football a time-keeper is not allowed by the Laws of the game. Disadvantages of the known collection of playing and in¬ formation equipment for football are in several directions. The main one is that including only one target (goal) for scoring it limits the variety of effective strategies for further playing actions at any moment of the game, which, at increasing physical capacity of
