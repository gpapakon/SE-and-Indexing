<ABSTRACT>
A method an apparatus of applying a tire tread to a 
tire carcass including the steps of conveying a tread (11) on a 

conveyor (14) between two self-centering guides (34)(35) which are 
slidably mounted on a frame (28) over the conveyor, the guides 

having parallel rows of rollers (36) for engaging opposite 
edges of the treads; adhering one end of the tread to the 

tire carcass on a tire building drum (10); rotating the tire 
building drum to pull the tread over the tire carcass; and 

applying a predetermined uniform pressure against the 
opposite edges of the tire tread through the rollers (36) to 

uniformly resist movement of the tread toward the tire 
building drum and thereby uniformly stretch the tread. 

The apparatus includes the use of a pneumatic piston 
cylinder (44) which urges the rollers against the edges of the 

tread, applying uniform force perpendicular to the tread's 
axis regardless of the width or width variations of the 

tread.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus of applying
an unvulcanized tire tread to an unvulcanized tire carcass during
the tire building process. In the manufacture of radial tires, it
is preferable that the tread be slightly stretched during the
application of the tread to the tire carcass. It is important to
control the stretch in the flat slab of extruded green tire tread
as it is applied to the cylindrical tire carcass. Uniform
stretching of the tread is essential for bending the flat tread
and adhering it properly to the curved surface of the green tire
carcass. If the tread is stretched too little, it will not reach
completely around the tire and if the tread is stretched too much,
the tread will be too long, creating an undesired overlap. Both
of these discrepancies may cause poor tire performance.
Discrepancies in length can be adjusted by the operator in some
cases but this is not desirable.In accordance with one aspect of the invention there is
provided a method of applying a tire tread to a tire carcass
as defined in appended claim 1. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is
provided a method of uniformly stretching a tread along its
length, as described in
appended claim 6.In accordance with still another aspect of the invention
there is provided apparatus for uniformly stretching an
unvulcanized tire tread during its application to a tire carcass,
as defined
in appended claim 3. Fig 1 is a fragmentary plan view of the tire building
apparatus embodying the invention and more specifically shows the
location of the inventive mechanism in relation to the conveyor
and tire building drum and the tread being fed to the drum. Fig 2 is a side elevational view of the tire building
apparatus of Fig 1, more specifically showing the location of the
inventive mechanism in relation to the conveyor and tire building
drum. Fig 3 is an enlarged view of the tread centering apparatus
and constant pressure guiding mechanism according to the
invention. Fig 4 is an end view looking along an axis of a tire tread
as shown in Fig 3 and taken along line 4-4, showing the tire tread
on the conveyor and between the guides of the invention. Fig 5 is a side view of the tire tread and apparatus of Fig
3 taken along line 5-5 in Fig 3.With reference to Figs 1 and 2, a tire building drum 10 is
shown which is usually served by a number of mechanisms which
deliver various tire components to the building drum for assembly
into the finished green tire product. A tire tread 11 is a major
component of the

A method of applying a tire tread (11) to a
tire carcass (16) comprising:


(a) supporting said tread (11) on a conveyor (14)
between two guides (34,35) slidably mounted on a frame

(28) over said conveyor (14);
(b) adhering one end of said tread (11) to said
tire carcass (16) supported on a tire building drum

(10);
(c) pulling said tread (11) over said tire
carcass (10) by rotating said tire building drum (10);

characterized by:
(d) applying a predetermined constantly uniform
force by pneumatic (44) means against said opposite

edges (72,74) of said tread(11) through said guides
(34,35) to uniformly resist movement of said tread (11)

towards said tire building drum (10) regardless of
variation in width of said tread (11) and thereby

uniformly stretch said tread (11) along its length.
The method of claim 1 further characterized by
said pneumatic means comprising at least one pneumatic

piston cylinder assembly (44) for increasing or
decreasing said force against said edges (72,74) of

said tread (11). 
An apparatus (26) for uniformly stretching an
unvulcanized tire tread (11) during its application to

a tire carcass (16), said tread (11) having a length,
edges (72,74) and ends (52,68), said apparatus

comprising a tire building drum (10) for supporting a

tire carcass (16) on said drum (10), characterized by
pressure guides (34,35) positioned at opposite sides of

said tread (11) connected by cables (50,62) for
applying force against said edges (72,74) of said tread
