<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable optical component (1), for example an optical slit having 
adjustable slit width, comprises a movable member (9) for providing an 

optical function, for example a slit (10) and/or a shutter (11), and resilient 
suspension means (5a-5h, 30, 31) for connecting the movable member (9) 

to a frame (12). The essential parts of the movable member, of the resilient 
suspension means and of the frame consist of microstructures which are 

made of a common base material. Preferably, these parts are manufactured 
from a silicon chip by a micromechanical technique comprising, for example, 

anisotropic etching. In the case of an optical slit, the movable member (9) 
comprises a plurality of openings of different widths which constitute a step 

slit (10). In order to adjust different slit widths, the member (9) is moved 
along a line parallel to the center line of the step slit (10), with the force for 

moving the member (9) being applied at opening (13). When the member 
(9) is moved by an external force, the resilient silicon beams (5a-5h) are 

bending and the bars (30, 31) are moving. The movable member (9) has an 
integrated shutter position (11). A high reproducibility of the adjustment of 

the center positions of the openings constituting the step slit (10) during 
repeated movement of the member (9) is ensured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an adjustable optical component, for example an 
optical slit having adjustable slit width. Such a slit is typically used in a 
spectrophotometer for adjusting the width of the entrance slit and/or of the 
exit slit. Most spectrophotometers allow to vary the widths of the entrance slit and 
of the exit slit. The slit width is increased when the amount of light entering 
the spectrophotometer is to be increased, for example in order to improve 
the signal-to-noise ratio. The increase of the slit width, however, has the 
consequence that the spectral resolution of the spectrophotometer is 
deteriorated. On the other hand, the resolution of a spectrophotometer can 
be improved, at the expense of the signal-to-noise ratio, by reducing the slit 
width. There are various prior art solutions for achieving variability of the slit width. 
The simplest approach is to provide a replaceable slit which an operator can 
replace manually by a slit of a different width. This approach is of course 
cumbersome and inflexible so that slits with adjustable widths have been 
developed. A disadvantage of the existing adjustable slits, however, is that 
they are complex and costly. An adjustable slit is known, for example, from 
US-A- 3 394 977. According to this prior art, the entrance slit and the exit 
slit each have a fixed and a movable slit edge, wherein the movable edge 
is moved by means of a resiliently flexible arm. The slit adjustment 
mechanism is designed such that the widths of entrance slit and of the exit  
 
slit are varied simultaneously. The known mechanism comprises a very large 
number of individual parts and is thus very complex, resulting in an increased 
susceptibility to trouble and high cost. Another disadvantage is that the center 
of the slit varies when the slit width is varied because one of the slit edges 
remains fixed. Furthermore, the adjustment of the slit width has to be performed 
manually by an operator. Another adjustable slit system is known from US-A- 3 508 813. This slit system 
comprises a metalized quartz disc in which a plurality of slits of various widths 
are concentrically arranged. Two opposite slits have the same width, 
respectively and thus form a slit pair which serves as entrance slit and exit slit 
of a monochromator. Different slit widths can be selected in discrete steps by 
rotating the disc by a defined angle, respectively. The center of the slit is 
substantially preserved. However, the reproducibility in the adjustment of the 
slit centers
