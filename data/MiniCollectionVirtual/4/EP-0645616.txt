<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns dispersion interferometers for measuring the dispersion component of the refractive index of a 
medium under investigation by an interferometric method. It can be used in the optics industry and as part of the diagnostic 

apparatus used in various plasma systems of the tokamak, stellarator or gas-discharge laser type. The dispersion 
interferometer comprises the following elements arranged along the optical axis: a light source emitting light of a given 

frequency; two non-linear optical frequency doublers the distance between which is such that the object under investigation 
can be accomod
ated between them; a light filter and a recording device. Also included is a polarizing beam splitter. The two 
non-linear optical frequency doublers are oriented in such a way that the directions of polarization of the fast waves are at 

right angles to each other and do not coincide with the directions of polarization which can be separated by the beam splitter 
and light source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dispersion interferometers 
of the type used for measuring the dispersion part of a 
refractive index of media under examination by an interferometric 
method and can be used in the optical industry 
and also in the composition of diagnostic complexes 
of various plasma installations of the type of Tokamak, 
Stallarator, gas discharge lasers. The methods of interferometry make it possible to 
determine a change, necessitated by media, in the optical 
length of a path nS (n - refractive index, 
S - geometric length of the path). Given the length 
of the object under examination, one may conclude about 
the refractive index of a material and vice versa for 
objects with a known refractive index one can register 
the profile of its thickness with an accuracy comparable 
with the wavelength of radiation. If measurements 
are carried out on two different wavelengths λ₁ and 
λ₂, one can determine the dispersion portion of 
the optical length of the path 
[n₁ (λ₁) - 
n₂ (λ₂)] S  
. For example, in plasma the value of 
(n₁ - n₂) is unambiguously associated with electron 
concentration. The common feature of interferometers 
is the provision of two independent optical branches. 
The result of interference depends on the difference of 
wave phases travelling along two branches and converged 
in an interference element. Inasmuch as the wave phase 
in media depends on the geometric path, polarization 
and radiation frequency, we can single out three types 
of interference circuits. In classic interferometers  
 
practised on a large scale, the radiation of a source 
is divided into two waves with equal frequency, which 
travel on different geometric paths in the branches. Very popular are interferometers for plasma diagnostics 
operating simultaneously on two and more wavelengths 
which are constructed according to the classical circuits 
of the first type, say, of Mach-Zender, Michelson, to 
mention only a few (L.N. Pyatnitsky, S.L. Rak, V.A. 
Ron'kin, G.C. Yakushev "Three-frequency high-responsive 
laser interferometer", PTE, 1983, N 5, pp. 181 - 185). 
The difference of geometric paths is a main reason 
behind the defect of such circuits - high response to 
the vibration of optical elements. For elimination of 
a vibration effect, a complex of measures are taken 
which complicate these systems, say, use of vibration-insulating 
bed plates, long-wave radiations (inclusive 
of 337 µm), two longwave interferometers with a compensation 
of vibrations on a shorter wavelength (for 
instance,
