homogeneous or nonhomogeneous liquid mixture of solvent 

and water, the mixture containing substantially pure and 
unsupported 
gamma
-cyclodextrin or its derivatives. Also 
disclosed are methods of further enantiomerically 

enriching solid mixtures obtained from the enantiomer 
separation method and further extracting one enantiomer 

by solvent extraction of the solid mixtures obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The cyclic ketone 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-1(2H)-naphthalenone 
(hereinafter referred to 
as "DCPN") is an important precursor in the formulation 
of an anti-depressant drug. See U.S. Patent 
No. 4,536,518. Enantiomeric resolution of this precursor 
from racemic mixtures is currently limited to analytical 
scale chromatography. However, there is no known process 
for large scale, economical separation of DCPN. The use of cyclodextrins for enantiomeric 
resolution of racemic mixtures of various optically 
active compounds is known. See, for example, Jin et al., 
1 Chirality 137 (1989), which discloses the formation of 
cyclodextrin crystalline inclusion complexes of racemic 
1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl [dansyl] amino acids 
in aqueous solutions of cyclodextrin, followed by precipitation 
of the complex by pH adjustment, and by selective 
recrystallization. However, such a process is suitable 
only for the separation of enantiomers, such as amino 
acids, that have water-ionizable acid groups that may be 
rendered insoluble by the protonation which occurs in an 
acidic pH range. Benschop et al., in Chemical Communica-tions, 
pp 1431-1432 (1970), disclose the partial resolution 
of the liquid enantiomer isopropyl methyl phosphinate 
using beta-cyclodextrin complex formation as one of the 
steps in the resolution. The beta-cyclodextrin was suspended 
in the liquid phosphinate and a trace amount of 
water was added, causing the suspension to solidify into a 
crystalline mass. After 24 hours, the crystalline mass 
was washed with ether, with the ethereal phase containing 
the (+)-enantiomer 17% enriched in optical purity. Such a 
partial resolution has little practical value, however. In general, no method has been devised in the 
art of enantiomeric resolution to predict those chiral  
 
moieties that may be resolved by complexation with cyclodextrins, 
let alone any specific methodology having 
universal application. There are essentially three aspects to the 
present invention. One aspect comprises a method for the 
separation of enantiomers of DCPN comprising the steps of 
contacting the enantiomers thereof with a liquid mixture 
of water and a solvent, the liquid mixture containing 
substantially pure and unsupported gamma cyclodextrin or 
low solubility derivatives thereof (γ-CD), thereby selectively 
binding one of the enantiomers to the γ-CD, and 
separating the enantiomers-γ-CD complex from the liquid 
mixture wherein the enantiomers are soluble in the liquid 
mixture to at least
