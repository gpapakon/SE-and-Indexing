<ABSTRACT>
This barrier is of the type whose arm (4) is integral with a post (3) comprising an internal projection, intended to cover a pillar (2) solidly attached to the ground, this pillar comprising a plurality of chicanes which form a labyrinth in which the projection can be introduced when the post is engaged on the pillar, and from which it cannot be released along the normal pivotal course of the arm. According to the invention, the pillar (2) comprises means (6) for solely axial immobilisation of the post (3), and the means (20) for rotationally linking the post (3) and the pillar (2) when the arm (4) is locked comprise a member capable of suppressing this link, especially capable of breaking, when the barrier is forced, before damage is caused to the pillar structure (2).

Pivoting barrier (1) having a pillar (21) to be fixed to the ground and an 
arm (4) integral with a shaft (3) incorporating an internal projection (10) 

and covering the pillar (2), said pillar (2) having a plurality of baffles 
forming a labyrinth in which the projection (10) can be introduced during the 

engagement of the shaft (3) on the pillar (2) and from which disengagement is 
not possible during the normal pivoting travel of the arm (4), characterized 

in that the pillar (2) incorporates means (6) for the solely axial immobilization 
of the shaft (3) and in that the means (20, 30) for the linking in rotation 

of the shaft (3) and the pillar (2) when the arm (4) is locked comprise 
a member (210) able to eliminate said connection, more particularly by breaking, 

when the barrier is forced, prior to any damage being caused to the 
structure of the pillar (2). 
Pivoting barrier according to claim 1, characterized in that the pillar 

(2) is cylindrical and comprises, at its upper end, a ring (6) projecting outwards 
with respect to its wall and having a radial slot (7), the internal, 

radial lug (10) of the shaft (3), constituting the aforementioned projection, 
being provided and positioned so as to be engageable through the slot (7) and 

below the ring (6) when the shaft (3) is completely engaged on the pillar (2). 
Pivoting barrier according to claim 2, characterized in that the aforementioned 
member which can be broken is constituted by a screw (210) traversing 

the ring (6) and integral with said means (20, 30) for linking in rotation 
the shaft (3) and the pillar (2). 
Pivoting barrier according to claim 3, characterized in that the screw 
(210), after traversing said ring (6), is engaged in a tapped bore of an 

assembly part (207) interchangeably fixed to said means (20, 30). 
Pivoting barrier according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that it comprises means (204, 212) for limiting the pivoting of its arm (4) 

following the breaking of the aforementioned member (210), but still allowing 
the pivoting of the arm (4) in one or other direction in accordance with a 

travel substantially equivalent to the normal opening or closing travel of 
the barrier (1).  

 
Pivoting barrier according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that it comprises a bolt (320) at the free end of its arm (4), actuated by a 

lever (317) extending beyond the shaft (3) and acting on a rod (319) sliding 
within the arm (4), the bolt (320) being engaged in a catch (321) made in a 

pillar (322) located in front of the free end of the arm (4) when the latter 
is in the closing or opening position of the barrier (1). 
Pivoting barrier according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that its shaft (3) comprises a radial tube (340), in which can slide a bolt 

(341) to be engaged in a catch (342) made in a pillar (343). 
Pivoting barrier according to claim 6 or 7, characterized in that it comprises 
means (315, 316; 315, 341a) only allowing the withdrawal of the bolt 

(320, 341) when it is unlocked with the aid of its operating key.
