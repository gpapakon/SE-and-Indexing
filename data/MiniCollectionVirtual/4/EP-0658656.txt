<ABSTRACT>
To improve the quality, durability, installability and ecological safeness of a waterproofing, flexible foundation lining, the flexible or bendable foamed-material layer of a composite of this is compressed with a flexible or bendable plastic layer relative to the foamed state. The thickness of the foamed-material layer (11) when lining the foundation is therefore less than in the finally expanded state of the same.

Flexible, watertight sealing web, which serves as a
watertight covering of foundations (1) of buildings, having

a flexible or bendable layer of foam material (11) which
faces the foundation (1), and a layer of plastics material

(12), which is connected to said layer of foam material and
faces away from the foundation (1), characterised in

that the layer of foam material (11) has a compressed or
compressible foam material, which can be applied to the

foundation (1) for the loose joining thereto, in that the
layer thickness ratio between the layer of foam material

(11) and the layer of plastics material (12) is at least 2,
and in that a soft foam material or resilient foam material

is used for the foam material.
Sealing web according to claim 1, characterised in
that the layer of foam material (11) is compressed to

substantially 15-50 % (relative to the initial thickness
thereof).
Sealing web according to claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the layer of foam material (11) is

formed from soft polyurethane foam based on polyether.
Sealing web according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the layer of foam material

(11) is impregnated with a bitumen-containing agent.
Sealing web according to claim 4, characterised in
that the layer of foam material (11) is impregnated with

bitumen acrylate.
Sealing web according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the layer of plastics

material (12) is formed from an ethylene-butylacrylate
copolymer with bitumen. 
Sealing web according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the layer of foam material

(11) is connected to the layer of plastics material (12) by
means of an intermediate layer of adhesive to form the

composite structure.
Sealing web according to one of claims 1-6,
characterised in that the layer of foam material (11) is

calendered onto the layer of plastics material (12) to form
the composite structure.
Sealing web according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that an edge portion (12a) of the

layer of plastics material (12) protrudes beyond at least
one lateral and/or longitudinal edge of the layer of foam

material (11).
Sealing web according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the ratio of the thickness of

the layer of foam material (11) to the thickness of the
layer of plastics material (12) is between 2 and 24.
