<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of preparing alkyl glycosides by reacting alcohols with monosaccharides, or compounds which form monosaccharides under the reaction conditions, in the presence of amphoteric surface-active agents in the acid form as catalysts, and subsequently neutralizing the reaction mixture with bases.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing alkyl glycosides by 
reacting alcohols with monosaccharides or compounds 

which, under the reaction conditions, form monosaccharides, 
in the presence of acid catalysts, and subsequently 

neutralizing the reaction mixture with bases, wherein 
amphoteric surfactants in the acid form are employed as 

catalysts. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein quaternary 
aminoalkylsulfonates, quaternary aminoalkyl sulfates 

or mixtures thereof are employed as amphoteric 
surfactants. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
alcohols with from 8 to 30 carbons are employed. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
amphoteric surfactants are employed in amounts of from 

0.1 to 5 mol % based on monosaccharides.
