<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure for 
controlling the traversing motion of a 

crane when the length (L) of its hoisting 
cable changes. In the procedure, the traversing 

motion of the crane is controlled 
by using motor acceleration periods (u₁) 

determined on the basis of control commands 
and the length (L) of the hoisting 

cable is measured. According to the 
invention, when the length (L) of the 

hoisting cable changes, at least one 
motor acceleration period (u
k
) proportional 
at least to the hoisting speed 

(L') of the load and to the angular 
velocity (Θ') of the load oscillation is 

generated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a procedure according to the 
preamble of claim 1 for controlling the traversing motion of 
a crane. In this context, traversing motion means both the 
traversing motion of the trolley and the motion of a carriage 
supporting the trolley or other essentially horizontal motion 
used to move an element which has a suspension point for a 
hoisting cable or on which a hoisting drum or equivalent for 
winding up the hoisting cable is installed. A problem in the control of the traversing motion of a load 
suspended from the hoisting cable of a crane is how to damp 
the load oscillation to a minimum. In relevant industry, 
several solutions are known which aim at stopping the load 
without oscillation at its point of destination. For example, 
patent application FI 920751 presents a procedure in which 
the control commands for the travesing motor of the crane are 
so modified that, when the commands are being issued, acceleration 
periods are formed which both implement the control 
commands and compensate the oscillation of the load at the 
end of the traversing motion. This previously known solution makes use of a differential 
equation representing the oscillation of the load is utilized. 
However, for easier practical implementation, it 
employs approximations, which again result in inaccuracies in 
the control methods if the cable length changes during the 
hoisting movement. For this reason, this procedure cannot 
completely compensate the oscillation generated during 
traversal. The object of the present invention is to achieve a procedure 
for controlling a crane whereby the oscillation of the load 
can be compensated even when the oscillation length of the 
hoisting cable changes during traversal. This is implemented 
via the actions defined in the characterization part of claim 
1.  In a manner defined by the invention, the changes in the 
hoisting cable length, which has an effect on the oscillation, 
are taken into account in the control procedure. Therefore, 
the control substantially follows the actual oscillation 
of the load and changes the motor acceleration periods 
accordingly. Even in the case of high hoisting speeds, the 
oscillations can be compensated. With the procedure of the 
invention, the load can be moved without oscillation when the 
hoisting height changes even without speed feedback by using 
acceleration periods determined in the control procedure. 
Deceleration periods are to be understood as corresponding to 
acceleration periods, only the direction
