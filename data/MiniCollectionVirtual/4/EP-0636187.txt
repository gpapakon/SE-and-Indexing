<ABSTRACT>
Nucleic acid sequence hybridizing specifically with a Campylobacter jejuni genomic nucleic acid sequence selected from nucleotidic sequence SEQ ID no. 1, nucleotidic sequence SEQ ID no. 2, complementary sequences thereof, and sequences which differ from these by mutation, insertion, deletion or substitution of one or more bases, and do not or hardly hybridize with the nucleic acids of other Campylobacter bacteria. Fragments of this sequence can be used as specific primers for the amplification of Campylobacter jejuni specific sequences and as specific nucleic probes of Campylobacter jejuni nucleic sequences. The invention also refers to a method of detecting the presence of Campylobacter jejuni strains in a biological sample, and a kit for carrying out said method.
