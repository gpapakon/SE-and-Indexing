<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel process for preparing 
1,5-benzothiazepine derivatives represented by the 
formula: 
   wherein one of R¹ and R² is a lower alkyl group or 
halogen atom, and the other is hydrogen, R³ is a 
lower alkyl group or a lower alkoxy group. The above 1,5-benzothiazepine derivatives (I) are useful 
as an intermediate for the synthesis of, for example, the 
corresponding 3-acetoxy-5-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1,5-benzothiazepine 
derivatives having excellent hypotensive 
activity. Heretofore, as a process for preparing 1,5-benzothiazepine 
derivatives (I), the method in which a propionic acid 
derivatives represented by the formula:     wherein R⁴ represents hydrogen atom or an ester 
residue, and R¹, R² and R³ have the same meanings 
as defined above,
 
is heated in a solvent (for example, xylene) to effect 
intramolecular ring closing has been known (U.S. Patents 
No. 4,567,175 and No. 4,590,188). However, this method 
involves the problem of requiring a long period of time 
for the intramolecular ring closing reaction. The present inventors have studied various research and as 
a result, they have found that, when the intramolecular 
ring closing reaction of the compound (II) is carried out 
in the presence of a specific sulfonic acid compound, the 
compound (I) can be prepared by the reaction within a 
short time with good yield. The present invention has 
been established based on such findings. That is, according to the process of the present invention, 
the 1,5-benzothiazepine derivatives represented by the 
formula (I) can be prepared by subjecting a propionic acid 
derivative represented by the formula (II): 
   wherein R¹, R², R³ and R⁴ have the same meanings as 
defined above,
 
to intramolecular ring closing reaction in the presence of 
a sulfonic acid compound represented by the formula (III):

R⁵SO₃H   (III)


 
   wherein R⁵ represents a lower alkyl group or a substituted 
or unsubstituted phenyl group. Examples of the sulfonic acid compound (III) to be used in 
the intramolecular ring closing reaction of the present 
invention include, for example, the compounds wherein R⁵ 
in the formula (III) is an alkyl group having 1 to 4 
carbon atoms such as methyl group, ethyl group, propyl 
group or butyl group or a phenyl group which may be substituted 
by at least one of these alkyl groups, and particularly, 
methanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid is 
preferably used. An amount of the said sulfonic acid is 
not particularly limited but generally it is preferably 
us
