<ABSTRACT>
By compressing HDTV pictures, they can be recorded on digital SDTV 
video recorders. Such recorders are widely used in professional studios. The invention 

relates to a device for formatting the compressed HDTV signal in such a way that the 
DC values of successive 8*8 picture blocks are processed by SDTV recorders as a 

smaller but recognizable SDTV sub-picture. Low-cost editing of HDTV programs with 
standard equipment (SDTV recorders and receivers) is possible with such a device, 

while the edited final result can be transmitted as a HDTV signal without any further 
processing operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for transmitting a digital picture signal.
More particularly, the invention relates to a device provided with encoding means for
forming a mean value and a series of other data words of successive picture blocks of
the picture signal. Transmission of picture signals is also understood to mean recording
and reproducing the signals. The invention also relates to a device for receiving a digital
picture signal.Devices of the type described in the opening paragraph for transmitting a
high-definition (HDTV) picture signal are generally known. By means of, for example
picture transform and coding of coefficients obtained therefrom it has been found
possible to compress HDTV picture signals to a considerably lower bit rate than would
be necessary for the uncompressed picture signal. Such devices will in due course
provide the possibility of realizing HDTV video recorders having technically and
economically feasible specifications as regards their electrical and mechanical aspects
and as regards the use of tapes. Video recorders for recording, editing and display of
digital picture signals having a lower standard definition (SDTV) are, however, already
produced in large quantities. For example, professional PCM video recorders which can
record and play back an uncompressed digital SDTV picture signal are still available in
large quantities and to an increasing extent. Also in the future, they will be considerably
cheaper than HDTV recorders for a long time.Various coding schemes have been proposed for transmission of HDTV
signals with high compression rates and minimal loss of picture quality.
In Rundfunktechnische Mitteilungen, vol. 36, no.5, pages 196-205, a coding scheme is
discussed which combines several techniques, such as Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT), variable length coding and temporal prediction based on full-search
blockmatching between successive frames.
In IEEE International Conference on Communications ICC 90, Conference record, 
pages 1049-1053, a network architecture is described for high quality HDTV
transmission using an ATM network. A picture coding scheme based on a sub-band
DCT algorithm is proposed.
In Signal Processing: Image Communication, vol.4, no.3, pages 195-225, a number of
strategies for hierarchical coding of HDTV signals are investigated. Hierarchical coding
enables efficient transmission of pictures in both HDTV and SDTV format, by
decomposing the HDTV signal into a SDTV signal and a HDTV complement signal.
The latter signal enables
