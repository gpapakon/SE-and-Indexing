<ABSTRACT>
A permanent-magnet voltage generator for supplying 
voltage to the ignition system of an internal-combustion 

engine. The voltage generator comprises a rotor unit 
(10) provided with an air fan (14) and a stator core 

(11) having at least one voltage generating coil (28') 
facing the rotor unit (10). The rotor unit (10) 

comprises a magnetically conductive bar element (12) 
diametrically extending and provided with a central hub 

(15) for connection to the shaft of the engine. The bar 
element (12) comprises a permanent magnet (21) arranged 

between between a pair of pole shoes (17,18) 
longitudinally extending on one side of the hub (15), 

and a balancing portion (25,see Fig.4) 
longitudinally extending on 

the opposite side of the bar (12). The two pole shoes 
(17,18) and the body portion of the bar element (12) on 

one side of the hub (15) define on a side a first open 
magnetic circuit facing the magnetic circuit of the 

stator which is fed with a portion (F1,see Fig.4) of the magnetic 
flux to generate the voltage in the stator coil (28'), 

and a second closed magnetic circuit (F2,see Fig.4), on the other 
side, supplied under saturation conditions with the 

remaining portion of the permanent magnet flux.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a permanent-magnet 
voltage generator, or magneto generator, for 
generating voltages to supply the ignition systems of 
internal-combustion engines; in particular, the 
invention concerns a magneto generator particularly 
suitable for small single-cylinder engines which are 
used in manually operated machines, such as motor-driven 
saws, strimmers, mowers and other similar 
applications where the cost, dimensions and weight of 
the magneto generator may limit the use of the same 
generator as well as the machine. As is known, many manually operated machines which 
are driven by a low-power combustion engine, 
generally a single-cylinder engine, are provided with 
an ignition system supplied by a special voltage 
generator. The voltage generators for the applications of the 
abovementioned kind, in general consist of a rotor 
unit having permanent magnet means and designed to be  
 
connected to the shaft of the engine, and a stator 
unit comprising a magnetic core provided with two or 
three pole legs and at least one voltage generating 
coil which are facing the magnetic circuit of the 
rotor for generation of the voltages to supply the 
ignition system of the engine; the rotor unit in 
general comprises magnetic flux generating means for 
excitation of the stator coil, as well as an air fan 
generating an air flow for cooling the engine. In the field of voltage magneto generators for 
single-cylinder engines, in general fully cast 
aluminium rotors have been proposed as the best 
compromise in terms of price, performance, lightness 
and mechanical strength. In those applications where 
manual operation of a machine is envisaged for long 
periods, low weight of the rotor together with high 
mechanical strength assume particular importance, for 
the same price and other performance features of the 
generator. The use of aluminium castings for the manufacture of 
the rotors, even though it results in relatively 
light structures and high mechanical strength, with 
comparatively acceptable costs compared to other  
  
 
solutions, nevertheless involves an extremely complex 
manufacturing process on account of the need to 
position beforehand various separate parts of the 
magnetic circuit and/or the structure of the rotor in 
a mould, before casting the aluminium, with a 
consequent increase in costs and practical 
impossibility of reducing the weight of the generator 
below a limit which is still considered to be too 
high. Other permanent-magnet voltage generators 
are
