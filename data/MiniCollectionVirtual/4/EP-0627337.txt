Seat for a vehicle, of the type intended to be used with 
a safety belt able to assume an active position in which it is 

capable of retaining an occupant on his seat by means of a strap 
(S), and of the type comprising a squab (10) with a cushion (11) 

supported by a frame (12) mounted on a base (14) and a back (20) 
with a cushion (21) supported by a frame (22), the squab frame 

(12) supporting means (G) forming an anchoring point (A) for 
retaining the strap (S) of the belt, the squab (10) being mounted 

to rotate on the base (14), the frame (12) of the cushion (11) 
of the squab (10) being mounted on the base (14) by the 

interposition of a turntable (13) in order that the cushion (11) 
of the squab (10) is able to rotate about an axis (130) between 

a normal position and a turned position for access, in addition 
the seat comprising locking means (40) for immobilising the 

cushion (11) of the squab (10) in its normal position and for 
retaining the safety belt in its active position, characterised 

in that the squab (10) is mounted to rotate on the base (14) 
independently of the back (20) and in that said locking means 

(40) comprise an anchoring support (41) integral in rotation with 
the frame (12) of the squab supporting, on the one hand, means 

(G) forming an anchoring point (A), and on the other hand, first 
releasable means (411) for attaching this support (41) to the 

base (14) cooperating with second complementary attachment means 
(421) connected to this base. 
Seat according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises a force-absorbing mechanism (70) interposed between, 

on the one hand, the frame (12) of the squab cushion (11) namely 
a movable member (132) of the turntable (13) and, on the other 

hand, the base (14) namely the floor on which the seat rests. 
Seat according to one of Claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the locking means (40) are put into operation to 

automatically immobilise the cushion (11) of the squab (10) in 
its normal position and automatically retain the safety belt in  

 
its active position when the cushion (11) of the squab (10) 

adopts its normal position. 
Seat according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
locking means (40) are put out of operation manually in order to 

release the cushion (11) of the squab (10) and in order to 
release the safety belt from its active position. 
Seat according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
locking means (40) are put out of operation automatically in 

order to release the cushion (11) of the squab (10) from its 
normal position and in order to release the safety belt from its 

active position. 
Seat according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the means forming the anchoring point (A) comprise a keeper 

(G) for a belt buckle. 
Seat according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the first attachment means comprise an opening forming a 

keeper (411) provided in the anchoring support (41) and in that 
the second attachment means comprise a latch (421) biased 

elastically into the locked position in the keeper (411) of the 
support (41). 
Seat according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that it comprises a return device (50) tending to place the 

cushion (11) of the squab (10) in at least one of its two 
positions, namely normal position and turned position for access. 
Seat according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in 
that it comprises a servo control (60) associated with the 

locking means (40) for ensuring the operation thereof in 
particular the deactivation thereof at the time of the operation

equipped with a safety belt having three anchorage points (A), 
characterised in that the anchorage point (A) of the strap (S) 

placed on the frame (12) of the cushion (11) of the squab (10) 
permanently retains the strap (S), and in that the two other 

anchorage points (A) which are opposed thereto relative to the 
seat, for respectively defining the abdominal band and the 

thoracic band of the strap of the belt are mounted to move in two 
areas which are separate and remote from a corresponding part in 

order to form a belt of the so-called "passive" type.
