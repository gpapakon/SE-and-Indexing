<DESCRIPTION>
 A FACILE ENZYMATIC SYNTHESIS OF GALACTOSYL-BETA-1,3 GLYCALSDescriptionTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to the synthesis of Lea and sialyl Lea and analogs thereof, and more particularly to the synthesis of a galactosylJl,3glycal that is a galactosidase inhibitor and is also an intermediate that can be used in the syntheses of Lea, sialyl Lea and analogs thereof.Background ArtDisaccharides possessing a βl ,3-linkage are important core units in the blood group determinants, tumor associated antigens, and the ligands of adhesion molecules. [Hakomori, Adv. Cancer Res.. j>2.:257 (1981);Fenzi, Nature, 314:53 (1985); Berg et al., J. Biol.Che .. 266:14869 (1991); Hodgson, Biotechnology. £:609(1991)]. For example, Lea and Sialyl Lea incorporate the Type I (Gal3l,3GlcNAc) subunit (shown below) in its structure. [Fenzi, Nature, 314:53 (1985)]. 
LeaSialylLeaThese types of compounds and their derivatives or analogs are important tools for the study of cell- cell interactions and have been the objects of synthetic effort. [Wong et al., J. Carbohvdr. Chem.. £:745 (1990); Sabesan et al.. Can. J. Chem.. 6_2.:644 (1984); Jacquinet et al.. Tetrahedron Lett.. 2_2:15, 1387 (1981)]. However, chemical syntheses require many protecting group manipulations in order to obtain the desired regioselectivity.Although no 31,3-linkage forming glycosy1transferases have been isolated, glycosidases [Nilsson, Trends Biotechnol.. (5:256 (1988), and references therein; Toone et al.. Tetrahedro . 45:5365 (1989); Cote et al., Glvcoconiugate J.. 2:145 (1990); David et al.. Adv. Carbohvdr. Biochem.. 49_:175 (1991)] previously have been used to form ,61,3-linked disaccharides through the use of less readliy available enzymes [Hedbys et al., Glvconconiugate J. , .6:161 

(1989)] and by the manipulation of the anomeric protecting group of the acceptor species. [Nilsson, Trends biotechnol.. .6256 (1988)].Glycals have been examined by Leh ann et al. [Brockhaus et al., J. Carbohvdr. Res.. 5.2:21 (1977);Lehmann et al., Carbohydr. Res.. 5_8:65 (1977); Lehmann et al., Carbohydr. Res.. 58.:72 (1977)] in glycosidase- mediated coupling reactions. Those investigators determined that glucal in the presence of e ulsin 3-glucosidase forms 2-deoxy-Glu/31,3-glucal in up to 50 percent yield. In addition, incubation of D-galactal in the presence of glycol or water and /9-galactosidase formed the corresponding glycosides via addition across the double bond. D-Glucal was reported to react similarly in the presence of yS-glucosidase.Lehmann [Brockhaus et
