<ABSTRACT>
The compounds are vesamicol (hydroxylated phencyclidine(PCP) isomer trans-2-(4-phenyl-piperidino)cyclohexanol) derivatives with anticholinergic properties termed herein "azavesamicols" in which the cyclohexyl group of vesamicol is replaced with a heterocycle of similar size, the piperidyl ring. The coumpounds bind to the vesamicol receptor, a cytoplasmically-oriented site on the cholinergic synaptic vesicle, which is associated with the vesicular transporter of acetylcholine.

 AZAVESAMICOLSBackground of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to vesamicol derivatives that have anticholinergic properties.2. Description of the Related ArtThe vesamicol receptor, a cytoplasmically-oriented site on the cholinergic synaptic vesicle, is associated with the vesicular transporter of acetylcholine (reviewed by Marshall and Parsons, 1987). The location of this receptor provides opportunities for the investigation of presynaptic cholinergic phenomena associated with the release and/or storage of acetylcholine.The prototypical vesamicol receptor ligand 2-(4-phenylpiperidinyl)cyclohexanol (l,vesamicol,AH5183) exhibits nanomolar affinity for this receptor (Bahr and Parsons, 1986). However, vesamicol also exhibits significant alpha-adrenoceptor activity (Estrella et al., 1988), an attribute which limits its usefulness in the study of presynaptic cholinergic function. In an earlier structure- activity study (Rogers et al., 1989), the vesamicol analogs 2a, 2b and 3 were identified as potent ligands for this receptor. In addition to providing new insights into the topography of the vesamicol receptor, these novel analogs also represent lead structures for developing a new generation of potent and selective ligands for this receptor.Although 2b, a pseudo-irreversible ligand, has been used as a lead for developing a number of potentially useful ligands (Jung et al. , 1990;Kilbourn et al., 1990), the full implications accompanying the activity of 3 have yet to be realized.In U.S. Patent 4,522,965 which issued November 12, 1985 to Stanley M. Parsons, a vesamicol derivative is described for use in blocking conduction at the neuromuscular junction in mammals. Parsons notes that it is desirable to produce a more effective compound than vesamicol for blocking presynaptic release of acetylcholine.In an earlier study, Rogers et al. (1989) noted that the vicinal aminoalcohol functionality was essential for vesamicol-like anticholinergic activity.Furthermore, these authors showed that benzo fused analogs like 2a and 2b were potent inhibitors of vesicular ACh transport. In contrast, those analogs which lacked a cyclohexyl moiety (e.g. 4a,4b) were found to exhibit substantially diminished activity. 

 In a subsequent study, we demonstrated that potent noncyclohexyl- containing vesamicol analogs could be obtained by attaching arylethyl substituents onto 4a. Case in point, compound 4c was found to be 59 times more potent than 4a.Vesamicol has the ability to inhibit both the uptake of ACh
