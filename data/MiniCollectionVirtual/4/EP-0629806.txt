A refrigerant coupling to connect refrigerant lines, in particular for use in 
motor vehicles, with two pipe connectors, one designed as a male 

attachment and the other as a female attachment, which can be inserted one 
into the other and sealed by means of at least one sealing element, and 

which can be secured axially by means of a locking arrangement in a 
connected position in which the male attachment is centred inside the female 

attachment by means of a bush made of a non-conductive material which 
can be inserted inside the female attachment and held at a radial distance 

from the female attachment, whereby the male attachment has an outward 
protruding, ring-shaped collar which rests axially against the bush in order 

to limit the extent to which the male attachment is inserted,
characterised in that
 the bush (7) is of a dimensionally stable 
design and extends the entire length of the ring-shaped area along which the 

male attachment (3) is inserted into the female attachment (4), that the 
external circumference of the bush (7) can fit tightly in a non-positive 

connection into a receiving area of the female attachment (4) and that the 
internal circumference of the bush (7) is provided with at least two axially 

offset, circumferential sealing elements (12a, 12b) to encompass the male 
attachment (3) tightly in a non-positive connection. 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the external and internal circumferences of 
the bush (7) are each provided with two axially offset ring grooves (26; 27) 

into which are inserted elastic packing rings (12a, 12b, 12c, 12d).  
 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the locking arrangement is provided with a 
locking ring (5) which is held on to the female attachment (4) by means of 

an axial, positive connection and in which a locking clamp (6, 6a, 31, 31a, 
31b), which can be opened radially for the axial insertion and removal ofthe 

male attachment (3) and which blocks the male attachment (3) in the female 
attachment (4) in the inserted position axially in a positive connection, is 

fixed in such a manner that it cannot be lost. 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with Claim 3,
characterised in that
 t the locking ring (5) consists of two shells 
(15, 16) which can be connected together in such a way that they can be 

separated. 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with Claim 4,
characterised in that
 the locking clamp (31, 31a, 31b) is 
designed as a spring lock washer with a closed cross section which encloses 

the male attachment (3) when fitted and which rests on an inner wall of the 
locking ring (5) and has at least one engaging element (33, 35, 36) 

accessible from the outside ofthe locking ring (5) to open the locking clamp 
(31, 31a, 31b). 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with Claim 5,
characterised in that
 two engaging pins (33, 35) which protrude 
radially outwards through the wall of the locking ring (5) are located on 

opposite sides of the spring lock washer (31, 31a) as engaging elements. 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with Claim 6,
characterised in that
 a shell-shaped removal tool (30) is 
provided which can be placed on the locking ring and which is provided 

with two radially inward protruding cams (34) at the level of the engaging 
pins (33) to open the spring lock washer (31).  

 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with Claim 7,
characterised in that
 the removal tool (30) is provided with a 
wedging edge (25) to secure the male attachment (3) axially in a positive 

connection during removal which protrudes radially inwards past the radial 
height of a protective collar (11) on the male attachment (3) a
nd is 
positioned at an axial distance from the protective collar (11) during 

removal when placed in position. 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with Claim 8,
characterised in that
 the axial distance between the protective 
collar (11) and the wedging edge (25) is smaller than the axial length of the 

bush (7). 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the locking arrangement for the connection 
between the male attachment (3) and the female attachment (4) has a 

positive anti-twist locking device (21, 22) in a defined position. 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 t the two shells (15, 16) can be connected 
on one side by means of a hinge connection in such a manner that they can 

be closed to form a ring by means of a snap-in connecting device (18) on 
the opposite side. 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with Claim 11,
characterised in that
 the hinged connector (17) has at least two 
engaging elements which can be snapped together in a positive connection 

and which can be pivoted in relation to one another, one of which is 
positioned on each ofthe shells (15, 16).  

 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the locking clamp is designed essentially as 
a U-shaped, elastically opening stirrup. 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with Claim 10,
characterised in that
 the U-shaped stirrup is provided with a 
recess (38) which serves as an engaging surface for a tool. 
A refrigerant coupling in accordance with one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that
 the locking clamp (6) is held inserted in the 
locking ring (5) and the free ends of the U-shaped stirrup of the locking 

clamp (6) are accessible through two openings (19) in the locking ring (5) 
by means of a tool.
