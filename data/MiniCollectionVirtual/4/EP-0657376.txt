<ABSTRACT>
A method for selectively binding pre-personalized 
inserts (21) into book type publications such as magazines, 

newspapers, and catalogs as well as books themselves, the steps 
of providing batches of pre-personalized inserts and other 

inserts, providing a binding line equipped with a selective 
binding control system (23), providing a sequential feed for 

pre-personalized inserts to the binding line along with a 
diverter and introducer for other inserts into specific books.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for selectively 
binding pre-personalised inserts and, more particularly, to such 
inserts as signatures, mailers, cards and the like. It has become very popular to be able to create several 
different versions of a book (i.e., magazine, newspaper, 
catalog, book itself, etc.) at the same time, to save on postal 
charges and to direct advertising at specific individuals. For 
instance, a clothing store may want to provide different 
catalogs based on the customer's gender. In conventional 
binding, each type of catalog would have to be bound on separate 
bindery lines, thus creating two mailings. In the inventive 
selective binding, both catalogs are created at the same time on 
the sage bindery line. The men's clothing and women's clothing 
pages are loaded into separate feeders on the bindery line. A  
 
control computer examines each recipient for gender and directs 
the bindery line to actuate the proper feeders to create the 
desired catalog. This is known as selective binding. To date, the only type of personalization of 
selectively bound books has been ink jet printing at the time 
the book is bound. Ink jet printing is limited in print 
quality, number of lines of variable data that can be printed on 
a page, lack of ability to print graphics, and the ability to 
print on interior plies of a sealed insert. Patents such as 
4,789,149 and 4,768,766 and 4,121,818 and 3,917,252 and 
3,899,165 disclose selective binding systems that include ink 
jet personalization. Pre-personalization (i.e., off-line 
personalization) on the other hand allows for personalized 
information on both sides of a sheet covering the entire sheet. 
It also provides the possibility to personalize interior plies 
of sealed mailer type constructions, and very high print 
quality. Previous attempts at including pre-personalized 
signatures in books, such as patents 5,143,362 and 5,114,128 
were limited in that these methods did not allow for the 
selective binding of the pre-personalized signature itself. In 
these patents all recipients would receive a pre-personalized 
signature. According to the present method, pre-personalized 
signatures would be able to be selectively bound in a book. 
Based on pre-selected demographics, only selected recipients 
would receive a pre-personalized insert. This enables 
advertisers to direct these special inserts at a specific group 
of individuals.  In the '362 and '128 patents the pre-personalized 
signature controls the bindery line. Each signature's

<CLAIMS>
In a method for selectively binding 
pre-personalized inserts into books, characterized by the steps 

of 
   providing a batch (13, 21) of pre-personalized inserts, 

   providing a binding line (19, 28) equipped with a 
selective binding control system (23) and production database, 

   providing means (20) for sequentially feeding 
pre-personalized inserts from said batch to said binding line, 

   providing means (22, 26, 28) operatively associated 
with said feeding means for inhibiting said feeding means, for 

diverting inserts from said feeding means, and 
   operating said binding line to form books while 

inserting a pre-personalized insert into a specific book. 
The method of claim 1 in which said steps include 
providing a batch of other inserts, 

   equipping said operatively associated means with means 
for introducing other inserts into said binding line, and 

   operating said binding line to form books while 
inserting a pre-personalized insert into a specific book and 

other inserts into at least some of the other books. 
The method of claim 2 in which said steps include 
upon appearance of a malfunction, substituting a generic insert 

for a pre-personalized insert. 
The method of claim 3 in which said step of 
providing a binding line includes providing a single pocket for 

each of said pre-personalized inserts and said generic inserts. 
The method of claim 3 in which said step of 
providing a binding line includes providing a separate pocket 

for each of said pre-personalized inserts and said generic 
inserts. 
The method of claim 2 in which the step of 
providing other inserts includes providing generic inserts. 
The method of claim 2 in which said step of 
providing other inserts includes providing inserts of a gender 

different from the gender of said pre-personalized inserts. 
The method of claim 1 in which said steps include 
providing means operatively associated with said feeding means 

for culling inserts from said feeding means and for introducing 
generic inserts into said binding line, 

   operating said binding line to form books while 
inserting a personalized insert into a specific book according 

to said database except: 

(a) if the currently sensed insert has an equal or 
lower number insert than the previously sensed insert, divert 

it; 
(b) if a misfeed occurs, divert one insert; 
(c) if the next insert to feed has a higher number than 
that requested by the binding control system, inhibit the feed 

of inserts; 
(d) if the next insert to feed has a smaller number 
than that requested by the binding line control system, cull the 

insert; 
(e) if the personalized feed is inhibited, feed a 
generic insert; 
(f) if the sensed insert is a lower numbered insert 
than that requested by the binder line control system, divert 

the inset; and 
(g) if the number for an insert requested by the binder 
line control system contains an alpha character, inhibit the 

feed. 
The method of claim 8 in which if the cull step 
includes dropping the insert on the floor, then feeding a 

generic insert. 
The method of claim 8 in which if the cull step 
includes feeding the lower numbered insert into a book, then 

removing the book at the end of the binding line.
