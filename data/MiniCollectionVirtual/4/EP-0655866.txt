<ABSTRACT>
In a device which is supplied with a compression 
coded signal given by subjecting an original video signal 

to differential coding and which includes a converting 
section (10, 8, 7, 6) for carrying out a converting 

operation of converting the compression coded signal into a 
DCT coded signal identical with a coded signal given by 

subjecting the original video signal to DCT coding, a timer 
(3) measures a total time interval as a measured time 

interval until a reproducing unit (20) finishes reproducing 
from the DCT coded signal a leading frame of the original 

video signal from a time instant at which the converting 
section starts the converting operation. A subsampling 

information producing circuit (13) produces optimum 
subsampling information with reference to the measured time 

interval to make the converting section carry out an 
optimum subsampled converting operation of converting 

remaining frames of the compression coded signal into the 
DCT coded signal in accordance with the optimum subsampling 

information. Preferably, the subsampling information 
producing circuit compares the measured time interval with 

a predetermined time interval and produces, when the 
measured time interval is greater than the predetermined 

time interval, first subsampling information as the optimum 
subsampling information to make the converting section 

carry out a simplified subsampled converting operation as 
the optimum subsampled converting operation in accordance 

with the first subsampling information.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a video conversion
device supplied with a compression coded signal given by
subjecting an original video signal to differential
coding. The video code conversion device is for
converting the compression coded signal into a DCT
(discrete cosine transform) coded signal identical with a
coded signal given by subjecting the original video
signal to DCT coding. The video code conversion device
is for use in combination with a reproducing unit which
reproduces the original video signal from the DCT coded
signal.When an image is digitized and recorded in a
recording medium such as a CD-ROM (Compact Disk Read Only
Memory) and a hard disk, the image is generally
compressed into a compressed signal to be recorded so
that an amount of produced data is not enormously large.Among various compression coding systems, a DCT
coding system is frequently used and is adopted in an
international standard coding system such as JPEG (Joint
Photographic Expert Group) and MPEG (Moving Pictures
Expert Group). The DCT coding system produces a DCT 
coded signal given by subjecting an original video signal
to DCT coding. A differential coding system, in which
processing is relatively simple, is also frequently used
although it is not an international standard. The
differential coding system produces a compression coded
signal given by subjecting the original video signal to
differential coding.Thus, there are international standards such as
the JPEG and the MPEG as the DCT coding system.
Accordingly, reproduction is possible by any reproducing
unit which is based on the international standard.
However, inverse DCT or inverse quantization processing
imposes a large load upon a CPU (central processing
unit). This means that high-speed reproduction can not
be carried out unless the CPU is operable at a high
speed. On the other hand, in the differential coding
system, the load imposed upon the CPU is small because
calculation of the differential values alone is required.
Even with a low-speed CPU, high-speed reproduction is
possible. However, there are many kinds of differential
coding systems because no standard exists. This means
that reproduction can not be carried out unless a
specific reproducing unit specific to each system is
used.Instead of providing such a specific reproducing
unit for each of various differential coding systems, it
is proposed to transform the compression coded signal
representative of differential codes into the DCT coded 
signal representative of DCT codes so that reproduction
is
