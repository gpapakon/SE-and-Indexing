Method for controlling an anti-glare device
which is fitted with a filter disc (3), which can be

controlled electrically with reference to its optical
transmission, and with an electronic control unit (10),

which is operationally connected to said filter disc
and comprises a light-sensitive sensor (8), with the

aim of varying the dimension of the optical
transmission of the filter disc (3) inversely with

respect to the intensity of the light failing on the
sensor (8), the light sources detected by the sensor

(8) being imaged on the exposed surface of the sensor
(8), and the intensity of the incident light being

selectively measured by means of a multiplicity of
surface elements (15) of the sensor surface,

characterized in that the currently highest measuring
signal is selected and evaluated for the purpose of

uniform control of the optical transmission of the
entire filter disc (3).
Anti-glare device for carrying out the method

according to Claim 1, having a filter disc (3), which
can be controlled electrically with reference to its

optical transmission, and an electronic control unit
(10) which is operationally connected to said filter

disc and comprises a light-sensitive sensor (8), it
being the case that means are provided for imaging the

light sources in the space monitored by the sensor on
the exposed surface of the sensor, and that the light-sensitive

sensor (8) has a multiplicity of optoelectric 
transducer elements (15) which are arranged in a

surface-area grid and have separately detectable output
signals, characterized in that the electronic control

unit (10) has a circuit arrangement for selecting the
currently highest of the output signals arriving at the

transducer elements (15) for the uniform control of the
optical transmission of the entire filter disc (3).
Anti-glare device according to Claim 2,

characterized in chat at least a part of the electronic

control unit (10) forms a subassembly with the light-sensitive
sensor (8).
Anti-glare device according to Claims 4 and 5,
characterized in that the circuit elements of the

circuit arrangement which are assigned individually to
the optoelectric transducer elements (15) are

constructed together with the optoelectric transducer
elements (15) on a common semiconductor wafer in order

to select the highest output signal.
Anti-glare device according to one of Claims 2
to 6, characterized in that connected upstream of the

light-sensitive sensor (8) is an imaging optical system
(9) which images the light sources in the space

monitored by the sensor on the exposed surface of the
sensor (8).
Anti-glare device according to one of Claims 2
to 7, characterized in that a filter for optical

radiation is connected upstream of the light-sensitive
sensor (8).
Anti-glare device according to one of Claims 2
to 8, characterized in that solar cells (6, 7) are

provided for supplying power to the anti-glare device.
