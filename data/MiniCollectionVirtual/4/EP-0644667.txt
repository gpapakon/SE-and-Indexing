<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
system for detecting trouble in a single-fiber two-way
optical transmission. Recently, two-way optical
transmission through a single optical fiber by using
optical signals of the same or different wave lengths,
is being developed in order to increase the amount of
information transmitted through a single fiber. However,
conventional methods for detecting trouble used in
single-fiber one-way transmission, cannot be used in
single-fiber two-way optical transmission.In the conventional single-fiber one-way
transmission system, two-way transmission between two
opposite optical terminal stations can be performed
through at least two optical fibers in opposite
directions. In such a system, the detection of trouble
is carried out by monitoring at each optical terminal
station the level of an optical signal transmitted
through the optical fiber directed to the optical
terminal station and received at the optical terminal
station, and transmitting to the opposite optical
terminal station an alarm signal for informing detection
of trouble when an abnormality (failure) in the level of
the optical signal is detected.However, in the single-fiber two-way optical
transmission systems, when trouble or abnormalities such as a break in
the optical fiber occur , an optical signal transmitted
from an optical terminal station may be reflected at the
point of the break, and then may be received by the
optical terminal station which has transmitted the
optical signal. Namely, in the single-fiber two-way 
optical transmission systems, trouble occurring in optical
fibers may not be able to be detected by each optical
terminal station by monitoring the level of the optical
signal received at the optical terminal station.Document EP-A-0 368 282 refers to a bidirectional optical
transmission system having a light-interruption detection
function. The bidirectional optical system comprises
transmitting and receiving stations at each end with a
facility for detecting defective operation, particularly
cross-talk. A discrimination regarding the origin of the
received signal is made by superimposing a detection signal
of different frequency on the transmission signal and
detecting this detection signal by identifying its frequency.An object of the present invention is to provide a method and
system for detecting trouble in single-fiber two-way optical
transmission, which is not affected by reflection at a break
point of an optical fiber.According to the first aspect of the present invention,
