<ABSTRACT>
The process according to the invention makes it possible to obtain a semifinished product in the form of a strip having a homogeneous microstructure and a green density at least equal to 55% of the theoretical density, this semifinished product being able to be densified at a temperature below the temperatures usually required. According to this process, a slip of the powder intended to form the matrix is cast, in strip form, by means of a shoe (11), onto fibres (8) which are arranged on a plate (6) and stretched between two combs (7), the slip and the surface of the fibres exhibiting chemical affinity.

Process for the preparation of a green body in 
strip form usable for the manufacture of composite 

materials with fibre-reinforced ceramic matrix, or of parts 
composed of such materials, which process essentially 

comprises the step consisting of applying, by the tape 
casting technique, a suspension or slip of the powder 

intended to constitute the matrix, onto fibres (8), 
arranged on a plate (6), characterized in that the said 

fibres are stretched between two combs (7) arranged 
respectively at each end of the said plate, in that the 

said suspension or slip has a chemical affinity with the 
surface of the said fibres, and in that the said fibres, 

uncoated, have optionally been pre-treated to enhance the 
chemical affinity of the slip. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the powder intended to constitute the matrix is the 

outcome of the sol-gel, sol-salt or glass route. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the suspension or slip contains, apart from the 

powder, one or more solvents, one or more dispersants, one 
or more binders, one or more plasticisers and, optionally, 

one or more additives selected in particular from homogenizers 
and release agents. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the suspension or slip additionally 

contains at least one agent capable of producing a chemical 
affinity with the fibres or reinforcing it, preferably at 

least one wetting agent compatible with the organic constituents 
present. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the fibres are selected from the 

group consisting of SiC, Al

 fibres. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the fibres used have undergone pre-treatment 

enhancing their wettability by the casting 
suspension or slip in an organic medium, by means of the 

adsorption of a wetting agent. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the suspension or slip is deposited 

on a film of synthetic material resting on the plate (6) 
and over which the fibres (8) are stretched. 
Suspension or slip for the execution of the 
process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, containing 

the powder intended to constitute the matrix, one or more 
solvents, one or more dispersants, one or more binders, one 

or more plasticisers, optionally one or more additives selected 
in particular from homogenizers and release agents, 

characterized in that it additionally contains at least one 
agent capable of producing a chemical affinity with the 

fibres that are to be used or reinforcing it, preferably at 
least one wetting agent compatible with the organic 

constituents present. 
Tape-casting bench for the execution of the 
process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, including a 

distribution shoe (11) for a casting suspension or slip on 
a table (1), which shoe is movable over the entire length 

of the table, over a flat, fixed support (2, 6) and has 
means for regulating the thickness of the cast tape (16, 

17), characterized in that the said support is equipped 
with end combs (7) capable of stretching and holding an 

array of parallel fibre rovings (8) on the said support and 
in that the said shoe is profiled internally (14, 15) and 

externally (13, 16) so as to be suitable for casting on 
fibres. 
Casting bench according to Claim 9, characterized 
in that the shoe (11) is in the form of a reservoir, open 

at the bottom, and the front wall (13, 14) of which, in the  
 

direction of movement, has an inclined and/or profiled 
outer face (13) and an inner face (14) which is also 

inclined and/or profiled in order to form a funnel and so 
as to facilitate the flow of the suspension or slip, and 

the rear wall (15, 16) of which is formed by a fixed 
vertical plate (15) against which slides a movable plate 

(16) acting as a knife, which can be manoeuvred by means of 
one or more micrometric screws (17). 
Casting bench according to Claim 9 or 10, characterized 
in that each comb (7) is formed by a fixed L-shaped 

portion (9) provided with regularly spaced openings for the 
passage of the fibre rovings (8) and by a small fixing 

plate (10) intended to be attached to the fixed portion (9)
