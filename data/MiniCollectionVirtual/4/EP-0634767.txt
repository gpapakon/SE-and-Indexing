<ABSTRACT>
A relay having a coil, a magnet system and a contact system which is produced from an electrically insulating material, can be operated by a comb and has two pole paths, these elements all being arranged in a housing which consists of a base body and a cover. In order to achieve separation of the pole paths, it is provided that the comb (6) has a flap (7) which is in the form of a plate, runs between two pole paths of the contact system and is guided in grooves (9, 16) which are arranged in the base body (1) and/or in the cover (17).

Relay having a coil (4), a magnetic system and 
a contactor system which can be operated by said magnet 

system via a comb (6) produced from an electrically 
insulating material, has two pole paths and is arranged 

in a housing which comprises a base body (1) and a cover 
(17), the two pole paths being separated by a wall (7) 

running between them, characterized in that the wall is 
formed at least partially by a flap (7) which is in the 

form of a plate, is held by the comb (6) or is integrally 
formed on it, and is guided in a groove (9, 16) which is 

arranged in the base body (1) and/or in the cover (17). 
Relay according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the base body (1) has a web (10) which projects 

between the pole paths of the contact system and has a 
head strip (11) in which the groove (9) which holds the 

comb flaps (7) is incorporated. 
Relay according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the cover (17) has a strip (18) which runs 

parallel to the web (10) of the base body (1) and 
projects inwards, in which the groove (16) for holding 

the comb (6) is incorporated.
