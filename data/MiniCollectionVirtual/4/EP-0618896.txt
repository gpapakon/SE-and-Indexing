<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for converting a first isomer into 
a second isomer wherein the first and second isomers are epimers of the 
same compound. It is known from EP-A-0 002 289 to convert the single isomer 
(+)-R-α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (+)-S-α-isopropyl-4-chlorophenylacetate into 
the epimeric (-)-S-α-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl ester by treating a solution of 
the isomer with a base. The present invention provides a process for obtaining an isomer of a 
compound of general formula 
R-CH(CN)-R' 
wherein R is an ester group linked through the ether oxygen to the carbon 
atom bearing the cyano group and R' is an optionally substituted aryl or 
heteroaryl group provided that at least one of R and R' comprises at least 
one resolved chiral centre which is stable under the conditions of the 
process, or a racemic modification comprising the isomer and its 
enantiomer, which comprises the step of treating the epimer of the isomer, 
or the racemate comprising the epimer and the enantiomer of the epimer, in 
solution or in slurry in a monohydric lower alkanol containing up to six 
carbon atoms containing, within the limits of miscibility, water in an 
amount of less than 20% by volume, in which the epimer or the racemate is 
partially soluble, with a source of cyanide ions, in the absence of a base, 
the isomer, or the racemic modification comprising the isomer and its 
enantiomer, being less soluble in the solvent or diluent than the epimer of 
the isomer, or the racemate comprising the epimer of the isomer and the 
enantiomer of the epimer, respectively. In a preferred aspect the process of the invention provides a means to 
obtain the isomer from its epimer where the epimer has been obtained by a 
production process in admixture with the isomer, and similarly it provides 
a means to obtain the racemic modification comprising the isomer and its 
enantiomer from the racemate comprising the epimer and the enantiomer of 
the epimer where the racemate has been obtained by a production process in 
admixture with the isomer and its enantiomer. Although the process is generally applicable to the production of any 
isomer or racemic modification of a compound of formula I having the 
defined solubility characteristics, it is particularly useful for obtaining 
isomers and racemates of compounds  
 
such as for example, those wherein R is selected from 
3-(2,2-dihalovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropylcarbonyloxy, 3-(2-optionally 
substituted phenyl-2-halovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropylcarbonyloxy, 
3-(2-haloalkyl-2-
