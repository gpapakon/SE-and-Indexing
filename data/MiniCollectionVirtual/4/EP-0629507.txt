<ABSTRACT>
A recording head is described having mounted thereon M 
modules, each module comprising an array of N LEDs (11) 

and associated drivers (12, 13). The recording head 
comprises a carrier bar (20), and a carrier strip (40) 

fixedly and electroconductively and thermoconductively 
secured to a surface of the carrier bar. The carrier 

strip comprises along one side thereof M spaced 
individual module carriers (14) connected with the rest 

of said carrier strip by means of at least one frangible 
zone (19). M LED dies and associated driver module dies 

are fixedly secured to the surface of said M module 
carriers, each die containing an array of N linearly 

arranged LEDs. The array of N LEDs of each die overlaps 
the space between the spaced individual module carriers 

in order to come in abutting relationship with the end or 
ends of neighbouring N LED arrays. In said LED array a 

module carrier (14) on which a defective module is 
present can be replaced without damaging the adjacent 

modules.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with a LED recording head 
comprising light emitting diodes (LEDs) particularly 
suited for use in electrophotographic printers. 
The growing trend in office printing, graphic arts 
applications and short run printing has resulted in a 
great deal of research efforts being carried out in the 
field of electrophotographic printers. Notwithstanding 
the relatively complicated printing process, requiring a 
relatively large number of steps, the electrophotographic 
process excels as a consequence of its high speed, high 
resolution and the possibility to implement colour, 
making it a prime process for printing high quality 
colour work. At present, more and more use is made of LED arrays at 
the exposure station of electrophotographic printers 
taking advantage of the fact that LED exposure stations 
have no moving parts and that no complicated optics are 
required, such as is the case of laser printers. The use 
of LED arrays has a particular advantage over the use of 
lasers in that positional accuracy, especially important 
in multi-station printers where two or more images have 
to be superimposed in exact registration, is easier to 
achieve. Moreover, LED arrays are available at a 
sufficiently high packing density, say 600 and even more 
LEDs per inch, so that the necessary conditions for high 
resolution printing are fulfilled.  
 
For example, printing along the width of a paper of 21,6 cm x 27,9 cm (8.5 x 
11 inches), will require a recording head having at least 
8.5 x 600 = 5100 LEDs at 600 dpi resolution and which 
have to be selectively energised as a function of the 
data to be recorded. It would not be possible to mount 
so many LEDs on a single LED die. Therefore, a chosen 
number of LEDs, typically 128 LEDs, are mounted on a 
single LED die. An array of more, in general N, LEDs with their 
associated drivers is referred to hereinafter as a 
module. An appropriate number M of these modules is used 
to make up a LED array. The process of recording evolves in a line by line 
fashion so that at the end of recording a page, an 
electrostatic latent image is formed on a pre-charged 
photoconductive drum or belt, which becomes image-wise 
discharged by the light emitted by the LEDs. This latent 
image is subsequently rendered visible by means of toner 
in a dry or liquid developing process. Subsequently the 
toner image is transferred to a final carrier, e.g. a 
sheet of paper, paper web, film or an aluminium printing 
plate and fixed at the surface thereof.
