<ABSTRACT>
A twin mass flywheel (10) for a vehicle in which two co-axially arranged flywheel masses (11, 12) are mounted for limited angular rotation relative to each other. The flywheel masses are interconnected by linkages (40) with each linkage comprising a first link (41) pivotally connected (43) to one of the flywheel masses (11), a second link (42) pivotally connected (44) to the other of the flywheel masses (12), and a pivot (45) for pivotally connecting the first and second links. The linkages are arranged to tend to move radially outwardly as the flywheel rotates to control the relative rotation of the flywheel masses. Cushioning means (54, 55) are provided at the radially outer margins of the flywheel masses which act as resilient travel end stops at the limits of relative rotation of the flywheel masses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to twin mass flywheel sub assemblies and twin mass flywheels 
for absorbing or compensating for torsional 
vibrations such as can arise in a vehicle transmission 
assembly. More particularly, the invention relates to a twin mass 
flywheel of the type described in WO 89/01097 in which two 
coaxial flywheel masses which are mounted for limited 
angular rotation relative to each other; and a plurality of 
pivotal linkages directly interconnect the two flywheel masses each 
comprising a first link pivotally connected to one of the 
flywheel masses, and a second link pivotally connected to 
the other of the flywheel masses, and pivot means for 
pivotally connecting the first and second links, said 
linkages having a greater mass adjacent the pivot means to 
tend to move radially outwardly as the twin mass flywheel 
rotates, thereby controlling relative rotation of the 
flywheel masses. A problem arises due to the pivotal linkage striking one of 
the flywheel masses at extremes of relative rotation, 
thereby causing noise. A proposal for the use of cushioning 
means at the limits of relative rotational movement is 
disclosed in WO 92/14076. The cushioning means disclosed  
 
therein have problems due to the conflicting requirements of 
resilience on one hand and wear resistance on the other 
hand. It is an object of the present invention to provide a twin 
mass flywheel of the above type that is easy to assemble and 
may also have improved cushioning means. According to the invention there is provided a twin mass 
flywheel sub-assembly which comprises a pair of axially 
spaced side plates which in operation are connected with a 
first flywheel mass, a force transmitting member having 
portions disposed between the side plates and which in 
operation is connected with a second flywheel mass, and a 
plurality of linkages interconnecting the side plates and 
the force transmitting member, each linkage comprising a 
first link pivotally connected to the force transmitting member, a 
second link pivotally connected to the side plates, 
and a pivot for pivotally connecting the first and 
second links, said linkages being arranged to tend to move 
radially outwardly as the sub-assembly rotates thereby 
controlling relative rotation of the side plates and force 
transmitting member. The force transmitting member may comprise a pair of flange 
plates in back to back configuration.  
 The sub-assembly may include cushioning means which act 
between the force transmitting member and the
