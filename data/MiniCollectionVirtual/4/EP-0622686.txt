<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an 
electrophotographic toner applicable in the fields of, for 
example, electrophotography and electrostatic record. A preparation of toner for developing electrostatic 
images has been conventionally carried out in such a manner 
that: a coloring agent like dyestuff and pigment and optionally 
by a magnetic material, a charge controlling agent and an offset 
prohibitor are added to a molten thermoplastic resin, and mixed 
well and the mixture is cooled to solidify, followed by 
pulverization and classification. The conventional method, however, has been 
confronting with troubles such as a multiplicity of steps and 
apparatuses, complex process and difficulty in producing toner 
of small grain sizes. Further it has a drawback that the 
produced powder has not only a wide grain distribution but also 
non-uniform shapes so that the material has a poor fluidity, 
resulting in fog of an image. To prepare toner with a uniform grain shape, a small 
grain size and a narrower grain distribution, various 
polymerization processes have been proposed. For example, 
Japanese Patent Publication Nos. Sho 47-518305 and Sho 51 - 
14895 disclose a method by a suspension polymerization, 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 63-282749 by an emulsion 
polymerization and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 3-200976  
 
by a dispersion polymerization. However, the toners produced by such polymerization 
methods irresistibly contain a dispersing agent which is used in 
the polymerization process. Thus the toners prepared by 
polymerization methods are in general sensitive to humidity, 
which is likely to deteriorate charge properties and fluidity. 
Moreover, there still exist problems that; kinds and amounts of 
applicable charge controlling agent are so restricted as not to 
prevent polymerization reaction; electrified quantities may 
fluctuate among the toner particles due to inhomogeneous 
dispersion state of the charge controlling agent; and the charge 
controlling agent is present within the toner particles, which do 
not contribute to friction electrification, leading to an 
insufficient utilization of the charge controlling agent. Various attempts have been done to improve the 
charge properties of toner produced by polymerization methods. 
For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. Sho 62-226162 and 
Sho 64-59239 disclose a toner preparation method, wherein 
organic resin fine particles are adhered to surfaces of colored 
polymer particles. But in adhesion of organic resin fine 
particles
