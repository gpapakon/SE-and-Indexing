<CLAIMS>
Method for making uniform, large-size, in
particular machined single crystals of calcium

fluoride, by tempering at elevated temperature, the
crystal being held in a tempering vessel provided with

a cover during the tempering, 
characterized in that
 a
calcium fluoride powder is introduced into the

tempering vessel, and 
in that
 the crystal is heated for
at least two hours at temperatures above 1150°C.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the tempering vessel at least partially comprises
carbon.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 PbF
2
 powder, graphite powder or
mixtures thereof is introduced into the tempering

vessel.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the tempering is carried out
under a reducing atmosphere in the tempering vessel.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 tempering is carried out under a
protective gas.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 the protective gas used is N
2
, Ar,
He or Xe.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 tempering is carried out under a
fluorine-containing atmosphere.
Method according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that

the fluorine-containing atmosphere used is F
2
, HF, CF
4
,
fluorocarbons and/or fluorohydrocarbons.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the CaF
2
, PbF
2
 and/or graphite
powder has a grain size of 100 nm-200 µm.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,


characterized in that
 the single crystal which is to be
tempered is in direct contact with the powder during

the tempering.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the heating is stopped at a
temperature between 1150 and 1170°C, this temperature

is maintained for at least five hours and then further
heating to the actual tempering level is carried out

slowly.
Use of single crystals obtained using the method
of Claims 1-11 for making lenses, prisms, light-conducting

rods, optical windows and optical components
for DUV photolithography, steppers, excimer lasers,

wafers, computer chips and integrated circuits and
electronic devices containing such circuits and chips.
