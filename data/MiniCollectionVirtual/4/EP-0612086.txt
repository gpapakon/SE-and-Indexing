<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a drive for an electrical power circuit breaker having a cam disc and a transmission element (11), which can be driven between a first position and a second position of the cam disc (10), as well as having a braking element (3) which decelerates the transmission element (11), the cam disc (10) is formed in such a manner that the differential quotient (f') of the distance travelled by the transmission element (11) and the rotation angle of the cam disc (10), considered as a function of the rotation angle of the cam disc (10), is at a maximum (18) in the initial range of movement transmission between the cam disc (10) and the transmission element (11). In consequence, the transmission element (11) is accelerated rapidly, followed by slow braking.

Drive for an electrical circuit-breaker, 
having a drivable cam disc (10) which is supported for 

rotation around a fixed axis and which, during a 
movement in the interval (20) between a first position 

and a second position, drives a transmission element 
(11) capable of moving perpendicularly relative to the 

axis (9), which transmission element drives parts of 
the circuit-breaker and is connected to a brake element 

that slows down its movement, characterised in that the 
cam disc (10) is shaped in such a way that the 

differential quotient (f') formed from the distance 
covered by the transmission element (11) and the angle 

of rotation covered by the cam disc (10), considered as 
a function of the angle of rotation of the cam disc 

(10), has an absolute maximum (18) in the region 
between the first position and the middle of the 

interval (20), and represents a monotonously decreasing 
function in the region between the place of the 

absolute maximum (18) and the second position. 
Drive according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the monotonously decreasing function is convex and 

in that the brake element (3) is formed so that the 
brake force on the transmission element (11) constantly 

increases between the configuration which corresponds 
to the position of the cam disc (10) at the absolute 

maximum (18) and the configuration which corresponds to 
the second position of the cam disc (10). 
Drive according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the differential quotient is equal to zero in the 

first position of the cam disc (10). 
Drive according to claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterised in that the 

differential quotient is equal to zero in the second 
position of the cam disc (10). 
Drive according to claim 1 or one of the  
 

subsequent claims, characterised in that the brake 
element (3) is formed as a spring. 
Drive according to claim 1 or one of the 
subsequent claims, characterised in that the brake 

element (3) is formed as an energy storing device for 
the circuit-breaker.
