<DESCRIPTION>
Stable single-phase aqueous solutions of a plurality
of iso-alpha acids; in this case a single phase aqueous
solution containing tetrahydro iso-alpha acids or hexahydro
iso-alpha acids at a concentration which cannot be attained
with that particular iso-alpha acid alone, together with
another type of iso-alpha acid which serves to solubilize
the tetrahydro iso-alpha acid or hexahydro iso-alpha acid
and stabilize the solution.The bitterness of beer is due to the presence of
iso-alpha acids. In traditional brewing, they are formed
during the boiling of the hops in the kettle. This
produces unreduced iso-alpha acids (UIA) which are unstable
in light, producing off-flavors. To overcome this deficiency,
hydrogenation of the unreduced iso-alpha acids
(UIA) to form dihydro (DHIA), tetrahydro (THIA), and
hexahydro (HHIA) iso-alpha acids has been commercialized,
and these three different kinds of reduced molecules are
now routinely used in the brewing art.While all of the reduced kinds (forms) provide
stability to light, the art has now recognized that the
tetrahydro and hexahydro kinds increase the foam, cling,
and mouthfeel as compared with unreduced or dihydro 
iso-alpha acids. In some instances, they are used for
these effects alone, i.e., even though light stability is
not required.While all of these hop bitter acids can be added to
the kettle in the form of a paste or solid, the preferred
point of addition is after fermentation. This improves the
control of the flavor and improves the efficiency with
which the hop herb is converted into bitter acids.
Formulations for post-fermentation addition of iso-alpha
acids are described in three patents, all of which permit
dilution in water to form 1% to 2% solutions of the bitter
acids prior to addition to the beer. The formulations
employed also depend upon the pH adjustment of the liquid
iso-alpha acid composition to achieve a stable, single-phase,
concentrated, liquid solution.In the art, the term isohumulone has been used
generically to describe the collection of analogues, which
differ in a side chain. At the present time, the term
iso-alpha acid is preferably used to describe this mixture.
For the purposes of this specification, the term iso-alpha
acid will be used and include all the analogues present in
the parent hop. Furthermore, di-,tetra-, and hexa-hydro
denote the addition of two, four, or six hydrogens to the
unreduced molecule without changing the side chain.
Accordingly, four distinct molecular kinds of iso-alpha
acids are used commercially. Each
