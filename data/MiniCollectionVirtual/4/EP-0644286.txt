<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement comprises a weft frequence control with weft-thread feeders (1), a controlled thread clamp (2) with clamping points (3a-3f) and a guide member (4) having a slot (5). Because the assignment of the weft-thread feeders (1) to clamping points (3a-3f) guarantees intersection-free running paths of the weft threads and the displacement of the clamping points into the reference plane (6) leaves these running paths uninfluenced, the weft thread is fed to the gripper in the reference plane (6) by a coordination of the movements of the clamping point and of the assigned weft-thread feeder (1), contact between the weft threads being prevented.

Arrangement for the presenting of weft threads (8a-8f) 
in a reference plane (6) of a rapier weaving machine, 

the arrangement comprising a plurality of controllable 
weft thread presenting devices (1), a controllable 

thread clamp (2) having a plurality of clamping 
positions (3a-3f) which is disposed removed from the 

weft thread presenting devices and also a guide member 
(4) having a slit (5), in order to align the weft 

threads (8a-8f) in the reference plane (6), wherein the 
alignment of each weft thread (8a-8f) can be 

predetermined by the position of the clamping position 
(3a-3f), by the position of the corresponding weft 

thread presenting device (1) and also by the position of 
the guide member (4), 
characterised in that
 the thread 
clamp (2) has at least three clamping positions (3a-3f) 

which are arranged above one another at constant 
spacings, and are each movable substantially 

perpendicular to the reference plane (6) in order to 

hold the weft threads (8a-8f) extending between the weft 
thread presenting devices (1) and the clamping positions 

(3a-3f) both substantially parallel and free of 
cross-overs, and also, in each case, to align one of the 

weft threads (8a-8f) into the reference plane (6), in 
each case without contacting further weft threads 

(8a-8f). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised by a 
positioning device (9) in order to move one clamping 

position (3a-3f) in each case into the reference plane 
(6) and to make ready the weft thread (3a-3f) held in 

the clamping position for the take-over by the gripper 
(35).  

 
Arrangement according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the positioning device (9) is a stepping motor. 
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised by an 
opening member (17) arranged movably in the reference 

plane (6) in order to hold open the clamping position 
(3a-3f) displaced into the reference plane and to make 

it available for the taking-up of the picked weft 
thread. 
Arrangement according to claim 4, characterised by a 
driving device (10) for the opening member. 
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised by a holder (11) of fixed position, by 

clamping bodies (12) which are arranged in the holder 
and by a positioning member (13) which is operationally 

connected to the clamping bodies and to the positioning 
device in order to move the selected clamping position 

(3a-3f) into the reference plane (6). 
Arrangement according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the opening member (17) is displaceably arranged in the 

holder (11) and can be brought into engagement with the 
two clamping bodies (12) forming the selected clamping 

position (3a-3f) in order to hold open the selected 
clamping position. 
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the spacing of the clamping positions (3a-3f) amounts to 

at least 1 mm. 
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the guide member (4) is of fixed  

 
position with respect to the reference plane (6) in 

order to transfer the weft threads (8a-8f) to be 
inserted in the reference plane (6) and to take-over the 

inserted weft threads. 
Arrangement according to one of claims 2 to 9, 
characterised in that the guide member (4) includes a 

recess (7), in that the clamping positions (3a-3f) are 
displaceable within an area determined by the contour of 

the recess (7) in order to lead the weft threads 
(8a-8f), free of contact, from the weft thread 

presenting devices (1) to the clamping positions 
(3a-3f), and in that the slit (5) opens into the recess 

(7) in order to present the weft threads (8a-8f) to be 
inserted to the gripper (35). 
Rapier loom having a frame and an arrangement according 
to one of the claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the 

thread clamp (2) is arranged in the frame at a 
predetermined spacing with respect to the cloth edge 

(31) and in that a cutting device is provided in order 
to cut the inserted weft thread after the clamping.
