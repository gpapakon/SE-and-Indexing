<ABSTRACT>
The sunshade arrangement comprises a roll-up drum (5) 
for a sunshade awning (6) which is attached to a front 

crosspiece (7) mounted on extensible arms (8). Said 
extensible arms comprise two length portions of hollow 

profiled metal section (9, 10) that are connected to each 
other by means of an articulated elbow joint (11) and 

elastic biasing means (13, 14) that are adapted to 
normally keep said extensible arms in the extended 

position of said sunshade awning. Said elastic biasing 
means (13, 14) are housed inside said hollow profiled 

metal sections (9, 10), each one of which comprises two 
complementary longitudinal portions (24, 25) that have an 

open cross-section contour and are joined to each other 
along their sides by means of snap-fitting coupling means 

(27, 28), so that free lateral access is gained to the 
inside of said profiled metal sections when said 

complementary portions (24, 25) are separated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sunshade arrangement with 
extensible arms, that is an awning of the type comprising 
a support frame with at least a pair of articulated arms 
that are adapted to be stretched out by means of elastic 
biasing means so as to normally keep a sunshade awning in 
its open or extended position. It is commonly known that such sunshade arrangements 
with extensible arms are further provided with a roll-up 
drum which is adapted to be actuated, against the force 
of said elastic biasing means, so as to roll up the 
awning into the closed or retracted position of the 
sunshade arrangement and, at the same time, to fold back 
the extensible arms. In particular, each one of said extensible arms 
usually comprises a first and a second length portion 
(that are called "arm" and "forearm" , respectively) that 
are made of profiled metal sections and are 
interconnected in correspondence of a respective end by 
means of an elbow-type articulated joint. The other end  
 
of said first length portion is hinged, by means of a 
"shoulder"-like articulated joint, on an attachment 
bracket situated close to the roll-up drum, whereas a 
front crosspiece, to which the sunshade awning is 
attached, is hinged on the free end of said second length 
portion. The afore cited elastic biasing means comprise at 
least a tension spring whose ends are hooked, through 
metal cables or connection chains, to said articulated 
shoulder joint on one side and, on the other side, that 
portion of said articulated elbow joint which is attached 
to the forearm. This system of spring-loaded connection, 
which demands a relatively large space lengthwise, allows 
for the spring to be appropriately sized so as to provide 
the extensible arm with the high tractional force that is 
required to ensure a correct opening of the awning in its 
stretched-out position, while at the same time minimizing 
any possible relaxation of the spring following repeated 
actuation of the same awning into its retracted position. Usually, the two lengths of the extensible arm are 
formed by respective profiled hollow metal sections, 
which have a variably shaped (for instance rectangular, 
circular, elliptical, etc.) closed cross-section and 
inside which said biasing spring is mounted along with 
its associated connection means in a concealed way so as 
to extend along the whole axial length of said first 
arm section and continue into said forearm section 
downstream of said articulated elbow joint. In particular, the spring shall be

<CLAIMS>
Sunshade arrangement comprising a rear roll-up drum 
for a sunshade awning that is attached to a front 

crosspiece mounted on at least two articulated arms that 
are extensible from a retracted position to an extended 

position of said sunshade awning, each extensible arm 
comprising a first length portion of hollow profiled 

metal section with a closed cross-section contour, of 
which the rear end is hinged by means of an articulated 

shoulder joint on to a support frame adapted to be 
mounted on a wall, as well as a second length portion of 

hollow profiled metal section with a closed cross-section 
contour that is hinged on to said front cross-piece, said 

first and second length portions of profiled metal 
section being connected to each other by means of an 

articulated elbow joint and elastic biasing means capable 
of normally keeping the extensible arm in said extended 

position of the sunshade awning, said elastic biasing 
means extending essentially inside at least one of said 

hollow profiled metal sections, characterized in that at 
least one of the hollow profiled metal sections (9, 10) 

housing said elastic biasing means (13, 14) comprises two 
complementary longitudinal portions (24, 25) having an 

open cross-section and laterally coupled to each other 
by means of detachable attachment means, so as to provide 

 
for free, convenient access sideways to the inside of the 

hollow profiled metal section when said complementary 
portions (24, 25) are separated. 
Sunshade arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said detachable attachment means 

comprise snap-fitting fastening means (27, 28) provided 
in correspondence of respective mating edges of said 

complementary portions (24, 25) coupled to each other. 
Sunshade arrangement according to claim 1, wherein 
said articulated shoulder joint and said articulated 

elbow joint comprise extensions inserted in respective 
ends of said first and said second length portion of 

hollow profiled metal section, characterized in that said 
extensions (15, 16, 17) are attached axially to the 

respective profiled metal sections (9, 10) by means of 
fit-in fastening means (29) adapted to hook on laterally 

by the coupling of shapes to complementary fit-in means 
provided inside at least one of said complementary 

portions (24, 25) of the associated profiled metal 
sections. 
Sunshade arrangement according to claim 1, wherein 
the second length portion of profiled metal section of 

each extensible arm is hinged on to the front crosspiece 
by means of a hinging ferrule means having an extension 

inserted in the fore end of said second length portion of 
profiled metal section, characterized in that said 

extension (23) is attached axially to said second length 
portion of profiled metal section (10) by means of fit-in 

fastening means (29) adapted to hook on laterally by the 
coupling of shapes to complementary fit-in fastening 

means provided inside at least one of said complementary 
portions (24, 25) of the second length portion of 

profiled metal section (10). 
Sunshade arrangement according to the preceding 
claims 3 and 4, characterized in that said complementary 

fit-in fastening means are provided on respective 
reinforcing ribs (26) extending longitudinally inside 

said hollow profiled metal sections (9, 10).
