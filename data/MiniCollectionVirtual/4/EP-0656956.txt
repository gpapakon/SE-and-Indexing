<ABSTRACT>
An aluminum-based alloy composition having improved combinations of strength and fracture toughness consists essentially of 2.5-5.5 percent copper, 0.10-2.30 percent magnesium, with minor amounts of grain refining elements, dispersoid additions and impurities and the balance aluminum. The amounts of copper and magnesium are controlled such that the solid solubility limit for these elements in aluminum is not exceeded. The figure illustrates the broad composition ranges for (A, B, and C) including specific alloy samples 2 through 5 as exemplary inventive alloy. The dotted line shows the preferred alloy composition. The inventive alloy composition may also include 0.10-1.00 percent silver for improved mechanical properties. The alloys are useful as for aircraft and aerospace structure parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved aluminum-copper-magnesium alloy and more particularly relates to an aluminum-copper-magnesium alloy which contains silver and is characterized by excellent combinations of mechanical strength and high toughness.In the aircraft and aerospace industries, aluminum alloys are used extensively because of the durability of the alloys as well as the reduction in weight achieved by their use. Alloys useful in aircraft and aerospace applications must have excellent strength and toughness properties. A number of alloys have been developed for these applications. These types of alloys include wrought alloys that have been subjected to various heat treatment and deformation processes to optimize properties for a particular application. However, a continuing need remains in the industry for a high strength, high toughness aluminum alloy which may be useful in a variety of product applications where it may be difficult or inconvenient to apply cold deformation prior to subsequent heat treating processes such as artificial aging treatments. The present invention meets this need in the aircraft and aerospace industries by providing an aluminum alloy which contains critical amounts of copper, magnesium and silver. The alloy of the present invention, as a result of the combination of alloying components, has potential applications in a wide variety of areas including forgings, plate, sheet, extrusions, weldable components and matrix material for composite structures.Aluminum alloys are known in the art which contain magnesium, copper and silver.Staley et al., in "Metallurgical Transactions", January, 1972, pages 191-199, discusses high strength Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys, with and without silver additions. In this publication, Staley et al. studied the effects of silver additions with respect to the heat treating characteristics of high strength alloys. Staley et al. makes reference to a publication by Polmear in "Journal of the Institute of Metals", 1960, Volume 89, pages 51 and 193, who reported that 0.3 to 1% of silver additions substantially increased the strength of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys.United States Patent Number 3,414,406 to Doyle et al. discloses a copper, manganese and titanium-containing aluminum alloy with the inclusion of 0.1-0.5 weight percent of magnesium. The aluminum alloy also includes from 0.2-0.4 weight percent of silver. Moreover, the aluminum alloy of Doyle et al. requires an amount of silicon between 0.1 to 0.35 percent by weight.United States Patent Number 4,610,733 to
