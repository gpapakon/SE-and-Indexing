<ABSTRACT>
Polyphenylene ether-based lubricant compositions can be improved in 
regard to anti-wear properties by inclusion of a hydrocarbyl 

bis(dihydrocarbylphosphate) compound, for example, at up to about 10% 
by weight. The preferred compounds contain a hydrocarbyl group 

derived from a monoaromatic diol such as resorcinol or hydroquinone 
and are diphenylphosphate species.

<DESCRIPTION>
Polyphenylene ether lubricants represent very stable organic 
structures which meet the needs of jet engines, high temperature 
hydraulic systems, nuclear power plants, and as the fluid component of 
high temperature greases. Although this class of lubricant is 
thermally and oxidatively stable, they can cause significant wear of 
high-alloy steels that are typically used in supersonic and hypersonic 
aircraft jet engines.
 
Polyphenylene ether lubricants have been proposed which contain 
various additives for a variety of purposes. A representative, non-limiting 
listing of additives which have been proposed is as follows: 
chelates of a heavy metal of Groups I-IV and VI-VIII of the Periodic 
Table of the Elements for wear and oxidation resistance and non-sludging 
behavior (U.S. Patent No. 3,360,467); organolead compounds for increased resistance to oxidation, improved 
viscosity stability, and increased color stability (U.S. Patent No. 
3,423,469); perfluorinated aliphatic dibasic acids for enhanced lubrication 
under high load at high temperatures (U.S. Patent No. 3,704,277); phenoxyphenylphosphinic acid for enhanced lubrication under high 
load at high temperature (U.S. Patent No. 3,706,668). The present invention relates to a polyphenylene ether lubricant 
comprising an effective amount of a hydrocarbyl 
bis(dihydrocarbylphosphate) compound as an anti-wear additive. These 
additives have been unexpectedly found not to significantly affect the 
excellent thermal stability of the polyphenylene ether lubricant. 
Hydrocarbyl bis(dihydro-carbylphosphate) compounds have been used as  
 
additives in fuels for internal combustion engines (U.S. Patent No. 
3,254,973), as extreme pressure and anti-wear additives in oleaginous 
or petroleum based lubricants (U.S. Patent No. 3,492,373; also see 
U.S. Patent No. 3,360,467 at Col. 1, line 58 to Col. 2, line 2, for 
the non-predictable behavior of such additives when in a polyphenylene 
either fluid), and as a low flammability hydraulic oil, in general 
(U.S. Patent No. 4,212,832). The polyphenylene ether lubricant of the present invention comprises, 
as the base stock, a polyphenylene ether of the formula

Ar-O-[Ar-O]n-Ar


 
where Ar stands for a phenyl ring, n is a whole number of generally 
from 2 to 5. This class of lubricant is well known to persons of 
ordinary skill in the art with the following patents, which are 
incorporated herein by reference, providing further disclosure: U.S. 
Patent Nos. 3,360,467; 3,423,469; 3,476,815; 3,704,277; and 3,706,668.
