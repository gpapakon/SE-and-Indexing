<ABSTRACT>
Arranged on a longitudinal side of an aluminium extruded profile is an extending web 1 provided at the end with an angled-off portion 3, the web 1, with its angled-off portion 3, being insertable into a receiving groove 2, located on the other longitudinal side of the adjacent, parallel extruded profile, and the extending web 1 being fixable in the receiving groove 2 by screws 5 which can be inserted from the outside. For this purpose, the free end of the angled-off portion 3 of the extending web 1 is provided with a run-on surface 4 which runs concavely or is formed by a slope. The screws 5 to be inserted make contact with the bearing surface 4, as a result of which the extending web 1 is bent upwards and is pressed, with its profiling 6, into an equivalent mating profiling 7 in the receiving groove 2. The extending web 1 is provided with a predetermined bending line 8 in order to facilitate the bending or angling-off. The embodiment according to the invention ensures sealed abutment of the individual extruded profiles, along with simultaneous securing of the sealed abutment, with the result that, in the event of loading, the profiles cannot move with respect to one another and thus disruptive frictional noise is avoided.

Areal extruded aluminium profile members connectible to form a unit, 
especially to form a tread surface, wherein the extruded aluminium 

profile members are provided at their longitudinal sides with 
corresponding profilings, with a projecting web (1) which is disposed at 

one longitudinal side and the end of which is angled, and a receiving 
groove (2), which is disposed on the other longitudinal side, for the 

insertion of the projecting web (1) by its angled portion (3), wherein 
the projecting web (1) is fixable in the receiving groove (2) of the 

parallelly extending profile member by way of its angled portion (3) by 
fastening elements to be inserted from an outer boundary, wherein the 

angled portion (3) of the projecting web (1) is provided with a run-up 
surface (4) on which the insertable fastening means impinge, 

characterised thereby that the run-up surface (4) is disposed at the free 
end of the projecting web (1) and thereby the extruded aluminium profile 

member having the projecting web can be drawn up to the adjacent profile 
member. 
Extruded aluminium profile member according to claim 1, characterised 
thereby that the run-up surface (4) is formed by a concavely extending 

bow. 
Extruded aluminium profile member according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised thereby that the run-up surface (4) is formed by a slope. 
Extruded aluminium profile member according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised thereby that the angled portion (3) extends at an angle of 

less than 90° to the projecting web (1). 
Extruded alumi-nium profile member according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised thereby that the angled portion (3) extends at both sides 

of the projecting web (1).  
 
Extruded aluminium profile member according to claim 5, characterised 
thereby that the end of the angled portion (3) opposite to the run-up 

surface (4) is provided with a profiling (6) which is associated with an 
equivalent counter-profiling (7) in the receiving groove (2). 
Extruded aluminium profile member according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterised thereby that the end of the angled portion (3) opposite to 

the run-up surface (4) is provided with a reinforcing. 
Extruded aluminium profile member according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised thereby that the projecting web (1) has an intended line 

(8) of bending near its connection location. 
Extruded aluminium profile member according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised thereby that the projecting web (1) is arranged to be 

bendable through approximately 90°. 
Extruded aluminium profile member according to claim 9, 
characterised thereby that the web (1) bent through approximately 90° 

lies within the boundary of the extruded aluminium profile member at the 
longitudinal side. 
Extruded aluminium profile member according to one of claims 1 to 
10, characterised thereby that a row of holes is arranged for the 

insertion of the fastening elements. 
Extruded aluminium profile member according to one of claims 1 to 
11, characterised thereby that the outer boundary of the fastening 

elements lies within the outer boundary of the extruded aluminium profile 
member in the functional state. 
Extruded aluminium profile member according to one of claims 1 to 
12, characterised thereby that screws (5) serve as the fastening 

elements.
