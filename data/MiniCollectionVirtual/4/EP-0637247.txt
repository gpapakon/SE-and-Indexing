<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to anti-viral compounds.
More particularly, the invention relates to the use of
peptide-based anti-viral agents for the treatment of
herpesvirus infections.The herpesviruses constitute a family of human
pathogens related by a number of criteria, including life
cycle, host range, polypeptide composition and genome
structure. The herpesvirus family includes the
herpesviridae that are divided into three sub-families;
α-herpesvirinae which includes herpes simplex virus (HSV)
type 1, which manifests as cold sores and type 2 which
causes genital lesions, pseudorabies virus, equine
abortion virus, and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis
virus; β-herpesvirinae which includes human and murine
cytomegalovirus (CMV); and gamma-herpesvirinae which
includes the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) which is
responsible for infectious mononucleosis. Also included
in the herpesvirus family is the Varicella Zoster virus
(VZV) which is the causative agent of chicken pox, and
the recently discovered human viruses HHV-6 and HHV-7.The current types of herpes treatments are reviewed
in "Antiviral Drugs: Pharmacokinetics, Adverse Effects
and Therapeutic Use", M.C. Nahata, J. Pharm. Technol.,
1987, 3:100. Among current anti-herpetic agents are
acyclovir, and structurally related nucleoside analogues.
The association of anti-herpetic activity with peptides
has been noted, but is less common. In US 4,845,195,
Colonno et al ascribe anti-herpetic activity to the
pentapeptide Val-Val-Asn-Asp-Leu and various analogues
(see also US 4,837,304). Docherty et al. describe, in Antimicrob. Agents Chemotherapy, 1987, Vol. 31(10), p.
5621-1566, the anti-herpetic activity of certain poly-L-histidine, poly-L-lysine and poly-L-arginine
peptides.WO 89/12461 describes a method for preparing antagonists of viral transactivating
proteins, and specifically describes antagonists derived from the HIV tat protein which are useful
in treating individuals infected with HIV. WO 92/07871 teaches oligopeptides also having use
in inhibiting HIV replication in virally infected individuals. Although some significant advances have been made in the
treatment of herpesvirus infections, the need for effective,
safe therapeutic agents for treating herpesvirus infections
continues to exist.It is a general object of the present invention to
provide use of a compound for treating herpesvirus infection in a
mammal.It is a more specific object of the present invention to
provide use of a compound for treating infection by a herpes simplex
virus (HSV).It is
