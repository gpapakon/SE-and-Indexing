<ABSTRACT>
The circuit (CS) comprises a capacitor (C2) intended to 
be connected to the output (Nm) of the level sensor (T) 

via a resistor (R1) in such a way that in use the voltage 
of the said capacitor tends to follow the variations of 

the output voltage of the sensor (T) with a predetermined 
time constant and a voltage controlled current generator 

(OP1) the output and a first input of which are intended 
to be connected to the sensor (T), with the second input 

connected to the said capacitor (C2). This generator 
(OP1) is arranged to provide at its output a 

substantially zero current when the potential difference 
between its inputs is substantially zero and a current 

the magnitude and sign of which depends upon the 
magnitude and sign of the said potential difference when 

it is different from zero, this current tending to oppose 
variations in the voltage which,in operation, are applied 

to the first input of the generator (OP1)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
device for indicating the level of a liquid in a
tank, for example the fuel level in a motor vehicle
tank, of the kind defined in the preamble of Claim 1.For indication of the fuel level in a motor vehicle tank
are utilised devices comprising an indicator instrument,
typically a movable coil, and an associated sensor or
transducer, typically of the floating type are utilised.Due to the movements to which it is subjected when the
motor vehicle is in motion the fuel level is subject to
sharp variations, which cause corresponding movements and
oscillations of the needle of the indicator instrument. To overcome this disadvantage damper circuits have been
proposed constituted essentially by a low pass filter
interposed between the sensor or transducer and the
indicator instrument.A device of the initially defined kind is disclosed in DE-A-34
09 258. The prior device described in this document
includes a resistive level sensor having the output
connected to the input of a damper circuit formed by a
passive RC-type low-pass filter. The output of said low-pass
filter is coupled to the input of a current-driven
indicator instrument through a voltage/current converter
interface. The damping effect is achieved by the passage of
the sensor signal through the low-pass filter.Active low-pass filters including an operational amplifier
and associated RC-components are disclosed in P. Horowitz
and H. Hill: "The art of electronics", 1989, p. 263-274.The above type of arrangement has various disadvantages.In the first place, with the damper circuit interposed
there is a reduced possibility of relative compensation
between the sensor and the indicator instrument when the
supply voltage or the temperature varies.Moreover, in conditions of static equilibrium there cannot
be an exact correspondence between the position of the
needle of the indicator instrument and the effective level
of the liquid in the tank. This type of defect can be
corrected only by performing a specific calibration of the
individual damper circuit in relation to the transducer/indicator
instrument assembly to which it is to be fitted.Interposition of the damper circuit between the sensor and 
the indicator instrument can have the effect that the
indicator instrument does not faithfully reproduce the
characteristic of the sensor. When the interposed damper circuit comprises active
electronic components, which can be subjected to drift,
offset or other leakages, measurement errors can occur
which are difficult to
