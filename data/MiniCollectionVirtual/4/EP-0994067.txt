<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for filling plastic bottles whereby a
dispensing/suction nozzle (1) is inserted into the

mouth (2) at the top of a bottle. The nozzle (1)
dispenses a liquid to fill the bottle and at the same

time sucks out the air contained inside the said
bottle. As the bottle is filled, the nozzle (1) has a

frustoconical surface (6), which is made of steel, that
fits tightly against an edge of the mouth (2), forming

an air-tight seal around the said mouth by virtue of
which seal the pressure inside the bottle can be less

than the pressure in the external environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of the present invention is a method for
filling plastic bottles.
More specifically, but not exclusively, the method can
be usefully applied to aseptic bottling processes.Reference is made in particular to a method whereby a
dispensing/suction nozzle is inserted into the mouth at
the top of each bottle in order to dispense a liquid to
fill the bottle and suck out the air contained inside
the bottle; the method also involves forming an air-tight
seal around the mouth so that, as the bottle is
filled, the pressure inside it is less than the
pressure in the external environment.Various methods of this type are already known: for
example, this category includes the forced-suction
constant-pressure filling method and, more generally,
any method in which the pressure inside the bottle
during the filling stage is different to the pressure
of the environment outside the bottle, as described, for example,
in DE 1039866.In these known methods, the seal around the mouth of
the bottle is produced using a sealing ring made of an
elastic material which is fitted in a seat formed in
the filling member.
The front of the sealing ring is designed to come into
sealing contact with the top edge of the bottle mouth.
As is known, the required seal tightness is achieved as
a result of the deformation to which the sealing ring
is subjected as it is pressed against the edge of the
mouth.However, these known methods have certain limitations
and drawbacks. Firstly, the sealing ring is prone to
rapid wear, both because of the type of material from
which it is made - which is necessarily soft and porous
- and because of the high number of operational cycles
to which it is subjected. In a filling machine, this 
involves frequent replacement of the sealing rings with
the result that the said machine has to be stopped.This problem is further compounded in aseptic filling
machines on account of the heat treatments carried out
during the washing and sterilization stages, and as a
result of which the sealing rings experience thermal
expansion which may even cause them to come out of
their seats. Secondly, the use of a sealing ring can
lead to serious problems in terms of the bottled
product becoming contaminated with bacteria.This is because the product with which the bottles are
filled can easily get into the gap between the sealing
ring and its seat and become trapped therein. Given
that this gap could easily be missed by the washing and
sterilizing action, it is possible for the product to
stagnate, resulting in the growth

Method for filling plastic bottles, each having
a mouth (2) at the top, comprising the following

operations:

inserting a dispensing and suction nozzle (1) into the
mouth (2) of each bottle in order to dispense a liquid

to fill the bottle and suck out the air contained
inside the said bottle;
forming an air-tight seal around the mouth (2) so
that, as the bottle is filled, the pressure inside it

is less than the pressure in the external environment;
characterized in that
 the said seal is produced by an
edge of the mouth (2) fitting tightly against

a substantially frustoconical surface ( 6) that is integral
with the nozzle (1), the said edge of the mouth (2)

being more deformable than the frustoconical surface
(6).
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the edge of the mouth (2) and the frustoconical
surface (6) are pressed against each other with a given

pressure sufficient to obtain a substantially slight elastic yielding of the
mouth (2) of the bottle.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 the said frustoconical surface (6) is the
external surface of the nozzle (1).
Plastic bottles, and a device for filling said plastic bottles, said plastic bottles having
an elastically deformable a mouth (2) at the top thereof, wherein said device comprises :


at least one dispensing and suction nozzle (1) able to
dispense a liquid to fill the bottle and suck out the

air contained inside the bottle, having a lower end
that can be inserted into the mouth (2) at the top of a

bottle, the said end having at least one outlet for the
filling liquid and one inlet for sucking the air out; 
means for feeding the bottle to the nozzle (1) and
for inserting the said lower end of the nozzle (1) into

the mouth (2) at the top of the bottle;
characterized in that
 the nozzle (1) has a
frustoconical external surface (6) that tapers

downwards, the larger diameter of the said surface (6)
being greater than the internal diameter of the mouth

(2), the said surface (6) being shaped so that it fits
tightly against an edge of the mouth (2) of the bottle

and also being less deformable than the said edge.
Plastic bottles, and a device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 the said frustoconical external surface (6) of the
nozzle (1) is made of metal.
Plastic bottles, and a device according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized
in that
 it comprises:

a filling carousel that rotates on command about a
vertical axis of rotation and carries a plurality of

the said dispensing and suction nozzles (1) arranged
circumferentially around the said axis of rotation;
a bottle feed line that can feed the bottles one by
one to the said nozzles, synchronously with the

rotation of the filling carousel.
