Vehicle pneumatic tyre with a tread which is 
composed of tread elements such as blocks 

and/or tread strips and which is provided with 
grooves, especially grooves running in the 

direction of the circumference, cross-grooves and 
the like, with, arranged in the tread, tread 

elements which have at least one channel running 
through them, which channel opens outwards on 

different areas of the tread elements, 
characterised in that each channel (10, 10', 10'', 

12, 12', 12'' 12''') at at least one end opens 
outwards in a groove (5, 5'), particularly in the 

region of the base of the groove. 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the channel (10, 10', 10'', 12, 12', 12'', 12''') at 

the other end opens outwards on the tread surface. 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
  
 

the channel (10') at the other end opens outwards 
in the region of the side wall of the tyre. 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the channel (12') at the other end likewise opens 

outwards in an area of the tread element 
bordering on a groove (5). 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of claims 
1 to 4,
 
characterised in that
 
a fine incision (9, 11, 11', 11'', 11''', 11'''') is 

in contact with the channel (10, 10', 10'', 12, 
12', 12'', 12''') at least in sections. 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of claims 
1 to 5,
 
characterised in that
 
the channel (10, 10'') opens into the groove (5') 

in the region of a local depression (5'a) provided 
there. 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of claims  
 

1 to 6,
 
characterised in that
 
the channel (10, 10', 10'', 12, 12', 12'', 12''') 

discharges into grooves or cross-grooves running 
in the direction of the circumference of the 

tread. 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of claims 
1,2 or 5 to 7,
 
characterised in that the channel (10) has a 

section (10a) running at least substantially in a 
radial direction from the tread surface, which 

section changes into a section (10b) running at 
least substantially parallel to the tread surface 

in the area of the tread element lying radially 
inwards. 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of claims 
1,2 or 4 to 8,
 
characterised in that
 
the channel (12'') at one end discharges into a 

groove (13) formed in the tread element (14'''), 
the depth of which groove is smaller than the rest 

of the design depth of the tread.  
 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of claims 
1 to 9,
 
characterised in that
 
the channel (12''') inside the tread element (14'''') 

divides into two branches (12'''a, 12'''b). 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of claims 
1 to 10,
 
characterised in that
 
the channel (10, 10', 10'', 12, 12', 12'', 12''') has 

a circular cross-section with a diameter of 
especially 2 to 8 mm. 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of claims 
1 to 11,
 
characterised in that
 
the channel (10, 10', 10'', 12, 12', 12'', 12''') 

runs straight and/or curved over part of its 
length at least. 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of claims 
1 to 12,
 
characterised in that
  
 

the channel (10, 10', 10'', 12, 12', 12'') has a 
constant cross-section over its whole length. 
Vehicle pneumatic tyre according to one of claims 
1 to 13,
 
characterised in that
 
the channel is enlarged and/or narrowed at least 

in sections, such alterations to the cross-section 
being achieved especially by means of conically 

formed sections.
