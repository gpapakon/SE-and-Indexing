<DESCRIPTION>
In thermo-electric power generation processes the old, 
established steam turbine cycle is increasingly substituted 
with a combined cycle comprising gas as well as steam 
turbine. In this way power generation can be performed with 
higher efficiency and 45-47% can be reached compared with 
39-41% in the steam turbine cycle. Said high efficiency of 
the combined cycle is, however, obtained only when using 
natural gas as fuel, and for solid natural fuels, such as 
coal and bio (biological) fuels the efficiency is restricted 
to 42-44% because of the complications caused by transforming 
the fuel to a form which is acceptable for the gas turbine. A number or processes, such as pressure (super-atmospheric) 
combustion, complete and partial gasification, etc. have been 
developed for making possible the use of solid natural fuels 
in connection with a combined cycle. All said processes are 
characterized by a high level of complexity and are therefore 
subjected to operation disturbances in a more than normal 
degree. This fact and the moderate efficiency of 42-44% have 
caused that said processes have not been commonly accepted. The present invention is directed to an uncomplicated method 
for transforming solid natural fuels, such as coal, preferably  
 
with 5-45% of volatile constituents, lignites, peat and 
bio fuels, to a form which is suited for a combined cycle, 
wherein the end product of said method is pressurized clean 
hot combustable gas with a high heat value, "reformed gas", 
suited for the gas turbine, and finely-divided hot char with 
a high heat value, which is suitable as a fuel for all types 
of steam generators. Char is here intended to be interpreted 
as the coke-like residue comprising low levels of H, O, N and 
S, which remains after pyrolysis of solid carbonaceous fuels. The method according to this invention is characterized by 
transforming the solid natural fuel to a form suited for the 
combined cycle by pyrolysis in combination with reformation 
of the pyro gas in the presence of water vapour, wherein the 
flow of finely-divided fuel at super-atmospheric pressure, 
suitably 5-20 bars, and >700°C in a first reactor in a 
cascade of reactors, suitably ≥3, in the presence of finely-divided 
burnt lime and/or dolomite (when "lime" is used in 
the following in the specification said expression comprises 
also dolomite) for desulphurization, is brought into fluidizing 
contact with char recirculated from the last reactor in 
said cascade with a flow >5 times larger than the flow of
