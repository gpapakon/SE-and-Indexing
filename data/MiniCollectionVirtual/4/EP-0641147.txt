<ABSTRACT>
A unique ballast circuit arrangement for a 
low pressure discharge lamp provides an improved 

electrode preheat circuit which insures the same proper 
preheat start each time the lamp is turned on, 

including hot restart conditions. Electronic circuitry 
converts a low frequency AC input to a high frequency 

AC output, which is provided to the low pressure 
discharge lamp. A preheat circuit having a positive 

temperature coefficient element, a bidirectional 
switch, and a capacitor connected in series with both 

lamp electrodes, provides proper start conditions under 
all start conditions. Cathode quiescent losses during 

normal lamp operation are eliminated, thereby 
simultaneously improving ballast efficiency and system 

efficacy values of the ballast circuit arrangement and 
the low pressure discharge lamp.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generically 
to all fluorescent lamps that are prone to improper 
instant starting under typical operating conditions 
and, more particularly, to compact fluorescent lamps 
(CFL) which are ballasted electronically at high 
frequency to insure a proper starting scenario under 
all start conditions, particularly a hot restart 
condition. In the field of residential and/or consumer 
lighting, there have been significant efforts made in 
the past several years to encourage more widespread 
public use of compact fluorescent lamps in place of 
less efficient incandescent lamps. Because of the 
significant energy savings that a fluorescent lamp 
offers over the use of an incandescent lamp while still 
attaining a comparable level of light output, public 
acceptance of such a lamp could contribute to the 
overall aim of conserving energy and the natural 
resources that are used to generate such energy. To 
this end, compact fluorescent lamps have been 
introduced and are the fastest growing segment in the 
fluorescent lamps marketplace today. Lamps that use mercury along with an inert 
gas, such as Argon, as a means of converting ultraviolet 
energy into visible light are classified as low 
pressure fluorescent discharge lamps. One such family 
of compact lamps that are commercially available are 
called twin tube lamps and typically range in wattage 
from 5W to 50W. Double twin tube lamp types,  
 
generically called quads, are also commercially 
available, operate within the same range of wattage, 
and also have the desirable compactness feature. 
Additionally, this invention also can apply to any 
fluorescent lamp, regardless of size or voltage, that 
is prone to improper instant start conditions, and 
particularly to hot restart conditions. Since many of the electronic ballasts 
developed for these compact lamps develop high starting 
voltages, many of the compact lamps, including quad and 
hex types, can all be prone to an improper instant 
start condition. Two examples of prior art circuits 
which attempt to alleviate the starting problems 
associated with electronically ballasted compact 
fluorescent lamps can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,647,817 and 4,647,820 issued respectively to Fahnrich 
et al and Chermin et al. Although each patent 
discusses the use of a PTC element as a means for 
preheating the electrodes of the lamp, there is no 
discussion of the circuits operation under a hot 
restrike condition. Another example of a ballast 
circuit for a compact fluorescent
