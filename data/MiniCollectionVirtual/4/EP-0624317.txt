<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 
milk and milk powders having a long storage life utilizing 

techniques which are known per se. To that end, a milk liquid 
is prepared, which is evaporated, and a fat fraction is added 

to the milk liquid in one or more effects of the evaporator. 
This process is particularly suitable for the preparation of a 

milk having a long storage life, in which unsaturated fatty 
acid chains are present.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
preparation of milk concentrates and milk powders having a
long storage life utilizing techniques which are known per se.By bringing milk into a concentrated form or into a
powder form and subjecting it to one or more heat treatments
and to an aseptic packaging method, not only its storage life
is prolonged but also the cost of transport is limited. For
use, the concentrated or powdered milk product can be
recombined or reconstituted.In the case where in particular unsaturated fatty acid-containing
compounds are present, however, the process of fat
decay or 'turning rancid' develops relatively easily and
rapidly with milk concentrates and milk powders. This process
of turning rancid gives rise to deteriation of the taste and
problems of uptake and easily leads to problems of
indigestion, in particular in sensitive individuals. More
particularly, this problem occurs with milk products which
have been enriched with unsaturated fatty acid derivatives or
in which the milk fat has been replaced completely with these
derivatives. Examples of such unsaturated fatty acid
derivatives include fats, phospholipids or emulsifiers which
contain a high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids and/or
strongly unsaturated fatty acids. Enrichment of milk and milk
powders with unsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids
or emulsifiers is done for technological or physiological
reasons.An important reason for enriching milk or milk powders
with fats containing a high percentage of unsaturated fatty
acids or strongly unsaturated fatty acids is to prevent or
reduce cardiovascular diseases, atopies, rheumatic disorders
or diabetes. In particular, such products contain a high
percentage of oleic acid, linoleic acid which may or may not 
be conjugated, α-linolenic acid and unsaturated C20 and C22
fatty acids.Thus, to prepare food for premature children the fat
fraction of milk concentrates or milk powders is enriched with
strongly unsaturated fatty acids of the type C20ω-6 and C22ω-6
+ C20ω-3 and C22ω-3. These fatty acids are typically denoted
by the name of LC-PUFAS, which is an abbreviation of "Long
Chain Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acids". Examples of LC-PUFAS
include: C18:3ω6 (γ-linolenic acid; GLA), C20:3ω6 (dihomo-γ-linolenic
acid), C20:4ω6 (arachidonic acid; AA), C18:4ω3
(octadecatetraenoic acid), C20:5ω3 (eicosapentaenoic acid;
EPA), C22:6ω3 (docosahexaenoic acid; DHA or DCHA).LC-PUFAS are preferably included in the fat fraction of
food for premature children together with
