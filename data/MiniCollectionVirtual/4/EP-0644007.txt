<ABSTRACT>
The axial position of a lateral face of the wheel, the diameter of the wheel and the worn profile of the wheel are determined in a reference system in which the controlled displacement of the reshaping tool (5) takes place, in order to deduce therefrom the diameter and profile of the wheel after reshaping, by placing a sensor which senses contact between the material and the tool in the immediate proximity of the tool (5) and, on the basis of a position of the said tool close to the wheel, the said tool is slowly brought closer to the wheel in order to carry out machining until the moment when the said sensor detects machining contact over a complete revolution of the wheel, the displacement of the said tool being designed so that the first contact of the said tool with the wheel (2) takes place substantially over that part of the wheel surface which is closest to the tool.
