<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an industrial furnace 
provided with rotary regenerative burners for utilizing the 
heat of the exhaust gas resulting from combustion for 
heating an oxidizing agent. Such industrial furnaces as pipestill heater and 
iron and steel furnaces frequently adopt heat recovery type 
combustion devices adapted to utilize the heat of the 
exhaust gas resulting from combustion for heating an 
oxidizing agent. Among these combustion devices is included that 
which is disclosed in Japanese published applications JP-A-1-222,102 
and JP-A-4-101,191, for example. This combustion 
device has attached to the wall of the combustion chamber of 
an industrial furnace a regenerator formed of a regenerative 
material and adapted to manifest perviousness to a gas and 
has a duct part communicating with this regenerator. This 
duct part has formed therein an oxidizing agent duct for 
passing an oxidizing agent and an exhaust gas duct for 
passing the exhaust gas resulting from combustion. Then, 
the oxidizing agent duct is provided therein with an 
oxidizing agent path for passing the oxidizing agent and the 
exhaust gas duct is provided therein with an exhaust gas 
path for passing the exhaust gas resulting from the 
combustion in the industrial furnace. The heating of the 
oxidizing agent is attained through the regenerator heated 
with the exhaust gas by rotating the regenerator and the 
duct part relative to each other. The term "oxidizing agent" as used herein refers 
generally to oxygen atom-containing gases such as pure 
oxygen and nitrogen oxide and oxygen gas-containing mixed 
gases such as air and oxygen-enriched air. This combustion device itself is designated as a  
 
rotary regenerative burner. Since it is adapted to heat the 
oxidizing agent while keeping the regenerator in rotation, 
it is simple in construction as compared with a combustion 
device which requires a heat exchanger for a heat recovery 
to be separately provided exclusively for the purpose of 
heating the oxidizing agent. It is quite effective in 
saving energy because it enables the oxidizing agent to be 
directly heated with the regenerator made of heat-resisting 
material such as ceramics which is heated with the hot 
exhaust gas. Incidentally, this rotary regenerative burner 
accomplishes exchange of heat between the exhaust gas and 
the oxidizing agent by relatively rotating the regenerator 
or the duct part by means of the power such as of an 
electric motor or a pneumatic motor. It can no longer 
attain the
