<ABSTRACT>
Surgical kits for the implantation of soft 
tissue-to-bone anchors and expandable, preferably 

bioabsorbable, soft tissue anchors. The surgical kits 
include an embodiment with an outer tube with an 

expandable anchor releasably attached to its distal end, 
for guiding the anchor into a predrilled hole; an inner 

tube with an anchor expanding pin sized for expanding the 
anchor releasably held in its bore; and a pushrod for 

pushing the anchor pin into the anchor to expand it and 
wedge it in a hole. In an alternative embodiment, the 

anchor pin is attached to the distal end of a pushrod 
inserted into an outer tube. In one embodiment, the 

anchor is equipped with downward extending spikes on the 
underside of an enlarged head for gripping soft tissue 

and bending barbs to resist withdrawal of the anchor from 
bone. In another embodiment, the anchor's proximal end 

has no enlarged head but is equipped with sutures. In a 
further embodiment, the anchor's enlarged head is tilted 

at an angle to allow better engagement of spikes with 
soft tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surgical
implant and to a surgical kit. In the field of surgery
it is sometimes necessary to perform operations to
reattach soft tissue to bone. For example, US Patent
No. 4,924,865 describes a repair tack designed for use
in arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn meniscus in
the knee. Reattachment of soft tissue to bone may also
arise, for instance, when surgery is performed on a
shoulder to remove or repair glenohumeral tissue.Regardless of the circumstance, whenever bone
must be reattached to tissue, it is desirable to have a
fastener or "anchor" that will hold the tissue onto the
bone at its point of reattachment, and that will allow
the tissue to heal and naturally reattach itself to the
bone. Thus, it is desirable that the soft tissue
fixation element should not interfere with the healing
process and should allow progressively heavier loads to
be placed on both bone and soft tissue to encourage
healing and development of attachment strength.US Patent 4,590,928 which is used as basis for the
preamble of claims 1 and 10 and US patent 4,851,005 disclose
surgical implants that include an expandable stud and a
pin for insertion into the stud to expand the stud. The
stud and pin are both fabricated from biodegradable
polymeric materials, and include carbon fibers aligned
along their longitudinal axes. The stud body has an
enlarged head at one end and, at the opposite end, its
cylindrical surface it longitudinally split. Further,
the stud has a cylindrical bore running throughout its
length along its longitudinal axis. The pin is
inserted into this bore thereby forcing the split
distal ends radially outwards, to expand the stud body
and lodge it firmly in a hole in bone. The stud and pin 
combination is used to connect a synthetic flexible
cord for holding two bones together in a mammalian
body.Likewise, US Patent 4,834,752 is directed to a
"tissue augmentation device" for repairing ligaments or
tendons. The device includes at least one strap-like
element (substitute tendon) formed of stable
biocompatible material and a biodegradable element for
connecting the strap-like element to bone. The
biodegradable fasteners shown in Figures 2 and 4 of the
'752 patent, include a pin having a longitudinal body
with a head at one end, a longitudinal bore through the
body, and slits at the distal end of the body producing
longitudinal distal segments. A pin is insertable into
the bore of the body for expanding the segments
radially outward so that they will grip the sides of a
hole
