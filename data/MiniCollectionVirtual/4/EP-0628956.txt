<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical information medium printable 
on a surface thereof opposite to the incidence of laser beam by use of a 
printing ink, and a method for fabricating the same. In the fields such as of audio and information processings, an 
optical information medium called as a compact disk (hereinafter 
referred to simply as CD) has now been in wide use. The CD has a 
structure comprising a substrate in the form of a ring-shaped disk 
made, for example, of polycarbonates, and a reflective layer of gold or 
aluminium vacuum deposited on the substrate. A protective layer such 
as of a UV-cured resin is formed on the reflective layer. Information data 
are encoded by forming projected and recessed pits on or in the surface of 
the substrate according to a spiral arrangement. Simultaneously with 
the formation of the substrate, these pits have been formed using molds 
such as stampers. The reflective layer is then formed on the pit-bearing 
substrate. When fabricated, the CD has already had the data 
encoded therein and can be thus used as a read-only optical information 
medium. Usual practice is that the CD has an index indicating a recorded 
content and a variety of designs printed on the surface of the protective 
layer with use of a UV-curable or oily ink. These prints have been 
usually made by a printing means or procedure using transfer from a 
printing plate, such as screening printing, tampon printing or offset 
printing. These printing procedures are ones which are particularly  
 
suitable for so-called mass printing wherein the same pattern is printed 
in great number at one time. On the other hand, musical performance by amateur players has 
recently become enthusiastic. As a wide variety of amateur players are 
being taken part in such performance, it has become full of activities that 
amateur players individually make a relatively small number of CDs of 
their own work. These CD articles are created for the purposes, for 
example, of promotion, audition, test and setting up on their own 
expenses. Especially, because write-once optical information mediums 
which are so-called CD-WO and in which information can be written 
once by use of a laser beam and can be reproduced with use of a CD player 
have now been developed, such a self-made CD can be made more readily. 
Alternatively, in the field of computers, so-called CD-ROM has become 
popular. As the write-once optical information medium has spread, 
users have now started to set up CD-ROM using CD-WO. The protective
