<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrolytes, used in 
electroplating, in particular for depositing a metallic layer onto a 
substrate by making the substrate to be plated the cathode in an 
electrolytic bath. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
electroplating of hard coatings containing chromium onto surfaces of 
articles which should have prolonged service life especially under 
conditions of impact load, high wear and corrosion, e.g., components 
of drilling equipment, pressing, extrusion and injection 
moulding dies, pressure casting molds, etc. However, the present 
invention is not limited by the above applications and is also 
suitable for electroplating of chromium-based coatings onto many 
other articles for which operating conditions require improved wear 
resistance in combination with high plasticity and corrosion 
resistance, e.g., rotating shafts, cylinder linings, different 
machine parts, piston rings, camshafts, weapon barrels, etc.  Electroplating technology for deposition of hard coatings of 
chromium onto metallic or other substrates has been known at least 
since the first quarter of the twentieth century when this process 
was commercialized by the United Chromium Company. An example of the first electrolytes containing ions of 
hexavalent chromium and suitable for electroplating of chromium 
coatings is described, for example, in British patent document 
GB2372288. Since then electroplating technology has been 
extensively developed, and today, standard electrolyte is known and 
widely used for electroplating of chromium coatings. This 
electrolyte is described in ASTM B177-68. It contains 250-400 
g/liter of chromium anhydride and 2,5-4 g/liter of sulfuric acid. One of the important parameters associated with the 
electroplating process in general, and the composition of 
electrolyte in particular, is the current efficiency. This 
parameter is insufficient for most known electrolytes used for 
electroplating of chromium, including the above-mentioned standard 
electrolyte, since low current efficiency is accompanied by 
prolonged deposition time. There are known attempts to increase current efficiency by 
modification of the chemical composition of the electrolyte, e.g., 
by introducing ions of halogens into the electrolyte bath, as 
described in Israeli patent IL47041 or compounds of sulfur, as 
described in US patents US3943040 or US4406756.  One of the major requirements of an electrolyte is its ability 
to produce coatings with high wear and corrosion
