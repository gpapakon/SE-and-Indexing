<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to susceptors for use in
chemical vapour deposition (CVD) devices and, more
particularly, to susceptors made of a ceramic material
for use in plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition
devices.Chemical vapour deposition device have been used
for some time in the deposition of thin films on
semiconductor substrates. In such devices, a gas
containing the structural elements of the film
material to be formed is first fed into a chamber,
followed by heating the gas to induce a chemical
reaction to deposit the desired film on a
semiconductor substrate.In a typical single-wafer CVD device, the
platform that is used to hold the semiconductor
substrate in place for the deposition process is
called a susceptor. The susceptor is usually
constructed of a thin plate for low mass and a
surrounding rim for rigidity. At this time, the
diameter of a susceptor in a typical reaction vessel
is approximately 9" (228mm) while the diameters of
wafers being coated are 
normally 6" or 8" (152 or 203mm). The susceptor can
be made of graphite or aluminium coated with a silicon
carbide coating so that it can be heated to the
deposition temperature of the thin film without
significant distortion. Still others have proposed
methods of treating metal surfaces to improve their
durability at high temperatures. For instance,
U.S.-A-5,201,990 discloses a process for treating
aluminium surfaces in a vacuum apparatus with a plasma
consisting of a nitrogen-containing gas of either
nitrogen or ammonia.To select a suitable material for the susceptor
used in a CVD device, the following criteria must be
met. First, the thermal conductivity of the material
must be sufficiently high such that any distortion in
its dimensions and any deterioration in the material
at the high operating temperatures of the CVD device
is minimised. Secondly, when in situ plasma chamber
cleaning methods are utilised, the material used for
the susceptor must be resistant to any corrosive
effect of the plasma. Thirdly, the susceptor material
must be of high purity in order to preclude
contamination of the semiconductor substrate
impurities contained in the material.As a consequence, metallic materials that are
electrically conductive and that have high thermal
conductivity are conventionally used for the
susceptor. In particular, certain metal alloys of
nickel 
such as Monel™, Hastelloy™, etc., are frequently used for their
resistance to fluorine-containing plasma which is one of the highly
reactive plasmas often used in in-situ plasma chamber
