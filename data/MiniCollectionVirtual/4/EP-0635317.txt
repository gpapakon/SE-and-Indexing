<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for washing and/or heat treating profile strips (2) of elastic material, preferably for sealing vehicle doors and windows, having several containers (3, 4, 5) arranged in a line for accommodating treatment liquid, a device for guiding and transporting the profile strip (2) along the treatment liquid baths (11, 11', ...) in the individual containers, and pumps for delivering treatment liquid to nozzle arrangements (16, 17, 18, 19) via which treatment liquid can be sprayed onto the profile strip (2), the individual containers are provided with nozzle arrangements (21, 21' and 22, 22' resp.) in the area of passage ducts or sliding channels (8, 8', ... and 20, 20',..., resp.), connecting the individual containers to one another, for the transport of the profile strip (2) along the baths (11, 11', ...). Air flows delivered by fans and intended for drying and for separating the liquid can be blown via the nozzle arrangements (21, 21' and 22, 22' resp.) onto the profile strip (2). In this apparatus, each container has a pump allocated to it, which delivers the liquid to the nozzle arrangement allocated in each case to each container, and the treatment liquid discharging from the respective nozzle arrangement (16 to 19 and 16' to 19',..., resp.) flows back into the respectively allocated container.

Apparatus for cleaning workpieces, in particular
moulded strips (2) of elastic material, preferably for

sealing vehicle doors and windows, having a plurality
of tanks (3 to 6) arranged in a line for receiving

treatment liquid and having a device for guiding and
conveying the moulded Strip (2) along the treatment

liquid baths (11, 11', ...) contained in the
individual tanks (4, 6), having pumps (12 to 15) for

delivering treatment liquid to nozzle arrangements (16
to 19) for spraying the treatment liquid onto the

moulded strip (2), and having nozzle arrangements (21,
21' or 22, 22'), which are disposed in the region of

the through-channels or sliding conduits (8, 8', ...
or 20, 20', ...) connecting the tanks (3 to 6) to one

another and by means of which air streams delivered by
blowers (27 to 30) may be blown for drying and liquid

separation purposes onto the moulded strip (2),
wherein

associated with each tank (3 to 6) is a pump (12 to
15) which delivers the treatment liquid to the nozzle

arrangement (16 to 19) or 16' to 19', ...), which is
associated with each tank (3 to 6) and takes the form

of annular tubular pieces, and wherein the treatment
liquid exiting from the respective nozzle arrangement

(16 to 19 or 16' to 19', ...) flows back into the
respectively associated tank (3 to 6),

characterized in

that the nozzle arrangements (16, 17, 18 or 16', 17',
18' ...) are arranged in a straight line and in a

fixed manner on retaining plates (42, 42', ...), which
are in each case held stationary above the bath level

(11, 11', ...) inside each tank (3 to 6), each tubular
piece being provided with a pl
urality of nozzles (43,
43', ...), from which the treatment liquid emerges,

and the jet direction of said nozzles (43, 43', ...) 
being aligned in such a way that the moulded strip (2)

moving along the axis of rotation (X) of said tubular
pieces is hit directly on all sides by the liquid

jets, and that the nozzle arrangements (19, 19', ...)
are supported on the retaining plates (42, 42', ...)

so as to be in each case capable of swivelling about a
vertical axis y and additionally displaceable about

the axis of rotation x and are each provided with at
least one nozzle (44, 44', ...) which is connected to

the respective delivery pipe (35 to 38).
Apparatus according to claim 1,

characterized in

that the blowers (27 to 30) are connected by hose
pipes (23 to 26) to nozzle arrangements (21, 21', ...)

or 22, 22', ... or 40, 40', ...), which are formed in
each case by a pair of U-shaped tubular pieces which

in each case in the region between two tanks (3 to 6)
enclose the moulded strip (2) moving through the

apparatus along the axis of rotation (x), each tubular
piece and/or each nozzle arrangement (21, 21', ... or

22, 22', ... or 40, 40', ...) being provided with a
plurality of nozzles (38, 38', ... or 45, 45', ...)

which are orientated towards the axis of rotation x
and in the direction of the, in each case, adjacent

tank (3 to 6).
