<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to nucleic acid sequences encoding amino acid sequences of the  alpha ,  beta , and  gamma  subunits of the high affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E, and for amino acid sequences of the subunits. The invention further relates to a method of producing the receptor by expressing cDNA for its  alpha ,  beta , and  gamma  subunits in a host cell simultaneously. Aspects of the invention are methods and compositions to produce the human beta subunit, as well as to inhibit its function, thereby treating or preventing allergic reactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to DNA segments
encoding the α, β, and γ subunits of the high affinity
receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE), in particular the
human β subunit. The invention further relates to a
method of producing the receptor by expressing DNA
encoding its α, β and γ subunits in a host cell
simultaneously.Receptors that bind the Fc region of immunoglobulins
("Fc receptors") mediate immunoglobulin transport across
membranes, stimulate a variety of cellular activities
induced by antigen-antibody complexes, and possibly
regulate the biosynthesis of antibodies. Three of the
receptors (the receptor for polymeric immunoglobulin
(Mostov etal. (1984) Nature (London) 308:37-43), the Fc
receptors on macrophages and lymphocytes (Ravetch et al.
(1986) Science 234:718-725), and the high affinity Fc,
receptor on mast cells and basophils (Kinet etal. (1987)
Biochemistry 26:4605-4610; Shimizu etal. (1988) Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:1907-1911; Kochan etal. (1988)
Nucleic Acids Res. 16:3584) share a common feature: their
immunoglobulin-binding portion contains two or more
immunoglobulin-like domains.The high affinity IgE receptor FcεRI is responsible
for initiating the allergic response. Binding of
allergen to receptor-bound IgE leads to cell activation
and the release of mediators (such as histamine)
responsible for the manifestations of allergy. This
receptor is a tetrameric complex αβγ2 which is found on
the surface of mast cells and basophils. The α and β 
subunits have not been detected in other hematopoietic
cells although the γ chains of FceRI are found in
macrophages, NK cells and T cells where they associate
with the low affinity receptor for IgG (FcγRIII) or with
the T cell antigen receptor.The genes for α and γ, both have been localized on
human (Le Coniat, 1990) and mouse chromosome 1. (Huppi,
1988; Kinet et al. 1987; Kochan etal. 1988; Shimizu et
al. 1988; Ra etal. 1989.) The gene for mouse β has been
localized on mouse chromosome 19 and is believed to be a
single gene (Huppi, 1989). The structures of the a gene
in the rat (Tepler, 1989) and of the γ gene (Kuster,
1990), but not of the β gene have been characterized in
the human.The receptor with high affinity for IgE FcεRI is
found exclusively on mast cells, basophils, Langerhans -
cells, and related cells. Aggregation of IgE occupied
FcεRI by antigen triggers both the release of preformed
mediators such as histamine and serotonin, as well as
stimulation of the synthesis of leukotrienes. It is the
release of these mediators that results in
