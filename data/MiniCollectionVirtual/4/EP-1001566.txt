OFDMA signal transmission, a plurality of serial

signals is converted to parallel signals by a
plurality of serial/parallel converters, the

plurality of converted parallel signals are
rearranged at intervals of a power of 2 by a

rearranging apparatus, sub-carrier assignment is
performed, and inverse Fourier transform is performed with

respect to the number of sub-carriers, which has been varied
depending on the number of rearranged parallel signals, so as

to be changed to time waveforms. The transformed parallel
signals are converted to serial signals by the parallel/serial

converter, the converted serial signals are converted to
analog signals by D/A converter and orthogonal modulator,

thereafter converting the analog signals to high frequency
signals so as to be emitted. This configuration allows the

amount of operations and power consumption to be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an OFDMA
(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)
signal transmission apparatus and its method.In mobile communications, overcoming multipath
fading and improving transmission quality have been
conventionally present as problems to be solved. In
connection with the multipath fading, there is a
multi-carrier transmission as one of measures to
transmit data with a good quality without lowering
a symbol rate.OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing) is one of multi-carrier transmission
systems, that is, one that sets a distance between
adjacent sub-carriers to 1/symbol rate to allow the
distance between the sub-carriers to be narrowed at
the maximum.Also, OFDMA is a system in which a plurality
of users performs multiple access using OFDM. In
the conventional OFDMA data transmission apparatus,
there is proposed a method in which frequency
division and time division are carried out when
multiple access is performed. Also, it has been
considered that diversity is carried out in a
frequency direction and a time direction to make it 
possible to improve an error correction capability.FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing the
configuration of a transmission section in the
conventional OFDMA signal transmission apparatus.
FIG. 2 is a block diagram showing the configuration
of a reception section in the conventional OFDMA
signal transmission apparatus.A transmission section 10 shown in FIG. 1 mainly
comprises S/P (Serial/Parallel) converter 11, IFFT
(Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) apparatus 12, P/S
(Parallel/Serial) converter 13, a D/A (Digital/Analog)
converter and orthogonal modulator 14, a transmission
amplifier 15, and a transmission antenna 16.A reception section 60 shown in FIG. 2 mainly
comprises reception antenna 61, quasi-coherent
detector and A/D (Analog/Digital) converter 62, S/P
converter 63, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
apparatus 64, and P/S converter 65.An explanation will be given of the operation
of the conventional OFDM transmission and reception
in the OFDMA signal transmission apparatus having
the above-configured transmission section 10 and
reception section 60. In this case, it is assumed
that transmission section 10 and reception section
60 are provided in the base station of the mobile
communication system (not shown) and the mobile
station.First, an explanation will be given of the 
operation, which is performed when forward signals
are transmitted to the mobile station from the base
station. In the case of the forward OFDMA, the base
