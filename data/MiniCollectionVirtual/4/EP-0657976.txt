<ABSTRACT>
Laser cavity with passive Q-switching by saturable absorber (absorbent) and laser incorporating this cavity. This laser cavity includes a solid active medium (7, 12, 22, 21, 211, 213), a saturable absorber (8, 13, 21, 212), an input mirror (14) and an output mirror (15). The saturable absorbent is a thin layer of saturable absorbent material deposited directly onto the solid active medium. The laser includes such a cavity and means for pumping this cavity.

<CLAIMS>
Laser cavity comprising a solid, active laser medium (12, 22, 21, 211, 
213), a saturable absorber (13, 21, 212), an entrance mirror (14) and an exit 

mirror (15), 
characterized in that
 the saturable absorber is a thin saturable 
absorber material film deposited directly on said solid, active medium (12, 

22). 
Laser cavity according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the thin film is 
obtainable by liquid phase epitaxy. 
Laser cavity according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
refractive index of the saturable absorber film (8, 13, 21, 212) is adapted 

to the refractive index of the solid, active medium (12, 22, 211, 213). 
Laser cavity according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the thin film 
(13, 21, 212) is formed from a base material having an identical or similar 

crystal structure to that of the solid, active medium (7, 12, 22, 21, 211, 
213), said base material being doped with erbium, chromium, thulium or 

holmium ions. 
Laser cavity according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the cavity 
exit mirror (15) is directly deposited on the saturable absorber film (13). 
Laser cavity according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the entrance 
mirror (14) is directly deposited on the solid, active medium (12, 22). 
Laser cavity according to either of the claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in 
that
 the cavity has a waveguide structure. 
Laser cavity according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the active laser 
material is constituted by a first film (211). 
Laser cavity according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the saturable 
absorber film (212) is located between the first active laser medium film 

(211) and a second active laser medium film (213). 
Laser cavity according to claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the two active 
laser medium films (211, 212) is depositable by liquid phase epitaxy. 
Laser cavity according to claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the three thin 
films (211, 212, 213) have an index gradient so as to optimize guidance. 
Laser cavity according to claim 11, 
characterized in that
 the saturable 
absorber film (212) is formed from a base material having an identical or  

 
similar crystal structure to that of the solid, active medium (211, 213), 

said base material being doped with erbium, chromium, thulium or holmium 
ions. 
Laser incorporating a laser cavity according to one of the preceding 
claims and cavity pumping means.
