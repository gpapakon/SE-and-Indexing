<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic
composite material which has a high mechanical strength
and an excellent creep resistance in a wide temperature
range from room temperature to high temperature and is
suitable to be used as a structural material at a high
temperature.SiC or Si3N4 has been investigated to develop
ceramic materials to be used at high temperatures but is
not sufficient in high temperature properties. As an
alternative material thereof, SiC/SiC composite materials
produced by chemical vapor impregnation, provided by
Societe Europeene de Propulsion, have attracted
attention, at the present are considered to be the best
high temperature structural materials and have been
investigated and developed. The temperature range at
which they can be used is reported to be 1400°C or lower.T. Parthasarathy et al. in Journal of the
American Ceramics Society Vol. 76, No. 1, pp29 - 32
(1993) disclosed a composite of alumina and yttrium
aluminum garnet (sometime hereinafter referred to as
"YAG") of eutectic Al2O3-Y3Al5O12. T. Parthasarathy et al.
also disclose a method of producing the composite by
unidirectionally melting and solidifying a mixed powder
of Al2O3 and Y2O3 in a crucible.It is comprehensible from the description on
page 29, right column, lines 9 to 10 and Figs. 1 and 2 of
the literature that the composite is polycrystalline and
includes grain boundaries. This is clearly supported
from the description "The failure was usually along the
colony boundaries with crack running along the Al2O3-YAG 
interface boundaries". These colony boundaries are shown
as portions where the microstructure is larger than in
the other portions in Fig. 2 of the literature.This composite material has stresses equivalent
to those of sapphire at 1530°C and 1650°C when the strain
rate was make constant.Moreover, the present investors confirmed in
experiments that the composite disclosed by
Mr. Parthasarathy et al. includes pores or voids in the
microstructure and the mechanical strength of the
composite rapidly lowers at high temperature.Therefore, the object of the present invention
is to provide a ceramic composite material comprising
polycrystal α-Al2O3 and polycrystal Y3Al5O12 and a ceramic
composite material comprising single crystal α-Al2O3 and
polycrystal Y3Al5O12, which have an excellent mechanical
strength and creep behavior from room temperature to high
temperature and significantly improved these properties
particularly at high temperature.The above object is attained in accordance with the
present
