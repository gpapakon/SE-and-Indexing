<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a peptide having
affinity with inflammatory cells and its derivatives or
chemically modified substances. The present invention also
relates to a radioactive diagnostic useful for diagnosing
inflammation sites in living body of mammals including human,
which comprises the above peptide and a radioactive metal
label for the peptide.The term "inflammation" covers so-called
inflammatory responses wholly, including those caused by
infectious diseases or on the periphery of tumors.
Inflammation is induced by physical or chemical reactions due
to heat, radiant energy, chemical substances, mechanical
trauma or the like, and is also noted on infectious diseases
caused by invasion into living bodies of foreign substances
such as virus and bacteria, or on the periphery of tumors
resulting from, for example, mutation of DNA. Inflammation is
a series of reactions initiated by reaction of tissue cells
subjected to inflammatory stimuli and by subsequent reactions
in microcirculation system, particularly with protein
permeation through blood vessels, followed by exudation and
infiltration of leukocytes and granuloma formation to healing;
it may be regarded as a biological defense reaction of the
host for preventing foreign substance from invading into the
living body or for normalizing inflammation sites.Known radioactive diagnostic agents for imaging
inflammations in living body including those caused by
infectious diseases or on the periphery of tumors include
gallium-67 citrate (Takashi Onishi, Nuclear Medicine (Kaku
Igaku), Vol. 26, pp 1371-9, 1989), radioactive metal labeled
polyclonal antibodies (JP-A-63502280 of Rabin. R. H et al, and
Frans. H. M et al, Seminars in Nuclear Medicine, Vol 13, No.
2, April, pp 148 - 164, 1993), and radiolabeled leukocytes 
(Kazuo Ito, Nuclear Medicine (Kaku Igaku), Vol. 24, pp 341 -
51, 1987).Gallium-67 citrate contains gallium-67 which has a
long half-life of 3.26 days, and the radioactive metal labeled
polyclonal antibodies perse are also long in half-life in
blood; thus both agents make the radioactive metal stay in the
body for a long period of time giving unnecessary exposure to
the patient. Furthermore, imaging takes 20 hours or longer
with both agents. Thus, it has been impossible to get
diagnostic information quickly for patients in immediate need
of treatment.Radiolabeled leukocyte diagnostic has been used in
clinical practice as highly advanced medical care. However,
this diagnostic requires a complicated procedure with advanced
skill in
