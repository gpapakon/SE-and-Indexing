<ABSTRACT>
The tuning method involves using an air coil encased by an impregnating element which softens and flows-off at the soldering temperature. The air coil is mounted using conventional SMD-technology assembly devices e.g. suction pipette. The inductivity of the air coil is adjusted by altering the winding spacing to achieve the desired frequency. If necessary after adjusting the inductivity, the windings are fixed in their adjusted position by forming a second impregnating element, to avoid microphony.

Method for tuning an oscillatory circuit constructed 
in SMD technology or an electrical filter using highfrequency 

technology, wherein the oscillatory circuit 
comprises a surface-mountable capacitor whose capacitance 

cannot be varied and a surface-mountable air coil whose 
inductance can be aligned, characterized in that 


an air coil is used which is completely or partially 
enclosed by a first impregnating agent which 

volatilizes or softens at the soldering temperature 
and completely or partly drains away, 
said air coil is manipulable and mountable using 
conventional devices which are standard in SMD 

technology, such as, for example, suction pipettes, 
during the soldering operation, the said first 
impregnating agent volatilizes completely or partly or 

softens and completely or partly drains away, 
the inductance of the air coil is adjusted by changing 
the turn spacing to achieve the desired frequency, and 
if necessary, fixing the turns in their set position 
to avoid microphony after adjusting the inductance by 

applying a second impregnating agent. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
first impregnating agent volatilizes or softens at a 

temperature of 
>
 200Â°C. 
Method according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the gaseous, first impregnating agent volatilized 

during the soldering operation is sucked off. 
Method according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the first impregnating agent is, for example, an 

adhesive wax.  
 
Method according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the second impregnating agent is composed, for 

example, of lacquer, wax, adhesive or another substance 
suitable for fixing the position of wire turns. 
Method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the second impregnating agent is 

applied to the aligned air coils by hand or automatically 
by means of a suitable device.
