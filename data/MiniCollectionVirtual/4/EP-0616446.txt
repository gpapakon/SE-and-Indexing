<ABSTRACT>
A timing extracting circuit according to the present 
invention includes a trailing edge detection circuit for 

detecting a trailing edge of a CMI signal. A trailing 
edge detection pulse is supplied to an AND gate and to 

a series circuit composed of a 3/2T delay circuit and 
a 2T delay circuit through an inverter. A 3/2T delayed, 

a T delayed and a 2T delayed outputs are supplied to the 
AND gate whose output is supplied to an OR gate and a 

9T delay circuit. A T to 9T delayed outputs of the 9T 
delay circuit are also supplied to the OR gate and an 

extracted clock is obtained at an output of the OR gate. 
Trailing edge detection pulse of violation is removed by 

the AND gate and the thus removed regular detection pulse 
is supplemented by the OR gate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a timing extracting 
circuit for a coded mark inversion (CMI) signal and, 
particularly, to a timing extracting circuit for such 
CMI signal containing CMI rule violation in a CMI code 
strain. With an increased speed of information processing 
caused by recent development of information processing 
devices, improvement on efficiency and speed of data 
transmission between information processing devices have 
been requested. In view of these requests, the optical 
transmission has been utilized in which high speed data is 
transmitted through optical fibers. In general, in order 
to transmit data, the data is converted into a transmitting 
code train suitable for transmission through a transmission 
path such as optical fibers. CMI code is one of these transmitting code trains, 
whose coding rule is as follow: that is, an input data 
"0" to be transmitted is converted into "01" and an input 
data "1" is converted alternatively into "00" and "11. 
On a decoding side, "01" is decoded to "0", a series of 
alternating "00" and "11", without "01" is decoded to "1" 
and otherwise be violation.  An example of violation is a sectioning information 
for indicating sections of data to be transmitted or other 
information such as those to be superimposed. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 3-145834 
discloses an example of a construction of a clock timing 
extracting circuit for a CMI signal train containing 
violation. In the conventional construction of the timing 
extracting circuit for CMI code, however, it is based 
on that CMI code includes CMI coded signals "0" and "1" 
which occur at least twice preceeding its violation. 
Therefore, when a service data signal which is very low 
compared with a transmission speed of a main signal is 
transmitted by violation of the CMI code train, it is 
impossible to extract a timing exactly. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
timing extracting circuit for extracting a timing signal 
of the CMI code, which is capable of extracting the timing 
precisely regardless of the relation between the CMI code 
and the violation. The timing extracting circuit of the present invention 
utilizes the fact that an interval between a normal training 
edge of the CMI signal and a trailing edge due to "10" of 
violation is (7/2)T at maximum. The timing extracting  
 
circuit according to the present invention includes a 
detection pulse producing circuit for producing a detection 
pulse by detecting a timing of level change of the
