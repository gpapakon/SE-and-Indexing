<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a filter fabric consisting of a core yarn having a reversible stretch of at least 20 to 50 %, the fabric being intended for use in the manufacture of airbags for vehicles. The yarn consists of a thermally stable thermoplastic core filament yarn (1) round which is braided or spun a heat-resistant outer layer (2) or which is coated, or coated by vapour deposition, with a heat-resistant layer (2).
