<ABSTRACT>
Air chamber-type air pallets (10) incorporate side-to-side linked air pressurized tubes or chambers (46-64) in two integrated rows, having common members (14, 16) for adjacent chambers under air pressurization rendered rigid over a certain extent to rigidify the air chambers thereof which form load backing chambers in place of rigid backing members conventionally employed in air pallets maintaning the load (P) footprint borne by the air pressurized backing chambers matched by that of the developed air bearing or air film (A) by passage of compressed air through the pattern of perforations (26). Preferably, linked tubes (44-54) of one row are laterally offset but integrated physically to those (56-64) of a second row to both limit lateral shrinkage of linked tubes (44-64) extending completely across the pin hole perforations (26) within the thin, flexible bottom sheet (18) partially forming such air pallets. A single row of linked tubes (306) formed of two thin, flexible sheets (302, 304), acting as plenum chambers and having perforations (316) within the thin, flexible bottom sheet (304) functions adequately to support the patient (P) directly on the top thin, flexible sheeet (302) with the bottom tangential surfaces of the individual tubes (306) flattening.

<DESCRIPTION>
 AIR CHAMBER TYPE PATIENT MOVERField Of The InventionThis invention relates to air pallets, and more particularly to air pallet-type patient movers for facilitating comfortable support of and transfer of patients and more particularly to a semi-rigid air pallet in which a series of parallel, compressed air filled tubes or the like form one or more backing chambers which function as a generally rigid backing member. Background Of The InventionThe present invention is an outgrowth of the development of an air pallet using low pressure, low cfm air flow exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 3,948,344 entitled, "LOW COST PLANAR AIR PALLET MATERIAL HANDLING SYSTEM", issued April 6, 1976, and U.S. Patent No. 4,272,856 entitled, "DISPOSABLE AIR-BEARING PATIENT MOVER AND VALVE EMPLOYED THEREIN", issued June 16, 1981, assigned to the common assignee. Planar air pallets and air-bearing patient movers of such type employ at least a thin flexible bottom sheet for partially defining a plenum chamber, with said one sheet being perforated by way of small, closely spaced pin holes over a surface area defined by the imprint of the load, which pin holes face an underlying fixed, generally planar support surface. The pin holes open unrestrictedly to the interior of the plenum chamber and to the planar support surface. When the plenum chamber is pressurized by low pressure air, initially the air jacks the load upwardly above the thin flexible sheet, then air escapes under pressure through the minute pin holes and creates a frictionless air bearing of relatively small height between the underlying support surface and the bottom of the perforated flexible sheet.In all air pallets, including patient movers, it is necessary to provide controlled pillowing of the thin, flexible sheet material, particularly outside the perforated surface area of that sheet to initially jack the load above the flexible sheet prior to the creation of the frictionless air bearing and to insure the ability of the air pallet to ride over surface 

 projections on the underlying support surface. Means must also be provided within the air pallet to prevent ballooning of the thin flexible sheet or flexible sheets defining the plenum chamber whereby the plenum chamber takes a circular or near circular vertical cross section, the result of which could be the tilting or rolling of the load off the top of the air pallet. Further, when the load rests on the air pallet, prior to the pressurization of the plenum chamber the load tends to press the perforated flexible
