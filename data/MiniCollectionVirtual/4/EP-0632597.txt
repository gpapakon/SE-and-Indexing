<ABSTRACT>
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus for recording 
and/or reproducing digital audio signal on a recording medium 

such as a magnetic tape, which includes a recording and/or 
reproducing unit, an analog-to-digital convertor, a decimation 

filter, and noise shaper. The recording and/or reproducing 
unit records and/or reproduces signal on a recording medium at 

a speed double relative moving speed of a head and the 
recording medium at least. The analog-to-digital convertor 

converts input analog audio signal into digital signal with a 
sampling frequency which is above the audio frequency band, and 

sufficiently higher than the maximum frequency capable of 
recording by the recording and/or reproducing unit. The 

decimation filter reduces the sampling frequency of the digital 
signal output from the analog-to-digital convertor, and 

converts it into digital signal of m-bit (m 
>
 n). The noise 
shaper converts the digital signal from the decimation filter 

from m-bit to n-bit, and then in requantizing, shapes noise so 
as to suppress within the audio frequency band, and supplies it 

to the recording and/or reproducing unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an audio signal transmitting
apparatus and the method thereof, and more particularly to an
improvement of an audio signal transmitting apparatus which is
applicable to a recording and/or reproducing apparatus for
recording and/or reproducing audio signal on a recording
medium.A digital audio tape recorder generally converts audio
signal into digital signal and records the signal on a magnetic
tape to record and/or reproduce audio signal with high tone
quality.This digital audio tape recorder samples audio signals
input sequentially at a sampling frequency of 48 [kHz] or 44.1
[kHz], and performs analog-to-digital conversion to convert the
audio signal into 16-bit digital signal.A frequency of 20 [Hz] to 20 [kHz] is known to be the
human audio frequency band in general. Accordingly, the
digital audio tape recorder selects any of the above sampling
frequency so that audio signal can be converted into digital
signal at a frequency band almost equal to the human audio
frequency band.The digital audio tape recorder
divides the digital signal 
into specified blocks, adds an error correction code to each block,
and interleaves the signal to generate record data.The tape recorder uses this record data to drive a magnetic
head to sequentially record the record data on a magnetic tape.After converting into binary data, reproducing signal output
from the magnetic head in reproducing, the digital audio tape
recorder performs procedure reverse that performed in recording to
demodulate the original audio signal. Thereby, in the digital
audio tape recorder, the deterioration of the tone quality can be
effectively avoided in recording and reproducing.In this type of digital audio tape recorder, a digital audio
tape recorder (hereinafter referred to as "double-speed recording
and reproducing digital audio tape recorder") has been proposed in
which the rotating speed of a rotary drum is set to a value double
the normal speed, and also the running speed of a magnetic tape is
set to a value double the normal speed, so that audio signal with
a higher tone quality can be recorded and/or reproduced.In this double-speed recording and/or reproducing digital
audio tape recorder, the sampling frequency can be set to a value
double the normal frequency of the digital audio tape recorder,
thus the recordable and reproducible frequency band can be
increased to twice the width of the normal digital audio tape
recorder.Therefore, the double-speed recording and/or reproducing
digital audio tape recorder can set
