<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming channel stop implants in semiconductor 
integrated circuits is disclosed. Patterned polysilicon (e.g., 17, 13) and silicon 

nitride (e.g., 19, 15) layers are formed upon a silicon substrate (e.g., 11). Silicon 
dioxide spacers (e.g., 23, 25) are next formed adjacent the patterned polysilicon (e.g., 

17, 13) and silicon nitride layers (e.g., 19, 15). Next, a channel stop implantation is 
performed (e.g., 31). The spacers (e.g., 17, 13) restrict the size of the chan stop 

implantation. The spacers are subsequently removed and a thermal heat treatment is 
performed to create the field oxides (e.g., 63). Because the width of the chan stop 

implants was initially restricted, subsequent lateral diffusion is not harmful.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of integrated circuit fabrication. Typical silicon integrated circuits include many transistors which are 
separated from each other by a field oxide. An ion implant (generally of the same 
type as the tub implant if a tub process is used) is formed beneath the field oxide. 
The ion implant formed beneath the field oxide is often termed a channel stop or 
"chan stop." The chan stop implant prevents the formation of a parasitic MOS 
device created by runners which may overlie the field oxide. More precisely, chan 
stop implants raise the concentration of the tub area beneath the field oxide and 
thereby increase the threshold voltage of the parasitic field MOS device and also 
reduce the punch-through tendency of the adjacent source/drain regions of adjacent 
transistors. A disadvantage of the chan stop implant is that the dopant species used 
to form the implant laterally diffuses into an adjacent n or p MOS device. This 
lateral diffusion may increase the threshold voltage of adjacent MOS devices or 
reduce the current drive capability of adjacent MOS devices. Unfortunately, lateral 
diffusion of the chan stop implant species is often a byproduct of thermal processing 
which is performed after the chan stop implantation is performed. The undesirable lateral diffusion of the chan stop implant species is 
controlled by the present invention which utilizes spacers to make the initial width of 
the chan stop implant smaller. Illustratively, the invention includes:
 
forming at least one patterned layer on a substrate and then forming at least one 
spacer adjacent one side of the patterned layer. Then a dopant species is directed at 
the exposed portion of the substrate, thereby forming an implant region in the 
substrate. The spacer is then removed and the substrate is oxidized, thereby causing 
the implant region to diffuse. Then the patterned layer is removed and a transistor is 
formed upon the substrate. The dopant species forms the chan stop beneath the 
oxidized portion of the substrate. However, the initial width of the implant is 
narrower than in previous practice. Consequently, the subsequent diffusion of the 
implant species during the oxidation process does not produce any deleterious 
effects.  FIGS. 1-5 are cross-sectional views helpful in understanding an 
illustrative embodiment of the present invention. Turning to FIG. 1, reference numeral 11 denotes a substrate which may, 
illustratively, be silicon, doped silicon, epitaxial silicon, etc. In general, the
