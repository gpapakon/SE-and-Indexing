<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to substituted pyrroles. More
particularly, the invention is concerned with compounds of the
general formula I

   wherein R1 represents lower alkyl, lower cycloalkyl, aryl or
lower aralkyl, R2 represents hydrogen, aryl or lower alkyl
optionally substituted by hydroxy, acyloxy, amino, mono(lower
alkyl)amino, di(lower alkyl)amino, carboxy, lower
alkoxycarbonyl or aminocarbonyl and m and n stand for 1 or 2,
as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic compounds of
formula I with bases and of basic compounds of formula I with acids.Objects of the present invention are the compounds of formula I
and their aforementioned salts per se and as therapeutically active
substances; a process for the manufacture of said compounds and salts
and novel intermediates useful in said process; medicaments
containing said compounds and salts and the manufacture of these
medicaments; and the use of said compounds and salts in the control
or prevention of illnesses, especially in the control or prevention of
inflammatory, immunological, oncological, bronchopulmonary,
dermatological and cardiovascular disorders, in the treatment of
asthma, AIDS or diabetic complications or for the stimulation of hair
growth, or for the manufacture of a medicament against
inflammatory, immunological, oncological, bronchopulmonary, 
dermatological and cardiovascular disorders or against asthma, AIDS
or diabetic complications or for the stimulation of hair growth. EP-A-0 384 349 discloses various bisindolyl maleimedes which basically
contain an additional tetrahydropyrido, tertahydroazepino or
tetrahydropyrazino moiety which can be substituted in one position of said
moiety.Bit et al., J. Med. Chem. 36, 1, 21-29 (1993), describe the chemical
synthesis of bisindolyl maleimides having an additional tetrahydropyrrolo,
tetrahydroazepino or tetrahydropyrido ring substituted with an aminoalkyl
group.EP-A-0 470 490 discloses bisindolyl maleimides having an additional
cycloalkyl ring which is further substituted with a cycloalkyl or aza-cycloalkyl
group.The compounds of the present invention differ from the prior art
compounds in having at least a different substituent attached to the
tetrahydropyrrolo, -pyrido or -azepino ring. As used herein, the term "lower alkyl", alone or in combination,
means a straight-chain or branched-chain alkyl group containing 1-6
carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec.butyl,
tert.butyl, pentyl and the like. The term "lower alkoxy", alone or in
combination,
