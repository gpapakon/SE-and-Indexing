<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and to an apparatus for connecting and sealing a lateral inflow (2) to a liner (3) in a main duct (1) to be repaired, the liner (3) being provided, in the region of the lateral inflow (2), with a correspondingly aligned bore (4). A thermoplastic connection stub (5) is introduced into the lateral bore (4) of the liner (3) until it passes into the lateral inflow (2). The connection stub is heated up to the melting point of its material and is widened from the inside until its outer wall bears closely against the inner wall (2a) of the lateral inflow (2) and against the bore (4) in the liner (3). Moreover, the connection stub (5), by heating it up correspondingly, is intimately welded to the liner (3).

A process for connecting and sealing a side infeed to a main channel which
has been repaired with an inliner of synthetic material, there being made in the

inliner a lateral bore aligned with respect to the side infeed and a pipe section of
thermoplastic synthetic material being introduced through the lateral bore in the

inliner into the side infeed, being heated and then being expanded from the inside by
an expander (10), which is introduced into the interior of the pipe section (5, 25) and

actuated by pressurised medium, until its outer wall abuts snugly against the bore (4)
in the inliner (3) and the inner wall (2a) of the side infeed (2),
characterised in that
 the pipe section (5, 25) is made from a thermoplastic synthetic
material which has the same welding factor as the synthetic material of the inliner

(3), and
in that
 the pipe section (5, 25) is welded internally to the inliner (3) by further heating.
A process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the heating and/or
welding of the pipe section (5, 25) is performed by electrical heating wires (7, 8; 27)

arranged in the pipe section.
A process according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the heating wires (7) of
the pipe section (5) are arranged to be more concentrated in the welding region than

the heating wires (8) in the region coming to lie in the side infeed (2).
A process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the pipe section (5, 25)
is heated from the inside by an expander (10) equipped with a corresponding heating

means (17).
A process according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the pipe section (5, 25)
is heated from the inside by the expander (10) equipped with a corresponding

heating means (17), whereas the pipe section (5, 25) is welded to the inliner (3) by
electrical heating wires (7, 8; 27) arranged in the pipe section (5, 25). 
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 a cylindrical
pipe section (5) is used and the welding to the inliner (3) is performed in the region of

the bore (4).
A process according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that
 once the welding has
been performed the part of the welded-in pipe section (5) projecting inwards beyond

the inner wall of the inliner (3) is milled off flush.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 a pipe
section (25) is used which, comprising a cylindrical part (26) and an integrally formed

flange (28) which is matched to the curvature of the inliner (3), is used to bear
against the inside of the inliner (3), and 
in that
 the welding to the inliner (3) is
performed in the region in which the flange (28) bears against the inliner (3) with the

application of a contact pressure device (30).
A process according to Claims 5 and 8, 
characterised in that
 the electrical
heating wires (27) are arranged in the flange (28) in an annular formal ion around the

cylindrical part (26).
A process according to Claim 8 or 9, 
characterised in that
 a cylindrical insert
(21) of a thermoplastic material having low recovery, for example PVC, is inserted

into the cylindrical part (26) of the pipe section (25) and covers the region of
transition from the pipe section (25) to the side infeed (2) in sealing manner, and 
in
that
 the expander (10) actuated by pressurised medium heats and widens both the
cylindrical insert (21) and the cylindrical part (26) of the pipe section (25).
A process according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that
 before insertion both
end regions of the cylindrical insert (21) are provided on the outside with sealing

rings or bands (22) which seal off the insert (21) towards the pipe section (25) and
towards the side infeed (2).
A process according to Claim 11, 
characterised in that
 sealing bands (22) are
glued onto the two end regions of the cylindrical insert (21). 
A process according to Claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that
 a pipe section (5) is
used which, at the end region coming to lie in the side infeed (2), is provided with an

outer annular groove (9) in which a sealing ring (6) is laid.
A process according to one of the preceding claims, in which neither the
inliner (3) in the main channel (1) nor the side infeed (2) is accessible, 
characterised
in that
 the individual steps of connection are carried out by remote control by a robot
carriage introduced into the inliner (3).
