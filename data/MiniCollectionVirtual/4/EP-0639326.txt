<ABSTRACT>
The fluid pressure controlling apparatus, a solenoid pulsator for 
milking machines, consists of a 

substantially fluid tight chamber having three ports (8,9,12)
 

   an arm (13) disposed, at least in part, in this 
chamber capable of being moved between positions closing either the 

first or second port (8,9) and a
 

   spring (15) to bias the arm to close either the second port (8) or 
first port (9) (preferably the second part). 
A solenoid is capable to move the arm (13) closing the first 
port. When the arm (13) closes the second port (8), the first port (9,12) 

are in communication via chamber(s), and, when the arm (13) closes the 
first port (9), 

the second and third ports (8,12) are in communication via said 
chamber(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in and/or relating to a 
vacuum solenoid and/or other means and methods applicable in the control of 
periodic or pulsed pressure differentials involving fluids, whether air or otherwise. A control of pressure or pressure differentials is frequently required and one 
common situation where such control is required is in the vacuum circuit of milking 
machinery. Such prior art structures have, from time to time, connected a vacuum 
or a first pressure line and/or an atmospheric or second pressure line to a controlled 
pressure line and provided either communication or no communication between the 
three on a controlled basis. Frequently, the control is under the action of an 
electrically or magnetically controlled shuttle or plunger. The present invention relates to apparatus and related means and/or 
methods that provide an alternative to such systems, whether for use in milking 
machinery or in other situations where there is to be a control axis to or from a 
source of fluid pressure or pressure differential. In a first aspect, the present invention consists in fluid pressure controlling 
apparatus comprising:
 
   housing means defining at least one substantially fluid tight chamber having 
first, second and third ports;
 
   an arm disposed, at least in part, in said at least one substantially fluid tight 
chamber capable of being moved between positions which closes either said first or 
second ports;
 
   means to bias the said arm to close either said second port or said first port 
(preferably said second part); and
 
   electrically actuable means capable of moving said arm to close said first 
port, and wherein, when said arm closes said second port, said first and third ports  
 
are in communication via said chamber(s), and, said arm closes said first port, 
said second and third ports are in communication via said chamber(s). Preferably, said first port is a vacuum port for connection to the vacuum line 
of a milk machine. Preferably, said second port is to the atmosphere. Preferably, said third port (the "controlled port") is connected to a vacuum 
line in communication with a controlled part of a milking system. In other forms of the present invention, other types of pressure differential 
to that just defined can exist. Preferably, said arm is pivoted between said conditions but in other forms, 
preferably said arm is deformable. Preferably, said means to bias said arm to close said second port is a spring. Preferably, said spring acts on

port") is connected to a vacuum line in communication with a controlled part of a 

milking system. 
Apparatus of any preceding claim wherein said arm is pivoted between said 
conditions. 
Apparatus of any preceding claim wherein said means to bias said arm to 
close said second port is a spring. 
Apparatus of Claim 6 wherein said spring acts on the arm at a region which 
extends in a different direct from a pivoting thereof to that region or regions which 

provide for the sealing of said first or second ports. 
Apparatus of any preceding claim wherein a sealing material is applied or 
attached to said arm to provide an appropriate seal of said first and/or second ports. 
Apparatus of any preceding claim wherein said housing means includes 
nipples extending outwardly from said first and third ports to facilitate attachment 

thereof to conduits, hoses, etc. 
Apparatus of any preceding claim wherein said arm is ferromagnetic and 
said electrical actuable means includes or is a solenoid. 
A fluid pressure controlling apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim 
operatively connected into the pulsation system of a milking machine such that, in 

use, a vacuum can be applied into a milk claw from said pulsation system, controlled 
by said controlled (third) port with the control being by electrical actuation/de-actuation 

of a solenoid which is, or of, said electrical actuable means, and 
wherein said second port is to the atmosphere and said third port is to a vacuum 

source.
