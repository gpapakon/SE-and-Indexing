<ABSTRACT>
By carrying out the conjugation of the antiviral drugs such as ara-AMP, acyclovir and the like with a carrier selected among basic polyaminoacids and, particularly, with poly-L-lysine or poly-L-ornythine wherein the major part of the amino groups, which are not substituted by antiviral drugs, are substituted by galactose molecules, the intramuscular administration of the drug without antibodies formation, without acute toxicity and with a hepatic targeting, is made possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to compounds with antiviral activity and, more
particularly to conjugated compounds of antiviral drug with carriers having
hepatotropic activity.In the treatment of the infection caused by viruses, the side effects produced by
antiviral drugs can be reduced with the adoption of the chemotherapeutic
lysosomotropic approach (Balboni PG, Minia A, Grossi MP, Barbanti-Brodano G,
Mattioli A, Fiume L., Activity of albumin conjugates of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine and
cytosine arabinoside on poxviruses as a lysosomotropic approach to antiviral
chemotherapy, Nature 1976; 264: 181-183).This consists in conjugating the drug to a macromolecule that is selectively captured
from the infected cells and transported in the lysosomes therefrom.If, as desired, the lysosomal enzymes break the linkage between the carrier and the
drug, the latter results as being concentrated in a pharmacological active form within
the infected cells.The chronic hepatitis by B (HBV) virus and by C (HCV) virus are a proper target
for this chemotherapeutic approach because: (a) these viruses grow especially in the
hepatocytes; (b) hepatocytes specifically bring inside and transport in the lysosomes
some glycoproteins with galactose residues that can therefore function as hepatotropic
vectors of drugs; (c) the conjugates of drug/glycoproteins can easily come into
contact with the surface of the hepatocites inasmuch the hepatic sinusoid are not a
barrier for proteins.Following this approach and to reduce its neurotoxic side effects, the arabinoside
adenine monophosphate antiviral drug (ara-AMP), active against HBV (Jacyna MR,
Thomas HC., Antiviral therapy: Hepatitis B., Brit Med Bull 1990; 46: 369-382), has
been conjugated with asialophetuin (AF) (Fiume L; Mattioli A, Busi C, Balboni PC,
Barbanti-Brodano G, De Vries J, Altman R, Wieland Th., Selective inhibition of
Ectromelia virus DNA synthesis in hepatocytes by adenine-9-β-D-arabinofuranoside
(ara-A) and adenine-β-D-arabinofuranoside 5'-monophosphate (ara-AMP) conjugated
to asialofetuin, FEBS LEtters 1980; 116: 185-188) and with the lactosaminated
albumin (L-SA) (Fiume L, Busi C, Mattioli A, Balboni PG, Barbanti-Brodano G.,
Hepatocyte targeting of adenine-9-β-D-arabinofuranoside 5'-monophosphate (ara-AMP)
coupled to lactosaminated albumin, FEBS Lett 1981; 129: 261-264; Fiume L, Bassi B,

chemically stable conjugate of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-monophosphate with
