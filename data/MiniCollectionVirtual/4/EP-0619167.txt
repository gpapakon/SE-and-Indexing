<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pocket knife having a plurality of operational parts (4, 4', 4''), especially knife blades, screwdriver attachments, can openers, nail files, corkscrews and the like which are arranged between two outside plates, each having a covering sheet (2) and at least one middle plate (3) and are connected to one another by means of clinch belts (5) which serve at least partially as pivots for the operational parts (4, 4', 4''), the operational parts (4, 4', 4'') interacting with spring pieces (6) which are arranged between the plates (3) and effect non-positive locking of the operational parts (4, 4', 4'') in the final positions. In order to effect positive fastening of at least one operational part (4', 4'') in its position of use in two opposite loading directions, while retaining the known structure of a pocket knife of the type described above, it is proposed according to the invention that the middle plate (3) include at least one resilient part (7) which acts transversely to the plane of the plate and brings about positive locking of the relevant operational part (4', 4'') in the position of use in the final position of one of the operational parts (4', 4'') by making the end face (7a) rest in a positive manner against a contact surface (4b) of the operational part (4', 4'').
