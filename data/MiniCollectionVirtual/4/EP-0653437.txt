<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process for producing AZT (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine) 
and derivatives thereof. The process makes 

use of a reduction step wherein a 2'-halo-5'-protected 
pyrimidinyl 2'-deoxyribonucleoside compound is reduced in an 

ether, ester, or ketone solvent. Also, the process makes use of a 
displacement step wherein a 3'α-sulfonyl group is displaced 

with an azido group in the presence of a lithium salt and a base.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for preparing 
AZT and derivatives thereof. The compound AZT (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine) and 
derivatives thereof are known to be useful for treating viral and 
bacterial infections, most notably in the treatment of AIDS (see, 
for example, U.S. Patents 4,724,232, 4,828,838, 4,847,244, 4,874,609, 
4,874,751, 4,818,750, 5,093,114 and 5,145,840). In the past, AZT has 
been made from an expensive starting material, thymidine (see 
Horwitz, J. P., et al., J. Org. Chem., 1964, 29, 2076; Maillard, M. 
Farag, A., Frappier, F., Florent, J. C., Grierson, D. S., Monneret, 
C., Tetrahedron Lett., 1989, 30, 1955; U.S. Patent 5,041,543 and DE 
3,705,794). Another known approach for preparing AZT features the 
coupling between an azido substituted carbohydrate precursor 
with an activated thymine base (see, Chu, C. K., Beach, J. W., 
Ullas, G. V., Kosugi, Y., Tetrahedron Lett., 1988, 29, 5349; Chu, C. 
K., WO 9001492 A1, Feb. 1990; Fleet, G. W. J., Son, J. C., Derome, 
A. E., Tetrahedron, 1988, 44, 625; Wengel, J., Pedersen, E. B., 
Synthesis, 1991, 451; Hager, M. W., Liotta, D. C., J. Am. Chem. 
Soc., 1991, 113, 5117; Jung, M. E., Gardiner, J. M., J. Org. Chem., 
1991, 56, 2614; and Sugimura, H., Osumi, K., Yamazaki, T., 
Yamaya, T., Tetrahedron Lett., 1991, 32, 1813). A third approach employs D-xylose (see, U.S. Patent 
4,916,218, Japanese Patent 63255295, European Patent 295090, and 
U.S. Patent 4,921,950) or D-glucofuranose (see, Hrebabecky, H., 
Holy, A., Carbohydr. Res., 1991, 216, 179) as starting material, 
using the 2'-α-hydroxy group (in carboxylic ester form) to direct 
the base coupling to give the required β-anomer. Although the 
glycosidic stereoselectivity of this reaction is high, the lengthy 
selective protection and deprotection of the sugar moieties 
remained a problem, in addition to the expensive reagents used 
in these processes.  
 WO-A-93/07162 discloses a process for the preparation of 
nucleoside derivatives especially AZT using as starting 
material a compound having the formula : 
 
wherein a carbon atom is directly bonded to the ribose 
ring whereas in the invention, the starting material has 
a moiety "RCO2-" with an oxygen bonded directly to the 
ribose ring.  
 The inventors have discovered a new, economical and 
highly efficient process for producing AZT and 
derivatives thereof as well as key intermediates. The present invention makes use of key intermediate 
steps. One such intermediate step can be described as a 
process for reduction of a
