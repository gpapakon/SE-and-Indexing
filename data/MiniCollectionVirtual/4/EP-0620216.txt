<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new benzamide derivatives
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.More particularly, it relates to new benzamide
derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof
which possess activities as vasopressin antagonistic
activity, vasodilating activity, hypotensive activity,
activity for inhibiting saccharide release in liver,
activity for inhibiting growth of mesagium cells, water
diuretic activity, platelet agglutination inhibitory
activity, oxytocin antagonistic activity and the like, to
a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same
for the treatment and/or prevention of
hypertension, heart failure, renal insufficiency, edema,
ascites, vasopressin parasecretion syndrome,
hepatocirrhosis, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, diabetic,
circulation disorder, oxytocin relating diseases [e.g.
premature delivery, dysmenorrhea, endometritis, etc.] and 
the like in human beings or animals.One object of this invention is to provide new and
useful benzamide derivatives which possess aforesaid
activities.Another object of this invention is to provide
processes for the preparation of said benzamide
derivatives and salts thereof.A further object of this invention is to provide a
pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active
ingredient, said benzamide derivatives and
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.Still further object of this invention is to provide
a use of the compounds of the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment and/or prevention
of aforesaid diseases in human beings or animals, using
said benzamide derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable
salts thereof.Some benzamide derivatives have been known as
vasopressin antagonist or oxytocin antagonist, for
example, in International Publication Nos. WO 91/05549 and
WO 94/01113, and Japanese Patent Application Publication
Nos. 5-132466 and 5-320135.The object benzamide derivatives of this invention
are new and can be represented by the following general
formula (I) :
