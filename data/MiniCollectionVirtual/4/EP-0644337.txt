<ABSTRACT>
Method for the sealed joining-together of sandwich panels required to be exposed to surface fluid and including a core (1) made of rigid plastic foam located between two rigid facings (2,3), characterised in that there is located, in longitudinal slots (4) made in the assembly sides of the said panels (A1, A2), for example consisting of cuts made in the core (1) of these panels, edge cladding sections (7) including a longitudinal groove (8), the bottom of which exhibits at least one drainage channel (9) including a longitudinal opening (17) emerging in the said groove (8), the panels (A1, A2) thus equipped being joined together by means of a joining section (18) in the shape of a gutter section which is fed into the longitudinal grooves (8) of the edge cladding sections (7) via its longitudinal sides and which is arranged so that its longitudinal lateral faces (24) end respectively at the entry to the longitudinal opening (17) of the drainage channels (9).
