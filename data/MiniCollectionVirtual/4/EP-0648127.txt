<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for culturing clinical Staphylococcus epidermidis cells that reproducibly enables identification of a limited number of predominant serotypes. Two predominant serotypes common to most clinical cases of S. epidermidis have been identified and are denoted Type I and Type II. A particular polysaccharide surface antigen is associated with each of the Type I and Type II serotypes. The surface antigens can be used to provide active and passive immunization against S. epidermidis infection and to produce a hyperimmune immunoglobulin or antibodies for treatment of S. epidermidis infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to particular serotypes of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and
to a vaccine produced using these surface antigens associated with these serotypes.
Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus infections are a leading cause of bacteremia in
hospitalized patients. In particular, S. epidermidis, formally thought not to be a pathogen,
has been discovered to be a significant factor in this bacteremia. Morbidity and mortality
from S. epidermidis infection is especially high among patients requiring prosthetic
medical devices. This is thought to be a result of slime produced by S. epidermidis which
permits adherence to and colonization of these medical examples, e.g., catheters and
heart valves.Because the slime is thought to be the factor responsible for infection by S. epidermidis,
attention has focused on those aspects of the surface which mediate attachment to
foreign bodies. An extracellular slime has been identified by various researchers, and
culture conditions promoting production of this slime have been used.In addition to a focus on the slime produced by S. epidermidis, research to date has
largely been directed toward a limited number of specific strains of the bacteria which
have been isolated. Ichiman et al. studied three strains of S. epidermidis, which they
cultured in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. Immunization of mice with cell surface
polysaccharides from these cultured microorganisms were not effective, 
however, in providing protection to heterologous strains. Characterization of the surface
polysaccharides which were isolated showed serological heterogeneity. Ichiman et al., J.
Appl. Bact.51: 229-241 (1981). Type I, II and III cell surface antigens of S. epidermidis
strains ATCC31432, SE-360 and SE-10 are described in the prior art (Ichiman et al, J.
Appl. Bact.63:1987, 165-169; Ichiman et al, Can. J. Microbiol. 37/5, 05/1991, 404-407,
Ichiman et al, J. Appl. Bact.71: 1991, 176-181, and in US-A-4197 290) as well as an
adhesin isolated from S. epidermidis strain RP-62A (US-A-5 055 455).According to Ichiman, in order to be an effective vaccine for clinical use, each infective
strain would have to isolated and a vaccine developed against each strain. This would be
untenable from a practical standpoint.It is an object of the invention to provide an effective vaccine for clinical use against S.
epidermidis infection.It is yet another object of the invention to provide a vaccine which is effective against most
clinically pathogenic strains of S. epidermidis.It is a further
