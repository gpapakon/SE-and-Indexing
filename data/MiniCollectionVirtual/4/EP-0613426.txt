<ABSTRACT>
A system for preventing a vehicle from running away downhill and for ensuring a smooth take-up from rest, in which signals proportional to engine speed (Ve) and vehicle speed (Vdp) are used. The engine speed signal is compared with a reference signal (Vs) to produce an engagement signal (E) which controls a clutch actuation means for engagement of the clutch. The vehicle speed signal (Vdp) and the engine speed signal (Ve) are fed into a filter (71) which produces a clutch actuation signal if either (Vdp or E) exceeds a predetermined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clutch control 
system for a vehicle. Our patent GB 2 088 007 describes a clutch 
control system in which the clutch is progressively 
engaged as the torque demand issued by the driver 
increases to temporarily limit the engine speed to 
a set value. 
Our patent US-A-4561530 describes a clutch 
control system in which a gain control is provided 
to adjust the gain applied to a clutch position 
signal before its comparison with a clutch command 
signal. 
Both these systems provide a smooth take up from 
rest but suffer from the disadvantage that if the 
vehicle while in gear should roll down a hill gathering 
speed while the engine is still idle, the 
clutch will not engage to provide a degree of braking, 
nor can the driver make it engage without 
speeding up the engine using the speed control 
means, an action that would appear to him totally 
unnatural in a circumstance when he wanted to cause 
the vehicle to be restrained. Furthermore, if the 
engine cannot be started due to failure or partial  
 
failure of the self-starting system, the engine 
cannot be started by any of the commonly accepted 
emergency starting means such as push starting or 
tow-starting. It is an object of the present invention to 
overcome these disadvantages. The present invention provides a clutch control 
system for a vehicle having a clutch, a gearbox and 
an engine, the system comprising a vehicle speed 
sensor for generating a vehicle speed signal 
variable with the speed of the vehicle, and a 
clutch engagement signal generator that produces a 
signal utilised for controlling a clutch actuation 
means that operates the clutch engagement, the 
system being characterised by the inclusion of a 
filter means that receives the engagement signal 
and the engine speed to generate a clutch actuation 
means for engagement of the clutch in the event 
that either the vehicle speed signal and/or the 
engagement signal exceeds a predetermined minimum 
value. Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be 
described by way of example only with reference to 
the accompanying drawings in which:-  
 
Fig 1 is a schematic of a control system according 
to a first embodiment of the present invention. Fig 2 is an analogue circuit diagram of the control 
system of Fig 1; Fig 3 is a block diagram showing the steps used in 
a microprocessor in a second embodiment of the invention. Fig 4 is a graph of the clutch position Vs engine 
speed illustrating operation of the clutch stall 
limiter. Referring to Fig

<CLAIMS>
A friction clutch control system for a vehicle 
having a clutch (14), a multi-ratio gearbox 

(12) and an engine (10), the system comprising 
a vehicle speed sensor (42) for generating a 

vehicle speed signal (Vdp) variable with the 
speed of the vehicle, and a clutch engagement 

signal generator (46,50,52) that produces an 
engagement signal (E) utilised for controlling 

a clutch actuation means (69) that operates 
the clutch engagement, the system being 

characterised by the inclusion of a filter 
means (71) that receives the engagement 

signal (E) and the vehicle speed signal (Vdp) 
to generate a clutch actuation signal (A) for 

operation of the clutch actuation means (69) 
for engagement of the clutch in the event 

that either the vehicle speed signal (Vdp) 
and/or the engagement signal (E) exceeds a 

predetermined minimum value. 
A system according to Claim 1, wherein the 
clutch actuation signal (A) is passed into a 

limiter (72) which also receives a vehicle engine 
speed signal (Ve), the limiter being  

 
enabled by the engine speed exceeding a 

predetermined value, so that the engagement of 
the clutch (14) is proportional to the engine 

speed up to a second predetermined value of 
engine speed where the clutch can be fully engaged. 
A system according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 which 
further includes a gear position sensor (32) used 

for controlling the clutch actuation means (69), 
so that when the engine (10) is not running, the 

clutch (14) is only engageable when the vehicle 
speed signal (Vdp) exceeds a minimum value, the 

vehicle is in neutral, and then the vehicle is 
subsequently put in gear. 
A system as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 
3 wherein when the engine (10) is running and the 

vehicle speed (Vdp) exceeds said predetermined 
value, the clutch (14) is ramped to a level of engagement 

in order to control the engine speed to 
a predetermined level. 
A system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 
wherein when the engine (10) is not running, and 

the vehicle speed (Vdp) drops below a further predetermined 
value the clutch (14) is caused to disengage.  

 
A system according to any foregoing claim 
wherein the vehicle speed sensor (42) includes 

means for measuring the speed of rotation (Vdp) of 
a driven plate of the clutch (14). 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
wherein the vehicle speed sensor (42) includes 

means for measuring the speed of rotation of an 
output from the gearbox (12). 
A system according to claim 6 or 7 wherein the vehicle 
speed sensor further includes means for 

varying the measured speed of rotation of the 
driven plate or gearbox output according to the 

ratio engaged in the gearbox. 
A clutch control system according to claim 2 
wherein the filter means, limiter and other 

control functions are carried out by a microprocessor.
