<ABSTRACT>
A device for the prevention of the abuse of a dry-plate clutch (1) for a motor vehicle with a manual gearbox, wherein the device acts jointly with a hydraulic master cylinder (3) and a related slave cylinder (4) in the operation of the clutch (1). According to the invention the device comprises a valve unit (20) which is installed hydraulically in series with and between the master cylinder (3) and the slave cylinder (4). The valve unit opens when the valve body (32) is moved towards the slave cylinder (4). A first passage (53) which extends in the valve body (32) or in the valve housing (21) permits restricted fluid flow through the valve (20) when the valve unit (20) is closed. A device (33, 35, 41) keeps the valve unit (20) open when the clutch is located in positions between a position of maximum disengagement and a second position located close to the position in which the clutch begins to engage. During an engagement of the clutch which is so rapid that there is a risk of damage to the transmission, the force of a spring (40) which attempts to open the valve unit (20) becomes less than the force exercised by the hydraulic fluid on the valve body (32) and attempts to close the valve unit (20), thus causing it to be moved towards its seat (31), whereupon the fluid is forced to flow through the passage (53).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device for the prevention of the 
abuse of a dry-plate clutch for a motor vehicle with a 
manual gearbox, wherein the device acts jointly with a 
hydraulic master cylinder and a related slave cylinder in 
the operation of the clutch. The use of a device of the above-mentioned type prevents 
the transfer of an excessive torque gradient (torque change 
per time unit) to the transmission due to a too rapid 
release of the clutch pedal during the engagement of the 
clutch. Such abuse of the clutch is especially risky when 
starting in first gear or in reverse gear, as well as when 
moving through the lowest gears when driving forwards. The 
sudden forces acting on the transmission during such a 
rapid engaging of the clutch often result in damage to the 
differential gears, the crown wheel and the pinion of the 
rear axle transmission unit, the drive shaft and the 
gearbox, but damage has also been found in engines due to 
frequent abuse of the clutch. There are previously known 
devices for counteracting the abuse of the clutch, where 
the devices are not included in the hydraulic clutch 
system, but comprise levers and rods which are connected 
to the clutch pedal or the clutch master cylinder's piston 
rod or the clutch disengagement arm, and are effective 
during the course of clutch engagement in the same way as a 
shock absorber. These mechanical systems must be manufactured 
with fine tolerances, are difficult to instal, 
expensive and dampen the clutch movement every time it is 
engaged, even when the clutch pedal is released in the 
correct manner. Another known system for counteracting the abuse of the 
clutch works hydraulically via a choke device with a non-return 
valve installed in a bypass pipe. When the clutch is 
engaged the non-return valve closes, thus causing all the  
 
hydraulic fluid to flow via the choke device, thereby 
providing a damping during the entire return movement of 
the clutch pedal. In this case too a damping takes place 
each time the clutch is engaged, irrespective of whether 
the clutch pedal is moved rapidly or slowly. Since the 
damping takes place during the entire return movement, a 
rapid gear change is virtually impossible, a fact which is 
particularly critical and awkward when changing gear at low 
temperatures since the damping increases and the clutch 
can slip. For this reason, in another embodiment of this system an 
electromagnetically controlled valve is incorporated which 
engages the device only when the clutch is used in 
conne

A device for the prevention of the abuse, i.e. too 
rapid engagement, of a dry-plate clutch (1) for a motor 

vehicle with a manual gearbox, wherein the device acts 
jointly with a hydraulic master cylinder (3) and a related 

slave cylinder (4) for operation of the clutch (1), and the 
device comprises a valve unit (20) which is installed 

hydraulically in series with and between the master 
cylinder (3) and the slave cylinder (4), and which has 


a valve body (32) and a valve housing (21), which 
comprises a valve seat (31) and a first and a second valve 

housing chamber (51 and 52), which are located on each side 
of the valve seat (31) and are arranged to face the slave 

cylinder (4) and the master cylinder (3) respectively, the 
valve unit (20) opening when there is movement of the valve 

body (32) into the first valve housing chamber (51),
characterized in that
 the device comprises: 
a first passage (53) which directly connects the chambers 
(51, 52) with each other and which permits restricted fluid 

flow between the chambers (51, 52) when the valve unit (20) 
is closed, 
a device (33, 35, 41) for forcible opening of the valve 
unit (20) when the clutch is located in positions between a 

position of maximum disengagement and a second position 
located close to the position in which the clutch begins to 

engage, and 
a spring (40) which is arranged to exercise a force on 
the valve body (32) in order to attempt to move it away 

from its seat (31), 
 
wherein the force exercised by the spring (40) is greater 

than the force exercised on the valve body (20) of the 
hydraulic fluid when it flows towards the master cylinder 

(3) in order to engage the clutch (1) during careful, 
correct use of the clutch (1), but wherein this spring 

power is less than the power exercised by the hydraulic  
 

fluid when the clutch (1) is abused by being engaged more 
rapidly than a predetermined rate. 
A device according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 the valve body (32) has a piston 
section (54) which is located on that side of the valve 

body (32) which is arranged to face the slave cylinder (4), 
wherein the piston section (54) is arranged to slide in a 

cylinder section of the first valve housing chamber (51) 
and comprises a second passage (55) which extends between 

those piston sides which are arranged to face the slave 
cylinder (4) and the master cylinder (3) respectively. 
A device according to claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 the device for forcible opening of 
the valve unit (20) comprises a valve rod (33) which is 

arranged to connect the valve body (32) with the piston (5, 
9) of one of the hydraulic cylinders (3, 4). 
A device according to claim 3,
characterized in that
 the diameter of the valve body's (32) 
pistos section (54) is equal to or slightly smaller than 

the diameter of the piston (5 or 9) to which the valve body 
(32) is connected. 
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 the characteristics of the spring 
(40) which attempts to open the valve unit are adapted to 

the characteristics of the spring device which is included 

in the clutch (1) and which attempts to engage it in such a 
manner that the valve body (32) is moved away from its seat 

by the spring (40) after the clutch (1) has been engaged.
