<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color video camera,
and more particularly to a color video camera capable of
improving gradation of a dark signal level.As well known, a color video camera has a function of
auto-signal level control by using iris servo mechanism.
The iris servo mechanism controls an incident light to a
pick-up device in the camera. Fig. 1 shows a schematic
block diagram of a conventional color video camera. In
this figure, light focused by an iris-equipped lens 1 is
converted into red, green and blue component signals
(R, G and B signals) by pick-up devices 2R, 2G and 2B.
The R, G and B signals undergo signal processing by
processing circuits 3R, 3G and 3B, each including a gamma
correction part. After this, the processed R, G and B
signals are converted into a composite video signal by
combination of a matrix encoder 4 which delivers a
luminance signal Y and chrominance signals I and Q, a
chroma encoder 5 and an adder 6, for example. On the
other hand, the processed R, G and 3 signals from the
processing circuits 3R, 3G and 3B are supplied to an iris
control circuit 7. This circuit 7 detects a video signal
level and controls the iris in accordance with the detected 
video signal level so as to maintain the video signal
level at a predetermined level. For signal level detection,
the iris control circuit 7 adds peak values or average
values of the R, G and B signals in a predetermined manner.
Instead, it is possible to utilize a luminance signal Y
delivered from the matrix encoder 4 to detect the video
signal level. Therefore, when a luminance level of a
picked-up image becomes higher, the iris becomes closed.According to the conventional art, it is undesirably
inherent that gradation in a dark region is compressed and
deteriorated when a high luminance image is picked up, or
direct strong light is incident in the case of a rear light
situation, for example.Particularly, even when a dark area proportion is
relatively large in the whole image area, gradation of a
dark region is compressed and thus, it is troublesome to
observe image of the dark region in natural if the direct
strong light having a small proportion is incident.
To improve such gradation deterioration in a dark region,
there is proposed a technique, as disclosed in
JP-A-2-56180 (1990) (the corresponding
US-A-4,969,045), in which a gamma correcting value (γ)
is controlled in response to contrast of a picked-up image.However, according to the above-mentioned prior art
controlling a gamma correcting value, there is
