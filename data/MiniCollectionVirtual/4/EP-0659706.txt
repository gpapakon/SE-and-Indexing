<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a microwave
dielectric ceramic composition and, more in particular, it
relates to a microwave dielectric ceramic composition having
a temperature coefficient of a resonance frequency
(hereinafter simply referred to as τ f) varied generally
within a practical characteristic range while maintaining a
practical unload Q (hereinafter simply referred to Qu) and a
greatly improved specific dielectric constant (hereinafter
simply referred to as ε r).The present invention also concerns a microwave
dielectric ceramic composition in which each of the
characteristics is balanced at a practical level.The present invention further concerns a microwave
dielectric ceramic composition in which ε r and Qu are
controlled generally within a practical characteristic
range while maintaining τ f at a practical high level and
each of the characteristics is balanced at a high level.The present invention further concerns a microwave
dielectric ceramic composition in which ε r, Qu and τ f
are controlled generally within a practical characteristic
range and each of the characteristics is maintained in a 
well balanced state.The present invention is utilized for impedance
matching or the like of dielectric resonators, microwave
integrated circuit substrate, various kinds of microwave
circuits in a microwave region and it is particularly
suitable to LC filter materials.Generally, LC filter materials, dielectric
resonators, dielectric substrates used in the high
frequency region such as microwaves or millimetre wavelengths are
required to have high ε r and high Qu, as well as small
absolute value for the temperature coefficient of the
resonance frequency.Namely, since the dielectric loss of a microwave
dielectric ceramic composition (hereinafter simply referred
to as dielectric ceramic composition) tends to increase as
the working frequency becomes higher, a dielectric ceramic
composition having large ε r and Qu in a microwave region
is desired.For such a dielectric ceramic composition, a
composition belonging to a composite perovskite structure
such as Ba(Zn1/3Ta2/3)O3 or Ba(Mg1/3Ta2/3)O3 or BaO-TiO2
system composition has been used in recent years, but all of
them require a high sintering temperature of 1300 °C or
higher.Such a high sintering temperature requires greater
electric power consumption during sintering which results 
in a disadvantage regarding
production cost or productivity.Further, in a case of sintering together with a
conductor having a low melting point as an electrode, for
example,
