<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a zinc oxide 
varistor as a characteristic element of an arrestor for 

protecting a transmission and distribution line and 
peripheral devices thereof from surge voltage created 

by lightning, and more particularly a highly reliable 
zinc oxide varistor excellent in the non-linearity with 

respect to voltage, the discharge withstand current 
rating properties, and the life characteristics under 

voltage, a method of preparing the same, and PbO type 
crystallized glass for coating oxide ceramics employed 

for a zinc oxide varistor, etc. A zinc oxide varistor 
of the present invention comprises a sintered body (1) 

and a high resistive side layer (3) consisting of 
crystallized glass with high crystallinity containing 

the prescribed amount of SiO₂, MoO₃, WO₃, TiO₂, NiO, 
etc., formed on the sides of the sintered body (1) to 

enhance the strength and the insulating property thereof, 
thereby improving the non-linearity with respect to 

voltage, the discharge withstand current rating properties 
and the life characteristics under voltage. The 

crystallized glass composition for coating of the 
present invention comprises PbO as a main component and 

additives such as ZnO, B₂O₃, SiO₂, MoO₃, WO₃, TiO₂, and 
NiO to enhance the crystallinity and the insulating 

property thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention particularly relates to 
a zinc oxide varistor used in the field of an electric 
power system, a method of preparing the same, and a 
crystallized glass composition used for coating an 
oxide ceramic employed for a thermistor or a varistor. A zinc oxide varistor comprising ZnO as a 
main component and several kinds of metallic oxides 
including Bi2O3, CoO, Sb2O3, Cr2O3, and MnO2 as other 
components has a high resistance to surge voltage and 
excellent non-linearity with respect to voltage. 
Therefore, it has been generally known that the zinc 
oxide varistor is widely used as an element for a 
gapless arrestor in place of conventional silicon 
carbide varistors in recent years. For example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 
No. 62-101002, etc., disclose conventional 
methods of preparing a zinc oxide varistor. The aforesaid 
prior art reference discloses as follows: first, 
to ZnO as a main component are added metallic oxides 
such as Bi2O3, Sb2O3, Cr2O3, CoO, and MnO2 each in an 
amount of 0.01 to 6.0 mol% to prepare a mixed powder.  
 
Then, the mixed powder thus obtained is blended and 
granulated. The resulting granules are molded by 
application of pressure in a cylindrical form, after 
which the molded body is baked in an electric furnace 
at 1200°C for 6 hours. Next, to the sides of the 
sintered body thus obtained are applied glass paste 
consisting of 80 percent by weight of PbO type frit 
glass containing 60 percent by weight of PbO, 20 percent 
by weight of feldspar, and an organic binder by 
means of a screen printing machine in a ratio of 5 to 
500 mg/cm2, followed by baking treatment. Next, both 
end faces of the element thus obtained are subjected to 
surface polishing and then an aluminum metallikon 
electrode is formed thereon, thereby obtaining a zinc 
oxide varistor. However, since a zinc oxide varistor prepared 
by the aforesaid conventional method employed screen 
printing, a high resistive side layer was formed with a 
uniform thickness. This led to an advantage in that 
discharge withstand current rating properties did not 
largely vary among varistors thus prepared, whereas 
since the high resistive side layer was made of composite 
glass consisting of PbO type frit glass and feldspar, 
the varistor also had disadvantages as follows: 
the discharge withstand current rating properties were 
poor, and the non-linearity with respect to voltage 
lowered during baking treatment of glass, thereby 
degrading the life characteristics under voltage. From EP-A-0
