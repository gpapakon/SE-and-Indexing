<ABSTRACT>
Pavement element such as a tile with an upper porous layer 
(2), below that a liquid-tight layer (3) and possibly there 

below a heavy layer (4). In order to keep a floor laid with 
suchlike elements well liquid-tight at the level of the 

liquid-tight layers sealing means (6) are provided between 
this layer (3) or one element and the same layer (3') of an 

adjacent element. Preferably these means consist in a rib 
or protrusion, which may cover the complete height of the 

liquid-tight layer. Preferably the porous layer is formed 
from particles of the same size having an irregular shape 

and the liquid-tight layer from particle from different 
particle sizes, such that the particles attain a high 

filling degree.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the problem to apply a ground
covering layer or pavement, which with a high degree of
security prevents that spilled polluted liquids, such as
petroleum products, chemical substances, poisonous
materials etc. reach the soil below it, and allows for a
high discharge of liquid, for instance rainwater.In the Dutch patent application NL-A-7213263 a self
draining layer has been described as well as a method for
making it. This layer consists in an upper layer of porous
material and a lower layer below it, which is impervious to
liquids. Draining tubes may be arranged between both layers
to remove liquid which remains on the lower layer. The
issue is, that undesired substances, such as spilled fuel
oil, easy inflammable liquids, poisonous liquids, biting
liquids and/or harmful liquids are retained without
penetrating into the ground. Another important property is
the possibility to keep water away from surfaces on which
vehicles or airplanes run and to prevent aqua-planning. A
difficulty of such a ground cover is, that the several
layers have to be densified, which often is impossible.
Also with dumping of materials and binding agent it is not
always possible to obtain sufficient coverage of the
material particles with the binding agent when
manufacturing the layer in situ.Hindrances making the manufacturing and densifying of
complete layers difficult or hardly possible are for
instances car fuel pumps in the immediate surroundings, the
application of the prescribed catching means below tanks
for polluting liquids and the application of such an
impervious layer in buildings, especially on a higher
floor.The invention aims to eliminate these disadvantages. Moreover it aims at making a liquid permeable as well as a
liquid-tight layer with less binding agent.A ground covering element such as a brick or tile, provided
with an upper surface, there below at least two layers and
a bottom surface is per se known from among others the
Dutch patent applications NL-A-8402658 and NL-A-8200289,
whereas also the European patent application EP-A-0.053.092
show such a ground covering element. None of these ground
covering elements provides, however, a possibility to solve
the problems stated in the above.Dutch patent application NL-A-8200289 describes a tile with
a lower layer which has almost the composition of an normal
concrete tile, whereas the upper layer contains a granulate
mineral material allowing for colour adaption.Dutch patent application NL-A-8402658 shows a ground cover
element in the
