<ABSTRACT>
Both the fiber and the bulk Fabry-Perot etalons can be made temperature 
insensitive by the addition of a compensator element. This element adjusts the optical 

length of the air-gap in the etalon cavity so as to compensate for any changes in the 
optical length of the fiber or the etalon slab due to ambient temperature changes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to passive arrangements for tuning Fabry-Perot etalons, 
and for making the resonant wavelengths of such devices insensitive to temperature 
changes. In wavelength-division multiplexed systems, there is a need for filters capable 
of separating the different wavelength channels. As these filters must often operate at 
different locations, there is a further need for wavelength standards in order to avoid 
channel collisions and to maintain system transparency. Specifically, such filters must 
be capable of maintaining their preset frequencies in environments in which the 
temperature may change. While Fabry-Perot etalons are convenient for this purpose in 
lightwave systems, they have the disadvantage that they tend to be temperature 
sensitive. One solution to this problem is to design filters that can be preset to a 
desired wavelength, and then place them in a temperature-controlled environment in 
order to avoid temperature-dependent effects. A preferred alternative approach would 
be to design an etalon that is passively compensated for temperature fluctuations solely 
by virtue of its physical configuration. Such a filter is then completely passive, and 
does not require heating elements and active controls to maintain its wavelength 
setting in an environment in which the temperature tends to vary. In U.S. Patent 4,861,136, an etalon is disclosed which comprises a waveguiding 
portion and a non-waveguiding (i.e., air gap) portion. It is an advantage of such an 
etalon that its frequency can be readily tuned simply by changing the length of the 
gap. However, as noted above, the optical length of the cavity also varies as a 
function of temperature, thereby detuning the filter. Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to provide passive 
temperature compensation in a Fabry-Perot etalon.  The optical length and, hence, the resonant wavelength of a Fabry-Perot etalon 
tends to change as a function of temperature. In accordance with the present invention, 
compensators are provided that serve to counter this change in optical wavelength. 
In an etalon comprising a length of fiber and an air gap, the compensators 
modify the length of the air gap in a sense to cancel any change in the length of the 
filter. In a typical embodiment, the compensators are lengths of rotary connector 
capillaries in which the optical fiber is embedded. The lengths of the capillaries are 
precisely maintained by means of a spacing sleeve. In a second embodiment of the invention, passive
