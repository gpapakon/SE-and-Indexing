<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a moisture-absorbing structure, in 
particular a pad, provided with at 

least one moisture-absorbing layer (1), 
which is provided on a layer which is 

impervious to liquid (2). The impervious 
layer (1,6) is thereby made of a halogenated 

interpolymer with a base of ethene. 
A single top layer consisting of cotton 

and having a terry cloth structure (2) 
may be provided on top of the impervious layer. According to another 

embodiment a moisture-absorbing intermediate 
layer (5) may be provided on top 

of said impervious layer, a layer of cottonwool (4) 
may be provided on top 

of said moisture-absorbing intermediate 
layer and an uppermost top layer (3) 

may be provided on top of said layer of cottonwool.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a moisture-absorbing structure, in 
particular a pad, provided with at least one moisture-absorbing layer, 
which is provided on a layer which is impervious to liquid, as known from DE-U-9112275. Such moisture-absorbing structures have been known for many years 
and are used in large quantities, for example as incontinence pads. A 
drawback of the existing structures is that generally they can be used 
only once, since they cannot be washed very well, whilst furthermore the 
impervious layer is made of a material which gives off harmful substances 
upon being incinerated. According to the invention the impervious layer is made of a 
halogenated interpolymer with a base of ethene and a single top layer consisting of cotton 
and having a terry cloth structure is provided on top of said impervious layer. In practice it has 
appeared to be very well possible to combine an impervious layer made of 
such a material with a moisture-absorbing layer, whereby a 
structure of this type lends itself particularly well for repeated use, 
since such a structure can also be washed at high temperatures, washing 
water of up to ± 90 °C, without any unequal shrinkage among the 
layers, which may lead to undesirable deformation of the structure. The 
percentage of shrinkage of the pad appears to be virtually nil thereby. 
In addition to that the impervious layer does not contain any substances 
which are harmful for the environment. It is noted that from US-A-4499131 it is known that e.g. neoprene allows for moisture resistibility 
in reasable moisture impervious underpads. The invention will be explained in more detail hereafter with 
reference to two possible embodiments of the moisture-absorbing 
structure according to the invention diagrammatically illustrated in the 
accompanying Figure. Figure 1 shows a structure according to the invention, consisting 
of two layers. The pad shown in Figure 1 is built up of an impervious layer, 
which is made of a halogenated interpolymer with a base of ethene, more 
in particular of alcryn (trademark of Dupont). A layer 2, which for easy reference is shown spaced from the 
impervious layer 1, is adhered to said layer 1, said layer 2 having a 
so-called terry cloth structure and consisting of a hundred per cent  
 
cotton. The layer 2 was pressed on the layer 1 whilst the material of layer 
1 was still slightly sticky, so as to make layer 2 adhere to layer 1 over 
the entire surface. The construction is thereby such that 46 per cent by weight of
