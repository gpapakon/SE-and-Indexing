<ABSTRACT>
A high-impact polystyrene resin composition comprising a syndiotactic styrene polymer (A) and a polar 
rubbery elastomer (B), and another high-impact polystyrene resin composition comprising a rubbery elastomer (C) 

and/or polyphenylene ether (D) in addition to the above composition. These compositions are excellent in thermal 
resistance, elastic modulus, impact resistance and elongation, thus being utilizable in molding various industrial 

materials such as electrical and electronics components, industrial structural materials, automative parts, household 
electric appliances and, machine parts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an impact resistant
polystyrene composition. More particularly, it pertains
to a syndiotactic polystyrene composition which is
excellent not only in heat resistance and modulus of
elasticity but also in impact resistance and
extensibility.A styrenic polymer having syndiotactic configuration
(hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as SPS) is excellent in
heat resistance and chemical resistance but is poor in
impact resistance and therefore, it has heretofore been
limited in the scope of application usable as a
construction material. In order to solve the problem,
improvement have been made on the impact resistance of
SPS, for example, by blending a rubbery elastomer and/or
other thermoplastic resin with SPS. (Refer to Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 257950/1987,
146944/1989, 182344/1989, 279944/1989 and 64140/1990.)For example, there are available SPS containing a
styrenic compound as a component and a rubbery
elastomer (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
No. 146944/1989), a SPS/rubber composition incorporated
with a block or graft copolymer containing atactic
polystyrene chain as a compatibilizer (refer to Japanese 
Patent Application Laid-Open No. 279944/1989), and a
SPS/rubber composition incorporated with a poly(phenylene
ether) (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No.
279944/1989) and the like.However, since there is used in the above-mentioned
improved technique, a rubbery component or a block or
graft copolymer containing atactic polystyrene chain as a
compatibilizer for the purpose of improving the
compatibility between SPS and the rubbery component that
are incompatible with each other and enhancing the
dispersibility and interfacial strength of the rubbery
component, the problem still remains unsolved in that the
working effect as the compatibilizer and the enhancement
of impact resistance have still been insufficient. On the
other hand, in the case of adding a large amount of a
poly(phenylene ether) for the purpose of enhancing the
impact resistance, the addition thereof inevitably brings
about the deterioration of the resultant composition with
respect to the hue and long-term heat resistance as well
as the decrease in the crystallinity of the SPS.In view of the above, intensive research and
investigation were continued by the present inventors in
order to solve the above-mentioned problems. As a result,
it has been found that such problems can be solved by
incorporating a rubbery elastomer having a polar group as
a rubber
