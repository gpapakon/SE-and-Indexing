alternation of at least 85%; a process for its preparation; a 

hydrocarbon oil composition containing it; and its use as a flow 
improver additive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to copolymers of n-alkyl (meth)acrylates
with maleic anhydride, a process for their preparation,
hydrocarbon oil compositions containing them and their use as flow
improver additives.Hydrocarbon oils such as gas oils, diesel oils, fuel oils,
lubricating oils and crude oils contain varying amounts of
paraffins. The proportion of long chain n-paraffins, in
particular, determines the cold-flow behaviour of the oils. On
cooling, the n-paraffins separate out as plate-like crystals which
interact together to form a three-dimensional network in which
still liquid oil becomes trapped, resulting in increased oil
viscosity and decreased oil flowability. In gas oil and diesel oil
applications, this phenomenon results in filter blockage, whereas
in crude oil applications, it results in the gellation of the crude
oil and the formation of deposits in pipelines and storage tanks
leading to considerable losses in production and capacity.It is well known that these problems can be alleviated by the
addition of so-called flow improvers to such oils. There are two
kinds of flow improver: nucleation modifiers and growth modifiers.
Nucleation modifiers promote the formation of many small paraffin
crystals whereas growth modifiers promote the formation of larger
crystal clusters. In both cases however, the plate-like crystals
described above are not formed. Nucleation modifiers find
application in gas oils and diesel oils since the paraffin crystals
formed are sufficiently small enough to pass through a filter.
Growth modifiers, by contrast, are used in filter-free
applications, e.g. in crude oils. US-A-4,663,491 discloses the use as crystallisation inhibitors
in crude oil of copolymers of maleic anhydride and n-alkyl
acrylates of the general formula

in which:
R1 represents hydrogen or methyl andR2 represents an n-alkyl radical having at least 16, preferably
from 16 to 30, carbon atoms.The copolymers are prepared by a process which comprises first
mixing the total charge of n-alkyl acrylate with the total charge
of maleic anhydride (the molar ratio acrylate: anhydride being in
the range from 20:1 to 1:10, preferably from 8:1 to 1:5 and
especially from 4:1 to 1:1), and heating the mixture, in the
presence of an organosoluble radical-forming catalyst, at a
temperature in the range from 50 to 150°C, preferably from 80 to
120°C. It is clear from the examples of the patent that the most
preferred temperatures are in the range from 85 to 95°C. At such
temperatures, the reaction is complete in about 4
