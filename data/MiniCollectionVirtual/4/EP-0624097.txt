<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel immunoreagents
and more particularly to targeting radioactive
immunoreagents which find particular utility in
therapeutic and diagnostic imaging compositions and
methods. The present invention further relates to novel
complexing agents.Prior to 1980, the targeting of tumor-bearing sites
by radioimmunoglobulin had been demonstrated by a number
of laboratories at different institutions (S.E. Order et
al., "Use of Isotopic Immunoglobulin in Therapy", Cancer
Research 40, 3001-7 (August 1980)). By 1980 it was
demonstrated that tumors would concentrate radiolabeled-antibodies
to tumor associated antigens and that radio-labelled
reagents employed allowed both diagnostic
imaging of tumors, e.g., by gamma camera imaging
(radioimmunoscintigraphy) and positron tomography, and
therapeutic treatment, i.e., reduction in tumor size by
the targeting radioactive immunoreagent.An alternative to radiolabelling is fluorescent
labelling. HSC Research Development Corporation (EP-A-171978)
describe a number of dicarboxylic acid
phenanthroline derivatives and their use in fluorescent
immunoassays. The chelates are formed with lanthamide
salts which are highly fluorescent in aqueous solution
avoiding the hazards involved with radionuclides.Eastman Kodak Company (EP-A-288256) describe
fluorescent labels comprising a Europium (III) ion and a
chelating agent. The chelates are designed to improve
quantum efficiency and thus fluorescent equilibrium. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. (EP-A-178450) describes a
number of phenanthroline ruthenium complexes and methods
for their synthesis. These complexes are also suggested
for use in fluorescent immunoassays.Early targeting with radiolabeled immunoreagents
was carried out with radioactive-iodine. However, as
noted by Scheinberg et al., "Tumor Imaging with
Radioactive Metal Chelates Conjugated to Monoclonal
Antibodies", Science 215, No. 19, 1511-13 (March 1982),
iodine isotopes pose several problems, particularly with
respect to scanning of tumor images. 
Of the three commonly available isotopic forms, only
123I has the appropriate emission characteristics for
imaging and a short enough half-life to be safely used
diagnostically. The gamma radiation of 125I is too
weak for imaging. 131I has often been used but is
undesirable because of its long half-life and high
energy gamma and cytotoxic beta radiations. 131I has
also been used therapeutically for large tumors, but
appears ineffective in the treatment of small tumors.
