<ABSTRACT>
Agricultural formulations of fluroxypyr that contain an ester of fluroxypyr that is liquid at ambient temperatures, such as the 1-butoxy-2-propyl ester or the 2-ethylhexyl ester, and that contain a reduced amount of organic solvent or no organic solvent are disclosed. The formulations have good physical properties and are highly effective herbicides.

<DESCRIPTION>
Agricultural chemicals, such as herbicides,
insecticides, and fungicides are typically combined with
carriers and adjuvants to obtain a formulated product before
sale to the ultimate user. The adjuvants and carriers employed
add to the cost and, in some cases, make the products
less desirable environmentally. On the other hand, these
ingredients often contribute positively to the efficacy
of the formulated product. The organic solvents,
especially hydrocarbon solvents, typically found in
formulated agricultural products are examples of carriers
that have these characteristics. The preparation of
formulated agricultural products that contain very little
or no organic solvent, and, especially, no petroleum
hydrocarbon or chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, but that
are at least as effective as formulated products that do,
is a desirable objective.Fluroxypyr, which is ((4-amino-3,5-dichloro-6-fluoro-2-pyridinyl)oxy)acetic
acid, is a commercially available
herbicide that is presently sold as the 1-methylheptyl
ester in the form of an emulsifiable concentrate formulation
containing 180 grams of acid equivalent per liter
of formulation. Emulsifiable concentrate formulations
containing higher levels of this ester and common
solvents were found to be unsuitable due to solubility
limitations. U.S. Patent 4,108,629 proposes that
emulsifiable concentrate formulations containing from
about 2 to about 50 percent of fluroxypyr esters can be 
prepared, but only discloses such formulations containing
up to about 25 percent.Wettable powder and water dispersible granule
formulations containing fluroxypyr in the form of the 1-methyl-heptyl
ester have not been commercialized because they are
not as effective as liquid formulations. The efficacy of such
formulations can be improved by the addition of a low-volatile
organic solvent, but this is not desirable because, in addition
to the previously mentioned disadvantages of such solvents,
they reduce the amount of fluroxypyr ester that the product
can contain and still maintain acceptable physical
properties.It has now been found that both liquid and solid
agricultural formulations of fluroxypyr that contain a reduced
amount or no organic solvent but that have good physical
properties and are highly effective can be prepared if one
employs as the active ingredient an ester of fluroxypyr that
is liquid at ambient temperature. Such esters have
melting points below 25°C and are referred to herein as
liquid esters.The improved agricultural formulations of the
invention include

the liquid ester is selected from the 1-butoxy-2-propyl,

1-butoxy-2-butyl, 1-(1-methoxy-2-propoxy)-2-propyl,
1-(1-butoxy-2-propoxy)-2-propyl, 1-(1-(1-methoxy-2-propoxy)propoxy)-2-propyl,

1-(1-(1-butoxy-2-propoxy)propoxy)-2-propyl,
and 2-ethylhexyl ester.
A formulation according to Claim 2 wherein
the ester is the 1-butoxy-2-propyl ester, the 1-butoxy-2-butyl

ester, or the 2-ethylhexyl ester.
A formulation according to Claim 2 which
is an emulsifiable concentrate containing at least 40

percent by weight fluroxypyr ester.
A formulation according to Claim 4 which
is an emulsifiable concentrate containing at least 65

percent by weight fluroxypyr ester.
A formulation according to Claim 2 which

percent by weight fluroxypyr ester in the emulsified
phase. 
A formulation according to Claim 6 wherein
the emulsified phase contains at least 65 percent by

weight fluroxypyr ester.

the emulsified phase contains at least 90 percent by

weight fluroxypyr ester.
A formulation according to Claim 8 wherein
the emulsified phase contains no added solvents.
A formulation according to Claim 2 which
is a wettable powder or a water dispersible granule

containing no added solvents.
A formulation according Claim 2 which
contains one or more other compatible herbicides.
A formulation according to Claim 11
wherein the other compatible herbicide is metosulam or

bifenox.

undesirable vegetation with fluroxypyr which is

characterized by contacting the undesirable vegetation
with a spray solution prepared by diluting with water an

agricultural formulation as defined in any one of Claims
1 to 12.
