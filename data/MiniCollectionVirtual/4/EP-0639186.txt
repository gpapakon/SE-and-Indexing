<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of copending United States patent
application Serial No. 07/914,720, filed July 16, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part
of United States patent application Serial No. 07/870,509, filed April 17, 1992,
now abandoned.The present invention relates to plant-derived chemotherapeutic
compounds. More particularly, the invention is directed to 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin
III, a natural product isolated from Taxus canadensis, as well as
novel analogs of taxol prepared therefrom.Taxol, a member of the taxane family of terpenes, is of interest as a
chemotherapeutic agent against a broad range of cancers. Taxol has been shown
to be effective against advanced breast and ovarian cancers in clinical trials, and
has exhibited promising activity against a number of other tumor types in
preliminary investigations. A summary of the current state of taxol research,
development and clinical testing may be found in Borman, Chemical & Engineering
News (September 2, 1991), 11-18; a review of synthetic efforts in the taxol field is
provided by D.G.I. Kingston in Pharmacol. Therap. (1992), in press.Taxol, which possesses the structural formula

is currently limited in supply, as it is obtained by extraction primarily from the bark
and, to a lesser amount, the leaves of trees and bushes of the genus Taxus. The
primary source of taxol, the Pacific yew Taxus brevifolia, is a slow-growing
evergreen with limited geographic distribution and increasing scarcity.
Furthermore, the isolation of taxol, which constitutes less than 400 parts per million 
of the tree bark, is a difficult, low-yield and expensive process. Neither long-term
nor large-scale harvesting of yews is considered an acceptable option for
ecological as well as commercial reasons. There is, consequently, a pressing
need for additional supplies of taxol for clinical use and testing.Needles of other Taxus species are being explored as renewable sources
of taxol and its precursors. In Yaoxue Xuebao (Acta Pharm. Sinica) 1992,
27(4), 268-272 (1992), additional isolates from the Chinese yew species Taxus
chinesis are disclosed.Taxol prodrugs or derivatives having greater water solubility than the
naturally-occurring taxols have also been sought. In the search for new derivatives
with potentially enhanced solubility, one of the sites on the molecule where
attention has been directed is the ketone function at the C-9 position. Taxol is very
resistant to reduction, and the C-9 carbonyl group is specifically resistant to
reduction, even
