<ABSTRACT>
A lens blocking system in which a button is bonded to a lens 
surface. The button includes a capsule (2) of flowable 

substance with a flexible portion (3) that is brought into 
contact with and bonded to the lens surface. The flowable 

substance allows the flexible portion to conform to the 
shape of the lens surface, subsequent to which flow is then 

inhibited. The flowable substance may be a substance that 
is molten and then subsequently cooled to solidifying 

temperature after the button has been bonded to the lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to provision of a 
button, in particular but not exclusively applicable to 
the blocking of lenses on to the button via which the lens is 
held for subsequent processing operations. Approximately 40% of the people requiring spectacles need 
custom made lenses, by which is meant a lens of a 
configuration sufficiently individual that a finished lens 
is unlikely to be held as standard stock. One of the main 
reasons for requiring non standard lenses is astigmatism 
which necessitates a toric lens. For the preparation of non-standard lenses it is usual for 
the lens processing laboratory to hold stock of mass 
produced semi-finished lenses, i.e. lenses having one 
surface ground and polished (i.e. finished) but with the 
other surface available for individual working. Usually 
the finished surface is the one that will be the outward 
facing convex lens surface in the finished spectacles 
for better cosmetic appearance. In order to hold the semi-finished lens for the generation 
(when the lens is cut or ground) smoothing and polishing 
stages required to manufacture the custom finished lens it 
is necessary to mount the lens on a button assembly (button 
and mounting substance), this process being known as 
blocking. The machine employed in this process is called a 
blocker (examples being Autoflow 300 Series: Coburn 900: 
LOH 2000). It is usual for the finished surface (normally 
convex/front) of the lens to be protected by adhesive tape 
or lacquer. A hard metal button is put into the blocker, 
the lens is then put in a prescribed position in line with 
the metal button and a space between the button and the 
protected lens surface is filled with a substance such as 
low melting point alloy which on solidification forms a bond  
 
between the hard metal button and the protected lens 
surface. The front surface of the semi-finished lenses have a variety 
of shapes and curves and to get a sufficiently mechanically 
strong bond between the lens surface and the button it is 
necessary to use a bonding material that will conform to the 
surface of the lens. Further, modern plastic lenses are 
heat sensitive which restricts the choice of bonding 
materials to those that do not need to be applied at a high 
temperature. The most commonly used technique for bonding 
during the blocking process, as previously mentioned, is to 
use a low melting point alloy which is flowed into a hollow 
space between the button and lens. The alloy then rapidly 
solidifies to form a bonding interface between

A button for lens blocking, the button comprising a 
rigid portion (1), a flexible membrane (3) attached to the 

rigid portion (1) and a deformable substance retained by the 
flexible membrane (3) such that when the flexible membrane (3) is 

brought into contact with a lens surface (4) it conforms to 
irregularities in the lens surface (4), characterised in that 

the deformable substance comprises a flow inducible 
substance that is temporarily deformable through substance 

flow to conform to different lens curvatures and is 
subsequently settable to provide rigid support to the 

conformed membrane (3) and all that part of the lens surface (4) in 

contact therewith. 
A button according to claim 1, further characterised in 
that the flexible membrane (3) comprises a front portion and 

a flexible side wall portion extending rearwardly in the 
direction away from the lens surface (4). 
A button according to claim 2, further characterised in 
that a rigid supporting member is located around the inner 

periphery of the side wall portion to inhibit inward 
movement of the side wall portion as the front portion of 

the membrane (3) is depressed by a lens surface (4). 
A button according to any preceding claim in which the 
flow inducible substance comprises a material that is molten 

above ambient temperature. 
A button according to any preceding claim in which a 
bonding substance (5) is interposed between the flexible 

membrane (3) and the lens surface (4) and the flexible 
membrane (3) contacts the lens surface (4) via the bonding 

substance.  
 
A button according to any preceding claim in which the 
flexible membrane (3) comprises a portion not for contact with 

the lens surface (4) which accommodates flowing movement as the 
membrane (3) conforms to the lens curvature. 
A button according to any preceding claim in which the 
flexible membrane (3) comprises a separate flexible capsule (2) 

that releasably engages with the rigid portion (1) of the button. 
A button according to any preceding claim in which the 
flexible membrane (3) comprise regions of greater and lesser 

thickness and/or rigid or recessed formations (9). 
A button according to any preceding claim 
in which the flowable substance comprises low melting point 

alloy. 
A method of blocking a lens in which a button is 
bonded to a lens surface (4) with a low melting point 

substance that is isolated from both ambient atmosphere and 
the lens surface (4) within a capsule (2), the capsule (2) having a 

flexible membrane (3) for bringing into engagement with the 
lens surface (4) and conforming thereto when the substance is 

melted, and setting to provide rigid support to the 
conformed flexible membrane (3) and all that part of the lens surface 

(4) in contact therewith, the substance being retained 
entirely within the capsule (2) prior to, during and upon 

removal from engagement with the lens and the capsule (2) being 
reusable for attachment to another lens by remelting the 

substance in situ within the capsule (2). 
A method according to claim 10 in which the flow 
inducible substance comprises a low melting point alloy that 

becomes molten above ambient temperature but solidifies at 
ambient temperature and the alloy is heated to above ambient 

temperature to enable the flexible membrane (3) of the 
capsule (2) to conform to the lens surface (4).  

 
A method according to claim 10 or claim 11 in which a

membrane (3) and the lens surface (4) and the flexible membrane (3) 
contacts the lens surface (4) via the bonding substance (5). 
A method according to any of claims 10 to 12 in which 
the capsule (2) comprises a further flexible or elastic portion 

which accommodates flowing movement as the flexible membrane (3) 
conforms to the surface. 
A method according to any of claims 10 to 13 in which 
the capsule (2) comprises a separate flexible body that 

engages with a rigid portion (1) of the button.
