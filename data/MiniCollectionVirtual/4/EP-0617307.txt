<ABSTRACT>
An optical scanning apparatus includes an 
optical scanning mirror (10), a reflecting mirror (20), and a lens 

system (31,32). The optical scanning mirror (10) has a first 
reflecting surface (A) for reflecting an incident beam and a 

second reflecting surface (B) for reflecting the incident 
beam and causing the incident beam to emerge. The 

optical scanning mirror synchronously changes angles of 
the first and second reflecting surfaces (A,B) in a 

predetermined direction. The reflecting mirror (20) is 
arranged in an optical path between the first and second 

reflecting surfaces to form a double-reflection path. 
The lens system is arranged in the double-reflection 

path to cause a beam reflected by the first reflecting 
surface to be incident on the second reflecting surface 

at a predetermined angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
scanning apparatus using an optical scanning mirror and, 
more particularly, to an optical scanning apparatus 
capable of increasing a scanning angle. As is well known, an optical scanning 
apparatus using an optical scanning mirror for changing 
the direction of a reflected beam with respect to an 
incident beam changes the angle of the scanning mirror 
to perform predetermined scanning based on a principle 
of changing the angle of a reflected beam by 2δ upon a 
change in angle of a reflecting surface by a given angle 
δ with respect to the incident beam. Various types of 
optical scanning mirrors are available in accordance 
with forms for mechanically changing the angle of the 
scanning mirror. More specifically, the optical scanning 
mirrors are a polyhedral rotary mirror (e.g., a mirror 
having reflecting surfaces whose angles are equal to or 
different from each other) for changing the angle or 
angles of a plurality of scanning mirrors in one 
direction, a tuning fork for changing the angle of a 
scanning mirror set at each distal end face of a  
 
U-shaped fork by vibrations, a resonant scanner for 
swinging a scanning mirror by reciprocally pivoting a 
rotating shaft mounted with the scanning mirror in a 
plane including the rotating shaft, and the like. An optical scanning apparatus preferably has a 
large scanning angle because it is used as an image 
pickup unit in an apparatus for acquiring, e.g., an 
infrared thermal imagery. However, the scanning angle 
is generally small, and it is difficult to increase it 
because the optical scanning mirror mechanically changes 
the angle of the scanning mirror. More specifically, for example, the scanning 
angle of the polyhedral rotary mirror depends on a 
mechanical rotation angle. For example, a regular 
hexahedral mirror restores its original shape upon 
rotation of 60°, and the limit of the mechanical 
scanning angle is 60°. To obtain a larger scanning 
angle, the number of reflecting surfaces must be 
reduced. This causes an increase in air resistance and 
degradation of scanning efficiency. For example, a 
regular trihedral mirror has a maximum scanning angle of 
120°, and its air resistance is much higher than that of 
the regular hexahedral mirror. The number of scanning 
cycles per revolution of the regular trihedral mirror is 
half that of the regular hexahedral mirror, thereby 
degrading the scanning efficiency.  In a system using one scanning mirror, such as 
a tuning fork or a resonant
