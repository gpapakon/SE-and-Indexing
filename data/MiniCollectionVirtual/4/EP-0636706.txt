<ABSTRACT>
Graphite substrate holders for employment in 
apparatus for chemical vapor deposition of diamond 

decrease the tendency of the formed diamond sheets to 
crack or shatter upon separation from the substrates. Said 

holders and the substrates therein preferably have rounded 
edges, to suppress crack formation at sharp corners. The 

holders are preferably coated, at least in part, with a tie-layer 
and a hydride-forming metal such as niobium. Also, 

certain maximum distances between the edges of the holder 
and substrates are preferably maintained in order to 

prevent contact of diamond with a heated filament 
employed for thermal activation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the chemical vapor 
deposition of diamond. More particularly, it relates to the 
design of holders for substrates on which such diamond is 
deposited, said holders being adapted to easy release of 
diamond sheets formed on such substrates. The chemical vapor deposition (hereinafter 
sometimes "CVD") of diamond on a substrate, said diamond 
being produced by thermal or non-thermal activation of a 
mixture of hydrogen and a hydrocarbon at low pressure, is 
under continuing development in attempts to facilitate the 
production of diamond sheets which can be easily removed 
from the substrate. Such sheets could then be cut into 
diamond articles to be used, for example, as heat sinks in 
electronic devices. Diamond heat sinks would be 
particularly useful by reason of the high thermal 
conductivity of diamond. The preparation of free-standing diamond sheet 
for fabrication of products such as heat sinks is typically 
done in a CVD diamond apparatus in which thermal 
activation is achieved by at least one hot filament. A 
number of substrates, typically square or rectangular 
having relatively unimpeded edges are typically secured in 
said apparatus. For example, the substrates may be held by 
metal tabs in openings in a metal sheet, said openings being 
slightly larger than the substrates. Alternatively, the 
substrates may be fitted with metal pegs and hung from 
slotted beams. The use of substrate holders of this type 
ensures free circulation of the reactant gases and efficient  
 
contact of the heated filament and substrate surfaces 
thereby. A problem routinely encountered, however, is 
cracking or shattering of the diamond sheets when the 
sheets and the substrates on which they are formed are 
cooled subsequent to diamond deposition. There is 
inevitably a difference, often substantial, between the 
coefficient of thermal expansion of the substrate and that 
of the diamond sheet. As a result, fracture of the sheet 
occurs unless the sheet is capable of clean separation from 
the substrate upon cooling. Such clean release is impeded when the edges of 
rectangular substrates remain free, for at least two 
reasons. First, the deposited diamond tends to curl around 
the edges of the substrates rather than forming only on the 
front surface thereof, making clean release impossible. 
Second, compounding of stresses occurs at the corners of 
the substrate, resulting in the initiation of cracks which 
then propagate throughout the diamond sheet. For employment in many heat sink
