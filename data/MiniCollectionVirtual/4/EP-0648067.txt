<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for preheating electrodes of 
a discharge lamp connected in series with a ballast by means of a supply voltage of 

alternating polarity. The circuit arrangement is provided with a switching element (S) 
which is operated by means of a control signal and which shunts the lamp. According to 

the invention, the circuit arrangement is provided with a circuit portion (II) for adjusting 
both the phase and the frequency of the control signal in dependence on whether the 

ballast is inductive or capacitive. It is achieved thereby that the electrodes of the lamp 
are preheated in a short period both when an inductive ballast is used and when a 

capacitive ballast is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for preheating electrodes of
a discharge lamp connected in series with a ballast by means of a supply voltage of
alternating polarity, comprising
a branch A for connection to the electrodes of the discharge lamp, which
branch A comprises a switching element, a control circuit coupled to a control electrode of the switching element
for generating a control signal to render the switching element conducting during
preheating in each cycle of the supply voltage,a first circuit portion I coupled to the control circuit for influencing the
control signal in dependence on whether the ballast is inductive or capacitive.Such a circuit arrangement is known from Netherlands Patent Application
159853 laid open to public inspection. In the known circuit arrangement, the first circuit
portion I comprises a branch which includes a transistor. The control signal is
influenced in that this transistor becomes conducting exclusively if the ballast is
capacitive. It is realised by means of this branch that instability in the operation of the
circuit arrangement in the case of a capacitive ballast is avoided. The known circuit
arrangement can accordingly be used in combination with both inductive ballasts and
capacitive ballasts. A disadvantage of the known circuit arrangement, however, is that
the effective value of the current through branch A, with which the lamp electrodes are
preheated, is comparatively low. The result of this is that it takes a comparatively long
time before the electrodes of the discharge lamp have reached a temperature at which a
sufficient emission of electrons occurs for igniting the discharge lamp at the given
ignition voltage. This comparatively long preheating time is felt to be inconvenient by
users.The invention has for its object to provide a circuit arrangement with
which the electrodes of a discharge lamp can be preheated in a comparatively short
time, both when the ballast connected in series with the discharge lamp is inductive and
when this ballast is capacitive. According to the invention, a circuit arrangement as described in the
opening paragraph is for this purpose characterized in that the first circuit portion I
comprises a second circuit portion II for accordingly adjusting both the phase and the frequency of the
control signal. The phase of the control signal is here understood to mean the time
interval between the moment at which the control signal renders the switching element
conducting and an immediately preceding polarity change
