Mn, 0.010-0.040 wt% of P, 0.001-0.030 wt% of S, 18.0-30.0 

wt% of Cr, 3.0-8.0 wt% of Ni, 0.1-3.0 wt% of Mo, 
and 0.10-0.45 wt% of N, the balance being essentially 

Fe and inevitable impurities, wherein the volume ratio 
of the ferrite amount to the sum of the austenite 

amount and the ferrite amount is specified to be in the 
range from 20.0 to 80.0%. Upon drawing, the drawing 

draft is in the range from 40 to 97%, the average 
aspect ratio (M
R

<DESCRIPTION>
As tension members for prestressed concrete (PC), 
piano wires specified in JIS (Japanese Industrial 
Standard) G 3536 have been mainly used. The piano wire is 
made of a high carbon steel containing 0.62-0.92 wt% of C, 
which is excellent in the properties necessary for a 
tension member or a hanging member, such as tensile 
strength, elongation, relaxation value, fatigue strength, 
reduction of area and torsion value: however, it is 
extremely poor in corrosion resistance (rust resistance). 
For this reason, steel wires for prestressed concrete 
(hereinafter called "PC steel wires"), steel wire strands 
for prestressed concrete (hereinafter called "PC steel wire 
strands"), various cables and hanging members made of the 
above high carbon steel have been subjected to various 
corrosion-proof treatments, for example, plating, plastic 
coating and grout-filling sheath covering. These 
treatments have increased the cost of the PC steel wires 
and the like. On the other hand, stainless steel wire ropes 
typically using SUS304 and SUS316 are mainly used at  
 
present in the field of wire ropes. The stainless steel 
wire rope is low in a fatigue strength, and tends to be 
broken in a short period, resulting in the reduced 
service life when being applied with a cyclic bending or 
the like. As a result, the stainless steel wire ropes. 
notwithstanding the high corrosion resistance, have been 
limited in the applications, that is, not for dynamic use 
but for static use for hanging articles. In recent years, prestressed concrete gets wet in 
acid rain because of the change of environments for the 
worse, and in coast areas, it is covered with splash of 
salt water, resulting in the generation of cracks. 
Concrete has been thus neutralized, and tension members 
in concrete tend to be directly exposed to the 
environments. which has the fear that the safety of the 
concrete structure is degraded. The present invention relates to a two-phase stainless 
steel wire product, and particularly to a new stainless 
steel wire product suitable for PC tension members. cables 
for suspension bridges, and hanger ropes for cable-stayed 
bridges.  
 To cope with the above-described disadvantages, a 
corrosion preventive PC steel wire and a PC steel wire 
strand using SUS304 and SUS316 in JIS G 4308 have been 
developed (for example, "Iron and Steel", Vol. 72, No. 1. 
p78-84, 1986). These stainless steel wires are superior 
in corrosion resistance to high carbon steel wires; 
however, they have disadvantages as follows:
