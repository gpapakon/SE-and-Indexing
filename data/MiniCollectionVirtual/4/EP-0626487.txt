<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an arrangement for insulating and sealing joint-containing building facades (5) with an insulating/covering layer structure (1) which spans joints and exhibits an outer, water-permeable covering layer (2) and at least one inner insulating layer (3) which borders the covering layer (2) and the building facade (5), a bond-free isolation region (6) of the insulating layer (3) of predetermined width being provided in the region of the building joints (4), which region (6) keeps the deformations, which occur in this region of the building joints (4), away from the insulating/covering layer structure (1), in particular the covering layer (2).

Device for the insulation and sealing of building facades (5) comprising
structural joints with an insulating and covering layer structure (1), which

comprises an outer covering layer (2) permeable to water and at least one inner
insulating layer (3) contingent with the covering layer (2) and the building

facade (5),
characterized in that

a separation zone (6) of the insulating layer (3) compliant to shear stress and of
predetermined width is provided in the area of the structural joints (4), which

accommodates deformations occurring in this area of the structural joints (4)
and distances them from the insulating and covering layer structure (1) and in

particular from the covering layer (2).
Device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

the shear-compliant layer comprises a layer of adhesive.
Device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

the shear-compliant layer is an elastomer layer.
Device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

the shear-compliant layer consists of a shear-compliant jointing mortar.
Device according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that

the shear-compliant layer is fibre-reinforced. 
Device according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that

the insulating layer (3) comprises several strata (3a, 3b).
Device according to Claim 7,
characterized in that

in the area of the structural joint (4) the individual strata (3a, 3b) are arranged
detached from and one under the other.
Device according to Claim 7,
characterized in that

it comprises an intermediate detachment zone (6a) in the form of a separation

layer.
Device according to Claim 8,
characterized in that

the separation layer is an adhesive foil or strip attached to the lower insulating
stratum (3a).
Device according to Claim 6,
characterized in that

the individual strata (3a, 3b) are attached to one another in the area of the
structural joint (4) and to the building facade (5) in a shear-compliant way.
Device according to Claim 10,
characterized in that

the shear-compliant connection comprises a compliant adhesive layer. 
Device according to Claim 10,
characterized in that

the shear-compliant connection comprises a shear-compliant jointing mortar.
Device according to Claim 10,
characterized in that

the shear-compliant connection comprises an elastomer layer.
Device according to Claim 10,
characterized in that

the shear-compliant connection is a durable plastic adhesive layer.
Device according to one or more of Claims 1 to 14,
characterized in that

it comprises a joint-separation zone and/or a shear-compliant zone within the
insulating layer (3), such that these zones extend parallel to the building facade.
