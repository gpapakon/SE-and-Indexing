<ABSTRACT>
Errors (offset and amplitude error) of the focus error signal and 
the tracking error signal are detected for at least three track jumps by 

making use of a track jump performed once per rotation of a disk in the 
track following mode (for a spiral disk). An offset value of the focus 

error signal is calculated based on the amplitude of a tracking error 
signal generated for at least two of the track jumps, performed by 

adding a positive or negative offset to the original target value of the 
focus error signal. The values of offset and amplitude error of the 

tracking error signal are calculated based on a maximum value and a 
minimum value of a tracking error signal generated for at least one 

track jump performed without modifying the original target value of the 
focus error signal. Thus calibration of the tracking error signal and 

the focus error signal can be performed repeatedly even when an optical 
disk drive is in the normal operation mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disk drive, and
particular to the problem of calibrating a focus error signal and a
tracking error signal.In an optical disk drive, the tracking servo control and the focus
servo control are performed so as to make a beam spot follow the surface
deflection of a disk and the runout of a track. The position of a beam
spot is controlled so that the tracking error signal becomes zero in the
tracking servo system and the focus error signal becomes zero in the
focus servo system.At present, in optical disk drives, the disk for storing data can
be exchanged. For this reason, the optimum parameters of the servo
system are not always constant. In addition, since disk characteristics
are not uniform, it is necessary to perform self-calibration so that the
parameters of the servo system are optimized.Tracking error signals and focus error signals are calibrated each
time a disk is loaded so that reading, writing, and access can be
performed correctly even in cases where disk characteristics are not
uniform. Since there are cases where characteristics are not uniform
even on one disk, it was typical to perform calibration at several
places in one disk. Such calibration is inconvenient because after a
disk is loaded it takes several seconds in some cases before it becomes
possible to read and write data due to the time-consuming nature of the
calibration.Several calibration methods have been proposed.First, a method disclosed in (1) "86 mm Magneto-optical Disk
Drive," Nakashima et al, SPIE Vol. 1316 Optical Data Storage pp. 16 - 29
(1990) is explained below.The amplitude (TEp-p)det of a tracking error signal to be
generated by disk runout with the tracking servo OFF and the focus servo 
ON each time a disk is loaded is detected and it is compared with a
desired value (TEp-p)typ so as to obtain the specification coefficient
Cte = (TEp-p)typ/(TEp-p)det. Next, the signal level of pre-pit to be
reproduced by adding an offset to the tracking error signal is checked
and positive and negative offset values in levels a level lower than the
maximum value are taken as OFFSET1 and OFFSET2 and the center value is
taken as OFFSETte, a detection offset. With these, the calibrated
tracking error signal TEcal can be calculated by TEcal = Cte * Cagc *
(TE - OFFSETte). Here, Cagc is a compensation coefficient because the-
signal level of pre-pit greatly depends on the laser intensity. For the
focus error signal, the amplitude of an S-shaped curve is measured by
moving the objective lens up
