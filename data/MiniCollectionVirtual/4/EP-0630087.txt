<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for allowing the opposite surfaces of a 
band-shaped or web-like material to be subjected to vacuum 

glow-discharging treatment includes a vacuum housing in which 
two rows of electrodes are arranged with the band-shaped 

material interposed therebetween, and an elongated annular 
hollow space serving as a coolant flow path is formed in each 

electrode. A coolant supplying pipe for supplying a coolant 
through the elongated annular hollow space and a coolant 

discharging pipe for discharging the coolant from the 
elongated annular hollow space are connected to the 

electrode. Stable electricity discharging treatment can be 
conducted for a long time without any occurrence of abnormal 

electricity discharging by preventing the temperature of each 
electrode from being excessively elevated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
an apparatus according to the pramble 
of claim 1 and to a method according to the preamble of claim 5 in 
which opposite surfaces of a web such as a plastic film and a 
metallic sheet is subjected to vacuum glow-discharging 
treatment in a vacuum condition in order to improve adhesive 
property, hydrophilic capability and dyeing capability of the 
web against another web or a coating material. Such an apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from US-A-3 959 104. In the case that a photosensitive material is 
produced, it is well known in the art that opposite surfaces 
of a web-like support made of a plastic film are activated 
before the support is coated with a coating liquid such as an 
emulsion, in order to improve adhesiveness of the coating 
liquid to the support, and hydrophilic capability and dyeing 
capability of the support. In order to activate the opposite 
surfaces of the support, a method wherein opposite surfaces 
of a web-like support are subjected to glow-discharging 
treatment by applying a high voltage to a plurality of 
electrodes arranged so as to face the opposite surfaces of 
the support, is practically used (see official gazettes of 
U.S. Patent No. 3,288,638, Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Publication Nos. 53-13672, 54-80373, 56-1337, 56-1339 and 
5-19899).  
 The method is practiced, for instance, such that a 
support is placed between a pair of metallic electrodes under 
a vacuum condition (e.g., 1,33 to 2,66 Â· 103 Pa (0.01 to 20 Torr)) while applying a 
high voltage of 300 to 3000 V to the pair of electrodes with 
flowing electric current density of 0.5 to 50 mA per a unit 
area of each electrode. An official gazette of Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 53-13672 discloses an 
apparatus for activating the opposite surface of a web-like 
support employing such glow-discharging treatment, wherein a 
plurality of rod-shaped electrodes extending in parallel with 
each other in the transverse direction relative to the web-like 
support are arranged to face the opposite surfaces of 
the web-like support. One side of each rod-shaped electrode 
facing the support is constituted by a curved smooth surface, 
and a plurality of rod-shaped electrodes each designed in 
that way are arranged in the spaced relationship with a 
predetermined gap held between adjacent ones. In this 
apparatus, a distance between the support and the rod-shaped 
electrodes can easily be controlled by properly controlling a 
conveyance path of the support, so
