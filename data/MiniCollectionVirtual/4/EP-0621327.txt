<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to an abrasive tool, a lapping and 
polishing powder and lapping slurry made from a dense, finely 

crystalline boron suboxide material with a Knoop hardness 
KHN₁₀₀ of at least about 2800 kg/mm² and preferably at least 

3800 kg/mm². 
Further provide is a method of removing material from a 
surface comprising the step of abrading a surface with an 

abrasive tool, an abrasive powder or slurry comprising a boron 
suboxide (BxO) composition, wherein during the abrading 

step the boron suboxide (BxO) composition is maintained at 
low temperatures. The abrasive which is from the boron 

suboxide (BxO) family of compounds exhibits an unexpectedly 

high quality of abrading comparable with the highest quality 
particulate natural and synthetic diamond, which has a 

hardness about double that of the boron suboxide (BxO) of the 
present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an abrasive material in the form of 
a tool, a powder or slurry and a method of removing material 
from a surface using an abrasive tool, powder or slurry. Grinding, lapping, polishing and cutting is carried out on 
materials such as metals, ceramics, glass, plastic, wood and 
the like, using bonded abrasives such as grinding wheels, 
coated abrasives, loose abrasives and abrasive cutting tools. 
Abrasive grains, the cutting tools of the abrasive process, 
are naturally occurring or synthetic materials which are 
generally much harder than the materials which they cut. The 
most commonly used abrasives in bonded, coated and loose 
abrasive applications are garnet, alpha alumina, silicon 
carbide, boron carbide, cubic boron nitride, and diamond. 
The relative hardness of the materials can be seen from the 
following table: 
Material KHN₁₀₀ Hardness garnet1360 α-alumina2100 silicon carbide2480 boron carbide2750 cubic boron nitride4500 diamond (monocrystalline)7000 The choice of abrasive is normally dictated by economics, 
finish desired, and the material being abraded. The abrasive 
list above is in order of increasing hardness but it is also 
coincidentally in order of increasing cost with garnet being 
the least expensive abrasive and diamond the most expensive. Generally, a soft abrasive is selected to abrade a soft 
material and a hard abrasive to abrade harder types of  
 
materials in view of the cost of the various abrasive 
materials. There are, of course, exceptions such as very 
gummy materials where the harder materials actually cut more 
efficiently. Furthermore, the harder the abrasive grain the 
more material it will remove per unit volume or weight of 
abrasive. Superabrasive materials include diamond and cubic 
boron nitride, diamond is the hardest known material, and 
cubic boron nitride is the second hardest. One skilled in 
abrasive technology would expect an abrasive material with 
similar properties to perform consistently in relation to 
other materials in a variety of applications (e.g., diamond 
and cubic boron nitride perform similarly relative to each 
other in grinding, lapping and cutting applications). We have found no indication in the literature that boron 
suboxide (BxO) has been used in the abrasives field. Boron 
suboxide (BxO), however, if used would be expected to perform 
as an abrasive in a manner relative to the hardness used. 
With no researcher(s) having reported a KHN₁₀₀ greater than 
3600 kg/mm² for boron suboxide, the boron suboxides
