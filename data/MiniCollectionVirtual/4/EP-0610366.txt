<DESCRIPTION>
 GRAVEL-PACKED PIPELINE AND METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR INSTALLATION THEREOFTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates in general to underground conduits, and more particularly to a gravel-packed pipeline. 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONUnderground conduits are widely used for the transmission of fluids and gases, such as in pipelines and the like, as well as for carrying wires and cables for the transmission of electrical power and electrical communications signals. While the installation of such conduits is time-consuming and costly for locations where the earth can be excavated from the surface, the routing of such conduits becomes more difficult where the surface excavation cannot be done due to the presence of surface obstacles through which the excavation cannot easily proceed. Such surface obstacles include highways and railroads where the installation of a crossing conduit would require the shutdown of traffic during the excavation and installation. Such surface obstacles also include rivers, which present extremely difficult problems for installing a crossing conduit due to their size and difficulty of excavation thereunder. Prior methods for the installation of conduit have included the use of directional drilling for the formation of an enrouted underground arcuate path extending between two surface locations and under the surface obstacle with the conduit installed along the drilled path. A conventional and useful method for installing such underground conduits is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,679,637, issued July 14, 1987, assigned to Cherrington Corporation, and U. S. Patent No. 4,784,230, issued November 15, 1988, assigned to Cherrington Corporation, both of which are incorporated by reference herein.Several shortcomings of the prior methods are discussed in connection with U. S. Application Serial No. 557,992, filed July 26, 1990, entitled "Improved Method and Apparatus for Enlarging an Underground Path", to 

Martin Cherrington and assigned to Cherrington Corporation, which is also incorporated by reference herein. A major concern in forming an underground conduit in a near horizontal position is the removal of cuttings resulting from the reaming operation. These cuttings may inhibit the pre-reaming and reaming operations and further inhibit the installation of the pipeline. It is believed that the cuttings, many of which areheavier than the fluid transporting them, will settle towards the bottom of the underground hole and then build up into a circumferential packed mass,

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS;
1. Apparatus for placing a porous pipe surrounded 5 by filtering material in a horizontal subsurface hole, comprising: a liner pipe for containing the porous pipe during placement of the porous pipe in the hole; apparatus for removing the liner pipe from the hole 10 while maintaining the porous pipe in a desired position within the hole; and a material conveyor pipe coupled to the liner pipe or conveying the filtering material to the hole during removal of the liner pipe. 15
2. The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein said removing apparatus comprises: apparatus for moving an end of the porous pipe outside the liner pipe; and -20 an anchor coupled to the porous
^
pipe for attaching the porous pipe to the subsurface.
3. The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein said removing apparatus comprises:
25 apparatus for creating a pressure differential between the inside and outside of the liner pipe; and a seal disposed between the liner pipe and the porous pipe for moving the porous pipe relative to the liner pipe responsive to the air pressure differential.
30
4. The apparatus of Claim 2 wherein said anchor comprises first and second spring-loaded anchor portions operable to fit within the porous pipe in a compressed position.
35 


 5. The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein said material conveyor pipe is fixedly attached to the liner pipe.
6. The apparatus of Claim 1 and further comprising 5 apparatus coupled to the material conveyor pipe for receiving the material and mixing the material with a compressed gas to force the material through the material conveyor pipe.
10 7. The apparatus of Claim 1 and further comprises positioning means for positioning the liner pipe in the hole to maintain a desired distance between the wall for the hole and the porous pipe.
15 8. Apparatus for retrieving hazardous material from a subsurface area comprising: a porous pipe disposed substantially parallel to the surface, said porous pipe operable to transport the hazardous material; -20 an anchor for holding the porous pipe within the subsurface area; a filtering material layer surrounding the porous pipe to prevent subsurface material from obstructing said porous pipe; and 25 a pump for evacuating material from the pipe.
9. The apparatus of Claim 8 wherein said anchor comprises first and second anchor members and a spring for forcing the anchor members apart.
30
10. The apparatus of Claim 8 wherein said filtering material layer comprises a gravel layer.
11. The apparatus of Claim 8 wherein said porous 35 pipe comprises a slotted pipe. 


 12. The apparatus of Claim 11 wherein said slotted pipe comprises a PVC slotted pipe.
13. A method of installing a material-packed porous pipe in a subterranean hole comprising the steps of: placing a liner pipe containing the porous pipe and coupled to a conveyor pipe in the subsurface hole; anchoring the porous pipe within the hole; and simultaneously removing the liner pipe and transporting the material through the conveyor pipe to the hole to surround the porous pipe.
14. The method of Claim 13 wherein said anchoring step comprises the steps of forcing an end of the porous pipe out of the liner pipe and extending anchor members attached to the end of the pipe to contact the sides of the hole.
15. The method of Claim 14 wherein said forcing step comprises the step of creating a pressure differential between the inside and outside of the liner pipe.
16. The method of Claim 13 wherein said removing step includes the step of removing the liner pipe such that the porous pipe is maintained at a desired distance from the walls of the hole.
17. The method of Claim 16 wherein said removing step includes the step of spacing the liner pipe from the walls of the hole. 


 18. The method of Claim 13 wherein said removing step comprises the step of simultaneously removing the liner pipe and transporting gravel through the conveyor pipe to the hole to surround the porous pipe.
19. The method of Claim 13 and further comprising the step of removing cuttings from the hole prior to placing the liner pipe therein.
20. The method of Claim 19 wherein said step of removing cuttings comprises the step of removing the cuttings using a jet pump.
