<ABSTRACT>
A post card with a decoration sticker and a method for 
production of the post card. The sticker of the post card 

has an excellent decorating effect and an improved 
durability and is reusable, while the releasable mount 

paper printed with post card form may be used as a post 
card. One side of the mount paper is printed with figures 

or letters, while the other side is printed with a post 
card form. A release film layer is formed on the one side 

of the mount paper. An adhesive material layer is formed 
on the release film layer of the mount paper in 

predetermined figures through a silk screen printing. The 
adhesive material layer is heated so as to form a base 

layer on the adhesive material layer. A color print part 
is formed on the base layer by separately printing colors 

on the base layer using color print inks while carrying out 
a heat treatment after every color printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to decoration 
stickers used for decorating a surface and, more 
particularly, to a post card with such decoration sticker 
as well as to a method for production of the post card, 
which sticker is directly formed on a releasable mount 
paper by forming an adhesive material layer as well as a 
base layer on one side of the releasable mount paper in 
desired figures through a silk screen printing so that the 
printed figures of the sticker are integrated with the base 
layer into a single body, thus to directly form the 
decoration sticker on the releasable mount paper, and which 
mount paper is printed with post card form on the other 
side thereof so that the mount paper with the decoration 
sticker may used as a post card. In order to produce a typical decoration sticker, an 
adhesive material is totally applied on one side of a 
releasable mount paper. Thereafter, the raw material of 
sticker is bonded to the one side of the mount paper. At  
 
this time, the raw material is simply bonded to the paper 
due to viscosity of the adhesive material applied on the 
mount paper. The sticker raw material is, thereafter, 
printed with desired figures, thus to form a sticker sheet 
having the figures. The releasable mount paper with the 
printed sticker sheet in turn is subjected to a cutting 
step for cutting the mount paper as well as the sticker 
sheet into a desired shape. The cutting step is carried 
out using a cutter having a cutting edge of the same shape 
as the printed figures of the sticker. The remains of the 
mount paper as well as of the sticker sheet will be 
discarded after the cutting step. In use of the sticker, 
the sticker is released from the releasable mount paper and 
stuck on a surface to be decorated. However, the decoration sticker produced by the above 
method has a problem that the adhesive material layer 
should be formed on all the one side of the releasable 
mount paper regardless of area of desired figures of the 
sticker and this increases the cost of the stickers. When 
releasing the sticker from the mount paper, the adhesive 
material may remain on the mount paper so that the sticking 
power of the sticker may be reduced. Moreover, the 
adhesive material may be stuck to user's fingers and make 
the fingers dirty. The desired figures are printed on the 
sticker raw material through a typical surface printing so 
that the printed figures will be smeared on others during 
use of the sticker. The figures, printed on the sticker  
 
raw

<CLAIMS>
An adhesive label assembly comprising: 
   a mounting element (10), one side (12) of said 

mounting element (10) being a label side and the other 
side (11) of the mounting element (10) being an 

underside; 
   a release film layer (13) formed on the label 

side (12) of the mounting element (10), 
   an adhesive material layer (14) formed on the 

release film layer (13) in predetermined shapes 
corresponding to label shapes; 

   a base layer (15) formed on the adhesive 
material layer (14) in the same shapes as the adhesive 

material layer (14); and 
   a printed pattern (16) formed on the base layer 

so that the printed pattern is integrated with the base 
layer (15) into one body forming a label. 
An adhesive label assembly as claimed in claim 
1, in which the printed pattern (16) comprises a colour 

print, the colour print inks comprising polyvinyl 
chloride, polyvinyl butyrate, pigments and additives. 
An adhesive label assembly as claimed in any 
preceding claim in which the label comprises a 

decorative sticker. 
An adhesive label assembly as claimed in claim 
3, in which the label side (12) of the mounting element 

(10) is printed with a printed pattern. 
An adhesive label assembly as claimed in any 
preceding claim in which the underside (11) of the 

mounting element is printed in a postcard form. 
A method for producing an adhesive label on a 
base (10) comprising the steps of: 

   forming a release film layer (13) on one side 
(12) of a mounting element (10), thereby to prepare a 

releasable mounting surface;
 

   applying a viscous adhesive material (14) on 
the release film layer (13) in predetermined shapes 

corresponding to label shapes through silk screen 
printing and, thereafter, heating the adhesive material 

(14) applied on the release film layer (13), thereby to 
form an adhesive material layer (14) and a base layer 

(15), integrated into one body forming a label; and 
   forming a print (16) on the heat-treated 

adhesive material. 
A method as claimed in claim 6, in which the 
step of forming a print comprises separately printing 

colours on the heat-treated adhesive material in the 
predetermined shapes using colour print inks while 

carrying out a heat treatment at approximately 150°C 
after every colour printing step. 
A method as claimed in claim 7, in which said 
colour print inks comprise polyvinyl chloride, 

polyvinyl butyrate, appropriate amounts of pigments and 
additives, and in which the step of forming a print 

further comprises heating the colour print part at a 
fixing temperature ranging from 180°C to 200°C. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 6 to 
8, in which the mounting element (10) is prepared by 

printing a pattern on one side of the mounting element 
(10) so as to form a label side (12), and printing a 

post card form on the other side (11) of the mounting 
element (10) so as to form a post card side (11). 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 6 to 
9, in which the adhesive label comprises a decorative 

sticker.
