<ABSTRACT>
A spring-compressing apparatus (1) for compressing a helical spring (2) of a motor vehicle MacPherson strut suspension is known, which comprises two spring compressors (3, 4) with threaded spindle (5, 5/1) which is equipped with a draw hook (6, 6/1) along which a compressing element (7, 7/1) with compressing hook (9, 9/1) is movable towards the draw hook (6, 6/1), the two spring compressors (3, 4) being interconnected by a safety bracket (17) which is guided by means of two longitudinally displaceable guide bushes (10, 10/1) and is provided in three lengths. Said spring compressor (1) is suitable only for compressing helical springs (2) of very specific diameters and has to be dismounted for length adjustment of the safety bracket (17). Furthermore, the guide bushes (10, 10/1) are displaced, during compression, directly on the threaded spindles (5, 5/1), with the result that the latter are damaged during the compressing operation. To avoid these disadvantages, the safety bracket (17) is equipped with two outer retaining brackets (18 and 19) which are connected by their respective outer end to the respective guide bush (10 and 10/1) of one of the two associated compressing elements (7 and 7/1). Furthermore, the retaining brackets (18 and 19) can be variably locked along a central adjusting rail (20) for length adjustment of the safety bracket (17) and can be pivoted to a limited extent in each fixed position on the adjusting rail (20).
