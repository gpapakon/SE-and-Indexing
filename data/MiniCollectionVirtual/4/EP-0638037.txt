<ABSTRACT>
Folding frames for children's or dolls' prams essentially have two front and two rear stays crossed scissors-fashion which are secured to bearing stays. The variable lower pivot points of the front and rear stays, however, lead to a highly unstable system also subject to mechanical stresses, while the crossing point of the front and rear stays results in reductions in their cross-section. A solution to this problem is found in that the stays (1, 2) are hinged on immovable pivot points (7) on connecting stays (10) in the lower region and in the central region there is, at the crossing point of the stays (1, 2), a connecting component (4) having a bush (6) arranged to be movable along one of the two stays (1, 2), the bush (6) being connected to a pivot (5) in the central region of the other stay (1, 2).

Collapsible frame for children's or dolls' 
prams which has two front struts (1) and two rear 

struts (2) which cross one another in pairs in the 
manner of scissors and are connected to supporting 

struts (3), the top ends of the rear struts (2) being 
connected to the supporting struts (3) via pivot points 

(8), while a pushing means (11) for pushing the pram is 
arranged in the top region of the front struts (1) and 

is articulated on the front struts (1) via a pivot 
point, while the supporting struts (3) are connected to 

the pushing means (11) via a pivot point, the pushing 
means (11) and the front struts (1) being firmly 

connected to one another in the use position and the 
pushing means (11) thus running parallel to the front 

struts (1) and in extension thereof, the front and rear 
struts (1; 2) being articulated, in the bottom region, 

on connecting struts (10) and being articulated 
pivotably to one another in their central region, at 

their crossover point, characterized in that the front 
and rear struts (1; 2), in the bottom region, are 

articulated laterally on the connecting struts (10) at 
non-displaceable pivot points (7; 25) and, in the 

central region, a connecting member (4) is arranged in 
each case at the crossover point of the front strut (1) 

and the rear strut (2), which connecting member has a 
bushing (6) which is arranged such that it can be 

displaced along one of the two struts (1; 2), the 
bushing (6) being connected to a pivot point (5) in the 

central region of the other struts (1; 2). 
Collapsible frame according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that a link plate (14) is firmly  

 
arranged on the bushing (6) of the connecting member 

(4) and receives a bolt (16) which is arranged 
rotatably in a bore in the strut (1; 2) which does not 

bear the bushing (6), the bore forming the pivot point 
(5). 
Collapsible frame according to Claim 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the bushing (6) is arranged on 

the rear strut (2) and the central pivot point (5) is 
arranged in the front strut (1). 
Collapsible frame according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that, in the use position, the front 

strut (1) and rear strut (2), which cross in the manner 
of scissors in their central region, form two closed 

triangles which stand one upon the other by their 
vertices, the struts (1; 2) forming the lateral sides 

in each case and the base side being formed by the 
associated supporting strut (3), on the one hand, and 

by the corresponding bottom connecting strut (10), on 
the other hand. 
Collapsible frame according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the connecting struts (10) form a 

rigid U-shaped frame (22) which is closed in the 
direction of travel and in which the connecting struts 

(10) are formed as rearwardly oriented legs, the closed 
section being located in front of the non-displaceable 

pivot point (7), at which the front struts (1) are 
articulated on the connecting struts (10), while the 

rear struts (2) are articulated in the region of the 
rear ends of the leg-forming connecting struts (10). 
Collapsible frame according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the bottom ends of the struts (1; 

2) project beyond the pivot points (7) located in the 
bottom, rigid frame (22) and are formed as extensions 

(18) on which the wheels (9) are arranged. 
Collapsible frame according to one or more of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the two rear 

struts (2) are connected to one another at their bottom 
ends by a transverse strut, forming with the latter a 

rear, closed U-shaped frame (23) which is articulated  
 

in the rear region of the connecting struts (10) at the 
mutually opposite, non-displaceable pivot points (25), 

the connecting struts (10) having downwardly bent 
extensions (26) which project rearwards beyond the 

pivot points (25) and on which the rear wheels (9b) are 
arranged, while the front wheels (9a) are arranged on 

bottom extensions (18) which belong to the front struts 
(1) and project downwards beyond the pivot point (7). 
Collapsible frame according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that, in the region in which they form 

the rigid U-shaped frame (23), the two rear struts (2) 
are bent rearwards such that they run approximately 

parallel to the connecting struts (10). 
Collapsible frame according to Claims 5, 7 and 
8, characterized in that the U-shaped frame (23) formed 

by the rear struts (2) is arranged above the U-shaped 
frame (22) formed by the connecting struts (10), the 

two frames (22; 23) being connected to one another on 
their two sides by a link plate (24) in each case, and 

the link plates (24) being firmly arranged on the 
connecting struts (10), and the rear struts (2) being 

articulated above the connecting struts (10) at the 
non-displaceable pivot points (25) arranged in the top 

region of the link plates (24). 
Collapsible frame according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that the U-shaped frames (22; 23) are

the non-displaceable pivot point (25). 
Collapsible frame according to Claims 6 and 7,
