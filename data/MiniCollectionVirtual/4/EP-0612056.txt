<ABSTRACT>
A music box 10 comprising a blower unit 15 and a flute 
unit 23. Each flute 23a in the flute unit 23 includes a 

mouth 28a and a wind inlet hole 133a for feeding air to the 
mouth 28a and the wind inlet holes 133a for feeding air to 

the flute are selectively opened and closed to produce a 
desired melody. Further, an air outflow hole 55 is 

provided in a wind trunk 31 of the blower unit 15 and a 
disk 42 having holes for cyclically opening/closing the 

hole 55 is rotatably provided. Thus the pressure of wind 
fed to each flute changes at a predetermined frequency. As 

a member for recording a melody, the following two methods 
are available. One method is a disk 21 having protrusions 

22 for pressing key members 66e of the flute unit and 
another method is a perforated web 210 which opens and 

closes the air inlet hole 133a of the flute unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a music box which 
employs flutes and which may be used in toys or fancy 
goods. A music box of the prior art employing flutes includes 
a blower unit and a flute unit. The flute unit has wind 
inlet holes for feeding air to the flutes. The wind inlet 
holes are selectively opened and closed, to produce a 
desired melody, by key members. As a means for recording 
a melody, a disk containing protrusions for pressing the 
key members of the flute unit has been utilized. US-A-3,982,459 discloses a music-producing mechanism 
using flutes. The mechanism includes a fan, which 
supplies air to a wind chest, and is coupled to a motor. 
This chest is utilized in conjunction with valve actuators 
and valves which control the release of air so as to create 
sound. However, in this type of music producing mechanism 
which introduces wind through a flue to play a flute, the 
amount of fed air is large and constant, so that the tone 
of the generated sound is sharp and rigid. Thus, the 
development of a music box which is capable of generating 
a softer, more comfortable sound has been long desired. In accordance with the present invention, the above 
object is achieved by providing a music box comprising a 
blower unit, a flute unit including a plurality of flutes 
having different musical pitches, a wind trunk for 
introducing wind from the blower unit, a wind pressure 
control means for vibrating the wind pressure in the wind 
trunk and a wind feeding control means for selectively 
feeding wind to respective flutes. A preferred example of the wind pressure control means 
is a combination of a hole made in the wall of the wind 
trunk and an opening/closing member for opening or closing 
the hole at a predetermined frequency. A preferred 
example of the wind feeding control means is a valve unit  
 
which opens or closes the wind trunk of each flute. 
Another example of the wind feeding control means is a 
travelling web including a plurality of holes for opening 
wind inlets of the flutes. In the music box according to the present invention, 
the air pressure leading from a blower unit to the flutes 
is regularly increased or decreased at a predetermined 
frequency. Thus, the tone of sound generated by the flutes 
is changed by the a wind pressure vibration generating 
means. Those sounds have a softly vibrating tone like a 
tremolo generated when a person plays a flute.

the music box according to the present invention; Fig. 2

<CLAIMS>
A music box (10) comprising a blower unit (15) having 
a fan (27,201) and connected to a wind trunk (29,207); a 

flute unit (23,203) including flutes (23,203) each having 
a wind inlet hole (133,211) and a mouth (28); a wind chest 

(31,209) connected to the wind trunk; a wind control means 
(42,210) which opens the wind inlet holes in a preselected 

sequence to control the flow of air from the wind chest 
(31,209) to the flutes; and a means (55,206) for vibrating 

the air pressure in the wind chest. 
A music box according to claim 1, wherein the air 
pressure is vibrated at a frequency of between 17 and 19 

cps. 
A music box according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
the means for vibrating the air pressure includes an air 

outflow hole (55,206) in a wall of the wind trunk (29,207), 
and a disk (42,243) which is rotated in contact with the 

wall and has holes (41,242) which pass over, to open and 
close, the hole in the wall. 
A music box according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the wind control means is a valve unit (62) 

including a respective valve (64) for blocking each wind 
inlet hole (133) and operated by a respective key member 

(66) which protrudes from a wall of the wind chest (31). 
A music box according to claim 4, wherein the key 
member (66) is moved to operate the valve (64) by a 

respective projection (22) on a rotary disk (21). 
A music box according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the wind control means includes an endless web 

(210) which is arranged to be advanced between the wind 
chest (209) and the wind inlet holes (211a) to close the 

 
wind inlet holes except when holes (241) in the web are in 

alignment with the wind inlet holes.
