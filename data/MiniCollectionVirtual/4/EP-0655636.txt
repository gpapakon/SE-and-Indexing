<ABSTRACT>
An improved eyepiece for an optical system. In 
general, the inventive eyepiece (10) includes a 

refractive element (16) and an optical arrangement for 
relaying the entrance pupil of the system to the 

refractive element. In a specific implementation, the 
optical arrangement includes a concave primary mirror 

(12) and a secondary mirror (14). The mirrors are 
mounted to communicate an image from the refractive 

element (16) to the entrance pupil (40). In the specific 
implementation, the refractive element (16) is one or 

more refractive lenses. The use of a reflective optical 
arrangement allows for the long eye relief. The 

placement of the entrance pupil close to the pupil of the 
lens allows for the use of a compact optical arrangement 

with high ratio of eye relief to effective focal length 
with a compact optical arrangement. The system affords 

minimal lateral chromatic aberration and good image 
quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optics. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to eyepieces 
for optical instruments. While the present invention is described herein with 
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular 
applications, it should be understood that the invention 
is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in 
the art and access to the teachings provided herein will 
recognize additional modifications, applications, and 
embodiments within the scope thereof and additional 
fields in which the present invention would be of 
significant utility. Many optical systems including microscopes, 
telescopes, binoculars and the like, include an eyepiece 
into which the user peers to observe an image provided by 
the system. The conventional eyepiece, such as that 
disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 2,423,676, entitled 
EYEPIECE, issued July 8, 1947 to Fred E. Altman is 
typically constructed with an arrangement of refractive 
optical elements or lenses. Eye relief is an important consideration in the 
design of an optical system. Eye relief is the distance  
 
between the iris of the eye of the observer and the first 
surface of the first lens of the system. For reasons of safety and convenience, a long eye 
relief is desirable. In weapons systems, for example, an 
optical instrument may be utilized as a sighting 
mechanism. For certain weapons such as rocket and 
missile launchers, long eye relief is desired to prevent 
injury to the user due to any recoil of the weapon when 
the weapon is fired. In microscopes, long eye relief 
allows the user to view the sample under examination from 
a convenient distance causing less effort, eye strain and 
stress. However, there are several countervailing 
considerations which prevent the designer from optimizing 
the system on the basis of eye relief alone. The first is the general requirement that the 
field-of-view of the eyepiece equal the field-of-view of 
the user. With the typical focusing lenses of the 
conventional refractive eyepiece, when the observer's eye 
is at the pupil position, the observer will see the 
entire image located at the eyepiece image plane. As the 
observer moves his eye longitudinally away from the 
eyepiece, the outer portion of the field-of-view will 
first be vignetted and then finally disappear. 
Therefore, the sizes of the lenses have to increase 
almost linearly with respect to the longitudinal eye 
displacement or eye relief in order to maintain the same 
field-of-view. Unfortunately, the edge
