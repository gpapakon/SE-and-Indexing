<ABSTRACT>
Method of manufacturing plasterboards comprising a gypsum 
layer between two cardboard sheets adhering to said gypsum 

layer, a mixture of calcined gypsum, water, wetting agent 
and starch being applied between the cardboard sheets. The 

mixture comprises also at least one low molecular weight 
carbohydrate with a migration velocity which is higher than 

that of starch in order to strengthen the adhesion between 
the gypsum and the cardboard sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
plasterboards comprising a gypsum layer between two cardboard 
sheets adhering to said gypsum layer, a mixture of 
calcined gypsum, water, wetting agent and starch being 
applied between the cardboard sheets. In this method of manufacture, the sandwhich method 
as it is called, the starch functions as a binding agent 
which is used for strengthening the adhesion between the 
gypsum and the cardboard sheets as well as for binding the 
gypsum material. The starch is then used in an amount of 
0.25-0.75 % of the final weight of the plasterboard. Among 
the different types of starch, corn starch is the 
dominating type of binding agent in this connection. The 
anchorage mechanism between the gypsum layer and the cardboard 
sheet is complicated and dependent on the gypsum 
crystals formed as well as the type of starch used. It has 
been demonstrated by several investigations that after 
application of the mixture between the cardboard sheets an 
increased concentration of starch is obtained at the interface 
between the gypsum layer and the cardboard sheets, 
which provides the necessary adhesion between the gypsum 
and the cardboard sheets. When the mixture has been applied between the cardboard 
sheets it is subjected to a drying process to eliminate 
surplus water not bound during hardening of the 
gypsum, i.e. the formation of the dihydrate of calcium 
sulphate. During the drying process the temperature in the 
gypsum layer will increase and the free water content will 
evaporate, the vapour penetrating the cardboard sheets and 
being removed by the ambient air. However, at the same time 
as the free water is heated a gelatination of the starch 
takes place at 67-70Â°C. The starch migrates towards said  
 
interface, partly in form of starch grains not swelled and 
partly as completely or partially gelatinized starch. This 
migration is obstructed as the starch is gelatinized and 
swells, more and more water being emitted at the same time. 
Thus, during the heating of the water containing gypsum 
layer the migration of starch towards the interface between 
gypsum and cardboard sheets is critical since the water 
content will all the time be reduced by evaporation and the 
concentration of relatively high viscous, macromolecular 
and gelatinized starch will be increased. The migration of 
the starch ceases eventually, and if such migration has not 
been extensive enough, the adhesion between the gypsum 
layer and the cardboard sheets will be insufficient.
