<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nail enamels, also known
as nail lacquers.Nail enamels conventionally comprise a film forming
component, which is frequently nitrocellulose, cellulose
acetate butryrate, or a combination of one or both of those
cellulosics with a polyurethane or other polymeric compound.
Nail enamels have also traditionally included plasticizers,
typically a phthalate such as dibutyl phthalate, or camphor,
and have also typically included as a plasticizer and/or
adhesion promoter a polymeric component formed by condensation
polymerization of formaldehyde or other aldehyde, typically
an aromic sulfonamide-aldehyde condensation resin such as o,
p-toluene sulfonamide formaldehyde resin.GB 2002795A (corresponding to FR 2397186 A) relates to
a nail enamel composition comprising an alkylvinylether/maleic
anhydride ester-based resin film-former, a plasticizer such
as an alkyl phthalate, and solvent.EP 0170000 A discloses a low viscosity nail polish
composition for application using a pen-like means. The
composition may include formaldehyde condensation products and
phthalates.It is desirable that a nail enamel contain reduced
amounts of phthalates and aldehyde (e.g. formaldehyde)
condensation products, in order to alleviate concerns that
some wearers may be sensitized to phthalate or uncondensed
aldehyde in the nail enamel. It is also desirable to reduce
or eliminate volatile components such as camphor, since the 
volatility leads to loss of the component which causes
variability in the performance of the nail enamel. However,
attempts to formulate such nail enamels have encountered
difficulties because the nail enamel's desired properties such
as long wear, high gloss, resistance to chipping on the nail,
and compatibility with other nail enamel ingredients, are
sensitive to changes in the ingredients in the nail enamel and
to changes in the amounts of those ingredients. Therefore,
there is still a need for a nail enamel formulation exhibiting
satisfactory properties and containing little or no phthalate
and/or aldehyde condensation products. Briefly stated, the present invention is a nail
enamel comprising a film forming component, a solvent
component, and a plasticizer component, wherein the
plasticizer component comprises one or more compounds
selected from the group consisting of compounds of formulae
(I) to (III):
(II)   R1-C(O)-OCH2-C(CH3)2CH2O-C(O)R2(III)   R1-C(O)-O(Y)d-C(O)-R2.In formulae (I) to (III) R1, R2 and R3 are the same
or different and represent (i) linear or branched alkyl
