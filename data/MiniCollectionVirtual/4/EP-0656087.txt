<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a building block 
having interlocking formations, to a corner block for use 
with such a building block and to a construction comprising 
two or more such blocks in interlocking engagement or one 
such building block in interlocking engagement with a 
corner block. In the past it has been known to provide a building 
block comprising a rectangular parallelepiped having three 
pairs of opposing surfaces in which one of the pairs of 
opposing surfaces is provided with complimentary 
interengaging formations while the remaining pairs of 
opposing surfaces remain substantially planer. An example 
of one such arrangement is provided in GB-A-2,075,571 which 
describes a brick suitable for constructing a wall or the 
like having a major surface which includes, spaced from the 
edge of the brick, two upraised projections and an opposite 
major surface which includes, spaced from the edges of the 
brick, two corresponding recesses, the projections and 
recesses being arranged so that two identical bricks may be 
placed end to end with their projections uppermost and a 
third identical brick placed on top of the other two with 
one of its recesses accommodating one projection from one 
of said two bricks and one of its recesses accomodating one 
projection from the other of said two bricks thereby 
interlocking the bricks. A further example of this kind of arrangement is 
provided in GB-A-2,185,276 in which there is described a 
generally rectangular interlocking building block having 
complimentary projections and recesses on opposite of its 
major surfaces, the projections being provided by ribs 
arranged to form at least one upstanding cruciform shape. One of the problems with building blocks of this type 
however is that in order to erect a construction, such as a 
vertical wall, the blocks must be arranged in one of the  
 
limited number of orientations in which their major 
surfaces are substantially horizontal. This limits 
not only the design of any constructions incorporating 
the blocks but also slows down the actual laying 
process since each block must first be correctly 
orientated before then being placed in engagement with 
those already in position. In a different field it has been known to provide 
a paving block having a pair of opposed, parallel, 
substantially planar surfaces but with side walls and 
end walls contoured to provide an interengagement with 
adjacent blocks when laid on a surface. An example of 
one such arrangement is provided in GB-B-2,120,699
