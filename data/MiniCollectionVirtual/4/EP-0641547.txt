<ABSTRACT>
For a quick, precise surgical procedure for fusion of vertebrae (17, 18) there is proposed an implantation system in which the operating instruments such as drill, chisel, bone cutter and implant insertion tool interact with an auxiliary device which permits accurate and quick attachment of the respective tool. The auxiliary device may be an elongated guide instrument which consists of guide rails (11, 12) or a guide cylinder and possesses a spreading device (114-116). A spacer which is inserted in the gap after spreading of the affected vertebrae can also be designed as an auxiliary device.

<CLAIMS>
Implantation system comprising an implant (60, 70, 80) for
the immobilization of vertebrae, said implant being provided on

its exterior with keys (66, 67, 75) and/or grooves (76, 85)
which run in longitudinal direction of the implant (60, 70,

80), and an elongated guide instrument (10, 20) which comprises
longitudinal grooves (15) or longitudinal keys (16, 21, 22),

respectively, which are adapted to the keys (66, 67, 75) and/or
the grooves (76, 85) of the implant (60, 70, 80), wherein the

implant (60, 70, 80) can be pushed in a prepared cavity (61)
between adjacent vertebrae (17, 18) by being guided via the

longitudinal grooves (15) and the longitudinal keys (16, 21,
22), respectively, of the guide instrument (10, 20) cooperating

with the corresponding keys (66, 67, 75) and/or grooves (76,
85) of the implant (60, 70, 80).
Implantation system according to claim 1, wherein the
implant (60, 80) is in the form of a rectangular block or in

the form of a cylinder.
Implantation system according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
implant (70) is U-shaped, and wherein the grooves (76) and/or

the keys (75) are formed on its free U-limbs (71).
Implantation system according to one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the guide instrument (10, 20) is designed in form of

two guide rails (11, 12), which are arranged parallel to each
other and which form one component, or is in form of a

cylindrical tube (20).
Implantation system according to one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein longitudinal keys (16) on the guide instrument (10) are

arranged to be exchangeable.
