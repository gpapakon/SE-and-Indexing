<ABSTRACT>
A device for taking lines, such as a cable or pipe through an entrance (1) aperture in a wall (3) separating two fire sections from one another, includes a partitioning (or bulkhead) box sealed against the wall (3) in the wall entrance (1) and forming a through-running entrance (6) opening out of both sides of the wall (3) and accommodating the cables or pipes. An air-feed blower (11) is provided in the partitioning box and, in the event of a fire, generates a stream of air in the through entrance (6). Air suction orifices (12) open into the through-entrance (6) and communicate with the suction side (11') of the air-feed blower (11).

Device for the feeding-through of lines (2), such as cables or tubes, through an aperture (1) 
in a wall (3) separating two tire sections, with a compartiuent (4) which is situated in the wall 

opening (1) and sealed off from the wall (3) and which formed a feed through aperture (6) which 
terminates on both sides of the wall (3) and which accommodates the lines (2) and in which fire-protection 

and/or extinguishing agents (18) only take effect and close the feed-through apertures 
in the event of fire, and with at least one air blower (11) which is situated in the compartment (4) 

outside the feed-through aperture (6) and which in the event of fire generates a flow of air in the 
said feed-through aperture (6), characterised by the fact that in the feed-through aperture (6), at 

least in its end zones, on both sides of the wall (3), air section intake apertures (12, 12') terminate 
which are connected with the suction intakes side (11') of the air blower (11), of which the 

pressure side (11") is connected to at least one air outlet aperture (13) on each side of the wall (3), 
control means (14) being provided by which in the event of fire, only the air outlet aperture on the 

"fire side" of the wall is connected with the air blower (11). 
Device in according with Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the air suction intake 
apertures (12, 12') are distributed over the entire length of the feed-through aperture (6). 
Device in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised by the fact that the air suction intake 
aperture (12, 12') connect the feed-through aperture (6) with suction intake chamber (16) which is 

otherwise separated from it and in which the air blower (11) terminates by its suction intake side 
(11'). 
Device in accordance with Claim 3, characterised by the fact that air suction intake apertures 
(12, 12') pass through a partition wall (15) separating the feed-through aperture (6) from the 

suction intake chamber (16). 
Device in accordance with Claim 4, characterised by the fact that the suction intake chamber 
(16) extends, in the longitudinal direction of the line, over the length of the feed-through aperture 

(6). 
Device in accordance with Claim 4 or 5, characterised by the fact that the partition wall (15) 
is provided, on the side facing towards the feed-through aperture (6) with a fire protection agent 

in the form of intumescent material (18) which in the event of fire, foams up from the effect of the 
heat, thus closing the air suction intake apertures (12, 12') in the expansion zone of the 

intumescent material.  
 
Device in accordance with Claim 6, characterised by the fact that the partition wall (15) is 
provided, on the side corresponding to the suction intake chambers, with a metal plate (17) 

connected with the intumescent material (18). 
Device in accordance with any one of Claims 1-7, characterised by the fact that the air 
blower (I I) is connected on the outlet side to flow channels (19) which are provided in the 

compartment (4) and which lead to the air outlet apertures (13) and which contain the control 
means (14), taking the form of adjustable shut-off devices, of which the control system is so 

designed that in the event of fire in one of the two fire sections that shut-off device is closed which 
is situated in the flow channel (19) leading to the air outlet aperture (13) which is present on the 

other side of the wall (3), aiid which faces away from the fire. 
Device iii accordance with Claim 9, characterised by the fact that the flow channels (19) are 

provided with one common closure body (20) which forms the control means (14) and which in 
each of the flow channels (19) is adjustable to an end position which it seals off the flow channel 

(19) in question. 
Device in accordance with Claim 9, characterised by the fact that the closure body (20) 
consists of a fire-resisting material such as calcium silicate and is provided with a covering (21) of 

intumescent material. 
Device iii accordance with any one of Claims 1-10, characterised by the fact that the air 
outlet apertures (13) are positioned in the outlet zone of the feed-through aperture (6) and are so 

designed that the flow of air emerging from them is directed over the entire width of the feed-through 
aperture (6), onto the lines (2) emerging from the feed-through aperture (6) concerned. 
Device in accordance with Claim 11, characterised by the fact that the air outlet aperture 
(13) extends along the edge (4"') of the end walls (4") of the compartment (4) which faces 

towards the feed-through aperture (6) and the flow channels (19) mainly extend over the entire 
internal surface of the end walls (4"). 
Device in accordance with Claim 12, characterised by the fact that the compartment (4) is 
provided with a dividing wall (30) which on the one hand in conjunction with the wall of the  

 
compartment forms the flow channel while on the other hand in conjunction with the wall of the 

compartment it forms the flow channel. 
Device iii accordance with Claim 13, characterised by the fact that the air suction aperture 
(12, 12') provided iii the end zones of the feed-through aperture (6) take the form of a continuous 

gap, extending over the width of the feed-through aperture (6), between the dividing wall (30) on 
the one hand and the partition wall (15) on the other. 
Device in accordance with Claim 14, characterised by the fact that the dividing wall (30) is 
provided, in each of the two end zones of the feed-through aperture (6), with an edge (31) facing 

towards the freed-through aperture (6) and extending between the air suction intake apertures (12) 
and the air outlet apertures (13), and is provided, on the said edge, with flexible curtains (8, 9) of 

an inorganic fireproof textile material, which hand down into the feed-through aperture (6). 
Device in accordance with Claim 4, or one of the further claims referring thereto, 
characterised by the fact that the suction chamber (16) contains wire wool of copper or of some 

other material of good thermal conductivity, through which the air taken in by suction flows and 
which is in heat-conducting contact with the walls surrounding the suction intake chamber, 

particularly the dividing wall (30).
