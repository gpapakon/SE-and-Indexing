<DESCRIPTION>
 Xii -fiProdrugs of Imidazole Carboxylic Acids as Angiotensin II Receptor AntagonistsField of the Invention This invention relates to substituted imidazoles useful as angiotensin II (All) blockers, and more particularly, to prodrugs of imidazole carboxylic acids which are All antagonists useful in treating hypertension or congestive heart failure.Background of the Invention Compounds which inhibit the action of the hormone angiotensin II (All) and are useful in alleviating angiotensin induced hypertension constitute the subject matter of a tremendous amount of research.PCT Application, International Publication Number WO 92/00977 published January 23, 1992, discloses 4- alkylimidazole derivatives useful as angiotensin II antagonist antihypertensive agents.Carini and Duncia, European Patent Application Publication Number (EPA) 0 253 310, published January 20, 1988, discloses a class of imidazole angiotensin II antagonists useful for treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. The compounds are active when administered by intravenous injection. Several of the compounds are also orally active. The general disclosure encompasses certain 4- alkyl-2-propyl-l-[ (2 '- (lH-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl) - methyl] imidazoles substituted at the 5-position of the imidazole ring with halogen, nitro, trifluoromethyl or cyano. 

 Carini, Duncia and Wong, International Application Publication Number WO 89/06233, published July 13, 1989, discloses the same class of imidazole angiotensin II antagonists and also discloses additional imidazole angiotensin II antagonists useful for treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Some of the additionally-disclosed compounds are orally active. The general disclosure of WO 89/06233 encompasses the compounds of this invention, but the compounds of this invention are not specifically disclosed.PCT Application, International Publication Number WO 91/00277 published January 10, 1991, discloses substitutes imidazoles useful as All blockers . The compounds describes have activity in treating hypertension and congestive heart failure.PCT Application, International Publication Number WO 91/00281 published January 10, 1991, describes fused- ring aryl substituted imidazoles useful as All blockers. The compounds described have activity in treating hypertension and congestive heart failure.European Patent Application Publication Number 0 434 249 A2 published June 26, 1991 describes benzσfuran derivatives useful in treatment or prophylaxis of hypertension and potentially
