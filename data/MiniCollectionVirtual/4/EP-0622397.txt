<CLAIMS>
Claims for the following Contracting States : AT, BE, CH, FR, GB, IT, LI, NL
Aqueous mulsions based on 

a) 100 parts by weight of organopolysiloxanes which 
contain polar groups on Si-C-bonded hydrocarbon radicals, 

with the proviso that methyl or phenyl groups are not to 
be included with the SI-C-bonded hydrocarbon radicals 

which contain polar groups, and 
b) not more than 50 parts by weight of alkyl polyglycosides. 
Emulsions according to Claim 1, in which the 
organopolysiloxanes (a) have the general formula (I) 


R
n
R'
m
SiO
(4-n-m)/2
 
in which 


R
denotes identical or different, optionally substituted 
hydrocarbon radicals or hydrocarbon-oxy 

radicals having in each case 1 to 18 carbon atoms, 
hydrogen atoms or hydroxyl radicals, 
R'
denotes identical or different Si-C-bonded substituted 
hydrocarbon radicals containing polar 

groups, with the proviso that the polar groups are 
not methyl or phenyl groups, 
n
denotes an integer having the value 0, 1, 2 or 3, 
m
denotes an integer having the value 0, 1, 2 or 3 
 
and the sum n+m has an average value of 1.8 to 2.2, and 

m is chosen such that the polyorganosiloxane contains at 
least one radical R'. 
Emulsions according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
polar groups bonded to Si-C-bonded hy
drocarbon radicals 
are amino, ammonium, epoxide, hydroxyl, amido, mercapto, 

carboxyl and/or sulphonic acid groups and esters or salts 
thereof. 
Emulsions according to Claim 1, 2, or 3, which 
additionally comprise cosurfactants. 
Claims for the following Contracting State : DE
Aqueous emulsions based on 

a) 100 parts by weight of organopolysiloxanes which 
contain polar groups on Si-C-bonded hydrocarbon radicals, 

with the proviso that the polar groups are not an amino 
or amido group, and that methyl or phenyl groups are not 

to be included with the Si-C-bonded hydrocarbon radicals 
which contain polar groups, and 
b) not more than 50 parts by weight of alkyl polyglycosides.

n
denotes an integer having the value 0, 1, 2 or 3, 
m
denotes an integer having the value 0, 1, 2 or 3 
 
and the sum n+m has an average value of 1.8 to 2.2, and 

m is chosen such that the polyorganosiloxane contains at 
least one radical R'. 
Emulsions according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
polar groups bonded to Si-C-bonded hydrocarbon radicals 

are ammonium, epoxide, hydroxyl, mercapto, carboxyl 
and/or sulphonic acid groups and esters or salts thereof.  

 
Emulsions according to Claim 1, 2, or 3, which
