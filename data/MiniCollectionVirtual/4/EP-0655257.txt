<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a flexible kink 
resistant introducer system 60 for introducing an 

elongated object into the venous system and especially 
for introducing a cardiac pacemaker lead. The 

introducer system features a sheath 61 having a kink 
resistant section 70 allowing the sheath to be bent in 

that region and still allow a lead to be introduced 
therethrough. The kink resistant section 70 comprises a 

series of bellows or pleats 72,74. The bellows or 
pleats may further be arranged to form a screw about a 

portion of the sheath to thereby permit the sheath to be 
screwed into body tissue. The sheath 61 preferably is 

constructed to readily tear in a longitudinal direction 
and thus permits the system to be removed from the 

venous system without having to withdraw the sheath over 
an end of the pacemaker lead.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an introducer 
system having a kink resistant sheath for the insertion 
of catheters and other instruments into the body and 
more particularly to an introducer system having a kink 
resistant splittable sheath used to introduce pacemaker 
leads into the venous system. Generally speaking, pacing systems include an 
implantable pulse generator, commonly known as a 
pacemaker, electrically connected to the heart by at 
least one transvenous endocardial lead. More 
specifically an endocardial lead provides an electrical 
pathway between the pacemaker, connected to the proximal 
end of the lead, and endocardial tissue, in contact with 
the distal end of the lead. Endocardial tissue refers 
to a specific layer of tissue in the interior of the 
heart's chambers. In such a manner electrical pulses 
emitted by the pacemaker travel through the endocardial 
lead and stimulate the heart. Endocardial leads are often placed in contact with 
the endocardial tissue by passage through a venous 
access, such as the subclavian vein or one of its 
tributaries. In such a manner transvenous endocardial 
leads offer as an advantage that they may be placed into 
contact with the heart without requiring major thoracic 
surgery. Rather, transvenous endocardial leads may be 
introduced into a vein and manoeuvred therefrom into 
contact with the heart.  A multi-step procedure is often used to introduce 
such leads within the venous system. Generally this 
procedure consists of inserting a hollow needle into a 
blood vessel, such as the subclavian vein. A wire guide 
is then passed through the needle into the interior 
portion of the vessel. The needle is then withdrawn and 
an introducer sheath and dilator assembly is then 
inserted over the wire guide into the vessel. The 
assembly is advanced into a suitable position within the 
vessel, i.e. so that the distal end is well within the 
vessel but the proximal end is outside the patient. 
Next the dilator and wire guide are removed. The 
introducer sheath is left in position and therefore 
offers direct access from outside the patient to the 
interior of the blood vessel. In such a fashion a lead 
can be passed into the vessel through the introducer 
sheath and ultimately be positioned within the heart. 
Finally the introducer sheath is removed from the body. 
With respect to pacemaker leads, however, which 
typically have a relatively bulky connector pin assembly 
at the proximal end, the introducer sheath is removed 
from the body by being

<CLAIMS>
An introducer system (60) comprising: 
   a sheath (61) having a first end and a second end, 

the sheath (61) being compatible for insertion within a 
body, the first end configured to insert the sheath (61). 

within the body with the second end extending out of the 
body, the sheath having a central lumen (65) configured 

to permit introduction of at least one lead or catheter 
therethrough; 

   a flexible kink resistant section (70) located 
along the sheath (61); and 

   means (62,63,64) for permitting removal of the 
sheath (61) from the lead or catheter disposed 

therethrough without requiring the sheath (61) to be 
removed from an end of the lead or catheter disposed 

therethrough; 
   characterized in that the sheath (61) has a 

dilator (66) disposed through the central lumen (65) of
