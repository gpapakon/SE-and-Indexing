<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to crystalline propylene 
homopolymers. More particularly, it relates to crystalline 
propylene homopolymers, films and fibers produced therefrom, 
and nonwoven fabric made from said fibers. In a spunbond or staple nonwoven process, spun or carded 
fiber webs usually go through a thermal bonding step to be 
made into fabrics which have integrity and strength needed for 
various applications. In laminate structures where two or 
more layers of nonwoven webs are involved, the thermal bonding 
is a necessary step to put the layers together. In these 
processes an optimum bonding temperature is selected in order 
to achieve acceptable fabric properties. The bonding window, 
a temperature range whereby acceptable bonding is achieved, 
should also be wide enough for the bonding process to be 
practical. In the thermal bonding of single layer spunbond or 
thermally bondable fabrics, the bonding temperature is 
typically set at a temperature at which the maximum fabric 
strength is obtained, also referred to as the optimum bonding 
temperature. For conventional propylene homopolymer resins 
this temperature range is typically from 140°C-150°C for 
spunbond fabrics and from 155°C-165°C for thermally bonded 
fabrics. However, due to the high crystallinity of 
conventional propylene homopolymer resins, the bonding window 
is very narrow. For laminate structures the optimum bonding temperature 
is generally set at a temperature whereby the differences in  
 
bonding characteristics between the different type of layers 
can be balanced, because each layer has different bonding 
characteristics due to the differences in the fiber size or in 
the polymer type used. This difference is intentional since 
each layer is designed to perform different physical property 
requirements. Take for example a laminate structure wherein the outer 
layers are intended for strength and abrasion, and the inner 
layers are for barrier properties. Because of the differences 
in property requirements, the fiber size used for the inner 
layers is usually much smaller than the fiber size used for 
the outer layers. Also, the polymer type used is different in 
order to meet spinning requirements. Because of the differences in the fiber size and the 
polymer type, the inner layer generally requires a lower 
bonding temperature than the outer layer, a difference of from 
10 to 20°C. This creates a problem in selecting an optimum 
bonding temperature for laminate structures. For example, if 
the bonding temperature is
