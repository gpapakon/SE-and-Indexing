<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO FOOTWEARThis invention relates to improvements in or in relation to footwear and refers particularly, although not exclusively, to footwear for sporting use and which includes an ankle support strap. A very common sporting injury is a sprain or tear of the lateral ligament. This usually occurs due to the foot turning in on itself. To reduce strain on the lateral ligament, many sports persons either wear high-cut boots, or tape the ankle prior to the sporting activity. Taping or strapping is very time consuming and expensive by virtue of the amount of tape or strapping involved. High-cut boots are heavy and expensive and many sports persons dislike wearing them as a result. They are also not suited for certain sports such as, for example, soccer, where flexibility is inherently required.It is therefore the principal object of the invention to provide footwear having a built-in ankle support strap system.With the above and other objects in mind, the present invention provides an article or footwear having a sole and an upper, said upper having an opening through which a foot of a user is intended to be placed, an attachment strap extending upwardly adjacent said opening, and an ankle strap attachable to said attachment strap and intended, in use, to be placed around an ankle of said user.In order that the invention may be fully understood, there shall now be described by way of non-limitative example only preferred constructions of items of footwear incorporating the principal features of the present invention, the description being with reference to the accompanying illustrative drawings in which:Figure 1 is a front perspective view of an item of footwear incorporating the principal features of the present invention; 

 Figure 2 is a side view of the footwear of Figure 1 as fitted to a wearer;Figure 3 is a side view in partial cross-section of the footwear of Figure 2; Figure 4 is a view corresponding to Figure 1 in partial section and partially assembled;Figure 5 is a view corresponding to Figure 1 of a second embodiment; andFigure 6 is a view corresponding to Figure 1 of a third embodiment.To refer to Figures 1 to 4, there is shown an item of footwear 10 adapted to be placed over the foot 12 of a wearer. The foot 12 is, in accordance with normal biological function, at the lower end of an ankle 14 of the wearer. The item of footwear 10 has an upper 16 and sole 18. The upper 16 has a tongue 20, laces 22 to close a longitudinal opening 24 over the tongue 20 and a foot
