<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing device for flowing substances, especially food substances, comprises a valve arrangement (2) for controlling flow of substance from a container (3) out through a discharge opening (4). The container (3) is of the type that decreases its volume at the same rate as with which the substance is discharged from the container in order to avoid that the substance in the container there gets in contact with air. Between the valve arrangement (2) and the container (3) a conduit (6) is extended, which is co-ordinated with a pump arrangement (7) arranged to transport the substance in the conduit without getting in direct contact with the substance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a dispensing device for flowing 
substances according to the precharacterizing part of enclosed 
claim 1. The flowing substances primarily in view are flowing 
food substances, such as mustard, ketchup, dressings and so 
on within the restaurant and kiosk business, cream, butter 
creams, jams and so on within the bakery business etc.  
 The handling now used for food products of additive character for the 
food industry, e.g. bakeries etc., and the restaurant business is affected 
by several deficiencies. Thus, it is today usual that the containers containing 
the food product in question are located in room temperature for 
hours, days not to mention weeks before the content of the containers 
has been consumed. Furthermore, such considerable lengths of time also 
often pass between thorough cleaning of the containers and the dispensing 
devices used. Such extended dwell times of food products in room 
temperature give rise to a rapid increase of micro organisms harmful to 
humans. This is especially the case as the food substances in question 
often are in contact with the surrounding air. According to known art it is 
namely required, to even get the food substance out of actual containers 
with the dispensing devices used, that vent openings are present between 
the interior of the containers and the surrounding since the discharging 
of substance out of the containers otherwise would be counteracted 
by the tendency of forming of vacuum therein, which arises at the 
discharging of substance. It is true that attempts are made to reduce this 
increase by admixing considerable quantities of pesticides active against 
the micro organisms in question to the food products involved. However, 
it is today a nearly unanimous opinion within the staff of medical researchers 
within this field that such pesticides are considerably more 
harmful to the human organism than expected before. Once the content 
of pesticides is reduced or such means are totally eliminated, an even 
more rapid increase of micro organisms is created.  
 The precharacterizing part of claim 1 corresponds, for example, 
to US-A-4 515 294. Although the device according to the US 
patent comprises a valve arrangement for controlling flow of 
substances from the container out through a discharge opening, 
the device suffers from the disadvantage that it does not have 
any pump arrangement for transporting the substance. For the 
rest, the container of this US patent is of the type that decreases 
in volume at
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A dispensing device (1) for flowing substances, especially food 
substances, comprising a tube (5) of flexible material adapted 

to receive the substance in question from a container (3), and a 
valve arrangement (2) for controlling flow of substance from the 

container (3) out through a discharge opening (4), a conduit (6) 
extending between the container (3) and the tube (5),
characterized
 in that a pump arrangement (7) is arranged to 
transport the substance from the container to the tube via the 

conduit, in that between the tube and the pump arrangement a 
pressure sensor (10) is co-ordinated with the conduit, which 

sensor (10) interrupts the pump arrangement (7) when a certain 
pressure level is reached and starts the pump arrangement (7) 

when the pressure falls below a certain pressure level, and in that 
the valve arrangement (2) is arranged to close against flow of 

substance from the tube (5) when no external pressure is applied 
to the tube (5) but to open when external pressure above 

a certain threshold value is applied to the tube (5). 
A device according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the pressure sensor (10) is arranged to 
be affected by width changes of the conduit (6) depending on 

the pressure in the conduit. 
A device according to any of the claims 1-2,
characterized
 in that the conduit (6) is in one single piece of 
material all the way from the container (3) to the valve arrangement 

(2) or the tube (5). 
A device according to any of the claims 1-3,
characterized
 in that the conduit (6), at its end (27) adapted for 
connection to the container, presents a cutting means (29, 38) 

arranged to cut through a sealing (30) arranged on the container.  
 
A device according to any of claims 1-4,
characterized
 in that the container (3) is of the type that decreases 
its volume at the same rate as the substance is discharged 

from the container in order to avoid that the substance 
in the container there gets in conctact with air. 
A device according to claim 5,
characterized
 in that the container has the character of a flexible 
bag. 
A device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the pump arrangement (7) is arranged to 
transport the substance in the conduit without getting in direct 

contact with the substance. 
A device according to claim 7,
characterized
 in that the conduit (6), along at least a part of its 
length, is designed like a hose and that the hose forms part of 

the pump arrangement (7) as the latter comprises pump means 
(18) which are arranged to be moved along a portion of the 

hose while pressing against it. 
A device according to claim 8,
characterized
 in that the hose portion extends in the form of an 
arc and that the pump means (18) are rotationally arranged.
