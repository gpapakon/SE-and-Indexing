<ABSTRACT>
A coupling assembly includes a receiving tubular 
member (13) defining an opening (27) for receiving a first 

tubular member (12). The receiving tubular member has an 
inner portion defining an inner bore dimensioned to receive 

one end (68) of the first member, and an outer portion 
defining an internal annular cavity (22) intersecting the 

inner bore and projecting radially outwardly therefrom. 
The annular cavity (22) comprises an annular tapered wall 

portion (25) tapered radially inwardly and projecting 
longitudinally toward the opening (27), and a split lock 

ring (72) formed from spring material and disposed in the 
annular cavity between the first tubular member (12) and 

the receiving tubular member (13). The lock ring (72) has 
an outer circumferential surface portion adapted to engage 

the tapered wall portion (25), and an inner circumferential 
surface portion (73) adapted to engage an external wall 

portion of the first tubular member (12). The lock ring 
(72) is adapted to expand circumferentially into the annular 

cavity (22) during insertion of said first tubular 
member into the receiving tubular member, and to be compressed 

between the tapered wall portion and the external 
wall portion in response to relative longitudinal separating 

movement between the first tubular member and the 
receiving tubular member. The inner circumferential surface 

portion (73) of the lock ring defines first and second 
substantially parallel, spaced apart, circumferentially 

extending knife edges (76, 81). Also included is an annular 
sealing member (36) disposed in the annular cavity 

between the lock ring and the inner bore, the sealing 
member being dimensioned to be engaged between the first 

tubular member and the receiving tubular member. Under 
high pressure conditions both of the knife edges (76, 81) 

penetrate the external wall portion so as to prevent longitudinal 
movement of the first tubular member relative to 

the receiving tubular member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to an improved pipe
coupling assembly and, more particularly, to an easily
assembled and disassembled pipe coupling assembly.Known methods for connecting a length of metal pipe
or tubing to valves or pipe fittings such as elbows and tees
include the use of threaded connectors, soldering, compression
fitting, flaring and welding. Non-metallic pipe, such as
thermoplastic pipe, may also be joined by adhesives.These methods are all subject to various drawbacks.
Methods calling for the application of heat or force can
be awkward and time consuming to practice in cramped and
inaccessible areas, for example, areas in which residential
plumbing is typically located. Soldering, welding and the
like require the attention of a skilled worker using special
tools to produce a good connection. Moreover, it is often
difficult and time consuming to disconnect a length of pipe
from a fitting once they have been joined, and it is often
not possible to disassemble the joint without damaging the
pipe or the fitting to such an extent that they cannot later
be rejoined.Acceptable pipe joints are more difficult to make
when the pipe is to carry a fluid under pressure. Even
where threaded pipe and threaded connectors are used, greater
skill is required to produce a strong and leakproof seal
which will withstand the pressure rating of the pipe being
joined. For proper sealing under pressure, washers or O-rings 
are often included in the joint. If the washer and pipe are
made of dissimilar metals, they will sometimes undergo
electrolysis in the presence of moisture in the joint or
water and chemical agents flowing through the pipe.
Electrolytic action leads to degradation of the washer, which
can eventually cause the joint to leak and loosen the locking
action of lock washers.Some of the aforementioned drawbacks are overcome
by the use of plastic pipe joined by adhesive. But plastic
pipe is difficult to connect directly to metal valve fittings
without special adaptors. Moreover, once sealed with adhesive,
prior plastic pipe joints cannot be readily undone. Disclosed
in our EP-A-0 588 596, published on 23.03.1994, (US Appln. No. 07/944,373) is an
improved coupling assembly that is illustrated in Figs. 1-9 of the accompanying drawings.
A pipe coupling assembly 11 includes an inner first tubular
member 12 and an outer receiving tubular member 13. The
tubular member 12 generally will be a length of pipe or
tubing such as commonly employed for the delivery of fluids.
