<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an illegal view/copy
protection method and apparatus for a digital broadcasting
system, in which digital broadcasting performed through
broadcasting media such as cable, satellite and terrestrial
broadcasting, or through prerecorded media such as video
cassette tapes, is prevented from being illegally viewed or
copied to thereby protect its copyright.For conventional systems for copyright protection on
digital media, there are Macrovision's intellectual property
protection system (IPPS), which is disclosed in US Patent No.
5,315,448, and the integrated receiver/decoder (IRD), a
conditional receiving system for digital broadcasting media,
for receiving DirecTV's satellite broadcasting currently
transmitted in the US.The Macrovision's IPPS disclosed in US Patent No.
5,315,448 is a copy protection system for a hybrid digital VCR
having digital recording functions for both a digital input
signal and an analog input signal.As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, in operating its copy 
protection function, Macrovision's IPPS detects, when a
digital signal is input, copy protection control bits from an
input signal, and when an analog signal is input, detects the
analog copy protection waveform from the input signal.More specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, a signal in which
the analog copy protection waveform generated from an analog
copy protection generator is added to the analog video output
of the output signals of the digital VCR is output and
displayed to be normal on an analog TV but distorted on an
analog VCR, as shown in Fig. 1. In digital recording of the
input signal, the copy protection control bits are changed to
prevent digital copy or to permit one-time digital copy.Referring to Fig. 3, the IPPS comprises an analog copy
protection detector (ACP) 2 for detecting the analog copy
protection waveform from an input analog NTSC video signal 1,
an A/D converter 3 for A/D-converting analog NTSC video signal
1 input according to the signal output from the ACP detector,
an AC bit detector 5 for detecting the AC bit from input
digital video signal 4, an SCPS bit detector 6 for detecting
the SCPS from input digital video signal 4, an AC bit adder 7
for adding the AC bit to input digital video signal 4
according to the SCPS bit output from SCPS bit detector 6, a
switch 8 for outputting a signal output from AC bit adder 7
according to the AC bit output from AC bit detector 5, a 
switch 9 for selecting and outputting the signal output from
A/D converter 3 and switch 8, a digital tape deck
mech
