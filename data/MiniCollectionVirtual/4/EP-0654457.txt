<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a method for manufacturing organic fertilizers 
by kneading and cutting a mixture of livestock excrements 

with cellulose-containing organic materials, followed 
by pulverizing the treated mixture while contacting it with 

air. The method is characterized in that said mixture is 
adjusted to a moisture content of 25 to 75 weight % before 

kneading and cutting, that said kneading and cutting is 
carried out until the temperature of the mixture rises up to 

40 to 90°C, and that there is added a pH adjusting agent by 
which the pH value during the fermentation of microorganisms 

is in the range of 6 to 9 for activating and propagating 
thermophilic microoganisms and aerobic microorganisms as well 

as for decreasing psychrophilic microorganisms and anaerobic 
microorganisms. The method leads to composts of good quality 

and without a bad odor within a short time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing 
organic fertilizers by artificial treatments of livestock 
excrements, such as chicken or cattle manures, with 
cellulose-containing organic materials such as grasses, 
hulls, straws, wood chips, etc. into organic fertilizers 
within a short time. An enormous quantity of excrements exhausted from the large-scale 
livestock industry are left as such due to lack of 
appropriate treating methods, and environmental pollution 
caused by bad odor and discharge thereof without treatment 
have created a social problem. In general, it requires 5 to 6 months to compost excrements 
of chicken, cattle, swine, etc., and cellulose-containing 
coarse organic materials used as beds thereof, such as 
grasses, straws, hulls, wood chips, etc., by leaving them as 
such in the nature. This is very inefficient and generates 
bad odor during that period. It has also been difficult to 
obtain evenly-fermented compost of good quality because of 
unevenness in fermentation between the surface and interior 
parts. From WO-80/01803 there was known a process for the production 
of nutrient material wherein animal manure is mixed with 
paper shreds or cellulose fibres, followed by mincing and 
cutting the mixture, whereby it is heated by friction. Thereafter 
the mixture is comminuted. There is no teaching in this 
document that the moisture content of said mixture is of any 
importance and must be controlled. In EP-A-0286758 there is described a screw mill which is 
used, for example, for producing calcium carbonate powder as 
a bulking agent for paper. The mill is provided with a cylindrical  
 
member wherein a screw is rotating. The material 
filled into the cylinder is pressed and passed forward by the 
screw within the cylinder at the end of which said material 
is ground into a fine powder between multi-stage vanes. The 
document does not mention the use of a second cylinder which 
might be provided for a specific purpose. EP-A-0279076 discloses a device for mincing organic waste 
material, provided with at least two screws within one chamber. 
One of these screws has at least one mincing tool. The object of the present invention is a method for manufacturing 
composts of good quality within a short time. This above object is met by a method for manufacturing 
organic fertilizers by kneading and cutting a mixture of 
livestock excrements with cellulose-containing organic 
materials under an elevated pressure, wherein the temperature 
of said mixture rises by the

Method for manufacturing of organic fertilizers by kneading 
and cutting a mixture of livestock excrements with 

cellulose-containing organic materials under an elevated 
pressure, wherein the temperature of said mixture rises 

by the elevated pressure and by friction, followed by 
pulverizing the thus treated mixture while contacting it 

with air, characterized in that said mixture of livestock 
excrements with cellulose-containing organic materials is 

adjusted to a moisture content of 25 to 75 weight % 
before kneading and cutting the mixture, that said kneading 

and cutting is carried out until the temperature of 
the mixture treated rises up to 40 to 90°C, and that 

there is added a pH adjusting agent to the mixture consisting 
of livestock excrements and cellulose-containing 

materials, simultaneously with the adjusting of the moisture 
content of said mixture, by which pH adjusting agent 

the pH value during the fermentation of microorganisms is 
in the range of 6 to 9 for activating and propagating 

thermophilic microoganisms and aerobic microorganisms as 
well as for decreasing psychrophilic microorganisms and 

anaerobic microorganisms. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that by the 
pH adjusting agent the pH value during the fermentation 

of microorganisms is in the range of 7 to 8.
