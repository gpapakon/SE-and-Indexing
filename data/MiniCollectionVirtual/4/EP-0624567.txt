2
-phenyl.
A compound as claimed in claim 1, wherein R
1

CH
2

A compound of the formula (I), wherein R
3
 is CH
2
-phenyl.
A compound of the formula (I) as claimed in claim
1 from the group comprising 2-benzyloxy-6-fluorobenzamide,

2-benzyloxy-6-fluoroaniline, 2-benzyloxy-6-fluoro-N-benzyloxycarbonylaniline
and

2-benzyloxy-6-fluorobenzonitrile.
A process for preparing compounds of the formula 
(I) as claimed in claim 1, in which R
1
 has the
meaning as claimed in claim 1 and R
2
 is -NH
2
 or
-NHCOOR
3
, wherein compounds of the formula (II)


in which X is OR
1
, are reacted, in aqueous-alkaline
medium, with chlorine, bromine, sodium

hypochlorite or sodium hypobromite in the presence
of alcohols and at temperatures of from -15°C to

+80°C, in the sense of a Hofmann degradation.
The process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the
reaction is effected in the presence of an

alcohol, HOR
3
, where R
3
 has the same meaning as in
claim 1.
The process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the
compound of the formula (I')



resulting therefrom is either isolated, or the
carbamate group and/or, for X = OR
1
, the group OR
1

is cleaved hydrogenolytically or hydrolytically.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 5
to 7, wherein 2,6-difluorobenzonitrile is used as

the starting compound for preparing the compounds
(II) and the nitrile group is converted, in a

manner known per se, into the amide group, and, in
the case of compounds in which X is OR
1

corresponding F atom is replaced by the OR
1
 group
before, during or after this conversion. 
The process as claimed in claim 8, wherein the
replacement of the fluorine atom by a benzyloxy

group is effected at the same time as the
conversion of the nitrile group into the amide

group in such a way that the 2,6-difluorobenzonitrile
is converted, in the presence

of an alcohol, HOR
3
, where R
3
 has the same meaning
as in claim 1 and preferably represents a benzyl

radical, into the corresponding benzamide, and the
OR
1
 group (here R
1
 is different from hydrogen) is
subsequently, where appropriate, cleaved

hydrogenolytically.

2,6-difluorobenzonitrile for preparing the

compound of the formula (I) having R
2
 = CN is
reacted with an alcohol, HOR

the same meaning as in claim 1, in aqueous-alkaline

medium or in a dipolar, aprotic solvent
in the presence of alkalis.
A process for preparing the compounds of the

2

NH2, wherein either 2,6-difluorobenzonitrile or

2,6-difluorobenzamide is reacted, in aqueous-alkaline
medium, with alcohols to form compounds

of the formula II having X = OR

are then, after intermediate isolation, but

preferably without any intermediate isolation,
reacted, in a one-pot process, with chlorine,

bromine, sodium hypochlorite or sodium
hypobromite, at temperatures of from -15°C to +80°C

and in the presence of alcohols, in the sense of a
Hofmann degradation, and, where appropriate,

carbamates which have been formed are subsequently
cleaved hydrolytically or hydrogenolytically.
The process as claimed in claim 11, wherein 
phenylmethanols, where the alkyl radical or the

phenyl radical can be substituted by one to three

the alcohol is benzyl alcohol.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims
11 to 13, wherein the reactions to form the
