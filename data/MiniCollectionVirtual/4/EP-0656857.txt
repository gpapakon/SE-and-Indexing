<ABSTRACT>
A closure unit consists of a pouring part (10) and of a closure part (20) linked to the pouring-part even in the open state. In the closed state of the closure unit, both parts are sealed with respect to each other by a pair of sealing surfaces. The closure unit has an area made of a pouring-part material (A) and an area made of a closing-part material (B). Both areas are joined together by a joint line. The path of the joint line through the closure unit is such that at least parts of the sealing surface at the side of the pouring-part are made of the pouring-part material and at least parts of the sealing surface at the side of the closure part are made of the closure-part material. The closure unit is produced by a simultaneous casting process. The materials are matched and the casting parameters of both simultaneous casting processes are set in such a way that both materials meet at the position of the future joint line and form a joint line (31). The position and form of the joint line may further be determined by movable casting mould parts (slides).
