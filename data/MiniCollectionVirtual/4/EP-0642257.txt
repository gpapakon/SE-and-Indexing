<ABSTRACT>
A pulsed imaging Raster Output Scanner (80) utilizes pulse width 
modulation in 

conjunction with asymmetric spatial filtering (136) to prevent 
overshoot of the intensity and 

maintain precise intensity levels into the other exposure levels. 
In one embodiment tri-level exposures are created.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a pulsed imaging, non-facet tracked, pulse width
modulation Raster Output Scan (ROS) system for creating tri-level exposures at a recording
medium such as images at a photosensitive surface, and, more specifically, for asymmetric spatial
filtering in the ROS system.In tri-level, highlight color imaging, unlike conventional xerography, upon exposure, three
charge levels are produced on the charge-retentive surface. The highly charged (i.e. unexposed)
areas are developed with toner of one color, and the area more fully discharged is also developed,
but with a toner of a different color. Thus, the charge retentive surface contains three exposure
levels; zero exposure, intermediate exposure, and full exposure, which correspond to three charge
levels. These three levels can be developed to print, for example, black, white, and a single color.There are several scanning techniques known in the prior art to obtain the tri-level
exposure imaging. A conventional flying spot scanner uses a ROS unit to "write" an exposed
image on a photoreceptive surface a pixel at a time. To obtain higher spatial resolution, a pulse
imaging scanner can be utilized. A preferred technique, capable of higher spatial resolution is to
use similar optical elements as the flying spot scanner (rotating polygon, laser light source, pre
polygon and post polygon optics), but with an A/O modulator which illuminates many pixels at a
given time, resulting in a scanner with a coherent imaging response. With this type of scan system,
the exposure level, or levels at the image surface, can be controlled by controlling the drive level of
the A/O modulator dependent on the video data. In a tri-level system, two drive levels are used, one
for the white exposure and a second higher drive level for the DAD or color exposure. One such
system is described in EP-A-0 533 346.EP-A-0 533 346 discloses a raster output scanner in which pulse width modulation and
spatial filtering are used to form three exposure levels at the surface of a recording medium. The
scanner includes a light source, an acousto-optic modulator, a polygon scanner, and Fourier
transform means. The modulator modulates a high intensity beam generated by the light source in
response to pulse width modulated signals. The scanner has a scanning element having a plurality of facets and scans the
modulated beam across the recording medium. The Fourier transform means transforms the beam
and spatial filters it to limit the transmission to predetermined
