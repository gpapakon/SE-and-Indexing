<ABSTRACT>
A drilling device for making undercut holes is proposed in which a drill (4) is pivotably mounted in a drilling spindle (3) designed as a hollow spindle. A drill holder (23) can be pivoted about a pivot axis (24) by means of a sliding sleeve (11) enclosing the drilling spindle (3).

Drilling device for producing drilled holes with an 
undercut, in particular in facing panels of stone, ceramics, 

concrete or similar material, having a drive device (2) for 
the rotating drive of a drilling shaft (3) in the form of a 

hollow shaft in which a drill bit holder (23, 38) lies, the 
drill bit holder being received in the drilling shaft (3) so 

as to be laterally displaceable and in which a drill bit (4) 
is inserted, having a raising device (1, 6-10, 13), with 

which the drilling shaft (3), to produce an advancing 
movement, is displaceable in an axial direction towards the 

facing panel (16), having a depth stop (14) which holds the 
drilling shaft (3) back when a preset drilled hole depth has 

been reached, and having a sliding sleeve (11) surrounding 
the drilling shaft (3), which sliding sleeve is axially 

displaceable with respect to the drilling shaft (3) and to 
which is connected a displacement element (21; 39) which 

acts on a control face (22; 41, 42) or similar means of the 
drill bit holder (23; 38) and displaces the latter laterally 

with respect to the drilling shaft (3) on axial displacement 
of the sliding sleeve (11) with the displacement element 

(21; 39), characterized in that the drill bit (4) has 
laterally projecting cutting edges (25) at the drilling 

head, the sliding sleeve (11) is locked by means of a 
locking device (9, 18) with the raising device (1, 6-10, 13) 

and the depth stop (14, 19) releases the locking device (9, 
18) when a preset displacement is achieved. 
A drilling device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the drill bit holder (23, 38) is arranged to swivel 

about a swivel axis (24) arranged transversely in the 
drilling shaft (3).  

 
A drilling device according to one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that a slot (22) in the drill bit holder 

(23, 38) is provided as control cam, the longitudinal 
direction of which slot runs at an acute angle to the centre 

line of drilling (5), and in which a sliding block (20) 
engages as displacement element (21). 
A drilling device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the drill bit holder (23, 38) is mounted in the 

drilling shaft (3) so as to be displaceable radially and 
parallel with respect to the axis of the drilling shaft (3), 

and a slider (39) with inclined control edges (41, 42), 
which is axially displaceable in the drilling shaft (3), 

acts as the displacement element (21) on the drill bit 
holder (23, 38). 
A drilling device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the sliding sleeve (11) bears axially 

on the drilling shaft (3) by way of a spring element (17) 
and by way of an element (13) joined to the drilling shaft 

(3), that the sliding sleeve (11) is axially displaceable by 
means of an operating lever (7), and that a depth stop (14) 

limiting the depth of the drilled hole projects from the 
drilling shaft (3). 
A drilling device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the locking device comprises a tilting 

lever (9, 18) which is mounted on a base plate (6) of the 
raising device (1) and which engages a holder (1) holding 

the sliding sleeve (11) and moves this with it against a 
spring force to produce an undercut, and on completion of 

the undercut disengages and releases the holder (10) of the 
sliding sleeve (11). 
A drilling device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a lock (33) against raising is  

 
provided, which, for performing the drilling and the 

undercutting, does not allow a return movement until the 
required drilled hole depth has been reached and the 

undercut has been fully formed.
