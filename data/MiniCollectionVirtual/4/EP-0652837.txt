<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steering system 
for the rear wheels of a wheeled vehicle having front 
and rear wheels. "Four wheel" steer has been known previously and 
one such system is described in the patent 
specification of International publication 
No. W0-A-90/14980 of the applicant, which will be 
extensively referred to hereinafter. The steering system of W0-A-90/14980 uses a 
processor to compare desired steering (as sensed by a 
sensor connected directly or indirectly to a steering 
wheel) with the actual steering of the vehicle 
(determined using a yaw gyrometer or lateral 
accelerometer). The steer angle of the rear wheels is 
controlled as a function of the error between the 
desired and actual vehicle turning. The system described in W0-A-90/14980 has been found 
not to cope well with oversteer slide conditions. In a 
normal vehicle when a vehicle starts to slide due to 
oversteer, the driver can apply "reverse lock" (i.e. 
steering in the opposite sense to the sense of the 
steering on commencement of the slide) to correct the 
slide. It has been found that the closed loop steering 
system previously described in W0-A-90/14980 produces 
undesirable effects in an oversteer slide when "reverse 
lock" is applied. During an oversteer slide the rear tyres lose 
considerable grip and it is difficult to generate 
correcting forces during the slide by using the rear  
 
wheels. This situation changes dramatically at the end 
of the slide, when the rear wheels regain full grip. 
With the high bandwidth control system of W0-A-90/14980 
the rear wheels move rapidly to full lock when the 
"reverse lock" is applied to the steering wheel by the 
driver. Therefore the wheels are in an undesirable 
position on recovery. Furthermore, as the reverse 
lock is taken off by the driver, the rear wheels tend 
to move from one lock to the other quickly. This 
action of the rear wheels during the oversteer 
condition and return to normal conditions leads to 
unstable and undesired vehicle motion. The Patent Abstract of Japan to JP-A-62137275 (the features of which 
correspond to the preamble of claim 1) 
describes a steering system for the rear wheels of a 
vehicle which comprises: an actuator for steering the 
rear wheels; sensor means for sensing the lateral speed 
of the vehicle, the longitudinal speed of the vehicle 
and a front wheel steering angle; a control system for 
controlling a ratio of rear wheel steering angle to 
front wheel steering angle which comprises a processor 
which processes the
