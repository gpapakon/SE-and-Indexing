<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a switching power supply
unit having a main switching element and a single or a
plurality of auxiliary switching elements which perform ON/OFF
operations in synchronism with or opposite to ON/OFF operations
of the main switching element.In general, in electronic equipment such as electronic
calculators and communication devices, a switching power supply
unit has been widely used for supplying a stabilized DC voltage
from a commercial AC power supply. As the switching power
supply unit, there are provided switching power supply units
having different circuit systems, such as a forward converter,
or a fly-back converter, in which a main switching element,
which is connected in series to a primary winding of a
transformer, is repeatedly turned on/off to intermittently
apply an input voltage to the transformer so as to obtain a DC
output through a rectifying and smoothing circuit connected to
a secondary winding of the transformer. In contrast with these
switching power supply units, there are provided various kinds
of switching power supply units, in which improvement in
circuit characteristics can be achieved by adding a circuit
which includes an auxiliary switching element for performing
ON/OFF operations in synchronism with ON/OFF operations of a
main switching element or in reverse thereto.A description will be given of a structure of a
conventional switching power supply unit having such an
auxiliary switching element referring to the drawings.First, the conventional art disclosed in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 8-317647 will be illustrated
with reference to Fig. 13.In this figure, reference numeral 50 represents a 
switching power supply unit, which has a partial-resonance
converter circuit 51 and a drive circuit 52. Of these
components, the partial-resonance converter circuit 51 is
composed of capacitors C51, C52, C53, and C54, diodes D51, D52,
and D53, a transformer T51, a main switching element S51, and
an auxiliary switching element S52.In addition, the drive circuit 52 is composed of an output
control circuit 53, comparators 54 and 55, an inverter 56, an
isolation circuit 57, a triangle-wave oscillator 58, a light-emitting
element Pa of a photo coupler, a light-receiving
element Pb of the photo coupler, a transistor Q51, and
resistors R51, R52, and R53.In the switching power supply unit having the above-described
structure, the auxiliary switching element S52
performs ON/OFF operations opposite to the ON/OFF operations of
the main switching element
