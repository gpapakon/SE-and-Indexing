<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing powdery α-alumina comprising single-crystal α-alumina grains, which comprises firing transition 
alumina and/or an alumina source material which yields transition alumina upon heat treatment in an atmospheric gas containing 

at least 1 vol.% of hydrogen chloride or one containing both of at least 1 vol.% of chlorine and 0.1 vol.% of steam at 600 °C or 
above, preferably from 600 °C to 1,400 °C, still preferably from 800 °C to 1,200 °C. Examples of the usable alumina source material 

include aluminum hydroxide, alum and aluminum sulfate. This process can provide powdery α-alumina comprising single-crystal 
α-alumina grains which are highly pure, fine and homogeneous, have a narrow grain size distribution, are not aggregated, 

and form an at least eight-sided polyhedron from various alumina source materials which are mutually different in kind, purity, 
form, grain size and composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing
α-alumina. α-Alumina powder has been widely used as an
abrasive, a raw material for sintered products, a plasma
spraying material, a filler and the like. The α-alumina
produced by the process of the present invention comprises
α-alumina single crystal particles which are not agglomerated
particles and have a narrow particle size distribution, and
is suitable as an abrasive, a raw material for sintered
products, a plasma spraying material, a filler, a raw
material for single crystals, a raw material for a carrier
for catalysts, a raw material for fluorescent substances, a
raw material for encapsulations, a raw material for ceramic
filters, etc.α-Alumina powder obtained by conventional processes
comprises irregular-shaped polycrystals, contains many
agglomerated particles, and has a broad particle size
distribution. For some uses, the purity of conventional
α-alumina powder is insufficient. In order to overcome these
problems, α-alumina powder produced by special processes as
hereinafter described has been employed for specific uses. 
However, these special processes still fail to arbitrarily
control the shape or particle diameter of α-alumina. It has
thus been difficult to obtain α-alumina powder having a
narrow particle size distribution.Known special processes for producing α-alumina
powder include a process utilizing a hydrothermal reaction of
aluminum hydroxide (hereinafter referred to as hydrothermal
treatment process); a process comprising adding a flux to
aluminum oxide, fusing, and precipitating (hereinafter
referred to as flux process); and a process in which aluminum
hydroxide is calcined in the presence of a mineralizer.With respect to a hydrothermal treatment process,
JP-B-57-22886 (the term "JP-B" as used herein means an
"examined published Japanese patent application") discloses a
process in which corundum is added as a seed crystal to
control the particle size. The process consists of synthesis
in a high temperature under a high pressure, making the
resulting α-alumina powder expensive.According to the study by Matsui, et al.
(Hydrothermal Hannou (Hydrothermal Reactions), Vol. 2, pp.
71-78 "Growth of Alumina Single Crystal by Hydrothermal
Method"), an α-alumina single crystal obtained by
hydrothermal growth of an alumina single crystal containing
chromium on a sapphire (α-alumina) seed crystal contains
cracks. On examining the homogeneity of the crystal in an
attempt to clarify the cause of the cracks, it was confirmed 
that a high strain
