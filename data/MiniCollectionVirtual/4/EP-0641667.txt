<ABSTRACT>
A recording apparatus comprises a head (1) for forming 
an image on a recording medium or for reading an image 

formed on a recording medium; a supporting member for 
holding the head; a first unit (202c) for electrical connection 

provided for the head; a second unit (204a) for electrical 
connection provided for the supporting member, 

which can be electrically connected to the first unit 
for electrical connection; and a member (204d) for deelectrifying 

static electricity, which is provided for the 
supporting member in the vicinity of the second unit 

for electrical connection. This deelectrifying member 
prevents static electricity from flowing into the 

signal lines provided for the second unit for electrical 
connection when the supporting member is actuated 

to hold the head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
apparatus which uses a recording head for forming an
image on a recording medium or a reading head for
reading an image formed on a recording medium.There has been a problem that a recording head, a
reading head, or an electric circuit in the main body
of the apparatus is damaged due to the static
electricity accumulated on the hand of an operator when
the operator places his hand on or touches the
recording head, the reading head, or the vicinity
thereof. There has also been a problem of the same
kind due to the static electricity accumulated on a
part of the operator's body or on the aforesaid head
when the operator attaches or detaches the recording
head or reading head to or from a supporting member
which holds the head.For example, an exchangeable recording head
integrally formed with an ink tank for a recording
apparatus of an ink jet type often exposes the portion
where the recording head is coupled with the signal
lines drawn from the main body of the apparatus on the
occasion that such recording heads are to be exchanged. 
Despite the existence of this exposed coupling portion,
the operator's hand inevitably approaches this portion
when the recording heads are exchanged. As means for
preventing this, there has been often provided a cover
over this coupling portion so that the operator's hand
does not touch the portion to be exposed for coupling.However, the provision of this cover results in
the increased number of parts, and disadvantageously
raises the cost. In addition, although the number of
parts does not increase considerably if the cover is
structured so that it can be simply fixed, such a fixed
type cover should be provided with the so-called
shutter arrangement so that while the exposed portion
is covered when the head is removed, the external cover
member can be retracted in order to execute the
required coupling when the head is mounted. In this
case, the number of parts inevitably increases more,
and the structure becomes more complicated. This is
disadvantageous not only in coastwise, but also, in the
maintenance of a good quality of the product.Examples of the above types of solution to the
problem of static electricity discharge are provided in
EP A 0,372,997 and in IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin
(Vol. 28, No. 7, pages 2799-2800, December 1985). Both
these documents disclose a recording head secured to a
carriage. In order to discharge to ground the possible
static energy accumulated in the recording head and in 
the carriage, the
