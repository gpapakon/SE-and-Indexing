<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide a suction/filtration apparatus which is extremely simple 
in construction because an extremely simple principle is utilized, has rather higher performance as a filter than 

conventional apparatuses, and can drastically improve various air pollution problems which are being posed at present. 
A liquid filter agent (2) is stored in a sealed container (1) in such a manner as to leave an upper space (3), a gas inlet 

pipe (4) for introducing a gas to be filtrated into the filter agent (2) is disposed in such a manner that the front end of 
the pipe (4) is positioned outside the container and the rear end of the pipe is immersed in the filter agent (2). A gas 

outlet pipe or gas suction means (5) for applying a suction force to the upper space (3) of the container (1) is allowed 
to communicate with the space so as to constitute a liquid filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a suction filtration 
apparatus by which the outside gas is sucked and then passed 
through liquid filter(s) in the apparatus for removal of heat of 
the gas or specific gas components, microorganisms or fine 
particulate solids contained in the gas. Heretofore, there have been known various apparatuses called 
filtration apparatuses, removal apparatuses and suction 
apparatuses by which specific gas components contained in gas 
(air) are recovered by adsorption or microorganisms and fine 
particulate solids contained in gas are adsorbed and then removed 
using a down-washing shower and the like. However, the conventional filtration and adsorption 
apparatuses are structurally complex and should be applied 
special principles or techniques to their filtration and 
adsorption mechanism. As an inevitable consequence, such 
apparatuses themselves are expensive "chemical apparatuses", 
resulting in an economical defect. In particular, as for apparatuses suitable for removal of 
MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) which causes 
so-called "hospital infection" and pollen of Sugi (Japanese 
cedar) which causes so-called "pollen disease", both which are 
recent problems, or apparatuses suitable for removal of floating  
 
agricultural chemicals which cause so-called "House disease" 
which is a problem for persons engaged in vegetable culture in a 
vinyl house, or apparatuses suitable for removal of puzzolana or 
sand and dust in desert, any useful one has not been provided 
yet. Accordingly, the problem to be solved by the present 
invention is to provide a suction filtration apparatus which can 
be constructed very simply due to its extremely simple principle 
and, furthermore, which can exhibit more excellent filtering 
property particularly in removal of substances which may cause 
such various kinds of air pollution as described above, which 
being current problems, than the conventional apparatuses in 
spite of its simple structure. The suction filtration apparatus of the present invention, 
which has been made for the purpose of solving the problems 
described above, is characterized in that a liquid filter medium 
is contained in a closed container with an upper space maintained 
within the container; a gas intake conduit pipe for introduction 
of gas to be filtered into said filter medium is mounted so that 
its front is positioned outside of said container and its end is 
put into said filter medium; and a gas take-off conduit pipe or a 
gas suction means
