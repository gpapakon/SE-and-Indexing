<ABSTRACT>
A dual-port data cache is provided having one port 
dedicated to servicing a local processor and a second port 

dedicated to servicing a system. The dual-port data cache 
is also capable of a high speed transfer of a line or lines 

of entries by placing the dual-port data cache in "burst 
mode." Burst mode may be utilized with either a read or a 

write operation. An initial address is latched internally, 
and a word line in the memory array is activated during the 

entire data transfer. A control circuit is utilized to 
cycle through and access a number of column addresses 

without having to provide a separate address for each 
operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to computer 
systems, and more particularly to cache memory systems. 
Still more particularly, the present invention relates to 
data cache memory arrays. Cache memories are used in many computer systems to 
improve system performance. A cache memory is a relatively 
small, fast memory which resides between a central 
processor and main system memory. Whenever the processor 
reads the contents of a memory location which is stored in 
the cache memory, the time required to access such location 
is drastically reduced. A good cache technique can provide 
a "hit ratio" of well over ninety percent, meaning that no 
main memory access is necessary for over ninety percent of 
the read operations performed. Access of data which is 
stored in the cache memory can improve access times by 
factors of three to ten times. A cache performs functions requiring two different 
types of memory. The first type is the tag memory, or tag 
RAM, which is used to determine which memory locations are 
actually stored in the cache memory. The second type of 
memory is the data cache memory, in which the data is 
actually stored. In general, the cache tag RAM contains a 
plurality of entries corresponding to the entries of the 
data cache. Each entry is indexed by some number of least 
significant bits of the address generated by the central 
processor, with the tag entry itself containing the most 
significant bits of the memory location which is stored in 
the corresponding data cache entry. If the most  
 
significant bits stored in the tag RAM match the most 
significant bits of the address currently being generated, 
with the least significant bits of this address acting as 
an index to the tag RAM, a cache "hit" has occurred and the 
data to be read may be taken from the corresponding data 
cache entry. If data corresponding to the desired address 
is not located in the data cache memory, the tag entry will 
not match the most significant bits of the address, and a 
"miss" occurs. This indicates that the data must be 
retrieved from main system memory and placed into the data 
cache memory. When transferring data from a data cache memory and 
main memory, a cache controller must communicate an address 
to main memory for each transfer. The cache controller 
communicates with the main memory over the system bus. At 
the time when the cache controller needs to communicate 
with main memory, the system bus may be controlled by other 
devices. Thus, the cache controller is required to
