<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for the repetitive selection of 
a group of items which utilizes a series of sensors 

associated mounted in a frame structure adjacent supplies 
of items so that the manual selection of an item or items 

from a supply can be monitored. A programmable logic 
controller is utilized for allowing the system to be 

"taught" so that it can easily be used for the repetitive 
selection of many different desired groups of items 

without the necessity of rewiring or constructing a 
totally new device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to inventory control
systems and, more particularly, to controlling the
sequence and completeness of selection of items on a
repetitive bases.Particularly in the consumer goods market, but also
in other areas of commerce, it is common for the
manufacturer to be required to package and ship groups of
parts for use in the subsequent assembly of an article.
For example, large toys and bicycles are often sold
partially assembled and are packaged with the appropriate
number and kind of fasteners and parts to allow complete
assembly by the purchaser. If, however, the wrong types
or numbers of fasteners and smaller parts are supplied or
missing, the purchaser is delayed in his or her assembly
and must either return the purchased article or request
that the additional parts be supplied. This incomplete
or erroneous packaging thus causes loss of consumer
satisfaction with his or her purchase and ultimately loss
of confidence in the ability of the manufacturer to
supply a complete package for assembly.In the past, the difficulty for the manufacturer has
been the human error in the manual repetitive selection
of items to form the desired group of items. In such a
selection process it is common to provide a plurality of
bins or other containers each of which holds a plurality
of one of the parts to be selected. These bins are
usually adjacent one another so as to allow the worker to
select the desired parts or items to form the desired
group. However, no matter how careful the worker is, it
is common to have an occasional error in the selection
process and the number of errors depends on the skill and
care of the individual worker. Therefore, it is usually 
necessary to constantly check the groups selected by the
workers to ensure that the selection process is being carried
out correctly and completely. The quality control process
usually involves the random checking of selected groups of
items to see if they are complete. However, even this checking
results in some missed groups of improperpy selected items
which eventually get to the consumer.One known system is disclosed in US-A-5,201,429 which
discloses an apparatus for controlling manual item selection
order and completeness by a human operator which comprises: a
frame structure forming a plurality of openings through which a
hand can be inserted, each associated with a supply of an item;
a plurality of lights supported by said frame structure
adjacent respective openings where they are visible by the
operator; a plurality of

Apparatus for controlling manual item selection order and
completeness by a human operator, said apparatus comprising:


a frame structure (10-14) through which a hand can be
inserted, associated with several supplies (30, 32) of items;
a plurality of lights (26, 28) supported by said frame
structure adjacent respective openings where they are visible

by the operator;
a plurality of sensors (22, 24) supported by said frame
for sensing access by the hand of the operator to each item,

each sensor corresponding to an item to be selected; and
programmable logic control means (24) connected to each
sensor for receiving and storing signals therefrom, said

programmable logic control means being connected and adapted
such that an initial sequence is recorded in which the signals

are received,
switch means (38) being provided which are movable to a
learning position permitting the programmable logic control

means to receive and store the signals, and a running position
for permitting the programmable logic control means to compare

subsequent signals from the sensors to the recorded signals,
characterised in that said frame structure (10-14) is formed

separately from and is mountable in front of an installation
having said several supplies (30, 32) of items, the size, shape

and number of said openings defined by said frame being
variable to suit the needs of a particular installation, and in

that said programmable logic control means (24) thereafter
activate said lights serially one at a time in the stored

sequence so as to guide the operator in the selection sequence,
said means further comparing subsequent signals from the

sensors as the operator inserts his hand to the recorded
sequence of initial signals and deactivating said lights in the

sequence as an item is accessed by the operator and providing a
warning signal to the operator if the sequence is different.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised
in that said switching means (38) causes a new sequence

of signals to be recorded in the programmable logic
control means in place of the initial sequence when

switched from the running position to the learning
position.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that a plurality of bins (30,32) each

containing a supply of an item, are disposed adjacent the
openings (20) and support a sensor (22,24) adjacent each

bin.
Apparatus according to claims 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that an item selection counter which

maintains a count of the items being selected, and a
reset button 42 which decrements the item selection

counter if an improper access has been sensed by a sensor
are associated with said programmable logic controller. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim,
characterised in that said openings (20) are each surrounded

by portions (12-18) of said frame structure.
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in
that said portions (12-18) are dismountable components,

which can be assembled, whereby the size, shape and number
of the openings can be varied to suit the needs of a

particular installation.
