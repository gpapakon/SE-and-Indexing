<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of improving the adhesion 
between a polymeric adhesive and an encapsulating material of 
the type used to encapsulate a semiconductor chip. More 
particularly, it relates to a method which includes treatment 
of the polymeric adhesive so as to increase the number of 
sites to which the encapsulating material may adhere, thereby 
improving adhesion between the polymeric adhesive and the 
encapsulating material. A useful method of packaging a semiconductor chip is known to 
those in the art as lead-on-chip packaging. This method is 
described in further detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,862,245, 
issued August 29, 1989, to Pashby et al. and entitled "Package 
Semiconductor Chip". The contents of U.S. Patent No. 
4,862,245 are hereby incorporated by reference in order to 
more fully describe the state of the art to which the subject 
invention pertains. Briefly, lead-on-chip packaging utilizes a lead frame having a 
plurality of conductors. The lead frame is attached to a 
major surface of a semiconductor chip using adhesives. 
Typically, a two-sided adhesive tape is utilized. One side of 
the adhesive tape is attached to the top or active side of the 
chip and the other or top side of the adhesive tape is 
attached to the lead frame. If desired, one side of the tape 
may be coated with a first adhesive and the other side of the 
tape may be coated with a second, different adhesive. The top 
side of the tape is often coated with a polymeric adhesive. 
Wires are then bonded to connect the terminals on the 
semiconductor chip to the lead frame conductors. The adhesive  
 
tape, semiconductor chip, wires, and portions of the lead 
frame are then encapsulated in an encapsulating material. It is important to the lead-on-chip packaging method to obtain 
as strong an adhesion as possible between the adhesive on the 
top side of the adhesive tape and the encapsulating material. 
If the adhesion is not adequate, the integrity of the 
semiconductor chip package may be compromised. A need thus exists for a method of improving the adhesion 
between the adhesive on the top side of the adhesive tape and 
the encapsulating material. This need for improved adhesion between the adhesive and the 
encapsulating material is met by the method of the subject 
invention. Briefly described, the present invention is a method of 
improving the adhesion between a polymeric adhesive and an 
encapsulating material of the type used to encapsulate a 
semiconductor chip. The method comprises providing a 
poly
