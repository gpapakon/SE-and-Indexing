<ABSTRACT>
A filtering apparatus (10) comprises an endless filter belt (20) which is moved through a tank (14) containing contaminated liquid by a drive means (18). Cleansed liquid is removed from the belt by means of a syphon (16) having a syphon tube (38) with a mouth (40) in contact with the belt filter (20). Cleansed liquid is discharged into a tank (24) through a valve (46).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a belt filter for removing 
contaminant from water or other liquids having a viscosity 
similar to that of water. A common form of filter comprises a fine woven wire mesh which 
is static and is used as a gravity filter. The capacity of 
such a filter is restricted in its liquid handling capacity 
due to the surface tension that supports the droplets of 
liquid formed under the wire mesh. The smaller the droplets 
are the stronger the surface tension and the stronger the 
surface tension the bigger the resistance to flow through the 
filter. Also in such a situation the wire mesh will very 
quickly blind and close off or seriously restrict throughput 
of liquids to be filtered. The present invention seeks to improve the water handling 
capacity of a belt filter by immersing the filter cloth in the 
liquid to be cleaned thereby removing surface tension, and 
moving the filter cloth through the contaminated liquid. Accordingly the present invention provides liquid filtration 
apparatus comprising an endless continuously movable filtering  
 
medium, a container of contaminated liquid, means for depressing 
a section of the filtering medium so as to provide a region 
thereof which is immersed in the contaminated liquid, driving 
means for moving the filtering medium, including through the 
contaminated liquid in the aforesaid immersed region, means for 
removing cleansed liquid from above the immersed region of the 
filtering medium, and means for cleaning contaminants from the 
filtering medium, characterised in that the means for removing 
cleansed liquid comprises a syphon having a tube with a mouth 
which contacts the filtering medium and serves as the means for 
depressing the aforesaid section thereof. Preferably the filtering medium comprises a wire mesh cloth belt. The contaminated liquid container can have an inlet through which 
contaminated liquid is received and an outlet from which 
contaminated liquid is discharged and the level of contaminated 
liquid can be controlled by liquid level sensing means and a 
moveable weir located upstream of the outlet which functions in 
dependence of the signal from the liquid level sensing means. The drive means can comprise two or more rubber covered rollers 
over which the endless filtering medium passes, one of the 
rollers being driven by a variable speed drive motor and another 
roller being adjustable in position to maintain tension in the 
filtering medium. Preferably the drive roller is cambered.

Liquid filtration apparatus (10) comprising an endless 
continuously moveable filtering medium (20, 20A), a container 

(14) of contaminated liquid, means for depressing a section of 
the filtering medium so as to provide a region thereof which 

is immersed in the contaminated liquid, driving means (18) for 
moving the filtering medium (20, 20A), including through 

the contaminated liquid in the aforesaid immersed region, 
means for removing cleansed liquid from above the immersed 

region of the filtering medium, and means (58, 64) for 
cleaning contaminants from the filtering medium, 

characterised in that the means for removing cleansed 
liquid comprises a syphon (16) having a tube (38) with a 

mouth (40) which contacts the filtering medium (20, 20A) 
and serves as the means for depressing the aforesaid 

section thereof. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which the filtering 
medium (20, 20A) comprises a fine synthetic woven wire mesh 

belt. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 in which the 
contaminated liquid container (14) has an inlet (32) 

through which contaminated liquid is received and an outlet 
(36) from which concentrated contaminated liquid is 

discharged, the level (67) of contaminated liquid being  
 

controlled by a liquid level sensing means and a moveable 
weir (34) located upstream of the outlet (36). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in which the 
drive means (18) comprises two or more rollers (64, 66) 

over which the filtering medium (20, 20A) passes one of the 
rollers (64) being driven by variable speed drive motor and 

the other roller (66) being adjustable in position to 
maintain tension in the filtering medium. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 4 in which the rollers (64, 
66) are rubber covered and the drive roller (64) is 

cambered. 
Apparatus as claimed in claims 4 or 5 in which the rollers 
are supported above and clear of the contaminated liquid 

level and the mouth (40) of the syphon tube (38) is less in 
width than the filtering medium thereby forcing the edges 

of the filtering medium to turn up and remain above the 
level of the contaminated liquid, the edges of the 

filtering medium (20, 20A) being maintained in this 
configuration by contact strips on the sides of the 

container (14). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in which the 
mouth (40) of the syphon tube (38) is generally rectangular 

in shape.  
 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in which the 
mouth (40) of the syphon tube (38) is provided with support 

bars (40B) in contact with the filtering medium (20, 20A). 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in which the 
syphon (16) has a drop leg (42) terminating in a valve 

(46). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 9 in which the valve (46) can 
be operated by a ram (48) and/or by a float. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in which the 
syphon (16) includes a priming valve (56) admitting clean 

water to the syphon. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim in which the 
cleaning means comprises a static array of water jets (58) 

extending across the width of the filtering medium. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 12 in which the cleaning 
means includes a high pressure oscillating water jet (64'). 
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8 in which the 
syphon (16) has a drop leg (50) having its base submerged 

in a container (24) of the cleansed liquid, and suction 
means (52) connected to the syphon 
via
 a valve (56) to the 
syphon.
