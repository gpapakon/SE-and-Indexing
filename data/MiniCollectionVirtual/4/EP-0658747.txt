<ABSTRACT>
A continuous casting mold comprises a mold tube 
encased in a water jacket. Means are provided for 

gauging the level of molten metal in the mold tube so 
that it can be maintained near the top of the mold tube 

without overflowing. The gauging means comprise a 
radioactive source on one side of the mold tube and 

scintillation crystal detector on the opposite side of 
the mold tube. The amount of radioactive source material 

is maintained at an inherently safe level by disposing 
the source material in one or more recesses in the wall 

of the mold tube and by employment of a "gel" light tube 
connection between the scintillation crystal and a 

photomultiplier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in 
gauging various conditions as a function of the amount 
of radiation absorbed and more particularly to 
improvements in gauging the level of molten metal during 
the continuous casting of billets, blooms, slabs and the 
like. Radiation absorption gauging, in its basic terms, 
comprises the provision of a radioactive source and a 
detector spaced therefrom. The radioactive source is a 
continuously disintegrating material which emits 
particles/energy in the form of alpha, beta and gamma 
rays in transmuting to a lighter, elemental material. 
The detector is responsive to the impingement of these 
particles/energy to provide a given signal level, which 
is inversely proportionate to the square of the distance 
between the source and detector. When an object is disposed between the source and 
the detector, or the aggregate density of the medium 
between the source and the detector is otherwise 
increased, the source emissions will be absorbed by the 
increased mass of the intervening medium and the output 
signal from the detector will be proportionately 
reduced. In gauging the level of molten metal, the 
radioactive source is disposed either outside the metal 
jacket or in the cooling water chamber of the water 
jacket, on one side of the mold tube. The detector is 
similarly disposed, on the opposite side of the mold 
tube, outside the water jacket or in the cooling water 
chamber of the water jacket. There is thus created a 
radiation field that spans a portion of the height of 
the mold tube adjacent its upper end. The intensity of 
the radiation impinging on the detector, and the output 
signal therefrom, is inversely proportional to the 
degree to which molten metal absorbs radiation, which in  
 
turn is a function of the level of the molten metal in 
the tube. In gauging the level of molten metal, the walls of 
the mold tube, two steel plates that define a cooling 
water flow path and several layers of water, and, in 
many cases, the steel outer walls of the water jacket 
comprise a fixed absorber, which sets a threshold value 
of radiation strength that must be exceeded in order to 
be able to measure the condition of interest, i.e., the 
mold tube. While not necessarily so limited, the present 
invention focuses on the radioactive absorption gauging 
of the level of molten metal in a mold tube in a 
continuous casting process. Man made, cesium-137 has been found uniquely suited 
as the radioactive source material for absorption 
gauging and
