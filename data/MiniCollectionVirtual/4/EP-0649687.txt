<ABSTRACT>
The tube bending machine has a rotatable bending form (14) and a pivoted arm (21) which can be pivoted about the axis of the bending form and carries a clamping jaw (22). In order to be able to carry out both clockwise and anticlockwise bending of a tube (27), the bending form (14) consists of two parts (15,16), each designed for a different direction of bending. The clamping jaw (22) too consists of parts (23,24) for different directions of bending. Slide rails (32,33) are arranged on both sides of the bending head.

<CLAIMS>
A pipe bending machine with a rotatable bending template (14), a pivot arm (21)
pivotable about the axis of the bending template (14) by 180Â°, the pivot arm supporting

a clamping jaw (22),

characterized in that

the bending template (14) comprises two template pans (15, 26) arranged one above the
other, one of the parts being designed for bending to the right, while the other is for

bending to the left, the clamping jaw (22) being designed both for bending to the right
and to the left and having a respective jaw member (23, 24) on each side of a plane

extending transversely to the clamping jaw (22) and including the axis of the bending
template, wherein, for clamping a pipe section, the lower jaw member (23) cooperates

with the lower template part (15) and the upper jaw member (24) cooperates with the
upper template part (16), and that a respective slide rail (32, 33) is provided on both

sides of the bending head (14) to act as an abutment for the unbent pipe section.
The pipe bending machine according to claim 1, characterized in that in one end
position of the pivot arm (21), one slide rail (32) extends beneath the upper jaw member

(24) and that in the other end position, the other slide rail (33) extends above the
lower jaw member (23).
