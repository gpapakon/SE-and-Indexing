<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plane array 
antenna for receiving satellite broadcasting programs to 
be utilized by being loaded on a car or the like. Along with the diffusion of satellite 
broadcasting in recent years, there have been many 
studies being carried out on car-loaded antennas for 
receiving a satellite broadcasting. For this type of 
car-loaded antenna, how to reduce the height for fitting 
the antenna is one of the important technical issues 
because the antenna is usually fitted on the top of the 
car which runs on a load with height restrictions. 
Further, since the antenna for receiving a satellite 
broadcasting is fitted on the top of the car with a 
limited space, how to reduce the area for installing the 
antenna is also one of the important technical issues. 
In order to reduce the height for fitting the antenna 
for receiving a satellite broadcasting, a structure for 
horizontally fitting the plane array antenna having a 
tilt angle on the top of the car is considered to be 
advantageous. Main beams irradiated from this type of 
plane array antenna are being irradiated in the 
direction which is deviated by a tilt angle from the  
 
normal direction of the plane array antenna. In a car-loaded antenna, an automatic tracing 
mechanism for controlling both an azimuth angle and an 
elevation angle of the antenna is necessary so that the 
antenna can always trace a broadcasting satellite that 
changes every moment along with the move of the car. 
The automatic tracing mechanism not only occupies a 
substantial portion of the manufacturing expenses of the 
whole receiving system but also increases the height and 
area for fitting the antenna. Therefore, how to 
simplify the automatic tracing system has been one of 
the important technical issues. Changes of an azimuth 
angle occurs over 360° along with the move of the car, 
and therefore, it is considered realistic to achieve the 
tracing in the direction of the azimuth angle by a 
mechanical rotation mechanism. In contrast to this 
trend, changes of an elevation angle occur along with 
the longitude or the slope from the horizontal plane, 
that is, the slope of the load of about ± 5°. Therefore, 
the range of the changes of the elevation angle is 
relatively limited. As a result, it has been considered 
advantageous to economize the whole of the receiving 
system by employing an elevation angle direction non-tracing 
system for not performing a mechanical tracing 
in the elevation angle, or a uniaxial tracing system for 
tracing
