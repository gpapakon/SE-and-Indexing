<ABSTRACT>
The proposed method provides for one-stage treatment of an alumina-containing raw-material with a mixture of alkali 
metal salts of a fluorine-containing oxygen-free acid and hydrochloric acid taken at the ratio of respectively from 5:1 to 1:7.5 

parts by weight. The mixture of the salts is introduced at the quantity of 40-85 % of the total weight, and treatment is carried 
out at a temperature of 850-1100 °C up to obtaining a reactional mass consisting of non-mixing fluoride-silicate and chloride-aluminate 

alkaline melts. The chloride-aluminate alkaline melt is separated from the obtained mass and introduced to the 
melt of alkali metal chlorides, and the obtained mass is subjected to electrolysis up to obtaining the desired product. The 

invention may be used in the fields of technology connected with the obtaining and use of aluminium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of nonferrous 
metallurgy and in particular deals with a method 
of producing aluminum from aluminous raw material. At present, the main ores for production of aluminum 
are high-grade low-silicon bauxites from which alumina 
is extracted by the Bayer method, with subsequent reduction 
of aluminum by electrolysis of cryolite-aluminous 
melts. In spite of a number of improvements, this method 
of producing aluminum by electrolysis of cryolite-aluminous 
melts remains energy intensive and doesn't correspond 
to modern requirements of environmental protection. 
The problem of the source of raw materials of the alumina 
and aluminum industry becomes pressing in a number of 
countries with a developed aluminum production industry 
and possessing restricted resources of bauxitic ores or 
without such resources at all. A great number of investigations 
in these countries is aimed at providing less 
energy intensive methods of producing aluminum among 
which the most promising is a widely known chlorination 
of aluminous ores and electrolytic reduction of the obtained 
aluminum chloride. Aluminum is third in abundance in the Earth's crust 
among all the elements and first among metals (G.V.Voitkevich, 
O.A.Bessonov "Khimicheskaya evolutsia zemli", 
Moscow,"Nedra" Publishing House,1986,p.127) and in the 
main aluminum forms with oxygen a complex anion (AlO₄)⁵⁻ 
in a quaternary coordination and forms alumo-oxygen tetrahedrons 
approaching in size silicon-oxygen tetrahedrons 
(SiO₄)⁴⁻. Connected with this is mainly paragenetic interrelation 
of aluminum with silicon in the Earth's crust 
and wide occurence of aluminous ores - kaolin clays, 
disthene-sillimanite-andalusite slates, etc. In case of  
 
providing technology mined economically, countries leading 
in aluminum production won't be dependent upon import 
of bauxites and chloride method of electrolysis will allow 
to reduce energy consumption for aluminum production by 
35-45%. Also known in the art is a method of producing aluminum 
(US,A,4,108,741) from an electrolyte of the following 
composition, % by mass: 60-87 AlCl₃, 14-30 NaCl, 5-10 KCl, 
0.1-3.0 magnesium or calcium chloride. The method of producing 
aluminum from such an electrolyte stipulates conduction 
of electrolysis at an anode current density of 0.5-200 
A/dm², a cathode current density of. 0.5-200 A/dm² and a 
voltage of an electrolytic cell of about 2.7-11.4 V.After 
electrolysis there is formed a spongy precipitate containing 
from 30 to 60% by
