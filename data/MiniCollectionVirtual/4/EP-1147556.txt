<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical assembly for regulating the temperature of an integrated circuit chip is comprised of a frame (70) which has two spaced-apart spring supports (72). A single leaf spring (80) extends from one of the spring supports to the other. A heat exchanger (90) contacts the leaf spring at one point, pushes the leaf spring against the spring supports, and has a face (91) for mating with the chip. And, a pair of stop (100) is provided between the heat exchanger (90) and the frame (70), which keeps the heat exchanger on the leaf spring (80). With this assembly the heat exchanger (90) exerts a very small force at its initial point of contact on the chip; the length of the single leaf spring (80) does not add to the profile of the assembly; no slippage occurs between the heat exchanger (90) and the chip; and, the stop prevents the heat exchanger from twisting and becoming offset relative to the chip.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mechanical assemblies that regulate the temperature of an electronic device, such as an integrated circuit chip, by pressing a temperature controlled heat exchanger against the chip.In the prior art, one assembly of the above type is described in U.S. Patent 4,791,983 which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The assembly in patent '983 uses a coil spring 20 to press a planar surface of a liquid cooling jacket against a planar surface of an integrated circuit chip. More specifically, the coil spring 20 is compressed in a direction perpendicular to the planar surfaces of the liquid cooling jacket and the integrated circuit chip to squeeze those surfaces together and thereby lower the thermal resistance between them.Due to various manufacturing tolerances, the planar surface of the integrated circuit chip (to which the cooling jacket mates) can be oriented at different angles and different heights relative to a nominal position. To accommodate these variances, the assembly in patent '983 includes a guidepost 18 which is attached to the cooling jacket, extends perpendicular to the mating faces of the cooling jacket and the integrated circuit chip, and is loosely held by a beam 14. This guidepost, together with the coil spring and the cooling jacket, can tilt at different angles and move to different heights to thereby accommodate the variations in the orientation of the integrated circuit chip.With the assembly of patent '983, it is desirable for the coil spring to have a small spring constant. That is because when the planar surface on the cooling jacket initially contacts the planar surface on the integrated circuit chip, those two surfaces will be at different angles, so contact will initially occur at a single point on the corner of the chip. If the coil spring has a small spring constant, then the force that is exerted at the initial point of contact will be small and the chances of cracking the corner of the chip will be reduced.On the other hand, to insure that the thermal resistance between the mating surfaces of the cooling jacket and the chip is sufficiently small, the final force with which those two surfaces are pressed together must be large. Thus to achieve this large final force with a small spring constant, the coil spring 20 must have a long length. However, increasing the length of the spring 20 inherently increases the minimal distance with which several of the assemblies can be placed side-by-side in a rack within an end-product.Also, after
