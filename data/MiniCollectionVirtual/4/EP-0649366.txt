<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a milling cutter for producing rabbets in wood, in particular in doors or windows. The cutter has a cutting head (10) on whose circumferential surface at least one blade (29) intended to produce the rabbet is fixed. Mounted on the side (9) of the cutting head (10) normal to the axis of rotation (5) of the head is at least one tool (13) with curved cutting edges (15, 16) for rounding the rim (3) and corner (3') of the rabbet. This tool (13) is seated in a recess in the side (9) of the cutting head (10) and projects out slightly beyond the circumferential surface (6) of the head. It lies against one wall (12) of the recess (11) and is clamped against this wall by a clamping plate (17) securely screwed to another wall (18) of the recess (11). The screw (19) used for this purpose passes through the clamping plate (17), and its head (30) is accessible from the side (9) of the cutting head (10) in which the recess (11) is located.

<CLAIMS>
A milling cutter for machining grooves (2) in wood and 
for rounding off the groove's edge (3), in particular on doors 

or windows, comprising a milling head (10) having a substantially 
cylindrical peripheral surface, said milling head 

bearing, preferably on said peripheral surface, at least one 
cutting means (8), in particular a turnover plate cutter, for 

making the groove, and on its lateral surface (9) which is 
perpendicular to the axis of rotation (5) at least one plate-like 

tool (13), preferably a turnover plate cutter, which is 
separated from said cutting means (8) and rounds the edge (3) 

of the groove off produced by said cutting means (8), and which 
is arranged within a pocket (11) of said lateral surface (9) 

where one surface engages a flat wall (12) of the pocket (11) 
being clamped to said wall (12), said wall (12) of the pocket 

(11) extending up to the peripheral surface of the milling head 
(10) and being inclined with respect to the axis of rotation 

(5) of the milling tool as well as to a radial plane through 
the axis of rotation (5), wherein a screw (19) for clamping the 

tool (13) is provided whose screw head (30) is accessible from 
the lateral surface (9) of the milling head (10) which 

comprises said pocket (11), characterised in that the tool (13) 
provided with curved cutting edges (16 and 15) acting upon the 

corner (3') and the edge (3) of the groove, the cutting edge 
(16 and 15) acting upon the corner (3') projecting slightly 

over the peripheral surface (6) of the milling head (10), and 
that the tool (13) is fixedly clamped by a clamping plate (17) 

screwed by said screw (19) to another wall (18) of the pocket 
(11), its lateral edge (20) engaging the tool (13), said screw 

(19) penetrating the clamping plate (17). 
Milling cutter according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the tool (13) is secured by pins (22) to the wall (12) of 

the pocket against shifting in the direction of the plane of 
said wall (12), said pins (22) being located with a clearance 

within openings (23) which receive them.  
 
Milling cutter according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the pins (22) are fastened to the wall (12) of the pocket 

(11). 
Milling cutter according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the axis of the screw (19) for screwing 

tightly the clamping plate (17) extends parallel to the axis of 
rotation (5) of the milling head (10).
