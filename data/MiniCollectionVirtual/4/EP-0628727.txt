<ABSTRACT>
Circumferential and radial inlet pressure 
distortion on an aircraft gas turbine engine (10) are 

detected by a plurality of static pressure sensors 
(16,18) and a signal processor (12), which computes the 

total pressure for each sensor to determine a pressure 
distortion pattern which the processor correlates with 

stored data for the engine and inlet to determine if the 
airflow geometry should be altered during flight. Time 

varying changes in the pressure from one or more of the 
pressure sensors is used to determine a stall condition, 

causing a change in engine airflow geometry to increase 
stall margin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gas turbine engines, in 
particular, gas turbine engine control based on inlet 
pressure distortion. Future aircraft gas turbine engines must have the 
capability to successfully accommodate the increased 
steady-state and dynamic inlet pressure distortion that 
is encountered on high speed aircraft operating at 
supersonic speeds, and on aircraft with high 
maneuverability thrust vectoring. These distortion 
effects directly impact compressor stall margin, and 
future engine systems, which will be designed with less 
stall margin to reduce compression system weight. 
Reduced design stall margin is made practical by the 
newer adaptive engine control systems that are capable 
of maintaining adequate stall stability by adjusting the 
steady state and transient compression system component 
match points to instantaneous engine operating 
conditions. Inlet pressure distortion and inlet 
recovery are but factors--although very important--in 
establishing the instantaneous stability requirements. 
In a contemporary adaptive control system, these factors 
are not measured but are represented by non-adaptive 
model algorithms. The margins that are required to 
account for high pressure distortion operation reduces 
the potential benefit of the adaptive control concept 
during normal engine operation. The relationship between compressor stall and inlet 
conditions is known. U.S. patent 5,165,844, for 
instance, also assigned to the assignee of this 
application, discusses some techniques to control 
compressor "stall margin", and may be considered 
representative of the state of the art dynamic, real-time 
techniques that control engine geometry with active  
 
components such as stators and variable exhaust nozzles. Variations in pressure across and around the 
compressor inlet duct (radial and circumferential 
pressure variations) can be so uneven at times as to put 
substantial portions of the compressor in operating 
conditions at or below proper stall pressure ratios. 
U.S. patent 4,872,807, also assigned to the assignee of 
this application, considers a technique that measures 
inlet pressure at the compressor axis, but not inlet 
pressure distortion, as part of a scheme to control 
"engine geometry" with a control, to regulate stall 
margin levels. The patent describes a computation 
process, partially harnessed in this invention, by which 
the static pressure yields a dynamic pressure component 
based on the instantaneous engine operating conditions, 
namely N1, N2, T2 and PT2.
