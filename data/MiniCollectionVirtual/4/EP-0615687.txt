<ABSTRACT>
A catching device consisting of a catching housing (1), a handle housing (7), a flexible slide (4) for closing the catching opening (6) and an actuating button (5) for displacing the flexible slide is indicated. The handle part of the handle housing is made narrower than the catching housing so that the flexible slide consists of a narrow displacement section (4b) and a wide closing section (4a) and correspondingly the handle housing consists of a widened section (7a) and a narrower handle section (7b). The catching housing with a guide tongue (11) formed on its rear wall is clamped on the end wall (14) of the vertically divided handle housing via a clamping mounting (10). The individual components of the device are provided with a system of guide elements integrated therein, namely a holding-down strip on the actuating button, lateral guide strips (22) in the narrow handle section, the guide in the deflection region of the flexible slide on the slope (7c) of the handle housing, on guide ribs (24), guide strips (25) and guide tongues (11) and on guide edges (26) and guide noses (27) at the catching opening.

the flexible slide plate (4) of the grip casing (7) and 

to the width ("b") between the lateral guide edges on the 
catching opening (6) and the width ("b") of the narrow 

sliding portion (4b) of the flexible slide plate (4) 
roughly coincides with the internal width in the narrow, 

straight path portion (7b) of the grip casing (7).
