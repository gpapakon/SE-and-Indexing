<ABSTRACT>
A first portion (1) of pipe section affords a 
large internal cavity (2) superiorly closed by a 

second portion (3) which is detachable and 
provided with pre-weakened longitudinal recesses 

(4). The second portion (3) superiorly comprises 
at least one flat external surface (6) destined to 

be located on a same level as that of the pigsty 
floor.

<DESCRIPTION>
Known-type pigsties have gridded or slotted floors 
to catch and collect animal excrement and effluvia 
in underlying channels or containers so that it 
can be disposed of. A flooring having the features as set forth in 
preamble portion of claim 1 is known for example 
from US-A 4,346,670. Also known are floors comprising a plurality of 
modular elements (concrete beams) laid side-by-side 
and arranged on a same plane. The beams 
exhibit double-T-shaped straight transversal 
sections, which when laid side-by-side give rise 
to the said channels with an underlying collection 
channel. The channels are lined with a waterproof 
substance, generally plastic sections open on an 
upper side. A functional problem connected with such known 
floors is the impossibility of guaranteeing 
perfect adhesion of the plastic sections to the 
sides of the concrete channels, which can easily 
lead to infiltration of excreta between the 
channels and the plastic sections, often 
inaccessible to normal cleaning operation methods.  
 A further problem of the above art is its high 
cost. The present invention aims to obviate the above 
drawbacks by providing a flooring having the features as set 
forth in the characterising portion of claim 1. An advantage of the invention is that is it simple 
and fast to install, even in large sties. Further, 
the channel sections are light and easy to 
transport. A still further advantage is constituted by the 
resultant increase in workspeed. Further characteristics and advantages of the 
present invention will better emerge from the 
detailed description that follows, of an 
embodiment of the invention, illustrated in the 
form of a non-limiting example in the accompanying 
drawings, in which: 
figure 1 shows a schematic transversal section 
of a tract of floor realised using the invention;  
 figure 2 shows the tract of floor of figure 1 
after the detachable neck section of the sections 
has been removed, giving rise to the final 
configuration of the sty floor. The floor illustrated comprises a plurality of 
tubular sections, laid side-by side and set in a 
mass of concrete (though other materials could be 
used instead of concrete). Each tubular section comprises a first portion 1 
affording a large internal cavity 2. A second portion 3 superiorly closes the internal 
cavity 2. The second portion 3 laterally exhibits 
two pre-weakened longitudinal recesses 4, whereat 
the section is of a reduced thickness. The second 
portion 3 is easily pressure-detachable from the 
first portion 1

<CLAIMS>
A drainage pipe section, in particular for pigsty 
floors, comprising a first 

portion (1) affording a large internal cavity (2) 
superiorly closed by a second portion (3) which is 

detachable and provided with pre-weakened 
longitudinal recesses (4); the second portion (3) 

superiorly comprising at least one flat external 
surface (6) destined to be located on a same level 

as that of the pigsty floor,
 
characterised in that said second 

portion (3) comprises two further pre-weakened longitudinal recesses 
(7) arranged at the sides of the external surface (6), 

at an attachment zone of said external surface with said second 
portion. 
A drainage pipe section 
as in claim 1, 

characterised in that the 
second portion (3) comprises two tracts of 

symmetrical and facing lateral wall (5); a 
distance between the lateral wall tracts (5) 

increasing gradually from the external surface (6) 
downwards.  

 
A drainage pipe section as in claim 2, 
characterised in that the second portion (3) 

comprises two projections (8) arranged laterally 
to edges of the external surface (6) and 

constituting concave connection tracts with an 
external surface of t
he lateral wall tracts (5). 
A drainage pipe section as in claim 1 
characterised in that the first portion (1) 

comprises a plurality of anchoring fins (9), (10), 
projecting externalwise from said first portion 

(1). 
A drainage pipe section as in claim 4, 
characterised in that it comprises at least two 

anchoring fins (10) arranged superiorly at edges 
of the first portion (1) and turned in an upwards 

direction.
