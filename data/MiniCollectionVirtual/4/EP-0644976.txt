<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a hinge, in particular a hinge for switch-cabinet and instrument-cabinet doors, the hinge comprising a part fitted to the door and a part fitted to the cabinet which engage with each other for rotational motion by means of at least one hinge pin. In order to ensure that the hinge parts can be separated and reassembled rapidly and simply, the invention calls for at least one hinge part (10, 40) to be designed in two elements, via a first and a second element (11, 12; 41, 42), which can be displaced relative to each other in the longitudinal direction to enable the other part (20; 50) to be inserted and withdrawn again.

least one hinge pin (13, 14; 51),
characterized
 in

that at least one hinge part which is the door-side
hinge part (40) or the cabinet-side hinge part (10)

is constructed from two portions and has a first and
a second door-side hinge portion (41, 42) and a first

and a second cabinet-side hinge portion (11, 12) respectively,
that the first and second door-side hinge portions
(41, 42) and the first and second cabinet-side hinge

portions (11, 12), respectively are constructed homologously
to each other and can be fixed independently

of one another, and are axially adjustable relative
to one another and independently adjustable of one

another for insertion and release of in each case
the other hinge part which in the case of a door-side

hinge part (40) which is constructed from two portions
and has the first and second door-side hinge portions

(41, 42) is the cabinet-side hinge part (50) and in
the case of a cabinet-side hinge part (10) which is

constructed from two portions and has the first and
second hinge portions (11, 12) is the door-side hinge

part (20).
Hinge according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that

the cabinet-side hinge part (10) which is constructed
from two portions has as the first cabinet-side hinge

portion a lower cabinet-side hinge portion (11) and as
the second cabinet-side hinge portion an upper cabinet-side

hinge portion (12),
on the lower and on the upper cabinet-side hinge portions
(11, 12) in each case is provided a mounting

flange (15, 16) having a fastening area (17, 18), and
said fastening area (17, 18) is constructed for an

adjustable fixing of the associated lower or upper
cabinet-side hinge-portion (11, 12).
Hinge according to claim 2,
characterized
 in that

the door-side hinge part (20) is constructed integrally
and is positioned between the lower and the

upper cabinet-side hinge portions (11, 12), and
a lower and an upper hinge pin (13, 14) placed in each

case on the lower and upper cabinet-side hinge portions
(11, 12) engages in a hinge hole (21) of the

door-side hinge part (20) or a hinge pin projecting
on either side on the door-side hinge part (20) engages

in bearing holes of the lower and upper cabinet-side
hinge portions (11, 12).
Hinge according to claims 2 or 3,
characterized
 in that

a travel path is formed between the mounting flanges
(15, 16) of the lower cabinet-side hinge portion (11)

and the upper cabinet-side hinge portion (12) and
which is virtually equal to or greater than the hinge

pin length (13, 14) insertable in the door-side hinge
hole (21).
Hinge according to one of the preceding claims 2 to 4,
characterized
 in that

the lower and upper hinge pins (13, 14) in each case
is firmly received in a sleeve-like receptacle (25,

26) and are held on the mounting flange (15, 16) of
the lower and the upper cabinet-side hinge portions

(11, 12) respectively by means of a hinge pin support
(24, 28).
Hinge according to one of the preceding claims 2 to 5,
characterized
 in that

the lower and upper cabinet-side hinge portions
(11, 12) are fixed to a cabinet, e.g. to a vertical

beam (2),
the door-side hinge part (20) can be mounted on the
lower 
hinge pin (13), and
the upper cabinet-side hinge portion (12) inserted
with the hinge pin (14) in the hinge-hole (21) is

longitudinally adjustable and/or lockable.
Hinge according to one of the preceding claims 2 to 6,
characterized
 in that

in the fastening area (17, 18) of the lower and upper
cabinet-side hinge portions (12, 13) is formed an

elongated hole (30, 31) and a depression (32, 33) for
receiving a countersunk screw (34), the axial length

of the elongated hole (30, 31) being determined by
the necessary travel path x for releasing the door-side

hinge hole (21).
Hinge according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that

a door-side hinge part (40) which is constructed from
two portions has as a first door-side hinge portion

door-side hinge portion (42) an upper door-side hinge

portion (42), and
each of said door-side hinge portions (41, 42) has a
