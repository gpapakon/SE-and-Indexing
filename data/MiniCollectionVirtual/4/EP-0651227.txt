<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a phased array antenna system (1) 
by means of which, besides normal radar transmissions, also 

a guidance of a number of semi-active homing missiles (3) 
towards a number of targets (2) can be effected. 

The main problem to be solved here is that a rear-reference 
signal for each missile (3) remains present to a sufficient 

extent also during the periods covering normal radar 
transmissions. The invention solves this problem by 

transmitting rear-reference signals for all missiles (3) 
deployed simultaneously with radar transmitter signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a phased array antenna system provided with a
phased array antenna for generating a pencil beam and designed for
realising radar transmissions.Such radar apparatuses are used for target detection and tracking. If a target
is to be engaged with a semi-active homing type of missile, this selected
target is, according to the state of the art, illuminated by means of an
illuminator which uninterruptedly transmits CW microwave radiation in the
direction of the target.If the operational requirements are such that a plurality of targets are to be
simultaneously engaged, a number of illuminators equalling the number of
targets shall be available. This renders the installation unduly expensive. In
addition, the control of a number of scattered illuminators constitutes a major
problem, in view of each illuminator having its individual parallax error and
possible other errors, for instance resulting from torsional or bending forces
applied to the ship's hull. Consequently it offers great attraction to use the
phased array antenna system for this purpose. A document "RADARS,
Volume 7, CW and DOPPLER RADAR - David K. BARTON, Consulting
Scientist Raytheon Company Bedford, Mass." discloses a phased array
antenna system designated for realising radar transmissions and also
suitable for illumination of selected targets.The present invention is thereto characterised in that the phased array
antenna system is also designed for the periodical illumination of selected
targets for the guidance of missiles during their flight to the selected targets.Although the missiles have been designed to operate with an uninterrupted
CW illumination of the target, periodical illumination of the target has proven
to be sufficient. A problem which may be encountered in the event of a
plurality of missiles being simultaneously deployed, is
that the permissible duty cycle of the phased array antenna
system is exceeded. Solutions to this problem depend on the
type of phased array antenna to be used. For a passive
phased array antenna system, the solution will generally
imply the incorporation of an additional transmission
system which enables the required duty cycle. For an active
phased array antenna system, it is for instance possible to
reduce the current and voltage of the solid-state module
output stages, as is known from patent specification US-A
5,155,492.In addition to said target illumination, an illuminator is
also capable of generating a CW reference signal for the
missile during its flight to the selected

Phased array antenna system provided with a phased array antenna for generating a
pencil beam, designated for realising radar transmission, the phased array antenna system

being also suitable for the illumination of selected targets for the guidance of missiles during
their flight towards the selected targets, the illumination of the targets being periodical and

the targets being illuminated alternately,
characterized in that
 radar transmissions occur between the periodical illuminations of the
selected targets, with a number of radar transmissions of a certain duration occuring between

these illumination periods.
Phased array antenna system as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that

the phased array antenna system (1) also comprises at least one auxiliary
array for the periodical transmission of reference signals (8, 9) for the

missiles during their flight.
Phased array antenna system as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised in that

the at least one auxiliary array has a relatively wide antenna diagram in the
horizontal plane and a relatively narrow antenna diagram in the vertical

plane.
Phased array antenna system as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised in that

the reference signal (8, 9) for a missile has the same frequency as the signal
generated by the phased array antenna for the periodical illumination of the

associated selected target (2).
Phased array antenna system as claimed in claim 4, 
characterised in that

the at least one auxiliary array at least substantially simultaneously transmits
the reference signals (8, 9) whenever a selected target is illuminated.
Phased array antenna system as claimed in claim 4 or 5,

 the reference signals (8, 9) are also at least substantially simultaneously
transmitted whenever the phased array antenna realizes a radar
