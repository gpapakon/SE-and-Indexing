<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for transferring load carriers between conveyor tracks arranged at an angle to one another. The device has at least one guide element, movable by means of a drive into the conveying path of the load carriers on the first conveyor track and in the direction of the second conveyor track, for transferring the load carriers into the second conveyor track. In order to allow a reliable transfer of the load carriers, at the same time with a high transfer capacity, it is proposed that the guide element be designed as a driver (7) which, for the transfer operation, can be moved positively into a recess (groove 14) arranged on the load carrier (4).
