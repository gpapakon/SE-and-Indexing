<ABSTRACT>
Light aggregate for use as inert material in a concrete 
composition, comprising a mix of: ground diatomaceous rock 

making up 85-95% by weight of the mix; a melting additive 
(A) (2.5-7.5% by weight) and an expander additive (B) 

(1.5-10.5% by weight); this mix is made up with water, 
transformed into granules and heat-treated at between 1100 

and 1250°C for a period of between 5 and 25 minutes. 
Both the melting additive (A) and the expander additive (B) can be 
wastes from the secondary processing of aluminum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aggregates for 
structural concrete compositions for building construction, 
in particular light aggregates for light-weight 
concrete compositions. For a long time, it has been clear to experts in 
the field that it was necessary to develop so-called 
"light" concretes, that is to say light-weight 
concretes, as distinct from commonly used concretes. The 
latter consist of compositions of hydraulic binder, 
generally cement, water and inert, generally sand or 
gravel, which are largely used in both civil and 
industrial construction, the volumetric mass of which is 
normally about 2400 kg/m³. Normally, if the lightening of a concrete consists 
solely in reducing the weight of the inert contained in 
the mix, this type of operation leads to a significant 
deterioration in the mechanical strength. The principal 
problem to be solved is the necessity of obtaining a 
product which has a lower density but mechanical properties 
which are hardly varied with respect to the 
material traditionally used.  Such results are very difficult to check in the 
case of the solutions adopted by the state of the art, 
which in most cases give materials which reach extremely 
low densities, but at the expense of the mechanical 
properties. It is clear that concretes of this type are 
not in fact suitable for structural use. The product LIEVOCEM (registered name) made by 
Levocell S.p.A. consists of a composition which, in 
addition to the said hydraulic binder and inert, 
combined with water, contains a foam obtained with 
organic surfactants. The presence of this foam allows 
the formation of microbubbles in the interior of the 
concrete; the product thus obtained has extremely low 
densities, of the order of 300-800 kg/m³, but also has 
on the other hand compressive strengths of 15-25 
kgf/cm². With such properties, the material cited above 
cannot safely be used for structural purposes. A result of analogous type is also obtained with 
the product NEOPOR (registered name) made by Neopor-Verfahrenstechnik 
GmbH, which consists in the use of a 
surfactant which, via a complex preparation system, 
allows a concrete of low density to be produced. The 
mechanical properties, even though better than those of 
the products cited before, are nevertheless strongly 
linked to the density of the concrete obtained, of the 
order of 80 kgf/cm² for a density of 1200 kg/m³. In this 
case too a structural use of the concrete produced by 
such a method is somewhat debatable. As distinct from the two
