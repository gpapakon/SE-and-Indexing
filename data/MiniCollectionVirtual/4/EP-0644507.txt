<ABSTRACT>
In the manufacture of a chip-card module (M), a curable casting compound (6) is applied at least onto the lines (5) which connect at least one IC module (4) applied to a flat carrier (1) to contact points provided on the carrier (1). The casting compound (6) is covered over, on that side facing away from the IC module (4), by means of a pressed-on covering wafer (7) fixed by means of the casting compound (6). A device (V) for the passivation of modules (M) has at least one positioning element (P, 12) for pressing the covering wafer (7) onto the casting compound (6), which is present either on the covering wafer (7) or on the module (4) in a still deformable state. In the chip-card module (M), a predetermined module thickness is maintained by means of the covering wafer (7) fixed in the casting compound (6).

Method of manufacturing a chip-card module (M), wherein
a curable encapsulating material (6) is applied to at least

the lines (5) connecting at least one IC module (4) attached
to a substrate (1) to contact pads provided on the substrate,


characterized in that
 the thickness of the encapsulating
material (6) is established prior to curing on that side of

the IC module (4) that faces away from the substrate (1) by
means of a cover platelet (7) which is pressed onto the

encapsulating material.
Method as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
encapsulating material (6) is applied to the bottom surface

of the cover platelet (7) and the encapsulating material (6)
including the cover platelet (7) is pressed onto the

substrate (1) and the IC module (4) without any need for
postprocessing.
Method as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
encapsulating material (6) is applied to the IC module (4)

and the substrate (1) and the cover platelet (7) is pressed
onto the substrate (1) and the IC module (4) without any need

for postprocessing.
Method as claimed in at least one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the encapsulating material (6) is
spread up to over the peripery of the cover platelet (7) by

applying pressure onto the latter.
Method as claimed in at least one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the cover platelet (7) is pressed into

the encapsulating material (6) only to such an extent that
the free upper surface of the cover platelet lies above the 

encapsulating material (6) spread over the periphery of the
cover platelet (7).
Method as claimed in at least one of Claims 1 to 5,

characterized by
 the following steps:

the cover platelet (7) is punched out and grasped,
the grasped cover platelet (7) is wetted with
encapsulating material (6) on one surface thereof;
the grasped and wetted cover platelet (7) is pressed
onto the bonded substrate (1) equipped with the IC module

(4); and
the encapsulating material (6) is cured, the cover
platelet (7) being released either before or after curing.
Method as claimed in at least one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that
 the encapsulating material (6) is
heated to a temperature of preferably no more than 60Â°C.
Method as claimed in at least one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 the cover platelet (7) is pressed on in
such a way that bond wires forming the lines (5) connecting

the IC module (4) to the contact pads (3, 2) are enveloped
and the bond pads are enclosed, with the encapsulating

material (6) centred on the IC module (4), and no deeper than
until they rest on the bond wires.
Device for manufacturing chip-card modules (M) with a
curable encapsulating material (6), comprising an

encapsulation station for applying the encapsulating material
onto a level substrate (1) of each chip-card module (M),


characterized in that
 a substrate transfer distance (D)
including at least one work station (S) is provided for at

least one substrate (1) fixed in its location for
passivation, 
in that
 a rotatable stand (26) for synchronously
moving several cover platelet locating elements (P, 12) along 

a circular trajectory intersecting the work station (S) is
provided, 
in that
 a cover platelet supply station (30) and an
encapsulation station (28) are provided on the circular

trajectory, and 
in that
 driving means for height adjusting
the cover platelet positioning elements (P, 12) on the stand

(26) relative to a predefined location are provided, with the
thickness of the encapsulating material (6) being established

prior to curing on that side of the IC module (4) which faces
away from the substrate (1) by means of the cover platelet

(7) pressed onto the encapsulating material (6).
Device as claimed in Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 a
cover platelet punching device (31) is provided in the cover

platelet supply station (30).
Device as claimed in Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 a
precision measuring spindle (39) is provided for adjusting

the predefined lowered location of each cover platelet
locating element (P, 12).
