<ABSTRACT>
A gearing and drive mechanism is provided for a construction toy system, in which a coherent structure can be assembled from a series of rod-like struts (25, 26, 27, 28) and hub-like connectors (11), wherein the struts have specially contoured ends engageable by lateral, snap-in assembly with pairs of contoured gripping arms on the connector elements. Upon snap-in assembly, the struts are effectively rigidly joined with the connectors. Spur gears (71) and pinions (70) can be rotatably supported in the structure using struts and connector elements providing a gear train for converting the output of a motor (37) to the driving of an element of the construction toy system. The construction system has a graduated progression of strut lengths, such that a first length is of a size to form a base of an isosceles right triangle for which the next length of the progression is of a size to form a hypothenuse. Spur and pinion gears have a size ratio of approximately 2.4 at the pitch diameter to accommodate assembly, in structures of connected struts provided in such a size progression, of useful drive gear mechanisms of various speed ratios and mechanical advantages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject matter of this application is related to
U.S. Patent No. 5,199,919, granted April 6, 1993, and to
U.S. Patent No. 5,137,486, granted August 11, 1992, and to
U.S. Patent No. 5,061,219, granted October 29, 1991.The above mentioned patents disclose a novel form of
construction toy system which is comprised of a plurality
of rod-like strut elements and a plurality of hub-like
connector elements. While reference should be made to the
prior patent documents themselves for full details of the
disclosure the earlier documents deal generally with a
novel form of strut and connector which are configured to
allow lateral, snap-in assembly of the strut ends into
sockets formed in the connector elements by pairs of
gripping arms. The ends of the strut elements, and the
gripping arms of the connector elements are contoured such
that, when the parts are snapped together, the struts are
gripped and held firmly against both axial and lateral
movement in relation to the connector elements. This
unique configuration of parts, as explained in the above
mentioned patents, enables the construction of complex,
coherent skeletal structures.Many of the structures possible to assemble using the
struts and connectors of the above-mentioned patents can
involve moving parts. By way of example only, it is
possible to construct ferris wheels, carrousels, elevators,
cranes and the like, all providing for driven motion of
certain components. An advantageous and highly simplified
motor mount structure can be incorporated into a coherent 
structure, assembled from struts and connector elements the
above-mentioned U.S. patents, to in effect form part of
such structures and enabling convenient, motor-controlled
operation of movable elements of such structures. The
lateral spacing between the respective tubular guide
members of the motor mount corresponds precisely to the
center-to-center spacing of a pair of connector elements
joined by a strut element of standard length oriented
transversely of the axis of the tubular guide members and
engaging connector element assemblies to which the struts,
supporting the motor mount, are engaged.Associated with the motor mount arrangement is a
series of gears, arranged in a novel manner to be driven
by an electric motor carried in the motor mount, and
adapted to be supported by standard strut elements,
utilized throughout the construction toy system, and by the
use of standard connector elements used throughout the
construction toy system. The gears are adapted to be
mounted for free
