<ABSTRACT>
A feed for domestic fowls which comprises an indigestible 
dextrin prepared by roasting a starch in the presence of a 

mineral acid to give a pyrodextrin and treating the pyrodextrin 
with α-amylase or an indigestible dextrin prepared by further 

treating the α-amylase-treated product with glucoamylase, 
followed by filtration, purification and separation and removal 

of digestible fractions of the product through chromatography 
using an ion exchange resin. The feed serves to inhibit the 

formation of fatty liver, to improve the meat quality and the 
rate of egg laying, to improve the eggshell strength and to 

reduce the cholesterol content in the egg.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a feed for domestic fowls
and more specifically to a feed for domestic fowls which can
inhibit the formation of fatty liver and can in turn improve
the meat quality and which permits the reduction in the content
of cholesterol in eggs and can improve the egg-laying rate and
the eggshell strength.It has been a recent tendency to make the formula feeds
for fowls more thick (so-called thickened feeds) or increase the
content of proteins and make them calorific for the improvement
of the efficiency thereof. Thus, fowls take energy more than
the required energy intake and accordingly, there is a sign of
frequent incidence of abnormalities in lipometabolism such as
excess accumulation of fats in, for instance, peritoneal
cavity, intestinal tracts and hypodermis or formation of fatty
liver. This accordingly leads to reduction in the performance
of meat production (inclusive of viscus meat) in case of the
chicken breed and reduction in the egg-laying rate and in the
rate of cracked eggs due to reduction in the eggshell strength
in case of the egg breed.Recently, eating habits have been improved and on the 
other hand, the diseases of adult people have become a matter of
great concern, in particular, arterial scleroses have widely
and deeply been recognized. Cholesterols derived from foods have
been known as causative substances of arterial scleroses.
Recent investigations have proved that there is a positive
correlation between the quantity of cholesterols taken in the
form of foods and the content thereof in the serum. Moreover, it
has also been recognized that a positive correlation is
observed between the quantity of cholesterols taken in the form
of foods and the mortality rate of cardiopathy due to arterial
scleroses and it has been proved that the mortality rate of
cardiopathy due to arterial scleroses increases as the amount of
cholesterols taken in the form of foods increases.The fowl egg is a typical example of foods having high
contents of cholesterols. The amounts of various foods taken
and the mortality rate of cardiopathy were examined on adult
male persons of 55 to 59-year-old and it was proved that there
was a significant positive correlation between the amount of
fowl egg-intake and the mortality rate of cardiopathy (r =
0.666). Nevertheless, the fowl egg is an excellent nutrient
substance as a source of high quality protein, is a food
desirably taken at least one per day and accordingly, there has
been desired for the development of a technique capable of
reducin

in eggs and improving the egg-laying rate and the eggshell strength in the

preparation of a feed for domestic fowls.
Use according to claim 1 wherein the indigestible dextrin is
obtainable by roasting a starch in the presence of a mineral acid to give a

pyrodextrin and treating the pyrodextrin with α-amylase.
Use according to claim 2 wherein the content of the indigestible
dextrin ranges from 0.2 to 10 % by weight.
Use according to claim 2 or 3 wherein the content of indigestible
components in the indigestible dextrin ranges from 40 to 60 % by weight.
Use according to one of claims 2 to 4 wherein the mineral acid is
hydrochloric acid.
Use according to claim 1 wherein the indigestible dextrin is
obtainable by roasting a starch in the presence of a mineral acid to give a

pyrodextrin, treating the pyrodextrin with α-amylase, and then with
glucoamylase, filtering and purifying the product, and then separating and

removing a digestible fraction from the product through chromatography with
an ion exchange resin.
Use according to claim 6 wherein the content of indigestible
components in the indigestible dextrin ranges from 50 to 90 % by weight.
Use according to claim 6 or 7 wherein the content of the indigestible
dextrin ranges from 0.1 to 5 % by weight. 
Use according to one of claims 6 to 8 wherein the pyrodextrin is
treated with glucoamylase containing a small amount of α-amylase.
Use according to one of claims 6 to 9 wherein the ion exchange resin
is a strongly acidic cation exchange resin which is converted into an alkali or

alkaline earth metal form prior to use.
