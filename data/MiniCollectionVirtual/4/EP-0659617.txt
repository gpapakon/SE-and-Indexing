<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle occupant restraint apparatus (10) includes 
an inflatable vehicle occupant restraint (12) supported on 

the vehicle door (16). The door (16) has a detachable 
inner trim panel section (32) with an outer side surface 

(42) that partly defines the occupant compartment (20). 
The apparatus further includes a source of inflation fluid 

(14) and a manifold (52) for directing inflation fluid from 
the source (14) into the restraint (12) to inflate the 

restraint (12). The detachable inner trim panel section 
(32) of the door (16) is a panel portion of the restraint 

(12) which moves into the occupant compartment (20) upon 
inflation of the restraint (12), and has an inner side 

surface (40) for contacting the inflation fluid directed 
into the restraint (12). The inner side surface (40) of 

the panel portion of the restraint (12) partly defines the 
volume enclosed within the restraint (12) when the 

restraint (12) is inflated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inflatable vehicle
occupant restraint of the kind defined in the preamble of Claim 1
and disclosed for instance in JP-A-02 249 740. It particularly relates to such an
inflatable vehicle occupant restraint which is inflated
upon the occurrence of a side impact collision.An inflatable vehicle occupant restraint, such as an
air bag, is inflated when the vehicle experiences a
collision. Inflation fluid is then directed to flow from a
source of inflation fluid into the restraint to inflate the
restraint. The inflation fluid expands the restraint from
a stored condition to an inflated condition in which the
restraint extends into the vehicle occupant compartment.
When the restraint is thus inflated into the occupant
compartment, it restrains an occupant from forcefully
striking parts of the vehicle.Such an inflatable vehicle occupant restraint is
concealed from the occupant compartment when it is stored.
A deployment door typically extends over the restraint to 
conceal the restraint from the occupant compartment. The
force of the inflation fluid flowing into the restraint is
directed against the deployment door to open and move the
deployment door out of the path of the restraint when the
restraint is inflated and moved into the occupant
compartment. The deployment door is normally formed as a
portion of the vehicle part in which the restraint is
stored. In certain applications, the deployment door may
be formed as a portion of the steering wheel, instrument
panel, or vehicle door, depending upon the location of the
restraint in the vehicle. If the restraint is to be
inflated upon the occurrence of a side impact collision,
the restraint and the deployment door will often be located
on a vehicle door. JP-A-02 249 740, summarized in Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol.
14, No. 575 (M-1062), discloses an energy absorbing structure
for a car body side. To efficiently absorb energy of an impact
load acting on a car body side by inflating and spreading, when
the impact load not less than a predetermined value in the
lateral direction of the car body is applied, an impact
absorber is arranged in a condition that is folded and housed
in a side door. In a deployment situation an air tank supplies
air into an airbag forming a peripheral edge part of a spread
member consisting of soft material. The airbag spreads also in
a car body width for absorbing energy by releasing connection
of a fixed supporting member for connecting the internal
surface of the airbag to an airbag cover.DE-A-42 17

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for restraining an occupant of a vehicle
occupant compartment (210), said apparatus comprising:


a vehicle part (16; 24) having a detachable panel section
(304, 402),
an inflatable vehicle occupant restraint (300; 400), said restraint
being inflatable into an inflated condition in which said

restraint extends into the occupant compartment (20);
a source of inflation fluid; and
means (62) for directing inflation fluid from said source into
said restraint to inflate said restraint;
said detachable panel section of said vehicle part having an
outer side surface for partly defining the occupant

compartment;
said inflatable vehicle occupant restraint (12) being supported
on said vehicle part (16; 24), said restraint having an air

bag portion which moves into an inflated condition extending
from said vehicle part (16; 24) into the occupant compartment

(20) upon inflation of said restraint;
said restraint further having a panel portion (26) which
comprises said detachable panel section (304, 402) of said

vehicle part, said panel portion (26) of said restraint (12)
being fixed to said air bag portion of said restraint to move

from said vehicle part with said air bag portion of said
restraint,

characterised in that said air bag portion is divided into distinct
air bag sections (312, 314, 316; 412,

414, 416) which are separated from each other, said air bag sections
adjoining respective panel sections (318, 320, 322) of said panel

portion (304, 402) and separately applying different fluid pressure
forces to said respective panel sections;
said air bag sections (312) communicating with a source of inflation
fluid to receive inflation fluid from said source upon

inflation of said restraint, the different fluid pressures in the
distinct air bag sections being controlled.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said sections of said
air bag portion having elongated tubular shapes, are separated

into distinct sections by a plurality of mounting rods (310,410) which 
extend longitudinally between said sections of said air bag

portion.
Apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said panel portion (304)
of said restraint (300) has an inner side surface (308) for contacting

said inflation fluid directed into said restraint (300), said inner
side surface (308) thus partly defining the volume enclosed within

said restraint when said restraint is inflated.
Apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said air bag
portion of said restraint (400) defines the entire volume enclosed

within said restraint (400) when said restraint is inflated.
Apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said detachable
panel section (304, 402) of said vehicle part is detachable entirely from

said vehicle part and is moved to a location spaced from said
vehicle part upon inflation of said restraint.
Apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein said vehicle part
is a vehicle door having an inner trim panel, said detachable

panel section (304,402) of said vehicle part being a detachable section
of said inner trim panel.
Apparatus as defined in claim 1 further comprising means
for sensing the occurrence of a side impact vehicle collision

and means for causing inflation fluid to be emitted from said
source in response to a sensed side impact vehicle collision.
