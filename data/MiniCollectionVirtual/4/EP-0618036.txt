<CLAIMS>
A process for laser beam machining wherein the 
laser beam is tran
smitted towards one side of a wall (4) of an 
article (6) to be machined and issues from the other side of 

the wall after machining, characterised in that a disc (16) 
which is opaque to the laser beam is disposed on said other 

side of the wall in the path of the issuing laser beam and is 
rotated so as to stop the issuing laser beam and thus protect 

the walls (8) adjacent the machined wall from impingement by 
the issuing laser beam. 
A laser beam machining device comprising means (12) 
for producing the laser beam and transmitting it towards one 

side of a wall (4) of an article (6) to be machined, the 
laser beam issuing from the other side of the wall after 

machining, characterised in that it also comprises a disc 
(16) which is opaque to the laser beam and which is adapted to 

be disposed on said other side of the wall in the path of the 
issuing laser beam, and means (18) for rotating the disc so as 

to stop the issuing laser beam and thus protect the walls (8) 
adjacent the machined wall from impingement by the issuing 

laser beam. 
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the speed of rotation of the disc (16) is chosen in the range 

of from 10 000 to 100 000 revolutions per minute. 
A device according to any of claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the diameter of the disc (16) is chosen 

in the range of from 10 to 80 mm.  
 
A device according to any of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that the thickness of the disc (16) is at 

least 0.4 mm. 
A device according to any of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the disc (16) is made of a material 

chosen from the group comprising polytetrafluoroethylene, 
aluminium, copper, molybdenum, tungsten carbide, martensitic 

stainless steel, austenitic stainless steel, nickel-based 
alloys, cobalt-based alloys, titanium or the constituent 

material of the article (6) to be machined.
