<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a laminate for packaging 
photographic or radiographic films. 
The packaging comprises a heat-sealable component 
associated with a polyester film covered with a deposit of 

silicon dioxide. 
This packaging is completely recyclable and has 
characteristics suitable for packaging silver halide 

photographic or radiographic films.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns the packaging of photographic and 
radiographic products. Various composite materials, hereinafter referred to as 
laminates, have been proposed for packaging photographic or 
radiographic products. One of these types of packaging is 
a complex made of polyethylene covered with a film of 
metallised polyester. In particular such packaging enables 
radiographic products with an incorporated screen to be 
vacuum packed by heat sealing. The characteristics which a 
laminate for packaging photographic or radiographic 
products must have are imperviousness (to light and 
moisture in particular), suitability for heat sealing, 
strength (mechanical resistance to tearing) and, of course, 
the absence of interaction with the photographic or 
radiographic product packaged using this laminate. The 
imperviousness of laminates based on metallised polyester 
is sometimes uncertain, as a result of variations in the 
quality of the polyester and/or of the metallic coating on 
the polyester. Generally speaking, the characteristics 
listed above represent so many constraints on the choice 
and the production of the packaging laminate. In addition 
to these, there has for some time now been a further 
constraint, resulting from concerns associated with 
environmental protection. Packaging now has to be 
recyclable without excessive difficulty. However, a 
laminate containing metallised polyester as a component 
poses a problem in this respect because of the presence of 
a metal. It is therefore desirable that recyclable packaging should 
be available for photographic and radiographic products, 
without for all that sacrificing the characteristics which  
 
are necessary in other respects, such as imperviousness, 
strength or dimensional stability. The object of the present invention is to resolve this 
problem by proposing a recyclable laminate which can be 
used for packaging a photographic or radiographic product 
and which comprises successively, starting from the inside 
face, (a) a polymeric component suitable for heat sealing, 
(b) a barrier layer comprising on an inorganic pigment 
obtained by vapor disposition and, (c) a polyester-based 
component. The word "inside face" refers to the face of 
the packaging which, after folding and heat sealing, will 
be in contact with the photographic film. An intermediate 
layer comprising a bonding agent may be disposed between 
the polyester component and the heat-sealable component. 
At least one of these components is opaque, so as to 
prevent
