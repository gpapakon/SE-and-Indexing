<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
spinning silk fibers. More specifically, the invention 
involves forming silk fibers by dissolving silk fibroin 
in an aqueous salt solution, removing the salt from the 
solution, followed by removal of the water, and 
redissolution of the resulting regenerated silk in 
hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) to produce a fiber-spinnable 
solution. The solution can be spun and drawn 
to produce high-quality fibers with near-native silk 
properties having greater mechanical strength. Silk fibroin (silkworm silk) is a naturally 
occurring polypeptide which occurs in fibrous form 
having high strength and a soft hand. The nature of 
silk fibroin makes it suitable for a wide range of uses 
including textile applications and in suture materials. 
Silk has been used as a suture material since ancient 
times. Because silkworms produce filaments in only one 
size (ca. 1 denier), twisted or braided yarns must be 
used when loads exceed a few grams. Unfortunately, the 
interstices of a multifilament yarn can be a route for 
infection. Thus, it would be desirable to be able to 
produce silk fibers in deniers other than those found in 
nature which would be suitable for such applications as 
monofilament sutures. Fibroin is known to be soluble in certain high 
ionic strength aqueous salt solutions, for example, 
aqueous lithium thiocyanate (LiSCN), sodium thiocyanate  
 
(NaSCN), calcium thiocyanate (Ca(SCN)₂), magnesium 
thiocyanate (Mg(SCN)₂), calcium chloride (CaCl₂), 
lithium bromide (LiBr), zinc chloride (ZnCl₂), magnesium 
chloride (MgCl₂), and copper salts, such as copper 
nitrate (Cu(NO₃)₂), copper ethylene diamine 
(Cu(NH₂CH₂CH₂NH₂)₂(OH)₂), and Cu(NH₃)₄(OH)₂. It has 
long been known that the salts can be dialyzed out of 
such aqueous salt/fibroin solutions to produce aqueous 
solutions of fibroin which are similar in some ways to 
the liquid contents of a silkworm's silk gland. Fibers 
have been spun from aqueous fibroin solutions of this 
type, but more commonly, the solutions have been used to 
cast films for structure studies. For example, Bhat and Ahirrao, Journal of 
Polymer Science, Vol. 21, pp. 1273-1280 (1983) describe 
the dissolution of silk fibers in 70% lithium 
thiocyanate solution and regenerating the dissolved silk 
by casting films from the solution after dialyzing. 
They found that the cast films were amorphous and could 
be transformed to a beta-sheet form using a variety of 
methods. Those skilled in the art have attempted to find 
suitable solvents

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing silk fibroin fibers, 
comprising the steps of: 


a) forming a silk fibroin solution comprising 
silk fibroin in an aqueous salt solution;

solution to form a silk fibroin material; 
c) forming a fiber-spinnable solution comprising 
5 to 25 % by weight of the silk fibroin material 

in hexafluoroisopropanol; and 
d) extruding the fiber-spinnable solution 
through a spinneret.
