<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a portable container for transporting plates intended for manufacturing flat screens. It comprises a case (10) which houses a cassette (30) and can be closed by a cover (20). The cassette (30) is provided with two mutually parallel plane webs (31 and 32, 93 and 94) whose opposing faces are respectively provided with mutually parallel grooves corresponding pairwise between one web and the other so as to be able to receive the plates slidably. The webs (31 and 32, 93 and 94) are held apart by means of bracings (33, 34, 35, 91, 92).

A portable container for the transport of glass plates intended for the manufacture of 

flat screens, of a type comprising a case (10) accommodating a cassette (30), which can 
be closed by a cover (20), the said cassette (30) being provided with two flat flanges (31 

and 32, 93 and 94), parallel to one another, the faces of which are, in relation to one 
another, provided with grooves (36), parallel to one another, and corresponding two by 

two from one flange to the other, in such a way as to be able to accommodate the sliding 
movement of the said plates, the said flanges (31 and 32, 93 and 94) being kept at a 

distance from one another by means of spacer elements (33, 34, 35, 91, 92), 
characterised in that the said flanges are entirely comprised of a self-lubricating material 

in order to avoid the glass plates which are to be transported from adhering to the 
grooves (36) and vice-versa. 
A container according to Claim 1, characterised in that the said self-lubricating 
material is a polyoxymethylene acetal. 
A container according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised in that the said 
cassette (30) consists of a box (90a) and a cover (90b) provided to close it, the said 

flanges (93, 94) being mounted on the interior of the said bx (90a). 
A container according to Claim 3, characterised in that the said cassette (30) is 
provided with cross-members (91. 92) fixed on the large walls of the box (90a), the said 

cross- members (91, 92) being provided in order to allow for the placement of the said 
flanges (93, 94) by sliding between their ends and the small walls of the box (90a). 
A container according to Claims 3 or 4, characterised in that the cassette (30) 
normally rests on the base of the case (10) by means of a flexible plug element (100). 
A container according to one of Claims 3 or 4, characterised in that the plug elements 
(101, 102) are provided in the cover (20) in such a way that, when the cover (20) closes  

 
off the case (10), the cassette is sealed by the said plug elements (101, 102). 
A container according to one of Claims 3 to 6, characterised in that the said box (90a) 
and the cover (90b) are made of an inactinic material. 
A container according to Claim 7, characterised in that the said inactinic material is an 
inactinic polymethyl (meth)acrylate. 
A container according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised in that the base of 
the said cassette (30, 90) is provided with flexible plug elements (103, 80) on which rest 

the plates which are located on the flanges (31 and 32, 93 and 94), and in which the plug 
elements (70, 104) are provided in order to provide a force in support of the said plates 

which have been loaded in position, when the cover (20) closes the case (10) or when the 
cassette (10) is closed by the cover (90b).
