<ABSTRACT>
Filtering device for the clarification of liquids, especially of industrial or effluent water, of the type comprising an open tank provided with a floor with nozzles supporting the filter bed, side chutes for the delivery of the raw water, a gutter for discharging filtered water, means for lifting the material from the filter and an axial gutter for discharging the washing water, this device being characterised in that the bottom of the filter, under the floor (12) is separated along its lengthwise axis by a leakproof partition (20) bounding two independent cells (14, 15 - 14' - 15') in the filter.

Filter device for the clarification of liquids, notably of industrial
effluents or waste waters, of the type comprising an open-topped

tank provided with a perforated floor supporting the filter
bed, lateral channels for the infeed of the raw water, a discharge

channel for the filtered water, means for washing the material of
the filter and an axial discharge channel for the washing waters,

this device being characterized in that the base of the filter,
beneath the floor (12), is divided along its longitudinal axis by

a leaktight partition (20) defining, in the filter, two independent
cells (15, 15').
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that each cell of the
filter comprises an inlet for the washing water and an inlet for

washing air (22, 22') and also a regulator valve.
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized
in that it comprises only a single washing pump, this being equipped

with a valve for the distribution of the washing water between the
two cells of the filter.
Device according to any one of the preceding Claims, characterized
in that the feed channels for water to be filtered (18, 18'), disposed

laterally along the filter tank, are designed in such a manner
as to assure a dual function:


a uniform distribution of the water to be treated along the entire
length of each cell of the filter during the filtration phase, and
a uniform distribution of the scavenging water, used during the
washing phase of the filter.
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in that each feed channel
(18, 18') comprises a lower wall (26, 26'), inclined towards the

interior of the tank and comprising calibrated orifices (27, 27')
and it is continued upwards by a vertical wall (28, 28') provided

with orifices (29, 29'), the raw water to be filtered being 
introduced through the orifices (27, 27', 29, 29') of the

inclined and vertical walls, but the scavenging water being
introduced, during washing of the cell concerned, through the

intermediary of the lower orifices (27, 27') provided in the
inclined walls (26, 26').
