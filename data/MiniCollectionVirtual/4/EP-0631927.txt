<ABSTRACT>
A three wheeled vehicle has two wheels (16) in front 
with front wheel drive, and a single rear wheel (28) and 

rear wheel steering. A steering linkage 
(30,38,40,76,78,58) causes the vehicle to steer with 

directionally conventional response to a steering wheel 
input (26). A rear axle assembly (112) (see Figure 3A) 

provides uncomplicated construction accommodating both 
the steering link (58) and a spring (96) and shock 

absorber (118) type suspension. The axle (112) moves 
vertically within inner tube (92) and is constrained 

against rotation by rods (114,104). The inner tube (92) 
is coupled to steering arm (58) and rotates within outer 

tube (60).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a three wheeled vehicle, 
and more particularly to a three wheeled powered vehicle 
having two axles with steering mechanism controlling 
either axle while a suspension member is incorporated 
with at least one steering component. Three wheeled vehicles having one rear and two front 
wheels are known. U.S. 4,020,914, issued to Wolfgang 
Trautwein on 3rd May, 1977; 4,448,278 issued to William 
J. Badsey on 15th May 1984; 4787470 issued to William J. 
Badsey on 29th November, 1988, are representative, each 
disclosing three wheeled vehicles steered from the front 
wheels and driven from the rear wheel. U.S. 4,703,824 
issued to Shoichiro Irimajiri et al on 3rd November, 
1987, discloses a three wheeled vehicle both steered and 
driven from the front. Many advantages accrue from the concept of the three 
wheeled vehicle. However, cost of manufacture and 
repair and expense of operation are of paramount 
importance in personal transport vehicles. This is 
especially true of second vehicles, for which the 
decision of an owner on whether to buy may rest almost  
 
exclusively on purchase price and maintenance costs. While each of the above inventions addresses a 
specific need or engineering concept, this is done from 
an engineering perspective, and simplicity of the device 
and other economies arising from the design may be 
neglected. Therefore a need exists for an uncomplicated 
and economical three wheeled vehicle as provided for by 
this invention. None of the above disclosures, taken 
either singly or in combination, is seen to describe the 
instant invention as claimed. According to this invention there is provided a 
three-wheeled vehicle comprising a pair of spaced front 
wheels mounted on a driven axle assembly, and a single 
rear wheel, characterised in that the rear wheel is 
carried by an axle assembly attached to 
including spring means and shock absorbing means disposed 
within inner and outer concentric members, the inner and 
outer concentric members being mechanically linked one to 
another whereby the members rotate together while 
permitting said inner concentric member to be axially 
displaced while said outer concentric member is axially 
fixed with steering means being affixed to one 
concentric member. According to this invention there is further 
provided a three wheeled vehicle including first and  
 
second axles mounted thereon, at opposite ends thereof, 
two wheels mounted on the one axle and one wheel mounted 
upon the other axle, power means and a

A three-wheeled vehicle (10) comprises a pair of 
spaced front wheels (16) mounted on a driven axle 

assembly (14), and a single rear wheel (28), 
characterised in that the rear wheel (28) is carried by 

an axle assembly (112) attached to suspension means (88) 
including spring means (96) and shock absorbing means 

(118) disposed within inner and outer concentric members 
(84,92), the inner and outer concentric members (84,92) 

being mechanically linked one to another whereby the 
members rotate together while permitting said inner 

concentric member (84) to be axially displaced while said 
outer concentric member (92) is axially fixed with 

steering means (58) being affixed to one concentric 
member (92). 
A three wheeled vehicle (10) including first (14) 
and second (62) axles mounted thereon at opposite ends 

thereof, two wheels (16) mounted on the one axle (14) and 
one wheel (28) mounted upon the other axle (62), power 

means (18) and a seat (12) disposed within said vehicle, 
transmission means (20) operably connecting said power 

means (18) to at least one wheel (16,28) to drive same, 
suspension means (25,88) mounted on the vehicle and 

 
connecting the wheels (16,28) thereto, steering means 

(26) mounted on the vehicle and controlling the steering 
of at least one wheel (16,28), characterised by:- 

   the steering means (26) being attached to suspension 
means (88) attached to a wheel (28) with the suspension 

means (88) including spring means (96) and shock 
absorbing means (118) disposed within inner and outer 

concentric members (84,92), the inner and outer 
concentric members (84,92) being mechanically linked one

permitting said inner concentric member (84) to be 

axially displaced while said outer concentric member (92) 
is axially fixed with steering means (58) being affixed 

to one concentric member (92), and further characterised 
by:- 

   the one axle (62) being provided with both 
suspension means (88) and steered wheel (28) which may be 

vertically displaced relative to the vehicle while 
maintaining a portion of the weight of the vehicle 

supported on the wheel and allowing unimpeded steering
