<ABSTRACT>
A metallic honeycombed body has an axis (1) and a conical tubular envelope (2) with respect to the axis (2) into which is fitted an arrangement of at least one stack (3) wound around the axis (1) in the manner of an involute. The stack (3) has a plurality of tiered metal sheets (4, 5), including a plurality of corrugated metal sheets (5). Each metal sheet (4, 5) is designed as a ring segment and is delimited by an outer arc (7) approximately circular with respect to a central point (6), as well as by an approximately circular inner arc (8) concentric with respect to the outer arc (7) and located between the outer arc and the central point (6). Each corrugated metal sheet (5) has corrugations that are approximately radially oriented with respect to the central point (6) and have a determined height (h1, h2) in each arc (7, 8). The arcs (7, 8) have lengths (s1, s2) whose ratio is approximately the same as the ratio between the corresponding corrugation heights (h1, h2). This honeycombed body is particularly suitable as a support for a catalyst in the exhaust system of an internal combustion engine that drives a motor vehicle, for example, and is associated as a "pre-catalyst" to an usual, axially straight honeycombed body with a catalyst.

A honeycomb body having an axis (1) and a casing tube (2) 
which is conical with respect thereto, characterised in that fitted 

therein is an arrangement comprising at least one stack (3) which is 
wound around the axis (1) in the manner of an involute, which stack 

(3) has a multiplicity of sheets (4, 5) which are laid one upon the 
other, a majority of corrugated sheets (5) being included therein, 

each sheet (4, 5) being formed in the manner of a segment of a 
circular ring so that it is defined by an outer arc (7) which is 

approximately circular with respect to a centre point (6) and an 
approximately circular inner arc (8) which is concentric with respect 

to the outer arc and which is disposed between same and the centre 
point (6), and each corrugated sheet (5) having corrugations (9), each 

of which is oriented approximately radially with respect to the centre 
point (6) and has at each arc (7, 8) an associated corrugation height 

(h1, h2), wherein the arcs (7, 8) are of lengths (s1, s2) whose ratio 
is approximately equal to the ratio of the respective associated 

corrugation heights (h1, h2). 
A honeycomb body according to claim 1 wherein in each 
corrugated sheet (5) the corrugation heights (h1, h2) of the 

corrugations (9) merge into each other steadily and preferably 
linearly. 
A honeycomb body according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein each 
corrugation (9) at the outer arc (7) goes into a single corrugation 

(9) at the inner arc (8). 
A honeycomb body according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein each 
corrugation (9) at the outer arc (7) goes into a multiplicity of 

corrugations (9) at the inner arc (8).  
 
A honeycomb body according to one of the preceding claims 
wherein the sheets (4, 5) have interengaging microstructures (10, 11). 
A honeycomb body according to claim 5 wherein the 
microstructures (10, 11) at least in part comprise grooves (10) which 

are oriented at an angle, preferably approximately perpendicularly, 
with respect to the axis (1), into which grooves (10) engage other 

grooves (10) and/or knobs (11). 
A honeycomb body according to one of the preceding claims 
which has two end surfaces (12, 13) which are oriented approximately 

perpendicularly to the axis (1) and of which the first (12) is larger 
than the second (13), wherein the casing tube (2) extends to the first 

end surface (12) and has at least one holding structure (14, 15) which 
lies against the first end surface (12). 
A honeycomb body according to claim 7 wherein the holding 
structure (14, 15) is a lip (14) on the casing tube (2), the lip 

preferably completely extending around the casing tube (2). 
A honeycomb body according to claim 7 or claim 8 wherein the 
holding structure (14, 15) is a strap member (15) which is connected 

to the casing tube (2) fixedly in respect of the materials involved, 
in particular by welding, and which is preferably arranged centered on 

the first end surface (12). 
Use of a honeycomb body according to one of the preceding 
claims as a carrier for a catalyst for producing a catalytic reaction 

in a fluid flowing through the honeycomb body.
