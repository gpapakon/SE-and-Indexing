<ABSTRACT>
A soothing mattress for use as a portable crib and womb 
environment stimulator for an infant, comprising a crib 

simulator (10) formed of a non-allergic urethane foam material having 
a substantially U-shaped inner portion (12,14,16) into which a baby's 

head 
and torso can be fitted and protected from the external 

environment, the foam material crib simulator is coupled with 
a vibrator (28) for imparting to the crib simulator a vibratory 

motion simulating a general type of motion to which an unborn 
infant is subjected in at least the last trimester of a mother's 

pregnancy, and an activator (26) externally of the U-shaped inner

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a soothing mattress for simulating 
a resting environment of a mother's womb in which an infant or 
young child has the environment of closeness of the mother's 
womb as well as sounds and movements imparted to a foetus to 
simulate the environment of the last four months and preferably 
the third trimester of a mother's pregnancy. More particularly, the invention is concerned with 
providing, either together or individually, a sound simulating 
the sounds of a mother's womb as well as movement of a mother's 
womb which can be analogized to vibrations outside of a mother's 
womb as imparted to the foetus during at least the last 
trimester and possibly four months prior to birth of the child. The invention is also concerned with a soothing mattress 
which can also be used as a portable bed for use by an infant 
which is easily foldable and placed into a more compact 
condition, so that it will be easily transportable from place 
to place and yet have the necessary elements for use as a bed. The closest prior art known to the applicant is 
U.S.-A-5,063,912 issued on November 12, 1991 in the name of John 
Stewart Hughes, and this pertains to a baby sleep inducer 
calming method and device adapted for placement in a concealed 
or unobtrusive place in a baby crib or on a mattress, free of  
 
any connection to an energy source, having a housing for 
containing a self-contained source of energy and sound 
developer coupled thereto for producing a sound characteristic 
of a womb sound in the last four months of a foetus gestation 
period having a soothing, calming and sleep-inducing affect for 
a newborn infant when energized by the source of energy, which 
is free of external leads extending from the housing; the 
housing includes a protective casing to conceal and prevent 
unwanted access to the sound developer and the source of energy. There is other prior art which indicates that work has been 
done in this area. For example, Belkin, 
U.S.-A-3,292,611, is concerned with an infant mattress provided with 
heating and ticking mechanisms, primarily to distract or pacify 
an infant by using such distractions. The sounds emitted are 
intended to simulate a heartbeat and, at the same time, heat is 
generated. The device uses external leads and separate 
electrical energization which can be harmful to an infant, both 
from a point of view of accidental strangulation as well as a 
fire hazard from the explosive wires, albeit covered wires. U.S.-A-4,157,088 to Gracey is concerned with a

<CLAIMS>
A soothing mattress construction for use as a portable 
crib and womb environment simulator for an infant, comprising : 

a non-allergic urethane foam material having a base 
portion (12) and a substantially U-shaped portion (14, 16, 18) on 

top of the base portion forming a U-shaped section into which a 
baby's head and torso can be fitted and protected from an external 

environment while the baby reclines on the base portion and is free 
to move its head and body within the inner portion of the 

substantially U-shaped portion; the base portion forming a mattress 
portion and being enclosed within an outer covering (34) and acting 

as a protector for the infant to insulate the infant from a surface 
on which the base portion rests to prevent injury to the infant and 

the U-shaped portion (14, 16, 18) forming part of a bumper portion 
which partially surrounds the head of the infant resting on the 

mattress portion; a vibrator (28, 28a, 28b, 28c, 28d, 42, 42a) 
unitarily coupled with the foam material for imparting a vibratory 

motion simulating a general type of motion to which an unborn 
infant is subjected in at least the last trimester of a mother's 

pregnancy, the vibrator being insulated from the infant by the 
urethane foam material; the bumper portion including an exterior 

portion and at least one cavity (20a, 20b) accessible from the 
exterior portion, a self-contained sound imparter (24, 24a) housed 

in the at least one cavity for imparting vibrations and sound to an 
interior portion of the crib defined by the base portion (12) and 

the bumper portion and isolated therefrom, and the bumper portion  
 

cooperating with the base portion to permit folding to provide for 
the portability of the crib; a cover (30) for the cavity remote 

from an interior portion of the substantially U-shaped inner 

portion and accessible from the exterior portion, and means for 
locking the cover to an outer portion of the bumper portion; and 

activation means (26, 26a) externally of the U-shaped inner portion
