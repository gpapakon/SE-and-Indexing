<ABSTRACT>
Livestock and poultry are fed with feed containing 
at least one spice chosen from among the families 

Myristicaceae, Cruciferae, Rutaceae, Compositae, 
Pedaliaceae, Piperaceae, Leguminosae, Umbelliferae, 

Myrtaceae, Solanaceae, Labiatae, Lauraceae, Liliaceae and 
Zingiberaceae, whereby the active ingredients of the spice 

taken into the bodies of the thus-fed livestock and 
poultry are transferred to their internal fat thereby to 

modify their meat and to improve the smell of their fat. 
Accordingly, the fatty smell of the meat and fat to be 

obtained from the thus-fed livestock and poultry is 
removed and the freshness-keeping power of the meat and 

fat is enhanced. As the spices may be added to feed, 
livestock and poultry may efficiently take the spices 

with ease.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is to provide 
feed for livestock and poultry, from which meat and fat 
are desired to be obtained, and also to provide a method 
of feeding livestock and poultry with such feed so as to 
improve meat and fat to be obtained from them, in order 
that meat and fat to be obtainable from livestock and 
poultry are modified to have an improved power against 
oxidation, an improved power for retarding the elevation 
of their acid values and an improved power for keeping 
their freshness with the result that the freshness of the 
thus-modified meat and fat lasts long, that the quality, 
such as the smell and the taste, of the thus-modified meat 
is improved and that the quality of the thus-modified fat 
is improved. The amount of consumption of meats of livestock 
and poultry, such as pork and chicken, as fried meats,  
 
fried chickens, etc. is noticeably increasing in these 
days in the field of dining-out industry, etc. On the 
other hand, however, meats of livestock and poultry, 
especially their fats are easily oxidized and, in 
addition, their acid values are easily elevated to often 
detract from their taste. Further, it is difficult to 
keep their freshness, they often begin to smell, and their 
taste is often lowered. Therefore, some improvements in 
the method of storing them in refrigerators, etc. have 
heretofore been attempted but are not still satisfactory. 
At present, there is known no method for effectively 
enhancing the freshness-keeping power of meats of 
livestock and poultry themselves. Not only the above-mentioned 
meats of livestock and poultry but also their 
fats themselves are used variously, and the latter also 
have the same problems as those of the former. In consideration of the above-mentioned points, 
the present invention is to provide a means for enhancing 
the freshness-keeping power of meat and fat obtainable 
from livestock and poultry to thereby improve the quality 
of the meat and to modify the fat. In order to attain 
this object, according to the present invention, 
particular spices are fed to livestock and poultry from  
 
which their meat and fat are obtained. Spices as referred to herein mean those in a broad 
sense, including both substantially aromatic herbs which 
are produced essentially in the districts along the shore 
of the Mediterranean and aromatic and hot spices which 
are produced in the tropics and the sub-tropics. Known 
intrinsic functions of these spices essentially include an 
appetite-increasing effect due to
