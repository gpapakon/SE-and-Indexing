<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition 
for prevention or improvement of medical symptoms caused 
by leucotriene B4 (LTB₄), comprising as an effective 
ingredient an omega 9 series unsaturated fatty acid. More preferably the present invention relates a 
composition for prevention or improvement of 
inflammation, especially chronic inflammation such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, or allergy, comprising at least an 
effective ingredient selected from the group consisting 
of 6,9-octadecadienoic acid, 8,11-eicosadienoic acid and 
5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid. The inflammation is one of defence reactions of 
organisms caused by a physical or chemical stimulation, 
immunological phenomena involving antibodies, immune 
complex, degradation products of complements, or the 
like. During the inflammation, characteristic phenomena 
occur including expansion and perforation of 
microvessels, leak of blood components into spaces 
between tissues, migration of leucocytes to an 
inflammatory tissue, and the like, resulting in symptoms 
such as erythema, edema, hyperalgesia, ache etc. In a 
process of inflammation, various pharmacologically active 
substances are locally formed and liberated, and mediate 
inflammatory reactions.These substances are called 
chemical mediators of inflammation, and include 
plasmakinins such as bradykinin, serotonin, histamines 
and the like, prostaglandin (PG), leucotriene (LT), 
various leucocyte migration enhancement factors, and the 
like.  A condition wherein reaction harmful to an 
organism, such as destruction and abnormal reaction of 
tissue result from immune response is called as allergy. 
In the allergy process, it is known that an allergen 
invades into an organism and reacts with IgE antibody 
fixed to mast cell or basophilic leukocyte resulting in 
liberation of chemical transmitter such as histamines, 
leucotriene (LT), eosinophilic migration enhancement 
factor, neutrophilic migration enhancement factor, and 
the like, providing cell infiltration, destruction of 
tissues, contraction of smooth muscle, stimulation of 
vascular permeability, stimulation of mucous secretion 
etc. Generally, although anti-inflammatory drugs are 
drugs used for inhibiting inflammatory symptoms and 
alleviating destruction of tissues, in the broad sense, 
they include allergic reaction inhibitory drugs (anti-allergic 
drugs). Currently available anti-inflammatory 
drugs are classified to steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(adrenocortical hormones) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs.
