<CLAIMS>
Punch having a bottom part (10) which may be placed on 
a support surface, at least two punching units (20) 

which are lined up at an adjustable distance from one 
another on an elongated assembly element (34) of the 

bottom part (10) and each comprise a bottom die (46), 
an insertion slot (44) and a punching die (56), which 

is displaceable out of an upper end position counter 
to the action of a restoring spring (48) through the 

insertion slot (44) and the bottom die (46), and a 
pressure element (18) for displacing the punching dies 

(56), which is preferably in the form of a pressure 
lever, is pivotally supported or displaceably guided 

on the bottom part (10) and acts against the rear end 
faces (54) of the punching dies (56), the punching 

dies (56) in their upper end position striking under 
the action of their restoring spring (48) against an 

upper end stop (52) of the respective punching unit 
(20), 
characterized in
 that the pressure element (18) 
by means of at least one spring element (60, 62), 

which is disposed between bottom part (10) and 
pressure element (18) and spans the punching units, is 

liftable off the rear end faces (54) of the punching 
dies (56) situated in their upper end position so as 

to form a free space (64), and that in the lifted-off 
state of the pressure element (18) the assembly 

element (34) together with the punching units (20) 
lined up thereon 
is removable from the bottom part 
(10). 
Punch according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the 
spring element (60, 62) comprises a plunger (62), 

which lifts the pressure element (18) off the rear end 
faces (54) of the punching dies (56) situated in their 

upper end position, and a supporting spring (60) which  
 

holds the plunger (62) under initial stress against an 
upper end stop. 
Punch according to claim 2, 
characterized in
 that the 
spring forces of the supporting spring (60) and of the 

restoring springs (48) act in the same direction as 
one another. 
Punch according to one of claims 2 or 3, 
characterized 
in
 that the spring force of the supporting spring (60) 
is lower than the spring forces of the restoring 

springs (48). 
Punch according to one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterized 
in
 that the spring element comprises a plunger (62), 
which is vertically displaceable to a limited extent 

parallel to the punching dies (56) on the bottom part 
(10), is subject to the action of the supporting 

spring (60) preferably in the form of a helical 
compression spring and is applied by its upper end 

face against the pressure element (18, 66). 
Punch according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized 
in
 that the elongated assembly element takes the form 
of a sectional or multiple-cornered bar (34), on which 

the punching units (20) are clampable preferably by 
means of adjusting screws (36) at any desired distance 

from one another and which in turn is releasably 
lockable or latchable on the bottom part (10). 
Punch according to claim 6, 
characterized in
 that the 
sectional or multiple-cornered bar (34) is an 

injection-moulded part made of glass-fibre reinforced 
plastic material. 
Punch according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized 
by
 a clamping holder (38) which is preferably  
 

eccentrically disposed or formed on the bottom part 
(10), has a preferably upwardly open-edged through-opening 

(40) for receiving the elongated assembly 
element (34) and carries a clamping element (42) which 

engages into the opening (40). 
Punch according to claim 8, 
characterized by
 a holding 
device for the spring element (60, 62) which is 

preferably integrally connected to the clamping holder 
(38) and advantageously has a push guide for the 

plunger (62). 
Punch according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized 
in
 that the pressure element (18) is supported or 
guided on side pieces (12) which delimit the bottom 

part (10) and that disposed at the opposing inner 
surfaces of the side pieces, the distance between 

which corresponds to the length of the assembly 
element, are supporting or guide surfaces for the free 

ends of the elongated assembly element (34). 
Punch according to claim 10, 
characterized in
 that the 
supporting or guide surfaces are disposed in alignment 

with a vertical and a bottom horizontal boundary 
surface of the open-edged opening (40) of the clamping 

holder (38). 
Punch according to one of claims 1 to 11, 

characterized in
 that the spring element comprises at 
least one compression or torsion spring disposed 

between a side piece (12) of the bottom part (10) and 
the pressure element (18).
