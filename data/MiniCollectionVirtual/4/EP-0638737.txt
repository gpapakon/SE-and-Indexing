<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a retainer made of synthetic 
resin for a rolling-contact bearing which is used in a 

lubricating oil. The retainer comprises an aliphatic polyamide 
resin as a matrix and a hydrocarbon polymer which has itself 

no oil resistance and a good compatibility with the matrix, 
and which is dispersed in the matrix. Examples of the 

thermoplastic hydorcarbon polymer include olefin polymer and 
styrene polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a retainer
for a rolling-contact bearing
according to the preamble of claim 1.As a retainer for a rolling-contact bearing, there
have hitherto been used various materials comprising an
aliphatic polyamide resin (e.g. nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 46,
etc.) as a matrix, which are lightweight in comparison with
those made of metal and are superior in mechanical
properties.However, when an aliphatic polyamide resin is used
in a highly heated lubricating oil such as gear oil, its
poor durability (oil resistance) leads to deterioration
with time, which results in great reduction in strength.
This is because the lubricating oil is oxidized under
the condition of high temperature so that its acidity
is increased
and the aliphatic polyamide resin is thermally oxidized
under this heated, acid atmosphere.Accordingly, the upper limit of the temperature at
which a retainer made of an aliphatic polyamide resin matrix
for a rolling-contact bearing can be employed is about 120 to
130°C . At higher temperatures, a retainer made of
metal is normally used at present.It is also possible to use so-called super 
engineering plastics usable at higher temperatures, such
as polyether sulfone (PES), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS),
polyether ether ketone (PEEK), etc., instead of the
aliphatic polyamide resin. However, most of the super
engineering plastics are inferior in flexibility and
expensive in comparison with the aliphatic polyamide resin
so that their use is limited and they have not been put into
practical use yet. The document US-A-4 999 394 discloses a retainer for a roller
bearing comprising a polyamide resin, a percentage of an
elastomer and a percentage of a reinforcing fibre. According
to this document, polybutadiene is the hydrocarbon
resin used as elastomer.
The conventional retainer is intended to be less
susceptible to dimensional variations and to damage. No
specific measures are disclosed in that document how to obtain
excellent oil resistance when using such a retainer in a
lubricating oil at high temperatures. It is the object of the present invention to provide
a retainer according to the preamble of claim 1,
which can exhibit excellent oil resistance
when using it in a lubricating oil at high temperature.In order to accomplish the object, the present
inventors have studied how to improve oil resistance of the
retainer made of an aliphatic polyamide resin matrix for
a rolling-contact bearing, utilizing a polymer alloy
technique. Firstly, they studied to disperse materials
having a
