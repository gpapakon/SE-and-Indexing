<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for digitally printing a finely
detailed image using pulse width modulation (PWM) with

improved productivity over the prior art. Many images,
or portions of images, generated by printers utilizing

PWM do not require that any of the pixels be exposed
for the maximum time possible, but that a maximum

exposure can be determined for a selected portion of
the image, whether it is for a line, for a paragraph,

or for a selected color, that can then be used to speed
up the printing of that portion of the image. Thus, a

less than full density exposure can be set as the
maximum, and the scanning speed increased accordingly

to shorten the overall time required for printing that
portion of the image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
and a method for digitally printing a finely detailed
image, such as a full color photograph or slide
transparency, which has improved productivity over the
prior art.In my U.S. patent number 5,241,328, a digital
printing system is described which uses the heat energy
of a laser beam to print a finely detailed image onto a
receiver element, which, for example, is a slide
transparency. The apparatus and method described
therein provides improved linearity in tone scale
compared to previous images of that kind. The printed
image, which should be as faithful as possible to an
original or master image, is printed as a series of
dots or pixels by scanning the laser beam a line at a
time across a dye donor element held by vacuum against
a blank slide transparency or receiver element. The
laser beam is rapidly modulated in intensity by input
data corresponding to the master image and "spots" or
pixels of dye, corresponding to the pixels of the
master image, are transferred by thermal energy from
the dye donor element onto the slide transparency or
receiver. To obtain sufficiently high resolution, such
as needed in photographic prints or slide
transparencies, to give a desired degree of sharpness
in the image (e.g., at 100 power magnification for
slides), the dye pixels are very small, e.g., only
about 7 microns, and are written at a very close pitch,
for example, about 4,000 pixels per inch. They are 
written at a high speed (e.g., 140 KHZ) since otherwise
the printing of the entire image would take an
inordinately long time.As disclosed in the above-referenced
application, for a thermally printed reproduction of a
master image to be suitable for viewing at projection
magnifications of up to 100X, it is necessary that the
individual pixels of the printed image be very small
and very accurately positioned. It is also highly
desirable that the individual pixels each have a
density or tone value corresponding as closely as
possible to the respective densities of the pixels of
the master image. It is also necessary, as noted
above, that the speed of producing the image be
maximized to reduce the time necessary for the
production of each image.As also disclosed in the above-identified
application, the apparatus provided comprises a laser
and an electronic laser drive control and logic circuit
(LDCL) for thermally printing from one or more dye
donor elements onto a receiver element such as a slide
transparency or photographic print. The electronic
LDCL circuit is
