<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a bidirectional Schockley diode comprising a N-type layer (N1) sandwiched between two P-type layers (P1, P2). A first N-type region (N3) in the P-type layer (P1) extends over substantially half of the upper face. A second N-type region (N4) in the P-type layer (P2) extends substantially over a complementary half of the lower face. Each of the first and second regions projects with respect to the mid plane of the component by a length r such that r/e is less than 0.5, e being the thickness of the component.

<CLAIMS>
A protection component of the
bidirectional Shockley diode-type including a layer (N1)

of a first conductivity type sandwiched between two
layers (P1, P2) of the second conductivity type; a first

region (N3) of the first conductivity type formed from
the upper surface of the substrate in the layer (P1) of

the second conductivity type and extending over
substantially one half of said upper surface; and a

second region (N4) of the first conductivity type formed
from the lower surface of the substrate in the layer (P2)

of the second conductivity type and extending
substantially over one complementary half of the surface

of said lower surface,

   characterized in that each first and second
region protrudes with respect to the median plane of the

component by a length r such that ratio r/e is between
0.1 and 0.3, e being the thickness of the component,

whereby the current flowing through a component having a
predetermined surface area is increased.
The protection component of claim 1,
characterized in that ratio r/e is close to 0.2.
The protection component of claim 1,
characterized in that the first conductivity type is N-type.
The protection component of claim 1,
characterized in that the component is of the mesa-type.
The protection component of claim 1,
characterized in that the component is of the planar-type.
