<ABSTRACT>
A rubber plug (10) includes a seal portion (11) and an 
extension portion (15). Inner and outer peripheral lips (12,13) form 

respective water-tight seals between the rubber plug (10) and a 
cavity (2), and the rubber plug (10) and a wire (6). The extension 

portion (15) extends from the seal portion (11) toward an open end 
of the cavity (2). When a bending force acts on the wire (6), the 

extension portion (15) slightly deforms elastically, but the 
seal portion (11) will not be deformed. Therefore, the water-tight 

condition between the cavity (2) and the wire (6) is 
maintained. Therefore, even when a bending force acts on 

the wire (6), water is prevented from intruding into the 
cavity (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rubber plug that is used in
a waterproof connector for forming a water-tight seal between
a cavity in the connector housing and an electric
wire.An example of a conventional rubber plug is shown in
Fig. 4.A rubber plug 30 has a tubular shape as a whole. Annular
outer peripheral lips 32 are formed on an outer periphery
of the rubber plug, and annular inner peripheral lips
33 are formed on an inner periphery of the rubber plug. The
rubber plug 30 is fitted on an electric wire 40 fixedly
connected to a rear end portion of a metal terminal 45. The
rubber plug is inserted into an open end 43, together with
the metal terminal 45 and the wire 40, of a cavity 42 of a
connector housing 41.When the rubber plug is thus inserted, the outer peripheral
lips 32 are pressed against an inner peripheral
surface of the cavity 42, so that a water-tight seal is
formed between the rubber plug 30 and the inner surface of
the cavity 42. Also, the inner peripheral lips 33 are
pressed against an outer peripheral surface of the wire 40,
so that a water-tight seal is formed between the rubber
plug 30 and the wire 40. With this arrangement, water is
prevented from intruding into the cavity 42.Generally, depending on the manner of arranging the
wire 40, the wire 40 may be bent laterally at the open end
43 of the cavity 42, as shown in Fig. 5. In such a case, in
the above conventional rubber plug 30, a force bending the
wire 40 acts on the rubber plug 30, so that the rubber plug
30 is compressed at a region disposed inwardly of this bent
portion. Therefore, at the opposite side, that is, at a region
disposed outwardly of the bent portion, a gap 44 develops 
between the outer peripheral lips 32 of the rubber
plug 30 and the inner peripheral surface of the cavity 42.
This has the undesirable effect of allowing water to enter
into the cavity 42.In addition, the wire 40 comes in contact with the
sharp edge 50 of the connector, which may cause damage to
the wire.US-A-5,147,222, from which the present invention starts
from, discloses a sealed electrical connector including an
outer shell which is profiled to receive a pin housing
therein. The pin housing has mounted therein a plurality of
pins. The interior of the housing shell is sealed by placing
a plug over the end of a wire and placing a terminal at
the wire's end, the plug and wire into the rear of the connector
shell. To prevent the ingress of water into the
shell, the plug includes at its exterior end an elongate
collar or extension which, if the wire is

<CLAIMS>
A rubber plug in combination with a waterproof connector having a
housing (1) that includes a cavity (2) including an inner

surface,

said rubber plug (10; 20) comprising:
a seal portion (11; 21) that contacts the inner surface
of the cavity (2) and an exterior surface of a wire

(6) disposed within the rubber plug (10; 20); and
an extension portion (15; 25) extending from said seal
portion (11; 21) toward an open end (3) of said cavity (2),

wherein a gap (17) is formed between the outer periphery of said extension portion
(15; 25) and the inner surface of said cavity (2),

   characterized in that

said extension portion (15; 25) has a length that projects
outwardly from the open end (3) of said cavity (2).
The rubber plug of claim 1, wherein the seal portion
(11; 21) includes interior lips (12; 22) that form a

waterproof seal between the wire (6) and an inner portion
of the seal portion (11; 21), and exterior lips (13; 23)

that form a waterproof seal between the inner surface of
the cavity (2) and an outer portion of the seal portion

(11; 21).
The rubber plug of claim 1 or 2, wherein the extension
portion (25) includes at least one interior lip (22)

that forms a waterproof seal between the wire (6) and the
interior portion of the extension portion (25).
The rubber plug of claim 2 or 3, wherein at least
one of the extension portion interior lips (22) and the

seal portion interior lips (12; 22) maintain contact with
the wire (6) despite application of a bending force to the

wire (6). 
The rubber plug of anyone of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the extension portion (15; 25) prevents the wire (6) from

contacting an edge located near the open end (3) of the
cavity (2).
The rubber plug of anyone of claims 1 to 5, wherein
an inner dimension of the extension portion (15; 25) is

larger than an outer dimension of the wire (6) to define a
space (18) between the extension portion (15; 25) and the

wire (6).
The rubber plug of anyone of claims 2 to 6, wherein
a bending force applied to the wire (6) will cause the extension

portion (15; 25) to contact the inner surface of
the cavity (2) thereby enabling said exterior lips (13; 23)

of the seal portion (11; 21) to maintain contact with the
entire periphery of the inner surface of the cavity (2) to

maintain a waterproof seal.
