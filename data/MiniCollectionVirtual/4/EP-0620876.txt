<ABSTRACT>
In most paper machines today, the cross-section is adjusted by deforming the outlet slot of the head box nozzle. This leads to the known asymmetry defects of the paper. More recently, it is known to adjust the cross-section by post-diluting the individual partial streams supplied to the head box. The invention is characterised in that the thick stock is no longer diluted in its totality for a head box, but is rather distributed according to the cross-section requirements from the machine. The head box stock density is diluted with the sieve water in the partial streams. The sieve water systems of several head boxes may thus be assembled and supplied with stock of the same or different qualities by the disclosed device. This has the advantage of allowing the cross-section to be adjusted without deforming the head box nozzle and of allowing considerable simplications of the sieve water systems for forming multi-ply or multilayer sheets with stock of the same or different qualities.

Method of adjusting the cross-sectional profile of the weight 
per unit area of fibrous material webs in papermaking machines, 

in which a mixture of two liquids forming the fibrous material 
suspension is fed to the head-box nozzle, of which one liquid 

contains the fibrous material and the other is free of fibrous 
material, and of which the liquid used in the larger quantity is 

supplied first through a distributor (1, 19) acting as pulsation 
damper and is then supplied in the form of discrete liquid flows 

by sections to the head-box nozzle of the papermaking machine 
through connecting lines (13) branching from the distributor (1, 

19), whereas the liquid used in a smaller quantity is introduced 
at some distance, having regard to the flow path to be 

travelled, from the head-box nozzle and individually adjustable 
with regard to quantity into the aforementioned liquid flows, 

characterized in that the white water from the papermaking 
machine is fed to the distributor (1, 19) acting as pulsation 

damper, and that thick stock is introduced individually 
adjustably in quantity into the liquid flows, formed from white 

water, departing from the distributor. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the liquid 
flows consisting of white water and thick stock are brought into 

turbulence along the path to the head-box nozzle for the purpose 
of mixing. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that dyes and/or 
chemicals are fed into the thick stock before its introduction 

into the liquid flows formed from white water. 
Application of the method according to claim 1 to the production 
of fibrous material webs consisting of several layers of 

different fibrous material qualities, in that the liquid flows 
departing from the distributor (1, 19) are subdivided into a 

number of groups of liquid flows corresponding to the number of  
 

layers to be formed, and that a predetermined thick stock 
quality is fed to each of the groups of liquid flows. 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to one or more 
of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the inlet of a 

distributor (1, 19), itself of known type, acting as pulsation 
damper and connected via connecting lines for the fibrous 

material suspension by sections to the head-box nozzle, is 
connected to a pump for the white water from the papermaking 

machine and that a metering device for thick stock is associated 
with the distributor (1, 19), the inlet to which metering device 

is connected to the pump for the thick stock of the papermaking 
machine and which (metering device) is connected, by a number of 

metering lines (13) containing regulating valves (15) 
corresponding to the number of connecting lines departing from 

the distributor, to each of the connecting lines leading to the 
head-box. 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
metering lines (13), as they run inside the distributor (1), 

each lead into the inlet region of the relevant distributor 
attachment (8) or of the relevant connecting line.
