<ABSTRACT>
A developing apparatus for developing a 
latent image formed on an image bearing member 

includes a first frame having a developer container 
for containing a developer; a second frame having a 

developer carrying member for carrying the developer 
supplied from the developer container to supply the 

developer to the latent image; a sealing member (17a,17b) for 
sealing an opening for supplying the developer from 

the developer container to the developer carrying 
member; wherein the sealing member (17a,17b) is pulled between 

the first frame and the second frame along a pulling 
path in a pulling direction, whereby the opening is 

opened; an end seal (21) downstream of said opening and a projection 
(23) disposed in contact with said end seal (21) upstream of said end 

seal (21) with respect to said pulling direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus and a detachable process cartridge therefor.The image forming apparatus may be in the form of
an electrophotographic copying machine or a printer,
using a developer.Electrophotographic image forming apparatus are
widely used as copying machines or the like. In such an
apparatus, a photosensitive drum 1 is uniformly charged
and is selectively exposed to form a latent image. The
latent image is visualized with a developer, and the
visualized image is transferred onto a recording
material. In such an apparatus, a photosensitive drum
and a developing device having a developer container or
the like are unified into a cartridge. The cartridge is
mounted to a main assembly of the apparatus. The latent
image formed on the photosensitive drum is developed
using a developer accommodated in the developer container
in the cartridge.As described in patent document EP-A-0330225, in
order to prevent leakage of the developer from the
container during transportation, the opening of the
developer container is sealed by a sealing member. Prior
to the start of the use, the operator removes the sealing
member to open the developer container, by which the
developer contained in the container is supplied to the
developing roller or the like through the opening. 
However, when the operator opens the container, if the
operator pulls the sealing member obliquely through an
error, the opening action is not performed as desired
with the result that a desired opening region is not
provided.The present invention is concerned with improving
the operativity in removing the sealing member whilst
effectively preventing developer from leaking out.In accordance with one aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a process cartridge
detachably mountable to a main assembly of an
electrophotographic image forming apparatus, the
cartridge comprising: an electrophotographic
photosensitive member which can bear a latent image; a
first frame having a developer container for containing
a developer; a second frame having a developer carrying
member for carrying the developer supplied from the
developer container to develop the latent image; and a
sealing member for sealing an opening for supplying the
developer from the developer container to the developer
carrying member, wherein the sealing member can be pulled
between the first and second frame in a pulling direction
to open the opening; characterised by: an end seal
disposed downstream of said opening with respect to the
pullin
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process cartridge detachably mountable to a main
assembly of an electrophotographic image forming

apparatus, the cartridge comprising:

an electrophotographic photosensitive member (7)
which can bear a latent image;
a first frame having a developer container (12a) for
containing a developer;
a second frame (12b) having a developer carrying
member (10) for carrying the developer supplied from the

developer container to develop the latent image; and
a sealing member (17b) for sealing an opening for
supplying the developer from the developer container to

the developer carrying member, wherein the sealing member
can be pulled between the first and second frame (5) in

a pulling direction to open the opening;

   characterised by:

an end seal (21) disposed downstream of said opening
with respect to the pulling direction;
a pair of confining projections (22a, 22b) provided between
the first and second frames at respective lateral sides

of the sealing member with respect to the pulling
direction and extending through holes formed in the end

seal, for confining the pulling direction of the sealing
member; and
a guard projection (23) engaging an upstream side
of the end seal with respect to the pulling direction to 

reduce the tendency for the end seal to be dislodged upon
pulling of the seal member.
A cartridge according to claim 1, wherein the confining
projections are provided on the second frame and project

from the second frame to the first frame.
A cartridge according to claim 2, wherein the first
frame is provided with openings which receive the confining

projections.
A cartridge according to any preceding claim,
wherein the confining projections are in the form of bosses.
A cartridge according to any preceding claim,
wherein a separate hard plate having a developer supply opening is disposed between the

first and second frames and the sealing member is mounted
on the hard plate.
A cartridge according to any preceding claim,
wherein the confining projections are 1 mm - 3 mm away from the

pulling path.
A cartridge according to any preceding claim,
wherein said sealing member comprises a sealing film and

a flexible tape having a first portion extending along
a surface of said sealing film and a second portion at 

the other surface of the sealing film, wherein the
sealing film can be torn along the first portion of the

flexible tape by pulling the second portion of the
flexible tape to thereby open the opening.
A cartridge according to any preceding claim,
wherein said first and second frames are joined by

ultrasonic wave fusing.
A cartridge according to any preceding claim,
wherein the guard projection and the end seal are

provided on the second frame.
An image forming apparatus having a cartridge
according to any preceding claim detachably mounted

thereto.
