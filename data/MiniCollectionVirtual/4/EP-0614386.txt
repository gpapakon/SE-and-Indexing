<ABSTRACT>
In a pen-shaped syringe comprising a proximal part containing a dose setting and driving mechanism from which a piston rod (3) is advanced to actuate a piston of a reservoir (16) in a distal part, the proximal and distal parts are coupled together by a bayonet coupling, the bayonet coupling means (21, 26, 27) of the distal part having means for rotating a piston rod guide (8) mounted on the bayonet coupling means (6, 7, 9, 11) of the proximal part, the piston guide means (8) defining the rotational position of the piston rod (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to pen shaped syringes comprising a proximal 
part containing a dose setting and driving mechanism, a piston rod having a non-circular 
cross section and carrying along one side a cogging engaged by a carrier 
unidirectonally transmitting axial movements from the driving mechanism to the 
piston rod, a piston rod guide positioned to maintain the piston rod in a rotational 
position in the syringe ensuring the engagement between the carrier of the drive 
mechanism and the cogging of the piston rod, the piston rod guide having a non-circular 
opening conforming to the cross section of the piston rod, and through 
which opening the piston rod passes, and a distal part containing a tubular reservoir 
for medicine, which reservoir at its distal end is closed by a pierceable rubber 
membrane, and at its proximal end is closed by a piston actuated by the piston rod 
of the proximal part. Such a syringe is described in EP 0 037 696. This syringe has a lever 
which may be manually operated to disengage the driving mechanism and the 
cogged piston rod to enable retraction of the piston rod. Alternatively the 
engagement may be released automatically when a first drive member of the driving 
mechanism is in a fully retracted position. Such syringes are used by patients which have to frequently inject 
themselves. The reservoir contains medicine sufficient for several injections, and 
when the reservoir is empty, the proximal and the distal part of the syringe may be 
unscrewed and the reservoir renewed, whereafter the parts are screwed together 
again. However, this screwing movement may be difficult to perform especially 
to patients suffering from diseases reducing their tactile motor function, and this way 
it may be difficult for these patients to administer the medicine which could just 
mitigate these symptoms. Therefore, it is the object of the invention to provide a pen syringe 
wherein the medicine reservoir could easily be changed without performing many 
turns of screwing. This is obtained by a syringe of the above mentioned kind, which  
 
syringe according to the invention is characterized in, that the proximal and the distal 
part have interlocking bayonet coupling means, and that the bayonet coupling 
means on the distal part is provided with means engaging the piston guide to rotate 
this guide and consequently the piston rod during at least part of the rotational 
movement of the bayonet coupling means in relation to each other to disengage the 
carrier means and the piston

A pen shaped syringe comprising a proximal part containing a dose 
setting and driving mechanism, a piston rod (3) having a non-circular cross section 

and carrying along one side a cogging (2) engaged by a carrier (1) unidirectonally 
transmitting axial movements from the driving mechanism to the piston rod (3), a 

piston rod guide (8) positioned to maintain the piston rod (3) in a rotational position 
in the syringe ensuring the engagement between the carrier (1) of the drive 

mechanism and the cogging (2) of the piston rod (3) when the syringe is in use, the 
piston rod guide (8) having a non-circular opening conforming to the cross section 

of the piston rod (3), and through which opening the piston rod passes, and a distal 
part containing a tubular reservoir (16) for medicine, which reservoir at its distal end 

is closed by a pierceable rubber membrane, and at its proximal end is closed by a 
piston (20) actuated by the piston rod (3) of the proximal part,

the proximal and the distal part have interlocking bayonet coupling means (6,7,9,11 

and 21,26,27), and that the bayonet coupling means (21,26,27) on the distal part is 
provided with means (22) engaging the piston rod guide (8) to rotate this guide and 

consequently the piston rod (3) during at least part of a rotational movement of the 
bayonet coupling means in relation to each other to disengage the carrier means 

and the piston rod cogging and allow the piston to be pushed back when the distal 
part is dismounted and to establish engagement when the distal part is mounted.

outer diameter corresponding to the inner diameter of the tubular distal part and 

leaving a space between the flange (7) and the end surface (5), the flange being cut 
away preferably at diametrically opposite positions, and locking protrusion (21,26,27) 

on the inner surface at the proximal end of the distal part, which protrusions 
correspond to the cuts of the flange and extend axially from the proximal end of the 

distal part to a position a distance away from this proximal end, which distance  
 

corresponds to the distance between the flange (7) and the end surface (5). 
A pen syringe according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in, that the piston 
guide is mounted at the distal end of the stud (6) rotatably journaled in this stud and

(8) being provided with engaging stop means (14,31) limiting the rotational 
movement of the piston guide, and that the inner surface of the distal part is 

provided with a protrusion (22) engaging a cut (28) in the piston guide disc (8), 
which protrusion lies at a distance from the proximal end of the distal part 

corresponding to the length of the stud (6). 
A pen syringe according to claim 2 or 3 
characterized
 in, that the 
flange (7) is provided with a set of cuts, a first cut forming a slot (10) through the 

flange (7) and pair of cuts at a position principally diametrically opposite the first cut 
but provided on both sides of a piece (11) of the flange (7) left at the position 

exactly diametrically opposite the first cut.

disposable part containing the reservoir (16) and a pawl mechanism (24) for 

engagement with the cogging (2) of the piston rod (3), and the cut (28) in the piston 
guide disc (8) engaged by a protrusion (22) on the inner side of the distal part of the
