<ABSTRACT>
A speech parameter encoder capable of encoding 
spectrum parameters at a bit rate of 1 kb/s or less 

with comparatively small amount of operations and 
memory capacity. A spectrum parameter calculation 

unit (130) derives a spectrum parameter representing 
the spectrum envelope of a discrete input speech 

signal through division thereof into frames each 
having a predetermined time length. A weighted 

coefficient calculation unit (150) derives a weighted 
coefficient corresponding to an auditory masking 

threshold value through derivation thereof from the 
speech signal. A spectrum parameter quantization 

unit (160) receives the weighted coefficient and the 
spectrum parameter and centeses the spectrum 

parameter through search of a codebook such as to 
minimize the weighting distortion based on the 

weighted coefficient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to speech
parameter encoders for high quality encoding speech
signal spectrum parameter at low bit rates.As speech parameter encoding, i.e., encoding of
speech signal spectrum parameter at as low bit rate
as 2 kb/s, there has been known VQ-SQ: vector-scalar
quantization method using LSP (Line Spectrum Pair)
coefficients as spectrum parameters. As for a
specific method, it is possible to refer to, for
instance, T. Moriya et al "Transform Coding of
Speech using a Weighted Vector Quantizer", IEEE J.
Sel. Areas, Commun., pp. 425-431, 1988 (Literature
1). In this method, LSP coefficient obtained as
spectrum parameter for each frame is once quantized
and decoded with a previously formed vector
quantization codebook, and then an error signal
between the original LSP and the quantized decoded
LSP is scalar-quantized. As the vector quantization
codebook, a codebook is preliminarily formed by
training with respect to a large quantity of
spectrum parameter data bases such that it comprises
2B (B being the number of bits for spectrum parameter
quantization) different codevectors. As for the
training method of codebook, it is possible to refer
to, for instance, Linde et al "An Algorithm for
Vector Quantization Design", IEEE Trans. COM-28, pp. 
84-95, 1980 (Literature 2).Further, as a more efficient well-known
encoding method, there is a split vector
quantization method, in which the dimensions (for
instance 10 dimensions) of the LSP parameter is
divided into a plurality of divisions (each of 5
dimensions, for instance), and a vector quantization
codebook is searched for the quantization for each
division. For the details of this method, it is
possible to refer to, for instance, K. K. Paliwal et
al "Efficient Vector Quantization of LPC Parameters
at 24 Bits/Frame", IEEE Trans. Speech and Audio
Processing, pp. 3-14, 1993 (Literature 3).In order to reduce the bit rate of the spectrum
parameter encoding to be 1 kb/s or less, it is
required to reduce the spectrum parameter
quantization bit number to 20 bits per frame (with a
frame length of 20 ms) or less while holding the
distortion due to the spectrum parameter
quantization to be within the perceptual limit of
auditory sense. In the prior art methods, it has
been difficult to do so because of the lack of
reflection of auditory sense characteristics by the
distortion measure, thus leading to great speech
quality deterioration with reduction of the
quantization bit number to 20 or less.It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a
