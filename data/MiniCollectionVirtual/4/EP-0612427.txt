<ABSTRACT>
A holder for strip-like information carriers intended for use in shops, stores and like establishments in conjunction with goods and articles that are displayed on pronged racks. The holder includes a mounting part (1) which is intended to be fitted to the prong or prongs of a pronged rack and an information-carrier receiving part (5) which is connected to the mounting part (1). The mounting part (1) is intended to be secured to the inwardly located part of at least one prong and has a cantilever arm (4) which extends above and generally parallel with the prong. The information-carrier receiving part (5) is fitted to the forward end of the arm (4) in a manner which allows the part (5) to be swung up when removing an article from the prong.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a holder for strip-like 
information carriers intended for use in self-service 
stores, shops and like establishments for use 
in conjunction with goods displaced on a pronged rack 
and comprising a holder part which is intended to be 
fitted to the rack and an information-carrier receiving 
part which is connected to the first mentioned holder 
part. Effective and efficient holders are known which can be 
fitted to the front edge surfaces of shelving, wire 
cages or baskets and the like in shops and stores, and 
which carry information strips relating to the goods 
displayed. On the other hand, it has been more difficult to produce 
inexpensive and effective holder means for information 
carriers which disclose information concerning 
goods and articles that are displayed for sale on 
pronged racks, for instance packaged articles displayed 
on long, substantially horizontal prongs. In order to enable customers to read the information 
disclosed, the information should be presented on 
labels of normal size placed on the forward ends of the 
prongs as, for example, is shown in US-A-4 540 093 . It is also beneficial to store personnel when 
one and the same label size can be used in all instances. 
One problem, however, resides in the provision of 
a holder for labels of this kind which will not obstruct 
removal of packaged articles or other goods from 
the prongs. This is particularly difficult to achieve 
when the labels are placed forwardly of the ends of the 
prongs. Labels which are fitted above the prongs encroach 
on expensive display space. Furthermore, it is  
 
desirable to eliminate the need to use separate, empty 
prongs solely as label or tag carriers. 
The main object of the present invention is to provide 
a holder for strip-like information carriers which is 
intended for use with pronged racks and which eliminates 
the aforesaid drawbacks, among other things. This object is achieved in accordance with the present 
invention in that the holder part, which is intended to 
receive an information carrier is mounted forwardly of 
the front ends of the prong and can be swung-up when 
removing articles from the prong or prongs of the rack 
structure. According to the present invention, a holder is provided 
which is defined in the independent claim 1. A holder of this kind has the advantage of enabling 
standard-sized labels to be used and placed in a position 
in which the information thereon can be read 
easily by the customer. Another advantage is that no

<CLAIMS>
A holder for strip-like information carriers intended 
for use in shops, stores and like establishments 

in conjunction with goods and articles that are displayed 
on pronged racks, said holder comprising a 

mounting part (1) which is intended to be fitted to elongated 
prongs and a part (5) which is 

connected to the mounting part (1) and which is intended 
to accommodate said information carrier, wherein 

the mounting part (1) is intended 
to be secured to the inner part of at least 

one prong and is provided with a cantilever arm (4) which 
extends above and essentially parallel with said prong; 

in that the information-carrier receiving part of the 
holder has the form of a pocket (5) which is open along 

the upper edge thereof; in that the pocket is so mounted 
on the forward end of the cantilever arm (4) as to 

enable the pocket to swing upwardly as an article is 
removed from the prong; and in that the forward end of 

the arm (4) has at least one supporting part (11) which 
bears against the rear wall of the pocket (5) so that 

when said pocket is in a downwardly swung position, the 
pocket can be opened by pressing against the lower part 

of the front wall of the pocket. 
A holder according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the upward swinging movement of 

the information-carrier receiving pocket (5) is limited, 
so that it is always able to return to its normal, 

downwardly swung position under the influence of gravity. 
A holder according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the pocket (5) is transparent; 

in that at least one part (8) of the upper part of the  
 

rear pocket wall is folded rearwardly to form a downwardly 
open, cylindrical channel; and in that the 

forward end of the cantilever arm (4) has a transversely 
extending pivot-pin (10) which coacts with the 

channel. 
A holder according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the cross-dimension of the channel 

opening is somewhat smaller than the cross-dimension 
of the pivot-pin (10); and in that the pin can be 

pressed into the channel while flexing the channel wall 
slightly outwards, so that the pivot pin will be held 

securely in the channel as the wall returns to its 
original position. 
A holder according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized
 
in that the channel wall (8) is provided 

with a slot (9) which receives the cantilever arm (4) 
when the information-carrier receiving pocket (5) is 

swung up; and in that the depth of the slot (9) is 
adapted to limit upward swinging of the pocket (5) such 

as to allow said pocket to return to a downwardly-depending 

position under the influence of gravity. 
A holder according to Claim 5, 
characterized
 
in the depth of the slot (9) is chosen 

so that the pocket (5) can be swung up through an angle 
of about 90Â°. 
A holder according to any one of Claims 1-6, 

characterized
 in that the pocket (5) is an 
integral part of an extruded profiled section of flexible 

plastic material. 
A holder according to any one of Claims 1-7, 

characterized
 in that the mounting part  
 

(1), the cantilever arm (4) and the pivot-pin (10) 
fixedly joined to the arm (4) form a one-piece structure 

produced preferably by pressure-moulding a rigid 
plastic material.
