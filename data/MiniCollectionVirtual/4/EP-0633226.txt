<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preventing or
inhibiting the precipitation of calcium carbonate in
aqueous systems and more particularly to a method for
preventing the precipitation of calcium carbonate in
aqueous systems which contain a relatively high
concentration of magnesium ions.Calcium carbonate precipitation is a common problem
in industrial aqueous systems due to the low solubility
of calcium carbonate in water, particularly in water
having an elevated pH. Polyphosphates and organophosphonates
have been used for stabilizing calcium carbonate
in aqueous systems. However, these compounds contain
phosphorus which is environmentally unacceptable since
sufficiently high levels of phosphorus in the effluent
stream may serve as a nutrient to aquatic life. Under
high system water temperatures or long holding times,
polyphosphates tend to hydrolyze to orthophosphate. The
limited solubility of calcium orthophosphate, which is
likely to form, makes it difficult to maintain adequate
concentrations of phosphates in many instances. This
reversion process can also create sludge formation
problems in the aqueous system. For these reasons, the
use of the polyphosphates and organophosphonates
heretofore for inhibiting the precipitation of calcium
carbonate have not been completely satisfactory. It is an object of this invention to provide a
method for inhibiting or preventing the precipitation of
calcium carbonate in aqueous systems.It is another object of this invention to provide a
method for inhibiting or preventing the precipitation of
calcium carbonate in aqueous systems having a relatively
high concentration of magnesium ions.It is yet another object of this invention to
provide a method for inhibiting or preventing the
precipitation of calcium carbonate in aqueous systems
using an agent which is considered calcium insensitve.In accordance with the present invention there has
been provided a method for inhibiting or preventing the
precipitation of calcium carbonate in aqueous systems
which contain magnesium ions which comprises adding to
the system, in an amount effective to inhibit or prevent
the precipitation of calcium carbonate, a copolymer of
(meth)acrylic acid and t-butyl acrylamide.The present invention is directed to a novel method
of inhibiting or preventing the precipitation of calcium
carbonate in aqueous systems which contain a relatively
high concentration of magnesium ions. For purposes of
this invention, the terminology "relatively high
concentration of magnesium ions" means a
