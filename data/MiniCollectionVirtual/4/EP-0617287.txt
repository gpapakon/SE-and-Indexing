<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a biospecific assay method, in 
which microparticles coated with the bioaffinity reactant A 

binding the analyte to be assayed; the sample to be 
analyzed, and the labelled bioaffinity reactant B are 

mixed. After the binding reaction the signal strength from 
the labelled bioaffinity reactant B bound to the 

microparticles is quantitated for the determination of the 
concentration of the analyte in the sample. Accord
ing to 
the invention, such an amount of sample and microparticles 

is used in the assay that after binding of the analyte of 
the sample to the said amount of microparticles, each 

individual microparticle will emit such a signal strength 
as to allow the measurement of the analyte concentration 

over the whole range of typical analyte concentrations, and 
the signal strength from each microparticle is measured 

separately.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a biospecific assay method in 
which the analyte to be assayed is bound to the surface of 
microparticles through a bioaffinity reactant binding the 
aforesaid analyte, and the amount of analyte bound to 
individual microparticles is determined. The publications and other materials used herein to 
illuminate the background of the invention, and in 
particular, cases to provide additional details respecting 
the practice, are incorporated by reference. Traditionally, radioimmunoassays were in the beginning 
performed in solution using test-tubes and complicated 
separation methods. With the advent of solid phase 
technology radioactive isotopes have been replaced by 
diverse labels, and especially monoclonal antibodies have 
been used in an increasing number of applications. The aforementioned improvements have made a wider range of 
traditional immunoassays and other bioaffinity assay 
methods available (e.g. Alternative Immunoassays, W.P. 
Collins, Wiley, Chichester 1985, and Luminescence 
Immunoassay and Molecular Applications, Ed. Knox van Dyke, 
CRC Press, Boston 1990, and R.P. Ekins et al., Clin. Chem. 
1991; 37:1955 - 1967). Solid phase assays have become 
routine assay methods both in the field of competitive and 
non-competitive assays, and the traditional test-tube has 
often been replaced by alternative solid phase facility. 
The microtiter plate was introduced as a solid phase for 
routine hormone assays in 1984 when Wallac Oy (Turku, 
Finland) introduced their DELFIA technology. Other 
commercial enterprises have also adopted the microtiter 
plate in similar routine assays, which, however, are based  
 
on different labelling technologies. Microparticles manufactured of different materials have for 
some time been available as an alternative solid phase for 
bioaffinity assays (e.g. Molday W.J. et al., J. Cell. 
Biol.: 1975: 64, 75, and Nustad K. et al.: Microspheres. 
Medical and biological applications, Ed. A. Rembaum and 
Z.A. TÃ¶kes, Boca Raton, Florida, CRC Press 1988). Compared 
to microtiter plates the microparticles offer several 
advantages, for instance an immobilization method for 
bioaffinity reactants more easily adaptable to production 
scale, and a greater reaction velocity obtainable when 
using microparticles. The capacity of the microsphere-associated 
solid phase is also easily controllable by 
simply dispensing an amount of particles optimal for the 
method in question. The greatest disadvantages of 
microparticles have been traditionally
