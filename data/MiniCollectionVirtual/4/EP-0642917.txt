<CLAIMS>
Double belt press for the continuous manufacture
of material webs (23), during the manufacture of which

the material passes through a free-flowing state, with a
rigid press frame, with, mounted rotatably in the press

frame, deflection drums (2, 2', 5, 5') with an upper and
a lower endless pressing belt (1, 1') which is guided via

the deflection drums, the pressing zone, in which the
material web is guided and pressed under a surface

pressure, being formed between the mutually opposite
outer sides of the pressing belts (1, 1'), and with

pressure chambers (14, 14', 15, 15') which are delimited
in the vertical direction by pressure plates (7, 7', 10,

10') fastened in the press frame and by the inner sides
of the pressing belts (1, 1') and in the horizontal

direction by an inner (9, 9', 12, 12') and possibly an
outer (8, 8', 11, 11') sliding-surface seal which are in

each case annularly self-contained and between which an
annular space (13, 13') is formed, and which chambers can

be acted upon with fluid pressure media for generating
the surface pressure on the pressing belts, characterized

in that, in those pressure chambers which are operated
with a lower pressure than those in each case following

in the running direction of the pressing belts, and
possibly in the part of the annular space (13, 13')

facing the press entrance in front of the first pressure
chamber in the running direction of the pressing belts,

belt support strips (16, 16', 17, 17') are arranged,
which are supported against the pressure plate and which,

with their surface (18') facing the belt, projecting side
delimitations (19') of this surface and the belt, form

additional support pressure chambers (20') which are
acted upon with a constant mass flow of the same fluid

pressure medium as the pressure chamber in or in front of
which they are arranged.
Double belt press according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the support strips are designed at the

same time as heat-transmission strips. 
Double belt press according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the support strips contain electric

heating bars in bores.
Double belt press according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the support strips contain ducts, through

which a heat-transfer medium flows.
