<ABSTRACT>
An electric lamp according to the invention is provided with a lamp vessel 
(20) which is sealed in a gastight manner and has a wall (21) of ceramic material, while 

at least one current supply conductor (31a,b) is connected to an electric element (30a,b) 
arranged in the lamp vessel (20) and issues to the exterior 
via
 a lead-through 
channel 

(23a,b) in the wall (21). The current supply conductor (31a,b) has a first part (32a,b) 
with a comparatively high and a second part (33a,b) with a comparatively low melting 

point, which parts form a welded joint (36a,b) with mutually facing ends (34a,b; 
35a,b). The first part (32a,b) merges into a narrowing end (34a,b) having a length L 

and having a circumference O at the transition, which length L is at least one tenth of 
the circumference O, while the end (34a,b) is embedded at least partly in the end 

(35a,b) of the second part (33a,b). The electric lamp according to the invention has the 
advantage that the current supply conductors to be used therein can be manufactured 

more efficiently and with less wastage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electric lamp provided with a lamp vessel 
which is sealed in a gastight manner and has a wall of ceramic material, at least one 
current supply conductor being connected to an electric element arranged in the lamp 
vessel, which current supply conductor issues from the lamp vessel to the exterior via a 
lead-through channel in the wall and comprises a first part with a comparatively high 
and a second part with a comparatively low melting point, which parts form a welded 
joint with mutually facing ends. Such an electric lamp, a high-pressure discharge lamp, is known from 
US 3,363,133. A wall of ceramic material is understood to mean in the present 
description and claims a wall made from a refractory material such as monocrystalline 
metal oxide, for example sapphire, polycrystalline metal oxide, for example translucent 
gastight aluminium oxide (DGA), yttrium-aluminium garnet (YAG) or yttrium oxide 
(YOX), or polycrystalline non-oxidic material such as aluminium nitride (AlN). In the 
known lamp, the wall of the lamp vessel is made of DGA. The lamp vessel constitutes a 
discharge vessel which encloses a discharge space provided with a filling comprising 
metal halides. The discharge vessel comprises a tubular part and disc-shaped end parts 
which close off the tubular part on either side. A current supply conductor issues from 
the discharge vessel to the exterior at either end through a lead-through channel in each 
of the end parts. The current supply conductors have a first part made of tungsten, with 
a melting point of 3680 K, to which a second part made of niobium, with a melting 
point of 2770 K, is welded. End portions of the first parts extending into the discharge 
space serve as a pair of electrodes and thus constitute the electric element. A practical method of achieving a welded joint between the parts is by 
means of resistance welding (butt welding). The parts are each connected to a pole of a 
current source then and pressed against one another with their ends. The heat generation 
in the contact surface between the two parts causes the part with the lower melting point  
 
to melt, whereby a welded joint with the other part is created. The lamp vessel of a lamp with a ceramic lamp vessel is formed by means 
of (pre)sintering previous to the provision and gastight fastening of the current supply 
conductors. In general, the current supply conductor is passed through the lead-through 
channel with narrow fit, after which a melting-ceramic connection is
