<ABSTRACT>
Finely divided crystalline sodium aluminium silicates with the composition 0.9 to 1.1 Na2O : 1 Al2O3 : 1.8 to 3.6 SiO2 are obtained by the continuous crystallization of an aqueous suspension of X-ray amorphous sodium aluminium silicate at high temperature. The X-ray amorphous sodium aluminium silicates are produced by mixing an aqueous sodium aluminate solution with an aqueous sodium silicate solution in the presence of an excess of sode lye at high temperature. The precipitate is taken on mixing the reaction components or later, but before crystallization, through an agitator ball mill suitable for wet crushing, the apparent volume of the balls in which is greater than 50 % of the mill chamber volume, and the average time spent in the mill was kept at 3 to 40 s at a temperature of 40 to 80  DEG C. The quality requirements for the use of the product as a builder in washing, rinsing and cleaning agents can be reliably and reproducibly met.
