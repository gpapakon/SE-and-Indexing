<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to compositions for
treatment of diarrhea caused by bacterial infection.Diarrhea caused by strains of pathogenic
E. coli has been found to be associated with the
production of a variety of enterotoxins. Some pathogenic
E. coli enterohemorrhagic produce enterotoxins that are
closely related to the shiga toxin associated with
Shigella-caused dysentery. The first member of the
family of shiga-like toxins (SLT) to be isolated was
cytotoxic for African Green Monkey (Vero) cells and was
originally called verotoxin. Since its structural
similarity to shiga toxin has been established by
sequencing of the relevant genes, this toxin is now more
commonly called shiga-like toxin I (SLTI). See, for
example, Calderwood, S.B., et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA
(1987) 84:4364-4368; Jackson, M.P., et al., Microb Pathog
(1987) 2:147-153; Strockbine, N.A., et al., J Bacteriol
(1988) 170:1116-1122.Additional members of the SLT family have
subsequently been isolated that can be distinguished
serologically, on the basis of gene sequence or host
specificity (Gannon, V.P.J., et al., J Gen Microbiol 
(1990) 136:1125-1135; Weinstein, D.L., et al., J
Bacteriol (1988) 170:4223-4230; Ito, H., et al., Microb
Pathog (1990) 8:47-60; Head, S.C., et al., FEMS Microbiol
Lett (1988) 51:211-216; Schmitt, C.K., et al., Infect
Immun (1991) 59:1065-1073; Scotland, S.M., et al. Lancet
(1985) ii:885-886; Oku, Y., et al., Microb Pathog (1989)
6:113-122. Various types of SLTII have been described
and have been assigned various designations depending on
the strain of E. coli from which they are isolated and
the hosts they inhabit. Thus, variants have been
designated SLTII; vtx2ha; SLTIIvh; vtx2hb; SLTIIc;
SLTIIvp and so forth.All of the SLT's are multimeric proteins
composed of an enzymatic (A) subunit and multiple (B)
subunits responsible for toxin binding to receptors on
host tissues. The binding B oligomers of SLTI, SLTII and
SLTIIvh recognize host cell globoseries glycolipid
receptors containing at minimum the disaccharide subunit
aGal(1-4)βGal at the non-reducing terminus; SLTIIvp has
been shown to bind to the receptors containing this
subunit but not necessarily at the non-reducing end
