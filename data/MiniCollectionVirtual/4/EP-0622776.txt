<CLAIMS>
Electromagnetic signal horn having a housing (1), and
having a diaphragm (2) which in its edge regions is connected

to the housing (1) and which together with the housing (1)
forms a chamber (3), and having an electromagnetic actuator (4)

arranged within the chamber (3), and having an armature (5)
which is arranged within the chamber (3) and which has an

attachment pin (6) that passes through a central opening (11)
of the diaphragm (2), and having a connecting channel which

connects the chamber (3) with the outside and which has a
radial recess in the central opening (11) of the diaphragm (2),

characterised in that the central opening (11) is a polygonal
hole whose spacing (A) between its sides is slightly larger

than the diameter (D) of the attachment pin (6).
Electromagnetic signal horn according to claim 1,
characterised in that the central opening (11) is a four sided

hole.
Electromagnetic signal horn according to claim 1,
characterised in that a diaphragm support surface (8) of the

armature (5) has a radial groove (9).
Electromagnetic signal horn according to claim 1,
characterised in that a diaphragm support surface (8) of the

armature (5) has a circular channel (10) arranged on the
attachment pin (6).
Electromagnetic signal horn according to claim 1,
characterised in that a disc (12) is provided on the side of

the diaphragm (2) remote from the armature (5), the disc (12)
having a further radial groove (13). 
Electromagnetic signal horn according to claim 5,
characterised in that the disc (12) has a plurality of further

radial grooves (13, 14) arranged on opposite sides of the
disc (12) and angularly offset with respect to each other.
Electromagnetic signal horn according to claim 6,
characterised in that the disc (12) has two further radial

grooves (13, 14) arranged offset by 180 degrees with respect to
each other.
Electromagnetic signal horn according to claim 1,
characterised in that the armature (5) is connected to the

diaphragm (2) by means of an upset portion (15) of the
attachment pin (6).
Electromagnetic signal horn according to claim 1,
characterised in that the signal horn is a trumpet having a

bell mouth arranged downstream of the diaphragm (2).
