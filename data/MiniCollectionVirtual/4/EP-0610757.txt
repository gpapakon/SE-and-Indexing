<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a totally enclosed electrical machine with at least one internal fan, which both in the stator (4) and in the rotor (2) is respectively provided [lacuna] baffle plate (10) directing flow openings (6) of the stator (4) which extend continuously from one to the other end of the machine. The effect of the baffle plate is to achieve a directed guidance of the cooling air, and thus an improvement in the cooling of the machine.

<CLAIMS>
Closed electrical machine with at least one 
internal fan, the machine having both in the stator (4) 

and in the rotor (2) in each case flow openings (6 and 
20) extending continuously from the one machine side to 

the other machine side, and where in the area between 
the internal fan (9) and the relevant stator side there 

is provided an air guide (10) which directs the stream 
of outgoing air of the internal fan (9) to the flow 

openings (6) of the stator (4). 
Electrical machine according to claim 1, where 
salient poles and pole gaps (6) lying between them are 

provided in the stator (4) and where the air guide has 
openings (15) in each case in the area opposite the 

pole gaps (6). 
Electrical machine according to claim 1 or 2, 
where as internal fan a radial-flow fan (9) is 

provided, in the radially internal intake area of which 
in the rotor (2) of the machine cooling channels (20), 

provided as flow openings, open and which in its 
circumferential area is overlapped by the air guide 

(10) in the radial direction. 
Electrical machine according to claim 3, where 
the p
art (16) of the air guide (10) overlapping with 
the radial-flow fan (9) extends in parallel with the 

contour present in this area of the radial-flow fan 
(9). 
Electrical machine according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, where at least the part (14) of 

the air guide (10) directing the stream of cooling air 
is constructed so that it points away in a sloping 

manner relative to the plane of the front side of the 
machine.
