<ABSTRACT>
Method of manufacturing a helical gear 
allowing strategic placement of a hardenable wear-resistant 

and high strength layer at predetermined 
locations on the gear. The method includes the steps of 

forming (24) a gear core preform having the general 
shape of the helical gear and positioning (26) the gear 

core preform within an elastomeric mold having the 
specific shape of the helical gear. The method also 

includes the steps of filling (26) the mold at the 
predetermined locations with the hardenable 

metallurgical material and densifying (28) the gear core 
preform and the metallurgical material. Lastly, the 

method also includes the step of heat treating (30) the 
densified gear core preform and metallurgical material, 

to obtain the helical gear having a wear-resistant layer 
at the predetermined locations. A helical gear (10) 

formed according to method is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of gears and,
more particularly, to a method for manufacturing fully
dense, powdered metal gears, especially helical gears.Many methods of making gears are known in the art. For
example, one method involves the use of mechanical or
isostatic pressing to compact powdered metal into a gear
shape which is then heat treated or sintered to impart certain
characteristics, such as improved hardness, to the gear.
Finally the gear can be forged with known forge equipment
to further increase density. Gear manufacture processes
such as this are described in United States patent numbers
3,394,432, 3,842,646, 3,891,367, 4,470,953, 4,585,619 and
4,710,345. United States patent number 4,708,912 discloses
a gear manufacturing process which utilises a blank instead
of powdered metal, and United States patent number
3,752,003 discloses a method of making a composite gear
Conventional methods exist to modify the above-described
gear manufacturing processes to obtain gears with hardened
surfaces, as disclosed in United States patent numbers
3,398,444 and 4,885,831. FR-A-2,043,622 describes a method
for manufacturing a gear in which a hardenable metallic
material is applied to a gear core preform at predetermined 
locations, and is hardened to obtain a wear-resistant and
high strength layer.US-A-3 665 585 describes a method in which a gear core
and wear resistant layer are made separately by sintering;
thereafter they are joined together in an assembly operation.EP-A-384 629 describes a method in which the wear resistant
layer is formed as a green powder preform; it is then attached
to the core body, and the preform together with the core
body are heated in a sealed container to sinter, cure and bond
the preform to the core body.Certain gear shapes, such as helical gear shapes, present
problems that render production of such gears by the
conventional processes described above very difficult and
very costly. It would be desirable to 
develop a process for manufacturing these gear shapes
which would allow for the use of certain composite
materials which would produce the desired response to
rapid heat treatment, such as by induction.It would also be desirable that the composite
materials at the same time possess the needed properties
of hardness and residual stress profile for superior
performance in bending and contact fatigue. Still
further, it would be desirable to develop a method of
gear manufacture which allows for the placement of
special wear resistant layers at
