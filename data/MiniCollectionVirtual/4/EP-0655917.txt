<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sterile,
particulate-free crystalline S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)
ethyl dihydrogen phosphorothioate (amifostine)
formulations which provide improved stability.The compound S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethyl
dihydrogen phosphorothioate (which is also known as
amifostine, ethiofos, Ethyol®, NSC 296961, and WR-2721
and which will hereinafter be referred to as
"amifostine") and other aminoalkyl dihydrogen
phosphorothioates are disclosed in United States
patent No. 3,892,824 to Piper etal. This patent also
discloses the known process for making a crystalline
form of amifostine drug substance.
This crystalline form of
amifostine has been shown to be relatively stable at
room temperature for several years as well as at 50°C
for several months. These compounds were originally
developed as antiradiation agents (radioprotectants),
in particular to be used against x-ray or nuclear
radiation which may be encountered during military
conflicts.In addition to its utility as a military
antiradiation agent, amifostine has demonstrated
excellent utility as a non-military radioprotectant
and chemoprotectant i.e., as a protectant for the
undesirable adverse effects which arise during the use
of radiation therapy in the treatment of cancer and
the use of chemotherapeutic agents, for example,
alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide, cisplatin,
carboplatin, doxorubicin and its derivatives, and 
mitomycin and its derivatives. Similarly, it has been reported that amifostine has
been used experimentally to protect HIV infected patients (AIDS) from the harmful
side effects of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) therapy. Amifostine and its
derivatives exert their protective effects without significantly affecting therapeutic
agents. This is in part due to the selective uptake of the protective thiol into normal
tissue.As used herein, the term "amifostine drug substance" refers to its pre-vacuum
dried state which is available on an "as is" basis in a trihydrate form.
Currently available sterile, vacuum dried formulations of amifostine drug product
will be referred to as "amorphous", whereas the form covered by the present
invention will be referred to as "crystalline amifostine" in order to distinguish
between the two forms. Unless otherwise specified, quantities reported herein shall
be calculated on an anhydrous basis.Although amifostine has many advantageous properties, extensive difficulty
has been encountered in trying to obtain a convenient, stable, sterile dosage
formulation.The present manner of
