<ABSTRACT>
The properties of polyphenylene ether-polyarylene sulphide mixtures are 
improved by the addition of an agent as is known for the improvement of the 

properties of polyphenylene ether-polyamide mixtures, such as c copolymer of 
a vinylaromatic compound and an alpha-beta unsaturated dicarboxylic acid 

(anhydride).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a polymer mixture comprising a polyphenylene 
ether, a polyarylene sulphide and an agent to improve the homogeneity as used 
for poluphenylene ether-polyamide polymer mixtures. Such polymer mixtures 
are described in various patent publications:
 
US-A-4,021,596; JP-A-55/129422 (see WPI Acc. No.
 
80-83415 C/47); JP-A-62/065351 (see WPI Acc. No.
 
80-120241/17); JP-A-55/135160 (see WPI Acc. No.
 
80-87164C/49); JP-A-50/156,561 (see CA, Vol. 84, 1976, 
page 35, No. 84 : 106514 v). Polymer mixtures comprising a polyphenylene ether and a polyarylene 
sulphide have a combination of properties which each of the individual 
components does not have, for example, a combination of certain mechanical 
properties, a good resistance against organic solvents, a better processability 
and flame-retarding properties. In accordance with the desired combination of 
properties, the two polymers were used in a variety of mixing natios. The disadvantage of the known polymer mixtures is that the two 
polymers do not form a homogeneous mixture. Products manufactured, for 
example, from these polymer mixtures by injection moulding, show a tendency 
of delamination. This often leads to a surface having pearl gloss. It also often 
appears that the addition of further additives, for example, agents to improve 
the impact strength, to non-homogeneous polymer mixtures, only results in a 
small improvement of the properties. The invention provides polymer mixtures which have a beter 
homogeneity. The invention is based on the discovery vinylaromatic copolymers as 
defined in claim 1 are suitable to improve the homogeneity of the polymer 
mixtures according to the invention.  The polymer mixture according to the invention is characterised in that it 
comprises as an agent to improve the homogeneity a copolymer with units of a 
vinylaromatic compound and of an alpha-beta unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or 
dicarboxylic acid anhydride or a copolymer with units of a vinylaromatic 
compound and of an imide compound of an alpha-beta unsaturated dicarboxylic 
acid, in a quantity of 0.5 to 100 parts by weight of polyarylene sulphide plus 
polyphenylene ether. The agents to improve the homogeneity are also referred to as an agent 
to improve the compatibility or as an agent to improve the properties. All the known agents to improve the homogeneity c.q. compatibility of 
polyphenylene ether-polyamide mixtures have a chemical group which most 
likely can react with the amine and/or amide group in the polyamide.
