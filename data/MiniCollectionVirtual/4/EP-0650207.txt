Provided are a method for preparing a nickel 
hydroxide for a nickel electrode, which comprises solidly 

dissolving ions of other metals than nickel in a 
nickel hydroxide, 

and then eluting a partial amount of the metal ions from the nickel 
hydroxide; and a method for manufacturing a nickel 

electrode, which comprises filling a porous current 
collector with an active material paste consisting 

mainly of the resulting nickel hydroxide, and an 
alkaline secondary battery which incorporates the 

nickel electrode as a positive electrode therein. 
This nickel hydroxide restrains deformation or 
expansion of the nickel electrode and lowering of the 

discharge capacity of the battery despite repeated 
charge/discharge operation of the battery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a preparing
method for a nickel hydroxide used as an active
material for a nickel electrode, operating as a
positive electrode in an alkaline secondary battery, a
manufacturing method for the nickel electrode using
this nickel hydroxide, and an alkaline secondary
battery incorporating this nickel electrode as its
positive electrode therein. More specifically, the
invention relates to a preparing method for a nickel
hydroxide adapted for use as an active material for a
positive electrode, operating as a positive electrode
in an alkaline secondary battery and enjoying
satisfactory discharge characteristics and cycle life
performance.Recently, nickel-hydride secondary batteries have
become the object of public attention as high-capacity
alkaline secondary batteries. The batteries of this
type act with hydrogen as an active material for a
negative electrode, and have negative and positive
electrodes arranged in layers with a separator between
them. The negative electrode is formed of a current
collector and a hydrogen-occlusive alloy which can
reversibly occlude and release hydrogen, being 
supported on the current collector, while the positive
electrode is formed of a similar current collector and
nickel hydroxide as an active material for a positive
electrode, being supported on the current collector.
The negative and positive electrodes constitute an
electricity generating element, which is disposed in
an alkaline electrolyte, such as potassium hydroxide,
and the whole structure is sealed.A sintered nickel electrode has been the
prevailing material for the positive electrode of
these batteries. In this nickel electrode, a current
collector made of sintered body of nickel powder is
filled with an active material compound which consists
mainly of nickel hydroxide which is an active material
for a positive electrode. In this case, however, the
packing density of the activating material compound is
low because the sintered nickel material as the
current collector has a low porosity. Accordingly,
this nickel electrode cannot effectively meet the
recent demand for higher-capacity alkaline secondary
batteries.Recently, therefore, the following nickel
electrode has been developed for use as a positive
electrode.The nickel electrode is formed as follows. A
powder of nickel hydroxide, conductive material powder
such as nickel powder or cobalt powder, and a binding
powder such as polytetrafluoroethylene powder are
mixed in predetermined ratios. A given amount of a
thickener such as
