<ABSTRACT>
A four-stroke internal combustion engine is described in which the piston is axially and rotatably supported in the cylinder. A helically wound positive guide, which for one 360 DEG  revolution impresses four axial reciprocating movements on the piston for the four working strokes, is provided between piston and cylinder. In their peripheral walls bordering on their adjacent faces, the cylinder and the piston each have a combustion chamber half, which at the moment of ignition of the combustion gas complement one another to form a combustion chamber, so that the combustion gas expanding in the combustion chamber exerts a torque on the piston. The piston transmits its rotational movement directly by means of a shaft shank of polygonal cross-section to a drive shaft, which accommodates the shaft shank so that it is axially movable and rotationally fixed.

A four-stroke internal combustion engine of the piston type including at 
least one cylinder for slidingly and sealingly receiving a cylindrical piston, a work 

space being provided on one workside between an end wall of the cylinder and the 
adjacent end wall of the piston, an inlet opening communicating with an inlet passage 

for feeding combustion gas into the work space, an outlet opening communicating 
with an outlet passage for discharging exhaust gas from the work space, and 

valve means for opening and closing said inlet and outlet openings in conformity 
with the work strokes, the piston (10) being mounted in the cylinder (2) for axial 

and rotary movements and a serpentine guide means (20) being provided between 
the piston (10) and the cylinder (2) for causing the piston (10) to perform four axial 

work strokes when rotating about 360Â°, and a shaft stub (14a) coaxial to the piston 
(10) being provided for outputting the rotary movement of the piston (10), characterized 

in that the cylinder (2) and the piston (10), at their peripheral walls in the 
area of their adjacent end faces, each comprise one combustion chamber portion 

(32, 34) which combine to form a combustion chamber (30) at the time when the 
combustion gas is being ignited such that the combustion gas expanding in the combustion 

chamber (30) exerts a torque upon the piston (10). 
A four stroke internal combustion engine according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said guide means (20) comprises a serpentine groove (22) of semicircular 

cross-section in the peripheral wall of the piston (10) and a pair of diametrically 
opposite balls (24) mounted in the peripheral wall (4) of the cylinder (2) and engaging 

into the groove (22) of the piston (10). 
A four stroke internal combustion engine according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the two combustion chamber portions (32, 34) each are of 

substantially triangular shape in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder so 
as to form a rectangular combustion chamber (30) having a drive surface (34') in the 

piston (10) transverse to the circumferential direction and a reaction surface (32') in 
the cylinder (2) substantially parallel thereto.  

 
A four stroke internal combustion engine according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said shaft stub (14a) is mounted in a drive shaft (16a) 

so as to be axially movable and to be prevented from rotary movements for compensating 
for the axial movements of the piston (10) and for outputting the rotary movements 

of the piston (10), which drive shaft is mounted in the cylinder (2) so as to be 
rotatable and to be prevented from performing axial movements. 
A four stroke internal combustion engine according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the shaft stub (14a) and the drive shaft (16a) are of angular, preferably 

hexagonal or octogonal cross-section. 
A four stroke internal combustion engine according to claim 4 or claim 5, 
characterized in that each side of the piston (10) includes a shaft stub (14a, 14b) and 

a drive shaft (16a, 16b). 
A four stroke internal combustion engine according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the valve means comprises a valve flange (48a) including 

a valve slot (54a) extending through the valve flange which is mounted in the 
end wall (6a) of the cylinder (2) so as to be rotatable along with the piston (10) such 

that the valve flange (48a) together with the valve slot (54a) is arranged to open and 
close the inlet and outlet openings (38, 42) in timed relationship to the work strokes. 
A four stroke internal combustion engine according to claims 4 and 7, 
characterized in that, for sealing purposes, to prevent leakage losses, a sealing disk 

(50a) having a valve slot (52a) extending therethrough is mounted in a recess of the 
valve flange (48a) so as to be axially movable and is arranged to be urged against 

the adjacent end wall (6a) of the cylinder (2) by springs (54a) supported against the 
valve flange (48a), an axial projection which extends about the valve slot (54a) of 

the valve flange (48a) being slidingly received in the valve slot (52a) of the sealing 
disk (50a). 
A four stroke internal combustion engine according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a rear work space (9) is provided between the piston 

(10) and the cylinder (2) on its rearside remote from the work side.  
 
A four stroke internal combustion engine according to claim 9, characterized 
in that the rear work space (9) communicates with the inlet passage (36) and 

the outlet passage (40) by respective return conduits (60, 62) such that a portion of 
the exhaust gas from the outlet passage (40) is refed into the rear work space (9) and 

from there, along with fresh combustion gas, via the inlet passage (36) into the work 
space (8) on the work side. 
A four stroke internal combustion engine according to any of the preceding 
claims in connection with claim 4, characterized in that the drive shaft (16a) is 

coupled to the piston of a further cylinder. 
A four stroke combustion engine according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it is of the Otto-type and that an ignition means (36) is 

disposed in the combustion chamber portion (32) of the cylinder (2).
