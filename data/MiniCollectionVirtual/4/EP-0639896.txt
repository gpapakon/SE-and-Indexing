<ABSTRACT>
A code-division multiple-access (CDMA) net can be used for efficiently carrying 
various types of traffic having different requirements, such as voice traffic and ISDN 

traffic. When a station requests a channel, the controller determines the quality level 
required by that station and calculates the appropriate power level for that station on 

the basis of the required quality level. At the same time it recalculates the power 
levels for the stations already having operative channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to code-division multiple access (CDMA) nets,
and more particularly to methods of operation of and controllers for such nets.The use of code division is well known as a means of managing multiple
access to a medium such as a radio band or optical fibre. For example, see Klein S.
Gilhousen, On the Capacity of a Cellular CDMA System ― IEEE Trans. on
Vehicular Technology, vol. 40, no. 2, May 1991, pages 303-312. In such a system
each subscriber is allocated a code which is used to encode the signal prior to
transmission. The technique which will be particularly discussed in this
specification is known as 'direct-sequence code-division multiple access' (DS-CDMA).
In this technique the traffic bearer is multiplied by a serial code at a rate
known as the 'chip rate' (W) which is greater than the bit rate (R) by some factor
(W/R) known as the 'spreading gain'. The resulting signal is recovered, in the
presence of other co-frequency signals, by correlation with the spreading code. The
codes allocated to different subscribers are chosen for their orthogonal properties to
minimise cross-talk. In practice, however, non-ideal implementation, for example
the difficulty or impossibility of maintaining exact synchronisation between the
codes, makes true orthogonality impossible to achieve, and unwanted co-frequency
channels manifest themselves as noise power in the wanted channel.When a station requests a channel, the controller sets up the channel,
which includes synchronising the code at the controller and the station and then,
while the channel remains in operation, controlling the power level of the station so
that the received power levels from all the stations with operative channels are the
same. A method and apparatus for controlling transmission power in a CDMA
net as set out in the preambles of the independent claims are disclosed in WO-A-9221196.Klein S. Gilhousen and others in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular
Technology, vol. 40, no. [2], May 1991, pages 303-312 discuss the capacity of a cellular
CDMA system, disclosing equation (1) below.A method and a controller according to the invention are as set out in the
independent claims. Preferred forms are set out in the dependent claims. We have found that a CDMA net can be efficiently used to carry a
variety of different types of traffic, such as voice and ISDN data services which have
widely differing bit rates and/or error rate requirements. One application of such a
net would be as a radio local loop for a telecommunications network.An

in step (a) the quality level required by the type of traffic to be carried for
said station is determined, and power levels (C

levels of said other stations are adjusted in accordance with said determined power

levels.

level comprises retrieving a predetermined quality level associated with said station

from a table.
