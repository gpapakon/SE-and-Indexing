<ABSTRACT>
Gas generator having an essentially cylindrical or tubular structure containing a solid propellant or fuel for ignition in a combustion chamber by means of an electrically actuable ignition device, having filtering means for cooling and filtering the gas which has been generated before it emerges to inflate a restraining means such as an airbag, the structure being composed of:   - a combustion chamber cylinder 5 which is open at one end and at the other end has both a central ignition device 8 with an electrical connection 1 and a peripheral holding and centring ring 8, - a prefabricated filter 2 which can be inserted into the combustion chamber cylinder 5 and is especially intended for preliminary filtering and cooling, the said filter 2 essentially taking the form of a strip which covers apertures 11 over part of the circumference of the combustion chamber cylinder, - a second tubular prefabricated filter 20 which (concentrically) encloses the combustion chamber cylinder, is held in an external container 19 made of sheet metal with gas outlets 10 and is held fast both peripherally and by its end face on the combustion chamber cylinder 5 between the holding and centring ring 3, which is mounted on the closed end face, and on the other side a lid 4 having a positive locking area for the tubular filter 20.

<CLAIMS>
A tubular gas generator, comprising

a) an outer housing (19) of sheet metal, with gas exit ports
(10),
b) a combustion chamber cylinder (5) arranged in the outer
housing (19) and containing solid propellant (16) for

generating a gas, the combustion chamber cylinder (5)
comprising an open end face and opposite thereto an end face

having a central igniter (6, 7, 8), and comprising openings
(11) in a partial area of its periphery for the passage of the

gas,
c) a cover (4) closing off the open end face of the combustion
chamber cylinder (5),
d) a holding and centering ring (3) formed at the opposite end
face on the periphery of the outer housing (19), for securing

the gas generator to a structure in a vehicle,
e) a first filter (2) inserted between the solid propellant
(16) and the openings (11), and
f) a second, tubular filter (20) which surrounds the combustion
chamber cylinder (5) and which is retained between the cover

and a stop (21) formed on the other end face of the combustion
chamber cylinder (5),
characterized in that
 
the gas generator further comprises a tubular element which

abuts against the inside of the housing for securing the second
filter (20), the tubular element having bent portions (26)

which direct the gas towards a fine filter (27) arranged
upstream of the gas exit ports (10), that the first filter (2)

is essentially stripe-shaped, and that the cover (4) comprises
a shoulder (22) for an interlocking fit with the second filter

(20), and the stop (21) is formed by flanging the outer housing
(19).
The gas generator according to claim 1, characterized in
that the holding and centering ring comprises a positioning

nose (25).
The gas generator according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the fine filter (27) is a wire fabric.
The gas generator according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the first filter is supported by

shoulders (23) in the combustion chamber cylinder and is guided
in the longitudinal direction.
The gas generator according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the combustion chamber cylinder

(5) and the end face comprising the igniter (6, 7, 8) are
integrally formed with each other.
