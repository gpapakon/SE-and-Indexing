<ABSTRACT>
A solid preparation soluble in the buccal cavity, 
which is composed of a sugar comprising lactose and/or manitol and 0.1-1.2 w/w%, 

based on the sugar, of agar and an active ingredient and has a density of 
400-1,000 mg/ml and such a strength as to withstand the handling in the manufacture thereof. 

It has such a sufficient practical solubility in the buccal cavity that even the aged or children having 
difficulty in swallowing a solid preparation, such as a tablet, can take it. It has an exceedingly high 

strength as compared with conventional open matrix structures and hence can withstand satisfactorily 
carrying and PTP packaging.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid preparation which has a practically sufficient strength for the handling
similar to the case of common tablets and also has a practically sufficient solubility or disintegration
property in the buccal cavity, and to a process for producing the same.Since dosage forms in which easy swallowing by patients is taken into consideration are scarce in spite
of the existence of various known dosage forms of pharmaceutical preparations for oral administration use,
great concern has been directed toward the development of a dosage form which can be easily handled
especially by the aged or children having difficulty in swallowing a solid preparation.For example, in the case of tablets and capsules frequently used as oral preparations, many patients of
the aged or children having weak swallowing power are unwilling to take these solid preparations
complaining that the drug is difficult to swallow or stops in the pharynx or gullet.In the case of powders and granules, they are difficult to swallow because of their aptness to remain in
the buccal cavity and therefore to cause a unpleasant feeling in the mouth. In some cases, the aged will be
choked with powders or feel a pain or unpleasantness due to granules gotten in between false teeth. In
addition, powders and granules have to be used after tearing each package, but the aged or children often
have difficulty in tearing the package or spill a portion of its contents.To take these oral preparations, it is necessary to use water, and the aged or children especially require
a large volume of water in many cases because of the swallowing difficulty. However, there is a situation
that it is necessary to drink water moderately, especially before retire to bed because of the urination
problem at night. In addition, in the case of patients who have to take oral preparations constantly while
making daily life, water can hardly be obtained in certain cases depending on circumstances, thus
sometimes entailing decline in the compliance.Syrups and the like are regarded as desirable dosage forms for the aged or children, but the aged or
children who have difficulty in measuring the necessary volume cannot be expected to use such
preparations in correct dose. In addition, since there are many aged patients who can hardly take liquid
preparations to mouths by themselves, such dosage forms cannot always be regarded as suitable dosage
forms for the aged and children when trouble at the time of drug-taking is taken into consideration, except
for a
