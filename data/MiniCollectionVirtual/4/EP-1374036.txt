<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a digital signal processor architecture that is designed to speed up frequently-used signal processing computations, such as FIR filters, correlations, FFTs and DFTs. The architecture uses a coupled dual-MAC architecture (MAC1), (MAC2) and attaches a dual-MAC coprocessor (MAC3), (MAC4) onto it in a unique way to achieve a significant increase in processing capability.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DSP WITH DUAL-MAC PROCESSOR AND DUAL-MAC COPROCESSORBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical Field[1001] This invention relates to digital signal processors, and has particular relation to multiply-accumulate (MAC) units.Background Art[1002] Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) are specialized types of . microprocessors that are specifically tailored to execute mathematical computations very rapidly. DSPs can be found in a variety of applications including compact disk players, PC disk drives, telecommunication modem banks, and cellular telephones.[1003] In the cellular telephone context, the demand for DSP computation capability continues to grow, driven by the increasing needs of applications such as GPS position location, voice recognition, low-bit rate speech and audio coding, image and video processing, and 3G cellular modem processing. To meet these processing demands, there is a need for improved digital signal processor architectures that can process computations more efficiently.[1004] .Considerable work has been done in these areas.
