<ABSTRACT>
In a tyre retreading apparatus, a tread rubber can be applied to a carcase, with a tread-rubber feeding device for feeding the tread rubber to the carcase and with an extruder for the extrusion of a layer of bonding rubber. The apparatus has two lips which bound an extrusion die and of which the rear lip, in the direction of movement of the carcase, projects towards the carcase with respect to the other lip. The lip closer to the carcase (13) is designed as a moulding shoe (40) and is pressed against the carcase (13) under prestress deforming the said carcase.

A retreading apparatus for tyres, in which a tread 
strip can be applied to a carcass, having a tread-feeding 

device for feeding the tread to the carcass and having an 
extruder for extruding a cushion gum layer, which extruder 

has two lips defining an extrusion die, the rear lip of 
which in the direction of movement of the carcass projects 

towards the carcass in relation to the other lip, 
characterised in that the lip nearer to the carcass (13) is 

in the form of an applicator shoe (40) and is pressed 
against the carcass (13) under preloading which deforms said 

carcass. 
A retreading apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the applicator shoe (40) has a chamfer 

or bevel (42) which extends towards the carcass surface at 
an angle of 2° to 50°, preferably between 10° and 30°. 
A retreading apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the applicator shoe 

(40) projects by three to fifteen times, in particular 
approximately ten times, the thickness of the cushion gum 

layer (15) in relation to the other lip (41) of the 
extruder (10). 
A retreading apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that between the 

applicator shoe (40) and the lip (41) a clear width is 
provided which exceeds the thickness of the cushion gum 

layer (15) by two to twelve times, in particular 
approximately eight times. 
A retreading apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the applicator shoe 

(40) has a radius of curvature which is equal to or greater  
 

than the maximum radius of the carcass surface or is 
substantially straight over its entire width. 
A retreading apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the extruder (10) 

heats the cushion gum only to a temperature which is within 
the range of the calendering temperature of, for example, 

slightly less than 80°C or corresponds thereto or is slightly 
higher, wherein at an extruder temperature of approximately 

85°C an alarm sensor is provided for a limit value of 
approximately 90°C. 
A retreading apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that, viewed over the 

width of the carcass, the die orifice of the extruder 
(40,41) is of varying chamfer (42), wherein in particular 

the applicator shoe (40) has a positive or negative 
curvature in the die orifice so that the chamfer (42) is 

greatest at the tyre centre or on the tyre flanks. 
A retreading apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the cushion gum has 

an adhesion to the carcass (13) and a viscosity such that it 
is conveyed counter the pressing force of the applicator 

shoe (40) into a gap formed by the cushion gum layer (15) 
between the carcass (13) and the applicator shoe (40). 
A retreading apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the supply of the 

cushion gum through the extruder (10) is electronically 
controlled, wherein a cushion gum roll being formed on the 

opposite side of the applicator shoe (40) is used as an 
indicator and is always maintained by the supply of new 

cushion gum at a level such that any depressions and damage 
to the carcass surface can always be completely filled. 
A retreading apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that in the vicinity of 

the die orifice of the extruder (10) the applicator shoe  
 

(40) can additionally be heated with a heating element (43) 
acting briefly during the application of the cushion gum 

layer (15). 
A retreading apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that in particular heated 

side flank forming members (46,47) laterally adjoin the in 
particular unheated applicator shoe (40), wherein the 

distance apart of the forming members can be adjusted via an 
adjusting means to conform to different carcass widths and 

the side flank forming members guide a cushion gum roll 
according to the configuration of the applicator shoe (40). 
A method of retreading a tyre, in which cushion gum 
is applied to a carcass (13) via an extruder which has two 

lips defining an extrusion die, characterised in that the 
rear lip in the direction of movement is in the form of an 

applicator shoe (40) and the applicator shoe (40) of the die 
orifice of the extruder (10) is pressed so strongly against 

the carcass that the radius of curvature of the carcass (13) 
is adapted to the applicator shoe (40) and any depressions 

in the carcass (13) can be filled with a free excess of 
cushion gum. 
A method according to Claim 12, characterised in 
that the extruder (10) heats the cushion gum only to a 

temperature which is within the range of the calendering 
temperature of, for example, slightly less than 80°C or 

corresponds thereto or is slightly higher, an alarm being 
given at an extruder temperature of approximately 85°C for a 

limit value of approximately 90°C. 
A method according to Claim 12 or 13, characterised 
in that the cushion gum has an adhesion to the carcass (13) 

and a viscosity such that it is conveyed counter the 
pressing force of the applicator shoe (40) into a gap formed 

by the cushion gum layer (15) between the carcass (13) and 
the applicator shoe (40).  

 
A method according to any one of Claims 12 to 14, 
characterised in that the supply of the cushion gum
 through 
the extruder (10) is electronically controlled, wherein a 

cushion gum roll being formed on the opposite side of the 
applicator shoe (40) is used an indicator and is always 

maintained by the supply of new cushion gum at a level such 
that any depressions and damage to the carcass surface can 

always be completely filled. 
A method according to any one of Claims 12 to 15, 
characterised in that initially the rotation of the carcass 

(13) is commenced just before the activation of the extruder 
(10) and then the cushion gum layer (15) is built up from a 

thin layer which just covers the roughness of the carcass 
surface, and in that the extrusion rate is decreased after 

one complete revolution of the carcass (13) so that the 
cushion gum excess is reduced to zero upon completion of the 

cushion gum layer (15).
