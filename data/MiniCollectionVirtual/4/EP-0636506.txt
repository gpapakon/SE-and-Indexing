<ABSTRACT>
A transfer case for a part-time four wheel drive 
vehicle includes a planetary gear speed reduction 

assembly driven by the transfer case input shaft for 
providing high and low speed range outputs. The 

planetary gear assembly is disposed between and is 
selectively engaged by primary and secondary clutch 

collars, the primary clutch driving the rear (primary) 
output shaft in either the high or low speed ranges. 

The secondary clutch drives the front (secondary) 
output shaft through a chain drive in the low range. 

The clutch collars are controlled by a single (common) 
clutch operator. An electromagnetic clutch assembly 

driven by the input shaft selectively drives the front 
output shaft chain drive. The electromagnetic clutch 

functions both as a synchronizer and torque delivery 
device. The transfer case may be combined with a 

control which facilitates direct selection of vehicle 
drive mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a power transfer assembly 
for delivering torque to a primary drive line and a secondary drive 
line and more particularly, but not exclusively, to  
 
a transfer case 
for incorporation into a four wheel drive vehicle and 
having a planetary 
gear speed reduction assembly for providing high and 
low speed range outputs and a plurality of clutches for 
selectively engaging the direct and reduced speed 
output of the planetary gear assembly to a pair of 
output shafts. The transfer case may be controlled by 
a direct or target shift control. The advantages of four wheel drive in light 
trucks, sport utility vehicles, off road vehicles and 
passenger cars are generally acknowledged. Improved 
vehicle stability and control extends the vehicle 
safety envelope when road conditions are wet, snowy or 
icy, for example, and extends the terrain capabilities 
in off road applications. Every signpost does not point toward four wheel 
drive, however. Because of their complexity and 
increased frictional losses, fuel economy of a vehicle 
operating in four wheel drive will generally be lower 
than that of the same vehicle operating in two wheel 
drive or of a comparable two wheel drive vehicle. Such increased fuel consumption is also the result 
of additional weight of four wheel drive systems. The 
weight increase may be significant if the system is 
intended for full time operation due to the necessary 
greater durability of the components whereas the weight 
penalty may be somewhat less if the four wheel drive 
components are intended only for limited, part-time 
use.  
 While most proponents of four wheel drive 
acknowledge that the need for and benefits of four 
wheel drive systems are infrequent and thus that four 
wheel drive systems which primarily utilize two driving 
wheels and which may be shifted into four wheel drive 
by the vehicle operator or by a control system 
satisfies most four wheel drive demands, such 
proponents will then also acknowledge that the design 
of such intermittent four wheel drive systems focuses 
attention on the mechanical components which effect the 
shift from two wheel drive to four wheel drive and, if 
it is an automatically engaging system, its control 
system. Part-time four wheel drive trains and vehicles 
exhibit diverse operational features. For example, 
whereas certain drive systems and vehicles may be 
shifted from two wheel drive to four wheel drive at 
speed, that is, on-the-fly, other must be at a full 
stop before such shifts
