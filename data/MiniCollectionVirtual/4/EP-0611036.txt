<ABSTRACT>
When an automatic circuit tester (10) detects that a fault has 
occurred in a circuit board (14), it applies to the circuit board (14) a 

sequence of vectors that differs from the test sequence (T
n
, T
n+1
) by 
which the fault detection occurs only in that each vector's component 

that corresponds to an input pin in question on the board device under 
test maintains a level that simulates an open circuit at that input pin. If 

the resultant response differs from the response to the original test 
sequence, the input pin can often be ruled out as one at which a fault has 

occurred. In this way, many open-circuit faults at input pins can be diagnosed 
without special probing, even when several such faults occur 

simultaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to diagnosing faults on printed-circuit
boards that result from open circuits in the connections to the
input pins of devices mounted on such boards.Many assembled printed-circuit boards embody enormously complex
electronic circuitry. A board can thus have any one of a very large
number of different types of possible faults, for which the assembled
printed-circuit board must be tested. From the standpoint of circuit
operation, the largest part of the complexity, of course, results from the
internal organizations of the various devices mounted on the board,
many of which incorporate thousands of transistors apiece. Despite
these devices' internal complexity, however, the overwhelming majority
of the faults encountered in the testing of complex printed-circuit boards
result not from the internal operations of the devices themselves but
rather from improper device mounting, and many of the device-mounting
problems result from bad solder connections or other sources
of open circuits.To test it for these and other faults, a circuit board is typically
placed on a "bed of nails" array of probes, which simultaneously contact
various nodes on the board. By means of these probes, sequences of test
vectors, i.e., of sets of node signals, are applied at some nodes, the
resultant response is sensed at other nodes, and the board is declared
faulty if the sensed signals differ from the nominal response that a good
board would produce.Once the tester has determined that the board is faulty, it is often
desirable for it also to be able to diagnose the fault, i.e., to determine 
not only that a fault exists but also what that fault is. While almost all
types of faults can readily be detected by such automatic circuit testing,
many types of faults tend to evade diagnosis: the tester can detect the
fault affect but cannot identify the fault that caused it. Some simple
open circuits are among faults of that type. Most open circuits in the
connections of device output pins can readily be detected: stimuli are
applied that cause the signal at the output pin in question to change, and
the resultant signals are observed on a node to which that output pin
should be connected. If no change occurs, of course, then the fault has
been diagnosed. Because of certain complicating factors, diagnoses of
this type may not be possible in every case, but most open circuits on
output nodes can be diagnosed automatically simply by bed-of-nails
probing.The same could not heretofore have been said of open
