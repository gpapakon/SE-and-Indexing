<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide an edge-protecting border which can be easily produced, is not susceptible to thermal changes in length and is of an increased stability, in particular dimensional stability, the invention provides a process for producing an edge-protecting border with an, in particular, plastic angle profile having two legs which are positioned one upon the other and to which there are connected, to form the extension of the same, reinforcement mats, as corner reinforcement for a heat-insulating layer or masonry-wall corner bearing the fair-faced plaster, the reinforcement mats being fixed on the angle profile by heating the latter, and the border strips of the reinforcement mats projecting beyond the outer longitudinal borders of the angle profile. Said process is distinguished in that the extruder angle profile is provided with at least one bead on each of its legs, and the reinforcement mats, in particular reinforcement fabric, are fitted onto the beads, which have been softened by heating.

Process for the production of an edge-protecting border 
comprising an angular section particularly made of 

synthetic material with two lateral sides that are 
perpendicular to each other, with which reinforcement 

mats are connected prolonging said sides, where the 
edge-protecting border serves as corner reinforcement 

for a wall corner and bears face casting or a thermal 
layer, whereby the reinforcement mats are fastened on 

the angular section through heating of the angular 
section and the marginal strip of the reinforcement 

mats extend beyond the outer longitudinal edges of the 
angular section, characterized in that the angular 

section produced by means of extrusion is provided with 
at least one swelling on each of the lateral sides and 

the reinforcement mats, particularly reinforcement 
fabric, are placed within the swellings that are 

softened through heating. 
Process according to claim 1, chararcterized in that 
the reinforcement fabric is pressed in the swellings 

and both are rolled onto one another. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
angular section, during the extrusion, is provided with 

at least one swelling on each of its lateral sides and 
the swellings of the hardened angular section are  

 
heated. 
Process according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
heating of the swellings follows after the punching of 

holes on the lateral sides of the angular section. 
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
holes are punched above and below, that is, right and 

left of the swellings respectively. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that any 
of the swellings is completely heated and softened. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that any 
of the swellings is specifically heated and softened at 

a given point. 
Process according to any of the claims 1, 6 or 7, 
characterized in that the heating and softening of the 

swellings are effected by means of a laser. 
Process according to any of the claims 1, 6, or 7, 
characterized in that the heating and softening of the 

swellings are effected by means of a synthetic material 
welding device. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
after the extrusion the angular section is provided 

with at least one swelling on each of the lateral 
sides. 
Process according to claim 10, characterized in that 
the swellings are laid by means of the synthetic material 

welding device.  
 
Process according to claims 1 and 10, characterized in 
that the hardened angular section is heated before the 

laying of the swellings. 
Process according to claim 10, characterized in that 
the holes are punched before the laying of the swellings 

in the angular section. 
Process according to claim 13, characterized in that 
the swellings are placed between the holes on the 

angular section. 
Edge-protecting border comprising of an angular section 
particularly made of synthetic material with two lateral 

sides that are perpendicular to each other, with 
which reinforcement mats are connected prolongating 

said sides, where the edge-protecting border serves as 
corner reinforcement for a wall corner and bears face 

casting or a thermal layer, whereby the reinforcement 
mats are fastened on the angular section through heating 

of the angular section and the marginal strip of 
the reinforcement mats extend beyond the outer longitudinal 

edges of the angular section, characterized in 
that the angular section (2) exhibits at least one 

swelling (7, 8) on each of the lateral sides (3, 4), 
wherein the reinforcement mats, especially reinforcement 

fabric (11), are fastened, particularly attached, 
on the swellings (7, 8) of the angular section (2). 
Edge-protecting border according to claim 15, characterized 
in that the reinforcement fabric (11) is 

pressed into the swellings (7, 8) and has been rolled 
together therein.

in that the swellings (7) are arranged lineally, 

in essence parallel to the longitudinal edges (13, 
14) of the respective lateral sides (3, 4) on the 

respective lateral sides. 
Edge-protecting border according to claim 15, characterized 

in that the swellings (8) are arranged in the 
form of waves on the respective lateral sides (3, 4).
