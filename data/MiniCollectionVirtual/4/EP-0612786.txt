<ABSTRACT>
A block copolymer of generally an AB, ABA, or 
A(BA)
n
 structure, or mixtures thereof where the A block 
is an unsaturated polyester, the B block is a flexible 

polymer having a Tg of 0
o
C or lower, and n is 2 to 5. 
The various block components are generally first separately 

prepared as polymers with the flexible polymer 
generally having 1 or 2 functional end groups such as an 

amine group, a carboxyl group, or a hydroxyl group with 
the later being preferred. Alternatively, for low 

molecular weight unsaturated polyester blocks, the block 
can be made 
in situ
. The preferred reaction route is to 
react a mono or dihydroxy terminated flexible polymer 

with a diisocyanate which subsequently can be readily 
reacted with the polyester. The block copolymers can be 

utilized as toughening agents. They furthermore can be 
utilized to coat a fiber structure such as individual 

fibers, a woven structure, or a nonwoven structure such 
as mats, rovings, bundles, and the like, with the coated 

fiber structures subsequently incorporated into a 
polymeric matrix such as polyester.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyester-flexible 
polymer block copolymer having a high amount by 
weight of the flexible polymer segment therein. Heretofore, copolymers of polyester and 
elastomer have generally been made by polymerizing 
ester-forming monomers including mixtures of elastomeric 
prepolymers with ester-forming monomers, the result 
being the formation of a random polyester-elastomer 
copolymer containing elastomer segments therein. The 
structures of such copolymers are generally difficult to 
control and can be the result of side reactions, such as 
branching. The present invention relates to block copolymers 
generally of the ABA or AB structure or mixtures 
thereof where the B block is a flexible polymer or 
segment having a Tg of generally 0oC or less and preferably 
below minus 20oC, and may contain minor amounts of 
A(BA)n type block copolymers where n is 2 to 5, preferably 
2. The flexible black generally has one or two 
hydroxyl end groups, amine end groups, or carboxylic end 
groups and thus is monofunctional or difunctional. The 
A block is generally a specific class of unsaturated 
polyesters preferably having only a mono-, or less 
desirably a di-, hydroxyl, carboxylic, or amine end 
group. The polyester A block is generally linked to the 
flexible polymer B block through an ester, an amide, a 
urea, or a urethane group. A preferred linkage is a  
 
urethane linkage formed by reacting a hydroxyl terminated 
B flexible polymer with a diisocyanate and subsequently 
reacting the same with a monohydroxyl terminated 
A polyester. Alternatively, the hydroxy-terminated B 
polymer can be reacted with a cyclic anhydride and an 
oxirane using specific catalysts to give an ABA block 
copolymer. The copolymers of the present invention are 
true block copolymers in that they generally contain 
linear AB or ABA type structure and generally have 
little, if any, chain extension or branching structure. The B portion of the block copolymers of the 
present invention can generally be any flexible polymer. 
Such flexible polymers are generally defined as any 
polymer which has a Tg of about 0oC or less and preferably 
below minus 20oC, often are liquid, and are readily 
known in the art and to the literature, including the 
preparation thereof. One such class of flexible polymers is the 
various conjugated dienes made from one or more monomers 
having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, desirably from 4 to 8 
carbon atoms with 4 or 5 carbon atoms being preferred.
