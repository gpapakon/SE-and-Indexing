<ABSTRACT>
An improved organic-composite-plated steel plate produced by coating a chromated alloy-plated steel plate 
with a thermosetting resin and curing the coated plate, wherein the thermosetting resin comprises various water-base 

resin composition containing as the basic film-forming component a water-base vinyl-modified epoxy ester resin, a 
system composed of a water-based vinyl-modified epoxy ester resin and a blocked isocyanate compound or a system 

composed of a water-base vinyl-modified epoxy ester resin, a blocked isocyanate compound and colloidal silica. 
The invention can provide a novel and extremely practicable organic-composite-plated steel plate which comprises 

a metallic material precoated with a water-base organic composite coating resin (composition) without using a large 
quantity of an organic solvent and which is excellent in adhesion with adhesives, continuous weldability, corrosion 

resistance after working, and capability of electrodeposition coating, in close adhesion of coating material and corrosion 
resistance, particularly in image sharpness (flatness) of a coated surface after electrodeposition coating, and further in 

the resistance to rusting of adventitious origin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an organic composite-plated 
steel plate which is novel and useful, as well as to a 
resin composition for coating material which is used in the 
coating thereof. In greater detail, the present invention 
relates to an organic composite-plated steel plate, which is 
obtained by applying a specified organic resin or a composition 
containing a specified organic resin to a specified chromate-coated 
plated steel plate and curing this, which has in 
particular superior adhesion with adhesives, superior continuous 
welding properties, superior post-working corrosion resistance, 
superior electro-deposition coating properties, superior high 
corrosion resistance, and superior coating material adhesion, as 
well as to a resin composition for coating materials. In addition, it has been discovered that the mixture on the 
molecular level with the specified organic resin of a blocked 
isocyanate compound as a curing agent provides an organic 
composite-plated steel plate which has particularly superior 
rust resistance; the present invention provides an organic 
composite-plated steel plate having such a specified form. As a result of problems associated with organic solvents 
constituting in coating materials, such as the combustibility 
thereof, atmospheric pollution, worker safety, and sanitation  
 
problems, it has been hoped a rapid shift from organic-solvent-based 
coating materials to water-based coating materials. On the other hand, in the field of automobiles, steel 
household items, and household electrical appliances, the use of 
pre-coated metal materials has been increasing in order to 
improve productivity. Accordingly, in the field of surface preparation and 
coating, as well, in order to respond to such demands, various 
coating material compositions for use in pre-coated metal 
materials have been developed; however, in this field, as well, 
the shift from conventional organic-solvent-based coating 
materials to water-based coating materials is strongly desired. Furthermore, in systems employing conventional organic-solvent-based 
coating materials, in order to obtain the 
conductivity which is a necessary condition for conducting an 
electro-deposition coating, the inventions disclosed in, for 
example, Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication, No. 
Sho 45-2430 and Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication, 
No. Hei 4-6882, disclose zinc-rich coating materials. Such 
zinc-rich coating materials are capable of electro-deposition 
coating; however,
