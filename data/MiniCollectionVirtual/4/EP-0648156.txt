<ABSTRACT>
A moisture measurement device in a concrete manufacturing system, where a concrete mixer mixes gravel, cement, additives and water, comprises a control means (8, 30) for selectively opening a measurement door (51) in a measurement opening (52) in a gravel bin (1). The moisture contents in a gravel sample (55), which is fed from the measurement opening to a measurement container (41), is calculated in the control means by resistance measurement in the gravel sample in the measurement container. The water supply to the concrete mixer is thereafter adjusted in accordance with the measured moisture contents.

<DESCRIPTION>
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MEASURING MOISTURE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CONCRETEThe present invention relates to a device and method for measuring moisture in the manufacture of concrete, and parti¬ cularly it relates to an automatic system for measurement of moisture in the manufacture of concrete in a concrete factory.Concrete is in general manufactured according to carefully defined recipies and proportions of gravel, sand, cement, additives and water. The moldability of the concrete is of central importance for its quality and is strongly influenced by the so called vtc-number, i.e. the ratio between the amount of water and the amount of cement. It is therefore very impor¬ tant that one be able to continuously and accurately measure and control the moisture contents in the manufacture of con¬ crete.In the manufacture of concrete it is known to measure the moisture content in a gravel bin by measuring the resistance between two electrodes, placed on opposing sides in a gravel bin. ,A disadvantage with this system for measuring moisture is that coatings on or other damage to the electrodes gradually occur, such that the moisture measurement step by step becomes unreliable.Another known technique for determining the moisture content in a gravel bin is to place a radioactive probe in the bin and measure the number of hydrogen ions. The method gives good accuracy but the disadvantage is high costs and an environ¬ mentally hazardous technique. 

The invention is defined in the attached claims.An advantage with the present invention is that the moisture measurement in the manufacture of concrete can be carried out in an accurate and reliable way.Another advantage with the invention is that the moisture measurement can be carried out automatically during the course of manufacture of concrete.An additional advantage with the invention is that the moistu¬ re measurement becomes economically profitable compared with previously known systems.Still another advantage with the invention is that the risk for the occurance of coatings on and other damage to measure¬ ment electrodes is minimized.A further advantage with the invention is that the moisture measurement can be controlled by the same control system that controls the manufacture of the concrete.A still further advantage with the invention is that the influence of particle size in the gravel is taken into ac¬ count.The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the appended figures, whereinFig. 1 shows the principle of material flow in a concrete

CLAIMS
1. Moisture measurement device for a concrete manufac¬ turing system, said system comprising a gravel bin (1), an adjustable water source (4) and a plurality of other material sources (2, 3, 5), preferably for stone, cement and additives, and means (6, 7, 9) for feeding material from the various material sources to a concrete mixer (10), c h a r a c t e ¬ r i z e d by a control means (8, 30) arranged to selectively control the opening of a measurement shutter (53) in a measu¬ rement opening (52) in the gravel bin (1) for feeding a gravel sample (55) to a measurement container (41), to measure the resistance value of the gravel sample in the measurement bin, and to calculate the measurement content in the gravel sample, based on the measured resistance value.
2. Moisture measurement device according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d by two electrodes, one of which (45) is arranged on a displaσeable carriage (61), and the other (46) on the bottom (73) of the measurement bin (41), said bottom being openable.
