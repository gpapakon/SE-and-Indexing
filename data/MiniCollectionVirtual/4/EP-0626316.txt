<ABSTRACT>
An object of the invention is to provide an apparatus which is capable of easily and positively getting an 
article of food such as French bread and an article for daily use such as umbrell
as received into a receiving cover. 
To this end, the apparatus for getting an article received into a receiving cover according to the invention comprises a 

plurality of receiving covers adapted to receive a relatively elongated object, a body for containing a plurality of the 
receiving covers, and means for opening the opening portion of the receiving cover so as to have the object inserted 

into the receiving cover, said plurality of the receiving covers being loaded in the body of the apparatus while being 
received in a box. As a result, it is possible according to the invention to easily and positively get an article of food 

such as French bread and an article for daily use such as umbrellas received into a receiving cover.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a storage device
for bags for wrapping comparatively long and narrow items.When people buy foodstuffs and the like at a
grocery store, shop or department store, the customer
traditionally puts the items in a bag (for storing) in
order to carry them. Many such bags are comparatively
short. Therefore, items which are long and narrow in
shape, for example, French bread and the like, are
either not wrapped properly or are put in an unsuitable
bag.It is not, however, desirable from the point of
view of food hygiene, that food stuffs are carried
unwrapped and/or that food stuff's are carried together
with other, wrapped items. With regard to this need, an
automatic wrapping machine can be considered to wrap
food stuffs by means of wrapping bags. However, there
are some problems to solve.One of the problems is the complex structure of
such an automatic machine, resulting from the use of
suction as a means to open the wrapping bags, from the
number of links, or from the cam mechanism. In
addition, since a vacuum pump or a motor is used, the
production cost increases and such devices cannot be
used where a power source is not available close to the
device. Furthermore, power cords are a hindrance and
there is a danger of a short circuit, in that the
devices are usually operated when it is raining.It is known from JP-A-4-31229 to provide a storage
device for comparatively long and narrow items
comprising: a device body in which a plurality of
wrapping bags are stored, said wrapping bags having an
opening at the upper part thereof; and means for opening
the foremost one of said wrapping bags.The present invention is characterised by said
wrapping bags being removably stored in a box which is 
removably placed in the device body and said means for
opening comprising a pair of opening levers coupled to
an opening actuator so as to be inserted into said
opening of said foremost bag and rotated to open said
opening by downward movement of said opening actuator
when pressed by a user.In a preferred embodiment, the wrapping bags, which
are used in the storage device of the present invention
have the upper end of their front side folded and the
upper rear side extends above the front side. Locking
holes are provided at the upper end of the extended
portion.In its preferred embodiments, the present invention
is applicable to long and narrow items, for example,
food stuffs such as French bread and green onions, but
is not limited to these items, and is also applicable to
a variety of daily
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A storage device for comparatively long and narrow
items comprising:


a device body (1;101;201;401) in which a plurality
of wrapping bags (5;104;204;405) are stored, said

wrapping bags having an opening (5a;104a;204a;405a) at
the upper part thereof; and
means for opening the foremost one of said wrapping
bags;

characterised by said wrapping bags being removably
stored in a box (105) which is removably placed in the

device body and said means for opening comprising a pair
of opening levers (22) coupled to an opening actuator

(16;425) so as to be inserted into said opening of said
foremost bag and rotated to open said opening by

downward movement of said opening actuator when pressed
by a user.
A storage device as claimed in claim 1, wherein:

an upper end of a front side of the bag is folded;
an upper end (52a;142a;242a;452a) of a rear side of
the bag extends vertically beyond the front side; and
locking holes (5b;104b;204b;405b) are provided at
the upper edge of the extended portion.
