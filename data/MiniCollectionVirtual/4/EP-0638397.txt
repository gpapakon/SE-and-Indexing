<ABSTRACT>
A wrist device of a robot is provided 
for transmitting a rotational motion 

from a motor for driving a wrist casing 
through a gear device having a plurality of 

gears and disposed in the proximity of the 
wrist casing so as to rotate the wrist casing 

of the robot fitted to the distal end of a robot 
arm. A wrist driving motor (36) is disposed 

near the wrist casing, and the gear device 
includes a first gear (A) fitted to an output 

shaft for rotating the wrist casing (32), a 
second gear (B) engaging with the first gear 

(A) and receiving the driving force from the 
wrist casing driving motor (36), and gear 

base displacement means (12) for changing 
th
e axial distance between the first and 
second gears (A), (B) and rotating a rotary 

shaft (14) of the second gear (B) round an 
eccentric shaft (16) which is eccentric by a 

predetermined distance (a) from the rotary 
shaft (14) so as to adjust backlash between 

the first and second gears (A, B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an industrial robot 
and, in particular, to an improved wrist device for an 
industrial robot, in which the backlash between the 
gears for rotating the wrist of the robot can be 
adjusted. A robot wrist is mounted on the distal end of 
a robot arm for rotation about an axis. A driving force 
transmitting device for rotating the robot wrist is 
well known. However, the recent miniaturization of 
electrical motors allows a wrist casing driving motor 
to be provided adjacent to the the robot wrist and the 
rotational driving force is transmitted from the 
electrical motor to the robot wrist through a gear 
train having a plurality of gears. However, a driving force transmitting device 
including a gear train essentially has backlash between 
the pairs of gears. The backlash directly affects the 
positional accuracy of the robot wrist. Thus, in order 
to improve the positional accuracy of an end effector 
mounted on the end face of the robot wrist, it is 
necessary to minimaize the backlash in the robot wrist. It is, of course, possible to reduce the 
backlash by tight control of the machining accuracy of, 
and the distance between the axes of the gears during 
the manufacture and assembly of the robot. However, a 
very high level of finish is necessary to reduce 
backlash by tight control of the machining accuracy of 
the gears and the distance between the axes of the gears, 
which results in increasing the cost of manufacturing 
and assembling the robot. Furthermore, the gears wear  
 
when the robot is used for long time, and the backlash 
then increases. Thus, adjustment of the backlash is 
necessary after delivery to a user and installation in 
a factory, therefore only tight control of the machining 
accuracy of the gears is insufficient to permanemtly 
remove the backlash. A device for adjusting backlash is described 
in Japanese unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 
62-292389 in which gears for driving a robot wrist are 
arranged so that the center distance between the gears 
is adjustable. The disclosed device is so complex that 
the weight of the end portion of the robot arm is 
increased, and this results in an increased load on the 
motor for driving the robot arm and in reducing the 
positional accuracy of the robot arm. Moreover, the 
manufacturing cost of the robot is increased. Therefore, the object of the invention is to 
provide a robot wrist device which has a simple 
arrangement for adjusting backlash by changing the 
distance between the axes of the gears
