<ABSTRACT>
A pigment stabilized radiation image storage 
panel. The panel has a support and a luminescent layer 

overlaying the support. The luminescent layer includes 
phosphor crystals capable of absorbing X-radiation and 

emitting electromagnetic radiation of a second longer 
wavelength upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation 

of a third wavelength. The luminescent layer includes 
a dispersed oxosulfur reducing pigment. The oxosulfur 

reducing pigment is a reducing agent for iodine. The 

oxosulfur reducing pigment exhibits light scattering. 
The oxosulfur reducing pigment has a concentration 

sufficient to substantially increase the 
photostimulated luminescence of the panel. The 

luminescent layer has a total concentration of light 
scattering pigment insufficient to substantially 

increase the resolution of the panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to radiation image 
storage panels and more particularly relates to a 
pigment stabilized radiation image storage panel. Storage or stimulable phosphors are 
crystalline materials which have the capability of 
storing latent X-ray images for later release, 
apparently by locally trapping electron-hole pairs 
created by incident X-rays. Like many other 
crystalline materials, storage phosphors have a crystal 
matrix which allows for the replacement of some atoms 
by other similar atoms, but does not readily accept 
other atoms or moieties. Storage phosphors are 
distinguishable from the phosphors used in X-ray 
intensifying or conversion screens. In the latter, a 
latent image is not stored and X-radiation causes the 
immediate release of visible light from irradiated 
phosphor crystals. Radiation image storage panels are used in 
computed radiography. The panel is first exposed to X-radiation 
to create a latent image. The panel is then 
stimulated with longer wavelength radiation, resulting 
in the emission of radiation at a third wavelength. 
Typically a laser having a red or infrared beam is 
scanned over the panel, resulting in the emission of 
green or blue radiation. The emitted light is 
collected and the resulting signal is processed 
electronically to produce a final image. Degradation of image panel performance due to 
phosphor panel discoloration has long been recognized. 
Discoloration is a particularly serious concern for 
radiation image storage panels, since unlike 
intensifying screens, storage panels are subject to 
cumulative degradative losses of both emitted light and 
stimulating radiation.  There has not been agreement as to the source 
of phosphor panel discoloration. What was noticed 
early was that intensifying panels subject to prolonged 
exposure to photographic film have tended to become 
discolored. US-A-4,374,905 and US-A-4,360,571 state 
that the discoloration is due to "volatile organic 
constituents escaping from the associated photographic 
film" (US-A- 4,374,905, column 1, lines 40-59 and US-A-4,360,571, 
column 1, lines 46-64). Great Britain 
Patent Application No. GB 2 017 140 A states:
 
   "[I]t has been discovered that screens 
containing lanthanum[or gadolinium]-oxy-halide 
phosphors tend to discolor rapidly when in use and 
in particular when held in contact with an X-ray 
film, ...
 
   "In spite of intensive research into this 
discolouration defect the cause of it is not yet 
clearly known but it appears to be a complex 
reaction caused,
