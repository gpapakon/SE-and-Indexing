<ABSTRACT>
Easy-opening closure for the sheet metal lids (3) secured by seaming to a 
container like can (1) of the type including on the lid (3) a circular groove 

(5) of U-shaped section, with an outboard wall (10) and a bottom (12) on which 
a line of weakening (8) is placed; the said closure moreover includes a pull 

tab (9) connected to the lid by means of a rivet (7) positioned such that 
the point of the pull tab is overhanging the groove; the manual lifting and 

rotation of the tab cause the rotation of its tip towards the bottom to touch,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a closure for a lid or end 
cover made of thin sheet metal and secured as by a seam to a 
container body for cans and the like or for a bottom of a 
drawn metal container, of the type so-called two pieces. The aforesaid closure includes on the lid or on the bottom a 
circular groove and a circular line of weakening placed at the 
bottom of the groove and a ring-pull tab with point manufactured 
flat or with its point bended downwards while the remainder 
of it is sustantially constructively similar to the types 
used for the conventional easy-opening closures; the said tab 
is connected to the lid or bottom by means of a rivet normally 
formed from a protrusion obtained by drawing on the same lid 
or bottom then hammered on the tongue so as to have that the 
point faces the seam and overhangs the groove. The ring-tab may also be fixed without the rivet using on the 
contrary some glue or hot melt adhesive or varnish suitably 
applied; in this case the tab is removable and free positionned 
so it will be used as opening movable tool by levering in 
the groove. In the embodiment with the rivetted tab the opening is made 
with a finger by lifting the tab upwards so its point presses 
the fillet between bottom and internal wall near the line of 
weakening, a further tab rotation towards the outside makes 
possible to produce a leverage effect and to break the score  
 
line, so obtaining, by pulling off, the tearing of the metal 
portion included inside the line of weakening; the seam may be 
also used as a leverage fulcrum. The option in wich the tab has the point very bended downwards, 
the opening is obtained similarly to the conventional closures, 
this means that the tab touches almost immediately the metal 
near the score line. On the contrary in the solution with the tab connected by glue, 
it ts predisposed that the tab is removable and used like tool 
for levering one or more times inside the groove so breaking the 
line of weakening. The cans with ring tab are from time of large circulation, 
but all these conventional closures are charactherized by the 
fact that are realized only on lids and not on the bottom of 
drawn cans, but above all, and basic element of the present 
invention, for that known until today, there have been no indication 
of manufacture of cans characterized by the contemporaneous 
combined presence of an evident circular groove at the 
bottom of wich there is the line of weakening, as well as of a 
ring-tab overhanging the groove as well as
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A closure for a lid or end cover made of thin sheet metal 
secured by seaming to a container body like can,beeing of the 

type wich comprises formed on the lid a circular groove of substantially 
U-shaped section with an outboard wall located in 

the proximity of the seam,an inboard wall and a bottom on wich 
a line of weakening is provided, said closure characterized by 

the fact that it also includes a metal ring pull tab with relative 
point appendage, connected to the lid by means of a rivet, 

positioned such that the point of the ring-tab overhangs the 
groove and that the manual lifting and rotation of said tab 

cause as well the rotation of its point towards the bottom as 
far as the extremity of the point engages,by levering, the fillet 

placed between the bottom and the inboard wall that is to 
say near the line of weakening so causing the initial breakage 

of the said line and, by levering on the seam and further pulling 
up by means of the tab, the complete opening of the can. 
A closure according to claim 1 characterized in that the 
ring-tab, wich is substantially flat and horizzontally connected 

to the plane of the lid by means of a conventional rivet 
or by welding, is positioned such that its horizontal axis passes 

through the center of the lid and its point overhangs the 
groove in the direction of the external wall beginning from the 

top rim of the inside wall,said point leans out for a predetermined 
chosen portion of lenght equal to the height of the inside 

 
wall measured from the midpoint of the fillet between 

bottom and inside wall and the top rim of the inside wall so 
obtaining that at the opening the point of the tab,after the 

lifting and rotation of said tab as far as a substantially vertical 
position,engages a median point of the fillet between 

bottom and inside wall;the point of the tab can be partly bended 
downwards. 
A closure according to Claim 2 characterized in that the 
tab is substantially made of a semi-tubular rigid perimetric 

part wich finishes point-shaped and in the interior of wich 
there is a tongue wich begins in the point area but directed 

towards the center of the ring-tab and of the lid,said tongue 
is also provided with a hole for fixing the tab to the rivet and 

is easily folding beeing flat,it has lenght measured between 
the center of the fixing hole and the two fillets of circular 

arc shape wich join its sides with the remainder of the tab 
and wich forms pin and fulcrum point for the leverage in the 

opening, equal to the distance between the center of the rivet 
and an ideal line,parallel to the inboard wall,passing through 

the median point of the fillet between bottom and inboard wall 
of the groove. 
A closure according to Claim 1 characterized in that the 
outboard wall has an height in the range of 4 to 6.5mm measured 

between the top rim of the seam and the bottom of the groove 
and rake angle chosen between 2° and 16°. 
A closure according to Claim 4 characterized in that the 
inboard wall has an height in the range of 1 to 4mm,measured 

between the midpoint of the fillet between bottom and inside 
wall and the top rim of said inside wall in wich it joins the 

horizontal plane of the lid,said wall has also rake angle chosen 
limited between -5 and +15°. 
A closure according to Claim 5 characterized in that the 
bottom of the groove is substantially flat and has width chosen 

between 0.2 and 2.5 mm. and then it joins the outboard and 
the inboard walls by means of fillets circular arc shaped having 

limited radius value chosen respectively in the range of 0.4 
to 2.5mm and 0.25 to 0.6mm. 
A closure according to Claim 1 characterized in that on the 
bottom of the groove a line of weakening is provided, wich is 

embodied by a substantially V-shaped nick formed in the sheet 
metal lid starting from its external face,said line placed at 

a predetermined limited distance from the tangency point between 
the plane bottom and the fillet circular arc shaped joining 

bottom and inside wall chosen between 0.003 and 0.30 mm.
