<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an antipsoriatic pharmaceutical composition (useful for healing psoriasis), which comprises as active ingredient a complex active agent extract obtained by heating and subsequently pressing wheat grain and/or a grist thereof in admixture with carriers and/or additives commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. According to the invention, this composition is prepared in such a way that wheat grain and/or a grist thereof is (are) heated by using metal plates and subsequently, the thus-obtained complex active agent extract is transformed in a known way to a cream, emulsion, gel, tonic or solution by mixing it with carriers and/or additives commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTIPSORIATIC PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESSFOR PREPARING SAMEThis invention relates to novel antipsoriatic pharmaceutical compositions, particularly to novel pharmaceutical compositions useful for healing psoriasis. The invention furthermore relates to a process for preparing these compositions.Psoriasis is a worldwide occurring disease being particularly frequent in the moderate zone. Both men and women of various ages suffer from this disease. More than 1 % and in Europe 2 - 5 % of the entire population are psoriatic.Characteristics of psoriasis are: silvery squamae, desquamation of high grade and a well-circumscribed, round, usually lens-size skin tuber. This tuber occurs most frequently in the knee, elbow and scalp. At present it is recognized that psoriasis is hereditable, which is characteristic of families in some geographical areas. The most characteristic types of psoriasis are: gyrate psoriasis, palm-and-sole psoriasis as well as psoriasis of the scalp.The number of psoriatic people is continuously increasing. One of the most important reasons therefor lies in the phenomenon of the recessive type genetic transmission.According to the present scientific knowledges,75910-1815-SZO/KmO 

 psoriasis can only symptomatically be treated. This is achieved on the one part by diminishing the accelerated growth of epithelial cells and ceasing of the inflamma¬ tion. The use of cytostatics proved to be effective, how¬ ever, due to their toxicity, they can be used for treat¬ ment only twice or three times.It has been recognized in 1979 and published in 1982 that native terpenes isolated from the rhizome of DRYOPTERIS arrasi or from the leaves and rhizome of POLODIUM vulgare lium, POLIDIUM laucotomos, PLEBODIUM decumanum and CYATHEA tacivaniana are useful to treat psoriatic patients of any sex and age. Hundred fifty two patients were orally treated with daily 200 mg, which resulted in a symptom- ree state lasting 1 - 3 month(s) in 80 % of the treatments.Recently, the salt-water bathes can be considered to be an important supplementary treatment, chiefly due to the removal of squamae and relieving of the inflammations.It is obvious from those said above that the healing of psoriasis has not been solved up to the present and the drugs have several side effects.Thus, the present invention is aimed to develop a pharmaceutical composition being useful for healing psoriasis, by which the psoriasis can entirely be ceased without any adverse side effects and the original condition and colour of skin

 Claims
1. Antipsoriatic pharmaceutical composition (useful for healing psoriasis) which comprises as active ingredient a complex active agent extract, obtained by heating and pressing wheat grain and/or a grist thereof, in admixture with carriers and/or additives commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry.
2. A pharmaceutical composition as claimed in claim 1, which comprises the active agent in an amount of 0.05
- 99.0 % calculated for the total weight of the composi¬ tion.
3. A process for the preparation of an anti¬ psoriatic pharmaceutical composition as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, which comprises heating and then pressing wheat grain and/or a grist thereof and subsequently, formulating the thus-obtained complex active agent extract to a pharmaceutical composition useful for healing psoriasis, preferably to a cream, emulsion, gel, tonic or solution with carriers and/or additives commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry.
4. A process as claimed in claim 3, which comprises carrying out the heating and pression by using metal plates, suitably iron, copper or aluminium plates. 5. A process as claimed in claim 3 or 4, which comprises carrying out the heating of wheat grain and/or a grist thereof at a temperature range of 200 - 800 °C, suitably at 500 - 600 °C. 


 6. A process as claimed in any of the claims 3 to 5, which comprises using the active agent in an amount of 0.05 - 99.0 % calculated for the total weight of the composition.
