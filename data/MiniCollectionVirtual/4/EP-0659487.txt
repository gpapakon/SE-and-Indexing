<ABSTRACT>
A mobile dense-medium separating apparatus 
comprises a rotatable drum (12), arranged with 

its axis generally horizontal and having at one 
end an aperture (16) through which solids and 

liquid may be introduced into the drum and at 
the other end an aperture (17) through which solids 

and liquid may exit the drum, means (10, 11, 21) 
to convey solids and liquid to and away from said 

drum, means (18) to rotate said drum about its 
longitudinal axis and means (30, 31) to enable 

the apparatus to be readily moved between locations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
apparatus for dense-medium separation such 
as is used for separating a dense solid from 
a less dense solid. Dense-medium separation is used, for 
example, in the coal industry for separating 
high quality coal from relatively dense 
impurities or coal of lower quality. 
Separation is carried out by washing the 
solids mixture to be separated with a liquid 
medium of controlled density such as a 
suspension of magnetite of pre-determined 
concentration. The density of the liquid 
medium is chosen so that the lighter 
material of the mixture floats whilst the 
heavier component or components sinks. 
Either or both of the separated solids may 
be a desirable product of the process but, 
in the case of coal, where the density of 
the separating medium is typically between  
 
1.35 and 1.45, the lighter 'floats' are the 
desirable high quality coal whilst the 
'sinks' are low quality coal and impurities. It is of particular advantage to 
provide facilities for dense-medium 
separation which may be moved between 
locations relatively easily. For example, 
it may be required to treat imported coal at 
or near the quayside to avoid the additional 
costs of transporting it to a treatment 
plant and thence to its final destination. 
Mobile dense-medium separation equipment is 
already available but has certain 
disadvantages arising from the fact that 
such equipment hitherto available uses a 
rotatable inclined disc for contacting the 
solids mixture with the separation medium. 
Such disc or wheel separators cannot provide 
efficient separation except at low 
throughputs of solids because the pool of 
liquid medium which can be used is 
relatively small. Consequently either the 
throughput must be kept low or the quality 
of separation judged to be acceptable must 
be reduced.  The present invention aims to overcome 
some, at least, of the disadvantages of 
prior mobile dense-medium separation 
apparatus by providing an apparatus offering 
a greater contact between the liquid 
separating medium and the solids to be 
separated. According to the invention, a mobile 
dense-medium separating apparatus comprises 
a rotatable drum, arranged so that its axis 
is generally horizontal and having at one 
end an aperture through which solids and 
liquid may be introduced into the drum and 
at the other end an aperture through which 
solids and liquid may exit the drum, means 
to convey solids and liquid to and away from 
said drum, means to rotate said drum about 
its longitudinal axis
