<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to structural aggregate pigment products that are cationic, and have improved wet-end retention. A method for converting anionic pigments to cationic pigments is also provided. More particularly, a structural aggregate pigment comprising a clay and/or titanium dioxide or other particulate components, and a functional microgel made from silicon and aluminum or zinc gel formers and a gelling agent such as calcium chloride, can be cationized by adding an effective amount of modified or unmodified epichlorhydrin dimethylamine condensate to a slurry of the structured pigment. The resulting cationic pigments have superior papermaking characteristics and a much improved retention.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CATIONIC PIGMENTS This invention relates to structural aggregate pigment and filler products that are cationic, and have improved wet-end retention. A method for converting anionic pigments to cationic pigments is also provided.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPigments are finely divided particulate solids which for use are typically dispersed in vehicles or on a substrate, such as inks, paints, or polymeric materials. Pigments may be organic or inorganic, and are usually unaffected by the vehicle or medium in which they are incorporated. They may alter appearance by selective absorption or by scattering light, and are often used as an integral part of decorative, protective and functional coatings. Pigments may be colored, colorless, black or white. Some pigments are corrosion inhibitors, fungistats, and/or antistatic agents. In general, pigments are insoluble solids and remain insoluble when dispersed in a vehicle, as contrasted with dyes, which are soluble.Pigment particles may vary in size, shape and surface area. In commercial applications, typical particles are from 0.01 - 10.0 Î¼m in diameter and range from 1 - 1100 m2/g in surface area. To achieve complete dispersion of a pigment in a vehicle, the surfaces of the pigment particles must be properly wetted.Extender pigments are colorless or white pigments, generally with a refractive index less than 1.7. One example of an extender pigment is kaolin, a hydrous aluminosilicate mineral used as a filler in the paper and paperboard industry, and in paper coatings. As one 

example, pigmented paper may have a thin kaolin or other pigment coating. Calcined kaolins are white and hard, and are used for example in paper and in water based paints. Other extender pigments include clays, calcium carbonates, talc (magnesium silicates) , and titanium dioxide.Finely divided white mineral fillers may be added to improve optical and physical properties of paper sheets, primarily by filling the spaces between fibers. This produces a denser, softer, brighter and more opaque sheet, and may reduce cost because many fillers are less expensive than fibers. Clay is the most common filler, while talc is noted for its softness. Calcium carbonate is generally brighter than clay but can be used only in neutral or alkaline systems because of its solubility at lower pH levels. Titanium dioxide provides higher brightness and superior opacity, but is relatively expensive and inefficient. For example, as much as fifty percent of the titanium dioxide added to papermaking stock may be
