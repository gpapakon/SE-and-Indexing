<ABSTRACT>
A keyboard musical instrument lowers a key bed (1b) 
together with a keyboard (2), key action mechanisms (3) and 

hammer mechanisms (43) in a silent mode, and a stopper 
mechanism (3000) and a make-up mechanism (5000) cause the 

depressed keys to actuate the key action mechanisms (43) 
and damper mechanisms (40) as similar to an acoustic sound 

mode, thereby allowing a player to feel the key touch usual 
in a performance without an acoustic sound.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a keyboard musical
instrument and, more particularly, to a keyboard musical
instrument changeable between an acoustic sound mode to an
electronic sound mode through a movement of a key bed.A standard acoustic piano such as a grand piano and
an upright piano is equipped with a soft pedal for
lessening the volume of sounds produced through vibrations
of the sets of strings. The soft pedal and the associated
drive link mechanism of the grand piano laterally shifts
the key bed, and the hammers are offset from the normal
position for striking a smaller number of each set of
strings.Various new keyboard musical instruments have been
proposed. One of the new keyboard musical instrument is
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,250,065, and the new
keyboard musical instrument includes a grand piano, and a
pull-up mechanism is incorporated therein for lifting up
the hammer assemblies. While the pull-up mechanism lifts
up the hammer assemblies, the jacks miss the hammers, and 
the hammers are never driven for rotation. Sensors monitor
the key motions, and a tone controlling circuit produces
electronic sounds corresponding to the depressed keys
instead of the acoustic sounds.However, the pull-up mechanism spoils the key touch,
because the jacks do not escape from the hammer butts.The present inventors have proposed a solution. The
solution is to provide a stopper which causes the hammers
to rebound thereon before strikes at the strings, thereby
allowing a player to perform a music with either acoustic
or electronic sounds. The jacks escape from the hammer
butts regardless of the position of the stopper, and the
player theoretically feels the key touch as usual. The
proposed solution resulted in Japanese Patent Application
No. 4-215400, published on 10.02.94 under JP- 6035445.However, the key touch of an actual keyboard musical
instrument is different from the acoustic piano, because
the hammers rebounds on the stopper about 10 millimeters
before the strings. If the distance between the hammer
head and the strings at the rebound is shorter than the
distance, the hammer heads are liable to touch the
associated strings due to deformation of parts of the
hammers, and noise is mixed in the electronic sounds. 
Therefore, the distance between the hammer heads and the
strings is hardly shrunk, and the jacks are expected to
escape from the hammer butts or the hammer rollers before
the rebound.On the other hand, the distance of a standard
acoustic piano is regulated to 2 millimeters to 3
millimeters, and
