<ABSTRACT>
There are disclosed a controlling agent and an antifouling composition against 
harmful aquatic organisms, which include a particular N-phenylisothiazolone derivative of 

the formula: 

wherein X¹ and X² are the same or different and are independently hydrogen, chlorine or 
bromine; and R is haloalkoxy. Also disclosed is a method for preventing or inhibiting 

the adhesion of harmful aquatic organisms to water-exposed articles, which includes 
applying the antifouling composition to the water-exposed articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fouling control of harmful aquatic organisms
which adhere to various water-exposed articles. The term "water-exposed articles" is
used herein to cover marine vessels, buoys, littoral industrial plants, inlet channels for
cooling water in thermal or nuclear power stations, drilling rigs for submarine oil fields,
harbor facilities and sea pollution preventive bands for ocean civil engineering works, and
the like.As there can be found many kinds of animals and plants living in the sea,
various organisms may often adhere to water-exposed articles and have adverse effects
thereon. The adhesion of such harmful aquatic organisms will cause a decrease in the
service speed and an increase in the fuel consumption of marine vessels, and a decrease in
the carrying capacity of inlet channels of cooling water.To control these adhering organisms, various antifouling agents such as
cuprous oxide and some isothiazolone derivatives disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,127,687 have hitherto been known; however, their efficacy is not sufficient.Under these circumstances object of the present invention was to
find methods of more effectively preventing and inhibiting various organisms adhering to
water-exposed articles. As a solution it has been found that particular N-phenylisothiazolone
derivatives have an effect on the prevention and inhibition of adhesion of harmful aquatic
organisms, for example, harmful aquatic animals such as barnacles and sea mussels;
harmful aquatic plants such as algae and diatoms; and harmful aquatic objects such as
slime. Thus, the present invention provides a controlling agent and an antifouling
composition against harmful aquatic organisms, which comprise an N-phenylisothiazolone
derivative of the formula:

wherein X1 and X2 are the same or different and are independently hydrogen, chlorine or
bromine; and R is haloalkoxy.The present invention also provides a method for preventing and inhibiting
the adhesion of harmful aquatic organisms to water-exposed articles, which comprises
applying an effective amount of the antifouling composition of the present invention to the
water-exposed articles.The controlling agent and antifouling composition of the present invention
contain an N-phenylisothiazolone derivative of the formula ( I ), which is hereinafter
referred to as the compound (I), as an active ingredient.In the compound ( I ), the substituent R is haloalkoxy, usually C1-C8 haloalkoxy,
and preferably C1-C4 haloalkoxy. Typical examples ofthe haloalkoxy are
