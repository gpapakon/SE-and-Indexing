<ABSTRACT>
A flat lighting device designed to be free from 
accidental breakage of the leading-in wires for the luminous 

body comprised therein if they are subjected to vibration in 
use to consequently enhance the overall reliability of the 

flat lighting device. Such a flat lighting device (1) comprises 
a panel-shaped transparent substrate (2), a light source holding 

unit (3) fitted to an end face (2a) of the substrate (2) and a tubular 
luminous body (4) fitted to said light source holding unit (3) and is 

characterized in that said light source holding unit (3) is made 
of a conductive material and has a substantially U-shaped 

cross section such that it engages said end face (2a) at the open 
side thereof and that one of the leading-in wires (4a) of said 

luminous body (4) is connected to said light source holding unit (3) 
to form thereon a power feed section (3c) for the luminous body (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement made to a flat
lighting device to be used as a back light of a dotmatrix type liquid crystal
display panel to be suitable used for an apparatus for office automation (so-called
an OA apparatus) or a television receiving set.The US-A-5 253 089 discloses a transmission-type
liquid cristal display unit having an edge-type
backlight in which light from a fluorescent lamp is conducted
through a light-conducting plate. To increase the
light yield in direction of the light-conducting plate a
reflecting sheet is positioned in a way that it engages
the fluorescent lamp and an end portion of the light-conducting
plate.Fig. 3 of the accompanying drawings schematically illustrates
a conventional flat lighting device 90 of the type under consideration comprising
a panel-shaped transparent substrate 91 typically made of synthetic
resin, a light source holding section 92 formed of a silicon rubber or the like,
said lighting source holding section 92 being provided with a light 
source securing hole 92a and having a substantially U-shaped cross section,
and a reflective member 93 made of brass being coated with aluminium
by vacuum deposition.A reflector panel 94 and a diffuser panel 95 are then fitted to
the rear side and the front side of the flat lighting device 90 having a configuration
as described above and a tubular luminous body 96 such as a
cold-cathode fluorescent lamp is put into said light source securing hole
92a so that the flat lighting device 90 can illuminate the entire area of the
rear side of a liquid crystal display panel 80 arranged in front of the flat
lighting device 90 with a uniform distribution of brightness.In a conventional flat lighting device 90 as descirbed above,
the leading-in wires 96a, 96a of the luminous body 96 are normally arranged
at the respective opposite ends of the light source holding section 92
and, therefore, a very long feed wire 98 is required to connect one of the
leading-in wires and a power supply unit 97 of the flat lighting device 90 if
the later is arranged at a lateral side of the flat lighting device 90 that is remote
from the leading-in wire 96a. If the flat lighting device 90 is housed in
a piece of portable equipment which is moved frequently, then the leading-in
wire 96a that is vulnerable to vibration and connected to a long feed wire
98 can be easily damaged to force the equipment out of functioning.Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide a
flat lighting device that is free from the above
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A flat lighting device comprising a panel-shaped transparent substrate
(2), a light source holding unit (3) having a substantially U-shaped cross

section such that it engages an end face (2a) of the substrate (2) at the
open side thereof (3), a tubular luminous body (4) fitted to said light source

holding unit (3) characterised in that said light source holding unit (3)
is made of a conductive material and said luminous body (4) has two

leading-in wires (4a, 4b), one of said leading-in wires (4a) being connected
to an outer surface of one of the ends of said light source holding

unit (3), the other of the leading-in wires (4b) being provided to be connected
to a power supply unit (7), and a feed wire (6a) connected to an

outer surface of the other end of said light source holding unit (3) is provided
to be also connected to said power supply unit (7) to form on said

light source holding unit (3) a power feed section for said luminous body
(4).
A flat lighting device according to claim 1, characterised in that said power
feed section for said luminous body (4) is grounded.
