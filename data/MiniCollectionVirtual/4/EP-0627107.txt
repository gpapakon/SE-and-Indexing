 DOCUMENT HANDLERField of the InventionThe present invention concerns the field of document handling apparatus, more particularly for banknotes.Apparatuses of this type, for example banknote validators, also referred to as selectors throughout the following, are integrated into automatic machines selling goods or a service to users. They are generally applied at the moment to suitable processing of banknotes and also of other documents of value such as certain standard types of cheques. Throughout the following, the term document will designate a rectangular sheet of paper or other material of suitable dimensions, introduced by the user into the selector, this sheet being recognised as a genuine note or not after authentication tests.Description of the Background ArtKnown selectors may comprise an inlet aperture, widened out to a greater or lesser degree and protected from the weather to a greater or lesser degree, ending in a passage having a width greater than the width of the document and bounded by an upper 

face and a lower face. These two faces open into an inlet channel where the document is grasped by a transport means for the document, commonly termed a transport system, and consisting generally of a system of belts or rollers, cylinders, motor and pulleys. The setting in operation of the motor of this system is controlled by a control circuit or "processor" , which acquires the necessary data in particular through a system for detecting the document in the aperture; this system comprises for example sensors which detect the presence of paper. The tests for authentication of the document themselves may take place in a second part of the selector, situated after the inlet channel. If the document is not recognised as a genuine note, it is directed towards a rejection outlet, which may be different from the inlet aperture or otherwise, in order to return it to the user, who is assumed to have acted in good faith.If at the end of these tests the document is recognised as genuine, it is switched towards a box, intermediate or final, depending on the model of automatic machine. In the model with final box, any note recognised as genuine releases a transaction. In models with an intermediate box ("escrow"), the note is first stored in this intermediate box and its face value is credited. The transaction is released when 

the selling price is reached. If the user so wishes, he can cancel the request and his documents which have already been introduced are returned to him through the intermediate

CLAIMS :
1. A shutter arrangement for a document handling apparatus comprising a channel (26) , a shutter (5) capable of obstructing the channel (26, 11, 22) and pivotable about a pivot axis (18) into or out of the plane of the document (20) ; the shutter having other components (8) arranged to move therewith (e.g. for actuating the shutter) so as to define a moving assembly, characterised in that the mass of said moving assembly (5,8) is so distributed that the assembly does not exhibit any turning moment about said pivot axis (18) on vibration of the document handling apparatus to which the pivot access (18) is connected. 2. A shutter arrangement according to claim 1 in which the center of gravity of the arrangement is located on the pivot axis (18) .
3. A shutter arrangement according to claim 1 which comprises an elongate actuating member (8) extending away from said pivot axis (18) , said shutter (5) being connected to said member (8) so that actuation of said member (8) pivots said shutter (5) .
4. A shutter arrangement according to claim 1 further comprising a second pivot axis (33) , and actuating means (8b,9) for actuating said shutter (5) , 


said actuating means (8b, 9) pivoting about said second pivot axis (33), further comprising a counterweight arrangement (35) acting around said second axis to balance the mass of the assembly so that it exhibits no turning moment.
5. A shutter arrangement according to claim 1, in which said channel (26) is an inlet channel to said document handling apparatus.
6. A shutter arrangement according to claim 1 in which said channel (26) is an outlet channel leading to a document outlet of the document handling apparatus.
7. A shutter arrangement according to claim 1 in which the channel (26) branches into a plurality of outlet branches, and the shutter comprises a diverter (49) for selecting one of said outlet branches.
8. A shutter arrangement according to claim 1, comprising shutter drive means (19) actuated by a control circuit (21) acting in response to the action of one or more systems (3, 4) for detecting the presence of paper in order to close the shutter (5) by actuation of the drive means (19) .
9. A shutter arrangement according to claim 1, in which the shutter (5) obstructs the channel (26,11,22) over the whole of its width.
10. A shutter arrangement according to claim 1, 


in which the channel (26) is equipped with features engageable with cooperating features (17,60) provided in the shutter (5) to prevent the document (20) from passing round the shutter (5) . 11. A shutter arrangement according to claim 1, in which the shutter (5) has a shape resembling that of at least part of a cylinder of revolution about the axis (18) , and that at least one slot (11) is provided through the shutter (5) to permit the passage of the document (20) in at least one defined angular position of the device.
12. A shutter arrangement according to claim 11, in which the slot or slots (11) are symmetrical in relation to the axis (18) . 13. A shutter arrangement according to claim 11, in which there is only one slot (11) .
14. A shutter arrangement according to claim 11, in which that the or each slot (11) comprises a flared inlet portion allowing the document (20) to be guided into the said slot (11) .
15. A shutter arrangement according to claim 11, in which the shutter (5) comprises two slots approximately normal to each other.
16. A shutter arrangement according to claim 11, in which the shutter (5) comprises two slots, preferably generally parallel to each other, the 


pivot axis (18) being outside the plane of introduction of the document (20) into the aperture (16) .
17. A shutter arrangement according to claim 11, in which the shutter (5) is produced in several parts consisting of materials of different density distributed at different distances from the pivot axis (18) .
18. A shutter arrangement according to claim 1, further comprising means (10, 12, 14, 15) for identifying the position of the shutter (5) .
19. A shutter arrangement according to claim 18 in which the identification means comprise an encoder disc (10) connected to the shutter (5) to move therewith.
20. A shutter arrangement according to claim 19 in which the positions of the shutter (5) identified by the encoder disc (10) are at least four in number and uniformly spaced, two of the said positions corresponding to the complete opening of the shutter (5) and two others to its complete closure, and in which the processor (21) , in response to the action of the identification means (10, 12, 14, 15), may order the rotation of the shutter (5) . 21.
