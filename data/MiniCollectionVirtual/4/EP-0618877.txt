<DESCRIPTION>
 POCKET CONTAINER AND STAND FOR WRITING IMPLEMENTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This relates in general to containers for writing implements, and more particularly, to a pocket device constructed to serve as a receptacle, multiple cap, and table stand for supporting writing implements in a position accessible to the user. There have been numerous pen/pencil carrying and display cases in the prior art; but one combines a convenient carrying case with a device which is adapted to perform the multiple functions of providing a receptacle which serves to cap the enclosed writing implements, and which is adapted, when capped, to be carried in the pocket or purse, notebook or carrying case and otherwise, provides a support resting on a flat surface for holding the writing implements in a position accessible to the user and safe for children. A particular disadvantage of prior-type supports for writing implements is that they are designed to loosely engage the writing implements, wherein the inks or writing fluids tend to dry out.It is therefore the principal object of this invention to provide a device which is capable of performing all of the aforesaid functions.These and other objects are realized in accordance with the present invention which comprises, in preferred form, a rectangular pocket-sized caddy constructed to accommodate a plurality of writing implements in side-by-side parallel relation, the writing ends of which are snapped into sockets in the caddy which serves simultaneously to support and to securely cap each of the writing implements, eliminating loose caps which 

 children may choke on.The multicap caddy in accordance with the present invention comprises a hollow body of flexible plastic, which is integrally molded to include a plurality of aligned sockets into which the writing ends of the writing implements are each accommodated in a snap-fit.In one embodiment, the caddy is structured to accommodate conventional marking devices equipped with caps, and retain the caps of individual writing implements in the sockets upon removal of the marking devices from the caddy.A particular feature of this embodiment is that the inner profile of the caddy socket is so shaped that once the capped marking device is forceably interposed into the interior of the socket, the cap is secured in place, and is not readily removed, when the marking device is removed.In another embodiment, the caddy is formed with sockets which are designed to and function as multicaps for writing instruments.In accordance with

<CLAIMS>
I Claim:
1. A caddy including writing implements each having a barrel terminating in a writing end including a writing nib for feeding writing fluid from a reservoir in said barrel; said caddy comprising a hollow structure comprising a multicap having a body of flexible plastic material, said body having an upper surface and a lower supporting surface substantially parallel to said upper surface, a plurality of sockets extending in substantially parallel relation on said multicap from said upper surface in the direction of said lower surface, and shaped to retain in each of said sockets in captured relation a cap which is designed to snap-fit in sealed relation against the lower end of said barrel to retain each said writing nib in a substantially air-tight chamber when snap-fitted into said multicap.
2. A caddy in accordance with claim 1 for writing implements wherein each of said writing implements is initially equipped with a cap having a closed end and an open end with an annular edge which snap-fits onto the barrel of said implement for securing the writing nib in a substantially air-tight chamber when said cap is closed on said writing implement; means in each socket of said caddy for accommodating each said cap when a respective one of said writing implements is snap-fitted into said socket, and for capturing each said cap in said socket when said respective writing implement is removed from said socket.
3. A caddy in accordance with claim 2 herein said means for capturing each said cap comprises an inwardly directed cam-shaped flange adjacent the upper end of each said socket which is constructed and arranged to be overridden by the upper annular edge of a cap of a 


 respective one of said writing implements when the same is interposed in snap-fitted relation into said socket, and wherein said flange is constructed and arranged to engage and retain the upper edge of said cap when said respective writing implement is removed from said caddy.
4. A caddy in accordance with claim 3 wherein said cam-shaped flange has a cross-sectional shape in a plane normal to the principal axis of said socket which forms an angle of the order of 40 to 80 degrees with said axis in the exiting direction of said writing implement.
5. A caddy including writing implements each having a barrel terminating in a writing end including a writing nib for feeding writing fluid from a reservoir in said barrel; said caddy comprising a hollow structure comprising a multicap having a body of flexible plastic material, said body having an upper surface and a lower supporting surface substantially parallel to said upper surface, a plurality of sockets extending in substantially parallel relation on said multicap from said upper surface in the .direction of said lower surface, and shaped to retain in each of said sockets in captured relation a cap which is designed to snap-fit in sealed relation against the lower end of said barrel to retain each said writing nib in a substantially air-tight chamber when snap-fitted into said multicap; wherein said sockets are aligned and each of said sockets is interconnected in a lateral direction forming a lengthwise cut along the upper surface of said caddy; and, wherein said cut terminates on each of its lateral ends in a slit extending down from said upper surface, whereby the width of said cut relates flexibly to the diameter of writing implements inserted therein. 


 6. A caddy in accordance with claim 1 wherein said sockets are disposed in separate aligned relation terminating at each of their upper ends in a shallow annular collar having an inner diameter substantially equal to the inner diameter of said socket, each said shallow annular collar constructed to engage the body portion of a respective one of said writing instruments in substantially air-tight relation, thereby forming substantially air-tight multicap for a plurality of said writing instruments.
7. In combination with claim 1, a standard constructed and arranged to accommodate at least one caddy for a plurality of writing implements comprising a plurality of modules having elongated rectangular slots each of which is shaped to accommodate at least one said caddy in upright position; each of said modules equipped with a substantially identical hook-like projection across the front surface and a recess across the rear surface which is constructed to mate with said hook-like projection, wherein any desired number of said modules are constructed to be fastened together to form a standard for accommodating any desired number of caddies.
8. A caddy in accordance with claim 7 having a patch of a self-gripping material known by the trademark
VELCRO fastened to one of its large flat lateral surfaces, a carrying device or supporting surface for writing implements including at least one patch of a matching self-gripping material known by the trademark VELCRO, which is constructed to accommodate in mating relation at least one said caddy for carrying or supporting purposes.
