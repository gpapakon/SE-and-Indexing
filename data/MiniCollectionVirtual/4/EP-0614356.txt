<ABSTRACT>
The invention is represented by a transdermal medicated patch for the extended release of 17 beta -estradiol to the skin. The transdermal patch is formed by an outer covering, a matrix containing from 1 % to 5 % (w/w) 17 beta -estradiol, and a protective liner which is removed before use. The matrix is formed of pressure sensitive adhesive acrylic copolymers, in which the active ingredient is dissolved or dispersed. The acrylic copolymers are obtained by radical polymerization of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, methyl acrylate, acrylic acid, vinyl acetate, hydroxyethyl acrylate or a mixture thereof. Optionally quantities of less than 0.5 % (w/w) of other substances may be added.

<DESCRIPTION>
Ovarian secretion of 17β-estradiol is lacking in postmenopausal 
women. In many women this physiological phenomenon induces 
progressive hypotrophy of the urogenital system as well as 
characteristic vasomotor symptoms, often followed by 
osteoporosis affecting particularly the vertebral column. These climacteric symptoms can be prevented by an exogenous 
estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy. However, the oral 
administration of 17β-estradiol (hereinafter referred to as 
"estradiol") has problems, since the hormone is modified in the 
intestine and in the liver and produces high blood levels of its 
metabolites, such as estradiol sulfate, estrone and estrone 
sulfate which may accumulate in the organism, if the 
administration is prolonged. One of the undesired effects of the 
oral administration of estradiol is the increased synthesis by 
the liver of proteins, including the substrate of renin, with a 
possible consequent increase in arterial pressure. The oral route can be bypassed by the transdermal administration 
of estradiol, which delivers the active ingredient directly into 
the systemic circulation. However, the diffusion of estradiol  
 
through the skin is difficult. To improve it, a special 
transdermal systems must be developed that can enhance the 
absorption of estradiol, such as an especially designed, 
estradiol containing, pressure sensitive adhesive patch, i.e. an 
Estradiol Transdermal Patch (hereinafter referred to as "OTP"). The OTP represents a considerable therapeutic progress, over the 
conventional oral administration, since it avoids the "first 
pass effect" and delivers estradiol directly into the systemic 
circulation in quantities comparable to those which are 
physiologically produced by the ovaries. A widely used OTP is represented by a reservoir in which 
estradiol is dissolved in ethanol gelatinised with, for example, 
hydroxypropyl cellulose. The reservoir is contained by a 
membrane, through which estradiol diffuses to the skin. In this 
system the membrane becomes the diffusion-rate limiting 
component of the OTP, as it is the case of an OTP already on the 
market. Various patents have been applied for in connection with OTPs 
provided with diffusion-rate limiting membranes and the use of 
solvents such as ethanol, alone or in mixture, for dissolving or 
dispersing estradiol in the drug reservoir, and for improving 
its absorption through the skin. Thus, for example, GB patent 
2158 355 describes the use of a combination of propylene glycol 
and glycerol in

Claims
1. A transdermal medicated patch for the extended release of 170-estradiol to the skin, consisting of pressure- sensitive adhesive copolymers in which the active ingredient is dissolved or dispersed (matrix) , supported by a water-impermeable foil (outer covering) and covered by a protective liner that is removed at the time of use.
2. A transdermal medicated patch according to claim 1, characterized in that the pressure-sensitive adhesive copolymers are obtained by radical copolymerization of 2-βthylhexyl acrylate, methyl acrylate, acrylic acid, vinyl acetate, hydroxyethyl acrylate or mixtures thereof. If suitable, other substances may be added to the adhesive copolymers in quantities less than 0.5% (w/w) of the matrix.
3. A transdermal medicated patch according to claim 2, characterized in that the pressure-sensitive adhesive copolymers are obtained by radical copolymerization of (w/w of the matrix) about 50% to 70% (preferably 55% to 65% and especially 61% to 64%) 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, about 20% to 40% (preferably 24% to 32% and especially 25% to 28%) methyl acrylate, about 2% to 8% (preferably 3% to 5% and especially 4% to 5%) acrylic acid, about 2% to 10% (preferably 3% to 7% and especially 4% to 5%) vinyl acetate, and about 0.5% to 3* (preferably 0.7% to 1.5% and especially about 1%) hydroxyethyl acrylate.

' mixtur ;
