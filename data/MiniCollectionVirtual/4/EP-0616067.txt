<ABSTRACT>
The tentering-chain arrangement according to the invention is designed for a tentering machine for the heat treatment of broad-face fabric webs and contains two tentering chains, each with a multiplicity of chain links which are connected to one another by means of chain joints, each chain being supported and guided in chain-guide rails. With a view to a sufficiently high bending movability of the tentering chains approximately transversely to their direction of rotation and to a uniform fabric-web guidance, each tentering chain is composed of alternating rigid first chain links and multiply articulated second chain links, all the chain links having holding elements for the longitudinal edges of the fabric web.

Tensioning chain arrangement for a stenter for the heat 
treatment of lengths of material guided in open width in at 

least one treatment plane, comprising 

a) two tensioning chains (1), which run round continuously 
and are spaced from one another and which hold the 

lengths of material firmly on their long edges (10a), 
each having a plurality of chain links (5, 6) which are 

connected to one another, maintaining a constant chain 
pitch (T), by chain joints (7) which are constructed on 

their ends and have joint axes (8) extending 
transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction 

of the tensioning chain for pivotability of the chain 
links (5, 6), 
b) retaining elements (9) which are firmly attached to the 
chain links (5, 6) and jut out laterally in order to 

hold the longitudinal edges (10a) of the length of 
material, 
c) a plurality of rotatable chain return members (2), 
d) chain guide rails (3, 4) disposed in the region between 
the chain return members (2) for support and 

longitudinal guiding of each tensioning chain (1), 
 
characterised by the combination of the following features: 


e) a multi-joint second chain link (6) is disposed over the 
length of each tensioning chain (1) between each pair of 

adjacent rigid first chain links (5), the said second 
chain link (6) having in the region between the two 

chain joints (7) two additional joints (17, 18) with two 
joint axes (11, 12) extending at right angles to the  

 
first joint axes (8) of the chain joints (7); 
f) each second chain link (6) has on each of its two end 
portions an outer joint piece (13, 14) connected to the 

adjacent first chain link (5) as well as a middle piece 
(15) which is disposed between these two joint pieces 

and thus connected to the second joint axes (11, 12); 
g) not only all rigid first chain links (5) but also all 
multi-joint second chain links (6) each have a laterally 

projecting retaining element (9), the retaining elements 
of the second chain links (6) being in each case mounted 

only on the middle piece (15) thereof. 
Tensioning chain arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein each tensioning chain is composed of alternating inner 

chain links and outer chain links, characterised in that the 
rigid first chain links (5) form the outer chain links and are 

constructed in the form of chain links with side plates, 
whilst the second chain links (6) form the inner chain links. 
Tensioning chain arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised by the combination with the following further 

features: 

a) the chain joints (7), by which the ends which are 
adjacent to one another of the corresponding first chain 

links (5) and second chain links (6) are connected to 
one another, in each case comprise a bushing (19), a 

first pintle (8) forming the first joint axis as well as 
at least one needle bearing (21, 22); 
b) in each multi-joint second chain link (6) each end of 
the middle piece (15) is connected by an additional 

joint (17, 18) to one of the two outer joint pieces (13, 
14), these additional joints each comprising a second  

 
pintle (11, 12) forming the second joint axis and a 

plain bearing (23) filled with permanent lubricant. 
Tensioning chain arrangement as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterised in that in each chain joint (7) at least one 

needle bearing (21, 22) is in each case disposed both between 
the first pintle (8) and the bushing (19) and also between 

this bushing and a rotatable outer ring (20). 
Tensioning chain arrangement as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterised in that bronze plain bearings provided with 

permanent lubricant or plain bearings made from plastics 
material which is resistant to high temperatures are provided 

in the additional joints (17, 18). 
Tensioning chain arrangement as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterised in that not only the first pintles (8) on the 

chain joints (7) but also the second pintles (11, 12) in the 
additional joints (17, 18) of the second chain links (6) are 

fixed on the appertaining joint (7, 17, 18) by releasable snap 
closure elements (25, 26), preferably circlips produced from 

spring steel. 
Tensioning chain arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that not only the first chain links (5) but 

also the second chain links (6) have slide elements (27, 28 
or, respectively, 29, 30, 31) by means of which each 

tensioning chain (1) is supported on at least one slide rail 
guide (32 to 35) of the chain guide rails (3, 4) which at 

least takes up the cross-tensions of the length of material 
(10) and is substantially free of lubricant. 
Tensioning chain arrangement as claimed in Claim 7, 
characterised in that each slide rail guide (32 to 35) is 

constructed in the form of a carbon rail or plastic rail fixed 
on the appertaining chain guide rail (3, 4), the plastic rail  

 
being produced from plastics material which is particularly 

resistant to high temperatures. 
Tensioning chain arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that a restoring spring element (36) which 

spans the two additional joints (17, 18) is disposed on each 
outer long side of each second chain link (6). 
Tensioning chain arrangement as claimed in Claim 9, 
characterised in that each restoring spring element is

receiving holes (37, 38) onto two first pintles (8) which are
