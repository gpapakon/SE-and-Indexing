<ABSTRACT>
State of the art: A plurality of autonomous communications networks (KND, KNE) which are in each case managed by their own network management system (NMED, NMEE) are interconnected. Operators communicate by telephone. Technical problem: Network management tasks can be performed only unsatisfactorily with communications links via a plurality of these autonomous communications networks (KND, KNE). Underlying principle: The network management devices (MED, NMEE) exchange status information (CONFIG, STATISTIC, STATUS) with one another via a data network and make this available to the respective network operator (D, E). Solution: Each network management device (NMED, NMEE) requests from each other device selected information on the network components managed by the latter and with this represents graphically the status of the entire network. Advantages:     - Simple end-to-end fault management - Advantageous implementation of customer networks ('customer network management') - Network technology can be monitored centrally by a network management device.

Method for supporting the network management of a
communications network (KNA, KNB, KNC; KND, KNE) in a

communications environment in which several communications
networks (KNA, KNB, KNC; KND, KNE) are linked to one

another in such a way that an exchange of data is possible
between them, and in which each communications network

(KNA, KNB, KNC; KND, KNE) is respectively managed by means
of its own, autonomous network management facility

(NMEA, NMEB, NMEC; NMED, NMEE) in such a way that the
respective communications network (KNA, KNB, KNC; KND, KNE)

can be actively influenced only by the respective network
operator of the respective communications network

(KNA, KNB, KNC; KND, KNE) by means of its own, autonomous
network management facility (NMEA, NMEB, NMEC; NMED, NMEE),


characterized in that
 the autonomous network management
facilities (NMEA, NMEB, NMEC; NMED, NMEE) send to each

other, through a data network, data concerning the status
of the communications networks (KNA, KNB, KNC; KND, KNE)

managed by them, and such data, received from another
autonomous network management facility (NMEA, NMEB, NMEC;

NMED, NMEE), concerning the status of this other
communications network (KNA, KNB, KNC; KND, KNE) is made

available by means of an output facility (AUSE, IGUID), via
a graphical interface, to the respective network operator

(A, B, C; D, E) of the autonomous network management
facility (NMEA, NMEB, NMEC; NMED, NMEE) by the autonomous

network management facility (NMEA, NMEB, NMEC; NMED, NMEE)

Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the

formed by configuration data and/or status data of network
elements of the communications network. 
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

communications networks (KNA, KNB, KNC; KND, KNE).
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

recording file (RD1) for each network component (NK1
to NK8), each change in status of a network component

(NK1 to NK8) is recorded and, if a change in status of a
network component (NK1 to NK8) is detected, the network

management facilities assigned in the recording file (RD1)
of this network component are informed of the change in

status.
