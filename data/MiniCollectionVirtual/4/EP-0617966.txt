<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for inhibiting the 
γ-globin to β-globin switching in subjects 

afflicted with β-globin disorders. The method is 
effected as a result of the use of medicaments which 

ameliorate the clinical symptoms of sickle cell 
disease or β-thalassemia by introducing 
into the 
subject prior to natural completion of the switching 

process activin, inhibin, an inhibin chain or mixtures 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to 
inhibiting or reversing the switching in invivo or 
invitro from production of γ to β-globin, thus 
augmenting the production of fetal hemoglobin. In 
particular, the present invention is directed to 
the manufacture of medicaments for a method for 
controlling the fetal hemoglobin switch by introducing 
activin, inhibin or mixtures thereof to a mammal, or 
into erythroid cultures. Normal adult hemoglobin comprises a molecule with 
four polypeptide chains, two of which are designated 
a subunits and two of which are designated β 
subunits. Diseases known as sickle cell syndromes 
are associated with disorders in the β chain of the 
hemoglobin. However, in mammals, and particularly in 
humans, during fetal development, the fetus produces 
a fetal hemoglobin which comprises, instead of β-globin 
proteins, two γ-globin proteins. At some 
point during fetal development or infancy, depending 
on the particular species and individual, there is a 
so-called "globin switch" whereby the precursors of 
erythrocytes in the fetus switch from making 
predominantly γ-globin to making predominantly 
β-globin. It has been observed, however, that  
 
increased levels of fetal hemoglobin (derived from 
γ-globin) ameliorate the severity of sickling 
disorders. It has also been observed that subjects 
heterozygous for hereditary persistence of fetal 
hemoglobin syndromes (HPFH) and sickling hemoglobin 
(HbS) are clinically asymptomatic of sickle cell 
anemia. Also, infants with sickle cell anemia do not 
usually develop the symptoms of the disease until 
approximately four months of age when their fetal 
hemoglobin levels decrease. These observations 
suggest that a method for increasing the levels of 
fetal hemoglobin would be beneficial to patients with 
sickle cell syndromes. The present invention 
enables a method for inhibiting or reversing the γ to 
β-globin switch in a fetus or infant to maintain 
increased fetal hemoglobin levels in those 
individuals with sickle cell syndromes and β-thalassemias. Inhibin is a hormone which, among other effects, 
suppresses secretion of FSH (follicle-stimulating 
hormone) from the pituitary gland. Inhibin is a 
protein consisting of α and βA subunits linked by 
disulfide bonds. Activin, another hormone, sometimes 
also referred to as erythroid differentiation factor 
(EDF) or follicle-stimulating hormone releasing 
protein (FRP), is a homodimer consisting of either 
two βA subunits of inhibin (Activin A), two βB 
subunits of inhibin (Activin
