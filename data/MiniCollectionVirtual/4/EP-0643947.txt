<ABSTRACT>
Dental sand blast device comprising an abrasive medium container (1) which contains a compressed gas nozzle (8) near the floor for mixing of the abrasive medium with a conveying gas stream. The nozzle is directed into a conveying channel (9) with formation of an inlet opening (11) for the abrasive medium. A uniform stream of the mixture of abrasive medium and conveying gas is achieved in that the conveying channel (9) comprises a pressure release opening (13) in the abrasive medium container (1) at a distance from the inlet opening (11). An opening (15) for continued conveyance which is flush with the conveying channel (9) is provided behind the pressure release opening. The opening (15) for continued conveyance can have a smaller cross-section than the conveying channel (9) and may be arranged in an insert member (22) which can be exchanged for adjustment of this cross-section. The conveying channel (9) is arranged in a lance (19) extending in the longitudinal direction of the abrasive medium container (1) and designed for opening of the film lid (21) of a disposable abrasive medium container (4).

<CLAIMS>
A dental sandblasting apparatus with a blasting
medium container (1) which for mixing the blasting medium

with a conveying-gas flow in the vicinity of the base
includes a compressed-gas nozzle (8) which in combination

with an inlet opening (11) for the blasting medium is
directed into a free-standing conveyor duct (9) which at a

distance from the inlet opening (8) has an expansion opening
(13) open towards the blasting medium container (1) which

can be closed in a pressure-resistant manner, wherein a
transfer duct (17) is provided for directing the compressed

gas-blasting medium mixture out of the blasting medium
container (1), the transfer opening (15) of which is in

conveying communication with the expansion opening (13),
characterised in that in addition to the conveyor duct (9)

the transfer duct (17) is disposed in an upwardly closed
lance (19) and, adjacent the expansion opening, its transfer

opening (15) is in alignment with the conveyor duct (9).
A sandblasting apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the transfer opening (15) is of

smaller cross-section than the conveyor duct (9).
A sandblasting apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the edge of the transfer opening (15)

is in the form of a wedge or cutting edge.
A sandblasting apparatus according to any one of
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the transfer opening

(15) is disposed in a changeable insert part (22).
A sandblasting apparatus according to any one of
Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the expansion opening

(13) is situated above the maximum blasting medium level
(12). 
A sandblasting apparatus according to any one of
Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the transfer opening is

situated at a distance above the upper end of the conveyor
duct (9) which corresponds approximately to 0.5 to 4 times

the diameter of the conveyor duct (9).
A sandblasting assembly with a sandblasting
apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that in the blasting medium container (1)
of the sandblasting apparatus there is a disposable blasting

medium container (4), the lower end of which is closed by a
foil (21) pierced by the lance (19).
