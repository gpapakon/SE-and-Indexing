<ABSTRACT>
A nondirectional antenna assembly (100), and associated method, for a radio operative at high frequencies, such as at frequencies of approximately 1.8 Gigahertz. A first antenna portion, formed of a one-half wavelength, helical winding (124) is supported at a distal side of a nonconductive whip (106). A second antenna portion, comprised of a helical winding (130) supported at a proximal side of the nonconductive whip, and a one-quarter wave helical winding (136), connected to radio circuitry of the radio transceiver, couples the first antenna portion to the radio circuitry. Because the first antenna portion (124) is positioned at a distal side of the nonconductive whip (106), shadowing occurring as a result of positioning the radio transceiver proximate to a user during operation thereof is less likely to interfere with operation of the radio transceiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to antenna assemblies
and, more particularly, to an antenna assembly,
for a portable radio operable to transmit or receive, or both
transmit and receive, high-frequency, modulated signals.A communication system is comprised, at a minimum, of a
transmitter and a receiver interconnected by a transmission channel.
A communication signal is transmitted upon the transmission
channel, thereafter to be received by the receiver.A radio communication system is a communication system in
which the transmission channel comprises a radio frequency channel
wherein the radio frequency channel is defined by a range of
frequencies of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. A transmitter
operative in a radio communication system converts the
communication signal to be transmitted into a form suitable for
transmission thereof upon the radio frequency channel.Conversion of the communication signal into the form suitable
for the transmission thereof upon the radio frequency channel is
effectuated by a process referred to as modulation. In such a process,
the communication signal is impressed upon an electromagnetic
wave. The electromagnetic wave is commonly referred to as a "carrier
signal." The resultant signal, once modulated by the communication
signal, is referred to as a modulated carrier signal, or, more simply, a
modulated signal. The transmitter indudes circuitry operative to
perform such a modulation process.Because the modulated signal may be transmitted through free
space over large distances, radio communication systems are widely
utilized to effectuate communication between a transmitter and a
remotely-positioned receiver. The receiver of the radio communication system which receives
the modulated carrier signal contains circuitry analogous to, but
operative in a manner reverse with that of, the circuitry of the
transmitter and is operative to perform a process referred to as
demodulation.Numerous modulated carrier signals may be simultaneously
transmitted as long as the signals are transmitted along differing radio
frequency channels defined upon the electromagnetic frequency
spectrum. Regulatory bodies have divided portions of the
electromagnetic frequency spectrum into frequency bands and have
regulated transmission of the modulated signals upon various ones of
the frequency bands. The frequency bands are further divided into
channels, and such channels form the radio frequency channels of a
radio communication system. It is of course to be understood that
