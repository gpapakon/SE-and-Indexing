<ABSTRACT>
In the case of the method, a contact spring (23) which is operatively connected to an armature (3) is moved, when in a position corresponding to the operating position of the armature, into touching contact with its respective mating contact element. After this, a further movement is exerted on the armature in such a manner that the desired contact force is produced. A fastening end of the respective contact spring is fitted to a support (20) in a position corresponding to the further movement, and is connected to said support (20). As a result of the additional movement setting before fastening of the contact spring, this contact spring is already fixed in the correct position on its support so that tolerance accumulation is largely precluded and subsequent adjustment is avoided.

Method for setting the excess armature stroke in 
a relay having at least one contact spring (21, 22, 23, 

24; 107; 207) which can be actuated by an armature (3; 
105; 205) and is fastened by a fastening section (25, 26; 

108; 208) to a carrier (15b, 16b; 104; 212), in order to 
interact by means of a contact section with a mating 

contact element which is permanently anchored in a base 
body, characterized by the following steps: 


the contact spring (21, 22, 23, 24) which is 
operatively connected to the armature (3; 105; 205) 

is brought into contact with the mating contact 
element (11, 12, 13, 14; 110; 210) in a position 

corresponding to the operating position of the 
armature, 
the contact section of the contact spring (21, 22, 
23, 24; 109; 209) is brought into a position 

corresponding to a predetermined excess stroke, and 
then the fastening section (25, 26; 108; 208) of the 
contact spring is connected to the carrier in the 

position corresponding to the excess stroke. 
Method according to Claim 1, the contact spring 
(107) being coupled to the armature (105) in the region 

between its fastening section (108) and its contact 
section (109) and the contact section (109) touching the 

mating contact element (110) when the armature (105) 
bears on a core pole (106), characterized by the 

following steps: 

the fastening end (108) of the contact spring is 
moved on the carrier (104) counter to the armature  

 
pull-in direction, whereas the section of the spring 

(107) which is coupled to the armature (105) is 
restrained, with the result that the contact-making 

section (109) is pressed onto the mating contact 
element (110), and 
the fastening section (108) of the contact spring is 
connected to the carrier (104) when a predetermined 

excess stroke is reached. 
Method according to Claim 1, the armature (205) 
engaging via an actuating member (204) on an end (211), 

opposite the fastening section (208), of the contact 
spring (207) outside the contact section (209), characterized 

by the following steps: 

the contact spring (207) is arranged in a 
displaceable manner on its carrier (212) in such a 

way that it touches the actuating member (204) and 
the mating contact element (210), 
then the fastening section (208) is displaced on the 
carrier (212) parallel to the effective direction of 

the actuating member (204), the mating contact 
element (210) serving as a pivot point, and 
the fastening section (208) is connected to the 
carrier (212) after a predetermined excess stroke 

has been reached. 
Method according to Claim 1, a rocker armature 
(3), which can be pivoted about a centre axis, being 

connected to at least one contact spring (21, 22, 23, 24) 
which has in each case a contact section in the region of 

the two armature ends and a fastening section (25, 26) in 

the region of the centre axis, and a base (1), which is 
arranged underneath the contact spring, having a mating 

contact element (11, 12, 13, 14) underneath each of the 
contact sections and having a respective carrier (15b, 

16b) in the region of each fastening section (25, 26), 
characterized by the following steps: 


together with the armature, each contact spring (21, 
22, 23, 24) is pressed with the two opposite contact 

sections onto the associated mating contact elements  
 

(11, 12, 13, 14), until a desired excess stroke is 
reached, 
afterwards the armature (3) is lifted with the 
contact springs (21, 22, 23, 24) by a distance which 

corresponds to approximately half the stroke of each 
armature end - taking account of the excess stroke 

- and 
then each fastening section (25, 26) is connected to 
the associated carrier (15b, 16b) of the base (1). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that, after the excess stroke position 

has been reached, the current passage is tested in each 
case at all the closed contacts. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the carrier (15b, 16b; 104; 212) 

serves in each case as a power supply means for the 
contact spring (21, 22, 23, 24; 107; 207), and in that 

the contact spring is fastened to the carrier by 
soldering or welding.
