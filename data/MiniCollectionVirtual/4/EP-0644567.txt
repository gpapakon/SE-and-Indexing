<ABSTRACT>
Rotating-arc circuit breaker (1) including a fixed contact (2), a moving contact (3), a leaktight casing (4) forming a cutoff chamber (5) which surrounds the fixed and moving contacts and a device (6) for making the arc rotate around the said fixed contact. According to the invention, the circuit breaker further includes a cooling means (14) which is arranged in the cutoff chamber and which consists of a plurality of flat rings (15) arranged parallel to each other and spaced from one another in such a way as to form a plurality of annular spaces (18) between them.

A rotating arc switch insulated by an insulating gas of high dielectric strength, and
comprising:


a stationary contact (2), and a movable contact (3),
a sealed enclosure (4) filled with said gas and forming an arc extinguishing
chamber (5) surrounding the stationary and movable contacts,
a device (6) with a coil (7) to make the arc rotate around said stationary contact,
and a cooling means (14) arranged in the arc extinguishing chamber and
comprising a plurality of flat rings (15) or plates disposed appreciably parallel to

one another and separated from one another in such a way as to form a
succession of annular spaces (18) between them,

characterized in that fixing means secure the cooling means (14) to a rigid part of the
switch, that each of said rings (15) is presented in the general form of an appreciably

flat thin plate in the form of a disk provided with a central hole whose diameter is
greater than the largest external diameter of the movable contact (3), that the rings

are arranged in such a way as to surround the movable contact being appreciably
centred on the longitudinal central axis (9) of said switch, and that the maximum

distance (C) separating the stationary and movable contacts is equal to or smaller
than the sum of the minimum distance (D1) between said cooling means and the

stationary contact and the minimum distance (D2) between said cooling means and
the fully open movable contact.
The rotating arc switch according to claim 1, characterized in that the cooling
means (14) is fixed to the front part (30) of the coil (7).
The rotating arc switch according to one of the claims 1 or 2, characterized in that
said rings (15) are made from appreciably flat metal plates.
The rotating arc switch according to claim 3, characterized in that the plates (15) of
the cooling means are electrically insulated from the coil (7) by insulating means

comprising an insulating sleeve (40) through which a fixing bolt (32) passes.
The rotating arc switch according to claim 1, characterized in that said rings (15)
are made from appreciably flat insulating plates. 
The rotating arc switch according to claim 1, characterized in that said rings (15)
are made from plates made of a porous material.
The rotating arc switch according to claim 1, characterized in that said rings (15)
are made from appreciably flat plates comprising undulations.
The rotating arc switch according to claim 1, characterized in that there is provided
around said rings an external cylindrical part (20) situated at a certain distance from

the external edges (16) of the rings.
The rotating arc switch according to claim 3, characterized in that said metallic
rings (15) comprise at least one radial slot (30).
