<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a control valve (10) for product, having a housing (12) with first and second chambers (14, 16) arranged therein, the first chamber (14) having a connection (15) for a pressure medium and the second chamber (16) having an entry opening (20) and an outlet (24) for pressure fluid to be fed, the first and second chambers (14, 16) being separated from each other by means of a diaphragm (18) which is provided with an intermediate piece (38) which acts, via a plunger (36), on a throttle valve (22) in the entry opening (20), the throttle valve (22) being designed in two stages and having, in a first stage in the entry direction, a sphere (26) as blocking element and, in a second stage, a sealing cone (32) as blocking element.

Control valve (10) for a product, having a
housing (12) with first and second chambers (14, 16)

arranged therein, which first chamber (14) has a connection
(15) for a pressure medium, and which second chamber

(16) has an inlet opening (20) and an outlet (24) for
pressure fluid to be fed in, which first and second

chambers (14, 16) are separated from one another by means
of a diaphragm (18) which is provided with an

intermediate piece (38) which acts, by means of a ram
(36), on a throttle valve (22) in the inlet opening (20),

characterized in that the throttle valve (22) is of two-stage
configuration and has a ball (26) as a blocking

element in a first stage in the inlet direction and a
sealing cone (32) as a blocking element in a second

stage.
Control valve for a product according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the ball (26) is arranged in a

first valve space (28) and, in the blocking position, is
placed against a first sealing seat (27) from which the

ball (26) can be raised by the ram (36) via the sealing
cone (32).
Control valve for a product according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the first valve space (28) has a

stop (29) which holds the ball (26) captive in the first
valve space (28).
Control valve for a product according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the stop (29) is configured as a

further sealing seat and, together with the ball (26),
serves as a return-flow barrier for fluid flowing

through.
Control valve for a product according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the sealing

cone (32) is moulded onto the free end of the ram (36),
which is acted upon by the intermediate piece (38), and,

in the blocking position, rests against a second sealing
seat (32) which is arranged in the inlet opening (20).
Control valve for a product according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the sealing cone (32) is connected

to a screw head (34) of a slotted screw which forms the
ram (36) and engages in the intermediate piece (38).
Control valve for a product according to Claim 5
or 6, characterized in that the shank (40) of the ram

(36) tapers conically, at least in some areas, from the
sealing cone (32) in the axial direction towards the

intermediate piece.
Control valve for a product according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the inlet

opening (20), through which the conically tapered ram
shank (40) extends and which opens into the second

chamber, is of cylindrical configuration.
Control valve for a product according to one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the diaphragm

(18) is assigned an annular space (19) to collect
leakages.
