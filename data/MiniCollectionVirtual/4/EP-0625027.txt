<ABSTRACT>
An iris dilator includes a body (100) formed of an expansible material being expandable from a dehydrated first size and shape to hydrated second size and shape. When hydrated, the dilator has a shape complementary to an inside diameter of the iris and a size sufficient to dilate the iris. In the presence of bodily or surgical fluids, the dilator hydrates and expands to engage and dilate the iris. An apparatus (120) for deforming the dilator to facilitate insertion in use includes top (126) and bottom (128) surfaces which engage top and bottom sides of the dilator, respectively, at least one depression member (122) for forming a depressed area on an edge of the dilator and at least one retainer member (124) for retaining a non-depressed area on the edge of the dilator (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
 "Iris Dilator, Deformer and Procedure"Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to an intraoperative iris dilator apparatus for use in mammals and to a method for forming and inserting the dilator into the mammalian eye.Background of the InventionSurgical procedures invariably involve a certain amount of trauma to tissues and organs at and around the surgical site. Minimizing surgical trauma is an important goal because it helps to minimize the risk of complications and helps reduce the postsurgical healing period. Trauma is of particular concern in surgical procedures involving the eye because of the delicate nature of that organ and its constituent parts.Several surgical procedures in the eye involve entering the eye through a small incision through the cornea or front of the eye and proceeding past the plane of the iris and through the pupil. Cataract removal and implantation of a replacement lens, such as an intraocular lens, is one example of such a procedure.To avoid injury to the iris, a critical but weak and delicate organ controlling the amount of light 

entering the eye, in procedures passing through or near the iris, it is desirable to dilate the pupil to keep the iris out of harm's way and to give the surgeon a wider opening through which to work and view the posterior segments of the eye. During an eye surgery procedure, the eye surgeon may dilate the iris chemically using a mydriatic. However, this dilation method is limited in time and offers no protection to the iris against the invasive procedures. Mechanical dilators or retractors have also been developed. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,387,706 discloses an iris retractor comprising a substantially circular, resilient ring which is compressed or deformed while inserting through an incision in the cornea, where it is then worked into an abutting relationship with the iris, where compression forces are released to allow the retractor to return to its normal (expanded) shape, forcing the iris open. U.S. Patent No. 4,782,820 discloses an adjustable iris retractor which preferably has a pair of separable, slideably interengaged ends which allows sliding movement to increase or decrease the diameter of the retractor. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,490,455; 4,037,589; 4,257,406; and 4,991,567 disclose various conventional clamps, tacks and mechanical devices typical of other conventional retractors used in a variety of surgical procedures. Such conventional mechanical dilators and retractors are expensive to manufacture, cumbersome to use,

CLAIMS 1. An iris dilator comprising a body formed of an expansile material, said material being expandable from a dehydrated first size and shape to a hydrated second size and shape when in the presence of bodily or surgical fluids, said hydrated dilator having a shape substantially complementary to an inside perimeter of a mammalian iris and having a size sufficient to dilate the iris when placed in substantial engagement with the iris. 2. The iris dilator according to claim 1, wherein the material comprises hydroxyethylmethacrylate.
3. The iris dilator according to claim 1, wherein the dehydrated iris dilator body is substantially circular. 4. The iris dilator according to claim 3, wherein the iris dilator is provided with a centrally located aperture extending therethrough.
5. The iris dilator according to claim 1, wherein the iris dilator body is substantially ring- shaped.
6. The iris dilator according to claim 5, wherein the hydrated dilator has an inner diameter of at least about 7 mm.
7. The iris dilator according to claim 1, wherein the iris dilator body has a radially outwardly extending retaining groove along the perimeter thereof, said groove having side walls for at least partially enveloping anterior and posterior surfaces of the iris.
8. The iris dilator according to claim 7, wherein the side walls are scalloped-shaped.
9. An iris dilator comprising a body formed of an expansile material being expandable from a dehydrated first size and shape to a hydrated second size 


and shape when in the presence of bodily or surgical fluids, said hydrated dilator having a size sufficient to dilate a mammalian iris when placed in substantial engagement therewith, said hydrated dilator having a shape complementary to an inside perimeter of the iris.
10. The iris dilator according to claim 9, wherein said dehydrated dilator has a shape defining an insertion width allowing said dilator to be passed through a surgical incision of a predetermined size in a patient. 11. The iris dilator according to claim 10, wherein the insertion width is no larger than about 3 mm.
12. The iris dilator according to claim 10, wherein the dehydrated iris dilator has a bilobal shape.
13. The iris dilator according to claim 10, wherein the dehydrated iris dilator has a trilobal shape.
14. A method for dilating an iris of a mammalian patient using an iris dilator comprising a body formed of an expansile material being expandable from a dehydrated first size and shape to a hydrated second size and shape when in the presence of bodily or surgical fluids, said hydrated dilator having a size sufficient to dilate a mammalian iris when placed in substantial engagement therewith, said hydrated dilator having a shape complementary to an inside perimeter of the iris, the method comprising the steps of:
(a) inserting the dehydrated iris dilator into a position radially inwardly from the iris; and
(b) hydrating the iris dilator until it expands to engage and dilate the iris.
15. An apparatus for deforming to a dehydrated first size and shape from a hydrated second size and shape an iris dilator comprising a body formed of 


an expansile material being expandable from the first size and shape to the second size and shape when in the presence of bodily or surgical fluids, said body having top and bottom sides and a peripheral edge, the apparatus comprising a top surface for engaging the top side of the dilator and a bottom surface for engaging the bottom side of the dilator, at least one slidingly movable depression member for engaging and forming a depressed area of the edge of the dilator and at least one slidingly movable retainer member for engaging and retaining a non-depressed area of the edge of the dilator.
