<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle tracking system for determining the position of a vehicle, 
which includes a dead reckoning (DR) mechanism including a heading 

sensor and a distance sensor and a Global Positioning System (GPS) 
mechanisms. The system further includes an adjustment mechanism 

connected to the DR mechanism and to the GPS means, with the 
adjustment being operative in using the GPS mechanism to improve the 

accuracy of the position calculated by the DR mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to vehicle tracking systems and, more 
particularly, to vehicle tracking systems which utilize Global Positioning 
System ("GPS") to track the location of vehicles. A variety of systems are currently in use which have as their 
objective the tracking of the location of a vehicle, such as a land, sea or air 
vehicle. These systems are based on one or both of two fundamental 
techniques. The first technique, known as Dead Reckoning ("DR") relies 
on the cumulated internal measurements of distance travelled and bearing 
to calculate the location of the vehicle. In the second technique, Global 
Positioning System ("GPS"), a GPS receiver is used to receive signals from 
a GPS satellite and directly compute vehicle location. GPS navigation suffers from at least two major limitations. The first 
involves the obscuring of signals, which commonly occurs in urban area 
and in heavily wooded regions and which temporarily blinds the GPS as 
the vehicle passes through certain portions of cities, tunnels, heavily 
forested areas, and the like. The second limitation is a consequence of the 
legal constraints placed on the non-authorized use of GPS. To prevent 
non-authorized parties from gaining access to the full power of GPS, the 
United States Department of Defense has enacted regulations which limit 
the maximum accuracy of GPS units intended for civilian use. The civilian  
 
user of GPS is thus subjected to selective availability ("SA") errors which 
significantly decrease the accuracy of the system. Dead Reckoning tracking also suffers from a number of limitations, 
chief among which is the accumulation of distance and bearing errors 
which is an inherent limitation of DR systems. Various attempts have been made to enhance the capabilities of 
GPS and of DR, either separately or, preferably, together. Among the 
systems which combine GPS and DR is the Placer GPS/DR product 
marketed by Trimble Navigation. The Placer GPS/DR automatically 
switches to DR whenever GPS satellite signals are blocked by tall 
buildings or terrain features such as tunnels and multi-deck bridges. Thus, 
at any given time, either the GPS or DR systems is operative and 
controlling. The Placer GPS/DR claims an accuracy under DR conditions 
of 3-5% of distance traveled up to 10 km, which accuracy is conditional 
upon the accuracy of the pulse odometer and on non-SA GPS conditions 
prior to DR calculation. While such accuracy is a marked improvement 
over a stand-alone GPS system which would offer no data
