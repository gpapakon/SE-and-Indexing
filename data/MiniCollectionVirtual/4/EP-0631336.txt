<ABSTRACT>
To improve reversibility of LiCoO₂ used as a positive pole active material in a lithium secondary cell, use is made of 
LiCoO₂ which has a peak intensity of X-ray diffraction line on a (101) plane within the range of 5 to 15 when the peak intensity 

of the X-ray diffraction line on a (003) plane is 100.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lithium secondary battery, 
especially to its positive active material. In resent years, studies have been carries actively on 
a lithium secondary battery and those having a working voltage 
of about 3V are now partially put in practical use. However, 
it can not be said that these lithium secondary batteries are 
provided with satisfactory characteristics with respect to 
energy density and service life. Recently, batteries which utilize a positive active 
material having a working voltage of about 4V in order to 
increase the energy density and which utilize an organic burnt 
material as a negative electrode in order to prolong the 
service life, are reported and attract public attention. The inventors begun investigations into 4V-group positive 
active materials having a working voltage of about 4V on the 
basis of consideration that, even when the service life was 
prolonged by utilizing the organic burnt material as the 
negative electrode, a battery having a high energy density 
could not be obtained if the working voltage of positive 
electrode was not high. As the result, we came into 
conclusion that LiCoO₂ shown by Mizushima et al., "Material 
Research Bulletin" vol. 15, pp. 783, 1980, was the favorable 
4V-group positive active material in the present stage.  However, the following problems have become clear from 
energetic studies on the LiCoO₂. Although the LiCoO₂ had a 
high working voltage of about 4V and a high energy density, 
the reversibility of LiCoO₂ was poor when it was subjected to 
deep charging and discharging. In other words, it was 
difficult to put the LiCoO₂ into practical use as the positive 
active material of lithium secondary battery if the problem 
of poor reversibility in the LiCoO₂ was not improved. An object of this invention is to improve the poor 
reversibility of LiCoO₂ and to provide a lithium secondary 
battery having a large discharge capacity. In a lithium secondary battery utilizing LiCoO₂ as its 
positive active material, this invention is characterized by 
that a peak strength of X-ray diffraction in (101) plane of 
LiCoO₂ lies within a range of 5 to 15 when a peak strength of 
X-ray diffraction in (003) plane is 100. When the LiCoO₂ is subjected to deep charging, a part of 
crystal structure changes to a discontinuous one. It can be 
considered that this change in crystal structure is a cause 
of the poor reversibility. It became clear from studies on 
the crystal structure that LiCoO₂ prepared by an ordinary 
method, i.e.
