<DESCRIPTION>
 VEHICLE CRASH PROTECTION DEVICEThis invention relates to a vehicle crash protection device suitable, for example, for placement alongside roads, between opposing driving lanes, in front of hazardous spots such as highway exit ramps, bridge abutments and guard-rails, around motor racing courses and at dangerous spots during rally competitions.The vehicle crash protection device is intended to provide good protection both for vehicle drivers and passengers as well as for people located behind said device in the event of a lighter vehicle, such as a car, crashing into it.A common predominant crash barrier device used in front of fixed obstructions, such as highway exit ramps, bridge abutments and support columns, is a container filled with sand or a container filled with sand and leca-balls. Such crash protection devices according to previous technology are, for example, described in U.S. Patent No. 3,606,258, 4,073,482, the British Patent No. 2,060,036 and the Swedish Patent 444 829.The drawbacks with containers filled with sand as described in the three first mentioned references are related to the fact that sand is a rigid material which does not provide a sufficiently soft impact absorber. The crash protection modules filled with leca-balls have the disadvantage that leca-balls also comprise a somewhat rigid material and this is destroyed in a collision. Furthermore, such crash modules filled with leca-balls have proven to be too expensive to compete with the sandfilled containers. 

Around motor racing tracks, hay-bales and rubber tires, for example, are used as crash barrier modules. Hay-bales are too light to stop a vehicle effectively, while tires stapled on top of each other have too little weight and too high elasticity to ensure good protection. These characteristics constitute clear disadvantages when the purpose of the crash protection device is to protect people behind the crash barrier modules.One frequently occurring problem with prior crash protection devices is that the colliding vehicle has a tendency to "climb up" onto the device. As a result of this ramp effect the vehicle can overturn.The crash protection module according to this invention consists of a cover, e.g. in the form of a bag, which contains a shock absorbing granulated material of rubber, elastic plastic material or mixtures thereof.The cover of the crash protection device is made of a tough, wear and weather resistant elastic material. A suitable material is, for example, a fabric of polypropylene. The shape of the cover

 CLAIMS
1. A crash protection device characterized in that it comprises a cover surrounding a shock absorbing granulated material of plastic and/or rubber.
2. A crash protection device according to claim 1 characterized in that the shock absorbing material consists of granulated plastic and/or rubber material recycled from car and cable scrap.
3. A crash protection device according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the shock absorbing material has a particle size of 1 to 30 mm and a hardness of 40-95 Shore A.
4. A crash protection device according to any of the foregoing claims, characterized in that the bulk density of shock absorbing material lies in the range of 0.3 - 0.7 tonne/ cubic metre.
5. A crash protection device according to any of the foreÂ¬ going claims, characterized in that the plastic in the shock absorbing granulated material is selected among plasticized PVC, polyethylene, crosslinked polyethylene and polyurethanes and mixtures of these plastics.
6. A crash protection device according to any of the foregoing claims, characterized in that it is in the form of a bag having a volume of from 0.6 to 3 cubic metre containing the shock absorbing material.
)
7. A crash protection device according to any of the J foregoing claims characterized in that said crash protection device is in the form of one or more bags provided with interconnecting means in the form of bands whereby several 



bags may be connected to one another or to fixtures in the ground to constitute a protection barrier.
8. A crash protection device according to any of the foregoing claims, characterized in that the cover surrounding the shock absorbing material in its turn is surrounded by further cover on which connection means in the form of bands are fastened and this outer cover is put on top of the inner cover to reinforce the construction of the device and prevent leakage of shock absorbing material at a vehicle crash.
9. A crash protection device according to any of the foregoing claims, characterized in that the cover material consists of polypropylene.
10. A crash protection device according to any of the foregoing claims characterized in that the bottom part of the bag is filled with a heavy material having a bulk density not ess than 1.5 tonne/cubic metre.
