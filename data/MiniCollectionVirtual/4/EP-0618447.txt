Process for automatically testing and determining the quality of tablets or pills which
are continuously being discharged from a tablet or pill pressing machine and which

are conveyed into a plurality of containers (5, 6), whereby, in order to carry out
automatic quality control, tablet or pill samples are taken from the tablet or pill

stream (sampling) and are then tested in a tablet or pill testing device (15) according
to prescribed quality features,

characterized in that

a) the containers (5, 6) are each positioned on a set of scales (2, 3), and the weight
of the container currently being filled, including its content of tablets or pills, is continuously

measured, converted into a corresponding electric signal, and continuously
transmitted to a computer and control unit located in the tablet or pill testing device

(15),
b) for each container (5, 6), identification is carried out, which is likewise transmitted
to the computer and control unit,
c) at prescribed intervals, tablet or pill test samples are taken from the tablet or pill
stream which is flowing into the container (5, 6) currently being filled and are conveyed

to the tablet or pill testing device (15) where they are then tested according to
prescribed quality features,
d) the test results are associated with the container (5, 6) currently being filled and
stored by the computer and control unit, and optionally printed visually on a printout

that serves as a record for the corresponding container.
Process according to Claim 1,

characterized in that

the prescribed intervals for taking the samples are weight-controlled in increments as
a function of the increasing weight of the container (5, 6) during the filling operation,

for example, in n-kg increments, so that one sample is taken every time the weight of
the container increases by n kg.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that

the taking of the samples is time-controlled, for example, in n-minute increments, so
that one sample is taken every n minutes.
Process according to one of the preceding Claims,

characterized in that,

at the end of the filling procedure, the records of all of the samples taken for a given
container are compiled and printed out.
Process according to one of the preceding Claims,

characterized in that

the computer and control unit of the tablet and pill testing device (15) continuously
requests the current weight of the containers (5, 6), a container number for the identification

and a container change as well as the samples taken. 
Device for automatically testing and determining the quality of tablets or pills which
are continuously being discharged from a tablet or pill pressing machine and for

conveying them into a plurality of containers (5, 6), whereby, in order to carry out
automatic quality control, tablet or pill samples can be taken from the tablet or pill

stream (sampling) and are then tested in a tablet or pill testing device (15) according
to prescribed quality features,

characterized by

a) a set of scales (2, 3) which has an electronic interface and on which a container
(5, 6) is positioned, whereby said set of scales can continuously measure the weight

of the container currently being filled, including its content of tablets or pills, and
transmits a corresponding electric signal,
b) an identification means of the container (5, 6),
c) an electronic computer and control unit which is associated with the tablet or pill
testing device (15) and to which the current electric signal from the scales as well as

the identification of the corresponding container (5, 6) are transmitted, whereby, at
prescribed intervals, tablets or pill samples are taken from the tablet or pill stream

which is flowing into the container currently being filled and transported to the tablet
or pill testing device and then tested,
d) a storage and output unit (16, 17) located in the tablet or pill testing device (15)
for the storage and output of the test results, associated with the container (5, 6) currently

being filled, whereby the test results of all of the samples taken for a given
container are compiled.
Device according to Claim 6,

characterized in that

the prescribed intervals for taking the samples are weight-controlled in increments as
a function of the increasing weight of the container (5, 6) during the filling, for

example, in n-kg increments, or else exclusively time-controlled in time intervals, for
example, in n-minute increments.
