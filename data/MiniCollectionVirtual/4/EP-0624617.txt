A process for the production of low-viscosity, water-soluble polymer dispersions
on an aqueous basis, containing a water-soluble polymerizate A) constituted of the

following monomeric components:

a1) from 99 to 70 wt.-% of at least one water-soluble monomer,
a2) from 1 to 30 wt.-% of at least one hydrophobic monomer, and optionally
a3) from 0 to 20 wt.-% of at least one amphiphilic monomer,

wherein the monomer components a1), a2) and a3) are balanced such as to make
100 wt.-%, and the polymers A) have an average molecular weight M
w

polymerizate A) is prepared in an aqueous dispersion in the presence of from 1 to

50 wt.-%, based on 100 wt.-% of water as reaction medium, of at least one polymeric
dispersant D) which is incompatible with the water-soluble polymer A), has an average

molecular weight M
w

group selected from ether, hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfonic, sulfate ester, amino, amido,

imino, tertiary amino and/or quaternary ammonium groups, and subsequently, at least
one polymeric dispersant D), likewise in aqueous solution, is added in a second step,
