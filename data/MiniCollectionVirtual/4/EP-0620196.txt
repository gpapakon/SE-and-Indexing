<ABSTRACT>
An operating mechanism for a glassware forming machine is 
located on a horizontal table of the machine. A locating 

sleeve is secured to a lower face of the table and serves to 
determine the vertical alignment of the operating mechanism 

while a clamping device determines the vertical location of 
the mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with machines for the
manufacture of glassware.One of the most widely used types of machines for the
manufacture of glassware is the so-called I.S. machine,
which machine comprises a plurality of identical sections
arranged side by side, the sections operating continuously
out of time with each other to produce glassware. The I.S.
machine has developed over the last sixty years from the
original machine of this type described in US Patent 1911119
- Ingle.While during this period of sixty years there have been
many improvements in I.S. machines, e.g. increased number of
sections, increased numbers of moulds in each section,
electronic control mechanisms replacing mechanical
controls, the basic mechanical structure of the I.S. machine
has remained unaltered.Among the features which are common to almost all
existing I.S. machines are the following;
1. The various mechanisms of the machine are integrated
into a machine frame, and access to repair such mechanism is
difficult.2. The various mechanisms are generally pneumatically
operated, and a complex array of piping is necessary to
provide the required supplies of compressed air. This
piping is very time consuming [and thus expensive] not only
to assemble in manufacture but also to repair.3. If any substantial repair is necessary to a section,
the whole I.S. machine [i.e. all the sections] has to be
shut down while the repair is carried out.4. The various sections are mounted side by side in a
machine frame, having upright frame members which support
ancillary mechanisms, for example gob distributors. Air
supplies to the various sections are provided from piping 
leading from these upright frame members. Consequently
there is a risk of different pneumatic conditions obtaining
in sections remote from the upright frame members and those
close to them, a risk which increases with the number of
sections in the machine which is now frequently 12 or more.It is one of the objects of the present invention to
provide an operating mechanism for a glassware making
machine which is easily mounted in the machine in the
correct operating position and easily removed for repair or
replacement.The present invention provides an operating mechanism
for a glassware making machine comprising an operating
assembly and a locating assembly for locating and securing
the operating assembly in an aperture in a horizontal table
of the machine
   the operating assembly comprising
a piston and cylinder device comprising a first
cylinder and a piston
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An operating mechanism for a glassware making machine
comprising an operating assembly and a locating assembly for

locating and securing the operating assembly in an aperture
(266) in a horizontal table (178) of the machine

   the operating assembly comprising

a piston and cylinder device comprising a first
cylinder (618) and a piston rod (614)
operating members (610) operated by movement of the
piston rod
a locating cylinder (624) secured to the first cylinder
(618) and having an external diameter which is less than the

external diameter of the first cylinder
the axis of the first cylinder, the piston rod and the
locating cylinder all being parallel

   and the locating assembly comprising

a cylindrical locating sleeve (606) secured to a lower
face of the table (178) of the machine surrounding the

aperture (266) with its axis vertical which sleeve has an
internal diameter corresponding to the external diameter of

the first cylinder
a clamping device (632,640,642) mounted on an upper
face of the table
the arrangement being such that the operating mechanism
may be positioned extending through the aperture (266), the

locating cylinder (624) being positioned in the aperture
(266) and clamped against vertical movement by the clamping

device, and the first cylinder (618) of the piston and
cylinder device being located in the locating sleeve (606)

which determines the vertical alignment of the operating
assembly.
An operating mechanism according to claim 1 comprising
a vertical screw threaded bore (650) in a wall of the first

cylinder (618) and a screw threaded bolt (648) which extends
through the table (178), whereby rotation of the bolt

adjusts the vertical position of the operating assembly with
respect to the table.
An operating mechanism according to claim 2 comprising
a cushioning device (654) positioned in a lower end portion

of the first cylinder, a gear wheel (658) mounted for
rotation about the axis of the first cylinder and having a

central screw threaded bore, a threaded boss (656) on the
cushioning device which engages with the threaded bore, an

extended pinion (662) engaging the gear wheel (658) and
mounted on a vertical shaft (664) extending through the

locating sleeve to the upper side of the table, the pinion
(662) being of such a length that it engages the gear wheel

(658) at both extremes of vertical height adjustment of the
operating assembly.
