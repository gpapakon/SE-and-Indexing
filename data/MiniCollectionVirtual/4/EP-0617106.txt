<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition useful for
viscosifying a water-based fluid comprising
a blend of a specific viscosity promoter and a specific magnesium compound.Water-based fluids such as, for example, drilling fluids,
milling fluids, mining fluids, water-based metal working fluids, food
additives and water-based paints, are useful in a variety of industrial
applications. It is well known to those skilled in the art of drilling
wells to tap subterranean deposits of natural resources, such as gas,
geothermal steam or oil, especially when drilling by the rotary method
or the percussion method wherein cuttings must be removed from the bore
hole, it is necessary to use a drilling fluid. The use of water-based fluids in, for example, workover and
completion fluids in oil field operations is also well known to those
skilled in the art. Workover fluids are those fluids used during
remedial work in a drilled well. Such remedial work includes removing
tubing, replacing a pump, cleaning out sand or other deposits, logging,
etc. Workover also broadly includes steps used in preparing an existing
well for secondary or tertiary recovery such as polymer addition,
micellar flooding, steam injection, etc.Completion fluids are those fluids used during drilling and
during the steps of completion, or recompletion, of the well.
Completion operation can include perforating the casing, setting the
tubing and pump, etc. Both workover and completion fluids are used in
part to control well pressure, to stop the well from blowing out while
it is being completed or worked over, or to prevent the collapse of
casing from over pressure.WPI Derwent Abstracts 92-240202 of SU-A-1 668 376 discloses a mud for
drilling of oil and gas wells. The mud contains potassium hydroxide,
bentonite, hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile, cement dust, waste of electrolytic A1
production and water.Chemicals are added to the water-based fluids for various
reasons that include, but are not limited to, increasing viscosity,
reducing corrosion, and increasing the density of the fluids. For
example, chemicals such as, for example, water-thickening polymers serve
to increase the viscosity of the water-based fluids, when used as
workover fluids or completion fluids, to retard the migration of the
brines into the formation and to lift drilled solids from the wellbore.However, the above-discussed chemicals are often unstable at
the temperatures of various oil reservoirs and are often subject to
biodegradation. An inorganic chemical such as, for example,
