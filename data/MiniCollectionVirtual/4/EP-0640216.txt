<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a separation method
which finds application in the detection of species (e.g.
in immunoassay and in immunosensors), and to a method
suitable for use in detection,
to the use a sensor in the method of detection in accordance
with the present invention, and to the use of a test kit in
a method in accordance with the present invention.According to one aspect of the present invention
there is provided a separation method, suitable for use
in an immunoassay method for the detection of an analyte
species, which separation method includes arranging for
an auxiliary species and a binding species for the
auxiliary species to undergo specific binding, said
auxiliary species not being a primary species and said
auxiliary species being a ligand and said auxiliary
species being provided on a support material, said
support material being substantially non-permeable, said
binding species being an antibody capable of specific
binding with the auxiliary species and said binding
species being capable of being linked with a primary
species by means of a linkage which involves a link, of a
non-specific binding type, to the binding species, said
binding species being arranged to be linked with a
primary species by means of said linkage.An example of a link of a non-specific binding type
is a covalent link. Thus, for example, the linkage may
involve a covalent link to the binding species.Another example of a link of a non-specific binding
type is a link which involves adsorption. Thus, for
example, a binding species and a primary species may be
linked by both being adsorbed on a suitable material
(e.g. a carrier material such as latex particles). The binding species may be linked with the primary
species directly or indirectly (e.g. via other species).Thus, for example, where the binding species is
arranged to be linked directly to a primary species the
linkage may be a link of a non-specific binding type
(e.g. a covalent link) between the binding species and
the primary species.By way of further example, where the binding species
is arranged to be linked indirectly to a primary species
the linkage may include one or more other species, and
one or more links, as required, at least one of which
links being a link, of a non-specific binding type, to
the binding species.It is to be understood that where one or more links
are involved in the linkage, one of the links will be a
link of a non-specific binding type and any further link
or links in the linkage may be of any suitable type (e.g.
non-spe
