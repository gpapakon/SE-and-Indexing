<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an optoelectronic device (10) with a coaxial 
module which comprises a first holder (2) and a second holder (6) fastened thereto, in 

which holders are present an optoelectronic component (3), preferably a semiconductor 
diode laser (3), hermetically sealed off from the surroundings outside the module (1), 

and a glass fibre (7) aligned therewith, respectively. Conductors (22), for example 
connection pins (220) to which the component (3) is connected, project from the module 

(1). Such a module (1) forms a reliable and effective component-glass fibre coupling 
and is highly suitable for use in optical glass fibre communication systems. The 

invention also relates to a method of manufacturing such a device (10). 
A disadvantage of such a module (1) is that it is less suitable for 
applications in which a flat mounting, for example on a printed circuit board, is desired. 
According to the invention, the device (10) also comprises a box (20) in 
which the module (1) is accommodated. At least one side face (21) of the box (20) is 

provided with at least one row of second conductors (22) which are passed therethrough 
in an insulated manner, while the box (20) has an opening (23) through which the glass 

fibre (7) projects from the box (20). The box (20) further comprises means (30, 40) by 
which the module (1) is fastened (30) in the box (20), and
 by which the first conductors 
(5) are electrically connected (40) to the second conductors (22). The device (10) 

according to the invention may be readily mounted on a printed circuit board (60) in a 
compact arrangement. A further advantage is that the box (20) need not be sealed off 

hermetically. The device is also readily manufactured by means of a method according 
to the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optoelectronic device comprising a coaxial
module comprising a first holder for an optoelectronic component, preferably a
semiconductor diode laser, which is hermetically sealed off from the atmosphere outside
the module and is electrically connected to first conductors passed through a bottom
plate of the first holder in an insulated manner and to a second holder which is
connected to the first holder and which is to accommodate an optical glass fibre aligned
relative to the component. The invention also relates to a method of manufacturing such
a device. An optoelectronic component and a semiconductor diode laser will often be
referred to hereinafter as component and laser.Such devices are widely used in systems for optical glass fibre
communication.Such a device is known from European Patent application no. 89201390.5
published under no. 0 345 874 on 13-12-1989 and comprises a laser-glass fibre
coupling. The reliability of the module is high owing to the fact that the laser present
within the module is hermetically sealed off from the surroundings of the module. It can
be connected to, for example, a printed circuit board by means of the conductors which
are passed through the bottom plate of the laser in an insulated manner.A disadvantage of the known device is that, when it is mounted on e.g. a
printed circuit board, it is perpendicular to the printed circuit board with its greatest
dimension, i.e. the axial dimension, so that this form of final mounting requires
comparatively much space. Moreover, the first connection conductors of the module,
which are often arranged in a circle, are less suitable for a number of applications,
especially when a "IC-type" final mounting of the device and/or a very high system
speed is required.The invention has for its object to provide a device of the land mentioned
in the opening paragraph which does not suffer from the disadvantages mentioned
above, or at least to a much lesser degree. According to the invention, a device of the land mentioned in the opening
paragraph is for this purpose characterized in that the device comprises a box in which
the module is accommodated and of which at least one side face is provided with at
least one row of second conductors which are passed therethrough in an insulated
manner, which side face has a opening through which the optical glass fibre projects
from the box, while said box also comprises means by which the module is fastened in
the box and by which the first conductors are electrically
