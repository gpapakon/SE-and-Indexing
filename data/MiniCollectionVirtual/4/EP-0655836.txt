<ABSTRACT>
In a method for controlling analog actuators by means of pulse width modulation:   a) a duty ratio is specified as relative ratio between pulse period and total period of a control period, b) an addition value is defined as product of the predetermined duty ratio and a maximum addition value, c) addition steps follow one another progressively with a certain cycle time and in each case predetermined addition value, d) in one addition step, the addition value is added by an addition element with storage function and overflow detection to the value stored in the addition element, the addition result is stored as a new storage value in the addition element, the logic state at the output of the addition element is fixed by the overflow occurring during the addition step, and the actuator is controlled in dependence on the respective logic state at the output of the addition element.

<CLAIMS>
Method of controlling analogue control elements wherein:

a) a duty ratio (TV) is provided as the relative ratio of the
pulse duration (t
PU
) to the periodic time (T) of a control

period,
b) an addition value (AW) is defined as the product of the given
duty ratio (TV) and a maximum addition value (AMW),
c) adding steps each having a specific cycle time (t
Z
) and a
respective predetermined addition value (AW) follow in

succession,
d) in each adding step, the addition value (AW) is added by an
adding member to a value stored in the adding member which

incorporates a storage function and an overflow detecting
function, the result of the addition is stored in the adding

member as a new storage value, the logical state at the output
of the adding member is determined by the overflow occurring

during the adding step, and the control element is controlled in
dependence on the logical state existing at the output of the

adding member.
Method in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, in
each adding step, a logical "1" is provided at the output of the

adding member in the case where an overflow occurs and a logical
"0" is provided when an overflow does not occur.
Method in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the maximum addition value (AMW) is determined by the maximum

storage capacity of the adding member.
Method in accordance with any of the Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that, in the case where the control of the 

control element is constant, the duty ratio (TV) and hence the
addition value (AW) is provided as a constant value in each

adding step.
Method in accordance with any of the Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that, in the case where the control of the

control element is variable, the duty ratio (TV) and hence the
addition value (AW) can be provided in an arbitrary manner for

each adding step (AW).
