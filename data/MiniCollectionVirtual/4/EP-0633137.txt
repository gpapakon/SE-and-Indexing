<ABSTRACT>
The ink-jet print cartridge, which has an 
internal accumulator for maintaining appropriate back 

pressure within the pen reservoir, and a bubble 
generator for providing additional regulation, is 

refilled by a process that provides for the 
reestablishment of the necessary back pressure upon 

refilling and that prevents leakage arising as a result 
of the refilling operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method of
refilling the reservoir of an ink-jet print cartridge.Ink-jet printing generally involves the
controlled delivery of ink drops from an ink-jet print
cartridge reservoir to a printing surface. One type of
ink-jet printing, known as drop-on-demand printing,
employs a print cartridge or pen that has a print head
that is responsive to control signals for ejecting drops
of ink from an associated ink reservoir.One type of drop-on-demand print head uses a
thermal bubble mechanism for ejecting drops. A thermal
bubble type print head includes a thin-film resistor
that is heated to cause sudden vaporization of a small
portion of the ink. The rapid expansion of the ink
vapor forces a small amount of ink through an associated
one of a number of nozzles in the print head.Conventional drop-on-demand print heads are
effective for ejecting or "pumping" ink drops from a pen
reservoir, but require mechanisms for preventing ink
from leaking through the print head nozzles when the
print head is inactive. Accordingly, drop-on-demand
techniques require that the fluid in the ink reservoir
must be stored in a manner that provides a slight back
pressure at the print head to prevent ink leakage from
the pen whenever the print head is inactive. As used
herein, the term "back pressure" means the partial 
vacuum within the pen reservoir that resists the flow of
ink through the print head. Back pressure is considered
in the positive sense so that an increase in back
pressure represents an increase in the partial vacuum.
Accordingly, back pressure is measured in positive
terms, such as water column height.The back pressure at the print head must be at
all times strong enough for preventing ink leakage. The
back pressure, however, must not be so strong that the
print head is unable to overcome the back pressure to
eject ink drops. Moreover, the ink-jet pen must be
designed to operate despite environmental changes that
cause fluctuations in the back pressure.A severe environmental change that affects
reservoir back pressure occurs during air transport of
an ink-jet pen. In this instance, ambient atmosphere
pressure decreases as the aircraft gains altitude and is
depressurized. As ambient air pressure decreases, a
correspondingly greater amount of back pressure is
needed to keep ink from leaking through the print head.
Accordingly, the level of back pressure within the pen
must be regulated during times of ambient pressure drop.The back pressure within an ink-jet pen
reservoir is also

A method of adding ink to the reservoir (24) of a print
cartridge (22) that has a print head (30) for selectively

ejecting ink through nozzles (29) in the print head (30),
wherein the cartridge has a movable accumulator (20) that is

contained within the reservoir and defines a volume that is
in fluid communication with ambient air, comprising the

steps of:

occluding the fluid communication between the
accumulator volume and ambient air;
occluding the nozzles (29) of the print head (30)
from ambient air

before
adding the ink;
adding ink to the reservoir (24); and
restoring the fluid communication between the
accumulator volume and ambient air.
The method of claim 1, wherein the adding step comprises
providing the nozzles (29) with a supply of ink outside of

the reservoir (24) for a time sufficient for ink to be drawn
from the supply through the nozzles and into the reservoir.
The method of claim 1, wherein the adding step comprises
the substeps of opening the reservoir (24) to receive ink;

adding the ink; and closing the reservoir.
The method of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein an
orifice (136) is formed in the cartridge (22) to provide

fluid communication between ambient air and the interior of
the reservoir (24), the method comprisin
g the steps of:

blocking the fluid communication provided by the orifice
(136) before the step of adding ink;
restoring the fluid communication provided by the
orifice (136) after the step of restoring the fluid

communication between the accumulator volume and ambient
air.
A method of adding ink to the reservoir (24) of a print 
cartridge (22) that has a print head (30) for selectively

ejecting ink through nozzles (29) in the print head, wherein
the cartridge has an accumulator (20) that is contained

within the reservoir and that defines an expandable volume
that is in fluid communication with ambient air, and wherein

an orifice (136) is formed in the cartridge to provide fluid
communication between ambient air and the interior of the

reservoir, comprising the steps of:

occluding the nozzles (29) of the print head (30)
from ambient air

before
adding ink to the reservoir (24);
opening the reservoir (24) to receive ink;
adding ink to the reservoir (24);
applying pressure for expanding the accumulator volume;
closing the reservoir (24); and
removing the pressure.
The method of claim 5, including the step of blocking
the fluid communication provided by the orifice (136) before

adding ink to the reservoir (24).
