<ABSTRACT>
A piston (14) for an internal combustion engine (10) is provided with a reaction chamber (44) for generating radical fuel species during a combustion cycle for use during the next succeeding combustion cycle. The reaction chamber (44) is located adjacent a piston crown recess (42) and is in communication with the main combustion chamber (30) of the engine through discrete orifices (48) that are intended to separately control the supply of fuel and air to the reaction chamber (44) for fuel injected engines and to enhance reaction chamber function in fuel aspirating engines. The discrete fuel and air control orifices (48) are particularly beneficial for use in high swirl, direct injected combustion chambers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of internal combustion engines and in particular
pistons for such engines.A piston arrangement for achieving improved control over ignition and
combustion characteristics of a fuel charge in an internal combustion engine and a
process for achieving such controlled ignition and combustion by the generation and
management of fuel radical species within the combustion chamber of such an
engine is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,898,135 granted February 6, 1990. In
accordance with the patent, a piston for an internal combustion engine, which may
be spark or compression ignited, includes a central recess for receiving the majority
of each charge during each combustion cycle of the engine and a reaction chamber 
adjacent the recess for receiving a portion of the fuel and air of each charge.
During each combustion cycle, the portion of the charge that is disposed in the
reaction chamber undergoes a cold flame reaction to produce fuel radical species
that are discharged in a next succeeding combustion cycle for seeding the next
charge admitted to the combustion chamber.In accordance with the teachings of the aforesaid patent, the generation and
management of fuel radical species requires control over the manner in which the
fuel and air of each charge is admitted into the reaction chamber and also the
manner in which outgasing of the reaction chamber into the combustion zone
occurs. In accordance with the prior patent, a continuous slot orifice having critical
dimensions is provided to primarily receive fuel and air into the reaction chamber
under choked flow conditions during the compression event of each combustion
cycle and to enable outgasing of the chamber into the main combustion chamber
also under choked flow conditions, whereby a supply of fuel radical species is
preserved during each combustion cycle for use in the next combustion cycle due
to the time delay in outgasing of the reaction chamber. Optionally, in accordance
with the teachings of the prior patent, one or more discrete orifices may also be
provided to provide communication between the piston recess and the reaction
chamber to achieve better control over the admission of fuel to the reaction
chamber.For a complete discussion of the benefits provided by the piston
configuration described in the prior patent, and for a more complete explanation of
the manner in which fuel radical species are generated and managed in accordance
with a piston having a configuration as described above, reference may be had to
