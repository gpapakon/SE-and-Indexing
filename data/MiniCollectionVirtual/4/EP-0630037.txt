thickness, can be produced at a low cost, and moreover, can display 

an image free from non-uniformity of luminance throughout 
the whole screen. The display includes a linear hot cathode 

(1) for emitting theremoelectrons, a porous cover electrode (3) 
for extracting the electrons from the hot cathode (1) and accelerating 

them, a control electrode (4) disposed substantially parallel 
to the linear thermal cathode (1) and having holes (4a) for 

passing the emitted electron beams (2) for controlling the electron 
beams (2), a luminescent member disposed on a curved 

plane for emitting light upon irradiation of the electron beams 
(2), and a focusing electrode (10A) disposed between the control 

electrode (4) and the luminescent member, wherein the focusing 
electrode (10A) is so divied into focusing electrodes (10₁), (10₂), 

(10₃) as to constitute the image display. When each of the luminescent 
member, the focusing electrode (10A) and the control 

electrode (4) is shaped into a curved surface and each of 
the linear hot cathode (1) and the porous cover electrode (3) is 

shaped into a planar shape, a second grid is disposed between

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flat-type
image display apparatus. More particularly, it relates to
an improved image display apparatus with less luminance
unevenness.Figs. 16 and 17 are, respectively, an exploded
perspective view of a conventional flat-type image display
apparatus as disclosed in, for example, Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publications Nos. 226949/1991 and
184239/1988 and an enlarged, partially broken away view of
a principal part of another example. In Figs. 16 and 17,
numeral 1 denotes string like hot cathodes each of which
is connected to a support and emits electrons when
energized, and numeral 3 denotes perforated cover
electrodes each covering each string like hot cathode 1
and each shaped elliptic in section. Each cover electrode
3 has small apertures permitting electrons to pass
therethrough and serves to lead electrons out of the
corresponding string like hot cathode 1 when applied with
an appropriate potential. An electron-emitting source 40
comprises the string like hot cathodes 1, perforated cover
electrodes 3 and back electrodes 42 fixing the cover
electrodes 3 arranged in parallel and each assuming a
potential equal to that of the corresponding cover
electrode 3. Numeral 8 denotes a front glass which is
coated on the inner surface thereof with three types of
luminous elements (not shown) in a dotted or striped
manner and with an aluminum film (not shown) covering
these luminous elements for electric conduction, the
luminous elements being adapted to be excited by electrons
emitted from the electron-emitting source 40 to emit light
in respective colors, i.e., red, green and blue. In such a configuration, an application of a
voltage of about 5 to about 30 kV to the aluminum film of
the front glass 8 causes electrons to accelerate and
thereby the luminous elements (not shown) to be excited to
emit light. Numeral 4 denotes a control electrode for
permitting or shutting off the passage of electrons led
out by each cover electrode 3 toward the front glass 8,
the control electrode being interposed between the front
glass 8 and the string like hot cathodes 1. Numeral 10
denotes a focusing electrode to be applied with a
predetermined voltage for causing electron beam having
passed through an electron-pass aperture 4a of the control
electrode 4 to pass through an electron-pass aperture 10a
and to be focused upon the corresponding dot of luminous
element. The control electrode 4 includes a surface-insulative
substrate 5 having electron-pass apertures 4a
corresponding to pixels
