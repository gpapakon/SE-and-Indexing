<ABSTRACT>
A camera or apparatus (1) adapted to use an image 
recording medium cartridge (101) having a cover for allowing 

an image recording medium (108) to exit from or withdraw into 
the image recording medium cartridge, or a device 

adapted in the camera or apparatus (1), includes inhibition 
means for, when the cover of the cartridge loaded in 

the camera or apparatus (1) is open, inhibiting the 
cartridge (101) from being unloaded from the camera or 

apparatus (1), and disabling means for disabling an 
operation of the inhibition means when the cover of the 

cartridge loaded in the camera or apparatus (1) is open.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in
a camera adapted to use a film cartridge having a
movable light shield door.Cameras each having a movable light shield door
opening/closing device for opening/closing a movable
light shield door formed on a film cartridge are
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application
Nos. 1-191836 and 1-191837. In these prior arts, when
a switch for detecting if a cartridge chamber cover is
closed detects that the cartridge chamber cover is
closed, a movable light shield door is opened, and a
film is extracted via the movable light shield door to
prevent film exposure. After a predetermined period of
time has elapsed from the end of the rewind operation
of a film, if the movable light shield door is kept
open, an alarm is generated. Furthermore, the prior
art describes an embodiment which prevents inadvertent
exposure of a film by inhibiting the cartridge chamber
cover from being opened when the movable light shield
door is open. The movable light shield door is also disclosed in JP-A-5 150 344 and
US Patent No 4, 938, 429. In this last reference, a light
shield door is opened/closed by pivoting a rotatable
shaft.European Patent Specification No EP-A-0545098
discloses a camera for use with a self opening cassette
and having a door through which a cassette can be either
mounted or withdrawn. Means are provided whereby the
door cannot be opened if a cassette is mounted in the
camera and a film is protruding from the cassette.In the above mentioned prior arts, an operation
member for opening/closing the cartridge chamber cover
of a camera is locked while the movable light shield door
is open. A lock member for locking the operation member
is operated integrally with the movable light shield door
by the driving force from a motor. In this arrangement,
if the movable light shield door cannot be mechanically
closed due to some accident (for example, the motor is
locked or a film portion is extracted from a cartridge),
the lock member cannot be operated even if the lock
member can be forcibly externally operated.Therefore, in the above mentioned prior art, when
the movable light shield door cannot be closed due to
some accident, the cartridge chamber cover of the camera
can never be opened, and the film cartridge cannot be
unloaded.In accordance with the present invention there is
provided apparatus adapted to use an image recording
medium cartridge and as set out in claim 1 and a camera
as defined in claim 6. Other aspects of the present invention will become
apparent
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Apparatus adapted to use an image recording medium
cartridge (101) having a light shield door (104) which

allows when open an image recording medium (105) to be
withdrawn from or retracted into the cartridge, the

apparatus comprising:

a housing (1,5);
a cartridge chamber inside the housing;
a cartridge chamber cover (5) movable between open
and closed positions so as to allow an image recording

medium cartridge to be loaded into and withdrawn from the
cartridge chamber, and
inhibition means (9,60) which
permits said cover (5) to be opened

only if the light shield door of the cartridge mounted in the apparatus is closed,
characterised by the provision of relatively

inaccessible disabling means (8, 60d) on the external surface of the housing adapted to
override said inhibition means to enable said cover to

be opened regardless of whether said light shield door
is open or closed.
Apparatus according to claim 1 and comprising an
operation member (7) adapted to open and close said

cartridge chamber cover, said inhibition means comprising
a lock member (9, 60) which engages with said operation

member when a cartridge is mounted in the cartridge
chamber and the light shield door of the cartridge is

open so as to render said operation member inoperable,
and said disabling means comprising a release member (8) 

adapted to release the engagement of said operation
member and said lock member regardless of whether the

light shield door is open or closed.
Apparatus according to claim 2 and including drive
means (10) for opening the light shield door of a

cartridge when the cartridge is mounted in the apparatus.
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the
inhibition means comprise a pivoted member (9, 60)

adapted to be moved into engagement with said operation
member by said drive means when the light shield door of

a cartridge is opened by the drive means.
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the
disabling means enable the pivoted member to be moved

linearly out of engagement with said operation member
against spring biassing.
A camera incorporating the apparatus as claimed in any
one of the preceding claims.
A camera according to claim 6 comprising
a cartridge housing holding an image recording medium in the form

of a film, the cartridge having a light shield door
through which the film can either be withdrawn or

retracted.
