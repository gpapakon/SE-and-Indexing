<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a building roof with inner cladding (12) and sub-roof (14) and heat-insulating material (16) arranged therebetween, the window frame (28) of a roof window (25) is arranged over a cutout (24) in the sub-roof (14). In this arrangement, the window frame (28) is seated on an additional frame (30) consisting of a heat-insulating material, in particular pinewood, and the additional frame (30) engages into the cutout (24) in the sub-roof (14). The additional frame (30) is arranged such that it can be displaced in parallel, via adjustable fastening devices (38), with respect to the inner cladding (12) and/or the sub-roof (14), in a vertical direction with respect to these, and is thus suitable for all sub-roofs. The additional frame (30) can be mounted simply and quickly and permits an optimum degree of sealing with respect to water and wind and an absolute degree of sealing upon connection of vapour barriers.
