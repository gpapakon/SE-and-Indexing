<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for chilling a food product (4) which includes a food 
distribution device (12) having a pair of circular members (16, 18) including at 

least one spaced-apart partition (20) defining a food receiving area; the circular 
members (16, 18) rotating to cause food delivered to the food product receiving 

area to fall into a food storage compartment (10) in a uniform manner; and a 
cryogen releasing device (60) connected to one of the circular members which 

uniformly distributes a cryogenic substance to the food product within the food 
storage compartment (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to a device for chilling a food product in which 
the food product is uniformly distributed within a food receiving vessel while simultaneously 
being uniformly treated with a cryogenic substance to effect cooling. Commercial procedures for treating freshly killed poultry or meat generally require that the 
temperature of the fresh killed product be reduced in accordance with standards established 
by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Conventionally, the fresh killed 
product is treated with brine to lower the temperature of the food product to about 7oC 
(about 45°F). This procedure reduces water loss in the product, prevents the growth of 
bacteria and extends the shelf life of the food product. The brine treated product is then cut and/or ground as desired prior to packaging. The 
cutting/ grinding step generates heat thereby increasing the temperature of the food 
product. Prior to packaging the food product, however, it is necessary to lower the 
temperature of the food product in the range of from about -1oC to 4.5oC (about 30 to 40°F). Conventional methods of chilling the food product after it has been cut/ground and treated 
with brine involve manual operations. Specifically, the food product is placed in a large, 
often times rectangular vessel. Dry ice in the form of pellets is shoveled into the vessel to 
lower the temperature of the food product to meet USDA requirements. Such manual systems, however, are inefficient and inconsistent. The shoveling of dry ice 
into the receiving vessel often produces localised cold spots so that a portion of the food 
product is chilled to lower than necessary temperatures while other portions of the food 
product remain above desired temperatures. To date, there is no apparatus or method 
which uniformly distributes the food product within the storage vessel and uniformly treats 
the food product with a coolant as it is distributed within the vessel. EP-A-0422280 discloses the cooling and/or freezing of foodstuffs in a process in which they 
are placed in a cooling chamber into which liquefied gas is sprayed, initially so as to bring the 
surface layers of the product to their freezing point, and the product is then allowed to cool 
freely until its centre reaches a similar level. More gas is then introduced to cool the product 
further.  
 It would be a significant advance in the art of chilling food products, if the food product can 
be uniformly distributed within the food receiving vessel

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (2) for chilling a food product (4) comprising a food storage compartment 
(10) for storing the food product (4) at rest and means for cooling the food product (4) 

therein, wherein 

(a) the food storage compartment (10) receives the food product (4) while in 
motion from a food distribution means (12); 
(b) the food distribution means (12) are operatively engaged to 
the top of the food storage compartment (10) for receiving the food product 

(4) from a source (6) and for uniformly distributing the food product (4) within the 
food storage compartment (10); and 
(c) means (60) are provided for uniformly distributing a coolant to cool the food 
product (4) while the food product is contained within the food storage 

compartment (10). 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in that the means (60) for cooling the 
food product comprises a cryogen releasing means (60) operatively engaged to the 

underside (16) of the food distribution means for uniformly releasing a cryogenic 

substance onto the food product (4) as the food product (4) is uniformly distributed 
within the food storage compartment to thereby cool the food product (4). 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 characterised in that the cryogen releasing means 
comprises a conduit (64) affixed to a lower surface of the first circular member (16) 

and connected to a source of a cryogenic substance (68), and a releasing means 
(72) operatively connected to the conduit for releasing the cryogenic substance as 

the first circular member (16) is rotated. 
An apparatus as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 3 wherein the food distribution means 
(12) comprises: 


(a) a first circular member (16) having an upper and lower surface (22, 24)and 
an opening (26) therein sufficient for the food product to pass therethrough;  

 
(b) means (46) for rotating the first circular member; 
(c) a second circular member (18) positioned above the first circular member 
(16) comprising at least one partition (20) and together with the upper surface 

(22) of the first circular member (16) forming at least one food receiving area 
on the upper surface (22) of the first circular member; 
(d) means (40) for rotating the second circular member (18) in a non-congruent 
manner with respect to the first circular member (16); 
 
whereby the food product (4) which is placed on the upper surface (22) of the first 

circular member is caused to fall through the opening (26) in the first circular 
member into the food storage compartment (10) when one of said partitions (20a) 

contacts the food product (4) and urges said food product (4) into said opening (26). 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 4 characterised in that the means (46) for rotating 
the first circular member (16) rotates the first circular member (16) at a speed 

different than that of the second circular member (18). 
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 4 or Claim 5 characterised in that the means (46) 
for rotating the first circular member (16) rotates the first circular member (16) in a 

different direction than the second circular member (18). 
A method of chilling a food product with a coolant comprising the steps of: 

(a) delivering a food product to an upper surface of a first circular member 
having an opening therein, said opening adapted to receive the food product 

and deliver the food product to a food storage vessel; 
b) rotating the first circular member; 
(c) rotating a second circular member in a non- congruent manner with respect 
to said first circular member; said second circular member, comprising at 

least one partition, together with the first circular member forming at least one 
food receiving area on the surface of the first circular member; said second 

circular member being rotated in a manner so that the partitions contact the  
 

food product in said food receiving portions and urge the food product into 
said opening; and 
(d) adding a coolant to the food storage vessel in uniform distribution to cool the 
food product therein. 
A method as claimed in Claim 7 wherein the step of adding a coolant to the food 
storage compartment comprises releasing a cryogenic substance from the first 

circular member into the food storage compartment as the first circular member is 
rotated. 
A method as claimed in Claim 8 wherein the cryogenic substance is released in the 
form of solid flakes. 
A method as claimed in Claim 8 wherein the cryogenic substance is released in the 
form of a liquid.
