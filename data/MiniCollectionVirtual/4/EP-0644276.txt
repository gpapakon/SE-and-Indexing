<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a method and an apparatus for removing 
scales from hot-rolled steel strips (1) to produce 

steel strips with excellent surface conditions. In a pickling 
facility to pickle the hot-rolled steel strip, the 

pickling method of this invention passes an electric current 
through the continuously fed, hot-rolled steel strip in one 

or more of a plurality of pickling tanks (4). A means to 
supply an electric current is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus
for descaling
hot-rolled steel strips according to the
first part of claim 1 and 8, respectively, as disclosed in the EP-A-0 513 753.Generally, steel sheets (carbon steel) are rolled
at temperatures of 800-900°C and thus black oxide
scales mainly of Fe3O4 form on the their surfaces. The
scales may damage the surface of the steel sheet in
the subsequent cold rolling process and therefore must
be removed. As the demand for automotive thin steel
sheet is currently increasing, the descaling at high
speed is becoming increasingly important.The conventional descaling methods for steel
strips are classified largely into a chemical and a
mechanical method. The mainstream of the chemical
method is a catenary pickling method, which involves
immersing and continuously passing steel plates
through tanks of acid solution to remove scales from
the steel sheets by chemical reactions. Among methods
having an enhanced efficiency of descaling oxides by
immersing in acid solution are a box dam method and a
jet flow method. The box dam method consists in
filling a rectangular parallelepiped container with
acid solution and passing steel plates through it for
pickling. The rectangular parallelepiped container
has weirs installed at the upper and lower surfaces 
thereof. The jet flow method, as described in the
Mitsubishi Juko Giho (Mitsubishi Heavy Industry
Technique) Vol. 29, No. 1 (1992-1), has a jet nozzle
installed in the box dam structure, whereby acid
solution is sprayed against the steel sheet to further
enhance the oxide scale removing effect.The mechanical descaling methods include a
rolling method, a polishing method, a shot blast
method and a repetitive bending method, all introduced
in the Hitachi Hyoron (Hitachi Review) Vol. 67, No. 4
(1985-4) as new technologies for high-speed descaling
facilities. Also available are a high-pressure water
spray method, a mechanical and pickling combination
method, and an ultrasonic pickling method introduced
in the Mitsubishi Juko Giho Vol. 2, No. 3, p. 289
(1965).The conventional pickling for steel strips uses a
dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl) because iron oxides
easily dissolve in it. The reactions that occur are
expressed by
Fe2O3 + 6HCl → 2FeCl3 + 3H2OFe3O4 + 8HCl → FeCl2 + 2FeCl3 + 4H2OTo speed up the descaling of oxides, the
reactions (1) and (2) need be accelerated. Because
this method utilizes a chemical dissolution reaction
of the oxide scale, a generally conceivable method for
efficient descaling may be by increasing
