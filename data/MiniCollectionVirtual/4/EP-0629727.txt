<ABSTRACT>
Knitted jacquard velvet made on a weft-stitch circular knitting machine, comprising a cylinder (C) equipped with latch needles and a plate (P) equipped with sinkers (13) displaceable between the needles (7) of the cylinder and making it possible to form loops of different heights, characterised in that each row comprises, in addition to a jersey or structured ground thread, various colour threads distributed successively to the needles as a function of the selection of a design to be produced, this being carried out by means of sinkers making it possible to obtain loops of different heights likewise selected as a function of the design, thus making it possible, after a finishing treatment (shearing), to obtain a relief velvet with non-sheared and sheared and multi-coloured loops.

Knitted fabric of two or three colours, made on

a circular weft knitting machine, comprising, in each
row, in addition to a jersey or structured ground

thread, various colour threads delivered successively to
the needles (7) of the knitting machine according to the

selection of a design to be produced, characterized in
that, having undergone a finishing treatment by

shearing, the fabric gives a relief appearence with
unsheared (NR) and sheared (R) multi-colour loops.
Process for producing a knitted fabric of two or
three colours on a circular weft knitting machine, the

cylinder (C) of which is equipped with latch needles (7)
and the plate (P) of which is equipped with sinkers (13)

displaceable between the needles (7) of the said
cylinder and which make it possible to form loops of

different height, comprising:

a knitting cycle such that the various
components of the fabric, ground thread and colour

threads, are knitted on one and the same stitch row and
not in successive rows, the various coloured threads

being delivered to the needles according to the
selection of a pattern to be produced;
the control and the displacements of the
sinkers (13) for the formation of the plush loops are

carried out by means of a selection system (S) causing
them to penetrate between the needles (7) by two predetermined

amounts, in such a way that the thread loops
around one or other of the two superposed zones (14, 15)

that the nose of the sinkers (13) has, this taking place
according to the designs to be produced;
after producing the fabric, a finishing
treatment is carried out [sic]
 by shearing at a level
lying above the loops (b) of short length, thus making

it possible to obtain a relief velour with multi-colour
unsheared (NR) and sheared (R) loops.
