<ABSTRACT>
A method for monitoring the speed of an automatically controlled vehicle during braking, which vehicle is equipped with a position (displacement) measuring device and an on-board control unit. The monitoring is performed by desired/actual speed comparison, in which the respective desired speed is calculated continuously from the distance covered by the vehicle and its prescribed braking curve. In order to obtain desired speed values at the density required for reliable monitoring of the braking curve, instead of calculating the square root, as is otherwise conventional, the method carries out an approximate integer computation on the basis of a secant circuit with equidistant corner points which is approximated to the square root function.

A method of supervising the speed of an automatically 
controlled vehicle, equipped with a distance meter and 

an on-board controller, during braking processes which 
are carried out with a predetermined, constant 

retardation in accordance with parabolic braking curves, 
wherein the actual speed of the vehicle is continuously 

compared with a nominal speed which is determined by the 
respective braking curve to be followed and the distance 

travelled by the vehicle and which is calculated by the 
on-board controller, and wherein a safety reaction is 

intiated if the comparison between actual speed and 
nominal speed gives a difference which exceeds a predetermined, 

maximum permissible value,
characterized in
 that to determine the 
nominal speed (VS), an integer approximation calculation 

is performed based on continuous secants (SK) which 
approximate the square-root function and have non-equidistant 

vertices (E1, E2). 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the coordinates of the vertices are calculated on the  

 
basis that the continuous secants do not deviate from 

the root function at any point by more than a predetermined 
amount (d). 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the coordinates of the vertices of the continuous 

secants are stored in the on-board controller. 
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the coordinates of the 

vertices of the continuous secants are calculated by the 
recurrence formula
