<ABSTRACT>
The system for monitoring the pressure of tyres operates in a normal mode for detecting punctures and underinflation, and in a mode for assisting reinflating the tyres. The switching between the two modes requires no intervention from the user: by detecting a rise in inflation pressure in a tyre, it is possible to deduce therefrom that the tyre in question is in the process of being reinflated.

A method of using the signals in a monitoring 
system for the tyres of a vehicle, said system 

supplying a measurement of the inflation pressure P for 
each tyre, the monitoring system having a normal 

operating mode consisting in alerting the driver of the 
vehicle when the pressure of one of the tyres is no 

longer considered normal, and a reinflation assistance 
operating mode, said system automatically switching 

from said normal operating mode to said reinflation 
assistance operating mode when a great variation in the 

inflation pressure of one of the tyres of the vehicle 
is detected, characterised in that at any time t, 


a) a filtered value P
F
 is calculated from P, 
representative of the prior conditions of the tyre 

existing before the instant t, such that: 


P
F
(t) = K
1
 P
F
 (t-1) + K
2
 P(t) with K
1
 + K
2
 = 1 
b) P is compared to P
F
, 
c) it is detected that the tyre observed is in the 
process of reinflation if the absolute value of P - P
F
 
is greater than a threshold value determined 

experimentally and a switch is made automatically to a 
reinflation assistance operating mode for the tyre in 

question. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the measurement P of the inflation pressure is 

expressed in percent relative to the nominal pressure 
for the tyre in question. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the reinflation assistance 

consists in providing a first alarm while the measured 
pressure P
i
(t) is lower than a minimum threshold P
i min
, 
and providing a second alarm distinct from the first  

 
when the measured pressure P
i
(t) is higher than a 
maximum threshold P
i max
. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that, after having determined that the 

absolute value of P - P
F
 is greater than the threshold 
selected for the tyre in question, a switch into 

reinflation assistance mode is only effected if the 
absolute value of P - P
F
 remains less than the threshold 
selected for all the other tyres of the same vehicle. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the reinflation assistance mode 

for a tyre is exited when the reinflation of another 
tyre is detected, or when the operating time in 

reinflation assistance mode for a given tyre has 
exceeded a preestablished period, or when other 

predetermined conditions are met.
