<ABSTRACT>
Radiographic elements are disclosed with 
dsilver halide emulsion layer units coated on opposite 

sides of a film support. The radiographic elements are 
constructed to reduce crossover during exposure by 

intensifying screens to minimal levels. To permit the 
minimal crossover radiographic elements to be employed to 

record both bone and soft tissue structure, a silver 
halide emulsion layer unit on one side of the support is 

chosen to exhibit a speed and contrast exceeding that of 
another silver halide emulsion layer unit on the opposite 

side of the support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to radiographic 
imaging. More specifically, the invention relates to 
double coated silver halide radiographic elements of 
the type employed in combination with intensifying 
screens. The term "double coated" as applied to a 
radiographic element means that emulsion layer units 
are coated on each of the two opposite sides of the 
support. The term "low crossover" as applied to double 
coated radiographic elements indicates a crossover of 
less than 10% within the wavelength range of imaging 
and when measured as more fully described below. The term "sensitometrically symmetric" means 
that the emulsion layer units on opposite sides of a 
double coated radiographic element produce identical 
characteristic curves when identically exposed. The term "sensitometrically asymmetric" means 
that the emulsion layer units on opposite sides of a 
double coated radiographic element produce 
significantly different characteristic curves when 
identically exposed. In medical radiography an image of a 
patient's tissue and bone structure is produced by 
exposing the patient to X-radiation and recording the 
pattern of penetrating X-radiation using a radiographic 
element containing at least one radiation-sensitive 
silver halide emulsion layer coated on a transparent 
(usually blue tinted) film support. The X-radiation 
can be directly recorded by the emulsion layer where 
only limited areas of exposure are required, as in 
dental imaging and the imaging of body extremities. 
However, a more efficient approach, which greatly  
 
reduces X-radiation exposures, is to employ an 
intensifying screen in combination with the 
radiographic element. The intensifying screen absorbs 
X-radiation and emits longer wavelength electromagnetic 
radiation which silver halide emulsions more readily 
absorb. Another technique for reducing patient 
exposure is to coat two silver halide emulsion layers 
on opposite sides of the film support to form a "double 
coated" radiographic element. Diagnostic needs can be satisfied at the 
lowest patient X-radiation exposure levels by employing 
a double coated radiographic element in combination 
with a pair of intensifying screens. The silver halide 
emulsion layer unit on each side of the support 
directly absorbs 1 to 2 percent of incident X-radiation. 
The front screen, the screen nearest the X-radiation 
source, absorbs a much higher percentage of 
X-radiation, but still transmits sufficient X-radiation 
to expose the back screen, the screen farthest from the 
X-radi
