Multi-chamber rotary piston internal combustion engine 
with several chambers arranged one after the other in which 

all engine functions take place simultaneously, beside 
to one another, during one revolution, the gas stream being 

continuous, characterized, at the one hand, by cylinders 
and pistons (1, 2, 3, 11) rotating and being moved on the 

inside for the functions of intake, precompression and 
compression, and, at the other hand, cylinders and pistons 

(22, 23) rotating and being moved on the outside for the 
functions of ignition, combustion, expansion and gas discharg
e, 
said cylinders and pistons being controlled with 

rotation symmetry through gear wheel transmissions by a 
central gear wheel shaft. 
Multi-chamber rotary piston internal combustion engine 
according to claim 1, characterized in that in a precompression 

cylinder bushing (18), two chambers (18a and b) 
which change in volume are formed by a double piston (1 

and 2) which rotates on the inside, and a rotation cylinder 
(3), in such a manner that a chamber (18b) located in front 

of the piston (1) in the direction of rotation is reduced 
from its full volume to zero during each revolution, and 

the gas mixtures contained in this chamber are pressed 
into the adjacent chamber (19), and that at the same time, 

a chamber (18a) located behind the piston (2) is increased 
from zero to its full volume during this rotation phase, 

and that as a result of the partial vacuum being produced 
in the chamber (18a), the fresh gas is drawn in through 

the inlet opening (12).  
 
Multi-chamber rotary piston internal combustion engine 
according to claim 2, characterized in that guide grooves 

(16) in both flat side walls of the precompression cylinder 
bushing (18) provide a rotation bed for the flanges (4) 

of a rotation cylinder (3), the diameter of which is less 
than that of the cylinder bushing (18), in such a manner 

that the rotation cylinder (3) forms a gas-tight seal with 
the rounded part of the cylinder bushing (18) at the peak 

(63) on the one side, and forms a sickle-shaped chamber 
(18a, b) with the cylinder bushing (18) towards the other 

side, that the ends of the cylinder mantle of the rotation 
cylinder (3), which is open at one end, are movably connected 

with the end faces of the compression pistons (1, 
2) by means of cylinder sliding blocks (8, 9), that these 

sliding blocks (8 + 9) allow the cylinder ends to slide 
up and down on the end faces of the pistons during the 

piston and cylinder revolutions, that the two pistons (1, 
2) can equalize their different angle positions relative 

to the inner cylinder (3) during a revolution by means 
of scissor-like movements relative to one another, that 

the precompression piston (1) is affixed on a shaft (5) 
which is fixed in place in the center of the precompression 

cylinder bushing (18) by means of the piston shaft pin 
(7), that the precompression piston (2) rotates on the 

same axle (6), that the precompression piston (1), driven 
via the shaft (5) by means of the gear transmissions, can 

move the rotation cylinder (3) and the precompression 
piston (2) as a follower, that the precompression double 

pistons (1, 2) form a gas-tight seal with the rounded part 
of the cylinder bushing (18) in every position during one 

revolution.  
 
Multi-chamber rotary piston internal combustion engine 
according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 

in the compression chamber (19) the compression piston 
(11) endcompresses the precompressed mixture into the directly 

adjacent ignition chamber (29) during its movement 
to the bottom dead center, and that the compression piston 

(11) forms a completely gas-tight seal of the compression 
chamber (19) towards the ignition chamber (29) and towards 

the rotation piston (1), and thus towards the precompression 
chamber (18a, b) in its bottom dead center position. 
Multi-chamber rotary piston internal combustion engine 
according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 

in a subsequent cylinder bushing (38), two rotation control 
pistons (24, 25) form the compression and ignition chamber 

(29) between them, into which the gas mixture is end-compressed 
by the compression piston (11), that the control 

pistons (24, 25) can be controlled by means of a control 
mechanism, with rotation symmetry, in such a way that when 

the control pistons (24, 25) continue to turn, the ignition 
chamber (29) opens up into the expansion chamber (30a) 

by means of this control mechanism, and thus allows the 
exploding gas mixture to exert working pressure on the 

pivot piston (23) and the expansion rotation cylinder (22) 
in the expansion chamber (30a). 
Multi-chamber rotary piston internal combustion engine 
according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 

the expansion rotation cylinder (22) and sitting on this, 
the pivot piston (23) rotate around a screw housing (26), 

that this screw housing (26) surrounds the ignition chamber 
(29) between the engine housing wall (20) with the two 

control pistons (24, 25) as well as the exhaust chamber  
 

(27) located on the inside, that the pivot piston (23) 
glides over the semicircular surface profiles of the screw 

housing (26) with its sliding block (34), forming a gas 
tight seal, driven forward by the expanding combustion 

gases, that this gas-tight gliding over the two semicircular 
surface profiles of the screw housing (26) is supported 

by the guide sliding block (32) and the tilting sliding 
block (34), with the guide sliding block being guided on 

the guide wall (42) and the guide stub (33) being guided

sliding block (34) are supported by tension springs in 

the pivot piston axle (35) and in the tilting sliding block

pivot piston (23) simultaneously ventilates with its end 
face the exhaust gases still present in the cylinder space 

(30b) from the previous expansion process via the exhaust 
openings (28) to the exhaust chamber (27) in the interior 

of the screw housing (26) and from there through the exhaust 
pipe (54). 
Multi-chamber rotary piston internal combustion engine 
according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that 

an outside gear crown (39) on the expansion rotation cylinder 
(22) transfers the torque generated during the work 

cycle to the central gear wheel shaft (52) via gear wheels
