<ABSTRACT>
In the production of native, intravenously administrable, stabilised immunoglobin (IgG) there is at least one extraction step using an aqueous extraction agent which, besides water, contains 38 to 42 vol % methanol and has a pH of 4.7 to 5.3. The raw material is a total globulin deposit containing less than 1 wt % polymers and the residual solvent of which, besides water, contains 35 to 40 vol % methanol and has a pH of 6.5 to 7.0. A total globulin deposit containing another residual solvent is rinsed with a corresponding methanol/water mixture. In every case, the total globulin deposit adjusted to the determined residual solvent is extracted at a temperature of 2 to 8  DEG C using an extracting agent containing 38 to 42 vol % methanol. Here, a pH of 4.7 to 5.3 and a methanol concentration of 38 to 42 vol % is maintained in the methanol/water mixture. The extract obtained is clarified and then finely cleaned and further processed into an applicable preparation.

containing total globulin precipitate comprising less than 1 %

by weight polymer from serum, plasma or placental sources;
b) treating said total globulin precipitate with an ionically weak
aqueous, alcoholic solution at a weak acidic pH, in order to

obtain an IgG solution;
c) removing from the thus obtained IgG solution the alcoholic solvent
and adjusting the thus obtained IgG solution to each a

selected protein concentration, an isotonic salt concentration
and a physiologically applicable pH value and

further processing the thus obtained and adjusted IgG solution
