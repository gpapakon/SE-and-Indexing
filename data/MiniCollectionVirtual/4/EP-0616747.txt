<DESCRIPTION>
 IMAGE DIGITIZER INCLUDING PIXEL ENGINEBackground of the Invention This invention relates to hardware designs coupled with software-based algorithms for capture, compression, decompression, and playback of digital image sequences, particularly in an editing environ ment.The idea of taking motion video, digitizing it, compressing the digital datastream, and storing it on some kind of media for later playback is not new. RCA's Sarnoff labs began working on this in the early days of the video disk, seeking to create a digital rather than an analog approach. This technology has since become known as Digital Video Interactive (DVI). Another group, led by Phillips in Europe, has also worked on a digital motion video approach for a product they call CDI (Compact Disk Interactive). Both DVI and CDI seek to store motion video and sound on CD-ROM disks for playback in low cost players. In the case of DVI, the compression is done in batch mode, and takes a long time, but the playback hardware is low cost. CDI is less specific about the compression approach, and mainly provides a format for the data to be stored on the disk.A few years ago, a standards-making body known as CCITT, based in France, working in conjunction with ISO, the International Standards Organization, created a working group to focus on image compression. This group, called the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) met for many years to determine the most effective way to compress digital images. They evaluated a wide range of compression schemes, including vector quantization (the technique used by DVI) and DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform). After exhaustive qualitative tests and careful study, the-JPEG group picked the DCT approach, and also defined in detail the various ways this approach could be used for image compression. The 

 group published a proposed ISO standard that is generally referred to as the JPEG standard. This standard is now in its final form, and is awaiting ratification by ISO, which is expected.The JPEG standard has wide implications for image capture and storage, image transmission, and image playback. A color photograph can be compressed by 10 to 1 with virtually no visible loss of quality. Compression of 30 to 1 can be achieved with loss that is so minimal that most people cannot see the difference. Compression factors of 100 to 1 and more can be achieved while niaintaining image quality acceptable for a wide range of purposes.The creation of the JPEG standard has spurred a variety of important hardware developments.

<CLAIMS>
 1. Image digitizer comprising: analog to digital and digital to analog converters; video memory for storing pixel data connected to the analog to digital and digital to analog converters; a processor connected to the analog to digital and digital to analog converters; a pixel engine connected to both the video memory and the processor: and a FIFO interface wherein the pixel engine is configured to enable pixels to be transferred out of memory or read into memory while bypassing the processor thereby allowing more efficient transfer of data into and out of the image digitizer.
2. The digitizer of claim 1 further including a pixel expander/compressor connected to the FIFO interface.
3. The image digitizer of claim 1 wherein memory space of the processor is divided into four regions.
4. The digitizer of claim 1 wherein the processor is programmed to subsample pixels.
