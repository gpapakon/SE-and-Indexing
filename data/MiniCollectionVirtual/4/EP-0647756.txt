<ABSTRACT>
The hinge (100) for doors, windows and the like comprises two hinge parts (10, 20) which can be pivoted with respect to one another about a vertical hinge pin in the manner of an articulation. A fastening part (4) on at least one of the hinge parts (10, 20) can be fastened on the corresponding fastening surface (3) by means of fastening screws (15) which pass through from the front and are designed as cap screws which can be actuated from the front. A covering (12) for that region of the fastening part (4) which contains the fastening screws (15) can be introduced at the two mutually opposite ends, under undercut protrusions (17, 18) of the hinge part (10). The covering (12) can be fixed by a spring-loaded pin (30) which can be displaced in its axis direction and, after the introduction of the covering (12) under the protrusions (17, 18), snaps into a bore (24), in a locking position, under its spring action.

Hinge (100) for door, windows and the like, 

with a hinge member (10) for attachment to a front attachment face 
(3) of the fixed frame (1), 
with a hinge member (20) for attachment to a front attachment face 
of the door or window, 
with a vertical hinge pin passing through a hinge eye portion (6) of 
both hinge components (10, 20) in order to make the two hinge 

components (10, 20) pivot with respect to one another, 
with an attachment part (4) on at least one of the hinge components 
(10, 20), which is designed with a rear engaging surface (5) for 

engagement against the corresponding attachment surface (3) and is 
attachable thereupon by means of attachment screws (15) formed as 

headed screws passing through it from the front and actuated from the 
front, 
and with a covering (12) overlying the region of the attachment 
member (4) containing the attachment screws (15) and capable of insertion 

at opposite ends under under-cut projections (17, 18) of the stated one 
hinge component (10), 
 
   characterised in that 


the covering can be secured in this position by locating means 
that the locating means comprise a spring-loaded pin (30) arranged 
in the attachment part (4) or the covering (12), covered over from the 

front and displaceable in the direction of its axis under spring-loading, the 
pin snapping into a locking position in a bore (24) of the other part, i.e. 

the covering (12) or the attachment member (4) under the spring-loading 
after the insertion of the covering (12) under the projections (17, 18). 
Hinge according to claim 1, characterised in that the pin (30) 

is arranged in a blind bore (37) in the covering (12) open towards the 
attachment member (4). 
Hinge according to claim 2, characterised in that the pin (30) 
is capable of being pushed back out of its locking position against the 

action of the spring from a position that cannot be reached when the door 
or window is closed, in order to release the covering (12). 
Hinge according to claim 3, characterised in that the hinge 
part (6) leaves at its rear face a spacing (8) perpendicular to the 

attachment surface (3) and a bore (26) leading to a point beneath the tip 
(28) of the pin (30) opens into the space which is left, to allow the 

insertion of a tool (50) for pushing back the pin (30). 
Hinge according to claim 3, or 4, characterised in that the 
pin (30) has a conical tip (28). 
Hinge according to one of claims 1 to 5,
 
   characterised in that, 


the pin (30) is arranged between attachment screws (15) provided 
vertically one above the other 
and that a spectacle-like guide member (40) of plastics is arranged 
in a corresponding recess (36) in the covering (12) with its side portions 

(33, 33) embracing in a fork-like manner the mutually adjacent screw 
heads (16) and the pin (30) engaged in its middle portion (39).
