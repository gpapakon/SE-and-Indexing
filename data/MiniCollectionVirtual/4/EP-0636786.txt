<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a movable pinion (6) 
and a control electromagnet (3), a transmission 

comprising a rocker arm (8) being interposed 
between the core (10) of the electromagnet (3) and 

the pinion (6). In the portion in question of the 
drive appendage (15) turned towards the core (10), 

this arm (8) has a profile which is substantially 
perpendicular to the axis of translation of the 

core (10). The rocker arm (8) is produced by two 
coupled metal sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
starter device for an internal combustion engine 
for a motor vehicle. More specifically, the invention relates 
to a starter device of the type comprising: 
a movable pinion which can mesh with a toothed 
wheel of the internal combustion engine; a control electromagnet comprising a core which 
can move between a rest position and an actuation 
position and has an end drive appendage; a transmission between the core of the 
electromagnet and the pinion, the transmission 
comprising a rocker arm of which the first end is 
coupled to a movable member controlling the 
translation of the pinion and a second end coupled 
with clearance to the appendage of the core of the 
electromagnet, such that, when the electromagnet 
is excited, the core leaves the rest position and 
travels through an initial dead stroke before the 
appendage causes the arm to pivot; and an electric motor which can be supplied so as to 
cause the pinion to rotate when the movable core 
of the electromagnet, having reached the actuation 
position, closes an electric switch. The transmission between the core of the 
electromagnet and the pinion is generally of non-rigid 
type. Actually the rocker arm is coupled 
with clearance to the drive appendage of the 
electromagnet. This clearance is provided so as to 
allow the movable core (which is in the actuation 
position ( with excited electromagnet)), when 
the electromagnet is de-energised, to travel over 
part of a stroke returning it to the rest position 
in which it is free from the thrust of the arm, 
such that the switch opens reliably and the motor 
is not supplied. As stated above, the transmission between 
the core of the electromagnet and the pinion is 
not rigid and may comprise one or more springs, 
provided, for example, so as to facilitate the 
meshing of the pinion and the toothed rim of the 
combustion engine if it is sticks at the front. 
Further, the rocker arm itself is frequently 
resiliently flexible. Because of the clearance in the rest 
position between the drive appendage of the 
electromagnet core and the rocker arm and to the 
fact that the transmission as a whole is not of 
rigid type, the movement of the pinion is not 
exactly proportional to that of the core.  
 
Therefore, when the core reaches the actuation 
position and the electric motor is supplied, it is 
not always ensured that the pinion meshes 
sufficiently with the toothed rim of the combustion 
engine. In order to overcome this disadvantage,

<CLAIMS>
A starter device for an internal 
combustion engine for a motor vehicle, comprising: 


a movable pinion (6) which can mesh with a toothed 
rim (7) of the internal combustion engine; 
a control electromagnet (3) comprising a core 
(10) which can move between a rest position and an 

actuation position and comprises an end drive 
appendage (15); 
a transmission (8, 5) between the core (10) of 
the electromagnet (3) and the pinion (6); the 

transmission comprising a rocker arm (8) having a 
first end (8a) coupled to a movable member (5) 

which controls the translation of the pinion (6) 
and a second end (8b) coupled with clearance to 

the drive appendage (15) of the core (10) of the 
electromagnet, such that, when the electromagnet 

(3) is excited, the core (10) leaves the rest 
position and travels through an initial dead 

travel before this appendage (15) causes the arm 
(8) to pivot; and 
an electric motor (2) which can be supplied so 
as to cause the pinion (6) to rotate when the 

movable core (10) of the electromagnet (3), having 
reached the actuation position, closes an electric 

switch;  
 
the rocker arm (8) having a shaped profile such 
that the initial dead travel is less than it would 

be with an arm having a substantially straight 
profile, all other geometric conditions being 

equal; 
 
characterized in that the second end (8b) of the 

rocker arm (8) has a profile, in correspondence 
with the drive appendage (15) of the core (10) of 

the electromagnet (3), having a development which 
is substantially perpendicular to the axis of 

translation of the core (10) when the core (10) is 
in the rest position. 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the profile which engages 

the drive appendage (15) and is turned towards the 
core (10) is substantially concave. 
A device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that the rocker arm (8) comprises 

two metal sheets, a first sheet being 
turned towards the drive appendage (15) and 

deflected, in correspondence with the second end 
(8b), towards the latter, and a second sheet 

turned towards the core (10) and having a profile 
which is substantially concave towards the core 

(10).
