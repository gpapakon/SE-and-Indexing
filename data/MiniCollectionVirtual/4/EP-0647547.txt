<ABSTRACT>
A guard (10) for use in a production vehicle such as an 
estate car comprises a barrier (12) and two mounting 

members (14). Each mounting member (14) is mounted on a 
rear seat belt mounting and is secured by a screw 

which replaces an existing trim member screw. The 
mounting members (14) mount the barrier (12) between them 

pivotally such that the barrier (12) is movable between 
a storage position alongside the ceiling (26) of the car 

and a use position in which it extends between the 
ceiling (26) of the car and the top of the rear seats 

(28) 
According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a 
guard (10) for use in a vehicle, the guard comprising a barrier (12) in 

the form of a perforated web, a portion of the web being interrupted by 
a transparent magnifying element (60). The transparant magnifying 

element will enable the driver of the vehicle to have a complete 
uninterrupted field of view through the magnifying element in spite of 

the presence of the barrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a guard for use in a vehicle. An example of a guard for use in a vehicle is a dog 
guard for use in a car. In many known dog guards for 
use in cars, the guard is fixed in place by fixings 
such as friction pads which are movable outwardly from 
the guard to frictionally engage the interior of the 
car. This may, however, lead to confusion on the part 
of the user as to precisely where on their particular 
car the guard should be located and where the fixing 
should engage for the guard to be safely held in 
position. Also, it may be desired to store the guard 
in the vehicle when it is not in use and the shape and 
size of the guard may make that difficult. According to one aspect of the invention there is 
provided a guard for use in a production vehicle, the 
guard comprising a barrier and mounting means, the 
mounting means being arranged to mount the barrier on 
at least one existing element of a vehicle such that 
the barrier is movable between a storage position 
alongside an interior surface of the vehicle and a use 
position. In this way, the barrier is mounted on at least one  
 
existing element of the vehicle so there is no 
confusion over where or how the guard should be 
mounted. Indeed, as the barrier is movable to a 
storage position the barrier may be permanently 
mounted in the vehicle and indeed may be supplied prefitted 
as a standard equipment option when the vehicle 
is sold. As the barrier is stored alongside an 
interior surface of the vehicle it is conveniently out 
of the way. According to another aspect of the invention there is 
provided a guard for use in a production vehicle, the 
guard comprising a barrier and mounting means, the 
mounting means being arranged to mount the barrier on 
at least one existing element of a vehicle such that 
the barrier is movable between a storage position in 
which it is substantially parallel to the axis of the 
vehicle, and a use position. By arranging the barrier in this way in the storage 
position, it will be edge-on to a driver looking 
through the vehicle and therefore will not obstruct 
his vision to any significant extent. In the storage position the barrier preferably lies 
alongside an interior surface of the vehicle.  The barrier may conveniently be substantially 
horizontal in the storage position. The said interior surface of the vehicle is preferably 
the ceiling of the vehicle. The space adjacent the 
ceiling of the vehicle is unlikely to be used for 
other purposes and the presence of the barrier in
