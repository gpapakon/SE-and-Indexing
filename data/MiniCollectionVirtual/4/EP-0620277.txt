<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production and use of a novel 
pharmaceutical product: a nucleic acid which, when directly introduced 
into living vertebrate tissue, induces the production of immune 
responses which specifically recognize human influenza virus. Influenza is an acute febrile illness caused by infection of 
the respiratory tract with influenza A or B virus. Outbreaks of 
influenza occur worldwide nearly every year with periodic epidemics 
or pandemics. Influenza can cause significant systemic symptoms, 
severe illness (such as viral pneumonia) requiring hospitalization, and 
complications such as secondary bacterial pneumonia. Recent U.S. 
epidemics are thought to have resulted in >10,000 (up to 40,000) excess 
deaths per year and 5,000-10,000 deaths per year in non-epidemic 
years. The best strategy for prevention of the morbidity and mortality 
associated with influenza is vaccination. The current licensed vaccines 
are derived from virus grown in eggs, then inactivated, and include 
three virus strains (two A strains and one B strain). Three types of 
vaccines are available: whole-virus, subvirion, and purified surface 
antigen. Only the latter two are used in children because of increased 
febrile responses with the whole-virus vaccine. Children under the age 
of 9 require two immunizations, while adults require only a single 
injection. However, it has been suggested [see Medical Letter32:89-90,  
 
Sept. 17, 1993] that "patients vaccinated early in the autumn might 
benefit from a second dose in the winter or early spring," due to the 
observations that in some elderly patients, the antibody titers following 
vaccination may decline to less-than-protective levels within four 
months or less. These vaccines are reformulated every year by 
predicting which recent viral strains will clinically circulate and 
evaluating which new virulent strain is expected to be predominant in 
the coming flu season. Revaccination is recommended annually. 1) Antigenic variation, particularly in A strains of influenza, results in 
viruses that are not neutralized by antibodies generated by a previous 
vaccine (or previous infection). New strains arise by point mutations 
(antigenic drift) and by reassortment (antigenic shift) of the genes 
encoding the surface glycoproteins (hemagglutinin [HA] and 
neuraminidase), while the internal proteins are highly conserved among 
drifted and shifted strains. Immunization elicits "homologous" strain-specific 
antibody-mediated immunity, not "heterologous"
