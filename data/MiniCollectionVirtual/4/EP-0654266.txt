<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel use of an 
isoquinolinesulfonamide derivative. More particularly, 
the present invention is concerned with a cardio-protective 
agent comprising, as an active ingredient, a 
specific isoquinolinesulfonamide derivative or an acid 
addition salt thereof. In the present invention, the term "cardio-protective 
agent" is intended to mean an agent which is 
effective for protecting a heart, specifically, and 
more particularly effective for prophylaxis and treatment 
of a myocardial disease and/or myocardial cell 
injury. Myocardial diseases and/or myocardial cell 
injury, which is caused by the influence of, for example, 
ischemia, ischemia/reperfusion or open heart 
surgery, finally results in the necrosis of myocardial 
cells. When the cardio-protective agent of the present 
invention is administered to a patient suffering from a 
myocardial disease and/or myocardial cell injury, the 
agent directly acts on the myocardial cells of the  
 
patient to prevent the necrosis of the myocardial 
cells. Accordingly, the cardio-protective agent of the 
present invention can be effectively used for prophylaxis 
and treatment of not only myocardial diseases, 
such as myocardial infarction and complications of 
myocardial infarction (e.g., shock, arrhythmia and 
heart failure, which accompany myocardial infarction), 
but also myocardial cell injury which is caused by 
ischemia/reperfusion in the treatment of myocardial 
infarction, such as thrombolytic therapy, percutaneous 
transluminal coronary angioplasty or the like, or which 
is caused by an arterial blocking or a sudden change in 
hemodynamics during or after open heart surgery. Heretofore, agents exhibiting cardio-protective 
activity have not yet been known which can be comprehensively, 
effectively used for prophylaxis and treatment 
of not only myocardial diseases, such as myocardial 
infarction and complications of myocardial infarction, 
but also myocardial cell injury which is caused 
by ischemia/reperfusion, open heart surgery or the 
like. As conventional agents for the prophylaxis and 
treatment of myocardial diseases, such as myocardial 
infarction and complications of myocardial infarction  
 
(e.g., shock, arrhythmia and heart failure, which 
accompany myocardial infarction), there can be mentioned, 
for example, a nitrate-type agent having a 
vasodilative effect, such as nitroglycerin; a calcium 
channel blocker having a vasodilative effect, such as 
nifedipine, verapamil or diltiazem; and a β-blocker, 
such
