<ABSTRACT>
A dampening water circulation system achieves further lightweighting, easy 
maintenance and decreases a heat energy influencing the temperature of the dampening 

water. There are provide a dampening water supply pipe 50 and the dampening water 
pool bar 60 along the water fountain roller 20. The dampening water pool bar and the 

water fountain roller are arranged to maintain an aperture G of several mm to thereby 
form the water pool portion 70 between two members. The fed water can be kept in the 

dampening water pool portion to be applied on the water fountain roller. The dampening 
water pool portion is made small in size to minimize a time for the dampening water from 

the supply pipe 50 to the water fountain roller whereat the supplied water does not 
influenced by any foreign element, which can minimize the return water amount and is 

effective to decrease the cooling capacity for the used dampening water.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is broadly concerned with a dampening water circulation system
used in an offset press and intended particularly to be used to a dampening water
circulation system which minimizes foreign elements for the dampening water and forms
uniformed water screen on form plates preferably with small water.There are some known conventional dampening water circulation systems for the
general offset press, for examples, a system wherein a ductor is adapted to intermittently
contact with a water fountain roller constantly dipped in water stored in a water fountain,
a system wherein a damping roller is constantly rotatably contacted with the water
fountain roller, a system wherein the dampening water is fed to the damping roller by
rotatably contacting a rotary brush with the water fountain roller in a state there is a gap of
rotational speeds between them, and a system wherein the dampening water is sprayed
over the water fountain roller.One of the conventional dampening water circulation systems will be explained
in detail with reference to Fig. 21. The dampening water circulation system is essentially
consisting of a dampening roller apparatus 2 to transmit the dampening water to form
plates 1 of an offset press (hereinafter referred to as "press") and a dampening water
circulating device 3 to control the dampening water fed to the dampening roller apparatus
2. The dampening roller apparatus 2 has a water fountain roller 20 finished thereon with
chromium coating to have hydrophilic nature, a rubber roller 22 and a chromium roller 24
in a contacting state to each other in this order. The chromium roller 24 is arranged to
contact with a rubber damping roller 26 whereat these serial rollers are relatively rotated
to transmit the dampening water to the form plate 1. The dampening water circulating
device 3 is provided to store therein a predetermined amount of dampening water
constantly for the water fountain roller and further control amount, temperature and
quality of the dampening water returned from a water fountain 30.Such dampening water circulation system has already taught in the Japanese Utility
Model Application Publication No. Hei 4-43321.Fig. 22 is a schematical view depicting a spray type, wherein a spray nozzle 40 is
disposed to oppose to a chromium roller 24 contacting with the dampening roller 26 to
thereby spray the dampening water fed from a dampening water supply 4 by means of a 
spray nozzle 40.As has been mentioned above, in such conventional system, the water fountain
roller is
