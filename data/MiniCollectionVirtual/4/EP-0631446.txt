<ABSTRACT>
A first reproduced color under signal is delayed 
by one or two horizontal periods by a delay circuit, 

and this delayed second reproduced color under signal 
and the aforementioned first reproduced color under 

signal have their frequencies converted individually 
by first and second frequency converters into standard 

color signals. An oscillatory frequency signals of 2n 
of carriers for the aforementioned frequency conversions 

are divided to have the aforementioned carrier 
frequencies and to produce four carriers having phases 

of 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees. These carriers are 
selectively fed to the first and second frequency converters 

by switches so that the two frequency-converted 
signals are subtracted or added in phase or in opposite 

phase to clear the noise (or crosstalk component), 
which is caused by the crosstalk between the 

tracks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal processor
for a VTR (which is abbreviated from Video Tape
Recorder as in the following) and, more particularly,
to a technique which is effective if applied to a frequency
converter for converting the reproduced video
signals of a color under system such as the VHS, S-VHS
or 8 mm video system into standard color signals.In the home VTR, color video signals are recorded
by the color under system. In this system, the luminance
signals are frequency-modulated, and the color
signals are frequency-converted to a lower frequency
band than that of the frequency-modulated luminance
signals and are recorded on the inclined track of a
magnetic tape by a rotary video head.The VTR of recent years uses the guard bandless
system for a higher density and is essentially required
to clear a noise (as will be called the "crosstalk
component") caused by a crosstalk. The clearance 
of this crosstalk component is effected by giving an
azimuth angle to the video head, and this azimuth
angle is effective highly for high-frequency signals
but lowly for low-frequency signals. In other words,
the clearance of the crosstalk component is little effective
for the color signals, and the phase shift
system (i.e., the PS system) or the phase invert system
(i.e., the PI system) is adopted for the effect.A method of clearing the crosstalk component in
the color under system will be described by using the
NTSC format of the VHS system. The video recording
track is recorded by alternating two tracks, i.e.,
Channel 1 and Channel 2. In the NTSC format of the
VHS system, the color under frequency is set to forty
times (40 fH) as high as the horizontal scanning frequency
fH (fH = 15.734 KHz). As a result, the standard
color signals are recorded by converting their
sub-carrier frequency of 3.579545 MHz into 40 fH,
i.e., about 629 KHz. At this time, the phases are advanced
for one horizontal period (1 H) by 90 degrees
in Channel 1 and delayed by 90 degrees in Channel 2.
This is because when the reproduced color under signal
of 629 KHz is inversely converted at a playing time to
3.579545 MHz (while the phases are also returned), the
reproduced color under signals delayed by one horizontal 
period (1 H) can be added to clear the crosstalk
components by using a delay element of one horizontal
period (1 H) and by using the reproduced color under
signals before delayed and the delay element.The frequency conversion technique we have investigated
before our invention is shown in Fig. 12, Fig.
13 and Fig. 14.
