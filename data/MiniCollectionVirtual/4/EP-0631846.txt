<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for mounting to a tool (105) having a surface (20) 
to be 

cleaned for producing aerosol from a substance for cleaning 
the surface (20), includes a flang
e (130) for mounting to the 
tool (105) having the surface (20) to be cleaned. A nozzle (102) is 

mounted 
to the flange (130) for receiving the substance. The nozzle (102) 

has at least one exit opening (165) which allows passing of the 
substance therethrough for expanding the substance from a 

first pressure to a second pressure which is lower than 
the first pressure for solidifying at least a substantial 

portion of the substance and producing aerosol for cleaning 
the surface (20). Condensation preventing means (115,125) is provided 

for preventing condensation from forming on surfaces (45) of 
the apparatus and the surface (20) to be cleaned, and contamination 

preventing means (115) is provided for preventing contaminants 
from re-contaminating the surface (20) subsequent to 

removal therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to production of
cryogenic aerosol and, more particularly, to surface
cleaning using a cryogenic aerosol.Surface contamination is a widespread concern in many
industries. Such contamination can result in production
of inferior or non-operating products, or considerably
lower product yields. For instance, as a specific example,
surface contamination is a prevalent problem in the
microelectronics processing industry, and can take the
form of unwanted particles, films, molecules, or the like;
and the surfaces that can be contaminated include those of
semiconductor wafers, displays, microelectronic components,
etc. Contamination of these surfaces can cause
various types of defects to develop, including short circuits,
open circuits, stacking faults, among others. These
defects can adversely affect circuits, and ultimately
cause entire chips to fail.Another type of surface that has contaminants that are
required to be removed are the walls of tool or processing
chambers, such as plasma etch and chemical vapor deposition
reactors. Reaction residues and/or polymers generated
during semiconductor processing tend to deposit on the
chamber walls. These residues and/or polymers can subsequently
flake off onto products being processed or onto
subsequently processed products. In order to prevent
yield loss due to this mechanism, manufacturing processing
chambers have to be disassembled periodically to be
cleaned or "wiped down". Current practice involves weekly
disassembly of the fixtures inside the chamber and wipe
down of all the surfaces with a mixture of alcohol and
water. This periodic machine disassembly, wipe down, and 
re-assembly, and the required long pump-down times after
cleaning for surface drying, severely reduces the production
and reliability of the processing equipment. In addition,
the acidic fumes formed when the deposited material
reacts with water often creates a health hazard for cleaning
personnel.U.S. Patent No. 5,108,512, issued April 28, 1992, to
Goffnett et al., relates to cleaning a chemical vapor
deposition reactor used in the production of
polycrystalline silicon by impacting with carbon dioxide
pellets. Goffnett et al. discloses delivering carbon
dioxide gas to a pelletizer where the gas is compressed
and formed into solid carbon dioxide pellets. The pellets,
along with an accelerant gas for increasing the
velocity of the pellets, are delivered to a nozzle. The
nozzle is a "venturi" nozzle which maximizes the velocity
at which the pellets are
