<ABSTRACT>
Two cereal extracts are produced by means of a process comprising the steps of milling cereal material, suspending the milled material in an aqueous liquid, treating the suspension with an alkali, acidifying and separating the solid and liquid in the resulting mixture. The liquid and solid may be further purified and are useful as ingredients in comestible products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing cereal extracts.The use of corn bran extracts as bulking agents in food products is
well-known. US 4927654 discloses a process for producing
hemicellulose extracts from delignified plant fibers, such as corn bran, by
extracting the plant fibers with sodium hydroxide solution and acidifying
the resulting mixture to precipitate a first hemicellulose fraction. A
second hemicellulose fraction is precipitated from the resulting filtrate by
the addition of ethanol.The present invention provides a process for producing a novel extract
from cereal-derived material.A cellulose-containing extract may be obtained by the following
process. The extract may be produced as an insoluble bleached cellulose
residue of alkaline extracted cereal material (e.g., cell walls of maize bran)
and may contain other insoluble biopolymers besides cellulose.Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for producing a
cellulose-containing cereal extract comprising the steps of:
(i) milling cereal material;(ii) suspending the milled cereal material in an aqueous liquid;(iii) treating the resulting suspension with an alkali;(iv) lowering the pH of the treated suspension to from 5 to 7;(v) separating the solids and the liquid in the resulting mixture;(vi) resuspending the separated solids in an aqueous liquid;(vii) raising the pH of the resulting suspension to from 12 to 13;(viii) treating the mixture with hydrogen peroxide at an elevated
temperature;(ix) lowering the pH of the mixture to below 7;(x) separating the solids from the mixture;(xi) washing the treated solids; and(xii) drying the washed solids.The cereal material is preferably milled (either in wet or dry form) to a
particle size of from 50 to 250 µm e.g., 80 to 180 µm. The aqueous
liquid in which the milled cereal material is suspended is preferably water
but may also be a solution or a suspension of other substances in water
provided that this does not adversely interfere with the subsequent steps
in the process. The suspension preferably contains from 5 to 10% (e.g.,
8%) dry weight/volume of milled corn bran and may be formed at ambient
temperature.The cereal material is preferably cereal husk or bran and may be
obtained from cereals such as maize, corn, barley, wheat, rice or oats, or
malt or malt culms. Preferably the cereal material is corn bran. The
milled material may be air classified or sieved to remove starch and the
starch removal process may comprise starch removal by suitable enzyme
treatment, for
