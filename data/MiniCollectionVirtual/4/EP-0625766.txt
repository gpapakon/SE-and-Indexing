<ABSTRACT>
An object to be checked contains a large number of
magnetic polymer elements (12) scattered at random.

Each of magnetic polymer elements (12) is made up of
an element main body (13) formed of a high molecular

material, and magnetic metal powder (14) contained in
the element main body (13). The magnetic polymer

elements (12) are integrally incorporated in paper and
tangled with the wood pulp fibers of the paper three-dimensionally.

In the manufacturing process of the
object, a processing apparatus magnetically scans the

magnetic polymer elements (12) incorporated in the
scanning region of the object while moving the scanning

region at a predetermined speed, converts a detection
signal obtained by the magnetic scan into a cipher code,

and records the cipher code in a code indicator section.
In the authenticity checking process, the processing

apparatus magnetically scans the magnetic polymer elements
(12) once again, and a detection signal obtained

thereby is collated with the cipher code recorded in the
code indicator section. When the detection signal and

the cipher code agree with each other, the object is
determined as being authentic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to objects which
should be prevented from being forged and are to be
checked for authenticity, such as important documents,
securities, paper money, checks, traveler's checks, bank
cards, prepaid cards, ID cards, CD cards, credit cards,
passports, art objects, and betting tickets for public-managed
gambling games (e.g., horse racing and bicycle
racing). The present invention also relates to a method
and apparatus for checking the objects.A checking method and apparatus utilizing microwaves
are known in the art as measures for checking the
authenticity of documents or the like, as described in
PCT National Publication No. 63-501250 (i.e., U.S.
Patent No. 4,820,912). An object to be checked, wherein
stainless steel fibers are embedded and scattered in the
sign panel of a card base member, is also known in the
art, as described in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication
No. 5-270181.According to these publications, microwaves are
applied to a large number of metallic wires which are
embedded and scattered at random in a document or a
card, and a proper digital mark responsive to a response
microwave bundle is recorded in a suitable region of the
document or card according to specific rules. To check
the authenticity of the document or card, microwaves are 
applied to the document or card, and a response microwave
bundle is collated with the digital mark. The
document or card is determined as being authentic when
the microwave bundle and the mark agree with each
other.The checking means which utilizes microwaves, as in
the apparatuses of the above publications has problems
in that the measurement of a response microwave bundle
is susceptible to external noise, and the signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N ratio) is lowered thereby. In
addition, the apparatuses of the publications may
constitute a source of noise since they oscillate
microwaves. Further, a microwave transmitter and a
microwave receiver are generally large in size and
entail high costs.In the case where metallic wires are embedded in a
thin object, such as paper, it is likely that the metallic
wires will be exposed in the surface of the object.
If this happens, the object does not look nice. In
addition, the metallic wires prevent satisfactory printing
or coloring from being performed with respect to the
object, and may rust, depending upon the environment.
Further, if the object is bent, the metallic wires
embedded therein may break, protruding from the surface
of the object. In the worst case, the code which is
assigned to the
