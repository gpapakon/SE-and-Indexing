<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to a framing system which
incorporates both closed tubular frame members and open channel members
into a single versatile system.In the prior art, framing systems have typically used either
closed tubular members which have bolt holes for attachment to other
members, allowing incremental adjustment, or open channel members which
allow infinite adjustment within the channel for attachment of various
members. The prior art has not successfully incorporated closed tubular
members with open channel members. The prior art has also not been
successful in attaching open channel members to closed tubular members
or other supports, without the use of numerous attachment members.The CA-A-699696 discloses a coupling for connecting multifaceted
structural members, said coupling comprising a tubular
connecting member of polygonal cross section and at least two
open ends in said connecting member each adapted to receive said
structural member. Closed tubular members are advantageous in that they are
stronger than open channel members. Open channel members, however,
allow infinite adjustment of the position at which various members are
attached. Further, open channel members have typically not been used
with through bolt connections, which are used with closed tubular
members and provide a strong mount. Some open channel members may have
had some bolt openings to receive connection members. However, the
distance between the bolt openings on the open channel members and on
the closed tubular members has been different. Thus, the two types of
framing members have not been easily incorporated into a single system.
It would be desirable to gain the benefits of both types of framing
members. The present invention has developed a framing system which allows the
two types of framing members to be utilized in combination.The framing system according to the invention comprises: a
closed tubular member having a generally polygonal cross-section
with closed sides along the majority of its length
defining a bore, one of said closed sides including holes; an
open channel member received within said closed tubular member
and having a polygonal cross-section with closed sides along
the majority of its length and one open side along the majority
of its length defining a channel; and a securement member which
can be passed through one of the holes of the closed tubular
member into the channel of the open channel member via the open
side thereof to secure said open channel member to said closed
tubular member
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A framing system (20) comprising:

a closed tubular member (22) having a generally polygonal
cross-section with closed sides along the majority of its

length defining a bore (23), one of said closed sides including
holes (32) ;
an open channel member (26, 29) received within said
closed tubular member (22) and having a polygonal cross-section

with closed sides along the majority of its length and one open
side along the majority of its length defining a channel (28,

38) ; and
a securement member (36, 40) which can be passed through
one of the holes (32) of the closed tubular member (22) into

the channel (28, 38) of the open channel member (26, 29) via
the open side thereof to secure said open channel member (26,

29) to said closed tubular member (22) such that the position
of said open channel member (26, 29) within the bore (23) in

the closed tubular member (22) is infinitely adjustable.
A system as recited in claim 1, wherein said open channel
member (26) has holes (32) along one of its closed sides, and

said securement member (36, 40) can be passed through one of
the holes (32) of said closed tubular member (22) and one of

the holes (32) of said open channel member (26) to secure said
open channel member (26) to the closed tubular member such that

the position of said open channel member (26) within the bore
(23) in the closed tubular member (22) is incrementally

adjustable.
A system as recited in claim 1 or 2, wherein said closed
tubular member (22) and said open channel member (26, 29) are

rectangular in cross-section.
A system as recited in one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said
securement member is a rivet (78) having a pin (80) which

forces a number of ears (82) radially outwardly. 
A system as recited in one of claims 1 to 4, including an
additional closed tubular member (24), said additional closed

tubular member (24) also having a polygonal cross-section, with
the outer dimensions of said additional closed tubular member

(24) and said open channel member (26, 29) being less than the
inner dimensions of said closed tubular member (22) such that

said closed tubular member (22) may receive both said
additional closed tubular member (24) and said open channel

member (26, 29) within said bore (23) to provide a sleeve
connecting the two.
A system as recited in claim 5, wherein holes (32) are
formed along said closed sides of said additional closed

tubular member (24), and said additional closed tubular member
(24) is secured to said closed tubular member (22) by a

securement member (30) extending through one of the holes (32)
in the closed tubular member (22) into one of the holes (32) in

the additional closed tubular member (24).
A system as recited in claim 6, wherein the holes (32) in
said closed tubular member (22), said additional closed tubular

member (24) and said open channel member (26, 29) are spaced by
equal distances.
A system as recited in claims 1 to 7, including an
additional open channel member (26, 29), wherein said closed

tubular member (22) is connected at a 90° angle relative to
said additional open channel member (26, 29).
A system as recited in claim 8, wherein said additional open
channel member (26, 29) also has holes (32), said 90° angle

connection being provided by securing an elbow member (58) to
said closed tubular member (22) and to said additional open

channel member (26, 29) by passing bolts (40) through the holes
(32) in the closed tubular member (22) and the additional open

channel member (26, 29).
A system as recited in claim 8, wherein said 90° angle 
connection is provided by securing a 90° elbow (50) to said

closed tubular member (22) by passing a bolt (40) through one
of said holes (32) in the closed tubular member (22), and said

elbow (50) being secured to said additional open channel member
(26, 29) by passing a bolt (40) into the channel (28) thereof.
A system as recited in claim 8, wherein said 90° angle
connection includes members extending in each of four

directions spaced 90° from each other from a central cross
shaped connection member.
A system as recited in claim 11, wherein said cross shaped
member is secured to the closed tubular member (22), and also
