<ABSTRACT>
Bicycle tyre comprising a carcass of two steel wires (1) 
having canvas (2) wound thereon, and a tread (3) of rubber 

fitted onto the canvas. The tread (3) is composed of adjacent 
portions (4, 5) of rubber having different properties 

and extending in circumferential direction of the tyre. In 
particular if the tyre is provided with studs, the side 

portions (5) of the tread (3) will be manufactured from a 
harder type of rubber than the middle portion (4) of the 

tread. The softer type of rubber will have a hardness of 30 
to 55°sha and the harder type of rubber will have a hardness 

of 55 to 80°sha.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a bicycle tyre comprising a 
carcass of particularly two wires of steel or a similar 
material having canvas wound onto them, with a tread of 
rubber being attached to the canvas. A soft or a hard type of rubber must be selected as 
material for the tread of the tyre. A soft type of rubber 
has a better grip on a somewhat plane road, on which one 
will also often ride, but is less wear resistant. When the tyre is meant for riding across rough, slanting 
and irregular terrains and loose ground, the tyre will 
be provided with studs for obtaining a best possible grip of 
the tyre on the ground. This applies in particular to riding 
on loose ground, on irregularities or on riding across a 
slope and in bends. At such times, the side studs are loaded 
laterally. When the tread is manufactured of a soft type of rubber, 
on will obtain a good contact between the tyre and the 
road when riding across a substantially plane road. However, 
the studs will yield stronger and thus be less effective 
when riding across loose ground and the like as indicated 
above. This will also apply to the studs at the side of the 
tread, which in particular must perform their functions on 
riding across slopes. Up to now, with the manufacture of bicycle tyres one 
therefore has had to compromise in the selection of the type 
of rubber for the tread. The object of the invention is to design a bicycle tyre 
of the type described above in such a way, that it can 
optimally perform its functions. To that end, according to the invention it is provided 
for, that the tread is composed of adjacent portions extending 
in circumferential direction of the tyre and being of 
rubber having different properties. With bicycle tyres meant for riding across rough, 
slanting and irregular terrains, the adjacent portions of 
the tread will in particular be of rubber having different 
hardnesses. In particular, it will be provided for that the side  
 
portions of the tread are manufactured from a harder type of 
rubber than the middle portion of the tread. When riding across a slope in loose ground, the outer 
studs will then optimally perform their functions, since 
they will not or hardly yield. For a soft type of rubber, rubber having a hardness of 
30 to 60°sha is considered, and for a harder type of rubber, 
a hardness of 50 to 80°sha. Even if the bicycle tyre is not provided with studs, 
but is meant for a normal touring bicycle or a racing bicycle, 
applying the invention can give advantages. According to the
