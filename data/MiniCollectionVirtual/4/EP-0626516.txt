<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of a two-stage positive displacement pump (1) is, in particular, to cooperate with a turbomolecular drag pump (2) which can be connected upstream thereof. In the arrangement, the two-stage positive displacement pump (1) is designed, according to the invention, as a hybrid pump (3) which on the medium inlet side has a piston pump (5) with a comparatively large swept volume (piston-swept volume) (6), the piston-cylinder chamber (7) of said pump being sealed with respect to the crank chamber (8) by means of a sealing membrane (9). Another integral aspect of the inventive design of the two-stage positive displacement pump (1) is that in the hybrid pump (3) there is connected, downstream of the piston pump (5), a diaphragm pump (10) whose swept volume (11) is appreciably smaller compared to that of the piston pump (5).

A lubricant-free vacuum pump arrangement with a 
turbomolecular pump (2) downstream of which (2) in the 

flow route is a two-stage positive displacement pump 
(1) in the form of a hybrid pump (3), said two-stage 

positive displacement pump (1) having on the medium-entry 
side a reciprocating pump (5) which has a 

pendulum piston (18) and downstream of which (5) is a 
diaphragm pump (10) expelling the pumping medium, which 

reciprocating pump and diaphragm pump (5, 10) are 
driven by a common crankshaft (26), whereby the piston-cylinder 

space (7) is sealed off with respect to the 
crank area (8) by means of a sealing diaphragm (9) and 

whereby the intermediate space (30) provided between 
the piston (18) on the one hand and the sealing 

diaphragm (30) on the other hand is connected to an 
extraction line (33). 
A vacuum pump arrangement as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that in the direction of delivery flow 

the extraction line (33) ends ahead of a suction valve 
(27) of the reciprocating pump (5). 
A vacuum pump arrangement as claimed in claim 1 or 
claim 2, characterized in that the displacement area 

(11) of the diaphragm pump (10) is appreciably smaller 
in comparison to that of the reciprocating pump (5). 
A vacuum pump arrangement as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the displacement 

areas (6, 11) of the two positive displacement pumps 
(5, 10) are approximately matched to each other in such 

a way that, at a given operating vacuum, the 
reciprocating pump (5) has an expulsion volume which is  

 
at least approximately equal to the suction volume of 

the diaphragm pump (10). 
A vacuum pump arrangement as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the diaphragm pump 

(10) has a shaped diaphragm (22) whose front side (24) 
is adapted to the adjacent pumping area wall (23) of 

the diaphragm pump (10). 
A vacuum pump arrangement as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the intake port 

(12) of the reciprocating pump (5) is connected with 
the outlet (15) of the turbomolecular pump (2), that 

the turbomolecular pump (2) and the two positive 
displacement pumps (5, 10) are interconnected with 

respect to their housings (16, 17), and that a mass 
balance of all moved masses is provided, at least 

nearly, preferably with respect to the reciprocating 
pump and diaphragm pump (5, 10). 
A vacuum pump arrangement as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the reciprocating 

pump (5) has a piston head with a disk-like sealing 
collar which, upon insertion into the piston-cylinder 

space (7), takes on a U-shaped cross section. 
A vacuum pump arrangement as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the reciprocating 

pump (5) and the diaphragm pump (10) are arranged in 
the direction of a common pump longitudinal axis (L).
