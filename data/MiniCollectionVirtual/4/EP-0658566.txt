<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing polynucleotides on a solid support in a reactor in the form of a column through which the solutions of reagents and/or solvents are circulated, characterised in that the solid phase constituting the said solid support is immobilised in the said reactor, and the said solutions migrate in the column and through the solid phase according to a frontal progression, such that the successive solutions of each stage of a synthesis cycle do not or hardly mix. The subject of the present invention is also a reactor consisting of a column completely filled with particles of porous materials constituting the solid support, and a synthesis device including such a reactor.
