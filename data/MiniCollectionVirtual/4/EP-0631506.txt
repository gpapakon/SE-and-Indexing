<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are methods for selectively deglycosylating HIV-1 envelope protein which retain their ability to support viral infectivity. The deglycosylation is achieved by generating recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins which have primary amino acid sequence mutations in the N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences. Also disclosed are vaccines and antibodies to the mutant recombinant HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins.

 SELECTIVELY DEGLYCOSYLATED HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS TYPE 1 ENVELOPE VACCINESBackground of the Invention The field of the invention is human immunodeficiency virus vaccines and immunotherapeutics.The invention was supported by the U.S. Government which has certain rights in the invention.Human immunodeficiency virus is the etiological agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) . The env gene of HIV encodes a 160 kD glycoprotein that is subsequently cleaved into two smaller species, an extracellular (or surface) protein gpl20 and a transmembrane protein gp41 (Allan et al., 1985, Science 228:1091; Di'Marzo-Veronese et al., 1985, Science229:1402). Gpl20 is noncovalently linked to gp41 (Allan et al., 1985, Science 228:1091; Chou et al. , 1988, J. Infect. Dis. 157:805; Di'Marzo-Veronese et al., 1985, Science 229:1402; Lasky et al., 1987, Cell 50:975). Among the various HIV isolates, some sequences are highly conserved and some are variable. Two characteristics of the env glycoprotein are conservation of cysteine residues and of a relatively large number of N-linked carbohydrate sites in HIV-1 isolates. Similar secondary and tertiary structures for the env glycoprotein have been suggested based on the similarity of the sequences of HIV.The env glycoprotein is heavily glycosylated. The unmodified polypeptide backbone of gpl20 (about 480 amino acids) weighs about 55 kD. About one half of the molecular weight of gpl20 can be accounted for by attached carbohydrates (Allan et al. , 1985, Science 228:1091; Geyer et al., 1988, J. Biol. Chem. 263:11760; Matthews et al., 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 

84:5424; Mizuochi et al. , 1988, Biochem J. 254:599; Robey et al. , 1985, Science 228:593). Although gp41 is also a glycoprotein, it is not as heavily glycosylated as gpl20 (Di'Marzo-Veronese et al., 1985, Science 229:1402). The oligosaccharides of the gpl20/41 complex are generally N- linked with no detectable 0-linked sugar residues present ( ozarsky et al. , 1989, J. AIDS 2:163; Leonard et al. , 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265:10373). The consensus sequence of the site for N-linked carbohydrate attachment is Asn- X-Ser/Thr, where X is any amino acid except Pro and Asp. HIV-1 molecular clones contain an average of 23-24 potential N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites on gpl20 and about 4-7 on gp41. The consensus sites on gpl20 are generally glycosylated when the env protein is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Leonard et al. , 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265:10373).CD4 is the host cell receptor for
