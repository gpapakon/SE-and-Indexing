<ABSTRACT>
A composite structure comprising a substrate bearing a layer of release coating prepared from one or more epoxypolysiloxanes together providing cycloaliphatic epoxy group(s) and non-cycloaliphatic (i.e., linear or branched aliphatic) epoxy group(s). The resulting release coating cures quickly and exhibits low release levels to adhesive. An oligomeric epoxypolysiloxane comprising both cycloaliphatic and non-cycloaliphatic epoxy groups is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to composite 
structures comprising a layer of epoxypolysiloxane 
which is useful as release coatings for adhesive roll 
and sheet materials. This invention also relates to 
oligomeric epoxypolysiloxanes useful for preparing such 
composite structures. Coatings having specific release properties 
toward adhesives are widely used. Epoxypolysiloxanes 
have been found to provide useful release compositions 
as described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,279,719, 4,313,988 and 4,822,687. These patents 
disclose release compositions prepared from a variety 
of polysiloxanes containing either cycloaliphatic epoxy 
groups or linear or branched aliphatic epoxy groups. 
It has been found that use of a polysiloxane containing 
only cycloaliphatic epoxy groups provides a release 
composition often exhibiting higher than desired 
release values to adhesives. Even where a relatively 
high release value is desired, such may be difficult to 
attain using epoxypolysiloxanes containing only 
cycloaliphatic epoxy functionality, since the inclusion 
of cycloaliphatic epoxy functionality at greater than 
20% of the siloxane units in an epoxypolysiloxane 
generally leads to unacceptably high release values, 
and high cycloaliphatic epoxy functionality may result 
in compositions which gel uncontrollably before the 
release material can be coated onto the desired 
substrate. On the other hand, use of a polysiloxane 
containing only linear or branched aliphatic epoxy 
groups provides suitable release compositions 
exhibiting release values which can range from low  
 
values to relatively high values as desired depending 
on the content of the epoxy functionality. These 
compositions show other desirable properties as well 
such as improved coatability onto and anchorage to 
substrates. However, such epoxypolysiloxanes generally 
exhibit a cure rate slower than that exhibited by 
epoxypolysiloxanes containing only cycloaliphatic epoxy 
groups. This may render the manufacture of such 
release materials more expensive and less convenient. The present invention provides a novel 
composite structure comprising a substrate bearing on 
one or more surfaces a layer comprising the reaction 
product of a starting material comprising one or more 
epoxypolysiloxanes individually or together providing 
cycloaliphatic and non-cycloaliphatic epoxy groups in a 
total number which is about 5 to 50% of the total 
number of siloxane units, the ratio of total number of 
cycloaliphatic epoxy groups to total number of
