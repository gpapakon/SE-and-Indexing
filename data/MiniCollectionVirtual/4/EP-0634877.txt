<ABSTRACT>
Travelers can be reached via a cellular telephone call while at a remote 
location (160-1--160-N), by using a mobility system (110/130) containing a database 

record (120/140) for each traveler using the system. The record contains information 
indicating the traveler's itinerary, including the dates/times during which the traveler 

will be away from home, and an information field containing the "reach number" of 
a cellular telephone instrument to be provided to the traveler in each remote location. 

A temporary personal communication service (PCS) traveler profile is established 
for the traveler, and the PTN is given to the traveler for distribution to persons likely 

to call the traveler while he or she is away from home. The profile is arranged to 
include the reach numbers of the specific cellular telephone instruments that are to be 

provided to the traveler; the profile is made "active" only for the time period during 
which the traveler will have that telephone instrument. When a call is placed to the 

traveler (using the PTN) during a time period when the traveler is away from home, 
the PCS traveler profile is retrieved, and the call is completed to the cellular 

telephone number corresponding to the specific cellular telephone instrument that 
was provided to the traveler. Optionally, callers who use the PTN to reach the 

traveler are interrupted by a prompting device that apprises the callers of the fact that 
the traveler is away from home, and permits them to hang up or leave a message (in 

105) for the traveler.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a system and method for 
communicating with travelers and, in particular, to a system that allows (wireless 
cellular or personal mobile) telephone calls to be completed to a person while 
traveling, such as in a service area in a foreign country or territory that has 
incompatible wireless systems. Increased mobility and the ability to communicate with a subscriber, 
anytime, anywhere, is the overarching goal of many new telecommunications 
services. One such service is known as the EasyReachSM service, now being offered 
by AT&T. With EasyReach service, a telephone subscriber is given a special, 
personal telephone number (PTN), and calls placed to that number are routed by the 
telecommunications carrier to a "reach number" listed in a database. The database is 
arranged to store easily updatable profiles, which specify which reach numbers shall 
be used and at what times, to complete calls to each subscriber. Thus, if the 
subscriber is at the office during business hours, calls can be routed there between 
say 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. At other times, the calls can be routed to the 
subscriber's home telephone. If needed, due to a special circumstance such as a 
schedule change, holiday or a sick day, profile updates can be entered in the database 
by the subscriber. In addition, the subscriber can route calls to a cellular telephone 
during the trip to and from the office. Also, a subscriber can route calls to a 
messaging system for later retrieval from his/her message "box". A description of 
EasyReach service is contained in patent application of Creswell et al, serial no. 
07/754,109, filed on September 3, 1991, and continuing application 07/905,265, filed 
on June 26, 1992, and assigned to the same assignee as the present application. Another approach to communicating with travelers has been the 
improvement in the way calls to roaming cellular subscribers are completed. 
Normally, when a call is placed to a cellular subscriber, the call is routed by the 
wireline telecommunications carrier to the mobile telephone switching office 
(MTSO) serving the "home" service area for that subscriber. If the subscriber is in 
that area, the call can be completed. However, when the cellular subscriber is 
"roaming", i.e., traveling outside of his or her home territory, additional coordination 
between MTSO's is required. In one proposed system, coordination is accomplished 
when the roaming subscriber initiates a cellular call, and the call is received by the 
MTSO
