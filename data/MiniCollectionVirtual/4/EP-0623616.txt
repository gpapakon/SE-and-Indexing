<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new heterocyclic compounds, a 
process for the preparation thereof, pharmaceutical compositions 
comprising the same, to the use of the said heterocyclic 
compounds for the treatment of diseases and for the 
preparation of pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the 
treatment of diseases. According to an aspect of the present invention there 
are provided new heterocyclic compounds of general formula 
(I), 
wherein A stands for a group of formula -C≡C- or -CH=CH-, and 
pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition salts thereof. The European patent specification No.196,096 describes 
imide derivatives having antipsychotic activity, which are 
structurally similar to the compounds according to the invention. 
The latter compounds, however, exhibit a fully different 
effect, they have anxioselective properties devoid of 
any neuroleptic character. The Japanese Kokai Tokkyo Koho patent specification  
 
No.63-10,760 provides bicycloheptanes exhibiting tranquillant 
activity. The Japanese Kokai Tokkyo Koho patent specification 
No.63-10,760 describes N-(piperazinylbutyl)-imide derivatives 
exerting tranquillant and antipsychotic effects. The Hungarian patent specifications Nos 190,997 and 
195,806 relate to benzothiazole and benzoxazole derivatives 
having antipsychotic activity. A preferred representative of 
the disclosed compounds is the thiaspiron of formula (II) 
It is surprising that although the compounds according 
to the invention are structurally similar to the prior art 
compounds, they exert fully different activities. According to another aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a process for the preparation of new 
compounds of general formula (I) and acid-addition salts 
thereof, which comprises 
a) for the preparation of a compound of general formula 
(I), wherein A represents a group of formula -C≡C-, 
subjecting 8-azaspiro[4,5]decane-7,9-dione-8-propyne(2) 
with 1-(1,2-benzisothiazol-3-yl)piperazine to Mannich 
condensation; or b) for the preparation of a compound of general formula 
(I), wherein A stands for a group of formula -C≡C-, 
reacting 8-azaspiro[4,5]decane-7,9-dione-8-propyne(2) 
with an alkyl magnesium halide of formula R-Mg-Hal, 
wherein R stands for alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atom(s) 
and Hal denotes chlorine, bromine or iodine, reacting 
the thus-obtained propyne magnesium halide of general 
formula (III),   
wherein Hal is as stated above, with at least one molar 
equivalent of trioxymethylene or formaldehyde, converting the 
butynol
