<ABSTRACT>
An integral double-helix spring (90) comprises first and 
second end members (92, 94) and first and second resilient 

helical members (100, 102) which extend between the first and 
second end members (92, 94) along a longitudinal axis (104). 

The first and second helical members (100, 102) are configured 
such that lateral reaction forces thereof are mutually canceling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the art of 
reciprocating piston assemblies, and more specifically to a 
linear compressor including a housing defining a compression 
chamber therein having a variable volume, a piston for varying 
said volume of said compression chamber, a spring, including 
a first end member which is attached to the piston and a fixed 
second end member, and a driver for causing the piston to move 
against a force of the spring. Such a linear compressor is known from US-A-3 588 291.  
 A similar linear compressor which is known in the art is 
illustrated in Fig. 1 and designated as 10. A variable compression 
chamber 12 is defined within a housing 14 by cylinders 
16 and 18 which are joined at their inner ends. Pistons 20 and 
22 are slidable in the cylinders 16 and 18 for movement toward 
and away from the center of the compression chamber 12 and 
movably define the longitudinal ends of the compression chamber 
12.  
 The pistons 20 and 22 are reciprocated by linear 
moving coil motors 26 and 28 respectively in a synchronized 
manner. More specifically, the motors 26 and 28 move the 
pistons 20 and 22 respectively toward the center of the 
compression chamber 12 together and away from the center of 
the compression 12 together in symmetrical reciprocating 
movements. Movement of the pistons 20 and 22 toward the 
center of the compression chamber 12 causes the pressure 
therein to increase, and vice-versa. The compression chamber 12 is connected to a load such 
as a regenerator of a cryogenic cooler (not shown) through 
an outlet 24. The compression chamber 12, outlet 24, 
regenerator and interconnecting conduit are filled with a 
working gas such as helium such that reciprocation of the 
pistons 20 and 22 causes the working gas pressure to 
pulsate which in turn causes a piston in the regenerator to 
reciprocate and generate a thermodynamic Stirling cycle 
which causes absorption of heat from the cooled end and 
rejection of heat from the other end of the regenerator. The motor 26 includes a generally cup-shaped armature 
30 which is fixed to the piston 20 for integral movement. 
A coil 32 is wound around the armature 30 and connected to 
an electronic drive unit (not shown) by a lead 34. An 
annular permanent magnet 36 is fixed to the inner surface 
of the housing 14 radially outward of the coil 32. A 
helical spring 38 has a left end fixed to the left end of 
the housing 14 and a right end attached to the armature 30. The piston 20, armature 30 and spring 36 are
