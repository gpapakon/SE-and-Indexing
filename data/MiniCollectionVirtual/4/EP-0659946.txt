<ABSTRACT>
A toilet bidet (10) provides a cold water supply hose (14) for attachment 
to an existing toilet's filler tube (16), may include a heating unit (18) 

mounted to the side of the existing toilet tank (20), a water delivery hose 
(22) leading to a bracket housing (24) mounted on the rim (26) of the existing 

toilet bowl (28), and a pivotable bidet arm (30) directing the water upwards 
through a bidet nozzle (32) towards the center of the toilet bowl (28). The 

heating unit (18) is activated by a tank-mounted switch (34) having a float 
switch or switch arm (36) extending beneath the existing toilet's float arm 

(38), so that each time the toilet is flushed, and the float arm (38) falls 
with the dropping water level in the tank (20), the float switch or switch 

arm (36) is depressed, thereby activating the heating unit (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to household 
plumbing and related fixtures, and more specifically to an 
improved bidet apparatus for connection to standard toilet 
fixtures. Toilet fixtures and bidets are well known. Most 
known bidets are stand-alone units, requiring additional 
bathroom floor space and appropriate separate plumbing to 
install. As an alternative, some designers have developed 
portable bidet units that can be used in conjunction with 
an existing toilet. However, these portable units are 
typically bulky and awkward to use, and still require 
supplemental plumbing to install. Other known portable 
units have a self-contained water supply, but these 
generally require constant heating of the water for 
spontaneous use, and repetitive refilling of the water 
reservoir for continued use. The toilet bidet of this invention provides a 
bidet apparatus suitable for retrofit installation to 
existing toilet fixtures, or original installation into 
manufactured fixtures. The toilet bidet comprises a cold 
water supply hose conditioned for attachment to an 
existing toilet's filler tube, and may include a battery 
or household-current powered heating unit mounted to the 
side of the existing toilet tank, a (warm) water delivery 
hose leading to a bracket housing mounted on the rim of 
the existing toilet bowl, and a pivotable bidet arm 
directing the water upwards through a bidet nozzle towards 
the center of the toilet bowl. The optional heating unit is activated by a 
tank-mounted switch having a float switch or switch arm 
extending beneath the existing toilet's float arm (which 
connects to the existing toilet's float ball), so that 
each time the toilet is flushed, and the float arm falls  
 
with the dropping water level in the tank, the float 
switch or switch arm is depressed, thereby activating the 
heating unit. At the same time, water from the toilet's 
filler tube, which normally would be directed to the 
toilet tank's overflow tube, is instead delivered through 
the bidet's cold water supply hose to the heating unit 
where it is warmed, and thence through the bidet's water 
delivery hose to the bidet arm and nozzle for delivery to 
the user. The bidet arm and nozzle are pivotally mounted 
so that they normally rest against the side of the toilet 
bowl, but pivot towards the center of the bowl upon water 
delivery. After flushing, the toilet tank refills with 
water, raising the float switch (or the float arm and the 
switch arm) to turn off the heating unit. At the same 
time,

A toilet bidet for connection to a toilet 
fixture having a toilet tank, toilet bowl, and filler 

tube, said toilet bidet comprising: 
   a water supply hose conditioned for 

attachment to said filler tube; 
   a bracket housing connected to said water 

supply hose; said bracket housing conditioned for mounting 
to said toilet bowl; and 

   a bidet arm connected to said bracket 
housing, said bidet arm including a bidet nozzle, wherein 

when said toilet fixture is flushed, said filler tube 
delivers water through said water supply hose to said 

bracket housing and said bidet arm for delivery through 
said bidet nozzle. 
The toilet bidet of claim 1 wherein said 
bidet arm is pivotable within said bracket housing, and 

further including means for moving said bidet arm so that 

when water is delivered to said bidet arm, said bidet arm 
is urged towards the center of said toilet bowl, and when 

no water is delivered to said bidet arm, said bidet arm 
returns back towards the side of said toilet bowl. 
A toilet bidet for connection to a toilet 
fixture having a toilet tank, toilet bowl, and filler 

tube, said toilet bidet comprising: 
   a cold water supply hose conditioned for 

attachment to said filler tube; 
   a heating unit connected to said cold water 

supply hose, said heating unit conditioned for mounting to 
said toilet tank; 

   a warm water delivery hose connected to 
said heating unit; 

   a bracket housing connected to said warm 
water delivery hose; said bracket housing conditioned for 

mounting to said toilet bowl; 
   a bidet arm connected to said bracket 

housing, said bidet arm including a bidet nozzle; and
 

   a switch member including a float switch, 
said switch member connected to said heating unit, wherein 

when said toilet fixture is flushed, said float switch 
activates said heating unit, said filler tube delivers 

water through said cold water supply hose to said heating 
unit, and said heating unit delivers heated water through 

said warm water delivery hose to said bracket housing and 
said bidet arm for delivery through said bidet nozzle. 
The toilet bidet of claim 3 wherein said 
bidet arm is pivotable within said bracket housing, and 

further including means for moving said bidet arm so that 
when water is delivered to said bidet arm, said bidet arm 

is urged towards the center of said toilet bowl, and when 
no water is delivered to said bidet arm, said bidet arm 

returns back towards the side of said toilet bowl. 
A toilet bidet for connection to a toilet 
fixture having a toilet tank, toilet bowl, filler tube, 

and float arm, said toilet bidet comprising: 
   a cold water supply hose conditioned for 

attachment to said filler tube; 
   a heating unit connected to said cold water 

supply hose, said heating unit conditioned for mounting to 
said toilet tank; 

   a warm water delivery hose connected to 
said heating unit; 

   a bracket housing connected to said warm 
water delivery hose; said bracket housing conditioned for
