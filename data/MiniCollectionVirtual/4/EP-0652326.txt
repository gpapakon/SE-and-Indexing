<ABSTRACT>
The support post (1) for a barrier for protecting against falling rocks includes a shaft (10) bearing on the ground (2) at its foot, and a base (11) on which the shaft (10) is fixed rigidly by means of gussets (15). An attachment rod (5) is driven substantially perpendicularly into the ground as far as an anchor (4) (cement block), according to the so-called exploded pile technique, and passes through a central region (11b) of the base. A coil spring (13) is threaded onto the rod and is held in compression by a nut (14). The base thus bears on the ground (2) by means of prestressing of the spring (13). The lateral forces on the post (1), resulting from the impact of rocks on the barrier, are compensated for by tilting of the base (11) about a tangent to its periphery (11a), against the compression of the spring (13). The stresses on the post are therefore damped, and positioning of the post requires only a single anchoring point.

A support post (1) for a guard barrier such as a check barrier 
for blocks moving down a slope, comprising a shaft (10, 20, 30) bearing 

at its foot against the ground (2) and held erect by attachment means 
(5) connected to anchoring points (3, 4) laid in the ground (2) 

characterised in that the shaft (10, 20, 30) is fixed at its foot on a 
base (11, 21, 31) which bears against the ground (2) at least by way of 

its periphery (11a), the attachment means being formed by a single rod 
(5) which penetrates substantially perpendicularly into the ground (2) 

to a buried bedding portion (4) forming the anchoring point and passing 
through a central zone of the base (11b, 21b, 31d) to urge same into 

contact against the ground by way of spring means (13) which are in a 
prestressed condition in the direction of the rod (5), the rod being 

under a tensile load. 
A post according to claim 1 characterised in that the spring 
means are formed by a coil spring (13) fitted on the rod above the base 

(11, 21, 31) and held in compression against the base by a nut (14) 
screwed on the end of the rod (5a). 
A post according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised in that 
the periphery of the base (11, 21, 31) is inscribed in a convex surface, 

within which is disposed the central zone (11b, 21b, 31d) through which 
the attachment rod (5) passes. 
A post according to claim 3 characterised in that the base (11, 
21) is substantially circular. 
A post according to claim 3 characterised in that the base (31) 
is formed by at least three arms (31a, 31b, 31c) extending radially from 

the central zone (31d) through which the attachment rod (5) passes.  
 
A post according to any one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in 
that the shaft (10, 20, 30) is connected to the base by securing means 

(15, 25, 35). 
A post according to claim 6 characterised in that the securing 
means comprise stay plates (15, 25) extending radially from the shaft 

(10, 20) in the region of the foot (10a, 20a) towards the periphery 
(11a, 21a) of the base. 
A post according to claim 6 characterised in that the securing 
means comprise bracing wires (35) disposed between the head region (30b) 

of the shaft (30) and the periphery of the base (31). 
A post according to any one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in 
that it further comprises a base plate (40) interposed between the 

periphery of the base (11) and the ground (2).
