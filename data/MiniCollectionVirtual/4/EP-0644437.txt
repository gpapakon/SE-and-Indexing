<ABSTRACT>
In an EPI or GRASE magnetic resonance method, phase errors caused by 
the alternation of the read gradient polarity (G
x
) are corrected by obtaining a set of 
reference measurements with both polarities at low values in the phase encoding (
k
y
) 
direction. From these reference measurements the phase errors are estimated. 

Subsequently, the measurements covering the whole of 
k
-space are corrected and a 
magnetic resonance image obtained in which artefacts due to the alternating polarity of 

the read gradient are suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for magnetic resonance imaging of a
body placed in a stationary and substantially homogeneous main magnetic field, the
method comprising the steps that are specified in claim 1.The invention also relates to an apparatus for magnetic resonance imaging
of a body placed in a stationary and substantially homogeneous main magnetic field,
the apparatus comprising the features
that are specified in claim 8. Such a method is known from DE-A 40 05 675 and from the article
"Image reconstruction for echo planar imaging with non equidistant k-space sampling",
by H. Bruder et al. in Magn. Reson. Med., Vol. 23, pages 311-323 (1992). In the
known method, the first set of data is acquired with continuously switched on phase
encoding gradient and alternating read gradient magnetic fields. Consequently, the
acquired signal samples are located on slightly curved lines substantially extending in
the read direction in k-space and spaced apart in the phase encoding direction. The lines
cover substantially the whole of k-space. The signal samples of the second set are
acquired without a phase encoding gradient, so all samples in this second set are located
on a single line in the read direction, through the origin of k-space. The known method
provides only a possibility to correct phase errors that are constant in the phase
encoding direction. Errors that have also a varying effect in a direction perpendicular to
the read direction cannot be corrected.In US-A 5 055 789 a method and device are described for correction
phase errors in two dimensions. According to that known method a measurement is
made of inhomogeneities Î”H(x,y) in the stationary magnetic field and of the spatial
non-linearity and the temporal variations of the gradient magnetic fields. These 
measurements are made beforehand by direct or indirect measurements of the magnetic
fields. After data acquisition the signal samples acquired with a positive and with
negative polarity read gradient are separated and image reconstruction is performed for
both classes of data. Both images are separately corrected in accordance with the
measured deviations of the magnetic fields and other relevant contributions. Finally the
two images are synthesised into a single image.The purpose of such measurements is to improve the quality of the
magnetic resonance image to be obtained by correcting for the differences of sampled
magnetic resonance signals that are acquired with a positive and a negative polarity read
gradient.In the second known
