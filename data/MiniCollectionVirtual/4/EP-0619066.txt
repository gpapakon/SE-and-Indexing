either a 
scion (20;245) or a stock (38) is inserted; and a cutting blade member 

(25;205) arranged along a generatrix of the conical hole (276;203); 
and a 

relative movement device (21,22,23) for rendering vertical and rotational 
relative movements between the holding means and the 

cutting means to cut either a lower end portion of a scion (20;245) 
or an upper end portion of a stock (38) into a conical 

projection (43;246). 
The cutting blade member is moved upward and downward 

at an ultrasonic high speed. This apparatus enables

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a grafting method and apparatus 
for uniting a lower end portion of a scion to an upper 
end portion of a stock. Grafting is a plant growing method which produces a new 
individual plant by uniting a scion having the affinity 
relative to a stock to the stock in order to improve the 
acclimation, noxious insect-resistant, flowerability, and 
fructifiability. In grafting, there have been splice, 
saddle, and cleft grafting methods, etc. For example, as shown in Fig. 18, in the cleft grafting 
method, a lower end portion of a scion 451 is cut up into a 
wedge-like form by the use of a knife or the like and a 
corresponding wedge-like slit 453 is formed at an upper end 
partion of a stack 452. After the lower end portion of the 
scion 451 is inserted into the slit 453 to unite the vascular 
bundles of the scion 451 and the stack 452, the united 
portion is gripped by an auxiliary fixing device such as a 
clip. This cleft grafting method of inserting the lower end 
portion of the scion 451 cut up into the wedge-like form 
into the slit 453 of the stack 452 has suffered the following 
problems: 1) a skill is required to unite the scion 451  
 
to the stock 452 in a proper state; and 2) it is difficult 
to automate the grafting operation. More specifically, 
uniting surfaces of the scion 451 and the stock 452 consist 
of a pair of flat surfaces each, and only parts of vessels 
454 and sieve tubes 455 constituting the vascular bundles 
are exposed at opposite uniting surfaces. Accordingly, it 
is difficult to position and unite the vessels 454 and sieve 
tubes 455 of the scion 451 to those of the stock 452 accurately. 
This has stood as a hindrance to the automation. 
In addition, it has been difficult to automate an operation 
of attaching the auxiliary fixing device to the united 
portion of the scion 451 and stock 452 and an operation of 
detaching the auxiliary fixing device after the uniting 
portion is connected fast. Also, it has been very difficult to cut the seedling by 
means of the razor blade or the like into a proper shape 
without destroying its tissue having an anisotropic fibroid 
structure, which accordingly hinders automation of grafting 
operation. More specifically, to cut the scion 451 into a 
desired shape while holding a stem of the scion 451 by the 
holding member, it is necessary to give an appropriate 
intensity of cutting energy to the razor blade. Unless the 
necessary cutting energy is given to the cutting blade, the 
cut surface of the scion 451 will not

comprising the steps of:
 
   forming a conical projection (43; 246) on either a lower end 

portion of a scion or an upper end portion of a stock;
 
   forming a conical recess (44, 46) on either a lower end portion
