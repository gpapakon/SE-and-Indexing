<ABSTRACT>
A camera (40) is mounted on a gimbal (44) inside a 
missile (30) and views forwardly through a transparent, 

generally conical front dome or ogive (70). An optically 
refractive corrector (72) is mounted in front of the camera 

lens (42) for integral movement therewith. The corrector 
(72) has a least one conical surface segment (74a,74b) 

which is dimensioned to reverse optical conical deformation 
created by the dome (70). The conical deformation includes 

little or no refractive power in a plane defined by the 
axis (38) of the dome (70) and the look axis (46) of the 

camera (40) and gimbal (44), and progressively varying one-dimensional 
refraction perpendicular to this plane. 

Variables including the apex angles (α1,α2) of cones 
(76,78) which define the surfaces (74a,74b), the angle (α3) 

between the axes (76b,78b) of the cones (76,78), the 
distances (D1,D2) between the apices (76a,78a) of the cones 

(76,78) and the center (74c) of the corrector (72), the 
tilt angle (α5) and the index of refraction of the corrector 

(72) provide sufficient degrees of freedom to enable a 
best fit solution which substantially reverses the conical 

deformation created by the dome (70).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the art of 
optical imaging systems, and more specifically to the 
correction of conical deformation created by a camera 
viewing through a transparent, generally conical dome or 
ogive. A rocket or missile is preferably provided with a 
streamlined nose cone or front dome to minimize aerodynamic 
drag and maximize the efficiency of its propulsion system. 
The dome is pointed at its front end, and is axi-symmetric 
in that its cross section in any plane perpendicular to its 
longitudinal axis is circular. The dome can be perfectly 
conical, or have a generally conical ogive shape with a 
gradually curved cross section in a plane passing through 
its longitudinal axis. Cameras are carried by missiles for guidance, tracking 
and information gathering purposes. The camera must face 
generally forward for tracking a ground or airborne target. 
It is highly desirable to make the dome transparent and 
mount the camera on a gimbal inside the missile so that it  
 
can view forwardly through the dome at a variable angle. 
However, the dome creates optical aberrations which make 
objects viewed therethrough appear offset from their true 
positions. A dome having an ogive shape such as defined by the 
well known Von Karman equations is desirable over a 
perfectly conical dome since it produces less drag. 
However, a curved dome such as a Von Karman ogive introduces 
an aberration known as "boresight error" such that a ray 
passing through the dome surface exits at an angle which is 
non-parallel to its entrance angle. Boresight error can be eliminated by making the inner 
surface of the dome non-parallel to the outer surface as 
disclosed in US-A-5 220 159 which was published after the priority date of this present patent application but before the filing date thereof. A second type of aberration created by viewing through 
a conical or generally conical ogive dome is known as 
"conical deformation", and is generally astigmatic. For a 
perfectly conical dome, there is zero refractive power in 
a plane defined by the longitudinal axis of the dome and 
the gimbal look axis, and one-dimensional diverging power 
perpendicular to this plane. The power is theoretically 
infinite at the tip of the dome, and decreases progressively 
with distance from the tip. For a Von Karman or other 
ogive having a curved shape, there is also a relatively 
small amount of diverging power in the plane of the dome 
and gimbal look axes. The one-dimensional refraction created by a conical 
dome
