A spiral vortex device for the specific purpose of
generating spiral flows in a liquid, more particularly

in water, comprising

a rotationally symmetrical and substantially
ellipsoidal outer container (10), which in its

zone which is at the bottom during operation of
the spiral vortex device has a smaller inside

diameter than in its corresponding top zone,
a rotationally symmetrical and substantially
hyperbolically funnel-shaped inner container,

which is disposed centrally in the outer container
(10) and which has at least one bottom and one top

opening, its smallest-diameter zone being situated
in the smallest-diameter zone of the outer

container (10), and the longitudinal axis of the
outer container (10) coinciding with the

longitudinal axis of the inner container (20),
at least one deflecting means (35) in the top zone
of the outer container above the top opening of

the inner container (20), and
a drive shaft (40), which drives either the outer
container (10) with the inner container (20)

stationary or the inner container (20) with the
outer container (10) stationary, an ascending

spiral flow forming between the outer container
(10) and the inner container (20) during

operation, the direction of said flow being
reversed by interaction with the deflecting means 

(35) and the flow then falling with a spiral
rotation in the reverse direction inside the inner

container (20).
A spiral vortex device according to claim 1,
characterised in that the deflecting means is disposed

in the form of deflecting plates (35) above the top
opening of the inner container (20).
A spiral vortex device according to claim 2,
characterised in that the cross-section of a deflecting

plate (35) is arcuate.
A spiral vortex device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that liquid for

treatment is adapted to be supplied continuously via a
feed pipe (30) and treated liquid is dischargeable via

an outflow pipe (50).
A spiral vortex device according to claim 4,
characterised in that the liquid supply is controllable

via a first valve (31) in the feed pipe (30) and/or the
liquid outflow is controllable via a second valve (51)

in the outflow pipe (50).
A spiral vortex device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the outer

container (10) performs 1 to 1500 rpm relatively to the
inner container (20).
A spiral vortex device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the outer

container (10) is rigidly connected to the drive shaft 
(40), while the inner container (20) is fixed in its

position of rest via a mounting (30, 33, 34).
A spiral vortex device according to claim 7,
characterised in that the feed pipe (30) and the

outflow pipe (50) enter the rotatable outer container
(10) via a sealing-tight connection.
A spiral vortex device according to claim 7 or 8,
characterised in that the mounting (30, 33, 34)

surrounds the feed pipe (30).
A spiral vortex device according to any one of
claims 7 to 9, characterised in that the deflecting

plates (35) are fixed on the mounting (30, 33, 34).
A spiral vortex device according to claim 9 or 10,
characterised in that the feed pipe (30) is disposed

concentrically to the axis of rotation of the outer
container (10) and is connected to radially extending

rods (33) which engage the inside of the inner
container (20).
A spiral vortex device according to claim 11,
characterised in that the rods (33) are stabilised by a

ring (34) on which the deflecting plates (35) are
mounted.
A spiral vortex device according to any one of
claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the inner

container is rigidly connected to the drive shaft while
the outer container is fixed. 
A spiral vortex device according to claim 13,
characterised in that the feed pipe and the outflow

pipe are rigidly connected to the outer container.
A spiral vortex device according to claim 13 or
14, characterised in that the deflecting plates are

rigidly connected to the outer container.
A spiral vortex device according to any one of
claims 13 to 15, characterised in that the drive shaft

extends parallel and/or concentrically to the feed
pipe.
A spiral vortex device according to any one of
claims 13 to 16, characterised in that the drive shaft

is connected to the inner container at its narrow
funnel end, openings being provided between the drive

shaft and the inner container.
A spiral vortex device according to any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the feed pipe

(30) and the outflow pipe (50) are disposed at the same
end or at opposite ends of the spiral vortex device.
A spiral vortex device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the drive shaft

(40) is connected to a V-belt, a hand crank, a motor,
or the like.
A spiral vortex device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the outer

container (10) is disposed in a protective cover. 
A spiral vortex device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the outer

container (10) and/or the inner container (20) consist
of a transparent material, such as glass.
A spiral vortex device according to any one of
claims 1 to 20, characterised in that the outer

container (10) and/or the inner container (20) consist
of clay, ceramics and/or porcelain.
