<ABSTRACT>
A laser plate making apparatus is disclosed for 
forming a press plate from a form plate sheet. The 

apparatus includes a laser light source for providing a 
laser beam, a collimator lens, an objective lens and an 

anamorphic prism. The laser light source serves to emit a 
laser beam onto the form plate sheet through the 

collimator lens, the objective lens and the anamorphic 
prism. The anamorphic prism serves to shape the laser 

beam such that even if a focal stripe width is made small 
the focal depth is not substantially shortened.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a laser plate making
apparatus for forming a press plate useful for, for
example, a gravure printing press.In many conventional laser plate making
apparatus, a laser light source having a laser head is
used to direct a laser beam onto a form plate sheet. The
form plate sheet is wound around a plate cylinder which
rotates in a main scanning direction. In addition, the
laser light source is moved in the axial or sub scanning
direction of the plate cylinder such that recesses are
formed over substantially the entire surface of the form
plate sheet to form a press plate. In this case, the
recesses on the press plate form a halftone dot image.In the drawings, Figure 8 schematically shows a
typical structure of a laser optical system employed in a
laser plate making apparatus based on conventional
technology. Such a system is described in GB-A-2223984 on
which the pre-characterising portion of claim 1 is based.
In Fig. 8, a laser head 1 is shown which includes a laser
diode 2, a collimator lens 3 and an objective lens 4.In Figure 8, reference numeral 5 represents a
beam profile of a laser beam emitted from the laser diode
2, and a luminous stripe width in the horizontal direction
of the laser beam 5 is represented by dLDN. Further,
reference numeral 6 represents a focal position, or a beam
profile of the laser beam on the form 
plate sheet, and the focal stripe width in the horizontal direction
of the laser beam 6 is represented by dH.In the laser optical system of the example in Fig. 8, the
laser beam 5 having a luminance stripe width dLDH is emitted from
the laser diode 2 having a light emitting power of about 1 W and is
collimated by the collimator lens 3. The laser beam 5 is then
collected through the objective lens 4, so that it forms an image
as a focal stripe width dH at the focal position of the objective
lens 4. Here, the focal length of the collimator lens 3 is
represented by f1 and the focal length of the objective lens 4 is
represented by f2.Typical values for the laser optical system shown in Fig. 8,
are as follows:
luminance stripe width dLDH = 200 µmfocal length f1 of the collimator lens 3 = 11.67 mmfocal length f2 of the objective lens 4 = 7 mmfocal stripe width dH = 120 µm.
In this case, the focal stripe distance dH is determined by the
relation of the following Equation 1.
dH = (f2/f1) · dLDHIn a laser optical system employed in a laser plate making
apparatus for making a press plate, the position of the image
surface frequently changes due to factors such as
