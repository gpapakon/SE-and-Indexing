<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for spatial modulation in the cross-process 
direction is provided in which a spatial light modulator includes an array 

(12) of individual elements. Light from a light source (14) is reflected from 
these individual elements onto phases of pixels (20 and 54) of an organic 

photoconductive drum (16). The light from the individual elements may be 
focused through optics (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to spatial modulation, and more
particularly to a
printer of the type defined in the precharacterizing
portion of claim 1 and to a method of printing as defined in the
precharacterizing portion of claim 7.Spatial light modulator (SLM) technology has found applications in
many fields, a significant one of which is that of printing. In particular, a
sub-class of SLMs, known as deformable-mirror devices or digital
micromirror devices (DMDs), provide significant advantages when used in
printing systems.In such systems, two types of data are typically presented. The first
type of printing data is image data. Image data includes, for example,
pictures of objects, such as those reproduced from photographs. With image
data, the ability to print shades of gray (gray scale data) is imperative.
Generally speaking, the ability to produce more shades of gray results in
higher quality image printing. This ability, however, is often expensive and
complicated to achieve. Thus, there is a significant need to reduce the
complexity and cost of systems that can generate high quality images.The second type of data is graphics data, such as data for text or
charts. Graphics data is predominantly black and white, or other pure
saturated colors. With graphics data, there is less need for gray shades.
Thus, high quality graphics data can be printed so long as the resolution of
the printer is high. Resolution is generally measured as the number of dots
per inch that can be printed on a page. At lower resolutions, boundaries of
graphics objects appear jagged. High resolution graphics require 600 dots 
per inch or higher. As such high resolution systems are often complex and
expensive, there is an ever pressing need to reduce their cost and complexity.Existing electro photo-graphic printer technologies make use of an
organic photoconductive (OPC) drum. Depending on the type of
photoconductor used, the drum is either charged or discharged to attract
toner, with the charging or discharging accomplished by reflecting light onto
the drum from a DMD array. Ideally, the amount of toner that clings to any
point on the drum would be a function of the level of charge (or discharge) on
that point. In this ideal case, gray scaling could be done simply by adjusting
the charge or discharge of each point so as to control the amount of toner on
any point, and thus the gray scale printed. However, with existing
technologies, toner clings to the drum in such a manner that typically about
four to thirty-two levels

circuitry operable to periodically change the intensity of

the light source (14). 
The printer of any preceding claim, said array (12) of
individual elements comprising rows of individual elements,

each said row offset in said cross-process direction from an
