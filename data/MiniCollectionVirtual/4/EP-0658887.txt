<ABSTRACT>
An optical data storage system comprises a multiple data surface 
medium and optical head. The medium comprises a plurality of substrates 

separated by a light transmissive medium. Data surfaces are located on 
the substrate surfaces. A layer of a dye material is deposited onto each 

of the data surfaces. The thickness of the dye layer determines the 
amount of reflectivity for each of the data surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical data storage media and
systems and more specifically to a storage system having multiple data
storage surfaces.Optical data storage systems provide a means for storing great
quantities of data on a disk. The data is accessed by focusing a laser
beam onto the data layer of the disk and then detecting the reflected
light beam. Various kinds of systems are known. In a ROM (Read Only
Memory) system, data is permanently embedded as marks in the disk at the
time of manufacture of the disk. The data is detected as a change in
reflectivity as the laser beam passes over the data marks. A WORM (Write
Once Read Many) system allows the user to write data by making marks,
such as pits, on a blank optical disk surface. Once the data is recorded
onto the disk it cannot be erased. The data in a WORM system is also
detected as a change in reflectivity.Erasable optical systems are also known. These systems use the
laser to heat the data layer above a critical temperature in order to
write and erase the data. Magneto-optical recording systems record data
by orienting the magnetic domain of a spot in either an up or a down
position. The data is read by directing a low power laser to the data
layer. The differences in magnetic domain direction cause the plane of
polarization of the light beam to be rotated one way or the other,
clockwise or counterclockwise. This change in orientation of
polarization is then detected. Phase change recording uses a structural
change of the data layer itself (amorphous/crystalline are two common
types of phases) to record the data. The data is detected as changes in
reflectivity as a beam passes over the different phases.Some of these optical disks use thin films to optimize performance.
See for example IBM TDB, Vol.33, No.10B, March 1991, p.482; Japanese
patent application 61-242356, published October 28, 1986; and Japanese
patent application 4-61045, published February 27, 1992.In order to increase the storage capacity of an optical disk,
multiple data layer systems have been proposed. An optical disk having
two or more data layers may in theory be accessed at different layers by
changing the focal position of the lens. Examples of this approach
include US Patent 3,946,367 issued March 23, 1976 by Wohlmut, et al.; US 
Patent 4,219,704 issued August 26, 1980 to Russell; US Patent 4,450,553
