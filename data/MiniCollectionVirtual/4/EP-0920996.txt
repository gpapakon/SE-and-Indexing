<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a liquid discharging 
head for discharging desired liquid by the creation of 
babbles caused by making heat energy act on the liquid, 
a method of manufacturing the liquid discharging head, 
a head cartridge carrying the liquid discharging head 
thereon and a liquid discharging apparatus. The 
invention particularly relates to a liquid discharging 
head having a movable member displaceable by the 
utilization of the creation of bubbles, a method of 
manufacturing the liquid discharging head, a head 
cartridge carrying the liquid discharging head thereon 
and a liquid discharging apparatus. The word "recording" in the present invention 
means not only imparting images having meanings such as 
characters and figures to a recording medium, but also 
imparting images having no meaning such as patters to 
the recording medium. There is known an ink jet recording method, i.e., 
a so-called bubble jet recording method of giving  
 
energy such as heat to ink to thereby create in the ink 
a state change resulting in a steep volume change 
(creation of a bubble), discharging the ink from a 
discharge port by an acting force based on the state 
change, causing the ink to adhere onto a recording 
medium and effecting image formation. A recording 
apparatus using this bubble jet recording method, as 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 61-59911 
and Japanese Patent Publication No. 61-59914, is 
generally provided with a discharge port for 
discharging ink therefrom, an ink flow path 
communicating with this discharge port, and a heating 
member (electro thermal converting member) as energy 
generating means disped in the ink flow path for 
discharging the ink. According to the recording method as described 
above, images of high dignity can be recorded at a high 
speed and with low noise and also, in a head for 
carrying out this recording method, discharge ports for 
discharging the ink therefrom can be disposed highly 
densely, and this leads to many excellent points that 
recorded images of high resolution and further, color 
images can be easily obtained by a compact apparatus, 
etc. In recent years, this bubble jet recording method 
has been utilized in many office instruments such as 
printers, copying apparatuses and facsimile 
apparatuses, and has come to be utilized even in an  
 
industrial system such as a textile printing apparatus. So, some of the inventors have returned to the 
principle of liquid discharge and have energetically 
carried out researches to provide a
