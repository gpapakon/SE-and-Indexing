Compositions including hydrogen peroxide, a carboxylic acid, and a peroxycarboxylic acid in which the weight ratio of the preroxycarboxylic acid to the hydrogen peroxide is at least 4:1 are effective against microorganims, particularly bacterial spores.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is generally directed to a composition having antimicrobial
activity, including activity against microbial spores. More particularly, a
composition of the invention includes hydrogen peroxide, a carboxylic acid, and a
peroxycarboxylic acid and has a weight ratio of a peroxycarboxylic acid to hydrogen
peroxide of at least 4:1. A composition of the invention is particularly useful for
microbiocidal treatment of substances being contaminated with microorganisms of
the Bacillus cereus group.A variety of industries such as, for example, the food industry, health-care
industry, institutional industry, and hospitality industry, have a need to use
antimicrobial treatments to reduce microbial populations in the environments in
which these industries are carried out. In some instances, these antimicrobial
treatments include the use of peracid materials.Compositions for peracid materials and their use for reducing microbial
populations are known. For example, Grosse-Bowing et al. (U.S. Patent Nos.
4,501,058 and 4,501,059) and Oakes et al. (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,200,189; 5,314,687;
and 5,718,910) disclose peracid materials in a variety of end uses. Similarly,
Cosentino et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,279,735) teach the use of peracid materials as a
sterilant for hollow fiber membranes such as those used in kidney-dialysis
procedures. Richter et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,436,008) teach unique peracid
sanitizing materials having applicability for treating food-processing equipment.Typical peracid materials include an equilibrium mixture of acetic acid,
hydrogen peroxide, peroxyacetic acid, and a stabilizer. A stabilizer typically reduces
the impact of divalent or trivalent metal ions on the decomposition of the active
peroxygen species. Suitable stabilizers include a chelant or sequestrant. Although peracid materials typically have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial
properties, their activity against bacterial spores, fungal spores, and fungi can be less
than desirable. Killing, inactivating, or otherwise reducing the active population of
bacterial spores, fungal spores, and fungi on surfaces (e.g., especially food surfaces
and food-contact surfaces, which are typically hard surfaces including metal, glass,
composite materials, etc.) is a particularly difficult problem. In particular, bacterial
spores have a unique chemical composition of spore layers that make them more
resistant than vegetative bacteria to the antimicrobial effects of chemical and
physical agents. Like bacterial spores, the unique chemical
