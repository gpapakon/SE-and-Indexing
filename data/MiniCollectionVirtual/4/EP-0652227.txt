<ABSTRACT>
A method of purifying a hydrophobic polypeptide by high-performance liquid chromatography using a mobile 
phase comprising a solvent mixture wherein the content of trifluoroacetic acid is 3-10% (v/v) and a packing material 

comprising polyvinyl alcohol. This method is useful because a lung surfactant prepared from the hydrophobic 
polypeptide purified by this method has a surface activity superior to that of the hydrophobic polypeptide purified by 

the conventional methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a purification
method for hydrophobic polypeptides, and more
particularly to a purification method for hydrophobic
polypeptides which show a more intensive surface
activity in combination with a lipid mixture.Infantile respiratory distress syndrome is a
disease which induces serious respiratory disorder as a
result of the collapse of lung due to a deficiency of
pulmonary surfactant and is observed in premature
newborns with high mortality. In recent years, for the
treatment of this respiratory distress syndrome, a
supplemental therapy in which pulmonary surfactant is
administered via a transairway route from the outside
has been developped, and this therapy has demonstrated
successful results.Some of the inventors of the present invention
isolated lipoprotein from pulmonary surfactant derived
from animals, and they have found that the lipoprotein
is an essential component for showing pulmonary surface
activity, and that pulmonary surfactant including the
complex lipid-lipoprotein mixture prepared by combining
said lipoprotein with a lipid mixture showed excellent
surface activity, namely the surface tension reducing
effect, and to provide an alveolar space volume
sufficient to maintain normal respiratory function by
shortening the niveau surface spreading time and low
equilibrium surface tension, thereby making the
lipoprotein suitable for the treatment of respiratory
distress syndrome (See Japanese Patent Publication No.
Hei 3-78371 Gazette). Furthermore, the inventors of the present invention
found that a synthesized polypeptide having a partial
structure of apoprotein C (sequence number 11,
hereinafter referred to as "SP-C"), which is a specific
apoprotein of the pulmonary surface of mammals, shows
strong surface activity when it is combined with a lipid
mixture (Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 4-98083).However, purification of SP-C and the synthesized
polypeptide described above having partial structure of
SP-C was very difficult due to the extremely low
solubility of these polypeptides in the moving phase,
which is due to their very high hydrophobic properties
under the conditions of normal high-performance liquid
chromatography (hereinafter referred to as "HPLC").In general, a hydrophobic protein or polypeptide is
defined as one having a relatively high content of
hydrophobic amino acids (including isoleucine, tyrosine,
phenylalanine, leucine, valine and methionine) in the
component amino acid residues. In Table 1, the total
number of amino acid residues in
