<ABSTRACT>
An air filter comprises a first (21) and second (22) layer of woven electrostatic material (100). The woven electrostatic material (100) comprises a warp (120) of positively or negatively chargeable material and a weft (110) of oppositely chargeable material. The material (100) has the combined electrostatic characteristics of both positively and negatively charged material. The layers of material are separated in a filter by an air permeable material (22) comprising a block of woven polypropylene, open-cell polyurethane or polyester. The woven material (100) and/or the air permeable material (22) is impregnated with a microbiological growth control agent. The filter is reversible and may be placed in a bidirectional air flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTROSTATIC FILTERThe present invention relates to woven electrostatic material and in particular to an air filter comprising such woven electrostatic material.It is well know that dust particles in a stream of air may be attracted to a charged surface by electrostatic interaction. Such surfaces may be made from fibrous material which may be woven. This woven material may be provided with an electrostatic charge which may be sustained over a long period. Filters which use such woven sheets of material have been shown to provide superior filtration. In a known air filter, the filter comprises two pairs of woven electrostatic material layers, typically polypropylene. Each pair of layers comprise a first layer of material that will develop a positive charge and a second layer of material that will develop a negative charge in response to an air flow therethrough. The air flow entry side of such a filter comprises a first pair of layers where the positively chargeable layer of woven material is outwardly disposed. The exit side comprises a second pair of layers where the negatively charged layer of said material is outwardly disposed. Between said electrostatic filter layer pairs there is provided a foam material, for example, a polyurethane material which also has electrostatic properties. This type of filter is exemplified in the disclosure of United States Patent No. 4,902,306.Prior art electrostatic air filters are known to have certain disadvantages. Firstly, due to the electrostatic charge, dust particles adhere to the woven material blocking its pores and thus restrict air flow. 

Furthermore, due to the build-up of dust particles on said woven material, the electrostatic charge tends to decrease within a relatively short period of time. Additionally, due to the restricted air flow and the build-up of dust particles in the filter, a breeding ground for bacteria, fungi, yeasts and other micro-organisms may be provided.With most electrostatic filters air flow direction must be determined before installation of the filter. The filter must be installed to present a predetermined face to the air flow for maximum efficiency. If the filter is incorrectly installed or the air flow direction changes the filter operates below its optimum efficiency.It is an object of the present to seek to alleviate the above disadvantages and to provide an improved electrostatic filter.Accordingly, the present invention provides a woven electrostatic material characterised in that the material comprises a warp of

CLAIMS :
1. Woven electrostatic material (100) characterised in that the material (100) comprises a warp (120) of negatively or positively chargeable material and a weft (110) of oppositely chargeable material, which warp and weft are interwoven to form a material having the combined electrostatic characteristics of both a positively and negatively charged material.
2. Woven electrostatic material as claimed in claim 1 , characterised in that the woven material is impregnated with at least one microbiological growth control agent.
3. Woven electrostatic material as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that the growth control agent or agents is or are selected from the group comprising fungicides, fungistats, biocides, biostats, bactericides and bacteriostats.
4. Woven material as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that the warp and the weft each comprise polypropylene.
5. An air filter comprising first (21) and second (23) layers of a woven electrostatic material characterised in that said electrostatic material comprises an interwoven negatively or positively chargeable warp and an oppositely chargeable weft, said layers of woven electrostatic material being separated by an intermediate air permeable material (23) .
6. An air filter as claimed in Claim 5 characterised in that the or each layer of woven material and/or the 


intermediate material is or are impregnated with a microbiological growth control agent.
7. An air filter as claimed in Claim 5 or Claim 6 characterised in that the woven material comprises an anti-clogging means for filtering dust particles from the air flow path, and in that the air filter further comprises a collecting tray for collecting dust particles repelled from the electrostatic material.
8. An air filter as claimed in any one of Claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the intermediate air permeable material comprises an electrostatic medium.
9. An air filter as claimed in any one of Claims 5 to 8, characterised in that the intermediate material comprises woven polypropylene, open-cell polyurethane or polyester.
10. An air filter as claimed in any one of claims 5 to 9 characterised in that the layers of woven material and the intermediate air permeable material are housed in a retaining frame (10), whereby the filter may be installed in a bi-directional air flow system or without consideration to air flow direction in a uni-directional system so as to provide a reversible filter.
