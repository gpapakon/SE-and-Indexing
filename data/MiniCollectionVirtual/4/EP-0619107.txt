<ABSTRACT>
A U-shaped external frame (18) and a rectangular internal frame (14) form the guide frame for a lifting plate (24) of a lifter. The two frames (14, 18) are each integrally manufactured from a glass fibre-reinforced plastic and have rail-guided sliding joints (20) which are integrally formed. The sliding joints (20) are formed on hook-shaped projections (38) of the long legs (28, 32) of the frames (14, 18). In the low position of the lifting plate (24) the sliding joints essentially lie below the contour of the external frame (18) or above the contour of the internal frame (14).

A lifting apparatus for handicapped persons, for 
insertion in a bathtub, comprising a bottom plate 

(12), a guide device consisting of two frames (14, 
18) joined together in a scissors-like, articulated 

manner, a lift platform (24) guided by said guide 
device, and a lifting device (26) for raising and 

lowering the lift platform (24), the two frames (14, 
18), each having two parallel longitudinal shanks 

(28, 32) and at least one transverse shank (30), 
(34, 36) and each frame (14, 18) having two coaxial 

non-sliding articulations (16) on one of the plates 
(12, 24) and two runner-guided sliding articulations 

(20), coaxial in each case, on the other of the two 
plates (12, 24), characterised in that, when the 

lift platform (24) is in its lowest position, the 
two frames (14, 18) are engaged in such a way that 

one frame (14) forms an inner frame, which occupies 
part of the internal space formed by the defining 

planes on both sides of the frame which constitutes 
an outer frame (18); that the central vertical plane 

of each longitudinal shank (28, 32) of both frames 
(14, 18) coincides with that of a runner (22); that 

the open side of each runner (22) faces away from 
the res
pective plate (12, 24); that the articulated 
axles of the sliding articulations (20) are spaced 

apart from the central longitudinal axis of the longitudinal 
shanks (28, 32) and offset towards the respective 

runners (22); that each sliding articulation 
(20) has two pegs (40) protruding in each case 

from opposing lateral surfaces of each longitudinal 
shank (28, 32); and that the pegs (40) are disposed 

immovably on the respective longitudinal shank (28, 
32).  

 
Lifting apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that each longitudinal shank (28, 32), together 

with its peg (40), is an integral moulded 
plastic part. 
Lifting apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that each longitudinal shank (28, 32) has a 

hook-like extension (38) on the side of the sliding 
articulation, which has the two pegs (40) disposed 

upon it. 
Lifting apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that each of the two frames (14, 18) is an 

integral moulded plastic part. 
Lifting apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, characterised 
in that the longitudinal and transverse shanks 

(28, 32; 30, 34, 36) of each frame (14, 18) are made 
of solid, fibre-reinforced plastic. 
Lifting apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that the articulated rod (20) which passes 

through and links the two frames (14, 18) centrally 
is unthreaded, that its length is less than the outer 

width of the outer frame (18), and that the articulated 
rod (20) abuts at one end against a plug 

(50) inserted in the longitudinal shank (28) of the 
outer frame (18). 
Lifting apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that the pegs (40) are not circular in shape 

and have at least one at least approximately flat 
supporting surface (42, 44), which is located in one 

of the two final raising positions of the lift platform 
(24), parallel to the runners (22) guiding 

them.  
 
Lifting apparatus as claimed in Claim 7, characterised 
in that the cross-section of each peg (40) has 

two flat supporting surfaces (42, 44), which diverge 
at an angle in the range of 40° to 60°, and whose 

diverging ends are joined together by a regular 
cylindrical surface (46) with a constant transition 

and extending over a circumferential angle of more 
than 225°. 
Lifting apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that a recess (48) is provided in the section 

between the two pegs (40) of one end of a longitudinal 
shank and extends along at least a part of 

the circumference of the peg. 
Lifting apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised 
in that the transverse shank (36) of the inner 

frame (14) on the side of the sliding articulation 
is in the form of a reinforcing plate with a broad 

surface.
