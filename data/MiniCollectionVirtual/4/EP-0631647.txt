<ABSTRACT>
An auxiliary catalytic converter (11) for treating exhaust gas pollutants from an internal combustion engine during warm-up comprises a housing (13) which defines an exhaust gas receiving chamber (15), an exhaust gas inlet (17) in one end of the housing and an exhaust gas outlet (19) at the other end of the housing, a hollow catalyst structure (23) having discrete channels or pores secured in the chamber spaced from the walls of the housing and aligned axially providing a passage (25) between the outer surface of the catalyst structure and the wall and an axial channel (27) in communication with the gas inlet and gas outlet, and valve means (41) adapted to be opened and closed in response to a predetermined condition, the valve means when in a closed position restraining exhaust gas flow in the axial channel causing the gas to flow radially through the catalyst structure into the passage and when in an open position permitting essentially unimpeded flow of gas from the gas inlet through the axial channel to the gas outlet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to catalytic converters for controlling emission levels 
from internal combustion engines. More particularly, the invention relates to an 
auxiliary catalytic converter for controlling emissions from an internal combustion 
engine during the period of engine warm-up. The greatest concentration of atmospheric contaminants from the exhaust of an 
internal combustion engine occurs immediately following start-up of the engine. 
While catalytic converters are required in the exhaust system, such converters are 
essentially ineffective in controlling pollutants until they are heated to elevated 
temperatures by the hot exhaust gases from the engine. Efforts have been made to control this problem using so called warm-up pr 
"pup converters" which are positioned near the exhaust manifold in advance of a main, 
under the floor, converter. In some embodiments, these converters are heated 
electrically. Generally, the exhaust gases are forced through honeycombed structures 
the surface of which is coated with a catalyst. While these converters do reduce 
pollutant emissions following start-up, they are power and fuel consumers. The flow 
of exhaust gases is impeded throughout the time the engine is operating. In addition 
to this inefficiency, catalyst in the converter continues to be deactivated as long as the 
engine is running. EPA 0417412 relates to the provision of auxiliary catalyst converters in the 
exhaust system of an internal combustion engine. The auxiliary converter comprises a 
catalyst mass having an axial channel therethrough. Flow of exhaust gases through 
the channel is controlled by a valve. In its open position, the valve exhaust gases bypass 
the catalyst. When the valve is closed, exhaust gases must pass axially through 
the catalyst mass. An object of the present invention is to provide an auxiliary catalytic converter 
for an internal combustion engine which achieves rapid catalytic activity without 
substantial operating pressure and power losses associated with known warm-up 
converter systems. The system utilizes a radial flow catalyst system which is placed 
adjacent or as a part of the exhaust manifold at the coition or "Y" where the cylinder 
exhaust tubes come together. According to the present invention there is provided a catalytic converter for 
treating exhaust gas pollutants from an internal combustion engine during engine 
warm-up comprising 
(a) a housing (13) having walls defining an exhaust gas receiving 
chamber (15), an exhaust gas inlet (17) at one

A catalytic converter for treating exhaust gas pollutants from an internal 
combustion engine during engine warm-up comprising 


(a) a housing (13) having walls defining an exhaust gas receiving 
chamber (15), an exhaust gas inlet (17) at one end of said housing and an exhaust gas 

outlet (19) at the other end of said housing, 
(b) catalyst holding means (21) disposed in said chamber, 
(c) an annular catalyst structure (23) having multiple channels or 
pores throughout said structure secured by said holding means, said structure being 

axially aligned in said chamber and having an axial channel (27) in communication with 
said exhaust gas inlet and said gas outlet, and 
(d) valve means (41) adjacent said gas outlet adapted to be opened 
and closed in response to a predetermined condition within the converter, characterised

wherein said catalyst structure is a reticulated hollow cartridge (23) having multiple 

channels or pores to permit exhaust gases to flow therethrough.
