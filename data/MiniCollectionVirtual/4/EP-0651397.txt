<ABSTRACT>
A method for reducing corrosion of stainless steel 
components in a water-cooled nuclear reactor. A compound 

containing a platinum group metal, e.g., palladium, 
is injected into the water of the reactor in the 

form of a solution or suspension. This compound has the 
property that it decomposes under reactor thermal conditions 

to release ions/atoms of the platinum group metal 
which incorporate in or deposit on the oxide film formed 

on the stainless steel reactor components. The compound 
may be organic, organometallic (e.g., palladium acetylacetonate) 

or inorganic in nature.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to reducing the corrosion 
potential of components exposed to high-temperature 
water. As used herein, the term "high-temperature 
water" means water having a temperature of about 150°C 
or greater, steam, or the condensate thereof. High-temperature 
water can be found in a variety of known 
apparatus, such as water deaerators, nuclear reactors, 
and steam-driven power plants. Nuclear reactors are used in central-station 
electric power generation, research and propulsion. A 
reactor pressure vessel contains the reactor coolant, 
i.e. water, which removes heat from the nuclear core. 
Respective piping circuits carry the heated water or 
steam to the steam generators or turbines and carry 
circulated water or feedwater back to the vessel. 
Operating pressures and temperatures for the reactor 
pressure vessel are about 7 MPa and 288°C for a boiling 
water reactor (BWR), and about 15 MPa and 320°C for a 
pressurized water reactor (PWR). The materials used in 
both BWRs and PWRs must withstand various loading, 
environmental and radiation conditions. Some of the materials exposed to high-temperature 
water include carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless 
steel, and nickel-based, cobalt-based and zirconium-based 
alloys. Despite careful selection and treatment 
of these materials for use in water reactors, corrosion  
 
occurs on the materials exposed to the high-temperature 
water. Such corrosion contributes to a variety of problems, 
e.g., stress corrosion cracking, crevice corrosion, 
erosion corrosion, sticking of pressure relief 
valves and buildup of the gamma radiation-emitting Co-60 
isotope. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is a known phenomenon 
occurring in reactor components, such as structural 
members, piping, fasteners, and welds, exposed to 
high-temperature water. As used herein, SCC refers to 
cracking propagated by static or dynamic tensile stressing 
in combination with corrosion at the crack tip. The 
reactor components are subject to a variety of stresses 
associated with, e.g., differences in thermal expansion, 
the operating pressure needed for the containment of the 
reactor cooling water, and other sources such as residual 
stress from welding, cold working and other asymmetric 
metal treatments. In addition, water chemistry, 
welding, heat treatment, and radiation can increase the 
susceptibility of metal in a component to SCC. It is well known that SCC occurs at higher rates 
when oxygen is present in the reactor water in concentrations 
of about 5 ppb or
