<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a balloon that can 
dispense medications in a predetermined location within a 
bodily organ and especially relates to a balloon catheter 
which can simultaneously provide forcible expansion of the 
cross section of a coronary artery that has been narrowed 
by atherosclerotic lesion or stenosis and also dispense a 
medication to the site that has been forcibly expanded. 
In particular, the medication dispensing balloon of the 
present invention is disposed at the distal end of a 
catheter shaft having a plurality of lumens therein. The 
balloon not only forcibly expands the cross section of the 
coronary artery but also can simultaneously deliver a 
dosage of medication at the site of the expansion thereby 
to avoid injecting large quantities of the medications 
intravenously when only a small site needs to be treated. 
Moreover, the present invention relates to a inflatable 
medical device in which the wall of the balloon serves 
both as the containment mechanism for the inflation fluid 
and also as the dispensing vehicle for medications. Balloon catheters for expanding atherosclerotic lesions 
or stenosises are well known in the art. Such devices 
include an inflatable balloon disposed at the end of a 
multi-lumen catheter shaft in which a pressurizing fluid 
is forced into the balloon to expand it and the expansion 
of the balloon engages the surface of the artery to 
enlarge its cross section. Such balloons, however, have 
not provided a means to dispense medications at the site 
of the lesion or stenosis but rather have relied upon 
either injecting massive doses of drugs intravenously or 
withdrawal of the balloon catheter and reinsertion of 
another catheter into the patient's arterial system to 
administer the medication.  
 The United States patent 5,049,132 to Shaffer et al 
describes a doubled walled balloon catheter in which one 
balloon is inflated to enlarge the artery and a circumferentially 
disposed second balloon is filled with a medication. 
The inside balloon is aperture-free and is mounted 
on a catheter shaft and receives inflation media from an 
inflation lumen in the catheter shaft. A second lumen is 
spaced from the first lumen and is carried by the catheter 
shaft also. A second balloon is mounted on the catheter 
shaft in communication with the second lumen and a large 
number of tiny apertures are formed in it. Upon application 
of significant pressure, the medications will flow 
through the apertures thereby providing for the administration 
of

<CLAIMS>
An inflatable medical device for intervascular delivery of 
medications, said device comprising: 


an inflatable balloon (16) defined by walls and adapted to receive 
inflation fluids; 
means (22) to inflate said balloon (16); 
means (28) to deliver medications to said balloon (16); and 
means (17) to dispense medications from said balloon (16) to said 
vascular system;
  
 

characterised in that the balloon (16) further comprises: 

an array of conduits (40) disposed within the walls of said balloon 
(16), said conduits (40) extending substantially the entire length of said 

balloon (16), said conduits (40) being adapted to deliver medications to 
predetermined locations within a vascular system. 
The medical device according to claim 1 wherein said conduits (40) 
are arranged around said balloon (16) within said walls, said conduits (40) 

being spaced from each other on said balloon (16) and individually 
segregated from each other so as not to be in fluid flow relationship with 

each other. 
The medical device according to claim 1 further including a 
catheter shaft (14) having at least two lumens (22, 28), one of said lumens 

(28) being in fluid flow relation with conduits (40) adapted to deliver 
medications. 
The medical device according to claim 3 wherein another of said 
lumens (22) is in fluid flow relation with the interior of said balloon (16), 

whereby to provide the interior of said balloon (16) with inflation fluids.  
 
The medical device according to claim 1 wherein said dispensing 
means (17) are disposed on the outer surfaces of each of said conduits 

(40). 
The medical device according to claim 5 wherein said dispensing 
means (17) includes perforations on said conduits (40). 
The medical device according to claim 1 wherein said conduits (40) 
are imperforate over their lengths and terminate in apertures (17) disposed 

at distal ends thereof whereby to provide egress for medications from said 
balloon (16). 
A method of making a medication-dispensing balloon (16) for a 
catheter, said method comprising: 


co-extruding two dissimilar plastic materials, one portion of the 
extrusions forming a tube and the other portion of said extrusion being 

disposed within said tube as a segregated array of strands, said strands 
being individually enclosed within the tube; 
withdrawing said strands from said tube whereby to form conduits 
(40) within said tube. 
A method according to claim 8 wherein the plastic forming said 
strands is either high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene or polyethylene 

copolymers extruded with polyethylene terapthalate forming said tube or Nylon extruded 
with high density polyethylene forming said tubes. 
A method according to claim 9 wherein the wall thickness of the 
extruded tube is between 0.05 and 3.75 mm and the diameter of the 

strands is between about 0.0125 and 2.5 mm.
