<ABSTRACT>
Internal combustion engine air/fuel ratio 
regulation in which closed-loop air/fuel ratio control 

responsive to a pre-converter oxygen sensor (22) 
feedback signal is further regulated in accordance 

with a feedback signal from a post-converter oxygen 
sensor (24) signal operative under certain engine 

operating conditions to provide an average actual 
engine air/fuel ratio signal. A pre-converter oxygen 

sensor rich/lean threshold is adjusted in accordance 
with the post-converter signal to drive or maintain 

such post-converter signal within a preferred range 
corresponding to an average engine air/fuel ratio of 

stoichiometry.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and
regulator for regulating the air/fuel ratio of an
internal combustion engine.It is generally known that the amount of
hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen
emitted during operation of an internal combustion
engine may be substantially reduced by controlling the
relative proportion of air and fuel (air/fuel ratio)
admitted to the engine, and by catalytically treating
the engine exhaust gas. A desirable air/fuel ratio is
the stoichiometric ratio, which is known to support
efficient engine emissions reduction through the
catalytic treatment process. Even minor deviations
from the stoichiometric ratio can lead to significant
degradation in catalytic treatment efficiency.
Therefore, it is important that the air/fuel ratio be
precisely regulated so as to maintain the actual
engine air/fuel ratio at the stoichiometric ratio.Closed-loop control of internal combustion
engine air/fuel ratio has been used to drive the
actual air/fuel ratio towards a desired air/fuel
ratio, such as the stoichiometric air/fuel ratio.
This control benefits from an estimate of actual
engine air/fuel ratio, such as from an output signal
of an oxygen sensor disposed in the engine exhaust gas
path. The estimate is applied to a control function
responsive to air/fuel ratio error, which is the
difference between the estimate and the desired
air/fuel ratio.The oxygen sensor may be a conventional
zirconia oxide ZrO2 sensor which provides a high gain,
substantially linear measurement of the oxygen content
in the engine exhaust gas. A lean engine air/fuel
ratio corresponds to a ZrO2 sensor output signal below 
a predetermined low threshold voltage and a rich
engine air/fuel ratio corresponds to an output signal
above a predetermined high threshold voltage.ZrO2 sensors are disposed in the exhaust gas
path in position to measure the oxygen content of the
engine exhaust gas, such as upstream of the catalytic
treatment device (catalytic converter). Such
pre-converter sensors have contributed to an increase
in engine emissions efficiency. However, certain
effects, such as sensor or converter ageing (catalyst
depletion) and sensor contamination may degrade
emission reduction efficiency and may be left
uncompensated in traditional closed-loop control.ZrO2 sensors may also be positioned in the
engine exhaust gas path downstream from the catalytic
converter. For example, post-converter sensors have
been used for converter diagnostics or for outright
engine air/fuel ratio control. US-A-4622809
