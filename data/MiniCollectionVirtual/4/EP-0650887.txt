<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electrically assisted pedal 
operated vehicle, in particular a bicycle, comprising a human 

power drive system and an electrical drive system provided in 
parallel to each other, wherein an output of the electric drive 

system is controlled in compliance with changes in the output of 
the human power drive system wherein a control means calculates 

target values for the amount of electrical power assist in 
response to the output of the human power drive system to 

approach the actual electric power assist to said target value 
and wherein a motor assist limiting means provides an increasing 

or decreasing the amount of power assist gradually, at said 

constant time intervals while deliminting the amount of change 
of the target values between subsequent calculations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrically assisted pedal
operated vehicle, in particular a bicycle, comprising a human
power drive system and an electrical drive system provided in
parallel to each other, wherein an output of said electric drive
system is controlled in compliance with changes in the output of
the human power drive system, a human power detection means and
means for detecting the variation range of the human driving
power detected.Such vehicles, for example, bicycles, which comprise a man power
drive system and an assistant electric drive system in parallel
to each other such as, for example, shown in EP-A2-0 517 224 or
shown in post-published European patent applications EP-A-0 569 954
(18.11.93) and EP-A-0 590 674 (6.4.94) usually control the output of the
electric drive system in dependency of the change in the pedal
depressing force of the man power drive system. Accordingly,
the arrangement alleviates the burden on the human effort by
increasing the electric assist motor drive force in proportion
to the magnitude of the human power such as pedal depressing
force. Thus, the detection of the actual driving conditions of
the vehicle, in particular in terms of the pedal depressing
force (or under additional consideration of the vehicle speed)
the actual driving conditions were detected to derive a target
value for the desired electrical power assist.In such a case, if the pedal force changes suddenly, the target
value of assist amount also changes largely. If the pedal force
increases suddenly, for instance, the target value of the amount
of electrical power assist also increases suddenly and
therefore, the motor current of the electric motor also
increases suddenly. As a result, a large impact is applied to
the drive system which impairs the riding comfort. Specifically
at the time of starting when the motor speed is low, the amount 
of electrical assist increases and the motor current also
increases excessively which, aside from the undesirable impact
to the drive system, also accelerates the deterioration of the
battery of the electrical driving system.Thus, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an
electrically assisted pedal operated vehicle as indicated above
wherein the amount of motor assist is prevented from changing
suddenly when a sudden change of pedal force is detected, thus
reducing impacts from being applied to the drive system,
improving the riding comfort and preventing the battery of the
electric drive system from deteriorating rapidly.In order
