<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for controlling facsimile communications is 
disclosed. A facsimile machine contains a plurality of display screens containing 

step-by step instructions allowing a user to use complex facsimile functions. The 
facsimile machine contains a phonebook containing information, including facsimile 

telephone numbers, for a plurality of remote facsimile machines. The facsimile 
machine can detect the facsimile telephone number and name of a remote facsimile 

machine sending an incoming facsimile message and store the information about the 
remote facsimile machine in the phonebook. The facsimile machine can be 

configured to ignore incoming facsimile messages from remote facsimile machine not 
listed in the phonebook. Similarly, the facsimile machine can be configured to permit 

outgoing facsimile messages to be transmitted only to remote facsimile machines 
listed in the phonebook. The user can display the phonebook on a display and select 

information associated with a remote facsimile machine, and the facsimile machine 
will determine the facsimile telephone number from the selected information using the 

phonebook. The user can also group a set a remote facsimile machine together so that 
an outgoing facsimile message can be specified as going to any one of the remote 

facsimile machines in the group, and the facsimile machine will send the outgoing 
facsimile message to all members of the group.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates generally to a user interface for an 
intelligent facsimile machine (IFAX) and, more specifically, to a system and 
method for controlling user interaction with the IFAX. The modern workplace has become increasingly dependent on 
electronic devices. Machines such as photocopiers, computers, modems, and 
facsimiles are now considered essential tools for the office. Many of these tools 
are extremely sophisticated, which can make them difficult to use. The increased 
capability of these tools has often outpaced the ability of the average user to 
efficiently operate them. For example, an old style facsimile (FAX) machine had few 
options and was relatively easy to operate. Early FAX machines used an 
acoustical modem to couple the FAX signal to a standard telephone handset. 
The person sending a facsimile message simply dialed the FAX telephone 
number of the recipient and plugged the telephone handset into the acoustical 
modem when they heard an audible tone generated by the recipient's FAX 
machine over the handset. The FAX machine was easy to use, but had few or no 
options. More modem IFAX machines have direct telephone lines as well 
as a long list of sophisticated options. For example, the user can elect to send a 
facsimile message immediately, or delay transmission to a later time at which it 
is automatically sent, such as at nighttime when the telephone rates decrease. 
The facsimile message is read by the IFAX and a digital image of the message is 
stored in memory within the IFAX until the designated transmission time. With another option, the user may elect to send a facsimile 
message to a group of recipients that can be specified by a group identifier. The 
IFAX stores a list of facsimile telephone numbers, sometimes called addresses, 
and can be programmed to recognize various groups. The user need only 
provide the IFAX with the instruction to send a facsimile message to a group, 
such as "Sales Managers", for example, and the IFAX will automatically send  
 
the facsimile message to each facsimile telephone number associated with the 
group of sales managers. Numerous other features such as speed dialing, automatic 
redialing, confidential facsimile transmission and reception, facsimile 
forwarding, facsimile relaying and facsimile polling are now available on 
modern IFAXs. One problem with the advanced technological features of the 
modern IFAX is that they are difficult for the average user utilize without 
extensive training. Further, once learned, if a new
