<ABSTRACT>
A medical instrument (1), such as oxygenators and cardiotomy 
reservoirs, comprising a blood-contact surface 

formed of a hydrophobic material has a nontoxic, 
biocompatible surface active defoaming agent durably 

deposited onto said blood-contact surface, wherein said 
surface active defoaming agent is a primary alkoxylated 

alcohol, such as block copolymer of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide, 
and has a blood defoaming screen test blood foam 

filter bypass grade of 2 or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of medical devices,
specifically defoaming components for extracorporeal blood
processing devices such as oxygenators and cardiotomy reservoirs.Blood processing apparatus including oxygenators, cardiotomy
reservoirs and defoamers, blood filters, autotransfusion devices,
drip chambers, and other devices through which blood is moved,
e.g., by pumping, often require agitation such that air is mixed
with blood, causing foaming. This foam must be removed before
the blood is put into the patient's circulatory system.Many surfactants are used as industrial antifoaming agents
including selected block copolymer polyol surfactants, polyether
block copolymers, polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters and silicone-based
surfactants. These surfactants are generally used as
defoamers by mixing them into the liquid to be defoamed.Tween 80 (ICI Specialty Chemicals, see ICI product
literature) is a well-known industrial and biological surfactant
which is a polyoxyethylene sorbitan ester. Tween 80 has been
used as a debubbling agent in blood-containing medical devices. Block copolymer polyol surfactants composed of ethylene
oxide and propylene oxide are used as defoamers and antifoamers
in a wide variety of applications such as industrial processing,
latex paints, cleaning, water treatment and fermentation.
Currently two groups of polyol surfactants are commercially
available. These are Pluronic, Pluronic-R, Tetronic, Tetronic-R
and Plurofac surfactants (BASF product literature 1989). Polyols
with various structures and molecular lengths can be synthesized
by altering the reaction sequences and degree of polymerization
with or without adding ethylenediamine coupling agent. Block
copolymers composed of ethylene oxide are hydrophilic while those
composed of propylene oxide are hydrophobic. These polyol
surfactants have not been known to be applied as
defoamers/antifoamers in blood-contacting medical devices
especially for use in extracorporeal circulation.Antifoam A, Dow Corning Corporation, Midland, MI (Dow
Corning Product Literature, 1985), a polydimethylsiloxane
surfactant, has been used as an antifoaming agent for blood
processing devices. Dow Corning also manufactures a similar
polydimethylsiloxane defoaming agent sold under the trademark
Simethicone which may be used in blood processing devices.
Antifoam A is coated on blood-contact surfaces of such devices
to prevent foaming. Device surfaces are usually coated by
dipping them in a solution of Antifoam A in a halogenated
hydrocarbon. Generally,
