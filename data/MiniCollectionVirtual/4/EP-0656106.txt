<ABSTRACT>
A stand for a camera consists of a tripod which pivotally supports a camera mounting pillar (8). The camera mounting pillar (8) is formed with a pivoting lockable joint (18) which allows the camera to be positioned with a greater amount of flexibility at levels close to the ground than is possible with just a ball joint. The camera mounting column (8) and one of the tripod legs can be separated from the stand and joined together to form a monopod which can be folded about the pivoting joint (18) for compact carriage.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Angle Head TripodThis invention relates to tripods, and particularly to tripods for photographic use. It is particularly, although not exclusively applicable to tripods of the kind having a mounting head with an arcuate bolt carrying an article supporting bracket for mounting, and a plurality of wedge shaped spaces between the pivots at the top ends of the tripod legs. A tripod of this kind is described in our International Patent Application No. PCT/GB 91/01404, which relates to a tripod having a head with a slidable, article supporting pillar or centre column mounted on the head in a pillar guide which includes a pivotal bracket for attachment to the arcuate bolt, so that the pillar can be pivoted from a vertical to a horizontal position.In normal use, a camera will be mounted on a tripod bush at one end of the centre column, by means of a ball and socket head, and thus, if the column is pivoted to a horizontal position, and the tripod legs are opened to a wide angle, it is possible to arrange the camera to be positioned close to the -ground for "low angle" shoots. However, manipulation of the ball and socket head becomes very difficult in such positions, because in general, when the axis of ball and socket head is horizontal and its mounting is turned through 90°, i.e., so that the tripod bush is vertical, there is almost no further adjustability 

 of position available from the ball and socket head.Accordingly, the present invention seeks to provide a stand for a camera comprising a ground engageable support structure capable of supporting a pivotally mounted camera mounting pillar, a camera mounting member capable of being mounted on an end of said camera mounting pillar to mount a camera, characterised in that the camera nounting pillar is formed of two elongate members joined by a lockable pivoting joint.Because the mounting pillar is jointed near the or each end upon which the camera is to be mounted, the end portion can be turned to a position in which it is at right angles to the axis of the other portion of the mounting pillar. In one embodiment, the or each end of the mounting pillar is provided with two mounting attachments, such as tripod screws of a known type, one of which projects axially from the end of the mounting pillar, whilst the other projects at right angles to it.Preferably the portions of the mounting pillar are separable and the tripod is provided with at least one detachable leg which is adapted to be _attached to one of -the_ separable portions of the mounting pillar so

Claims
1. A stand for a camera comprising a ground engageable support structure capable of supporting a pivotally mounted camera mounting pillar (8) , a camera mounting member (10) capable of being mounted on an end of said camera mounting pillar (8) to mount a camera, characterised in that the camera mounting pillar (8) is formed of two tubular members joined by a lockable pivoting joint (18) .
2. A stand according to claim 2 wherein the support structure is a multi legged structure and one of said legs (22) is connected to said structure by a joint adapted to allow separation of the leg (22) so that the leg can be connected to a portion of the camera mounting pillar (8) separated from the stand to provide a monopod stand.
3. A stand according to claim 2 wherein the portion of the camera mounting column includes the lockable pivoting joint (18) , whereby the monopod stand can be folded for compact carriage.
4. A stand according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the camera mounting member (10) comprises a ball and socket head (16) . 


 5. A stand according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the camera mounting member (10) includes two mutually perpendicular camera engaging screws (12, 46), one of said screws (12) being disposed to be parallel to the axis of the portion of the mounting pillar to which the camera mounting member (10) is attached.
6. A stand according to any one of the preceding claims wherein said lockable pivoting joint comprises a pair of mutually opposed co-axial disks (34) secured together by an axially extending shaft and clamping means whereby the disks are pressed together to the lock the pivoting action .
7. A stand according to claim 6 wherein the clamping means comprises a locking screw and nut on the shaft.
8. A stand according to one of claims 6 or 7 wherein the locking action is enhanced by interengagable projections and recesses formed upon the engaging faces of the discs.
9. A stand according to any of claims 6 to 8 wherein the discs are each provided with a securing means projecting substantially tangentially from the periphery of the disc to engage with the portions of the camera mounting pillar (8) to permit 180° of pivot. 


10. A stand according to claim 9 wherein the securing means is a spigot (32) which is bifurcated to be received into a tubular mounting pillar portion (8) and expanded by the action of a screw to clamp within the tube.
11. A stand according to any one of claims 2 to 10 provided with a carrying strap (26) .
12. A stand for a camera comprising a ground engageable support structure capable of supporting a pivotally mounted camera mounting column (8) and, a camera mounting member (10) capable of being mounted on an end of said camera mounting column and having two mutually perpendicular screws (12, 46) to engage a camera one of said screws (12) being disposed to be parallel to the axis of the portion of the camera mounting column (8) to which the member can be attached.
13. A stand for a camera comprising a ground engageable tripod support structure wherein the three legs of the tripod are pivotally joined to a mounting head, each leg having a pivotable bracket (50) attached to the top end thereof said bracket providing a plate portion which is vertically orientated in use and a pivot hole extending through the plate portion of each bracket (50) being separated from the adjacent plate portion of an adjacent 


bracket (50) by a wedge shaped spacer and each plate having formed thereon a knurled surface (58) to engage a similarly knurled adjacent surface of the adjacent spacer.
14. A stand for a camera comprising a tripod support structure pivotally supporting a camera mounting pillar 8, said camera mounting pillar and one of said tripod legs (22) being separable and provided with compatible joints to permit the leg (22) to be joined to the camera mounting pillar (8) to form a monopod stand.
