<ABSTRACT>
An outboard engine structure (1) is provided 
including an engine (7) mounted in an upper portion of an 

engine body case (6), wherein an exhaust gas from the engine (7) 
is passed through an exhaust passage (15) located vertically 

within the engine body case (6), into a lower portion of the 
case and discharged into water. A catalytic converter (16) is 

positioned adjacent an oil pan (14) for said engine (7). The oil 
pan (14) is mounted in a suspended manner in an upper area 

within the engine body case and incorporated in the middle 
of the exhaust passage. The catalytic converter (16) is fixed 

to and supported on the oil pan (14). Thus, it is easy to 
place the catalytic converter (16) in the engine body case (6) and 

moreover, the temperature of a catalyst is maintained at 
a suitable level by the transfer of heat from the oil pan (14), 

thereby providing efficient catalytic action.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an outboard
engine structure detachably mounted at the stern of a boat
or ship for propelling the same, and more particularly, to
an exhaust system for an engine mounted on the outboard
engine structure.In general, an outboard engine structure is
constructed such that an engine having a crankshaft
disposed vertically therein is mounted at an uppermost
portion of an outboard engine structure body case whose
lower portion is submerged in water. An output from the
engine is transmitted to a propeller shaft through a drive
shaft provided in a suspended manner within the engine
body case to rotate the propeller, as described in, for
example, Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No.
93597/76.Exhaust gas from the engine is passed through an
exhaust passage located vertically within the engine body
case, into a lower portion of the case and discharged into
water.In such an outboard engine structure, if an
exhaust emission control catalytic converter is mounted in
an exhaust system for purification, it is difficult to
place and support the catalytic converter, because the
exhaust passage is located within the engine body case, as
described above, and the engine body case is formed into
a narrow configuration in order to reduce the underwater
resistance of the submerged portion of the engine body
case and to reduce the weight of the engine body case. However DE-A-4301 286 and DE-A-42 34 682, which form the preamble portion of claim
1, show such structure wherein such catalytic converter is directly mounted to the
underside of the engine.Engines of such outboard motors use lubricating oil which is circulated and thus need be
collected. It is helpful to mount an oil pan collecting said oil and housing a strainer also to
or near the underside of the engine, i.e. in the very restricted and limited area in the case.Thus, it is the object of the present invention to provide an outboard engine structure
allowing both oil pan and catalytic converter to be arranged in the limited area in the case
and as near as possible to the engine. To achieve the above object, according to the
present invention, there is provided an outboard engine
structure comprising an engine mounted in an upper portion
in an engine body case, wherein exhaust gas from the
engine is passed, through an exhaust passage located in a
vertical direction within the engine body case, into a
lower portion of the engine body case and is discharged
into water. The engine includes an oil pan mounted in a
suspended manner
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An outboard engine structure comprising:

(a) an engine body case (6);
(b) an engine (7) mounted in said engine body case (6)
(c) an exhaust passage means (15; 37R, 37L, 53, 59, 62) vertically oriented in
said engine body case (7) and discharging the exhaust gas into water; and
(d) a catalytic converter (16) mounted in said exhaust passage means (15; 37R,
37L, 53, 59, 62),

   characterized in that

(e) an oil pan (14) is mounted in an upper portion of said engine body case (6)
below said engine (7);
(f) said oil pan (14) and said catalytic converter (16) are positioned adjacent,
and
(g) said oil pan (14) includes an extension (14a) portion integrally formed
thereon, and said catalytic converter (16) is fixed to and supported on said

extension portion (14a).
An outboard engine structure as set forth in claim 1, wherein said exhaust passage
means includes an upstream portion (15; 37R, 37L, 53, 59) extending from said engine (7)

to said catalytic converter (16) and a downstream portion (62) extending from said
catalytic converter (16) to an exhaust opening into the water.
An outboard engine structure as set forth in claim 1 or 2, wherein the oil pan (14)
comprises a recess (61) and the catalytic converter (16) is mounted to said extension (140)

such that it is accomodated in said recess (61).
