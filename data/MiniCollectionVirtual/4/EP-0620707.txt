<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method to combat the harmful fungus growth in the paper mill processing waters, whereby bacteria belonging to the families Pseudomonas or Enterobacter, isolated from the circulation waters of the mills or from elsewhere, are added into the processing waters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a natural microbiological method for
suppressing/inhibiting the growth of harmful fungi in the paper and
process industryThe process waters used in paper
industry offer advantageous growth conditions for
micro-organisms, bacteria in particular but also for
fungi. These process waters contain nutrient
substances that are advantageous for the - growth
of micro-organisms and offer otherwise suitable
conditions for growth. The pH-value (7 to 8)
close to the neutral one favours bacterial growth, whereas the
acid is pH range (pH 5 to 6) is advantageous for fungi. The
temperature of the process waters of paper and board
machines, very often in the range of 40 to 60°C, is very
suitable for many microbes, for bacteria in particular.
The fungal growth usually stops at about 50°C or just
above.It has been observed in practice that it is possible to
produce high quality paper and board even when the
bacterial concentration of the circulating waters is
rather high (107 to 108 per ml). Microbes disturbing the
production process of paper and board may sometimes
appear in the midst of a conventional bacterial population.
Most production problems, and above all
the runnability ones, are caused by filamentous fungi and bacteria
with a tendency to form disturbing clusters. The fungi
have an important role as a factor interfering with the
runnability. Cases where the filamentous bacteria have
formed deposits (cluster frames) have been observed more rarely, so far. The filaments of fungi may accumulate a.o. fibers,
fibrils, resins, bacteria and filling materials plus
colour particles. Sometimes the clusters/deposits are slimy.
Without these filamentous "frame-builders" of clusters/deposits the productivity
of paper and board machines would be better than
today.To combat these harmful microbes causing clusters/deposits, specialty
chemicals, microbicides, are used. Unfortunately, they are efficient not only
against the harmful microbes, but also against the
microbes that do not interfere with production. Other
disadvantages of chemical microbicides are their possible
toxicity to humans and animals and their possible remnants
in paper and board.The present invention is based on the idea that the
fast-growing, harmless bacteria might be useful, from
the point of view of the control of harmful microbes as they
conquer living space from the slower growing fungi, thus
inhibiting their growth. So far, to anybody's
knowledge, there is no such chemical the
influence of which could be directed solely against
