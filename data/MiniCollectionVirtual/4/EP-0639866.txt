<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to electrochemical 
devices, and particularly electrochemical cells, for 
conversion between chemical and electrical forms of energy, 
and more particularly to fuel cells having a solid oxide 
electrolyte through which oxygen ions are conducted. Even 
more particularly, the invention relates to an air electrode 
composition having improved resistance to dimensional 
shrinkage during thermal cycling. Fuel cells and fuel cell generators in general are 
electrochemical cells to which a gaseous fuel and an 
oxidant are supplied continually and permitted to react in 
a manner that results in the production of useful direct-current 
electrical energy. For practical levels of power 
generation, low cost materials are used such as air for the 
oxidant and carbonaceous gases or coal for the fuel, 
although the fuel cell is not limited to these reactants. 
Conventional fuels are, for example, fossil fuels, naturally 
occurring gaseous hydrocarbons and fuels easily derived 
therefrom, such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide. High temperature, solid oxide electrolyte, 
electrochemical cell configurations, such as fuel cells and 
fuel cell generators, are well-known in the art, and can 
include, for example, a plurality of elongated annular 
cells having a solid electrolyte sandwiched between thin 
film electrodes. Typically, the plurality of cells are 
connected in series to provide a desired system voltage and 
in parallel to provide a desired system current. These  
 
fuel cells are made of successive layers of bonded ceramic 
materials which perform the function of support, air 
electrode, electrolyte, fuel electrode, interconnection, 
and other functions. The air electrode or cathode of the fuel cell can 
be an annular, porous member and may, for example, be 
comprised of doped and undoped oxides or mixtures of oxides 
in the perovskite family, such as LaMnO3, CaMnO3, LaNiO3, 
LaCoO3, LaCrO3, In2O3, and the like. Generally surrounding 
the outer periphery of the air electrode is a gas-tight 
solid electrolyte which is typically comprised of yttria 
stabilized zirconia, a highly oxygen-ion conductive material. 
Substantially surrounding the solid electrolyte is an 
outer, porous, fuel electrode or anode which is typically 
comprised of nickel-zirconia or cobalt-zirconia cermet. 
Both the solid electrolyte and the outer electrode are 
discontinuous to allow inclusion of an electrical interconnection 
material for series connection between cells. Many improvements to the air electrode
