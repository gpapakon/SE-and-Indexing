<ABSTRACT>
6,6'-terephthal-di(amidoperoxyhexanoic) acid is a new 
peroxyacid compound. It can be prepared by peroxidation of 

6,6'-terephthal-di(amidohexanoic) acid. Conveniently, the 
peroxidation is achieved employing a solution of 6,6'-terephthal-di(amidohexanoic) 

acid in sulphuric acid solution 
reacted with a solution of Caro's acid, the concentration of 

sulphuric acid in the reaction mixture being chosen such 
that the 6,6'-terephthal-di(amidoperoxyhexanoic) acid is 

insoluble in the reaction mixture, but that the 6,6'-terephthal-di(amidohexanoic) 
acid is soluble therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel peroxyacid as well as to a process for the preparation of peroxyacids. The detergents industry constantly seeks to improve the 
cleansing performance of its compositions, and in a effort 
to do so under low temperature washing conditions has 
investigated the incorporation of quite small amounts of 
peroxyacids. Most of the peroxyacids contemplated have been 
organic peroxycarboxylic acid compounds containing at least 
7 carbon atoms and many of them have exhibited poor 
solubility in aqueous media, a feature usually shared with 
the corresponding carboxylic acid from which they are or 
could be derived. There have been many different processes proposed for 
the manufacture of organic peroxyacids, including the poorly 
soluble ones. A number have used sulphuric acid as a main 
constituent of the reaction mixture. Parker et al in JACS 
77:4037-41 and/or JACS 79:1929-32 suggested the drop-wise 
addition of concentrated hydrogen peroxide to a sulphuric 
acid solution of a long chain aliphatic mono or dicarboxylic 
acid. Hutchins, in USP 4 119 660, discloses in 
column 1 that there are a number of problems with the Parker 
process, such as rate of peracid formation and/or small 
particle size of peracid product and accordingly, he 
suggests an alternative procedure in which the hydrogen 
peroxide and sulphuric acid reagents are premixed, and the 
solid carboxylic acid is subsequently introduced therein. 
Hutchins asserts that the acidity of his reaction mixture is 
of crucial importance, being at least 69% sulphuric acid in 
order to attain an unexpected decrease in reaction time, 
compared even with an acidity of 66.5%. Virtually the same 
procedure had been proposed nearly 20 years earlier by Krimm  
 
in USP 2 813 896, the difference being that the exemplified 
amounts of sulphuric acid were numerically lower than the 
range identified by Hutchins. Camden in USP 4 233 235 
discloses a continuous process for making similar long chain 
aliphatic peroxyacids and asserts in column 4 that batch 
processes, presumably for the same products, exhibit more 
safety problems and produce smaller crystals. In his 
process, he employs balanced continuous addition of reagents 
to and continuous withdrawal of product a constant residence 
time of his reagents in the reaction mixture. Bettle in USP 
4 314 949 discloses that in a preferred method of making 
aliphatic percarboxylic acids, particulate carboxylic acid 
is added to a peroxide/sulphuric acid mixture. Hutchins in

6,6'-terephthal-di(amidoperoxyhexanoic) 
acid. 
A process for the preparation of 6,6'-terephthaldi(amidoperoxyhexanoic) 
acid, characterised in that the 

process comprises the following process steps: 

i) In step 1, 6,6'-terephthal-di(amidohexanoic) acid is 
dissolved in concentrated aqueous sulphuric acid that 

contains no more than 25% w/w of water; 
ii) In step 2, an equilibrium mixture of Caro's acid is 
made by mixing i) hydrogen peroxide, ii) sulphuric acid 

and iii) water said mixture containing from 5 to 30% 
hydrogen peroxide, a complementary amount of sulphuric 

acid such that, in conjunction with the amount of 
sulphuric acid present in the 6,6'-terephthaldi(amidohexanoic) 

acid solution of step 1, the 
concentration of sulphuric acid in the reaction mixture 

at the end of step 3 is as defined therein, and the 
balance water, with agitation and cooling to below 50°C, 

the A value, being the weight ratio of sulphuric acid to 
the total of water plus sulphuric acid in a composition, 

for the Caro's acid solution (A2) being not greater than 
the A value of the carboxylic acid solution produced in 

step 1 (A1) or lower; 
iii) In step 3, a reaction mixture is formed by 
introducing the product of step 1 with agitation into a 

body of Caro's acid formed in step 2 and is maintained 
at a temperature in the range of from 0 to 50°C, the 

rate of introduction being controlled such that the 
6,6'-terephthal-di(amidohexanoic) acid remains entirely 

in solution before it reacts with hydrogen peroxide or 
permonosulphuric acid and the introduction is stopped no 

later than when the composition of the aqueous phase has 
reached a point selected within the ranges for i), ii) 

and iii) of 3 to 15% hydrogen peroxide, 55 to 80% 
sulphuric acid, and the balance being at least 10%  

 
water, with the consequence that the A value of the 

aqueous phase of the reaction mixture in step 3 remains 
constant or increases as the 6,6'-terephthaldi(amidohexanoic) 

acid solution is introduced therein; 
iv) Solid 6,6'-terephthal-di(amidoperoxyhexanoic) acid 
product produced during step 3 is separated from aqueous 

phase and retained as product. 
A process according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the concentration of sulphuric acid in the Caro's acid 

solution is selected within the range of from 5 to 70% 
w/w. 
A process according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the concentration of sulphuric acid in the Caro's acid 

solution is selected within the range of from 35 to 65% 
w/w. 
A process according to any one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that the reaction mixture produced by 

the addition of all of the 6,6'-terephthaldi(amidohexanoic) 
acid solution into the Caro's acid 

solution has an A value of from 0.6 to 0.75. 
A process according to any one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the temperature of the 

reaction mixture in step iii) is from 15 to 35°C. 
A process according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the 6,6'-terephthal-di(amidohexanoic) acid solution is 

introduced into the Caro's acid solution over a period 
selected from 30 to 90 minutes.
