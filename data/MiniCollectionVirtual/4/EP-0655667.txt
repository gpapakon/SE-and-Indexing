<ABSTRACT>
Method of rapidly making castings, comprising: 
designing a computer graphic model of the casting; 

sectioning the graphic model into graphic members which are 
at least one of blocks and slabs; carving a solid member for 

each of the graphic members, the solid members being (i) 
constituted of a meltable or evaporative solid material 

(i.e. wax or polystyrene), (ii) proportional to and 
enveloping its corresponding graphic member, and the carving 

being carried out by accessing two or more sides of each 
solid member to at least essentially duplicate the 

corresponding graphic member; forming a mould around the 
pattern, and casting metal within the mould while removing 

the pattern from such mould either by evaporation during 
pouring of the molten metal thereinto or by melting prior 

thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to manufacturing and
shaping of parts constituted of reasonably rigid material,
and more particularly to rapid pattern formations by
sectioned object machining which facilitates casting of such
pattern.It is becoming paramount that casting patterns and
their associated tools be fabricated faster in free-form, at
lower cost, have superior surface finish and require little
or no remachining. Although there is no technology that is
directed solely to rapid making of consumable patterns the
technology that is relevant to these objectives falls into
generally four categories: extruding, spraying, curing and
laminate forming. Each has significant disadvantages that
fail to meet all of the objectives.Extrusion uses a heated nozzle to extrude hot wax or
other polymer filaments, such as nylon, into a shape. It is
limited to patterning of simple shapes; it is fragile,
subject to delamination, and is expensive.Spraying can be either (i) an emulsion type where a
binder is sprayed onto a metal powder which is subsequently
laser sintered, or (ii) thermally sprayed at high
temperature using a metal powder to produce a shape.
Spraying is expensive, slow and produces a mediocre surface
finish which is porous.Curing, often times referred to as stereo
lithography, involves subjecting photo-sensitive polymer
resins in thin layers to a laser beam for curing and thence
repeating such steps to build up a part or pattern. It is
generally slow, useful only for nonmetals and tooling, and
requires expensive emission control measures because of the
odorous materials. It also demands post machining because
the surface is not stable during storage, is somewhat
brittle, and is size limited. Prior art laminate forming involves cutting of
metal plies, paper, plastic sheets or foam, by use of a
laser beam, hot wire or mechanical cutter to make
sheet-like cutouts; the cutouts are subsequently
assembled to form a unit. Laminate forming first was
carried out without a computer graphic guide, the
cutter following a mechanical guide. More recently,
the prior art has programmed the cutter to follow a
computer model or graphic, such as shown in U.S. Patent
4,675,825. The latter type of laminate forming has
been used to shape metal but fails to eliminate post-machining
of the unit, lacks high structural integrity
because of the need to use very thin laminates, is
incapable of making complex parts such as intricate
engine cylinder heads, manifolds or engine blocks, and
is slow due to the high number of handling

<CLAIMS>
A method of rapidly making a casting,
comprising:


(a) designing a computer graphic model (10) of
the product;
(b) sectioning the graphic model (10) into
graphic members (34-38, Fig. 6) which are at least

one of blocks and slabs:
(c) carving a solid member (34-38) for each of
the graphic members, the solid members being (i)

constituted of a meltable or evaporative solid
material, (ii) proportional to and enveloping its

corresponding graphic member, and said carving being
carried out by accessing two or more sides of each

solid member to at least essentially duplicate the
corresponding graphic member;
(d) securing the carved solid member (34-38)
together to replicate the graphic model (10) and

form a unitary investment pattern;
(e) forming a mould around said pattern, and
(f) casting metal within said mould while
removing the pattern from such mould either by

evaporation during pouring of the molten metal there
into or by melting prior thereto.
A method as claimed in claim 1, in which
said pattern is formed of wax.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in
which during step (e), the pattern is dipped into a

slurry consisting of ceramic flour and colloidal
silica, and then the coated pattern is sprinkled with

fine grained sand.
A method as claimed in claim 1, in which 
wax is used as the solid member material, the pattern

being removed from the mould by heating prior to
casting to melt and drain the wax therefrom.
A method as claimed in claim 1, in which
said pattern is formed of polystyrene foam.
A method as claimed in claim 5, in which
during step (e), dry unbonded sand is introduced around

said pattern and vibrated to form a compacted sand
mould with interstices between the sand grains.
A method as claimed in claim 6, in which
said polystyrene pattern is removed from said sand

mould by evaporation into a gas when molten metal is
poured into said mould, the evaporated gas migrating

into the interstices of the sand mould.
A method as claimed in claim 7, in which
the resultant casting is of production quality when

made in volumes of 100 or less.
A method as claimed in claim 5, in which
the resultant casting is prototype quality.
