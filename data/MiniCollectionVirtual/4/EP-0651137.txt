<ABSTRACT>
Turbomachine including means for heating internal parts (12) of turbine discs during increases in speed in order to reduce the thermal gradient across the discs. Heating gas passes through ducts (11) integral with the stator and heats up the discs, passing over a seal (13) designed with wipers (18) and orifices (20 and 22) which allow the gas to circulate towards the zones to be heated up when the increase in speed has first of all heated up the portions of the machine close to the ducts (11), and then interrupt the communication when the temperatures have equalised and the expansions of thermal origin become uniform and offset the orifices (20 and 23). Application to aircraft engine turbo machines.

<CLAIMS>
Turbomachine comprising a rotor (1), a stator 
(2), a combustion chamber (4) upstream of a turbine (7) 

belonging to the rotor (1) and consisting in part of a 
disc and comprising a passage for communication and 

blowing hot gas from a tapping-off region (4, 457) of the 
turbomachine towards a central
 region of the disc, the 
communication passage being composed of a duct (11, 411, 

458) that opens into the tapping-off region and is an 
integral part of the stator (2), and of a chamber (21, 

121, 28, 128, 228, 33, 460, 560, 660, 760) that is an 
integral part of the rotor (1), the duct and chamber 

being joined by an annular assembly comprising concentric 
closure walls (17, 22), the walls being, however, perforated 

with orifices (20, 23), the turbomachine being 
characterized in that one (17) of the walls has circular 

and parallel peaks (18) formed on the said wall and 
standing out towards the other wall (22) that they 

practically touch and delimiting grooves (19), some of 
which have no orifices, the orifices (23) of the other of 

the walls or plate (22) being situated in such a way that 
depending on the differential thermal expansions in the 

turbomachine at various operating speeds, they open 
either into the grooves (19) that have no orifices, for 

some of the speeds, or into the grooves that have orifices 
(20) for other speeds. 
Turbomachine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the other wall (21) is covered with erodable 

material opposite the peaks (18). 
Turbomachine according to either one of Claims 1  
 

and 2, characterized in that the chamber of the communication 
passage that belongs to the rotor is equipped, 

facing the central region of the turbine disc (7), with 
means (24, 25, 124, 330) for making the gas flow turbulent. 
Turbomachine according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the means consist of reliefs (24, 124, 330) 

situated on the said central region. 
Turbomachine according to either one of Claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that the chamber of the communication 

passage that belongs to the rotor is equipped, 
facing the said central region, with means (224) for 

deflecting the gases towards the blowing region. 
Turbomachine according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the means consist of a perforated plate close to 

the said central region and covering it. 
Turbomachine according to any one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the tapping-off region is a 

portion of the combustion chamber (4). 
Turbomachine according to any one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the tapping-off region is a 

nearby portion of a compressor (5 or 6) upstream of the 
combustion chamber. 
Turbomachine according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the chamber of the communication passage that is 

an integral part of the rotor comprises orifices (467, 
468) for blowing gas towards central regions of discs (6) 

of a compressor of the turbomachine. 
Turbomachine according to either one of Claims 8 
and 9, characterized in that the chamber of the communication 

passage that is an integral part of the rotor 
comprises two concentric cowlings (461, 462, 561, 562, 

661, 662, 762) between which the communication passage is 
annular. 
Turbomachine according to Claim 10, characterized 
in that the cowling (562) that surrounds the other 

cowling (561) extends as far as the central region of the 
turbine disc without covering it. 
Turbomachine according to Claim 10, characterized  
 

in that the cowling (462, 662, 762) that surrounds the 
other cowling (461, 661) extends beyond the central 

region of the turbine disc and is pierced (683) or perforated 
(253) facing the central region. 
Turbomachine according to Claim 12, characterized 
in that the cowling that surrounds the other cowling is 

composed of two parts (464, 465, 665, 765) that partially 
cover one another (466) and can slide one inside the 

other.
