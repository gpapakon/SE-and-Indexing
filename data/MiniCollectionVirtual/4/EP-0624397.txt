<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of
synthesis gas, or syn gas
(hydrogen and carbon monoxide), from low molecular weight
hydrocarbons, primarily methane, reacted in the presence of steam
(steam reforming process) or oxygen (partial oxidation process), or
both steam and oxygen, at high temperature within a fluidized bed of
catalyst, e.g., nickel on an alpha alumina support. Suitably,
particulate refractory inorganic oxide solids, notably alpha alumina
solids, are admixed with the catalyst, or catalysts, of the fluidized
bed as heat transfer solids to control the temperature of reaction.
Processes utilizing the admixtures of catalysts and heat transfer
solids in reacting low molecular weight hydrocarbons in the presence
of both steam and oxygen, it has been found, have provided overall
high thermal efficiencies in the production of syn gas.Certain particulate refractory inorganic oxide solids as heat
transfer materials are more resistant than others to melting and
agglomeration at the severe high temperature oxidizing and reducing
conditions encountered in fluidized bed syn gas generation processes.
These particulate refractory inorganic oxides permit substantially
isothermal reactor conditions in conducting such reactions, at least 
so long as they resist melting and agglomeration which leads to
reduced fluidization quality, gas bubbles of increased size, and
inferior mass transfer. Moreover, the mechanical strength of some
particulate solids is greater than others, and in any process the
particles must be sufficient to withstand the stress and strain of
process operations. An important pathway to loss of fluidization
relates to particle degradation through mechanical attrition and break
up of the particles to product fines. The amount of mechanical
fracturing and attrition of the particles that can be tolerated during
the operation is necessarily limited, and in any process some of the
solids particles will be swept from the bed by the ascending fluidization
gas, or gases. Whereas cyclone separators can be used to return
major concentrations of the solids particles to the bed, no cyclone
separator, or system of cyclone separators can be operated with one
hundred percent efficiency. Albeit other means may exist for obtaining
a more complete separation of particulate solids from the
effluent, the cost of such facilities are burdensome. Hence, in most
economically viable processes a significant amount of the particulate
solids escapes to the atmosphere. Make up solids must therefore be
added to the
