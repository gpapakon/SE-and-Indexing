<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for monitoring liquid levels, having a measuring sensor which detects the respective liquid level and is formed by means of a bellows filled with a gaseous filling medium, the walls of which bellows which are wetted by the liquid consist of a material which yields in the direction of the liquid pressure and are unstressed after the filling of the bellows, the bellows having an opening which is sealed off with respect to the liquid and to which at least one sensor is connected which detects the state change of the medium contained in the bellows which accompanies a change of the liquid level, and the bellows being surrounded by a housing which has at least one connecting opening through which the liquid to be monitored penetrates, and in whose upper internal space, especially in the container wall, there is a ventilating opening.
