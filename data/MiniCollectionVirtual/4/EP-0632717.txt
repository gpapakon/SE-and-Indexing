<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns the use of an agent as an anti-irritant, cosmetic
compositions comprising said agent, processes for preparing said compositions and a
method of reducing irritation of the skin.An uneasy irritating sensation or itching feeling in the upper surface of the skin is a
phenomenon affecting many people at some time, even though it does not indicate any
health problem. Said irritation or itching feeling may result from having a sensitive or
hypersensitive skin, e.g. in the case of a dry or broken skin, from exposure to light,
insect bites, contact with irritating plants such as poison ivy, friction or contact with
clothes or tissues.The present invention is concerned with the topical use as a cosmetic product of a
compound having the formula

or a cosmetically acceptable acid addition salt form thereof, for preventing or reducing
irritation or itching of the skin of human beings. The compound or formula (I), 1-[3-[4(diphenylmethyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]-1H-benzimidazole
is a known compound and its preparation as well as its properties are
described in US-3,472,854.The compound of formula (I) is preferably used as such or in a cosmetically
acceptable acid addition salt form. Said salt forms can conveniently be prepared by
treating the base form with an appropriate acid such as, for example, hydrohalic acids,
e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid; sulfuric acid; nitric acid; phosphoric acid and the
like; or organic acids, such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic,
2-hydroxy-propanoic, 2-oxopropanoic, ethanedioic, propanedioic, butanedioic,
(Z)-2-butenedioic, (E)-2-butenedioic, 2-hydroxybutanedioic, 2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic,
2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic,
benzenesulfonic, 4-methylbenzenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, 2-hydroxybenzoic,
4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic and the like acids.
The term acid addition salt form as used hereinabove also comprises the solvates which
the compound compound (I) and its acid addition salts are able to form. Examples of
such solvates are, e.g. the hydrates, alcoholates and the like.The compound of formula (I) when used in cosmetic compositions at a concentration
of 0.05% to 2% (by weight based on the total weight of said cosmetic compositions),
preferably 0.5% to 2%, prevents or takes away irritation or itching in the upper surface
of the skin. Moreover, because of the beneficial inflammation modulating properties of
compound (I), the rash and redness associated with certain instances of irritation can
