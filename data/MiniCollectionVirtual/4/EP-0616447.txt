<ABSTRACT>
2.1 For secure transmissions, encryption and decryption according to the knapsack principle are used, with two keys, one of which is public and is used for encryption and one of which is secret and is used for decryption. Due to the incorporation of a trapdoor, the mathematically difficult knapsack problem is suitable for ensuring that only a legitimate user succeeds in solving the knapsack problem for data recovery. For this purpose, on the one hand relatively secure but expensive and on the other hand simpler but also insecure solutions are known. 2.2 For a simpler and more secure solution, when the trapdoor for the public key is incorporated, the weights ci and, for the secret key, the Gaussian integer  pi  and the values xi are used, the sum c is formed for data encryption and the real component of c mod  pi  is then calculated to form a simple knapsack for recovery. 2.3 The method can be used in versatile fashion in all data transmissions, but in particular for exchange of keys by means of chip cards in which the secret key of the user is resident in the hardware in read-protected form and which are allocated by means of Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) to defined users.

Process for the secure transmission of data over insecure channels by means of encryption and
decryption of the data according to the knapsack principle, in which the users are in possession of at

least two separate keys, at least one public key for encryption and at least one secret key for
decryption, and in which user A (sender of data), using the public key of user B (receiver of data),

encrypts the data to be transmitted to B and sends the thus encrypted data to B, whereupon B recovers
the data using the secret key of B,
