<ABSTRACT>
A method for active noise reduction based on destructive interference of sound waves in order to reduce the energy in a sound field employs two omnidirectional microphones (M1, M2) provided in connection with a loudspeaker. By means of the microphones the acoustic feedback is eliminated by a closed loop consisting of the microphone and the loudspeaker. The loudspeaker used is an open loudspeaker with a dipole characteristic, thus causing one of the microphones to be more sensitive to the far field and thereby to the noise which has to be suppressed. The method is implemented by means of a device which comprises a digital signal processor for processing the microphone signals and which transmits an output signal to the loudspeaker where the feedback component from the loudspeaker is substantially eliminated, while the output signal's phase and amplitude are adjusted in such a manner that an effective cancellation of the noise is obtained in a area around the loudspeaker's near field. The digital signal processor can preferably be implemented in the form of software modules on an integrated circuit. With the method and the device an integrated reduction in noise level of almost 20 dB is achieved depending on how the filtering in the digital signal processor is adapted. In practice a quiet zone can be obtained in the loudspeaker's near field with an attenuation band which extends from approximatively 100-500 Hz.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for active noise reduction in 
a local area in accordance with the introduction of claim 1. 
The invention also concerns a device for active noise 
reduction in a local area in accordance with the introduction 
of claim 9. There is a known method of using an active noise reduction 
based on sound waves' destructive interference in order 
thereby to reduce the energy in a sound field. A so-called 
cancelling sound source is used for producing a sound field 
with the same spectrum as the sound field which is to be suppressed, 
but opposite in phase thereto. When the amplitude of 
the two sound fields is identical, the result will ideally be 
a total suppression of the sound energy by phasing it out. 
The problem is to find the cancelling sound field which 
provides optimum noise reduction or noise suppression. The 
more acoustic dimensions there are in which the sound waves 
are propagated, the more difficult this problem becomes. In 
the space domain there will always be three acoustic dimensions. By the use of active noise reduction based on destructive 
interference, the sound field which is required to be suppressed 
is detected by a special microphone arrangement, and 
after signal processing, the detected microphone signals are 
transmitted with the correct amplitude and phase to a loudspeaker 
which acts as the noise-cancelling sound source. In 
order that the noise cancellation should be effective, the 
sound which is detected by the microphone arrangement and the 
sound from the loudspeaker must be coherent, i.e. the distances 
between microphones, loudspeaker and the area in which 
the noise reduction or cancellation are to take place must be 
small. The problem is that small distances between microphone 
and loudspeaker which are connected in an electrical network 
will normally result in acoustic feedback, so-called howl.  
 For instance, US-A-5 133 017 (Cain et al.) discloses a noise 
cancellation system providing a localized zone of noise 
suppression in the vicinity of, e.g., an individual person. 
This system uses a pair of loudspeakers - one for each ear - 
and a number of microphones to obtain a cancellation signal 
which is delivered to the loudspeakers. No distinction is 
made between the near field and the far field and the system 
does not address the problem of acoustic feedback.  
 Attempts have also been made to generate a local noise-suppressed 
area or a so-called quiet zone by using a reference 
signal. If, e.g., it is a case of noise from a
