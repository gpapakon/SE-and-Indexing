<DESCRIPTION>
The
invention is directed to new pharmaceutical compositions
useful for the treatment of conditions associated with
excessive excitatory amino acid activity.In accordance with the present invention, it has been
discovered that probenecid will potentiate the activity of
the following excitatory amino acid antagonists: 
a) in the compounds of Formula Ia, X is represented by a
linear C1-4 alkylene, or S; m is an integer from 1-4; Z is
represented by H, C1-4 alkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, or
an alkylphenyl substituent in which the phenyl ring may be
optionally substituted; R is represented by hydrogen,
halogen, C1-4 alkyl, C1-4 alkoxy, CF3, OCF3, OH, NO2, or CN;
R1 and R2 are each independently represented by -OH, -OR3,
-NR4R5,-OCH2OR3, or -O-(CH2)n-NR6R7, in which n is an integer
from 1-4; R3 is represented by C1-4 alkyl, phenyl,
substituted phenyl or an alkylphenyl substituent in which
the phenyl ring may be optionally substituted; R4 and R5 are
each independently represented by hydrogen or a C1-4 alkyl;
R6 and R7 are each independently represented by hydrogen or a
C1-4 alkyl, or R6 and R7 together with the adjacent nitrogen
atom form a piperidino, morpholino, or pyrrolidino group
with the proviso that if X is a C1-4 alkylene, then m is O;b) in the compounds of Formula Ib, R, Z, and R2 are as
above, B is represented by hydrogen,
C1-C4 alkyl, optionally substituted alkylphenyl, or
-CH2-COR2; Y is SO2 or CO; and A is represented by phenyl,
substituted phenyl, or C(O)D in which D is defined as R2
above;c) in the compounds of Formula Ic, E is represented by
hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl, or -CF3; A is represented by a
methylene or a trimethylene bridging group; and E1 is
represented by hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl, cycloalkyl,
trialkylamino, alkylphenyl, phenyl, or substituted phenyl;d) in the compounds of Formula Id, E and E1 are as above,
E2 is represented by hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl, phenyl,
alkylphenyl, or cyclohexylmethyl; and 
E5 is represented by hydrogen, linear C1-C4 alkyl, or
alkylphenyl; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of any of
the compounds of Formulae Ia-d.It has been discovered that probenecid will potentiate
the therapeutic activity of the excitatory amino acid
antagonists described by Formulae Ia-Id above (hereinafter
the compounds). Thus the compounds will exhibit their
therapeutic effects at lower doses and for longer periods in
patients who are concurrently receiving probenecid. The
mechanism by which probenecid potentiates their effects is
not fully understood, however it is believed that
