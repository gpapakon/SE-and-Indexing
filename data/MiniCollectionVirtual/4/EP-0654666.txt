<ABSTRACT>
A detector for detecting flaws in object (2) to be inspected in accordance with echo signals (b) from the 
object (2). Only in a specific period (T
M
) of measurement in a pulse interval (Tâ‚€) of ultrasonic wave pulses (a), high 
frequency echo signals (b) outputted from a ultrasonic wave transceiver unit (1) are A/D converted at a high sampling 

frequency (f
S
), and provisionally stored in a storage (12). The sampling data are read out at a read-out frequency (f
R
) 
which is lower than the sampling frequency (f
S
). Only the data in this measurement period (T
M
) is subjected to digital 
signal processing to reduce noises by use of a digital filter (18) and a synchronous adding and averaging circuit (27). 

As a result, the noises contained in the echo signals (b) are significantly reduced while maintaining the on-line flaw 
detection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrasonic
inspection apparatus which transmits an ultrasonic pulse
to a target object and analyzes an echo signal detected
from the target object to detect a flaw present in the
target object and, more particularly, to a
signal processing device in
which, after a detected high-frequency echo signal is
temporarily converted into a digital signal, noise of
the digital signal is reduced.The preamble of claim 1 is based inpon the document EP-A-0 119 844.An ultrasonic inspection apparatus is usually arranged as
shown in FIG. 25. An ultrasonic transmit-receive unit 1
transmits a pulse signal at a predetermined period T0 to
a probe 3 provided to a target object 2 such as steel
material directly or through a delay material such as
water. As shown in FIG. 26, the probe 3 converts the
received pulse signal into an ultrasonic pulse a to
apply the ultrasonic pulse a to the target object 2.
The ultrasonic pulse a applied into the target object 2
is reflected by a bottom surface 2a of the target object
2 and received by the probe 3 again. The probe 3
converts the reflected wave into an electrical signal to 
transmit the electrical signal to the ultrasonic
transmit-receive unit 1. The ultrasonic transmit-receive
unit 1 amplifies the electrical signal and
transmits the amplified signal to a signal processing
device 4 as an echo signal b.The,echo signal b includes a bottom surface (B)
echo 5a corresponding to the wave reflected by the
bottom surface 2a and a flaw (F) echo 5b caused by a
flaw. In addition, a frequency f' of the ultrasonic
pulse a is determined by the thickness or the like of an
ultrasonic vibrator incorporated in the probe 3. The
frequency f of the ultrasonic pulse a used for inspection
is set to be several MHz to ten and several MHz.
Therefore, the frequency range of the signal waveforms
of the bottom surface echo 5a and the flaw echo 5b
included in the echo signal b is a wide range of 0 Hz to
ten and several MHz.The signal processing device 4 performs various
signal processes to the echo signal b received from the
ultrasonic transmit-receive unit 1, and the signal
processing device 4 displays a signal process result and
the presence/absence of a flaw on a display unit 6. In
this case, in order to perform a signal process to the
echo signal and display the echo signal, a trigger
signal c synchronized with the pulse signal is supplied
from the ultrasonic transmit-receive unit 1 to the
signal processing device 4.In the flaw inspection apparatus arranged described
above,
