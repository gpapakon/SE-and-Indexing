<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a low structure pyrogenic 
metal oxide filler is disclosed. The method involves 

subjecting pyrogenically produced metal oxide agglomerates 
and aggregates selected from silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, 

zirconium oxide, or titanium oxide to a dry milling process 
whereby the pyrogenically produced metal oxide is contacted 

in a agitating zone with an energy specific force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to low structure 
pyrogenic metal oxide fillers and to a method of producing 
such low structure pyrogenic metal oxide fillers. In a 
further aspect, the present invention also relates to 
products made from and containing the novel low structure 
pyrogenic metal oxide fillers. Hydrophilic/hydrophobic pyrogenically produced 
metallic oxides based on silicon, aluminum, zirconium and 
titanium are well known in the art. They are produced by 
various methods known in the art such as described in U.S. 
Patent 3,954,945, U.S. Patent 4,067,954, and U.S. Patent 
4,276,274. 
Also known 
from the prior art is the fact that such oxides are used as 
reinforcing fillers in many silicone RTV/HTV/LTV and 
nonsilicone based polymeric formulations such as rubbery 
polymers, sealants, caulks and adhesives. A full description 
of silicone rubber chemistry is found in U.S. Patent No. 
4,307,023 (which is incorporated by reference in its  
 
entirety, especially column 1, lines 5-30). The highest 
loadings possible are desired to obtain maximum reinforcement 
and improved physical properties including improved tensile 
strength, higher modulus, improved Shore A hardness and 
higher extrusion rates. Methods of producing hydrophobic 
pyrogenically obtained metallic oxide particulates are also 
well known in the art, as shown in U.S. Patent 4,068,024 and 
U.S. Patent 3,948,676 both assigned to the assignee herein. The current problem when using pyrogenic metallic 
oxides is their high structure, measured by DBP Absorption, 
which prevents high filler loadings and causes excessive 
viscosity build-up and low extrusion rates which makes 
formulations difficult to handle and process. "Structure" as 
it relates to fillers is a well recognized and understood 
term, see Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 
volume 4, page 638. Well known processes have been established to 
reduce particle/aggregate size and to decrease bulk density. 
However, simultaneously reducing particle size/aggregate 
size, decreasing bulk density and destructuring of 
pyrogenically produced metallic oxides is, prior to the 
present invention, an unknown process. An object of the present invention is to provide 
low structure or destructured pyrogenic hydrophilic and 
hydrophobic metallic oxides which allow for higher loadings 
in formulations whereby excessive viscosity build-up is  
 
drastically reduced, extrusion rates are significantly 
increased, and mechanical properties are improved. Such low 
structure or

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a low structure pyrogenic 
metal oxide filler comprising, subjecting pyrogenically 

produced metal oxide agglomerates and aggregates selected 
from the group consisting of silicon dioxide, zirconium oxide aluminum oxide, 

and titanium oxide to a dry milling process whereby the 
pyrogenically produced metal oxide is contacted in a 

agitating zone with an energy specific force created by the 
following conditions:
 
   agitating media bed consisting of a member selected 

from the group consisting of stainless steel, chrome steel, 
carbon steel, ceramic, aluminum oxide, tungsten carbide, 

zirconium carbide, zirconium oxide, and zirconium silicate 
whereby the metallic oxide agglomerates and aggregates are 

free to move, collide and impinge on each other, wherein the 
media is kept in constant agitation by a rotating shaft with 

protruding extensions of a length or by a rolling drum, the 
media diameter being 0,1016 to 2,54 cm (0.04 to one inch) in diameter and being 

of circular, spherical or cylindrical shape, the shaft speed 
being between 100 and 1500 rpm or the roller drum speed being 

between 30 to 120 rpm, wherein the media fills the volume of 
the agitating zone to the extent of 1/4 to 3/4 of its total 

volume and wherein the dwell time in the zone is controlled 
by the amount of time the metallic oxide remains in the media 

bed or by the number of passes through the media bed, 
evaluating the resulting product until a steady state  

 
condition is reached and wherein the lowering of the 

structure of the pyrogenic metallic oxide is a function of 
the time of compression, the amount of compressive force 

exerted on the aggregate/agglomerate particles and the 
conditions of compression.
