<ABSTRACT>
The securing device comprises sets of antivibratory bars (25, 25') interposed between sheets of tubes (24) of the bank of the steam generator, in the upper part of the bank known as the tube-bend region. The antivibratory bars (25, 25') comprise parts (25b, 25'b) which project in relation to the tube-bend region and the securing device comprises means of connecting the end parts of the antivibratory bars which comprise aligned openings. The connecting means comprise a screw (21), the head (21a) of which is intended to come to bear against a first antivibratory bar (25) and the threaded shank (21b) of which is screwed into a distance piece (22). The distance piece (22) is fixed either in a second distance piece, or in a tapped fixing element (23), via a threaded part (22b). The threaded parts (21b) of the screw and (22b) of the distance piece pass through the antivibratory bars (25, 25') through the aligned openings.

Device for antivibrational blocking of tubes of 
a heat exchanger including a bundle of tubes folded into 

a U, fixed at their ends in a tube plate arranged in 
parallel layers and whose juxtaposed bent parts opposite 

the tube plate constitute an assembly of substantially 
hemispherical shape termed the tube bend region, the 

blocking device including a set of antivibration bars 
(15, 15'; 25, 25'; 35a ... 35e) each interposed between 

the bent parts of two adjacent layers of tubes (14, 14'; 
24) of the bundle and arranged in a substantially radial 

direction of the tube bend region, so as to have one end 
outside the tube bend region, and linkage means between 

the outer end parts of the antivibration bars arranged in 
a plurality of sets of at least two bars in which the 

bars are aligned along a straight row and include aligned 
through openings (26, 26'), the linkage means (20, 20'; 

30, 30') including, for each of the sets of antivibration 
bars aligned along one row: 


a screw (21, 21'; 31, 31') having a head (21a) 
intended to bear on a first face of a first antivibration 

bar (25) at one of the ends of the row and including 
means (27) of locking in rotation with respect to the 

first antivibration bar (25) and a threaded rod (21b) 
engaged in the opening (26) of the first antivibration  

 
bar (25), so as to project on a second face of the first 

antivibration bar (25), opposite the first face, 
at least one spacer (22) having a longitudinal 
axis and a body whose length along the axis of the spacer 

is substantially equal to the separation between two 
successive bars (25, 25') of the row and including, along 

the axis of the body, a tapped opening (22a) over part of 
the length of the body, emerging at a first axial end of 

the body of the spacer (22) and a threaded rod (22b) in 
axial extension of the body, at its longitudinal end 

opposite the first end as well as an engaging surface 
(22c, 22b) on the outer surface of the body, and 
a tapped fastening element (23, 29) associated 
with a second antivibration bar (25') different from the 

first, 
 
   the threaded rod (21b) of the screw (21) having 

a screw thread allowing it to be fastened by screwing in 
the tapped opening (22a) of the spacer (22), and the 

threaded rod (22b) of the spacer (22) having an identical 
screw thread allowing it to be fastened in the tapped 

opening of the fastening element (23, 29) or in a tapped 
spacer opening (22a). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the tapped fastening element (23) is a nut screwed 

onto the threaded rod (22b) of the spacer (22), bearing 
against the second antivibration bar (25') and connected 

by welding points (28, 36) to the threaded rod (22b) of 
the spacer (22). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the tapped fastening element (29) consists of the 

through opening of the second antivibration bar which is 

made in the form of a tapped opening to allow screwing of 
the rod (22a) of the spacer (22). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that it includes at least one means of 

linking a set of more than two aligned antivibration 
bars, comprising a screw (31), at least two identical 

spacers (32a, 32b, 32c, 32d) and a tapped fastening 
element (33).  

 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the head (21a) of the screw (21) 

includes a rotational locking means consisting of a 
cavity (27) with parallel edges of a width substantially 

equal to the width of an antivibration bar (25), in which 
the first antivibration bar (25) of the set of antivibration 

bars is housed. 
Blocking device according to any one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that in addition it includes at 

least one anti-liftoff retaining bar (37) in the shape of 
a staple, including two branches each fixed at its ends 

onto a spacer 22 of a linkage means of a set of antivibration 
bars. 
Use of a blocking device according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 6, in the case of a steam generator of a 

pressurized water nuclear reactor having a tube bundle 
arranged in a network with triangular cells.
