Cuttable concrete adapted to be cut for several months
by means of conventional sculpting and cutting tools,

   characterized in that it is obtained from a mixture of
a volume V of mineral materials present essentially in the

form of crushed oolithic limestone, of a volume V1 less
than V of carbonated binder preferably lime and/or cement

based, of a volume V3 of water having a value V3 comprised
within the range (V x 30%, V x 90%) and possibly of a

filler.
Cuttable concrete according to claims 1,

   characterized in that the sum of the volumes V3 and V
of mineral material represents 50 to 90% of the total

volume V
T
 of the mixture.
Cuttable concrete according to one of claims 1 and 2,

   characterized in that the volume 1 of the binder, added
to the volume V3 of mineral materials constituted

essentially by oolithic limestones, has a value comprised
within the range (V x 20%, V x 60%).
Cuttable concrete according to one of claims 1 to 3,

   characterized in that the mixture comprises moreover
high hardness fillers of the type of corundum, silica,

nylon balls.
Cuttable concrete according to claim 4,

   characterized in that the volume V2 of high hardness
fillers added in the mixture corresponds to a value by

volume comprised within the range (V x 0%, V x 40%), V
representing the volume of oolithic limestone materials

present in the mixture.
Use of a cuttable concrete according to one of claims 1
to 5,
 
   characterized in that it is combined and/or stratified

with molding plaster and is used as a paving stone.
Use of a cuttable concrete according to one of claims 1
to 5,

   characterized in that it is used as a covering, the
volume V3 of water being equal to a volume about 40% of v,

V representing the volume of crushed oolithic limestone
materials.
Use of a cuttable concrete according to one of claims 1
to 5,

   characterized in that it is cast within coffers for the
production of supporting or self supporting frameworks, the

volume V3 of water having a value near to 70% of V, V
representing the volume of crushed oolithic limestone

materials.
Use of a cuttable concrete according to one of claims 1
to 5,

   characterized in that it forms a refractory mold for
the casting of materials to be melt cast or cold hardened.
Proces for the production of a concrete according to
one of claims 1 to 5,

   characterized in that a volume V of essentially
oolithic limestone based mineral materials is crushed, in

that there is added to this volume V :

a volume V3 of water comprised within the
range (30% x V, 80% x V),
a volume V1 of binder comprised within the
range (20% x V, 60% x V), and
a volume V2 of high hardness fillers
comprised within the range (0% x V, 40% x V).
Process for production according to claim 10,

   characterized in that the mineral materials constituted
essentially by oolithic limestones are crushed so as to 

obtain a homogenous granulometry varying from one
micrometer to several tens of millimeters.
Process for casting a concrete according to claim 1,

   characterized in that there is shaped and positioned
armature within a casting, in that the composition is cast

within the casing in excess quantity, in that the
composition is allowed to set up, in that it is demolded,

in that the upper sizes of the composition are cut by means
of conventional cutting and sculpting tools.
