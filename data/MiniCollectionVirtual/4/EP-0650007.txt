<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a pipe socket comprising two half-shells (3, 4) for single-piece pipes and those which are made up of two half-shells, so-called repair pipes, a seal (5) being provided between the pipe outer wall which is to be sealed and the socket inner wall, which seal is made of a sealing mat, which is divided at least once in the longitudinal direction of the pipe socket, preferably of an elastomer or of a high-plasticiser-formulation thermoplastic or the like, and exhibits, on its rear side, ribs (5a) which engage into corresponding depressions in the pipe-socket inner wall, and, by means of a bead (5c) integrally formed in the longitudinal side, is latched into an undercut longitudinal groove in one or both of the half-shells of the pipe socket.

<CLAIMS>
Pipe sleeve (M) made of two half-shells for one-piece pipes and for those
assembled from two half-shells (3, 4), so-called repair pipes, with a seal being

provided for between the pipe outer wall to be sealed and the inner wall of the pipe
sleeve, 
characterised in that
 the seal surrounding the pipe outer wall, made of an
elastomer or soft set thermoplast, and designed as sealing matting (5), is inserted

between the pipe outer wall to be sealed and the inner wall of the pipe sleeve, is
divided at least once in the direction of the pipe axis and is positively locked in

position with a bead (5c), also formed lengthways, in an undercut groove (3a) of one
or both half-shells (3, 4) of the pipe sleeve (M1, M2).
Pipe sleeve in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the sealing matting
(5) has a smooth inner surface (5a) facing the pipe outer wall to be sealed, and has

projecting ribs (5d) on its reverse side, said ribs engaging in corresponding
indentations on the inner wall of the pipe sleeve.
Pipe sleeve in accordance with Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that
 adjustable
contact pressure is applied to the sealing matting (5) by means of one or two

dovetailed closing wedges (6, 7).
