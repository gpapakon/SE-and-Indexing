<ABSTRACT>
For delivering multi-page printed sheets with at least one insert (3), collected to form printed products (2), at the edge located opposite the last folded edges, the printed products (2) which have been picked up at the fold side on collecting carriers (5) and have been removed from the latter, are moved on the further conveying path with the opened edge, facing a deliverer (29), for the inserts (3) being supplied in an insertable manner.

Method for loading at least one insert between multi-page 
printed sheets assembled into printed products 

on circulating gathering brackets of a gathering 
device, the said inserts being fed to the printed 

sheet at the open edge opposite the last folded edge, 
characterised in that the assembled printed sheets 

are gripped on the fold side and removed from the 
gathering brackets with at least partly separated 

lateral portions, and along the rest of their journey 
they are turned with their open edge towards a feeder 

for inserts and are conveyed past the feeder. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the printed products that are to be loaded with 

inserts are in the form of printed sheets deposited 
astride one another and stapled in the fold. 
Arrangement for implementing the method according to 
claims 1 and 2, characterised by the provision of 

gathering brackets (5) which circulate at regular 
intervals and with which are coordinated a respective 

one of a number of gripping pliers (15) which are 
affixed to a traction mechanism of a conveying device 

(14), the gripping pliers (15) gripping the printed 
products (2) at a handover point (16) formed with a 

respective circulating gathering bracket (5) and 
removing them from the gathering brackets (5) with 

the intervention of a separating device (17) inside 
the folded edge, in such a manner that along the rest 

of their journey the printed products (2), opened and 
ready to be loaded, cross more or less at right 

angles the path (27) being travelled by at least one 
insert (3) being delivered by a feeder (29). 
Arrangement according to claim 3, for loading inserts  
 

into printed products manufactured by means of a 
gather-stitcher from a plurality of printed sheets, 

characterised by the provision of gathering brackets 
(5) which circulate at regular intervals and pass 

through a stitcher (7) and with which are coordinated 

a respective one of a number of gripping pliers (15) 
which are affixed to a traction mechanism of a 

conveying device (14), the gripping pliers (15) 
gripping the printed products (2) at a handover point 

(16) formed with a respective circulating gathering 
bracket (5) and removing them from the gathering 

brackets (5) with the intervention of a separating 
device (17) inside the folded edge, in such a manner 

that along the rest of their journey the printed 
products (2), opened and ready to be loaded, cross 

the path (27) being travelled by at least one insert 
(3) being delivered by a feeder (29). 
Arrangement according to claims 3 or 4, characterised 
in that further along the line is an undershot 

conveyor section formed by a diverting axis (18) and 
crossing the path (27) being travelled by an insert 

(3). 
Arrangement according to claim 5, in which the 
gathering brackets are fastened in axially 

symmetrical manner to a hub and are in the form of a 
staple bending device (10), characterised in that the 

separator (17), which is adapted to be displaced into 
the printed products (2) at the head and foot beneath 

the fold and which is driven in the direction of 
advance, is coordinated with the gripping pliers (15) 

in the region of the handover point (16) for the 
printed products (2), which pliers extend more or 

less at a tangent to the path along which the 
gathering brackets (5) circulate.  

 
Arrangement according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the separator (17) is driven so as to circulate 

coaxially to the diverting axis (18) formed by the 
rotational axis of a diverting wheel (23). 
Arrangement according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the separator (17) is adapted to be rendered 

inoperative once the path (27) travelled by the 
inserts (3) has been crossed. 
Arrangement according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the path (27) travelled by the inserts (3) is in 

the form of an accelerating device (31). 
Arrangement according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the path (27) travelled by the inserts (3) and 

a horizontal plane extending in the diverting axis 
(18) form an acute angle in the undershot conveying 

section of the conveying device (14). 
Arrangement according to claim 5, characterised in 
that at the handover point (16) for the printed 

products (2) the traction mechanism for the gripping 
pliers (15) features an increasingly remote direction 

of movement (2) from the path along which the 
gathering brackets (5) circulate. 
Arrangement according to claim 5, characterised in 
that after the undershot conveying section the 

traction mechanism for the gripping pliers (15) 
extends more or less vertically upwards. 
Arrangement according to claim 5, characterised in 
that in the loading zone, or rather on the undershot 

conveying section, an auxiliary staple device (28) 
with a squeezing action against the sides of the 

gripping pliers (15) onto the fold of a printed  
 

product (2) is coordinated with the gripping pliers 
(15). 
Arrangement according to claim 4, characterised in 
that a driving mechanism exerting an opening action 

on the printed products (2) is coordinated with the 
separator (17).
