<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns compounds of the formulae (I) R-Y-CO-R3-CO-O-A and (Ia) R-Y-CO-R3-CO-O-CH2-A1, in which R is a hydrocarbon group which can be polymerized by a radical-initiated reaction; R3 is a single bond or straight-chain or branched-chain C1-C22 alkylene, C3-C8 cycloalkylene or C6-C14 arylene; A is the residue of a cyclic oligomeric carbohydrate less a hydroxy group in the 2- or 3- position or of a derivative of such a carbohydrate; A1 is the residue of a monomeric or straight-chain oligomeric carbohydrate less one hydroxymethyl group or of a derivative of such a carbohydrate and Y is -O-, -NH- or -N(C1-C6 alkyl). Homopolymers and copolymers of these monomers have hydrophilic, amphiphilic or hydrophobic properties, depending on their composition and can form hydrogels. The polymers can be used for instance as surfactants, thickening agents, substrate materials for biologically active agents and in the manufacture of contact lenses.
