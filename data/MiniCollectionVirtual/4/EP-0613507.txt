<DESCRIPTION>
Method and device for weaving.The present invention concerns a method for weaving, according to which at least one cloth is formed by providing at least one weft of textile between at least two webs by means of warp threads for binding or filler warps forming at least one shed and by subsequently binding this weft through the closing of the shed and the beat-up with the reed.In the known simple fabrics, in which one single cloth is formed, a weft which either contains one single thread, two threads or several threads which have been inserted in one and the same shed, is inserted in successive sheds, whereby for the shedding for the cloth to be woven warp threads are drawn at two levels.In case of single-cloth pile fabrics, loops are formed, every two revolutions, by inserting wires in a separate shed formed to this end, between the web formed by working pile threads and either of the two warp webs of the base fabric. So there are three thread webs for the formation of two sheds, one of which is a shed for textile weft and the other is a shed for the loop-forming wires.In the known so-called double pile fabrics, in which a bottom cloth and top cloth are woven and separated after the weaving - by cutting possible weave threads or pile threads stretching out from one cloth to the other - one weft is inserted alternately into the top cloth and the bottom cloth at each revolution, using the same weft inserter.Also in the special case of so-called double-woven pile fabrics with double weft insertion, two wefts are inserted, one in each of the cloths. Theoretically, there 

 are four warp thread webs, two for the top cloth, two for the bottom cloth, but which form only two distinct, useful sheds. The four webs are practically reduced to three and form two sheds for weft thread insertion, since the lower warp thread web of the top cloth and -the top warp thread web of the bottom cloth are separated by an interspace but do not form a real shed for the weft insertion. Two cloths are formed during the weaving process (double ply) . During the weaving process, the two cloths are temporarily connected to one another by pile threads which alternate between said cloths. After the weaving, these pile threads are cut by means of a knife so as to obtain two separate fabrics.According to the present state of the art, pile fabrics for carpeting or velvet in which the pile carries a design are woven on machines - either singly with wires to form loops or tufts inserted every two or three revolutions, with a base 'fabric
