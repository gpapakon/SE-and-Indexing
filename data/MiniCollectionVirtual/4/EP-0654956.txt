<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing an electric heating film 
including steps of preparing a mixture by fusing together 

metallic oxides and adding 1-10% of impurities in weight 
into said mixture, mixing and stirring well said mixture 

with a medium material at a proportion of 20-60% in weight 
to form a liquid material which is then filtered so as to 

remove undesired matters, dispose a base material into a 
heating furnace and heated for activating surface thereof, 

mixing said liquid material with air and spraying them 
into said heating furnace by means of a compressor at an 

air pressure of 2.0 kg/cm³ hence atomizing and dissolving 
said liquid material into ions, and letting said ions be 

accumulated and evenly coated on said base material 
thereby forming an electric heating film on said base 

material.

<DESCRIPTION>
It has been found that the conventional way to change 
electric energy into heat is simply achieved by passing 
electric current through an electric heater wound with 
resistance wires or a P.T.C. Nevertheless, the resistance 
wire is expensive and difficult to wind on the heater 
thereby increasing the cost of the electric heater. 
Further, such an electric heater will burn with flames in 
use hence wasting a lot of electric energy and consuming 
much oxygen. Furthermore, the electric heater will be 
oxidized and become useless after having used for a 
certain period of time. In addition, the shape of the 
electric heater is confined to a small one with regular 
surface. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention 
to provide a method of manufacturing an electric heating 
film which can obviate and mitigate the above-mentioned 
drawbacks.  This invention relates to a method of manufacturing 
an improved electric heating film. It is the primary object of the present invention to 
provide a method of manufacturing an electric heating film 
which can spray an electric heating film on a base 
material. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a method of manufacturing an electric heating film 
which is especially useful when it is required to coat an 
electric heating film on a base material with irregular 
surfaces. It is still another object of the present invention 
to provide a method of manufacturing an electric heating 
film which is relatively low in cost. It is still another object of the present invention 
to provide a method of manufacturing an electric heating 
film which has a heat efficiency of more than 90 %. It is still another object of the present invention 
to provide a method of manufacturing an electric heating  
 
film of which the thickness and/or proportion of the 
constituents can be modified in accordance with the 
required power output. It is still another object of the present invention 
to provide a method of manufacturing an electric heating 
film which is economical to carry out. It is still another object of the present invention 
to provide a method of manufacturing an electric heating 
film which is durable in use. It is still another object of the present invention 
to provide a method of manufacturing an electric heating 
film which will be rapidly cooled when the power supply is 
switched off thereby preventing accidents. Other objects and merits and a fuller understanding 
of the present invention will be obtained by those having 
ordinary skill
