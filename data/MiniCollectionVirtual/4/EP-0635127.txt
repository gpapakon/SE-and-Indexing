<ABSTRACT>
A device comprising, in a first embodiment, a light source (1) illuminating two parallel optical arms (11, 12) respectively controlled by two optical shutters (4, 6). One arm comprises a transparent cell (3) containing a substance of interest and the other guides light from the source. The light coming out of the arms is selectively applied to three colour filters (F1-F3) for filtering three wavelengths selected according to the substance of interest. Three sensors (D1-D3) are used to measure the brightness of the light passing through each filter and the measurements are combined by means of a control assembly (9). Analogue measurement sequences may be performed with an embodiment comprising three light sources and a single sensor. The device may be used, inter alia, for determining the pH of a substance.

A device for taking optical measurements of
changes occurring in a reacting substance contained in a

transparent cell (3), consisting of at least one light
source (1), a first optical branch and a second optical

branch allowing the incident light to pass selectively
through the cell (3) and outside it, an optical system

branch or the second optical branch and a selective

optical filter (F1, F2, F3) from a set of three
selective filters, the first centred on a first

wavelength corresponding to the isobestic point of the
reacting substance, the second on a wavelength in a part

of the light spectrum in which the substance is the most
sensitive and the third in another part of the spectrum

in which the substance is the least sensitive, means for
