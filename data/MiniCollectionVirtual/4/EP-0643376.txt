<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic article
surveillance systems and more particularly it concerns
novel deactivatable and reactivatable markers for use
in such systems as well as novel methods of making such
markers.It is known to electronically monitor the passage of
goods from a protected area by setting up an
interrogation zone at an exit from the protected area,
attaching special targets or markers to the goods and
detecting the presence of the targets or markers when
the goods are carried through the interrogation zone.
In magnetic type electronic article surveillance
systems, a continuous alternating magnetic
interrogation field is generated in the interrogation
zone; and when a marker is subjected to this field it
becomes driven alternately into and out of magnetic 
saturation and thereby produces characteristic
detectable disturbances of the interrogation field.
When such a disturbance is detected, the system
produces an alarm.The markers in magnetic type electronic article
surveillance systems are usually provided with
deactivation elements which comprise magnetizable
material of a substantially higher magnetic coercivity
than that of the markers. When the deactivation
elements are magnetized, they produce magnetic fields
which bias the markers into magnetic saturation to such
a degree that the magnetic interrogation fields can no
longer drive the markers into and out of saturation.
Thus the markers are rendered incapable of producing
detectable disturbances of the interrogating fields;
and the articles to which they are attached may pass
through the interrogation zone without activating an
alarm. These markers may thereafter be reactivated by
demagnetizing their respective deactivation elements.
United States Patents No. 5,146,204, No. 5,225,807 and
No. 4,623,877 describe such markers and electronic
article surveillance systems in which such markers are
used.There are two basic types of deactivatable markers
which can be used in magnetic electronic article
surveillance systems. The first type makes use of a
plurality of high coercivity magnetizable elements
which are spaced apart and distributed along the length
of the marker. These markers can be activated and
deactivated by remotely generated magnetic fields,
provided that the markers are substantially aligned
with these fields. The second type of deactivatable
marker makes use of a single elongated strip of high
coercivity material which extends along the length of
the marker. When magnetic elements capable of 
generating a series of

method comprising the steps of:

   providing an element (40, 114) of of easily

and low magnetic coercivity such that said material,
when subjected to continuous alternating magnetic

interrogation fields, will produce characteristic
detectable disturbances of those fields; and

material of said element.
A method according to claim 1, further
characterized in that said depositing is carried out by

electroplating (20) said another material onto the
surface of said element.
A method according to claim 1, further
characterized in that said depositing is carried out by

vacuum deposition (50, 56, 57, 59) of said another
material onto the surface of said element.
A method according to claim 1, further
characterized in that said depositing is carried out by

sputtering (70) said another material onto the surface of
said element.
A method according to claim 1, further
characterized in that said element is a portion of an

elongated strip (10) of said high permeability material
and wherein said another material is deposited onto

said strip. 
A method according to claim 5, further
characterized in that said elongated strip(10)is wound

on a spool (12) and is fed continuously from said spool
to a location where said depositing is carried out.
A method according to claim 6, further
characterized in that said strip is continuously wound

onto another spool (34)beyond said location.

characterized in that discrete lengths(40)are cut from

said strip (10) after said depositing.
