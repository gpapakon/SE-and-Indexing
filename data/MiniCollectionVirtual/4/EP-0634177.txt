<ABSTRACT>
An autoclave (1) and associated method for 
sterilising generally hollow articles, such as, dental 

drill handpieces (21), comprises means (17, 20) for 
passing a sterilising fluid, for example dry saturated 

steam, through a generally hollow article (21) with 
opening (22) at remote ends thereof, to sterilise the 

interior thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an autoclave for and an
associated method of sterilising handpieces for dental
drills having openings at remote ends thereof.Known autoclaves for sterilising handpieces for
dental drills comprise a closed chamber through which
a sterilising agent, such as ozone or a cleansing
fluid, can be passed or circulated and in which one or
more handpieces to be sterilized can be mounted.
During sterilisation, the sterilising agent is
supposed to sterilise all of the surfaces of the
handpieces which have been exposed to contamination
during use. However, because the pressure of the
sterilising agent is generally the same at both open
ends of the generally hollow handpieces, a
comparatively small amount of sterilising agent is
able to pass into and through the handpieces, such
that the hollow interiors thereof are not sterilised
properly. This may well result in contamination
and/or infection of a patient upon whom an improperly
sterilised handpiece is used subsequently. Such known
types of autoclave are disclosed in DE-A-3239549, EP-A-0281870
and GB-A-2136911.Further particles of tissue and broken tooth can
become clogged inside the hollow interiors of the
handpieces, whereby use of known types of autoclave is
not capable of dislodging such foreign matter, thus
resulting in an undesirable build-up of such matter
inside the handpieces, with consequential
contamination and/or infection of patients upon whom 
the supposedly cleaned and sterilised handpieces are used.Generally, the prior art autoclaves can be described as comprising: a
cylindrical body divided into a sterilising chamber and a sterilising agent
chamber; and at least one adaptor which is arranged to receive sterilising agent
from the chamber and which is arranged to receive thereon a generally hollow
dental drill handpiece to be sterilised, at the first end opening thereof, whereby,
in use, sterilising agent from the chamber can pass into, through and from the
handpiece at the second end opening thereof.A corresponding prior art method can be described generally as
comprising: providing a cylindrical body divided into a sterilising chamber and a
sterilising agent chamber; mounting a dental drill handpiece to the adaptor, at a
first end opening of the handpiece; and supplying sterilising agent from the agent
chamber to the interior of the handpiece via the adaptor and its first end opening,
to cause sterilising agent to pass through and from the handpiece at a second end
opening of the handpiece, thereby sterilising the

<CLAIMS>
An autoclave (1) for sterilising a generally hollow dental drill handpiece
(21) having a first end opening and a second end opening remote from the first

end opening, the autoclave (1) comprising:

a cylindrical body (2) comprising a sterilising chamber (3); and
at least one adaptor (20) which is arranged to receive sterilising agent and
which is arranged to receive thereon a generally hollow dental drill handpiece

(21) to be sterilised, at the first end opening thereof, whereby, in use, sterilising
agent can pass into, through and from the handpiece (21) at the second end

opening thereof,

   characterised in that:

the cylindrical body (2) further comprises a sterilising agent generation
chamber (4); and
a carrier (17) is mounted on the sterilising agent generation chamber (4)

with said at least one adaptor (20) attached to the carrier (17) in fluid
communication with the sterilising agent generation chamber (4); and
the sterilising agent generation chamber (4) is a dry saturated steam
generation chamber; and
the sterilising chamber is at a pressure above atmospheric pressure.
An autoclave (1) according to claim 1, wherein the dry saturated steam
generation chamber (4) is capable of causing the so-generated dry saturated

steam to pass through a handpiece (21) received on the carrier (17) at a pressure
sufficient to dislodge foreign matter from the interior of the handpiece (21). 
An autoclave (1) according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the adaptor (20) is
arranged so that, in use, the dry saturated steam pressure is sufficient also to

rotate the handpiece (21) about its longitudinal axis during sterilisation thereof.
An autoclave (1) according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the adaptor (20) is
arranged to receive different sizes of handpiece (21).
An autoclave (1) according to any preceding claim, wherein the adaptor
(20) is connectable to a handpiece (21) by a push-fit, screw thread or other

suitable means.
An autoclave (1) according to any preceding claim, wherein the adaptor
(20) is arranged such that pressurised, dry saturated steam can rotate any air

motor or turbine associated with the handpiece (21).
An autoclave (1) according to any preceding claim, wherein the adaptor
(20) is arranged to rotate a handpiece (21) by being rotated itself, such that, in

use, the handpiece (21) fixed thereto is also rotated.
A method of sterilising a generally hollow dental drill handpiece (21)
having a first end opening and a second end opening remote from the first end

opening, which method comprises:

providing a cylindrical body (2) comprising a sterilising chamber (3); and
mounting a dental drill handpiece (21) at its first end opening to an
adaptor (20); and
supplying sterilising agent to the interior of the handpiece (21) via the
adaptor (20) and the first end opening of the handpiece (21), to cause sterilising 

agent to pass through and from the handpiece (21) at the second end opening
thereof thereby sterilising the handpiece (21),

   characterised in that:

the first end opening of the dental drill handpiece (21) is mounted to the
adaptor (20) which is attached to a carrier (17) mounted on a sterilising agent

generation chamber (4) in communication therewith; and
the sterilising agent supplied to the interior of the handpiece (21) from
the generation chamber (4) is dry saturated steam; and
the pressure in the sterilising chamber is above atmospheric pressure.
A method according to claim 8, wherein the dry saturated steam is
supplied to the interior of the handpiece (21) at a pressure sufficient to dislodge

foreign matter therefrom.
A method according to claim 8 or 9, wherein the adaptor (20) is arranged
so that the pressure of the 

dry saturated steam is sufficient also to rotate the
handpiece (21) about its longitudinal axis during

rotation thereof.
A method according to claim 8, 9 or 10, wherein
the adaptor (20) is connected to the handpiece (21) by

a push-fit, screw thread or other suitable means.
A method according to any of claims 8 to 11,
wherein the adaptor (20) is arranged so that

pressurised dry saturated steam rotates any air motor
or turbine associated with the handpiece (21).
A method according to any of claims 8 to 12,
