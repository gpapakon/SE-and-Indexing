<ABSTRACT>
A cathodic active material comprises a mixture of graphite 
particles and electrolytic manganese dioxide particles which 

are composed of needle-like crystals having an aspect ratio ranging 
from about 2 to about 20 and an alkaline manganese dioxide cell 

is provided with a cathode prepared from the cathodic active 
material. The cathodic active material for dry cells can be 

prepared by mixing, in advance, carbon powder with manganese 
dioxide powder in a weight ratio ranging from about 1:100 to about 

15:100 and then pulverizing the resulting mixture. The novel 
cathodic active material for dry cells permits substantial 

improvement of the resulting dry cell in the high load-discharge 
quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition of electrolytic
manganese dioxide-containing cathodic active material used as
a cathodic active material for dry cells, in particular, alkaline
manganese dioxide cells as well as a method for the preparation
thereof. The present invention also relates to a dry cell which
makes use of the foregoing composition.Manganese dioxide has been used, for long, as a cathodic active
material for dry cells. Manganese dioxide products used for this
purpose can roughly be classified into three groups, i.e., natural
manganese dioxide, chemically synthesized manganese dioxide and
electrolytic manganese dioxide and are properly used depending
on purposes.Among these manganese dioxide products, electrolytic manganese
dioxide provides a dry cell which is most excellent in the
discharge quality at a high load. In addition, the ratio of dry
cells using electrolytic manganese dioxide has gradually been
increased since small dry cells having high capacities have
recently been desired along with the miniaturization of electronic
machinery and tools.There has been increased applications of a small-sized dry
cell such as the LR-6 type which can be discharged at an extremely 
high load such as discharge at a load of 1Ω.The electromotive force of the dry cell composed of
electrolytic manganese dioxide presently used reveal a substantial
drop when the cell is discharged at a load of 1Ω, which results
in a reduction of the capacity of one third the theoretical level.Many attempts have already been done for the improvement
of dry cells in the discharge quality at a high load. For instance,
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (hereunder referred to
as "J.P. KOKAI") No. Hei 02-213487 and J.P. KOKAI No. Sho 60-138085
proposes that electrolytic manganese dioxide showing excellent
properties in high load-discharge can be produced by carrying
out the electrolysis in an electrolyte in which carbon fibers
or carbon particles are suspended. In addition, J.P. KOKAI No.
Hei 05-9773 proposes that a high quality electrolytic manganese
dioxide product can be obtained by dispersing, in a manganese
electrolyte, carbon fibers, and/or graphite fibers whose surface
is covered with a film of a manganese oxide and by co-precipitating
the fibers and manganese dioxide through electrolysis to thus
obtain precipitates having a manganese dioxide content of not
less than 90% by weight. Moreover, J.P. KOKAI No. Sho 63-21224
discloses a method for preparing high quality electrolytic
manganese dioxide in which the
