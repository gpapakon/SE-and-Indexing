<ABSTRACT>
A compensation coupling comprises at least one first coupling element (1) and a second coupling element (2), which are coupled to one another and can be pivoted in at least two planes inclined relative to one another. The first coupling element (1) is provided at one end (10) with an axial hole (11) which opens towards this end (10). Provided within the axial hole (11) is an annular circumferential projection (12) which projects radially inwards from the wall (11') of the hole and the inside diameter of which is smaller than the diameter of the axial hole (11). The second coupling element (2) has an essentially cylindrical, spigot-like end portion (20), the outside diameter of which is equal to or slightly less than the inside diameter of the annular circumferential projection (12). The spigot-like end portion (20) of the second coupling element (2) engages in the axial hole (11) in the first coupling element (1), and a driver element is provided between the first coupling element (1) and the second coupling element (2). The first coupling element (1) in the region of the axial hole (11) is provided with a radial transverse hole (13). The spigot-like end portion (20) of the second coupling element (2) has a radial transverse slot (21). The driver element is designed as a driver pin (30) which passes through the transverse hole (13) and the transverse slot (21).
