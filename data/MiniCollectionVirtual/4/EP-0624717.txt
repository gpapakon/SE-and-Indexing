<ABSTRACT>
An adjuster unit is described for two camshafts (53, 54) of an internal combustion engine, adjustable differently from one another in their phase angle relative to a crankshaft (52). In V-type engines, the said adjuster unit (55), from which endless chain or belt drives (56) lead to the camshafts (53, 54), is arranged in the V space. The adjuster unit (55) is designed as a pre-assembled unit and can be flange-mounted on the end face of the internal combustion engine housing. Advantageous design embodiments of such an adjuster unit (55) are indicated.

An internal combustion engine comprising at least two camshafts (53, 54) 
disposed so as to be spatially separate from one another and a camshaft 

drive adjustment unit (55) driven by the engine crankshaft (52) whereby the 
phase angle of at least two camshafts (53, 54) relative to the crankshaft 

(52) can be varied differently from one another,
 
characterised in that at least one crankshaft (53, 54) is connected by an 

endless tension drive (56) to the drive adjustment unit (55), which is in the 
form of a pre-assembled unit and comprises a supporting bearing unit (2) 

serving as part of a casing, for a wheel (4) of the camshaft drive, and 
wherein the drive adjustment unit (55) is flange-mounted via the supporting 

bearing unit (2) to the end of the engine casing (58). 
An internal combustion engine according to claim 1 comprising two rows of 
cylinders (51a, 51b) each with an intake camshaft (53) and an exhaust 

camshaft (54),
 
characterised in that the drive adjustment unit (55) is disposed substantially 

between the cylinder rows (51a, 51b) and, starting from the drive 
adjustment unit (55), a first tension drive (56) leads to the two intake 

camshafts (53) and a second tension drive (56) leads to the two exhaust 
camshafts (54). 
An engine according to claim 1 or claim 2,
 
characterised in that the drive adjustment unit (55) comprises two 

supporting bearing units (1, 2) for wheels (3, 4, 5) of the camshaft drives 
(tension drive 56, coupled drive) and for one or more phase adjustment 

means, wherein at least the supporting bearing unit (2) at a distance from 
the engine casing (58) is secured to the engine casing (58) by stud bolts 

(57).  
 
An engine according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that the supporting bearing unit (1) facing the engine casing 

(58) is mounted directly in a centring recess (59) in the casing (58). 
An engine according to any of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that each supporting bearing unit (1, 2) bears a power take-off 

wheel (3, 4) of a camshaft drive (tension drive 56, coupled drive) 
whereas a drive wheel (5) of the drive adjustment unit (55) driven by the 

crankshaft (52) bears against the power take-off wheels (3, 4). 
An engine according to any of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the phase angle adjustment means comprises a toothed 

sleeve (7, 7a, 7b) comprising at least one helical gear (9a, 9b) and disposed 
concentrically inside the power take-off wheel (3, 4) and the drive wheel (5) 

so as to be longitudinally movable and engaging a hydraulic piston (10) 
guided in a hydraulic cylinder (12) abutting the supporting bearing unit (1, 

2). 
An engine according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that two toothed sleeves (7a, 7b) with associated hydraulic 

pistons (10) and hydraulic cylinders (12) are provided coaxially with one 
another and each co-operates with a respective power take-off wheel (3, 4). 
An engine according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that a toothed sleeve (7) co-operates with two power take-off 

wheels (3, 4) via different helical gears (9a, 9b). 
An engine according to any of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that a piston pump (15) is provided in the drive adjustment 

unit (55) for supplying the hydraulic medium required for the hydraulic piston 
or pistons (10)/ hydraulic cylinder or cylinders (12).
