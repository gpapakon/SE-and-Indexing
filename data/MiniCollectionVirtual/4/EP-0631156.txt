<ABSTRACT>
An interferometer is disclosed that is used with a frequency 
shifting phase conjugate mirror (PCM) (12), to produce a 90° 

polarization rotation, and employs only two adjustable elements: 
a specially shaped prism (16), and a beam deflector that is 

preferably a porro prism (40). The primary prism is shaped and 
oriented so that a linearally polarized input beam (4) is divided 

into ordinary (o) and extraordinary (e) subbeams (24, 26). One 
of the subbeams (26) is refracted out of the prism along a controlled 

length path, and then returned back into the prism by 
the deflector (40). The second subbeam (24) is retained within 

the prism by total internal reflection, and directed onto an 
exit path (38) that coincides with the path of the first subbeam 

(26) after its reentry into the prism (16). The recombined output 

beam (10) is directed into the PCM (12), from which it is 
reflected back into the prism (16) for a reverse pass. The 

difference in path lengths between the o and e subbeams is 
selected to produce a net 90° polarization rotation after both 

passes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to systems for rotating the
polarization of a linearly polarized beam, and more particularly
to systems that employ a bidirectional interferometric
coupler in the optical path leading to and from a frequency-shifting
phase conjugate mirror (PCM) to produce a
net polarization rotation.There are several applications in which the polarization
angle of a linearly polarized beam needs to be rotated.
Of particular concern are high power laser designs in
which an input laser beam is amplified by a system that
includes a PCM. Such systems are described in Rockwell, "A
Review of Phase-Conjugate Solid-State Lasers", IEEE Journal
of Quantum Electronics, Vol. 24, No. 6, June 1988, pages
1124-1140. In such systems the output beam is returned
along the same path as the input, but in the opposite direction.
The polarization of the output beam is rotated
90° from the linearly polarized input beam, thereby allowing
a polarizing beamsplitter to separate the low power
input from the high power output beam.A number of ways have been developed to produce a 90°
polarization rotation. One method uses a Faraday rotator, 
based upon the Faraday effect, in which certain materials
act as polarization rotators when placed in a static magnetic
field, with the sense of rotation governed by the
magnetic field direction. The direction of rotation does
not reverse when the beam direction is reversed, so that a
beam that makes two passes through a Faraday rotator in
opposite directions undergoes twice the rotation. Faraday
rotators are described in Saleh et al., Fundamentals of
Photonics, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1991, pages 223-233.Although Faraday rotators achieve acceptable and reliable
performance, they are relatively expensive, and large
aperture devices are quite large and heavy because of the
requirement for a uniform magnetic field to induce the polarization
rotation. This is particularly troublesome for
applications such as laser cutting and welding devices,
which employ a focusing head that has relatively small
weight limitations. These weight limits are difficult to
meet with a Faraday rotator.Another approach to polarization rotation uses an interferometric
output coupler (IOC) that couples a beam into
and out of a multi-pass phase conjugate amplifier chain.
It exploits the fact that a PCM that is based upon Brillouin
scattering imposes a frequency shift upon its output
beam; this frequency shift is used by the IOC to produce a
90° polarization rotation. The input beam passes through
the
