<ABSTRACT>
An OFDM demodulator comprises a quadrature frequency translator 
(23,24,26), and analog-digital converters (29,30). The demodulation is 

performed by a fast Fourier transform (EFT) unit (33). A constellation 
analyser (45) detects frequency and phase offsets in the translating 

carrier and sampling clock by analysing predetermined carriers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an OFDM synchronization
demodulation circuit, and more particularly, to an OFDM
synchronization demodulation circuit for obtaining a carrier
synchronization and a clock synchronization from information
signals.In recent years, digital modulation techniques of high
quality and high frequency utilizing efficiency have been
developed for a transmission of video or audio signale.
Particularly in the mobile radio communication, an adoption
of orthogonal frequency division multiplex (hereinafter
referred to as OFDM) modulation technique which is durable
against a multiple path interference is now under the
consideration. The OFDM is a system to disperse transmission
digital data into multiple carriers (approximately 256
through 1024 carriers) (hereinafter simply referred to as
multiple carriers) which are mutually orthogonal and to
modulate each of them.FIGURE 1 is a waveform diagram showing a typical
frequency spectrum of the OFDM modulated wave.As shown in FIGURE 1, the OFDM modulated wave is
comprised of multiple carriers and each of the carriers has
been, for instance, processed a QAM (quadrature amplitude
modulation). Frequency power spectrum of the OFDM modulated
wave in a channel has a single power spectrum waveform 
comprised of a superposition of frequency
spectra of multiple QAM modulated carriers. Further, as all
the frequency spectra of the carriers have same
characteristics and the carriers are provided at relatively
small and a same frequency interval, the waveform of the OFDM
modulated wave resembles to a white noise.By the way, the OFDM modulated wave is transmitted after
it being orthogonally modulated. The OFDM modulated wave is
obtained at a receiver section by synchronously demodulating
it. In this case, it is considered that carriers for sync
demodulation are restored by controlling oscillation output
of an oscillator by transmitted wave. However, as the
transmitted OFDM modulated wave is in a waveform resembled to
white noise, it is not possible to make frequency detuning
zero using the transmitted OFDM modulated wave. So, in a
conventional OFDM sync demodulation circuit, it has been so
designed that a frequency deviation is not generated by
improving accuracy of an oscillator as could as possible.
FIGURE 2 is a block diagram showing a conventional OFDM
modulation/demodulation system including an OFDM sync
demodulation circuit, which is discussed in "1992, Collection
of Release Scheduled Open Research Theses of NHK Technical
Research Institute", pp.
