<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an automated system for 
monitoring wildlife auditory data and recording same for 

subsequent analysis and identification. The system comprises 
one or more microphones (8) coupled to a recording apparatus 

(10) for recording wildlife vocalizations in digital format.

analyzed by means of a neural network to identify the 
respective species. The system minimizes the need for human 

intervention and subjective interpretation of the recorded 
sounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automated monitoring 
system for monitoring wildlife auditory data, thereby to 
obtain information relating to wildlife populations in a 
terrestrial environment. Prior to granting approval for proposed construction 
or development, government authorities are requiring more 
comprehensive studies on their potential impact on the 
natural environment. Consequently, the measurement of the 
effects of human intervention on the natural environment, 
particularly on populations of rare or endangered species of 
animals and on the diversity of animal species, is an 
important requirement. Currently used wildlife monitoring schemes typically 
involve experienced terrestrial biologists or surveyors  
 
entering the environment to be monitored and making first 
hand auditory and visual inspections of the terrestrial 
environment. These manual inspections may be unsatisfactory 
for several reasons. First, manual inspections are labour 
intensive, may require large numbers of individuals in order 
to cover a sufficiently representative territory of the 
environment, and may therefore be very difficult to perform; 
if sufficient resources are not available the results 
obtained may not be reliable. Second, manual inspections may require lengthy 
periods of time to complete. Typically, the environments to 
be monitored are remote from city centres and, the travelling 
time to and from the site may be substantial. At the site, 
surveyors must approach the environment with great care in 
order to avoid disrupting the terrestrial environment. Third, manual inspections are limited in their scope, 
because they are usually restricted to daylight hours and, as 
a result, nocturnal species are not generally observed. 
Animals may also be visually obscured by forest vegetation, 
and some environments such as swamps and marshes may not be 
easily accessible. Finally, the integrity of any measured data is 
subject to uncertainty and error due to the highly subjective 
nature of auditory and visual observations. Automatic monitoring systems have been developed in 
order to perform the monitoring function of surveyors. These 
systems have typically used conventional analog recorders to 
collect the animal vocalizations, or calls, from a 
representative area. However, recorders for recording long 
term terrestrial data (beyond 12 hours) at multiple sites and 
having a wide bandwidth (up to 10 kHz) are relatively 
expensive. Furthermore, the analysis of the recordings has 
to be conducted by surveyors
