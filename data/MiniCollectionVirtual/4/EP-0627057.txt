<ABSTRACT>
A swaging tool (10) for swaging an axially swaged fitting (12) for connecting tubes and pipes (14 and 16) is disclosed. The tool (10) comprises a housing (22) and a piston (34) movable in opposite axial directions within the housing (22). A first engaging member (50) in the form of a U-shaped yoke is formed on the outer surface (24) of the housing (22). A second engaging member (52), also in the form of a U-shaped yoke, is formed on the outer surface (36) of the piston (34) and is adapted to slide within slots (66) in the outer surface (24) of the housing (22). Both of these yokes (50 and 52) are configured to allow each yoke to engage a portion of the fitting (10) to swage it when the yoke of the second engaging member (52) is moved toward the yoke of the first engaging member (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a swaging tool for making
a tube connection formed by a fitting having a sleeve for
receiving a tube and a swaging ring that is moved axially
over the sleeve to apply a radial force to the sleeve that
swages the sleeve to the tube, the swaging tool comprising:
a) a housing;b) a piston movable in opposite directions with respect
to the housing;c) a first engaging member fixed against movement on
the housing; andd) a second engaging member connected for movement
with the piston, the first and the second engaging
members being adapted to effect relative axial
movement between the swaging ring and the sleeve.The invention, further, relates to a method of swaging a
fitting of the type having a sleeve for receiving a first
tube at a first end thereof and a second tube at a second end
thereof, a first swaging ring being arranged around the first
sleeve end and a second swaging ring being arranged around
the second sleeve end, axial movement of the rings over the
sleeve ends by means of a swaging tool causing the rings to
apply radial forces to the sleeve ends thereby swaging the
sleeve to the tubes.An assembly and a method of the afore-mentioned kind are
disclosed in document US-A-4 189 817.Swaged fittings have been used for many years to connect
tubes and pipes in various types of fluid systems, including
those used in the aircraft, marine, petroleum and chemical
industries. The tube ends are inserted into a fitting, usually
in the form of a cylindrical sleeve, and then the fitting
is swaged with a swaging tool to produce a fluid-tight
connection between the tubes. This swaging operation usually
is carried out by applying a radial force which radially compresses
the fitting and tubing inwardly. This radial force
may be applied directly by the swaging tool or indirectly by
a specially shaped ring which is moved axially by the swaging
tool to apply a radial force to the fitting. The invention of
the present application is directed to the latter type of
swaging tool designed for use with fittings having axially
movable swaging rings. These fittings shall be referred to as
axially swaged fittings. Typical axially swaged fittings comprise a cylindrical
sleeve having openings at opposite ends for receiving the
ends of two tubes, with a swaging ring at each end of the
sleeve. The outer surface of the sleeve and the inner surface
of the swaging ring which contact each other are shaped such
that axial movement of the swaging ring over the sleeve applies
a radial force to the sleeve
