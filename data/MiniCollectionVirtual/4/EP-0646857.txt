<ABSTRACT>
A user interface to automatically distribute information to a receiver on a network 
(2) using devices (4,5,11,13), such as printers (11) and facsimile machines (13), and communication 

channels (62; Fig.2), such as electronic mail, defined in a receiver profile (150; Fig.4). The receiver 
profile establishes the properties and mode for receipt of information for receivers on the 

network (2) and the profile is published in a network repository (105; Fig.3) for all network users 
or is accessible by selected groups or individuals on the 
network. Receivers have additional 
control over network senders by defining an information filter (62; Fig.2) which further controls 

sender channel access (to a receiver) by defining some channels (62) as having priority of access 
such as direct or delayed access, as well as selectively permitting senders to override the receiver 

profile (150; Fig.4). Consequently, receiver profiles (150; Fig.4) provide a variable receiver 
definable link to senders using multiple forms of media as well as multiple hardware platforms 

and network configurations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a user interface for improving communication
between devices or stations on a network. More specifically, the invention relates to a user
interface having the option to define communication channels or virtual links between individual
users or groups of users on the network and the capability to automatically send data to receivers
based upon predetermined receiver defined communication channels.As networks and systems become more integrated and more complex, the amount
and speed of information flow between users creates a need for more versatile and more efficient
control over the information flow process. Current systems do not enable receivers of information
to define how they prefer their information received. Typically a sender controls the form
information should take, forcing the receiver to accept information in the form defined by the
sender.Protocols defining integrated system behavior for devices such as printers, scanners,
workstations and facsimiles, are well known. These protocols define how the systems should
integrate across networks. Operational transparency across networks and device platforms,
provide users with an increasingly integrated and transparent system environment. In this
environment the manipulation of information (such as documents) is transparent to users as a
result of the various network protocols that define the manner in which devices manipulate
information. For example, "Office Systems Technology" Xerox Corporation, Palo Alto, California,
1984, OSD-R8203, is an overview of the Xerox Corporation "8000" series products, which include
workstations, services, ethernet and software development. The "8000" series products are
integrated using Ethernet and the Xerox Network Systems Communication Protocols which
include: Intelnet Transport Protocols: Xerox System Integration Standard, Xerox Corp., Stamford,
Conn., December 1981, XSIS-028112; Courier: The Remote Procedure Call Protocol, Xerox System
Integration Standard, Xerox Corp., Stamford, Conn., December 1981, XSIS-038112; Clearinghouse
Protocol, Xerox Corp., Stamford, Conn., April 1984, XSIS-078404; Authentication Protocol, Xerox
Corp., Stamford, Conn., April 1984, XSIS-098404; Filing Protocol, Xerox Corp., Stamford, Conn.,
May 1986, XNSS-108605. Another example of an integrated system is the ISDN telephone network
that provides services such as fax mail boxes and voice mail boxes.Printers (and printer controllers or servers) are also sometimes referred to as "shared
resources" in a

A user interface for operating a workstation (4) and communicating with a plurality
of remote devices over a network (24) comprising:


a screen display (40) adapted for displaying icons and menu (46,47) options,
predetermined icons (45) identifying data files,
a graphic pointer (7) electrically connected to the screen display (40) for selecting icons
(45) and menu (46,47) options,
means to identify a data file on the screen display (40) by the graphic pointer (7), and
means to specify a transmission destination for said data file, characterized by
means to access a communication channel profile (63) for said destination, said
communication channel profile (63) defining a preferred mode of receipt of data at the destination.
The user interface of claim 1 including means for altering the preferred mode of
receipt.

responsive to the type of data file.
The user interface of any of claims 1 to 4 including means (59) to send the data file
to the destination.
The user interface of any of claims 1 to 5 wherein the communication channel
profile (63) is available in a network repository.

profile (63) defines a priority of communication channels for data receipt comprising:


means for selecting information at the user interface for transmission to the given
destination;
means for automatically accessing the communication channel profile (63), and
means (59) for sending said information to the given destination over a given
communication channel as a function of the communication channel profile (63).
The user interface of any of claims 1 to 7, including a quick send directory (59), the
quick send directory including identifiers (60) for selected destinations, and 


means for automatically transmitting a data file to one of the selected destinations by
