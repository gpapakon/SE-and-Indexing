Lauric acid: pelargonic acid = 50 : 2 to 50 : 15 and/or
 
Lauric acid: capric acid = 50 : 2 to 50 : 15 and/or
 
Lauric acid: myristic acid = 50 : 10 to 50 : 20 and/or
 
Lauric acid: stearic acid = 50 : 2 to 50 : 20.  

 
Cosmetic deodorants according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the following weight ratios of the fatty 

acids with respect to one another are present:

50 : 20 : 20,
 
preferably:
 
Lauric acid : caprylic acid : capric acid = 50 : 1 : 1 to 

50 : 5 : 5.
