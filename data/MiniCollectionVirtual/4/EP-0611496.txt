<CLAIMS>
Power supply for supplying the heater coil of a 
tube (WR), in particular a travelling-wave tube, a 

transformer (Tr) and an invertor (S1, S2) being provided 
in the heater circuit of the tube (WR), characterized in 

that the frequency of the alternating current can be 
reduced during the heating time of the tube (WR) starting 

from a high value to a low value, in such a way that the 
change, due to this frequency change, in the inductive 

voltage drop across the stray inductance (Ls) of the 
transformer (Tr) limits the heating current. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the high starting value of the frequency of the 

alternating current is selected as a function of the 
magnitude of the stray inductance (Ls) of the transformer 

(Tr). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the frequency of the alternating current 

can be varied in a ratio of approximately 20:1. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the frequency of the alternating 

current, starting from approximately 200 kHz, can be 
decreased within approximately 40 seconds to a nominal 

frequency of, for example, 10 kHz. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the frequency of the alternating 

current can be reduced in stages. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the transformer (Tr), by which the 

tube (WR) can be heated, is supplemented by means of at 
least two electronic push-pull switches (S1, S2) to give  

 
a push-pull invertor.
