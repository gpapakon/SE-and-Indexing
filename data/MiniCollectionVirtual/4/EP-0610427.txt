<DESCRIPTION>
Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a member
of a family of structurally related cytokines that elicit
a variety of responses, including growth, differentiation,
and morphogenesis, in many different cell types.
(Roberts, A.B. and M.B. Sporn, In: Peptide Growth
Factors and Their Receptors, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg,
pp. 421-472 (1990); Massague, J., Annu. Rev. Cell. Biol.
6:597-641 (1990)) In vertebrates at least five different
forms of TGF-β, termed TGF-β1 to TGF-β5, have been
identified; they all share a high degree (60%-80%) of
amino-acid sequence identity. While TGF-β1 was initially
characterized by its ability to induce anchorage-independent
growth of normal rat kidney cells, its
effects on most cell types are anti-mitogenic. (Altschul,
S.F. etal., J. Mol. Biol.215:403-410 (1990); Andres,
J.L. etal., J. Cell. Biol.109:3137-3145 (1989)). It is
strongly growth-inhibitory for many types of cells,
including both normal and transformed epithelial, endothelial,
fibroblast, neuronal, lymphoid, and hemato-poietic
cells. In addition, TGF-β plays a central role
in regulating the formation of extracellular matrix and
cell-matrix adhesion processes.In spite of its widespread effects on cell phenotype
and physiology, little is known about the biochemical
mechanisms that enable TGF-β family members to elicit
these varied responses. Three distinct high-affinity 
cell-surface TGF-β-binding proteins, termed type I, II
and III, have been identified by incubating cells with
radiolabelled TGF-β1, cross-linking bound TGF-β1 to cell
surface molecules, and analyzing the labelled complexes
by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (Massague, J. and
B. Like, J. Biol. Chem.260:2636-2645 (1985); Cheifetz,
S. etal.J. Biol. Chem.261:9972-9978 (1986).) The
binding constants are about 5-50pM for the type I and II
receptor and 30-300 pM for the type III receptor. (Boyd,
F.T. and J. Massague, J. Biol. Chem.264:2272-2278
(1989))The type I and II receptors, of estimated 53 and
70-100 kilodaltons mass respectively, are N-glycosylated
transmembrane proteins that are similar in many respects.
Each of these receptors has a distinct affinity for each
member of the TGF-β family of ligands. (Boyd, F.T. and
J. Massague, J. Biol. Chem.264:2272-2278 (1989)) In
contrast, the type III receptor shows comparable affinities
for all TGF-β isotypes; the type III receptor is
the most abundant cell-surface receptor for TGF-β in many
cell lines (upwards of 200,000 per cell), and is an
integral membrane proteoglycan. It is heavily modified
by
