<ABSTRACT>
The plug-in socket connection which is secured against axial forces serves for the connection of the spigot end (3) of a pipe, which can be inserted, with radial play, into the socket end (2) of another pipe. Arranged in the socket end is a sealing ring (8) and a clamping ring (14) which is designed separately from said sealing ring and has a multiplicity of clamping segments (15) which are arranged at mutual spacing in the circumferential direction and which exhibit a convex outer surface (17) and, on their inner surface (18), in each case one toothing arrangement (19), said toothing arrangements, when axial forces arrive, by interaction of the convex outer surface (17) with an inner surface (18), tapering conically to the end, of the pipe socket, press radially against the spigot end (3). Integrally formed on the clamping ring (14) is a retaining part (20) which can be fixed at the socket end, bears the clamping ring and consists of elastomer. A design which permits satisfactory gripping is achieved if the annular-disc-shaped portion (23), which comes to bear on the socket end surface (22), is designed in a reinforced manner, belongs to the retaining part and from which there extends the connecting portion (24) leading to the clamping ring (14), is assigned a steel ring (28) which increases the bending strength thereof. In particular in the case of relatively large nominal widths, it is expedient if the clamping ring (14) is provided with a circumferential cutout for receiving a flexurally rigid supporting ring (31) consisting preferably of steel.

Thrust-locked spigot-and-socket joint, in particular 
for shaped parts as well as for centrifugally cast 

spigot pipes (1), in which the spigot end (3) of the 
one pipe is insertable with radial clearance into the 

socket end (2) of the other pipe, in which are 
disposed a sealing ring (8) and a clamping ring (14), 

which is separate from the sealing ring and comprises 
a plurality of clamping segments (15) which are 

disposed a mutual distance apart in a peripheral 
direction, have a crowned outer lateral surface (17), 

are connected to one another in a peripheral direction 
in each case by an intermediate layer of rubber or the 

like vulcanized thereon and each have on their inner 
surface teeth (19) which in the event of axial forces, 

by virtue of cooperation of the crowned lateral 
surface (17) with an inner surface (18) of the pipe 

socket which tapers conically towards the end, press 
radially against the spigot end (3), wherein there is 

formed on the clamping ring (14) a retaining part (20) 
made of elastomer, which carries the clamping ring, is 

fixable to the socket front end and comprises an 
annular-disc-shaped portion (23), which comes to lie 

against the socket end face (22), as well as a 
substantially conically tapering connection portion 

(24), which extends from the inside edge of the socket 
end face (22) to the clamping ring (14) and may, in 

dependence upon the external dimensions of the spigot 
end (3) to be introduced, widen together with the 

clamping ring (14) and in so doing may stretch in 
axial direction, wherein the connection portion (24) 

leading to the clamping ring (15) emanates from the 
annular-disc-shaped portion (23), which comes to lie 

against the socket end face (22) and by virtue of a 
reinforced construction has an increased flexural 

strength, and wherein the socket end face (22) at the  
 

inside edge has a recess region adapted to the cross 
section of the reinforced annular-disc-shaped portion 

(23), characterized in that the clamping ring (14) 
with the clamping segments (15) and with the 

intermediate layer, which is vulcanized thereon and 
connects the clamping segments in a peripheral 

direction, is provided at the rear side remote from 
the disc-shaped portion (23) with a peripheral recess 

(30), in which a flexurally stiff supporting ring (31) 
is disposed. 
Spigot-and-socket joint according to claim 1, 
characterized in that fixed in the peripheral recess 

(32) is a retaining ring (32) made of elastomeric 
material which fixes the received supporting ring (31) 

in position. 
Spigot-and-socket joint according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the supporting ring (31) is made 

of steel. 
Spigot-and-socket joint according to one of claims 2 
to 3, characterized in that the peripheral recess (30) 

of the clamping ring (14) is open in an axial 
direction towards the side remote from the annular-disc-shaped 

portion (23) and that the retaining ring 
(32) fixed in the peripheral recess (30) is provided 

with an axial insertion gap (33) for the supporting 
ring (31). 
Spigot-and-socket joint according to claim 4, 
characterized in that th
e width of the insertion gap 
(33) is smaller than the diameter of the supporting 

ring (31).
