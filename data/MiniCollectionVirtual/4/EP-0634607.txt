<ABSTRACT>
Steam generator of the recirculation type carrying out a transfer of heat between a fluid circulating in a primary circuit and a fluid circulating in a secondary circuit, consisting of a pressure jacket (1) containing a vaporisation enclosure (6) provided with a roof (9) and covering a bank of tubes passed through by the primary fluid, the generator comprising means making possible the introduction of the secondary fluid, its circulation in the vaporisation enclosure and the extraction of the steam generated by the secondary fluid at the time of this circulation, means of drying the steam being arranged between the roof of the vaporisation enclosure and the means of extracting the steam (7), these means of drying comprising cyclone separators consisting of cyclones fixed to first ends of tubular columns, the second ends of which are fixed on the roof of the vaporisation enclosure, communicating with the vaporisation enclosure, characterised in that the cyclone separators (20) are fixed in a removable manner on the roof of the vaporisation enclosure.

<CLAIMS>
Recirculation-type steam generator ensuring a heat transfer between 
a fluid circulating in a primary circuit and a fluid circulating in a secondary 

circuit, constituted by a pressure envelope (1) containing a vaporization 
enclosure (6) having a roof (9) and covering a bundle of tubes (2) 

traversed by the primary fluid, the generator having means permitting the 
introduction of the secondary fluid, its circulation within the vaporization 

enclosure and the extraction of the steam produced by the secondary fluid 
during said circulation, drying means for the steam being placed between the 

roof (9) vaporization enclosure (6) and the steam extraction means (7), 
said drying means incorporating cyclone separators constituted by cyclones 

fixed to first ends of the tubular columns, whereof the second ends are 
fixed to the vaporization enclosure roof communicating with said vaporization 

enclosure, characterized in that each tubular column comprises a base 
(23) integral with the roof (9) of the vaporization enclosure and a spacer 

tube (22) fixed by one of its ends and in detachable manner to the said 
base, the other end of the spacer tube being fixed to at least one cyclone 

(21). 
Steam generator according to claim 1, characterized in that the cyclones 
(21) are detachably fitted to the tubular columns (22). 
Steam generator according to one of the claims 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the dismantlable fastenings are constituted by clamps (24, 25). 
Steam generator according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that it comprises means for supporting the cyclone separators, said 

supporting means being fixed to the roof of the vaporization enclosure. 
Steam generator according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
supporting means and the cyclone separators have complementary elements 

(35, 26) permitting the guidance of the cyclone separators during their 
installation. 
Steam generator according to claim 5, characterized in that the cyclone  
 

separator supporting means incorporate a ring (38) and abutments (36) permitting 
the radial holding of the structure in the outer envelope of the steam 

generator. 
Steam generator according to any one of the claims 4 to 6, characterized 
in that the supporting means include a reception mast (33) for a cyclone 

separator handling tool. 
Steam generator according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the vaporization enclosure roof is provided with a trap door 

(40) permitting the passage of a person.
