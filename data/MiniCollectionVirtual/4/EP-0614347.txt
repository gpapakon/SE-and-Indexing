<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel ultrahigh 
molecular weight linear polyethylene (UHMWLPE). This 
novel UHMWLPE, in the form of a shaped article, 
exhibits in various embodiments a unique combination of 
properties making the material useful as a bearing 
surface, in general, but particularly useful as a 
prosthetic hip joint cup and as other prosthetic shapes 
for replacement of other joints of the human body. In U.S. Patent. No. 3,944,536 (March 1976), 
Lupton et al. describe UHMWPE in the form of a 
fabricated article exhibiting an elastic modulus of 
340,000 to 500,000 psi, a tensile impact strength of 
140 to 600 ft lb/in2, a density of 0.95 to 0.98 g/cc at 
25°C, a crystalline melting point of 142 to 148°C (as 
measured by differential thermal analysis) and a unique 
crystalline form characterized by the absence of fold 
spacings of 5 - 200 nm (50-2000 Angstrom units (Å)) and 
the presence of crystal spacings of about 1000 nm 
(10,000 Å). The critical feature of the process of 
producing this UHMWPE is disclosed to involve inducing 
crystallization of the molten polymer above 150°C by 
rapidly increasing the applied pressure from an initial 
level of 0.1 to 100 MPa (1 to 1000 atmospheres) to a 
second level of 202 to 707 MPa (2000 to 7000 
atmospheres) and then cooling rapidly while maintaining 
a pressure sufficient to maintain the polyethylene in 
the solid phase until the temperature is below the 
crystalline melting point of the polyethylene at 
atmospheric pressure. In Kunstoffe German Plastics 77 (1987) pp. 
617-622, in an article entitled "Ultrahigh Molecular 
Polyethylene  
 
for Replacement Joints", Eyrer et al. point out that the 
service life of joint replacements made of UHMWPE is 
limited. Analysis of the damage to over 250 explanted 
hip cups and tibial plateaus revealed a changed property 
profile which they explained by post-crystallization 
resulting from oxidative chain decomposition. They 
suggested optimizing the processing of polyethylene 
under higher pressure and higher temperature to increase 
the degree of crystallinity. The Eyrer et al. product 
displays a creep of above 5% at a compression of 1000 
psi (6.9 N/mm2) for 24 hours at 37°C. EP-A-0,373,800 (E. I. du Pont de Nemours and 
Company) discloses novel ultrahigh molecular weight 
linear polyethylene in the form of a shaped article, 
exhibiting a unique combination of properties making the 
material useful as a bearing surface, in general, but 
particularly useful as a prosthetic hip joint cup. A 
novel process for
