<ABSTRACT>
A DC-DC boost converter for directly driving a capacitive 
load employs four switches for cyclically 

commuting the connection configuration of an energy 
storing inductor. First and second switches are driven 

at a relatively high frequency and provide an impulsive 
charge path of the inductor by connecting one or the 

other end to a power supply rail. Third and fourth 
switches are driven in phase opposition to each other 

at a relatively low frequency and provide a discharge 
path from one and the other end of the inductor, respectively, 

toward an output node of the circuit to 
which the capacitive load is connected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved boost
converter, particularly suited for directly driving a
capacitive load at a relatively high voltage. The
circuit is particularly suited for integration, being
capable of delivering a voltage that is substantially
twice the intrinsic breakdown voltage of the integrated
structures that would compose the circuit.The necessity of driving or powering components such
as electroluminescent diode displays (EL LAMPS) and
more in general low power actuators or indicators
functioning at relatively high voltage, for example at
voltages comprised between 60V and 120V, is often
encountered in electronic apparatuses.Reduction of energy consumption is an attendant
requisite that becomes of fundamental importance in
battery operated portable apparatuses, for example
electronic watches, pocketable calculators, computers,
etc..The use of voltage multipliers for generating high
voltages, starting from particularly low supply voltages,
for example 1.2V battery voltage, is practically
impossible because of a progressive increase of losses
with the number of stages. In these cases, DC-DC
converter circuits commonly referred to as boost
converters, are employed.A boost converter is functionally constituted by an
energy storing inductor, connected to the supply and
momentarily driven toward ground by a switch, during a
charging phase. The energy stored in the inductor is
then discharged during a successive discharge phase
through a diode to an output capacitor, across the
terminals of which an incrementally increased voltage
may be developed in function of the number of cycles of
discharge of the reactive energy stored in the 
inductor. Normally a boost converter is completed by a
control circuit that regulates the voltage developed
across the charge storing capacitor by appropriately
driving the switch. The charge capacitor or capacitors
provide a high voltage supply to user circuits or to
components that normally require a high voltage.In case of components that may be driven at a high
voltage and which may be electrically assumed to be
equivalent to a capacitance having a more less high
loss-factor, as for example electroluminescent diodes,
it is a common practice to directly drive the load
element with the converter circuit, by inverting, by
the use of pairs of swiches, driven in phase opposition
by complementary driving signals at a relatively low
frequency, the connections of the two terminals of the
load (that may be considered as a capacitor) to the
cathode of the
