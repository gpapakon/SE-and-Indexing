<ABSTRACT>
A fitting part for the pivot-axis side of a window of a door which is mounted either only pivotably or pivotably and tiltably on a fixed frame (1) is designed with respect to its pin-like anchorage elements (9, 10) and through-passage bores (13) such that the drilling patterns (18) for the upper fitting part (6) and for the lower fitting part (7) are arranged along a common straight line (20), on the one hand, and, on the other hand, are identical, with the result that one and the same drilling jig can be used for drilling. If, furthermore, in a preferred manner said drilling patterns (18, 21) are arranged symmetrically with respect to a transverse centre plane (22) of the pivot-axis-side vertical member (12), then, in relation to this, the production of a single type of frame for left-hand sashes/leaves for right-hand sashes/leaves (2) is sufficient. Said sash/leaf may be a straightforward pivoting sash/leaf or a pivoting/tilting sash/leaf.

<CLAIMS>
A pivoting and tilting fitting with a pivot bearing (6) 
and a corner bearing (7) for the pivotable and tiltable 

seating of a pivoting and tilting wing (2) of a window, 
door or the like, with through-bores (13), which are 

disposed on a preferably plate- shaped base body (8), for 
the fastening screws (11), and with pin- shaped anchoring 

elements (9, 10) disposed on the back of the base body 
(8), wherein the through-bores (13) and the anchoring 

elements (9, 10) are arranged in a line (20), and wherein 
the same number of through-bores (13) and anchoring 

elements (9, 10) are located on both sides of an imagined 
transverse plane (14) of the bearing, and wherein the 

base bodies (8) of the two bearings (6 and 7) are 
embodied to be the same. 
A pivoting and tilting fitting with a pivot bearing (6) 
and a corner bearing (7) for the pivotable and tiltable 

seating of a pivoting and tilting wing (2) of a window, 
door or the like, with through-bores (13), which are 

disposed on a preferably plate- shaped base body (8) of  
 

the corner bearing (7), for the fastening screws (11), 
and with pin-shaped anchoring elements (9, 10) disposed 

on the back of the base body (8) of the corner bearing 
(7), wherein the through-bores (13) and the anchoring 

elements (9, 10) are arranged in a line (20), and wherein 
the same number of through-bores (13) and anchoring 

elements (9, 10) are located on both sides of an imagined 
transverse plane (14) of the bearing, and wherein a 

bearing bracket (23) with a bearing pin (24) pivotably 
seated thereon, which is pivotable in a plane extending 

perpendicularly with the base body plane or fixed frame, 
is located on the front of the plate-shaped base body (8) 

of the corner bearing (7), in particular in its position 
of use. 
The pivoting and tilting fitting in accordance with claim 

1 or 2, characterized in that a further through-bore (13) 
or a further anchoring element is disposed at the 

location of the imagined transverse plane (14) of the 
bearing. 
The pivoting and tilting fitting in accordance with one 
of the preceding claims, characterized in that at least 

two bearing lugs (15, 17) for receiving a bearing bolt or 
the like are located at a distance from each other on the 

front of the plate- shaped base body (8) of the pivot 
bearing (6).  

 
The pivoting and tilting fitting in accordance with claim 
4, characterized by three bearing lugs (15, 16, 17), the 

center one (16) of which is respectively at the same 
distance from the two outer ones (15, 17), wherein 

respectively two through- bores (13) are located between 
neighbouring bearing lugs (15, 16; 16, 17). 
The pivoting and tilting fitting in accordance with claim 
4 or 5, characterized in that respectively one anchoring 

element (9, 10) is located in the area of each outer 
bearing lug (15, 17). 
The pivoting and tilting fitting in accordance with at 
least one of claims 4 to 6, characterized in that all 

bearing lugs (15, 16, 17), through-bores (13) and 
fastening elements (9, 10) are arranged in a common 

imagined longitudinal center plane of the pivot bearing 
(6). 
The pivoting and tilting fitting in accordance with claim 
2, characterized in that all through-bores (13) and 

anchoring elements (9, 10) of the corner bearing (7) are 
disposed in the pivot plane of the bearing pin (24).
