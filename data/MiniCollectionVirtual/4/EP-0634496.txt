<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high strength and high ductility TiAl-based 
intermetallic compound. TiAl-based intermetallic compound is excellent as a component material for a 
rotating part in an engine because it is lightweight and has an excellent heat-resistance. 
However, normally it is very brittle and hence, an improvement in this respect is desired. In order to provide both the strength and the ductility at ambient temperature, 
various TiAl-based intermetallic compounds have been conventionally proposed. For 
example, there are known TiAl-based intermetallic compounds produced by subjecting an 
ingot containing niobium and boron, or vanadium and boron added thereto to an 
isothermal forging (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 298127/89). Such a prior art TiAl-based intermetallic compound has relatively high 
ductility and strength at ambient temperature, because it is produced through isothermal 
forging at a high temperature, but such compounds have not yet been put into practical  
 
use. In addition, the prior art TiAl-based intermetallic compounds suffer from a problem 
that it is absolutely necessary to conduct the isothermal forging at a high temperature after 
the casting, thereby bringing about increases in the number of manufacturing steps and in 
equipment cost. Therefore, an increase in manufacturing cost of the Tial-based intermetallic 
compound is inevitable, and moreover, the degree of freedom of the shape of the products 
made from the intermetallic compounds is low. From EP-A-0 495 454 it is known that the strength of a TiAl-based 
intermetallic compound may be enhanced by adding boron B to the 
compound. Further, from this document it is known to add vanadium 
V, niobium Nb or chromium Cr etc. in order to enhance the 
ductility property of a compound. In particular this document 
discloses that an addition of more than 5 at% of V/Nb will lead 
to a saturation of the ductility enhancing effect. From EP-A-0 477 559 it is known to produce cast γ-TiAl 
intermetallic compounds with additions of niobium Nb and boron B. 
In particular this document discloses that niobium is to be added 
in a concentration of 8 at% and boron is to be added in a 
concentration of 1.5 at%. By doing so, high strength and high 
ductility properties can be obtained in such compounds. US-A-4 857 268 is related to TiAlV-based alloys. This document 
discloses Ti52-46Al46-50V2-4 alloys in order to obtain improved 
ductility. From US-B-4 842 820 there is known a TiAl composition containing 
boron
