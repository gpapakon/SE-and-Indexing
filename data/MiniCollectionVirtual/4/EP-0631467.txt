<ABSTRACT>
In a method of micropropagation, certified plants (1) received in tubes (2) are divided to provide nodal and apex cuttings (3, 4). These cuttings are planted in an agar gel (5) containing macro- and micro-nutrients in a tray (6), and enclosed in plastics sheeting (7) for growth under high photo photon flux and carbon dioxide enriched conditions to provide microplants. The microplants are divided to provide nodal and apex cuttings (8, 9), of which the apex cuttings (9) are replanted in a foam substrate (11) and again enclosed in gas and vapour permeable plastics sheeting (13) for further growth, again in a high photo photon flux and enriched carbon dioxide environment. Cyclic repetition of initially growth on agar and subsequently growth on substrate enable very substantial numbers of genetically consistent plants to be grown. In a final stage of the process, cuttings (16) taken from the growth arrays (14) which develop within the enclosures (13) are transferred for planting out in a substantially natural environment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to micropropagation. In particular,
the invention is directed to certain improvements in micropropagation
techniques enabling enhanced levels of production of tuber-forming
micro-plants in particular, such as potato plants.In the micropropagation of plants such as potatoes, it is
known to nurture certified micro-plants on a nutrient substrate
medium consisting of sugars with macro- and micro-nutrients gelled in
agar. Development of micro-plants in this manner is acceptable for
small populations, but since the nutrient media are subject to
bacterial and fungal contamination, the risk of loss of growth groups
following such contamination is such that micropropagation based on
the else of these media is less satisfactory when large plant
populations are in question. While contamination may be minimised
by high standards of hygiene and sterilisation, the significant level
of manual input required in customary micropropagation processes
renders the maintenance of high standards difficult of achievement. It is also known to grow micro-plants on such media by their
placement in a growth chamber under temperature control and with
exposure to light. Typically, the light is provided by ordinary
"white" fluorescent tubes and does not include any photosynthesising
component. The sole source of carbohydrate is the sucrose, while
there is a high mineral content in the nutrients, which are typically
formulated according to MURASHIGE and SKOOG. After several
generations of growing in this way, aberrations develop such that
when plantlets raised on sucrose are planted out, they are not able
to transpire by photosynthesis in the normal way, in other words they
are non-photoautrophic. They are therefore not responsive to
sunlight in the manner of a normal plant. Thus, in order to meet
the objective of aseptic or sterile growth of large populations of
plants, the objective of providing plants that are capable of growing
in normal manner when planted out at the end of the micropropagation
process may be lost.In PCT/GB90/01001, International Publication No. WO
91/15110,
which corresponds to the preambles of method claim 1 and apparatus claim 7,
a method of micropropagation is described in which a series
of horizontal cuts are made through a mass of fairly straight stemmed
plantlets growing from a gelled nutrient medium to obtain cut crop
parts containing on average at least one tip or node per cut
portion. At each cut, the crop parts are transferred in bulk, for
example by air flow or gravity, to a
