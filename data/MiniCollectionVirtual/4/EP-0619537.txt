<ABSTRACT>
In order to operate a plurality of utilities 
(2,3,4,5), the utilities (2,3,4,5) are interconnected 

via a communication path (11). Each utility (2,3,4,5) 
has a control device (1) for controlling the utility 

(2,3,4,5) and a memory (12) for storing information 
factors which are used by the corresponding control 

device (10). The information factors corresponding to 
all the utilities (2,3,4,5) are investigated by an 

extraction device (13) to determine which are common 
to the utilities (2,3,4,5) and which are related.
 
Where the common information factors are identified, 

they are passed by the communication path (11) to the 
memories (12) of all the utilities (2,3,4,5). 

Similarly, when related information factors are found, 
a calculating device (14) calculates common 

information which is also passed via the communication 
path (11) to the memories (12) of all the utilities 

(2,3,4,5). In this way, utilities (2,3,4,5) may 
operate more efficiently than when they are operated 

on a stand-alone basis. The investigation of the 
information factors, and the calculating of common 

information from related information factors may be 
distributed among the utilities (2,3,4,5) or carried 

out by a common control device (6). The utilities  
 

(2,3,4,5) may be electric power supply systems, 
district heating and cooling systems, sewage disposal 

systems, waste recovery systems, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method (as defined in claim 1) of 
operating a plurality of utilities of a geographical 
region, such as a town or city. The present invention 
also relates to a utilities network system (as defined in claim 11) for 
carrying out the method, and to a control device (as defined in claim 19) for 
such a network system. It is well known to provide computer control of 
one or more utilities serving a geographical region 
such as a town or city. For example, an electric 
power supply network, including one or more power 
stations and a grid of transmission lines, may be 
controlled in dependence on the power required by the 
users connected to the network. The computer control 
seeks to achieve optimum power generation in 
dependence on predicted and actual power requirements. 
Similar control of water supply and/or sewage networks 
may be achieved using suitable computer systems. 
Moreover, the increasing power of computer systems has  
 
enabled computer control of other utilities, such as 
a road network, to ensure that traffic flows as 
smoothly as possible, without traffic jams. In 
general, in the prior art, each such utility has been 
operated independently of all other utilities serving 
the geographical region. No account has been taken of 
the effects of one utility on another. There have been proposals for physical 
integration of utilities, such as generating electric 
power using heat produced from waste disposal. Thus, 
JP-A-4-97401 disclosed an integrated utilities plant 
in which various utilities were physically integrated, 
so that energy resources could be transferred between 
the utilities. Furthermore, JP-A-4-131600 disclosed a plan for 
supplying heat to a community in which the plant was 
run on the basis of predicted variations in heat 
demand, but also the basis of a modification based on 
the number of people in the community at any time. In general, all utilities are run on the basis of 
a plurality of information factors relating to that 
utility. Thus, for example, a district heating and 
cooling system will be run on the basis of the number  
 
of houses supplied, the amount of heat supplied 
thereto, the amount of power lost, the pipe network 
system for supplying the heating, etc. The present 
invention originates in the idea that one or more of 
the information factors of one utility may be common, 
or at least related, to an information factor of 
another utility. Therefore, at its most general, the present 
invention proposes that
