<ABSTRACT>
According to a process for preparing acesulfam salts by reacting amidosulfonic acid salts with diketen, yielding an acetoacetamidosulfonic acid salt (I), ring closure is effected under the influence of an at least equivalent amount of SO3, and at least the ring closure reaction is carried out in the presence of an halogenated, aliphatic hydrocarbon as inert solvent. The cyclization product is treated with water and the thus obtained acesulfam-H (II) is converted into a non-toxic salt. During distillation of the crude solvent developed, once water and low boiling products have been separated and a suffiently pure solvent to be reused to prepare the compounds (I) and/or (II) has been recovered, the remaining solvent-containing distillation residue is directly reintroduced, with no further purification, into the system, downstream of the reaction vessel, in order to effect the ring closure reaction. Also disclosed is a device for carrying out this process.

A process for the preparation of acesulfam salts by
reaction of salts of amidosulfonic acid with diketene

to give a salt of acetoacetamidosulfonic acid
(I), ring closure by the action of at least about an

equivalent amount of SO
3
, at least this ring closure
reaction being carried out in the presence of a

halogenated, aliphatic hydrocarbon as an inert
solvent, treatment of the cyclization product with

water and conversion of the resulting acesulfam-H
(II) into the form of a non-toxic salt, which

comprises, in the work-up by distillation of the
resulting crude solvent, after removal of water and

low-boilers and recovery of solvent sufficiently
pure for reuse in the preparation of compounds (I)

and/or (II), directly returning the remaining,
solvent-containing distillation residue, without

further purification, into the system downstream of
the reaction vessel for carrying out the ring

closure reaction.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
solvent used is methylene chloride.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
work-up by distillation is carried out in only one

distillation column.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 3, wherein the solvent-containing distillation 

residue is returned at least at one point of the
system, preferably into the vessel for treating the

cyclization product with water, the phase separation
vessel downstream of this and/or the extraction

vessel following this.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 4, wherein the salt of acetoacetamidosulfonic

acid used is trialkylammonium acetoacetamido-sulfonate,

the ring closure is carried out by the action of a
more than equimolar amount of SO
3
, preferably in
methylene chloride as solvent,
the SO
3
 adduct produced after the ring closure
reaction is hydrolyzed in a hydrolysis vessel to

give acesulfam-H,
a separation is carried out in a downstream phase
separation vessel into an organic phase and aqueous

sulfuric acid-containing phase, this aqueous phase
is then extracted in an extraction vessel with

methylene chloride and this methylene chloride,
together with the organic phase from the phase

separation vessel, is fed to a further extractor for
washing with water,
the non-toxic salts of acesulfam-H are recovered, by
neutralization using bases, from the organic phase

thus purified and a separation is carried out in a
downstream phase separation vessel into aqueous salt

solution and a methylene chloride phase, and
this methylene chloride phase is fed, if desired via
at least one further extraction stage, to the

distillation column.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 5, wherein


the crude solvent is introduced into a distillation
column in the bottom thereof or above this bottom,

the distillation residue, which in addition to parts
of the solvent contains solid by-products and high-boilers, 

is withdrawn from this distillation column
and returned into the vessel for the treatment of

the cyclization product, into the phase separation
vessel downstream of this and/or into the extraction

vessel following this for extraction of the sulfuric
acid phase,
the water, small amounts of the solvent and any low-boilers
which may be present with this are withdrawn

at the head of this distillation column, while the
majority of the solvent is returned as reflux into

the distillation column,
and purified solvent is withdrawn from the central
part of the column from an intermediate plate which

is located beneath the reflux and above the feed of
the crude solvent introduced into the column and

this purified solvent is returned into the system.
The process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the
purified solvent is returned into the reaction

vessel.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 7, wherein the solvent-containing distillation

residue is returned into the hydrolysis vessel.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 8, wherein the solvent-containing distillation

residue is returned into the extractor, provided
downstream of the hydrolysis vessel, for the extraction

of the acesulfam-H compound still present in
the aqueous phase.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 9, wherein the distillation residue from the

distillation column still contains at least 10% by
weight, preferably up to 98% by weight, of solvent.
An arrangement for carrying out the process according
to the invention, essentially comprising a 

reaction vessel (3) for carrying out the cyclization
reaction from a salt of acetoacetamidosulfonic acid

(I) and SO

separation vessel the condensed vapors pass from the
