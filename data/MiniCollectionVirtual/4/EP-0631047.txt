<ABSTRACT>
2.1 In known internal combustion engines with a charge pressure-dependent full-load stop and a starting excess fuel solenoid, a inadmissibly high fuel delivery quantity can also be set during normal operation of the internal combustion engine if the solenoid is energised. 2.2 According to the invention, this is prevented by a spring steel lever (13), which can be drawn out of a recess (14) in the control rod (2) of the internal combustion engine only for setting the starting excess fuel quantity.

An internal combustion engine comprising a control device for 
injection-pump elements which convey fuel through injection lines and injection 

valves to the engine combustion chamber, in which the control device comprises 
a manifold pressure-dependent full-load abutment (LDA) which adjusts the fuel 

delivery rate in dependence on the manifold pressure, via a linkage (9, 13) 
engaging a control rod (2), and also comprises a starting supplementary-feed 

adjusting device which, by means of an electromagnet (21) acting on the linkage 
(9, 13), increases the fuel delivery rate when the engine starts,
characterised in that
 a lever in the linkage (9, 13) engaging the control rod (2) is 
a spring steel lever (13) which the electromagnet (21), when energised, brings out 

of engagement with a recess (14) in the control rod (2) and moves the control rod 
(2) into a starting supplementary-feed position. 
An internal combustion engine according to claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 a linkage part in the form of a toggle lever (9) is provided for transmitting the 
motion of the manifold pressure-dependent full-load abutment to the spring steel 

lever (13). 
An internal combustion engine according to claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 the toggle lever (9) is disposed inside the engine crankcase. 
An internal combustion engine according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised in that
 the effective beginning of the LDA and the LDA 
abutment are adjustable, in which the adjustment devices are disposed side by 

side. 
An internal combustion engine according to claim 4, 
characterised in 
that
 the adjustment devices are screws (17, 19) which are disposed at right angles 
to the diaphragm axis of the LDA.  

 
An internal combustion engine according to any of claims 2 to 5, 

characterised in that
 a tension spring (16) engages the toggle lever (9) and 
counteracts the manifold pressure acting on the diaphragm (3). 
An internal combustion engine according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised in that
 the electromagnet (21) is disposed in the cooling-air 
stream of the internal combustion engine. 
An internal combustion engine according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised in that
 the electromagnet (21) is separated from the LDA by 
a cooling-air baffle plate. 
An internal combustion engine according to any of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised in that
 additional components are disposed on the casing (1) 
of the LDA.
