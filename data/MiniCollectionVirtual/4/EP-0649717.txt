<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a device for making a multicomponent mixture, having a mixing chamber (1), in which a rotatably driven mixer (12) is arranged, at least two component valves (6,9) opening into the mixing chamber and the mixing chamber having an outlet (4) for the multicomponent mixture. To be able to ensure environmentally friendly cleaning of the mixing chamber, it is provided that at least one flushing valve (7) can open into the mixing chamber.

<CLAIMS>
Device for making a reactive multi-component mixture,
comprising a mixing chamber (1) in which is arranged a

rotatably driven mixer (12), into which chamber at least two
component valves issue, and which chamber has an outlet (3)

for the multi-component mixture and at least one blast air
valve (8) as well as at least one flushing valve (7), which

valves likewise issue into the mixing chamber, characterised
in that water in a high pressure stream is provided as

flushing medium, which water may have added to it a
biologically degradable cleaning means.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
a plurality of the flushing valves (7) are arranged on an

upper part (10) of the chamber housing (2) distributed around
the periphery of the mixing chamber (1), with the chamber

housing being connected releasably to the upper part.
Device according to one of claims 1-2, characterised
in that the flushing valves (7), as well as possibly the blast

air valve, subtend an angle of about 45Â° to the axis of
rotation of the shaft (11) of the mixer (12).
Device according to one of claims 1-3, characterised
in that the flushing valves (7) are arranged offset relative

to the axis of rotation of the shaft (11) of the mixer (12)
such that they produce a swirling stream.
Device according to one of claims 1-4, characterised
in that fixed means are provided in the mixing chamber (1).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that
the flushing medium is heated.
