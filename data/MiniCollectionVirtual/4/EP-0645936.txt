<ABSTRACT>
As an improvement on Delay PAL decoding to suppress Hanover bars, a 
vertically filtered signal is created, centred on the Hanover bar frequency of 

156 cycles per picture height. This is subtracted from the colour difference 
in question when the amplitude is low, but is not subtracted (or is severely 

attenuated before it is subtracted) where the amplitude is high and therefore 
probably attributable to real colour detail.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video signal processing and is especially concerned with the decoding of PAL colour television signals.In the PAL standard, the red colour difference signal has opposite polarity on alternate lines and the simple PAL decoder incorporates a compensating reversal. If the signal contains a colour phase error, the error will appear with opposite polarity on alternate lines at the colour demodulator outputs. In areas of constant colour, these alternating errors produce artifacts known as Hanover bars and it is the purpose of the well-known Delay PAL decoding technique to eliminate Hanover bars by averaging the colour difference signal over two or more lines. It will be recognised that this technique necessarily reduces vertical resolution in the colour difference signals. Accordingly, there is a softening of horizontal chrominance edges.It is an object of the present invention to provide improved video signal processing that enables Hanover bars to be suppressed or eliminated with a much reduced loss of chrominance resolution.Accordingly, the present invention consists, in one aspect, in a method for suppressing Hanover bars in PAL demodulated colour difference signals, comprising the steps of vertical filtering a colour difference signal with a pass band cnetered on the vertical frequency of Hanover bats; non-linearly processing the filtered signal for passing the filtered signal at amplitudes beneath a pre-determined threshold and for attenuating the filtered signal at amplitudes above said pre-determined threshold; subtracting the non-linearly processed signal from the colour difference signal.In another aspect, the present invention consists in a method for suppressing Hanover bars in PAL demodulated colour difference signals, comprising the steps of, for each of the two colour difference signals, vertical filtering a colour difference signal with a pass band centered on the vertical frequency of Hanover bars; non-linearly processing the filtered signal for passing the filtered signal when the other colour difference signal is beneath a pre-determined threshold and for attenuating the filtered signal when the other colour difference signal is above said pre-determined threshold; subtracting the non-linearly processed signal from the colour difference signal.Advantageously, the filtered signal is passed with unity gain for amplitudes up to one quarter of the peak amplitude of the colour difference signal and is attenuated at amplitudes above said threshold.In another aspect, the
