An actuating unit as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that a detachable locking device

the piston (19) until the attainment of the predetermined 

pressure. 
An actuating unit as claimed in claim 8,
characterized
 in that the locking device (28) is 
formed of one or a plurality of resiliently preloaded balls (34, 

41), which are guided in the piston (19) or the annular piston

piston (23) or the piston (19). 
An actuating unit as claimed in claim 8,
characterized
 in that the locking device (28) is 
formed by one or a plurality of locking elements (52) arranged 

in radial bores (53) in the piston (19), which, on the one hand, 
cooperate with a first slope (54) in the annular piston (23) 

and, on the other hand, cooperate with a second slope (55), 
which is provided on a resiliently biassed actuating piston (48) 

that is slidably guided in the piston (19) and is adapted to be 
acted upon by the pressure prevailing in the pressure chamber 

(21). 
An actuating unit as claimed in claim 8,
characterized
 in that the locking device (28) is 
formed of a radially expandable sleeve (60) slipped on the 

piston (19), the radial collar (61) of the sleeve (60) 
cooperating with an annular groove (59) shaped in the piston 

(19). 
An actuating unit as claimed in claim 11,
characterized
 in that the annular groove (59) is 
bounded by two transversely extending flanks (62, 63) of 

different ascent, while the radial collar (61) is radially 
inwardly confined by a first conical annular surface (64) 

adjacent a second conical annular surface (65) that cooperates 
with the flank (63) of steeper ascent.  

 
An actuating unit as claimed in claim 11,
characterized
 in that a spring (66) is compressed 
between the annular piston (23) and the sleeve (60) permitting 

transmission of force from the sleeve (60) to the annular piston 
(23). 
An actuating unit as claimed in claims 11 to 13,
characterized
 in that the annular piston (23) has
