<ABSTRACT>
A capsule (C) containing a precise amount of a 
substance such as mercury is mounted in an electrode 

mount assembly (E) on a temperature sensitive member. At 
elevated temperatures the capsule is moved away from 

lamp components by the temperature sensitive member (40) to 
preclude inadvertent release of the mercury into the 

sealed lamp. After the lamp has cooled, the 
temperature sensitive member urges the capsule into 

biased engagement with a cutting wire (60) so that upon 
supply of current thereto the capsule is melted and 

opened to release the mercury.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to lamps, and more 
specifically to arc discharge lamps, such as 
fluorescent lamps. More particularly, the invention is 
applicable to arc discharge lamps that require a very 
precise amount of a substance to be released in the 
sealed lamp. Many methods are currently known for supplying 
mercury to a fluorescent lamp. For example, patents 
that generally refer to arrangements for introducing 
mercury into a lamp include U.S. Patent Nos. 2,415,895; 
3,230,027; 3,300,037; 3,764,842; 4,182,971; 4,335,326; 
and 4,823,047. As disclosed in many of these patents, 
the most common methods of introducing mercury to a 
sealed lamp are mechanical dispensing, use of a 
mercury-containing amalgam, and release of the mercury 
from a capsule within the fluorescent lamp. One drawback to the foregoing apparatus and 
methods includes the necessity for specialized 
machinery and equipment. Specialized machinery 
unfortunately has additional costs associated 
therewith. Still other ones of these arrangements 
require specialized lamp components to accommodate the 
mercury releasing structure. Still further, some of 
these arrangements have the potential for losing some 
or all of the substance being charged to the lamp 
during processing, as well as the presence of unwanted 
impurities being introduced into the lamp. The use of a capsule sealed inside the lamp to 
subsequently release a substance such as mercury  
 
resolves some of the foregoing problems. U.S. Patent 
Nos. 3,794,402 and 3,794,403, for instance, disclose 
one arrangement of this type wherein a capsule 
containing mercury is disposed inside the lamp 
assembly. The capsule is held against a filament or 
wire. Upon heating of the wire by induction with the 
assistance of a primary coil located outside of the 
lamp, the capsule is ruptured and the mercury released. 
This patent does not, however, address the problem of 
premature rupture of the capsule or vessel during other 
manufacturing and processing steps of the lamp which 
may cause inadvertent heating of the filament or wire 
and consequently prematurely release the mercury. This 
particular arrangement in the '402 and '403 patents 
also requires a primary coil outside of the lamp that 
must be accurately aligned with the internal release 
mechanism. Even having achieved such alignment, 
reliable mercury dosing is not always possible. It is an object of this invention, therefore, to 
provide a device whereby release of a specified 
substance, such as mercury, to a sealed lamp

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for releasing a predetermined amount of a 
substance in a sealed arc discharge lamp having first and second electrical 

lead wires for supplying current from a location outside the lamp into a 
sealed housing thereof, the apparatus comprising: 


a capsule (C) having a chamber defined therein; 
a predetermined amount of a substance originally disposed in 
said capsule chamber for subsequent release into the housing; and 
a cutting means (60) adjacent said capsule for melting and opening 
said capsule in response to current selectively supplied thereto to release 

said substance in said capsule chamber into the housing; characterized by 
a temperature sensitive means (40) connected to the capsule for urging 
said capsule and cutting means apart in response to an elevated 

temperature. 
An apparatus as defined in claim 1, wherein said temperature 
sensitive means also urges said capsule and cutting means together in 

response to a reduction in temperature from the elevated temperature. 
An apparatus as defined in claim 1, wherein said temperature 
sensitive means biases said capsule and said cutting means together under 

temperature ranges below said elevated temperature. 
An apparatus as defined in claim 1, wherein said temperature 
sensitive means includes a bi-metal element secured to said capsule. 
An apparatus as defined in claim 4, wherein said first electrical 
lead wire (12b) is commonly connected to a fila
ment of the lamp and said cutting 
means.  

 
An apparatus as defined in claim 5, wherein said second lead wire (10b) 
is electrically connected to said filament. 
An apparatus as defined in claim 6, further comprising a third 
electrical lead wire (14a) connected to said cutting means. 
An apparatus as defined in claim 7, wherein said first and third 
electrical lead wires mount said cutting means in tension against said 

capsule under temperature ranges below said elevated temperature. 
An apparatus as defined in claim 7, wherein said third wire is 
adapted for selectively supplying electrical current from a location outside 

the lamp to said first and third wires to heat said cutting means and open 
said capsule. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
said temperature sensitive means is in the form of a 

bi-metal spring holding said capsule in tensioned 
contact with said cutting means, said bi-metal spring 

behaving in a manner such that, upon increase in 
temperature, said spring moves said capsule away from 

and out of contact with said cutting means and upon 
subsequent decrease in temperature said spring returns 

the capsule to its initial state of contact and 
tension against said cutting means, said cutting means 

opening said capsule in response to a current 
selectively supplied to said lamp.  

 
An apparatus as defined in claim 10, wherein said electrode mount 
assembly includes a three wire arrangement, said first and third wires being 

adapted for selectively supplying electrical current from a location outside 
said lamp to heat said cutting means and meet and open said capsule. 
An apparatus as defined in claim 11, wherein said first and second 
wires are adapted for supplying electrical current from a location outside 

said lamp to heat a filament of said lamp. 
An apparatus as defined in any of claims 4, 
10 to 12, wherein said bi-metal spring has one end 

mounted to said second wire and a freely suspended 
second end that disposes the capsule against said 

cutting means. 
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding 
claim, wherein said substance contained in said 

capsule is mercury.
