<ABSTRACT>
Cosmetic composition in the form of an aqueous gel containing a gelling agent and an aqueous medium, in which the gelling agent consists of a mixture of:   a) at least one crosslinked acrylic acid polymer which is at least partially neutralised, having a molecular weight of between 700,000 and 4,500,000 approximately, b) at least one copolymer of acrylic acid and of a vinyl monomer bearing amine, amidine and nitrile functional groups, and obtained by hydrolysis of polyacrylonitrile, which is at least partially neutralised, having a molecular weight of between 100,000 and 200,000 approximately, and c) at least one polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of between 10

<CLAIMS>
Cosmetic composition in the form of an aqueous 
gel containing a gelling agent and an aqueous medium, 

characterized in that the gelling agent consists of a 
mixture of: 


a) at least one at least partially neutralized, cross-linked 
acrylic acid polymer having a molecular 

weight of between 700,000 and 4,500,000 approximately, 
b) at least one at least partially neutralized 
copolymer of acrylic acid and vinyl monomer bearing 

amine, amidine and nitrile functions, and obtained 
by hydrolysis of polyacrylonitrile, having a molecular 

weight of between 100,000 and 200,000 approximately, 
and 
c) at least one polyethylene glycol having a molecular 
weight of between 10
5
 and 3 × 10
7
 approximately. 
Cosmetic composition according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that it contains: 


from 0.1 to 1% by weight of the polymer(s) defined in 
a), 
from 0.1 to 1% by weight of the copolymer(s) defined in 
b), and 
from 0.01 to 1% by weight of the polyethylene glycol(s) 
defined in c). 
Cosmetic composition according to either of 
Claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the polyethylene 

glycol(s) defined in c) has/have a molecular weight in 
the region of 15 million. 
Cosmetic composition according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the gelling agent contains a 

poly(glyceryl acrylate) and/or poly(glyceryl 
methacrylate). 
Cosmetic composition according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the poly[glyceryl (meth)acrylate]
 
has a viscosity of 400 to 5,000 pascal seconds as 

measured at 20°C using a BROOKFIELD RTV viscometer. 
Cosmetic composition according to either of 
Claims 4 and 5, characterized in that the poly[glyceryl  

 
(meth)acrylate]
(s) represent(s) from 0.01 to 50% by 
weight of the composition. 
Cosmetic composition according to one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that it contains at least one 

water-soluble cosmetic active agent and/or at least one 
formulation adjuvant. 
Cosmetic composition according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the water-soluble cosmetic active 

agent is chosen from the group composed of humectant 
agents, skin care agents, astringents, sunscreen agents 

and anti-free-radical agents. 
Cosmetic composition according to either of 
Claims 7 and 8, characterized in that the cosmetic active 

agent is a water-soluble oil in a quantity not exceeding 
10% by weight of the composition. 
Cosmetic composition according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the water-soluble formulation 

adjuvant is chosen from the group composed of colorants, 
perfumes, preservatives and pH agents.
