<ABSTRACT>
Haymaking machine, especially windrower, for the windrowing of stalk crop, with at least two vertically adjustable rotary rakes (2, 3) which are driven in rotation about approximately vertical axes of rotation, which machine is connected to the tractor via a machine frame (1), the machine frame (1) being supported on the ground via running wheels and each rotary rake (2, 3) being pivotable upwards through approximately 90@ for transport purposes about an axis (4) approximately parallel to the direction of travel, and the drawbar (15) of the machine frame (1) of the haymaking machine and therefore the coupling points (16) to the tractor being arranged so as to be of variable length in the direction of travel (F) or in the opposite direction and being controlled automatically by means of a link mechanism (18) in dependence on the position of the tractor relative to the haymaking machine.

A haymaking machine, and a swathing machine in particular, for the swathing 
of cereal crops, with at least two height-adjustable circular rakes (2,3) driven 

so as to rotate about approximately perpendicular axes of rotation, which are 
connected to the tractor by means of a machine frame (1), in which situation 

the machine frame (1) is supported on the ground by wheels and in which, for 
transport purposes, each circular rake (2,3) can be pivoted upwards about 90° 

about an axis (4) parallel to the direction of travel, characterised in that the 
drawbar (15) of the machine frame (1) of the haymaking machine, and 

therefore the coupling points (16) to the tractor, are arranged in the direction 
of travel (F) or counter to it, in a manner such that the length can be modified, 

and is automatically controlled as a function of the position of the coupling 

points (16) on the haymaking machine, and therefore, during use, as a function 
of the position of the tractor in relation to the haymaking machine. 
A haymaking machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the carrier 
element (17) of the coupling points (16) is capable of pivoting about a perpendicular 

pivot axis (19). 
A haymaking machine according to Claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
drawbar (15) is guided telescopically in the main carrier element of the machine 

frame (1).  
 
A haymaking machine according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the carrier element (17) of the coupling points (16) of the drawbar 

(15) is controlled by the steering gear (18) in such a way that, when the 
tractor is at full steering lock, the circle of effect of the circular rakes (2,3) in 

the direction of travel (F) is in each case brought in close to the tractor. 
A haymaking machine in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the steering element of the steering gear (18) is connected on 

one side in a jointed manner to the machine frame (1) and, on the other, is 
connected in a jointed manner to the carrier element (17) of the coupling 

points (16). 
A haymaking machine according to Claim 5, characterised in that the interval 
between the steering points (20,21) of the steering element (22) is capable of 

being changed. 
A haymaking machine according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the wheels (12,13) for supporting the machine frame (1), two for 

preference, are arranged in such a way that one wheel (12) supports the 
machine frame (1) behind the front circular rake (2), seen in the direction of 

travel (F). 
A haymaking machine according to one or more of Claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that a distribution gear system (5) can be located for powering the circular 

rakes (2,3) on the drawbar (15). 
A haymaking machine according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that one or both wheels (12,13) are designed as trailing wheels, capable 

of pivotal movement in relation to the machine frame. 
A haymaking machine according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that one circular rake (3) is capable of being pivoted through about 

90° from the operating position into the transport position by means of a four-way 
joint element (24).  

 
A haymaking machine according to Claim 10, characterised in that the lower 
steering element of the four-way joint element (24) is designed as an actuator 

element, capable of lenth modification. 
A haymaking machine according to Claim 10 or 11, characterised in that the 
adjusting element capable of length modification by means of, for preference, 

a single-action hydraulic actuating cylinder (26) 
A haymaking machine according to one of Claims 10 to 12, characterised in 
that the four-way joint element (24) in the transport position (24) of the 

circular rake (3) is capable of being locked by means of a locking element 
(38), which engages automatically when the four-way joint is lowered.
