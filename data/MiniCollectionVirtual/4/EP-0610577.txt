<CLAIMS>
A multi-part (1, 7, 10, 17, 20, 26) handling device which can be 
releasably mounted at the front on a mobile working apparatus, wherein 


a) there are provided a connecting part at the vehicle side for 
connection of the handling device to the mobile working apparatus, a 

carrier part (20, 26) at the component side with holding means for 
moving, holding and delivering the component, and intermediate parts 

between the connecting part and the carrier part (20, 26), 
b) the intermediate parts are movably connected together and to the 
connecting part and the carrier part in such a way that three-dimensional 

movements are possible except for raising and lowering, 
c) a thrust module (4) is mounted displaceably towards both sides 
and is displaceable by means of a thrust drive and can be arrested in a 

desired side position, 
d) there is provided a spacing module (10) which is to be increased 
or reduced in length in the longitudinal direction by means of a spacing 

drive and is to be held in the desired position, 
e) a pivot module (20, 26) is mounted pivotably at the front on the 
spacing module (10) and is to be pivoted by means of a pivot drive and is 

to be arrested in the desired pivot position, 
f) there is provided an inclining module (7) which is to be 
inclined in both directions of inclination about an axis of inclination 

which is oriented parallel to the floor surface in the longitudinal 
direction, and 
g) there is provided a rotating module (17) which is to be rotated 
in both directions of rotation about an axis of rotation which is 

perpendicular to the floor surface and which extends through the 
longitudinal central axis of the spacing module,
 
   characterised in that 
h) arranged at the end of the handling device that is towards the 
vehicle is a lifting module (1) which is to be connected to the mobile  

 
working apparatus and which is displaceable in respect of height with 

respect thereto by means of a lifting drive and which can be fixed at the 
desired height, 
i) the thrust module (4) is provided at the front on the lifting 
module (1), 
j) the spacing module (10) is arranged at the front on the thrust 
module (4), 
k) the pivot module (20, 26) forms the carrier part (20, 26), 
l) the inclining module (7) is provided between the thrust module 
(4) and the spacing module (10) and is to be driven by means of an 

inclining drive and is to be arrested in a given position, and 
m) the rotating module (17) is arranged between the spacing module 
(10) and the pivot module (20) and is to be driven by means of a rotary 

drive and is to be fixed in a desired position. 
A handling device according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
pivot module (20, 26) comprises a pivot arm (20) and a carrier arm (26), 

wherein the pivot arm (20) is pivotably mounted at its lower end (21) in 
a pivot mounting (22) on the spacing module (10) or on the rotating 

module (17) and at the upper end (23) is pivotably connected by way of an 
upper pivot mounting (24) to the carrier arm (26). 
A handling device according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised 

in that the drives of the individual modules (1, 7, 10, 17, 20, 26) are 
mechanical, electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic drives or drives are 

required. 
A handling device according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that provided on the carrier arm (26) as holding means 

are suction cups, electromagnets or mechanical holding means in the form 
of clamps or the like, which are distributed on the carrier arm in a 

given pattern or are arranged on a given layout.
