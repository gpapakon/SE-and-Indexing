<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved catheter 
for treating a tissue target site which is accessible by a 
tortuous path through small vessels. More specifically, 
the present invention relates to a guidewire for a 
catheter, the guidewire having a core wire disposed 
therein. The catheter of the present invention can be 
inserted into the small vessels and can enable a physician 
to identify the magnitude of the target site through 
radiography. Blood vessels and other tubular structures in the body 
often undergo narrowing and the formation of obstructions. 
These vessels can be restored to their original diameters 
by various medical means, especially through the use of 
balloon catheters. A balloon catheter dilates the vessels 
by expanding a balloon on the distal end portion of a 
catheter tube. The balloon tip is inflated by the physician 
when it is placed within an occlusion of a blood vessel 
and dilates the vessel to form a clear path therethrough. 
The catheter and the balloon are single piece 
units with the balloon being a thin catheter wall portion 
of predetermined shape and size. A guidewire is disposed 
within the catheter to stiffen it and to provide guidance 
to the site of the occlusion. The guidewire can also be 
used to stretch the balloon lengthwise in order to reduce 
the diameter so that it can be introduced through the 
obstructed area. Guidewires usually are made of radiopaque 
material so that their precise location can be identified 
during a surgical procedure through fluoroscopic 
viewing. Use of x-ray imaging to view the guidewire, however, 
does not always identify the extent of the occlusion. 
Frequently there is a need to identify the length and  
 
thickness of the occlusion so that the physician can utilize 
the correct balloon size during the surgery. In the prior art, the length and thickness of the 
occlusion is frequently measured by incrementally spaced 
marker bands on the outside of the catheter itself. 
Catheters with marker bands frequently are limited in that 
they cannot always be positioned directly in the vessel or 
in a region of the vessel where the occlusion is located. 
Special catheters for sizing occlusions in vessels have 
been developed but they require multiple catheter use and 
exchanging one for another. Exemplary of markers used on guidewires in the art is 
the balloon catheter disclosed by LeVeen, US-A-4,448,195, in 
which a radiopaque wire is mitered by machining it at predetermined 
locations. Miter cuts are used to measure

<CLAIMS>
A fluoroscopically viewable guidewire for a catheter to measure the 
size and shape of occlusions in a blood vessel, said guidewire comprising: 


a guidewire (21,1) including a core wire (5), said core wire (5) 
terminating in a flexible distal end (5c), said core wire (5) extending along 

the length of said guide wire (21,1), the distal end (5c) of said core wire 
(5) forming a gauging section (5c), the diameter of said core wire (5) 

being less at the gauging section (5c) than elsewhere on said core wire (5); 
a proximal marker (11B,11X), a distal marker (11A,11Y) and at least one 
intermediate marker (11) disposed between said proximal and distal 

markers (11B and 11A or 11X and 11Y), each of said markers 
(11A,11B,11X,11Y,11) being radiopaque and linearly disposed on said 

gauging section (5c); 
the outer diameters of said markers (11A,11B,11X,11Y,11) being equal 
to or less than the outermost diameter of the guide wire (7,8);
 
characterised in that 
said markers (11A,11B,11X,11Y,11) are separated and spaced from one another and 
have holes therein to receive the 

gauging section (5c) of said core wire (5) and 
a helical coil (7) of radiotransparent flexible wire surrounds said gauging 
section (5c) of said core wire (5) and said markers (11X,11Y,11) or 

a helical coil (8) of radiotransparent flexible wire is situated between each 
marker (11A,11B,11). 
A guidewire for a catheter according to claim 1 characterised in 
that said markers (11A,11B,11X,11Y,11) are spaced from one another at 

a predetermined distance. 
A guidewire for a catheter according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the proximal marker (11B,11X), the distal marker  

 
(11A,11Y) and the at least one intermediate marker (11) are rings 

disposed on said gauging section (5c) of said core wire (5). 
A guidewire for a catheter according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the diameter of the core wire in the gauging 

section (5c) is about half the diameter of the remainder of the core wire 
(5). 
A guidewire for a catheter according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the spaces between the markers 

(11A,11B,11X,11Y,11) are filled with a flexible, rubbery mass.
