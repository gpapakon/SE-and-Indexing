<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a fluid management article to be worn adjacent a
user's perineum for collecting and / or absorbing low volumes of bodily fluids

encountered both menstrually and intermenstrually. The article is particularly useful for
everyday use, that is, for managing daily perspiration, vaginal discharge, post intercourse

drainage, and other bodily fluids due to various conditions, such as infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an extremely thin, fluid management article that is
intended to be worn adjacent a user's perineum. The article is useful in collecting and / or
absorbing low volumes of bodily fluids, such as menses, urine, and perspiration.Externally worn absorbent articles for managing discharged bodily fluids are well
known in the art. A plethora of design features have evolved over the years in an effort to
improve the performance of these articles, such as lateral extensions for wrapping around
a user's undergarment, body-conforming means for diminishing any gaps between the
article and the user's body, and the addition of highly absorbent and retentive materials,
such as those materials commonly referred to as superabsorbents. An additional
evolutionary aspect of these articles, is a reduction in article thickness (caliper).The designers of the reduced caliper articles referred to above have maintained
the absorptive capacity of the relatively thicker articles being replaced, thereby providing
users with a thin and flexible article capable of managing significant volumes of fluid.
For example Osbome, III, US Pat. No. 4,950,264, discloses a thin and flexible sanitary
napkin having a capacity great enough to handle medium to high menstrual flows. The
napkins in '264 have a preferred caliper of less than about 2.6 millimeters and total fluid
capacity of at least about 20.0 grams. Brandt et al., US Pat. No. Re. 32,649, discloses
absorbent articles comprising an intimate admixture of hydrophilic fiber material and
hydrogel-forming particles, purportedly capable of holding high amounts of discharged
body fluids.More and more consumers are purchasing and wearing fluid management articles
on an everyday basis, as compared to only during their menstrual period. Consumers may
experience daily perspiration, vaginal discharge, post intercourse drainage, and other fluid
discharges due to various conditions, such as infection. To manage the daily discharge
and to feel "fresh", consumers must purchase and wear standard napkins or panty liners,
dealing with the obtrusiveness and high absorptive capacity associated with these
products. While articles such as those disclosed in '264 and '649 are suitable for
managing significant volumes of fluid, they are overdesigned for managing low volumes,
such as those encountered intermenstrually. Even the least absorbing articles 
commercially available in the US, such as CAREFREE panty liners and KOTEX
LIGHTDAYS pantiliners, offer excess absorption capacity
