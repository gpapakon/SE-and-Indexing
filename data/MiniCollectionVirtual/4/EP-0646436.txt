<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for polishing the periphery portion of a 
wafer, by which improvement on the polishing velocity may be 

effected and besides a more efficient spatial usage of the 
working layer of an abrasive tape is capable, comprising a 

tape holding fixed abrasive grains thereon; a feed reel for 
feeding the tape stored by winding itself; a take-up reel 

for taking up the tape by winding itself; a rotary drum 
inside of which both of the reels are equipped in such a 

manner that they are mountable or demountable, where a 
portion of the tape in the way from the feed reel to the 

take-up reel is adaptive to wind the rotary drum around the 
outer cylindrical surface thereof in close contact in the 

shape of a helicoid and one of the main faces of the wafer 
is positioned to be in a plane intersecting the central axis 

of the rotary drum at an angle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates
to an apparatus for
polishing the periphery of a
wafer according to the preamble of claim 1.Conventionally a silicon single crystal wafer, a
compound semiconductor wafer or the like ( hereinafter
referred to as a wafer ) is provided with a chamfered
portion along the periphery of the wafer by grinding off the
periphery portion.A wafer with the thus ground off chamfer is not free
from generation of fine particles thereon in being handled 
physically or even in mask alignment in a semiconductor
device fabricaton process, though it may prevent the chamfer
of its own from cracking and chipping off. Therefore, the
wafer with the grinding finish on the chamfer is subject to
reduce a yield of devices in semiconductor device
fabrication as well as deteriorate the reliability in
performance. Under such circumstances, it has been a
traditional way to have the chamfer of grinding finish
polished.In the polishing, the ground chamfer is generally
pressed to a polishing buff which is rotating about its axis
and at that same time the polishing spot is fed with a
polishing slurry ( fine abrasive grains ) which is composed
of an alkaline solution with colloidal silica dispersed
therein.When the polishing slurry is fed to the polishing spot
on the chamfer of a wafer, the slurry is sprayed on other
parts than the polishing spot ( for instance a front face or
back face of the wafer ) and thereby the corrosive action of
the alkaline substance included in the slurry gives birth to
surficial flaws in the area affected by the alkaline
substance. These flaws are not able to be removed away in a 
cleaning step which is applied to the wafer to get rid of
the slurry residue. The flaws on the front face of the wafer
is not problematic since a mirror-polishing is applied to
the front face and thereby the flaws are removed together
with a stock polished off, but to this contrary, those on
the back face are left unaffected as it was all the way
through the last stage of a wafer fabrication on the product
and becomes a new particle source in the following stages
and thereby the yield in a semiconductor device fabrication
is adversely affected as well as the characteristics of
devices thus produced are degraded.In view of this situation, an apparatus for polishing
the periphery portion of a wafer is recently contrived which
uses an abrasive tape, which means a tape supporting fixed
abrasive grains thereon instead of an apparatus in which a
wafer is polished with the help of a polishing slurry. In
the former

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for polishing the periphery portion
of a wafer (W) comprising:


a tape (7) holding fixed abrasive grains thereon;
a feed reel (3) for feeding the tape stored by
winding itself;
a take-up reel (4) for taking up the tape by
winding itself and a motor (6) for driving the take-up

reel to rotate about its axis;

characterised by

a rotary drum (2) inside of which both of the reels
are mounted in such a manner that they are

mountable or demountable, whereby a portion of the
tape on its way from the feed reel to the take-up

reel is wound
in close

contact and in the shape of a helicoid
around the outer cylindrical surface of the rotary drum,

and means for positioning one of
the main faces of the wafer to be in

a plane intersecting the central axis of the
rotary drum at an angle not being equal to zero.
An apparatus for polishing the periphery portion
of a wafer according to Claim 1 which further

includes a wafer holder mechanism (8) comprising;

a wafer chuck (80) rotatable about its axis of
rotation;
a third motor for driving the wafer chuck;
a stage for supporting thereon the wafer
chuck and the motor therefor and for 

positioning the wafer relative to the rotary
drum;
a fourth motor for driving the stage and
thereby making the wafer chuck holding the

wafer thereon to get closer to or farther
away from the rotary drum; and
a fifth motor for driving the stage and
thereby making the wafer to position such

that one of the main faces of the wafer
inclines up or down at an angle to a plane

intersecting perpendicularly the axis of
rotation of the rotary drum.
An apparatus for polishing the periphery portion
of a wafer according to Claim 1 or 2 which

further includes a plurality of slits (24a, 24b) arranged in
the outer cylindrical surface of the rotary drum

so as to be positioned almost in parallel with a
generating line of the outer cylindrical surface.

are orientated to be on or in parallel with the
bisector of the angle between a generating line

and a direction of the tape width.
An apparatus for polishing the periphery portion
of a wafer according to Claim 3 wherein a part of

the outer cylindrical surface of the rotary drum
is constructed out of a bearing structure (9), the

outer cylindrical surface of which is freely
turnable in a direction perpendicular to a

generating line of the cylindrical surface of its 
own.
An apparatus for polishing the periphery portion
of a wafer according to Claim 5 wherein the outer

cylindrical surface is composed of an elastic
