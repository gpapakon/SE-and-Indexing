<ABSTRACT>
A hermetically sealed package is provided for the administration of 
a 

solution or other liquid to a patient. The package includes a blow 
molded 

container (10), cap (12) and releaseable cover (14). The cap (12) 
accommodates 

piercing of the cap (12) and container (10) with a draining spike. The 
cap has one 

or more self-closing seals or liners (93) and can be disposed on the 
container (10) 

so as to permit penetration of the cap (12) and container (10) by a 
piercing spike 

without contacting the parting line of the molded container. The cap 
includes a 

special structure (84,86) for guiding the spike at the initiation of 
the piercing 

process, and the cap has an improved structure (94,96) for sealingly 
engaging teh 

spike upon insertion. As the container is drained, one (18) of the 
container walls 

(18,24) collapses toward the other (24) to facilitate the draining 
process and 

provide a convenient shape for subsequent handling and storage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a package which includes at least a container portion from which
fluid contents can be dispensed. The package is particularly suitable for use with, or as part
of, an administration or delivery system for supplying a parenteral solution or other liquid to
a patient.Parenteral solutions or other liquids may be conventionally administered to a patient from a
container elevated above the patient and connected to the patient through a suitable fluid-transfer
system. Such a fluid-transfer system may include a tube with a spike, cannula, or
connector on one end for communication with the container interior and a hollow needle or
cannula on the other end for being connected, directly or indirectly, to the patient.One type of conventional container is blow molded from thermoplastic material, filled with
the desired substance, and then hermetically sealed. Such a container is typically provided
with a hanging loop on the top and a membrane on the bottom which can be pierced by a
draining spike or cannula. Such containers may be provided in a generally non-collapsible
form, and examples are disclosed in the US Patents No. 4,178,976, No. 4,239,726, and No.
4,519,513. A collapsible container suitable for medical fluids is disclosed in US Patent No
Des. 257,287.Another type of container is shown in US 4,576,602, which illustrates a port system for a
blow moulded container. The port system includes an integrally formed tube that projects
outwardly from the container with a pierceable diaphragm (preferably a concave
frusto-conical profile) at
the entry portion of the tube.When a container is pierced and drained through a spike, cannula, or the like, it is desirable to
effect maximum drainage of the fluid contents from the container. Accordingly, it would be
beneficial to 
provide an improved design which effectively promotes
drainage of the container.Further, in order to facilitate handling and
storage of empty (drained) containers, it would be
desirable to provide a container that, when empty or
substantially empty, has a relatively compact
configuration which accommodates such handling and
storage.Some types of hermetically sealed containers
typically employ a substantially rigid, thermoplastic
membrane which is adapted to be pierced by a cannula or
draining spike. In such containers, the membrane size
and shape can make the piercing operation difficult.
There is a risk that the spike or cannula may slip off
of the membrane and accidentally puncture the skin of
the person who is attempting

<CLAIMS>
A pierceable unitary, molded container having a peripheral parting line (42) which
delineates opposed container portions, the container comprising:-


a hollow body portion (18, 20, 24, 26) defining an access port and suitable for
containing a substance to be drained from the container (10);
a sealing wall coextensive with and sealing said access port;
a pierceable membrane in said sealing wall; and
said sealing wall defining guide surfaces (161) that converge toward said pierceable
membrane, the improvement being characterised by:
said sealing wall defining at least two of said guide surfaces (161, 261).,
said guide surfaces each having a generally planar configuration; and
said guide surfaces meeting to define a generally V-shaped concave recess having a vertex

along which said pierceable membrane is defined.
A container as claimed in Claim 1 wherein said guide surfaces (261) converge toward
said pierceable membrane on one side of said parting line (42) to define a recess for receiving

a piercing spike means therewith.
A container as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which said hollow body portion has a
boss defining a sump communicating with said interior of said body portion;


said boss (40) defining said access port; and
said sealing wall defining an end of said boss.
A container as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 3 in which said container is filled and
hermetically sealed.
A container as claimed in Claim 3 in which

said boss (40) has a cap (12) for attachment to said boss over said membrane,
said cap (12) including a resilient, self-sealing liner (93) having an exposed, pierceable, target

portion (85) over said container membrane; 
said boss (40) and said cap (12) having cooperating orientation means (64, 78) for the
placement of said cap (12) on said boss (40) in a predetermined orientation relative to one

another and for positioning said target portion (85) away from said parting line (42).
The container in accordance with Claim 5 in which said container is molded from
thermoplastic material as a unitary structure which is filled and hermetically sealed and said

container parting line (42) is defined at least in part by a ridge of said material extending
across said membrane.
The container in accordance with Claim 5 or Claim 6 in which said parting line (42)
extends across part of said membrane; one of said cap and container defines a lug (64);

and the other of said cap and container defines a recess (78) for engaging said lug (64) when
said cap and container are in said predetermined orientation whereby said target portion (85)

is displaced from said parting line (42) and is absent from the region between said target
portion (85) and said membrane.
