Organopolysiloxanes which contain ester groups 
and comprise units of the general formula 


 
in which 


R
may at each occurrence be an identical or different 
monovalent, SiC-bonded hydrocarbon radical having 1 

to 18 carbon atoms, 
A
may at each occurrence be an identical or different 
radical of the general formula 


 
in which 


R¹
may at each occurrence be an identical or different 
divalent hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 6 carbon 

atoms, 
R²
may at each occurrence be an identical or different 
divalent hydrocarbon radical having 2 to 4 carbon 

atoms, 
R³
may at each occurrence be an identical or different 
divalent hydrocarbon radical having 2 to 6 carbon 

atoms, 
c
is 0 or 1, 
v
is 0 or an integer, 
w
is 0 or an integer, the sum of v and w being 0 or an 
integer from 1 to 16, 
s
is 0 or an integer, 
t
is 0 or an integer, the sum of s and t being an 
integer from 1 to 20, 
x
is 0 or 1, 
y
is 0 or 1, the sum of x and y being 1 or 2, 
a
is 0, 1, 2 or 3, and  
 
b
is 0, 1 or 2, 
 
with the proviso that the sum of a and b is less than or 

equal to 3 and the organopolysiloxane contains at least 
one radical A per molecule. 
Organpolysiloxanes which contain ester groups 
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the sum of x 

and y is 2. 
Organopolysiloxanes which contain ester groups 
according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that c is 0. 
Process for the preparation of organopolysiloxanes 
which contain ester groups, characterized in 

that organic compound (1) of the general formula 

 
in which R¹, R², v, w, x and y are as defined above,
 
is reacted with organopolysiloxane (2) comprising units 

of the general formula 

 
in which R, a and b are as defined above, with the 

proviso that the sum of a+b is less than or equal to 3 
and the siloxane molecule contains at least one Si-bonded 

hydrogen atom,
 
and with cyclic ester (4) of the formula 


 
in which c and R³ are as defined above,
 
in the presence of a catalyst (3) which promotes the 

addition of Si-bonded hydrogen at an aliphatic multiple 
bond, and of a ring-opening catalyst (5). 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in  
 

that
 
in a 1st stage
 
organic compound (1) is reacted with organopolysiloxane 

(2) in the presence of a catalyst (3) which promotes the 
addition of Si-bonded hydrogen at an aliphatic multiple 

bond, and
 
in a 2nd stage
 
the addition product obtained in the 1st stage is reacted 

with cyclic ester (4) in the presence of ring-opening 
catalyst (5). 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that in a 1st stage
 
organic compound (1) is reacted with cyclic ester (4) in 

the presence of ring-opening catalyst (5) and
 
in a 2nd stage
 
the reaction product obtained in the 1st stage is reacted 

with organopolysiloxane (2) in the presence of a catalyst 
(3) which promotes the addition of Si-bonded hydrogen at 

an aliphatic multiple bond. 
Process according to one or more of Claims 4 to 
6, characterized in that organic solvent is additionally 

employed. 
Method of defoaming and/or degassing organic 
systems by adding an organopolysiloxane according to 

Claim 1.
