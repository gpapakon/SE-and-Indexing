<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a high-quality methyl 
methacrylate polymer by polymerizing a monomer comprising 

methyl methacrylate as a main component in the presence of 
a radical polymerization initiator and a chain transfer 

agent, said process comprising the step of adding a small 
amount of methanol as a solvent, and the step of carrying 

out the polymerization in a uniform solution at a temperature 
of 90 to 180°C so that a monomer conversion may be in 

the range of 40 to 90 mol%. 
According to this process, the methyl methacrylate 
polymer can be obtained which reduces the generation of 

silver streaks, voids, coloring, odor and the like at the 
time of thermal molding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process 
for preparing a methyl methacrylate polymer, and more 
specifically, it relates to a process for stably efficiently 
preparing a high-quality methyl methacrylate polymer. Methyl methacrylate polymers have excellent characteristics 
in points of transparency, weathering resistance, 
mechanical strength and appearance, and therefore they have 
been used not only as various molding materials such as 
building materials, furniture and interior decoration 
materials, car parts and electric parts but also as optical 
materials and optical communication materials. Heretofore, as a preparation method of the methyl 
methacrylate polymer which has been used as the molding 
material, a suspension polymerization method has usually 
been employed, but in this method, the polymer is contaminated 
with a secondary material such as a suspending dispersant, 
and for this reason, it is difficult to obtain the 
high-purity polymer, and the polymer manufactured by this 
method is not suitable for the optical material or the 
like. Additionally, an after-treatment step for the polymer 
comprises intricate operations of filtration, washing 
and drying, and a large amount of waste water must be 
treated. Thus, the suspension polymerization method is  
 
still insufficient as an industrial process. As techniques 
which can overcome the drawbacks of this suspension polymerization 
method, much attention has been paid to a continuous 
mass polymerization method and a solution polymerization 
method in recent years. These methods permit the 
manufacture of high-quality resins having excellent optical 
properties, because the suspending dispersant or the like 
is not used. However, in the continuous mass polymerization 
method, it is very difficult owing to an autoacceleration 
effect called "the Trommsdorff effect" that a polymerization 
reaction is stably controlled, while a high monomer 
conversion is maintained, and hence the final polymer 
having a high polymer concentration is scarcely obtained. Japanese Patent Publication No. 32665/1977 (U.S. 
Patent No. 3,900,453) has suggested a continuous mass 
polymerization method in which a uniform phase reaction is 
carried out at a relatively low monomer conversion by the 
use of a tank type reactor and an unreacted monomer is 
continuously separated and removed. In this method, the 
unreacted monomer remains in large quantities, and for the 
collection and reuse of the unreacted monomer and for the 
concentration of the obtained
