<ABSTRACT>
A corner display counter is disclosed which has a 
display window (9) hinged on respective uprights (6a,b) 

about a non-perpendicular hinge axis to the uprights and 
elastic means (30), for balancing out at least part of the 

display window (9) weight, which are connected pivotally to 
the uprights with one (30a) of their ends and act on the 

display window with the intermediary of a feeler (32) 
pivoted to the corresponding upright (6a,b) and in either 

rubbing or rolling contact with the display window (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a corner display counter, 
in particular a refrigerated display window counter according 
to the preamble of claim 1. Display counters with the construction outlined above are 
known from the production line of this applicant as well as 
from DE-A-3411041. Such counters are usually fabricated in the form 
of modular assembly elements adapted to be laid side-by-side 
with other modular elements into a desired layout, or to be 
fitted with respective lateral sides and used separately, as 
desired. The term "corner display counter" as used herein 
encompasses both corner modular elements as used to assemble 
composite construction counters and the same elements as 
fitted with lateral sides and used separately. Composite construction display counters may 
include straight modules and corner modules, with the latter 
being either of the so-called open corner or closed corner 
type, these definitions being applicable to corner modules  
 
of a counter having a concave, respectively convex, front on 
their customer side. In accordance with the prior art, corner counters 
usually have, on their customer side, a display window with 
several glass panes, some of which are openable and some 
fixedly mounted. The need for plural glass panes, some of 
which are mounted not to be openable, is dictated by the 
current design of the hinges whereby the glass panes are 
attached, where possible, for swinging movement to 
respective ones of the counter uprights. The constructions 
of the counter and the hinges are such that the hinge axis 
about which each glass pane can be swung will lie 
substantially perpendicularly to the corresponding upright. Prior art display counters are usually provided, 
to facilitate swinging the glass panes to an open position 
of the display window, with elastic means such as gas 
springs which bias the display window to the open position 
by partly counterbalancing the weight of the glass panes. 
These gas springs have longitudinally opposite ends provided 
with respective eyes whereby they are pivoted to the 
uprights with one end and to the glass pane with the other, 
e.g. at the location of the second hinge member. The pivot 
axes of both ends are perpendicular to the longitudinal 
direction of the corresponding uprights. For reasons that 
will appear obvious, such pivot axes extend parallel to each 
other and to the hinge axis. Unless a separate pair of 
uprights are provided for each glass pane, therefore, it is 
impossible for display windows extending at a

<CLAIMS>
A corner display counter, comprising: 

a load-bearing structure (2), 
at least one pair of uprights (6a, 6b) extending in a longitudinal 
main direction and having one end attached to the load 

bearing-structure (2), said uprights carrying a respective 
hinge (10a, 10b) at the opposite end, said hinge (10a, 10b) including 

a first hinge member (11a, 11b) attached to a respective upright and 
articulated to a second hinge member (12a, 12b) for pivotal movement 

about a predetermined hinge axis (Xa, Xb), 
an openable display window (9) so attached to said second 
hinge members (12a, 12b) as to be swingable on said uprights 

(6a, 6b) about said hinge axis (Xa, Xb) toward and away from an open 
position, and 
elastic means (30) acting between at least one of the 
uprights and the display window to urge the display window 

towards said open position, said hinge axis (Xa, Xb) being set at 
an angle from a transverse direction of the uprights (6a, 6b), 

characterised in that a follower (32) is pivoted to the 
corresponding upright (6a, 6b) about a pivot axis (Ya, Yb) which 

is not parallel to said hinge axis (Xa, Xb), said follower being 
provided between the elastic means (30) and the display window 

(9) and said follower being in articulated relationship with 
said elastic means (30) and in sliding relationship with either 

rubbing or rolling contact with said display window (9). 
A counter according to Claim 1, wherein said 
follower (32) is in either rubbing or rolling contact with 

said display window through the second hinge member (12a, 12b). 
A counter according to either Claim 1 or 2, 
wherein each upright comprises two substantially parallel 

plate-like members (7), said hinge axis (Xa, Xb) being 
inclined from perpendicular to said plate-like members (7). 
A counter according to Claim 3, wherein the first 
hinge member comprises a wedge-shaped body (14), arranged  

 
for attachment to a respective upright (6a, 6b), with two 

opposite tapering faces (15,16), one of which is facing the 
corresponding plate-like member (7) and the other of which 

is perpendicular to said hinge axis (Xa, Xb). 
A counter according to Claim 4, wherein said 
wedge-shaped body (14) carries an arm (19) extending at 

right angles from the opposite face thereof to the 
plate-like member (7), said second hinge member including a 

clamp (20), clamped down onto said display window (9), and a 
bracket (24), rigid with the clamp (20), which is received 

and pivoted between said other face (16) of the wedge-shaped 
body (14) and said right-angle arm (19). 
A counter according to one or more of Claims 3 to 
5, wherein said elastic means include a plunger spring (30) 

received between said plate-like members (7) and pivotally 
connected thereto with one end (30a), said follower (32) being 

pivotally connected to said plate-like members and said 
spring about perpendicular axes to said plate-like members 

(7).
