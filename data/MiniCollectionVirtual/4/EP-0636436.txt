<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a process for forming, from a sheet-metal blank (1a), a lid (1), alternatively called top, comprising a peripheral rim (2) intended to be fixed to the edge of an opening of a container and at least one bump (step) (3) for stiffening the said lid. The process consists in holding the edge of the sheet-metal blank (1a) along its entire periphery and, in succession, in forming the said bump (3) and then in forming the peripheral rim (2). The subject of the invention is also a forming device for the implementation of the process and a metal lid obtained by this process.

Method of shaping, from a sheet metal blank (1a) 
of a lid (1), also known as a base, comprising a 

peripheral rim (2) intended to be fixed on the edge of 
an opening of a container, and at 
least one shoulder 
(3) for stiffening said lid, characterised in that the 

edge of the sheet metal blank (1a) is supported over 
its entire periphery and, successively, the said 

shoulder (3) is formed, and then the said peripheral 
rim (2) is formed. 
Device for shaping from a sheet metal blank (1a) 
of a lid (1), also known as a base, comprising a 

peripheral rim (2) intended to be fixed on the edge of 
an opening of a container, and at least one shoulder 

(3) for stiffening said lid (1), said device comprising 
a blank-holder (10) for the edge of the sheet metal 

blank (1a) over its entire periphery, shaping means 
(20) for the peripheral rim (2) comprising a die (21) 

adjacent to the blank-holder (10), and shaping means 
(30) for the said shoulder (3) comprising on the one 

hand a first mobile matrix (31) adjacent to the die 
(21) and, on the other hand, a second mobile matrix  

 
(32) disposed facing the first matrix (31), the faces 

(31a, 32a) opposite one another of these matrices (31, 
32) comprising imprints (33, 34) of complementary shape 

in order to shape said shoulder (3), said means (20, 
30) being distinct and displaceable independently of 

one another, characterised in that the first matrix 
(31) is supported and maintained by at least one 

compression means (14) in a raised position in which 
its imprint (33) is situated above the nose (21a) of 

the die (21), the said compression means (14) being 
calibrated for shaping the said shoulder (3) before 

shaping of said peripheral rim (2). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the die (21) forms a receiving means (13) for the first 

matrix (31) adjacent to the said die (21), the said 
compression means (14) being interposed between the 

base of the receiving means (13) and the first matrix 
(31). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that 
it comprises an ejector (15) for the shaped lid (1), 

situated opposite the die (21).
