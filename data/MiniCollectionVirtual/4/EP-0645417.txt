<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a biaxially oriented polypropylene film whose n-heptane-insoluble content has a chain isotacticity index, measured by 
<
13
>
C-NMR spectroscopy, of at least 95%. The base layer contains from 1 to 15% by weight of a natural or synthetic resin having a softening point of from 70 to 170 DEG C. The invention also relates to a process for the production of the polypropylene film and to the use thereof.
