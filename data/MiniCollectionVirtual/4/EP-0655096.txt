<ABSTRACT>
A fire-resistant material used in items such as sleeping bags, comforters, wearing apparel, upholstered furniture and mattress tops comprises a fiberfill batt and a layer of a fire-resistant aramid fiber contacting at least one side of the fiberfill batt. The fiberfill batt may comprise synthetic fiber, which may be either polyester fiber or polyolefin fiber. Alternatively, the fiberfill batt may comprise natural fiber. The aramid fiber layer may comprise poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) fiber, poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) fiber or a blend of poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) and poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) fiber. The aramid fiber layer may be needle-punched, hydroentangled, or laminated to the fiberfill batt.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE FIRE-RESISTANT MATERIAL COMPRISING A FIBERFILL BATT Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a fire-resistant material which may be used in items such as sleeping bags, comforters, wearing apparel, upholstered furniture or mattress tops. In particular, the present invention relates to a fire-resistant material comprising a fiberfill batt and an aramid fiber layer contacting the fiberfill batt. Description of the Related ArtFabrics made from poly (p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPD-T) or poly (m-phenylene isophthalamide) (MPD-I) are known for their fire- blocking qualities, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,994,317 to Dugan et al. However, these fabrics have very little insulation value. Fiberfill batts are often used as insulation in items such as wearing apparel, comforters and sleeping bags and as cushioning in upholstered furniture and mattress tops. These fiberfill batts usually have very little fire resistance. Moreover, it is often desirable to add a slickener, such as silicone, to a fiberfill batt to provide softness and resiliency to the batt, or a resin binder to stabilize the batt and make it more durable when washed. However, the addition of a slickener or a resin binder increases the flammability of the batt. One method for increasing the fire-resistance of polyester fiberfill is to blend fire-resistant fiber into the fiberfill batt. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,199,642 to Cooper et al. discloses that the addition of 2-20% by weight of aramid filamentary material to polyester fiberfill reduces the burning rate of the fiberfill. However, Cooper et al . does not impart a 

fire-blocking capability to the polyester fiberfill. Consequently, the polyester fiberfill of the Cooper et al. patent is allowed to burn, albeit at a reduced rate. In uses where the fiberfill is near the skin, such as wearing apparel, comforters and sleeping bags, this flame-retarding capability may not be adequate.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to impart fire-blocking capability to a fiberfill batt.Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.To achieve the foregoing objects, and in accordance with the purposes of the inventions as
