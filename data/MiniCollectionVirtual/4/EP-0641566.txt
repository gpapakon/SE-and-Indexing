<DESCRIPTION>
Vascular restenosis after percutaneous 
transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has been shown to 
be a tissue response characterized by an early and late 
phase. The early phase occuring hours to days after PTCA 
is due to thrombosis with some vasospasms while the late 
phase appears to be dominated by excessive proliferation 
and migration of smooth muscle cells. In this disease, the 
increased cell motility and colonization by smooth muscle 
cells and macrophages contribute significantly to the 
pathogenesis of the disease. The excessive proliferation 
and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells may be the 
primary mechanism to the reocclusion of coronary arteries 
following PTCA, atherectomy, laser angioplasty and arterial 
bypass graft surgery. See "Intimal Proliferation of Smooth 
Muscle Cells as an Explanation for Recurrent Coronary 
Artery Stenosis after Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary 
Angioplasty," Austin et al., Journal of the AmericanCollege of Cardiology 8: 369-375 (Aug. 1985). Vascular restenosis remains a major long term 
complication following surgical intervention of blocked 
arteries by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty 
(PTCA), atherectomy, laser angioplasty and arterial bypass 
graft surgery. In about 35% of the patients who undergo 
PTCA, reocclusion occurs within three to six months after 
the procedure. The current strategies for treating 
vascular restenosis include mechanical intervention by 
devices such as stents or pharmacologic therapies including 
heparin, low molecular weight heparin, coumarin, aspirin, 
fish oil, calcium antagonist, steroids, and prostacyclin. 
These strategies have failed to curb the reocclusion rate 
and have been ineffective for the treatment and prevention  
 
of vascular restenosis. See "Prevention of Restenosis after 
Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty: The Search 
for a 'Magic Bullet'," Hermans et al., American HeartJournal 122: 171-187 (July 1991). In the pathogenesis of restinosis excessive cell 
proliferation and migration occurs as a result of growth 
factors produced by cellular constituents in the blood and 
the damaged arterial vessel wall which mediate the 
proliferation of smooth muscle cells in vascular 
restenosis. Agents that inhibit the proliferation and/or 
migration of smooth muscle are useful in the treatment and 
prevention of restenosis. The present invention provides 
for the use of wortmannin and certain analogs as restenosis 
inhibitors. The invention provides a method of inhibiting 
restinosis in
