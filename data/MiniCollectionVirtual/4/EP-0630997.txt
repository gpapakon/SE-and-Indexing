<ABSTRACT>
A warp knitted composite fabric is provided comprising a 
frontal layer (1) of a warp knitted fabric and a rear layer 

(2) of another warp knitted fabric, where the two layers 
are arranged vis-a-vis at a given distance (W). The layers 

(1, 2) are coupled by a network of coupling yarns (3, 4) 
which are more firm and resilient than the yarns forming 

the front and rear layers (1, 2). In addition, the frontal 
layer of knitted fabric can contain a pile (25) to produce 

a nap (26) on the surface thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resilient material comprising
weft knitted fabrics and weft knitted composite fabric
comprising two fabric layers and designed for use as a
material for decorating both the interior and the exterior
of buildings, car, furniture, bags or the like. Knitting of this
type is known from DE-U-9 302 039.
While spongy elastic PVC sheets are popularly used for
decorating the interior and the exterior of buildings,
cars, furniture and bags, such sheets are not recyclable
and hence can give rise to environmental problems. A
Raschel fabric which is a warp knitted fabric has been
proposed as an alternative to a spongy elastic PVC sheet
but it is longitudinally not satisfactorily expandable and,
what is worse, costly. It will become even more costly when
it is processed for napping and hence less acceptable as an
alternative to the spongy elastic PVC sheet.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide at relatively low cost a weft knitted fabric made
of recyclable yarns and having a satisfactory expandability
both longitudinally and laterally and an excellent nappy
touch such that it may be suitably used as an interior or
exterior material in a variety of applications.According to the present invention, the above object of the
invention is achieved by providing a resilient material
comprising a frontal layer of a weft knitted fabric and a
rear layer made of another weft knitted fabric, said weft
knitted fabrics being arranged vis-a-vis with a given
distance separating them from each other and coupled by a 
network of coupling yarns, said coupling yarns being more
firm and resilient than the yarns of the frontal and rear
layers, said coupling yarns including S-twist yarns and
Z-twist yarns arranged alternately.Since the pair of weft knitted fabrics of a resilient
material according to the invention are arranged in two
layers,a frontal layer and a rear layer, that are coupled
together by a network of coupling yarns including S-twist
yarns and Z-twist yarns arranged alternately, said coupling
yarns being more firm and resilient than the yarns of the
two weft knitted fabrics in order to constantly maintain
the distance between the two weft knitted fabrics equal to
the distance between any two adjacent interlocking points
of each coupling yarn, the oppositely directed torques of
the coupling yarns generated by the oppositely twisted
yarns makes the network of coupling yarns rigid enough to
constantly separate the frontal and rear layers such that,
if the resilient material is
