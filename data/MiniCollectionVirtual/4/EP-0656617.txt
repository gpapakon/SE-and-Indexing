<ABSTRACT>
In a procedure for subpixel shifting in the scanning direction 
of a color image on a display, a weighted mean value for the 

color intensity of the new pixel and the preceding pixel is 
formed for each image dot according to the magnitude of 

subpixel shifting. In a device for subpixel shifting in the 
scanning direction of a color image on a display, delayed 

pixel data can be supplied to a color palette unit across a 
first input and non-delayed pixel data across a second input. 

The color palette unit is arranged to determine, for each 
image dot, a weighted mean value for the color intensity of 

the delayed and non-delayed pixel by table look-up according 
to a predetermined algorithm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure and a device for 
subpixel positioning in the sweep direction of a color image 
on a display. In EP,A,0 473 142 a procedure is described for smoothing steps 
or discontinuities in an image formed by a dot matrix and is 
applied to a laser printer, LED printer or a CRT display. 
Here, a pixel is subdivided into a plurality of subpixels 
along a vertical or horizontal scanning direction, and one or 
more signals intended for subpixels is/are reversed in a 
desired manner so the current pixel is smoothed with 
information in adjacent pixels. When an image is scrolled, e.g. ECG tracings, in the scanning 
direction, the moving image will be jerky unless the image is 
moved a specific number of pixels in the scanning direction 
each time the image is exchanged. If you want display scannig times of e.g. 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 
20.0 seconds and there are 1,000 pixels in the scanning 
direction, the images can be moved 8, 4, 2, 1 pixel for a 
monitor image frequency of 50 Hz. This results in shifts of 
400, 200, 100 and 50 pixels per second, and the ratios 
400/1000, 200/1000, 100/1000 and 50/1000 yield the right 
scanning times. If the monitor image frequency is changed to e.g. 60 Hz with 
the same scanning times as above, the frame must be moved with 
an accuracy better than 1 pixel, more precisely it must be 
moved with
 
   6.67 pixels for a sweep time of 2.5 seconds
 
   3.3 pixels for a sweep time of 5.0 seconds
 
 
   1.67 pixels for a sweep time of 10.0 seconds
 
   0.83 pixels for with a sweep time of 20.0 seconds.
 
The object of the present invention is to propose a procedure 
and provide a device for solving the aforementioned problems 
and make possible movement of the image with optional 
accuracy, i.e. image movement with an optional fraction of a 
pixel. This object is achieved with a procedure according to claim 1 
and a device according to claim 2. According to the invention therefore, a weighted mean value of 
the color intensity of the new pixel and the old pixel is 
determined for each image dot each time the image changes, 
the weighting being determined by the magnitude of the 
fraction of a pixel by which the image is moved, i.e. it is 
determined by the size of the desired subpixel movement. Thus 
a resolution better than one pixel is obtained. According to one advantageous embodiment of the device 
according to the invention, four color intensity tables or 
matrices are stored in the color palette unit's memory, each 
table or matrix comprising
