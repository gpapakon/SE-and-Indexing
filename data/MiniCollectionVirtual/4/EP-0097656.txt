<ABSTRACT>
Electrical conductors (Figures 2 and 4) having enhanced properties (such as increased electrical and thermal conductivity and improved surface characteristics for wire bonding and edge connector insertion in an edge connector) are prepared by applying a mixture (101) of a metallic powder and a polymer on a substrate (100), curing the polymer, effecting an augmentative replacement reaction to replace some of the metallic powder with a more noble metal to form a contiguous layer of a conducting metal (102) on the substrate and thereafter electroplating an additional metal layer (103, 104) on the contiguous layer. Principal use is in manufacture of printed circuits.

 ELECTROPLATED AUGMENTATIVE REPLACEMENT PROCESSED CONDUCTORS AND MANUFACTURE THEREOF RELATED APPLICATIONS ;This application is related to co-pending applications Serial Nos. 220,331, 220,341, 220,342, 220,343, 220,244 and 220,937, all filed December 29, 1980, and Serial No. 220,332 filed March 11 ,. 1981. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMany types of electronic apparatus are known in which the various electrical components are interconnected by conductors. The intercon¬ necting conductors are fabricated in a wide variety of processes such as, for example, thick- film fired conductor systems, polymer conductors and printed circuit boards. 

 In thick-film fired conductors, a mixture of a conducting metal powder, a ceramic or glass binder and an appropriate vehicle is screen print¬ ed on a substrate. The conductor pattern on the substrate is then fired at a relatively high temperature, typically between 650° and 900°C. As the temperature rises to the firing temperature, the vehicle is volatilized, leaving the metal and binder behind. At the firing temperature, sinter¬ ng of the metal takes place to a greater or lesser extent with the binder providing adhesion between the metal film formed and the substrate.Thick-film fired conductors have classi¬ cally employed precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium. Recently these noble metals have soared in cost, and new conduc¬ tor systems using copper, nickel and aluminum are being made commercially available. The cost of the precious metal systems is prohibitive where a low cost conductor system is desired. The newer metal systems are not s gnificantly cheaper because of the special chemistry which is required to prevent oxidation of the metal during the fir¬ ing process. Moreover, these systems are very difficult to solder using the conventional tin/ lead solder and the high firing temperatures 

 required during fabrication preclude the use of low cost substrate materials. Some of the nickel systems can be fired on a soda-lime glass at temperatures just below the melting point of the glass but the resulting conductivity of the conductor is relatively low.The term "polymer conductor" is actually a misnomer since the polymer is not actually a conductor. Instead, the polymer is heavily loaded with a conducting metal and screened onto a sub¬ strate. The advantage of this system is that the polymer can be cured either catalytical ly or ther¬ mally at temperatures which range from room temperature to about 125°C, As a result of this so-called "cold
