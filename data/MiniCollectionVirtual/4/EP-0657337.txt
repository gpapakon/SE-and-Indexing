<ABSTRACT>
In order to electrically adjust the sensing range of a hot-box locating system, the signal of a first receiver coil (13) of a wheel sensor (3) is logically connected to a fixed value ( DELTA u) so that the point of intersection (15) of the signal profile with the signal of a second receiver coil (12) of the wheel sensor (3) is displaced and can be used as a criterion for the resolution of a measuring process.

A method for determining the scanning region of vehicle-actuated
measuring means such as, e.g., hot box detection

means (4), wherein a wheel sensor (3) is equipped with a
transmitter (11) and two receivers arranged on both sides of

the transmitter, by comparing the signals of the two receivers
and effecting a measurement as a function of the result of the

comparison of said signals, characterized in that an adjustable
constant signal is electrically added to, or subtracted

from, at least one of the signals of the receivers (12, 13) of
a wheel sensor (3) and said measurement is effected as a

function of the evaluation of the comparison of the thus
obtained signals of the receivers (12, 13) of the wheel sensor

(3).
A device for adjusting and setting measuring means (4) on
tracks relative to wheel sensors (3a, 3b), comprising a base

plate (2) to which the wheel sensors are fixed, and the
measuring means are fixable, at a geometrically defined mutual

distance, the wheel sensors each including a transmitter coil
(11) and two associated receiver coils (12, 13), characterized

in that at least one voltage signal of a receiver coil (12) is
fed to a computing circuit forming a modified signal of the

voltage signal of the receiver coil on its output, and that
the output signal of the computing circuit as well as the

voltage signal of the second receiver coil (13) are fed to a
comparator whose output signal is connectable to the measuring

means.
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the
computing circuit is configured as an adding circuit adding

to, or subtracting from, the input signal an adjustable
voltage value and/or is configured as a multiplication or

quotient circuit multiplying with an ajustable factor or
dividing by the same. 
A device according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that
the computing circuit comprises an operational amplifier, to

whose inputs is transmitted the signal of a receiver coil
(13), on the one hand, and is connected a voltage source

having an adjustable voltage, on the other hand.
