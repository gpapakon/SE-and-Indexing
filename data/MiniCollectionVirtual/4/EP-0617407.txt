<ABSTRACT>
The file uses an integrated head-suspension 
assembly (22) having a head carrier (24) with a dual-layer 

wear pad (30) for contacting 
the disk (12) during read and write operations. 

The outer wear layer (50) of the 
pad is relatively soft and wear prone compared to a harder and more wear-resistant 

inner layer (52). The outer wear layer wears away at a relatively 
rapid rate during initial wear-in of the head carrier. In this manner 

the head pole pieces (40,42), which extend 
into the wear pad, are rapidly put 

into contact with the disk, thereby compensating for initial misalignment 
of the wear pad with the surface of the disk. The inner wear layer then 

provides wear resistance over the life of the disk file. In the 
preferred embodiment, both the outer and inner wear layers are formed of 

essentially amorphous carbon doped with different amounts of hydrogen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to contact recording disk files (or 
"drives"), where the recording transducer (or "head") is in contact with 
the magnetic recording disk during read and write operations. In conventional noncontact rigid disk files, each of the read/write 
heads is supported on a carrier (or "slider") which rides on a cushion or 
bearing of air above the surface of its associated disk when the disk is 
rotating at its operating speed. The slider is connected to a linear or 
rotary actuator by means of a relatively fragile suspension. There may 
be a stack of disks in the disk file with the actuator supporting a 
number of sliders. The actuator moves the sliders radially so that each 
head may access the recording area of its associated disk surface. In 
these conventional disk files, the slider is biased toward the disk 
surface by a small force from the suspension. The slider is in contact 
with the disk surface from the time the disk file is turned on until the 
disk reaches a speed sufficient to cause the slider to ride on the air 
bearing, and again when the disk file is turned off and the rotational 
speed of the disk falls below that necessary to create the air bearing. In addition to the above-described conventional magnetic recording 
disk files, "contact" recording rigid disk files have been proposed 
wherein the head is in contact or near contact with the disk during read 
and write operations. Contact recording disk files have the advantage of 
much closer head-disk spacing and its associated improved writing 
efficiency, read signal response and corresponding storage densities. In 
one type of contact recording, sometimes referred to as "dry" contact 
recording to distinguish it from liquid-bearing contact recording, the 
disk file uses a head assembly in which the head carrier and suspension 
are formed as an integrated unit and the head carrier makes physical 
contact with the disk surface during read and write operations. In this 
type of head suspension, as described for example in U.S. Patent 
5,041,932, a portion of the head pole piece and head carrier actually 
wear away due to frictional contact with the disk over the life of the 
disk file. Unfortunately, in this type of disk file it is extremely 
difficult to assemble the disk file so that the head pole piece is 
perfectly aligned and in complete contact with the disk. Thus, it is 
necessary to either develop manufacturing processes with improved 
tolerances or to operate the disk file for an initial wear-in period to
