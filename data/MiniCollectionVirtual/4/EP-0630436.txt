Blade apparatus having horizontal and vertical 
control for continuously advancing open trenches in the 

ground, having lining elements which support the side 
walls (2) of the trench, are arranged one on top of the 

other, are longitudinally displaceable with respect to 
one another in the advancing direction and each have a 

pair of blades (6), located opposite one another, for 
bearing against and supporting the side walls (2) of the 

trench and two transverse supports (8) by means of which 
the blades (6) of the pair of blades (6) are connected to 

one another to form a framework, the blades (6) which lie 
one on top of the other of two lining elements which are 

arranged adjacently one on top of the other are each 
connected to one another via at least one advancing press 

(20), the connection point of each advancing press (20) 
with the respectively upper blade (6) and the connection 

point with the respectively lower blade (6) being 
arranged offset horizontally with respect to one another, 

characterized in that there are at least three lining 
elements on which the last two pairs of blades (6) which 

are nearest to the bottom (4) of the trench are supported 
on the bottom (4) of the trench by means of supporting 

devices, in each case, and the supporting devices each 
comprise four hydraulically activated presses (24). 
Blade apparatus according to Claim 1, in which 
the first transverse support (8) is arranged in the 

region between the blade head (10) and blade body (14) of 
the blade (6) and the second transverse support (8) is 

arranged in the region between the blade body (14) and  
 

blade tail (12) of the blade (6). 
Blade apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, in 
which the transverse supports (8) are constructed so as 

to be longitudinally adjustable with respect to their 
longitudinal axes. 
Blade apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, in which spacing devices, which are connected to the 

underside, facing the bottom (4) of the trench, of the 
respective upper blades (6) and which merely rest on the 

upper side, facing away from the bottom (4) of the 
trench, of the respective adjacent lower blade (6), are 

arranged between the blades (6) which are arranged one on 
top of the other. 
Blade apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, in which guide devices are formed in each case on the 

upper side, facing away from the bottom (4) of the 
trench, of the blades (6), which guide devices interact 

with the spacinq devices in such a way that the blades 
(6) which rest against one side wall (2) of the trench 

are aligned essentially in a common vertical plane. 
Blade apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, in which the advancing presses (20) are arranged on 

the blades (6), lying one on top of the other, in the 
region between the blade head (10) and blade body (14) of 

one blade (6) and in the region between the blade body 

(14) and blade tail (12) of the other blade (6), in 
particular in the region between the transverse supports 

(8). 
Blade apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 
6, in which the blades (6), arranged one on top of the 

other, of the last two pairs of blades (6) which are 
nearest to the bottom (4) of the trench are connected to 

one another via two advancing presses (20). 
Blade apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 
7, in which, in the case of the last pairs of blades (6) 

which are nearest to the bottom (4) of the trench, two 
presses (24) are arranged in each case in the region 

between the blade head (10) and blade body (14), and two 
presses (24) are arranged in the region between the blade  

 
body (14) and blade tail (12). 
Blade apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 
8, in which the surface, facing the side wall (2) of the 

trench, of the blade (6) is constructed in the end region 
of the blade head (10) bent towards the centre of the 

trench, and a displacement component (32) is arranged on 
the surface which runs obliquely towards the side wall 

(2) of the trench, lies opposite the said side wall (2), 
and forms the tip of the blade head (10), the free end of 

the displacement component (32) forming the tip of the 
blade head (10).
