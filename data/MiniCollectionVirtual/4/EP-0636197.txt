<ABSTRACT>
A module for constructing a modular bridge suitable for use in both a dry span and a floating role comprising a bouyant structure (32) having interconnection means (6, 10, 11, 8, 3, 13, 12, 37,14) for connecting the module end to end to an adjacent similar module to form a bridge and having one or more link members (4) which are releasably securable to the underside of the bridge module (1) by link securing means (not shown in figure 1). Each link is provided at one end with a double limb connection member (18) and at the other with a complementary single limb connection member, both provided with holes (20) for insertion of a pin to connect two links from adjacent bridge modules together. The releasably securable link members (4) are removed from a bridge assembled for a floating role to reduce redundant weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to modules for constructing modular bridges which 
are designed to be used in both a dry span role and as floating bridges. Where there is a requirement to transport a bridge to a particular location and 
construct it in a short time such as in military operations or in response to a civil disaster 
modular bridges comprising interconnectable modules are often used. A reinforced 
modular bridge is disclosed in patent US-A-3 504 389, however such a bridge is only 
suitable for use for a dry span role. In order to increase the versatility of such bridges 
they are sometimes designed to be used either in a dry span role or alternatively as 
floating bridges. Such a design has the added advantage that the bridge can also be used 
as a ferry. An example of such a bridge is referred to at page 110 of Jane's Military 
Vehicles and Logistics 1991. As the bridge must have sufficient flexural rigidity when 
used in the dry span role there is a certain amount of structural redundancy when the 
bridge is used as a floating bridge or ferry as the natural buoyancy of the bridge supports 
the majority of the weight of the bridge and any payload borne by the bridge. The 
consequence of this redundancy is that the weight of the bridge is unnecessarily high when 
the bridge is afloat and the load that the bridge can support when afloat is 
accordingly reduced. US Patent 3 499 179 discloses a bridge comprising a plurality of 
box like sections connectable end to end and which may be used in either a dry span role 
or as a floating bridge with the addition of pneumatic floats. The object of the invention is to provide a module for a modular bridge which can 
be used to build a bridge for use in the dry span role or alternatively as a floating bridge 
and which does not suffer from the disadvantage described above. Thus according to the invention there is provided a bridge module comprising a 
buoyant structure with at least one end having module interconnection means for connecting 
the module end to end to an adjacent module so as to form a bridge comprising a plurality of 
said modules characterised in that the module further comprises at least one link member  
 
with link connection means and link securing means the or each link 
member being releasably securable to the buoyant structure by the link 
securing means and being longitudinally connectable to a link member 
of an adjacent module via the link connection means to support tensile 
forces experienced by a bridge comprising a
