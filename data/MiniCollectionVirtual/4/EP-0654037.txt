<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns acyclic nucleotide
analogs, their preparation and use. In particular it
concerns separate enantiomers of 2-phosphonomethoxypropyl
derivatives of purine and pyrimidine bases.There is an urgent need for development of
chemotherapeutic agents in the therapy of viral diseases.
In particular treatment of diseases caused by
retroviruses presents one of the most difficult
challenges in human medicine. While a number of
antiviral agents which are registered or are currently
under study can effectively cure disease, relieve
symptoms or substantially prolong the intervals among the
recurrences of certain chronic viral infections, such
positive outcomes have not yet been achieved in many
instances, notably that of AIDS, as an example of
retroviral disease. Selectivity of antiviral action,
which is an important requirement for novel antiviral
agents, has not been achieved.Most of the compounds which are clinically
useful for antiviral chemotherapy are nucleosides,
modified in either the purine or pyrimidine base and/or
the carbohydrate moiety. Such compounds mainly act in
processes related to the synthesis of viral nucleic
acids; their action depends on ability to undergo
phosphorylation and subsequent transformation to the 
triphosphates. One problem in administering modified
nucleosides is the absence of suitable phosphorylating
activity in the host cell and the existence of viral
strains lacking virus-specific phosphorylating activity.
While enzymatically resistant nucleotide analogs might
appear to be particularly useful as potential antivirals,
their polar character prevents effective entry of these
analogs into the cells, as does lack of appropriate
nucleotide receptors at the cellular membrane.This difficulty appears to be overcome in the
series of acyclic nucleotide analogs which contain an
aliphatic chain, bearing hydroxyl groups, replacing the
sugar moiety. For example, the phosphates or phosphonic
acid derivatives derived from the antiviral nucleoside
analog ganciclovir (Cytovene) are reported to possess an
anti-herpes virus activity (Reist at al., in "Nucleotide
Analogs as Antiviral Agents", ACS Symposium Series, No.
401, pp. 17-34 (1989); Tolman, ibid, pp. 35-50; Prisbe et
al., J Med Chem (1986), 29:671).The following formulas describe several classes
of prior art compounds:
Another group of antiviral compounds where the
antiviral action is less strictly limited by the nature
of the heterocyclic base includes phosphonic acid analogs
in which a phosphonic acid moiety is linked to
