<ABSTRACT>
A recording apparatus for performing recording 
with an ink jet recording head capable of ejecting ink 

on to a recording medium is disclosed. The recording 
apparatus includes an ink receiving section disposed at 

a position to be able to oppose an orifice-formed face 
of said recording head, a preliminary ejection unit for 

causing ink ejection from discharging orifices toward 
said ink receiving section by driving said recording 

head to remove causes of defective ink ejection, dry 
absorption unit for absorbing ink remaining in said 

ink receiving section as a result of ink ejection by 
said preliminary ejection unit, and dry ejection control 

unit for causing ink absorption by driving said dry 
absorption unit when the number of times of ejection by 

said preliminary ejection unit exceeds a predetermined 
number after absorption previously executed by said 

dry absorption unit during recording.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording apparatus for performing
recording using an ink jet recording head.There are various recording apparatuses, which
record on recording media such as paper and OHP sheet
(hereinafter referred to as recording paper or merely paper).
These recording apparatus have a recording head.
The recording head operates on one of various systems such as the
wire dot system, heat-sensitive system, heat transfer system
and ink jet system.Among these recording systems, the ink jet system
ejects ink directly toward the recording paper.
Therefore, its running costs are low and it is
a quiet recording system.The ink jet recording system generally
uses a recording head having an array of fine ink discharging
orifices. Therefore, when it is desired for the head to have
a long operational life, capping is carried out in order to prevent 
air bubbles and dust entering the discharge
orifices or to prevent ink from becoming defectively
ejectable and unsuitable for recording due to increase of its
viscosity resulting from solvent evaporation. The
capping is carried out by providing a cap which can
cover a discharge orifice face of the recording head when the
recording head is not in use.However, when a defective ejection state as
noted above is produced in spite of capping or when discharge
orifices which are not or are less frequently used
become defectively ejectable during a recording operation,
it is effective to refresh the ink to remove the cause of such
defective ejection. This process is referred to as an
"ejection recovery process".In one form of ejection recovery
process, ink ejection energy generators provided
inside the discharge orifices of the recording head are
driven to cause ejection of ink from all the discharging
orifices toward the cap used for the capping noted above.
This ejection is hereinafter referred to as "preliminary
ejection". This is done for the purpose of removing the
cause of defective ejection together with ink. An ink absorbing
member is provided inside the cap opposing the discharge 
orifices to prevent leakage or spattering of
ink ejected from the discharge orifices during the
preliminary ejection.Further, a pump is provided in communication with and to
provide an absorbing force to the cap. The pump serves to
absorb ink remaining in the cap after preliminary ejection
(the absorption being hereinafter referred to as
"dry absorption") thus preventing deterioraton of the ink absorption
capacity or a reduction in the ink absorbing force due to solidification
of
