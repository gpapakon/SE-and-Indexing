<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for ensuring secure communication over an unsecured communications medium between a user working on an unsecured workstation or computer and a host computer. A secure user interface is created by inserting a trusted path subsystem between input/output devices to the workstation and the workstation itself. Data transferred from the input/output devices is intercepted, encrypted and transmitted in packets to the host computer. Packets of screen display data from the host computer are decrypted and presented within a user-defined screen overlay.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TRUSTED PATH SUBSYSTEM FOR WORKSTATIONSBackground of the InventionField of the InventionThe present invention relates to an apparatus and method for providing a trusted computer system based on untrusted computers, and more particularly to an apparatus and method for providing a trusted path mechanism between a user node based on an untrusted computer or workstation and a trusted subsystem.Background Information Advances in computer and communications technology have increased the free flow of information within networked computer systems. While a boon to many, such a free flow of information can be disastrous to those systems which process sensitive or classified information. In response to this threat, trusted computing systems have been proposed for limiting access to classified information to those who have a sufficient level of clearance. Such systems depend on identifying the user, authenticating (through password, biometrics, etc.) the user's identity and limiting that user's access to files to those files over which he or she has access rights. In addition, a trusted path mechanism is provided which guarantees that a communication path established between the Trusted Computer Base (TCB) and the user cannot be emulated or listened to by malicious hardware or software. Such a system is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,621,321; 4,713,753; and 4,701,840 granted to Boebert et al. and assigned to the present assignee, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.The last decade has marked a shift in the distributing of computational resources. Instead of connecting a large number of relatively "dumb" terminals to a mainframe computer, the automatic data processing 

environment has gradually shifted to where a large number of current systems are file server systems. In a file server system, relatively low cost computers are placed at each user's desk while printers and high capacity data storage devices are located near the server or servers. Files stored in the high capacity data storage devices are transferred to the user's computer for processing and then either saved in local storage or transferred back to the storage devices. Documents to be printed are transferred as files to a print server; the print server then manages the printing of the document.An even more loosely coupled distributed computing approach is based on the client-server paradigm. Under the client-server paradigm, one or more client processes operating on a user's workstation gain access to one or more
