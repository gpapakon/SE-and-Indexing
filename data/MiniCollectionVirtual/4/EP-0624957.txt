<ABSTRACT>
An antenna input receiving circuit, which is to be used 
in coupled between an antenna and at least one tuning circuit 

(5/7) for supplying the tuning circuit (5/7) with an RF 
signal received by the antenna (1), includes an active 

element (3a/3b) coupled between the antenna (1) and the 
tuning circuit (5/7) and a detector (19, 20) for detecting 

the electric field intensity of the RF signal received by the 
antenna (1) to control the conductance of the active element 

(3a/3b) in response to the detected electric field intensity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antenna input 
receiving circuit for using in associated with TV receivers 
or the like to be used in vehicles. In recent years, a competition for a miniaturization or a 
cost-cutting of car receiver equipments such as car TV 
receivers is becoming increasingly fierce. Thus many 
improvements of components or parts which are used for 
constructing the car receiver equipments has been 
increasingly required. Referring now to FIGURE 1, a conventional car TV receiver 
will be explained. As shown in FIGURE 1, a conventional car TV receiver 31 
is typically mounted on a dash-board in vehicles together 
with a car radio receiver 32. An RF relay switch 33 is 
mounted at a section associated to the car TV receiver 31 as 
a part of an antenna input circuit, for selectively inputting 
RF signals received by an antenna 34 to another section 
associated to the car radio receiver 32 or the section 
associated to the car TV receiver 31. The RF relay switch 33 has advantageously a very low 
insertion loss, so that the RF relay switch 33 is able to 
sufficiently isolate circuits coupled to the antenna with 
each other. Due to the above advantage, the RF antenna 33 
has become widely used in recent years, in spite of the RF 
relay switch 33 being relatively expensive for processing the 
RF signals.  As though such car TV receivers are used in a state 
mounted in cars or vehicles as their name implies, the car TV 
receivers are so designed to be able to receive radio waves 
in the best condition even if the vehicle is moving. That 
is, an adequate receiving remedy is applied to receiving 
circuits such as an electronic tuner 35 or an IF detector 36 
to obtain a stable receiving performance over a wide range of 
field intensity from a weak electric field input to a strong 
electric field input. It is therefore important to secure an 
interference rejection characteristic or an AGC 
characteristic for the car receiver equipments or the car TV 
receivers. Thus, the electronic tuner 33 is generally 
comprised of high-quality filters or high power gain ICs. By the way, in recent years the competition of the 
miniaturization or the cost-cutting grows more and more 
intense at the market of the car TV receivers. Thus the 
miniaturization or the cost-cutting must be accomplished with 
maintaining basic performances of the receivers when they are 
newly put on the market. However, in practical situations the miniaturization or 
the cost-cutting of the car TV receivers do not meet 
expectations
