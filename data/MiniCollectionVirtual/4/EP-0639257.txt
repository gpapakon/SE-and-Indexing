An industrial furnace with roller elements and 
associated conveying surfaces for conveying bars or 

pallets carrying material for firing, in which the roller 
elements (1, 6, 11, 16, 22, 31, 36) are made of high 

temperature ceramics such as silicon carbide, silicon 
carbide alloy, aluminium oxide or any other comparable 

material, or a high temperature resistant steel or steel 
alloy, and are cylindrical or spherical in shape, 

characterised in that the roller elements and the 
associated conveying surfaces for 
the bars or pallets are 
positioned alongside the inner walls of the furnace, and 

in that at least one conveying surface has an L- or H-shape 
profile for lateral control of the roller 

elements. 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 1 characterised in 
that the conveying surfaces are rails positioned on the 

inner walls of the furnace and in that the roller 
elements are integral with the undersides of the bars or 

pallets. 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 1 characterised in 
that the conveying surfaces are on the undersides of the 

bars or pallets and in that the roller elements are 
positioned on the inner walls of the furnace.  

 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 1 characterised in 
that at least two firing channels are positioned adjacent 

one another, separator elements such as support frames 
being located between the firing channels, and in that 

the conveying surfaces are positioned both along the 
inner walls of the furnace and along the separator 

elements. 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 1 characterised in 
that a plurality of roller elements (6, 11, 16) are 

positioned so as to be capable of moving freely in a 
longitudinal direction between at least two parallel 

rails (7, 12, 19) each having a U-shape profile and 
extending at the same height along the length of an 

industrial furnace with the lateral arms of the said 
rails pointing upwards, in that the pallets (10, 15) rest 

on the roller elements (6, 11, 16), and in that spacer 
elements in the form of disks (18), balls or cylindrical 

bodies (17) are arranged between the roller elements 
(16), the height of the said spacer elements being less 

than half the diameter of the roller elements (16). 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 5 characterised in 
that the roller elements (16) are conveyed from the 

furnace at the furnace exit by means of rails (84) which 
are enclosed on all sides, and are returned to the 

furnace entrance in a continuous cycle.  
 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 1 characterised in 
that the roller elements (1, 36) include axial through 

holes (2) into which are inserted axles (3, 37) or hollow 
axles. 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 7 characterised in 
that the axles of at least two roller elements (22) are 

mounted laterally on the underside of pallets (29) or 
bars by means of which roller elements (22) are arranged 

on each of the inwardly facing sides of the furnace, and 
in that the pallets (29) or bars, together with the 

roller elements (22) are mounted so as to be capable of 
moving along shaped rails (23, 26) laterally positioned 

in the walls (25, 28) of the industrial furnace and/or 
along additional centrally-located cross beams. 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 3 characterised in 
that a plurality of roller elements (36) is rotatably 

mounted in a series of parallel supporting blocks (38) 
which are arranged at the same height in the side walls 

of the furnace. 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 9 characterised in 
that the supporting blocks (38) are positioned on the 

ends of lead-in pipes (40) which are retractably mounted 
in openings in the furnace wall (39). 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 10 characterised  
 

in that the lead-in pipes (40) are mounted in rectangular 
muffles (41) inserted into the openings, the said lead-in 

pipes (40) being of a smaller diameter than the clearance 
height of the muffles (41) and being movable from an 

upper position in the muffle to a position below the said 
first position and vice versa, at least in the region of 

the supporting blocks (38) and by means of underlying 
wedges (42, 43) which can be slid together. 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 3 characterised in 
that a plurality of cylindrical roller elements (31) with 

through holes (33), in each case at a clearance distance 
from each other, are positioned on rails (32) running 

within the industrial furnace, connecting members (34) 
being arranged between two roller elements in each case 

which engage in the through holes (33) at their ends, and 
in that the roller elements (31) that are linked together 

in this way in the form of a chain are turned around at 
the ends of the rails (32) and directed back beneath the 

said rails to form a cyclic roller chain. 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 3 characterised in 
that a plurality of roller elements (55) are arranged 

around a circuit located within a casing (57) which is 
open at the top, the said circuit being partially 

straight, at least on its upper section, and rounded at 
the sides, cylindrical spacer bodies (56) which are 

aligned parallel to the axis being, in each case,  
 

arranged between two roller elements (55) and where there 
are always at least two roller elements (55) in the open 

part of the casing (57) protruding at the same height 
above the said casing and forming the seat for the firing 

material carriers (68), several casings (57) being 
arranged at the same height on the walls of the 

industrial furnace. 
An industrial furnace as in any one of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the firing chamber or firing 

chambers (133) stand on a support frame (132) positioned 
on the floor (131), the space (136) beneath the firing 

chambers (133) being accessible on foot. 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 14 characterised 
in that the furnace floor is divided up into segments 

(134) which can be moved along the casing (132) on 
conveyor surfaces such as slide rails (140). 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 1 characterised in 
that the material (105, 118) for firing is suspended by 

means of recesses or projections from one or a plurality 
of appropriately shaped bars (108). 
An industrial furnace as in Claim 1 characterised in 
that the shaped rails (119) are suspended by means of one 

or a plurality of intermediate brackets (113) or 
connecting elements in the upper part of the inner walls  

 
of the furnace, or by means of intermediate elements, or 

on the ceiling of the furnace (110) itself.
