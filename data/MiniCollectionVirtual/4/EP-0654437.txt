<ABSTRACT>
A machine for cleaning cops or supports (4) of spools 
of thread for the textile industry comprising means (3) for 

axially locking the cop or support of a spool to be cleaned 
and means (5) for scraping the residual thread (6) wound on 

the cop or support (4). The scraping means (5) are movable 
along the lateral surface of the cop or support (4) along a 

direction which has a component that is axial with respect 
to the cop or support (4) for the gradual axial removal of 

the residual thread (6) from the cop or support (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for cleaning 
cops or supports of spools of thread for the textile 
industry, particularly for cleaning frustum-shaped cops, 
cops or supports for "Soleil" spools, and "Ring" cops. It is known that textile machines are supplied with 
spools of thread constituted by a preset amount of thread 
wound around a cop or central support. During weaving, 
accidental breakage of the thread while the machine is being 
supplied may interrupt the supply of thread before the spool 
is depleted. If the thread breaks when the spool is almost 
fully used up, there is no economical advantage in using the 
remaining part of thread, and usually the spool is removed 
and replaced with a new spool of thread. Due to this fact, in the textile industry there is the 
problem of cleaning cops or supports of thread spools before 
the spooling by means of which the support or cop of the 
spool is loaded with fresh thread. One of the various technologies currently in use to 
perform this cleaning operation consists in cutting the 
residual threads by means of a blade which is made to slide 
axially along the lateral surface of the cop. The threads 
thus cut can be easily removed from the cop or support, 
which is thus ready for reuse. However, this technique is complicated, since the cut 
should preferably not affect the cop so as to avoid 
producing alterations or damage that might compromise its 
life and at the same time might also damage the thread 
subsequently wound on the cop. This technique is furthermore  
 
difficult to apply to the cleaning of perforated cops, since 
the thread can penetrate the holes of the cop as a 
consequence of the pressure applied by the blade and 
therefore escape the action of said blade, making it 
extremely difficult to remove the thread from the cop or 
support. Another technique for cleaning cops or spool supports 
consists in cutting the threads by means of a jet of air, 
heated to a high temperature, which is capable of melting 
the residual threads struck by such a jet. Of course this 
technique can be used only to clean cops or supports that 
hold synthetic threads. Another technique currently in use adopts particular 
cops having, along their lateral surface, a slot that runs 
parallel to one of the directrices of said lateral surface, 
and consists in cutting the residual threads by means of a 
blade that enters said slot. Although this technique 
preserves the integrity of the cops or supports without 
using sophisticated devices, it has the

<CLAIMS>
Machine for cleaning cops or supports of spools of 
thread for the textile industry, characterized in that it 

comprises means for axially locking the cop or support of a 
spool to be cleaned and means for scraping the residual 

thread wound on said cop or support, said scraping means 
being movable along the lateral surface of said cop or 

support along a direction which has a component that is 
axial with respect to said cop or support for the gradual 

axial removal of the residual thread from said cop or 
support. 
Machine according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said scraping means comprise teeth that move by control 

means along directions which are substantially parallel to 
directrices of the lateral surface of said cop or support 

and means for pushing said teeth towards the axis of said 
cop or support. 
Machine according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said scraping means comprise teeth 

which move by control means along the lateral surface of 
said cop or support and make contact with two diametrically 

mutually opposite regions of said cop or support. 
Machine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said scraping means comprise 

at least two chains a portion of which faces two 
diametrically opposite regions of the lateral surface of 

said cop or support, said teeth being applied on said chains 
and being mutually spaced along the extension of said 

chains. 
Machine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said pressure means comprise 

shoes that laterally face, on opposite sides, the lateral 
surface of said cop or support, said shoes being movable by 

control means towards or away from said cop or support, and 
individually form a lateral support, arranged opposite to 

said cop or support, for said chains that bear said teeth. 
Machine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the side of said shoes that is 

directed towards said cop or support and engages said chains 
has at least one central portion that is substantially 

parallel to the directrices of the lateral surface of said 
cop or support which face said shoes. 
Machine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that each one of said shoes has, 

upstream of said central portion along the advancement 
direction of the portion of said chains that faces said cop 

or support, an initial segment that gradually moves closer 
to said cop or support, the initial part of said central 

portion being spaced from an axial end of said cop or 
support, so that said teeth engage the residual thread to be 

removed starting from a region which is spaced from the 
axial end of said cop or support that lies opposite to the 

axial end from which said residual thread is extracted. 
Machine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said shoes are oscillatable in 

the plane of arrangement of said chains. 
Machine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said shoes are oscillatable in 

the plane of arrangement of said chains against, or by 
 

virtue of the action of, elastic means. 
Machine according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said locking means comprise 

two oppositely arranged and mutually coaxial pins, at least 
one of which is axially movable by control means with 

respect to the other pin to lock or release a cop or support 
interposed coaxially between said pins.
