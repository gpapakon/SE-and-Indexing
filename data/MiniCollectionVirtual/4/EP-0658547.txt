<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel N-pyrazolyl
carbamate derivative and an agricultural/horticultural
fungicide containing the same as an active ingredient.It has hitherto been known that a certain N-pyrazolyl
carbamate derivative has a biological activity such as
herbicidal effect. For example, in EP129830, there is
described a compound of the formula:

   as a compound having a herbicidal activity.In DE3423582, there is also described a compound of
the formula: 

wherein R is a cyano group or an alkoxycarbonyl group: R1 is an alkyl
group or an aryl group; R2 is a hydrogen atom or a group of -C(X)YR1; and X
and Y indicate an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom, as a compound having a
herbicidal activity.EP-A-571 326 describes pyrazolyl acetic acid derivatives and their use for
the control of phytopathogens.EP-A-483 851 discloses pyrazolyl acrylic acid derivatives and agricultural/horticultural
fungicides containing said derivatives.JP-A-5-201 980 discloses methoxyiminoacetic acid derivatives and agricultural/horticultural
bactericides containing said derivatives.However, these compounds are not necessarily suitable as an agricultural/horticultural
fungicide at present.The present inventors have intensively studied about the N-pyrazolyl carbamate
derivative. As a result, it has been found that a N-pyrazolyl carbamate
derivative having a certain structure has not only excellent fungicidal
activity but also extremely excellent systemicity in plants. The present
invention is based on such finding.Thus, one object of the present invent ion is to provide a N-pyrazolyl carbamate
derivative which has an excellent fungicidal activity.Another object of the present invention is to provide an agricultural/horticultural
fungicide containing the N-pyrazolyl carbamate derivative as an 
active ingredient, which has excellent preventive effects on various phytopathogenic
fungi.These objects as well as other objects and advantages of the present invention
will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description.The present invention provides a N-pyrazolyl carbamate derivative represented
by the general formula (I):

wherein R1 and R2 independently indicate a hydrogen atom or a C1-C4 alkyl
group; R3 is a hydrogen atom, a C1-C4 alkyl group, a C2-C5 alkynyl
group, a C2-C4 alkylthioalkyl group or a C2-C4 alkoxyalkyl group; A is -O-,
-C(O)-, -OCH2-, -CH2O-, -CH2S-, -C≡C-, -CH=CH-, -CH2CH2-,
-CH2ON=C(R4)-, or -CH=NOC(R4)(R5)- (wherein R4 and R5 independently
indicate a hydrogen atom or a C1-C4 alkyl
