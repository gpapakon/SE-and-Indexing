<ABSTRACT>
A wire tensioner incorporates a hysteresis brake (1) 
to apply tension to the wire. The residual torque or 

cogging effect which is caused when current is switched 
off when the brake rotor is stationary is reduced or 

eliminated by applying a decaying alternating current to 
the stator coil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tensioner, and in 
particular to a wire tensioner using a hysteresis brake. In tensioners using a hysteresis brake, the wire is 
fed around a pulley wheel mounted on the permanent 
magnet alloy cup or ring which rotates in an annular 
space between circumferentially spaced soft iron poles. 
A direct current magnetises the poles, and this applies 
a drag to the rotating cup, thus tensioning the wire. 
The drag applied is governed by the current. Hysteresis brakes have many advantages. For 
example, torque is proportional to current and a smooth 
response is obtained, and short and long term torque 
stability are good However, the phenomenon of residual torque, known as 
cogging, presents a major disadvantage when hysteresis 
brakes are used to tension fine wire. Cogging occurs 
when the current is removed from the poles while the 
rotor is stationary. This phenomenon has been discussed 
in "Hysteresis Devices Give Precise Control of Tension 
and Torque", by A.D. Jones, Power Drives, October 1973. 
If there is residual torque in the brake, this may 
greatly exceed the maximum desired torque for fine wire, 
with the result that the wire will break as it is pulled  
 
through the tensioner on starting up. The present invention aims to overcome the problem 
of cogging in hysteresis brakes, and to provide a 
tensioner suitable for fine wire. The invention provides a tensioner comprising a 
hysteresis brake, and means for applying a decaying 
alternating current to the brake. It has been found that by applying a decaying 
alternating current to the brake, the phenomenon of 
cogging can be alleviated. In particular, whenever the brake stops rotating 
while a current is applied to the brake, for example due 
to a wire break, a decaying alternating current is 
applied. We have termed this feature of avoiding cogging in a 
hysteresis brake the "SOFT-MODE" effect. The invention will be further described by way of 
example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in 
which: 
Figure 1 shows schematically a control circuit for a 
hysteresis brake used in a tensioner according to the 
invention, Figures 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d show waveforms for the 
normal operation of the hysteresis brake, Figure 3 shows a waveform for avoiding cogging, in 
accordance with the invention, and Figure 4 shows a circuit diagram for the control 
circuit of Figure 1. Referring to Figure 1 or Figure 4, a control voltage 
Vc is applied to control the hysteresis brake 1 via a 
comparator 2 and an H-bridge
