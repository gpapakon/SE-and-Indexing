<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to FM communication 
equipment and broadcasting equipment having digital 
frequency-modulating circuits, and particularly to an FM 
stereo broadcasting apparatus which digitally processes 
signals and which has features of stabilized operating 
characteristics, small size and low power consumption. The frequency modulation (FM) system is well 
known to assure high transmission quality as compared 
with the amplitude modulation (AM) system, and thus it 
is widely used for stereo sound broadcasting, communications 
through radio and satellite links and so on. This frequency modulation is to modulate the 
instantaneous frequency of a carrier signal by the 
instantaneous amplitude of a modulation signal such as 
an audio signal. If the carrier signal and the 
modulation signal are respectively represented by y(t) = 
cos(ωct + (t)) = cos(Φ(t)) and x(t), the instantaneous 
frequency can be expressed by the following equation. 
dΦ(t)/dt = ωc + p·x(t) ωc: the angular frequency of the carrier p: the peak frequency deviation Integrating the equation (1) will yield the 
instantaneous phase of the carrier as given by 
Φ(t) = ωct + ₀ + p·∫x(t)dt Thus, the frequency-modulated signal can be expressed by 
the following equation (3). 
y(t) = cos(ωct + ₀ + p·∫x(t)dt) ₀: the initial phase The frequency modulation, which has so far 
been performed by analog circuits, can be now carried 
out by digital circuits since the digital signal 
processing technique and IC technology have recently 
developed to higher stages. When the digital circuit technology is used 
for the frequency modulation, the equation (3) is 
expressed in a discrete form as shown by the following 
equation (4). 
yn = cos(nωcT + ₀ + p·Σxn) yn, xn  : sampled output and input signal 
sequence values T: sampling period The equation (4) can be expressed by circuit 
elements as shown in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 1, there 
are shown a coefficient multiplier 51, a DDS (Direct 
Digital Synthesizer) circuit 56, adders 52, 53, a delay 
element 54 and a memory ROM (read only memory) 55 which 
has a cosine function value stored therein. The operation of this circuit arrangement will 
be described. An input signal xn is fed to the 
coefficient multiplier 51 where it is multiplied by a 
coefficient (peak frequency deviation) p. The output 
from the multiplier 51 is supplied to the DDS circuit  
 
56. In the DDS circuit 56, the adder 52 adds the input 
signal from the coefficient multiplier 51 to the 
carrier's angular frequency ωc multiplied
