<DESCRIPTION>
 CLEANING COMPOSITIONFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to shear thickening compositions in the form of liquids, sprays, gels and pastes, which remove dried-on and cooked-on food and other difficult-to-remove soils from kitchen utensils, flatware, dishes, glassware, cookware, bakeware, cooking surfaces, and surrounding areas in a convenient, easy, timely, and mild manner.Of the difficult-to-remove soils, the most severe is the baked and/or burned-on (especially when reheated and/or allowed to build up over time). Soil categories include grease, meat (including skin), dairy, fruit pie filling, carbohydrate, and starch. Soiled substrate categories include aluminum, iron, stainless steel, enamel, Corningware, Pyrex, and other glass cookware.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONCurrent light duty liquid detergents are dramatically deficient in these areas.The consumer has to soak soiled items for long periods of time in these solutions, and then use harsh cleaning methods (scouring with steel wool or scouring cleanser) to remove the remaining soil.To speed up the process and increase efficacy of cleaning these soils, the consumer will resort to heat, scraping, and harsh chemicals (e.g. caustic oven cleaners). Deficiencies in these cleaning methods include time consumption for soaking and scouring, physical effort required for scouring and scraping, irritation to hands from harsh cleaning chemicals and methods, damage to objects from harsh chemicals and methods, unpleasant fumes and odors, and danger from heated solutions. 

Though non-caustic cleaners are listed in the literature, none are directed to the cleaning compositions of the present invention.United States patent 4,575,530 (March 11 , 1986) describes hydrocarbon solution additives which are polyampholytes which incorporates cationic and anionic moieties on the same polymeric backbone. These hydrocarbon solutions have shear thickening properties.U.S. patent 4,536,539 (August 20, 1985) claims include increasing the viscosity of water under increasing shear rates (22.0 - approaching 100 sec-1 ). This shear thickening behavior is primarily attributed to the increase in apparent molecular weight of the interpolymer complex through formation of intermolecular ionic linkages. Our patent teaches that these thickened silicates show shear thickening (dilatency), an increase in viscosity as shear rate is increased. Furthermore, the viscosity values at each shear rate are independent of the timescale of the experiment. Once the shear rate is applied, the
