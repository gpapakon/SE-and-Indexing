<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pyrimidine 
and pyridine derivatives or pharmacologically acceptable 
salts thereof, which have an excellent inhibitory effect 
on acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT). The compounds of the present invention have 
the effect of reducing serum cholesterol by inhibiting 
the absorption of cholesterol from intestinal tract and 
suppress the accumulation of cholesterol esters in the 
arterial wall. Therefore, they are useful as a prophylactic 
and therapeutic agent for hypercholesterolemia, 
atherosclerosis and various diseases caused by them (for 
example, ischemic heart diseases such as myocardial 
infarction, and cerebrovascular diseases such as 
cerebral infarction and cerebral apoplexy). Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 
61-40272 and 1-207234 disclose compounds (e.g. 5-[3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)ureido]-6-methyl-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-2-phenylpyrimidine) and 3-[3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-ureido]-4-(3-nitrophenyl)-2-methyl-6-phenylpyridine, 
respectively, as pharmaceutical compositions for curing 
cerebrovascular diseases. Japanese Patent Unexamined  
 
Publication No. 5-320028 discloses compounds such as 4-(phenylureido)pyridine 
and 4-(phenylureido)pyrimidine as 
hair tonics. But, these references do not describe the 
above compounds as having ACAT-inhibitory activity or 
serum-cholesterol-lowering activity, at all. Japanese 
Patent Unexamined Publication Nos. 62-258366, 63-253060, 
2-258756 and 5-92950 disclose pyrimidine and pyridine 
derivatives having ACAT-inhibitory effect, but the 
effect of all the pyrimidine and pyridine derivatives 
are not sufficient. The present invention provides novel 
pyrimidine and pyridine derivatives or pharmacologically 
acceptable salts thereof, a process for production of 
the derivatives, and ACAT inhibitors containing the 
derivative or the salt as an active ingredient. The present inventors found that novel 
compounds not known in any literature, N-phenyl-N'-(4-phenylpyrimidin-5-yl)urea 
and N-phenyl-N'-(4-phenylpyridin-5-yl)urea 
derivatives represented by the general 
formula (I): 
[wherein R¹ is a lower alkyl group, a lower cycloalkyl 
group, a lower alkoxy group, an aliphatic cyclic amino 
group which may be substituted by one or more lower 
alkyl groups, or a phenyl group which may be substituted 
by one or more halogen atoms, R² is a hydrogen atom or a 
lower alkyl group, R³ and R⁴, which may be the same or 
different, are hydrogen atoms, halogen atoms, lower 
alkyl groups, lower haloalkyl groups, lower alkoxy
