<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of a polyurethane lens.It is disclosed in JP-A-63-130614 that, in the production of a polyurethane lens by reacting a polyisocyanate compound with a polythiol compound, a tetrafunctional polythiol compound such as pentaerythritol tetrakis(mercaptoacetate) or pentaerythritol tetrakis(mercaptopropionate) is used in combination with a difunctional polythiol compound having two thiol groups, for example, for increasing the crosslinking degree. It is also known that the reaction rate of one polythiol compound with a polyisocyanate compound differs from that of another. As a method of producing a polyurethane lens free of an optical strain from these two or more polythiol compounds, generally, there is employed a polymerization method in which the polymerization conditions are suited to the polythiol compound having a higher reaction rate with the polyisocyanate compound, the initial polymerization temperature is set at a low temperature and the polymerization temperature is gradually increased during the polymerization reaction.However, in such a polymerization method, there is a problem in that the polymerization takes a long period of time which makes the production efficiency poor. Further, when a lens having a large central thickness and a large marginal thickness is produced, for example, from pentaerythritol tetrakis(mercaptoacetate) (to be referred to as PETMA hereinafter) which has a high reaction rate with the polyisocyanate compound, there is a relatively high amount of PETMA, and the reaction heat generated by the reaction with a polyisocyanate compound is also high. It is hence difficult to prevent the occurrence of optical strains and striae by controlling the polymerization heat alone. There is therefore a disadvantage in that the yield of lenses per a polymerization furnace is limited in mass production.The present invention has been made to overcome the above problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the production of a polyurethane lens, which serves to decrease the polymerization time for producing a polyurethane lens from a polyisocyanate compound and polythiol compounds and which permits the production of a lens free of optical strain and striae with good producibility in producing plastic lens having a large central thickness and a large marginal thickness, which can be used in optical instruments or devices.The above object and advantages of the present invention is achieved by a process for
