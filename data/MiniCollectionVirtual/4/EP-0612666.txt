Container stackable after rotation having a 
cross-section tapering downwardly, characterized in that 

at least one side wall has a plurality of steps, wherein 
at least two steps are formed in the side wall by means 

of which the cross-section of the container stackable 
after rotation tapers from the upward to the downward 

direction. 
Container stackable after rotation according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the wall sections (20) located 

between the steps (21) of the side wall are vertical. 
Container stackable after rotation according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the wall sections (20) located 

between the steps (21) of the side walls are at an angle 
with respect to the vertical. 
Container stackable after rotation according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the front 

surfaces of the steps (21) exhibit an angle of 45° with 
respect to the vertical. 
Container stackable after rotation according to one of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the surfaces 

which are designed for supporting the upper container 
are arranged in impressions in a container head piece 

(47) at at least one of the upper container edge (47) 
locations at which the floor (55) of the next higher 

stacked container seats and, in at least one of these 
impressions (43), a vertical protrusion (44) is arranged 

for engagement with the floor of the upper container and  
 

a corresponding receptacle (52) for this protrusion (44) 
is provided on the lower side of the floor rotated by 

180° about the vertical middle axis. 
Container stackable after rotation according to claim 5 
characterized in that the head piece (47) exhibits 

outwardly projecting flanges (32, 33) on its upper end 
having impressions (43). 
Containers stackable after rotation according to claim 5 
or 6 characterized in that a straight flange (49) is 

provided for below the outer edge of the flanges (32, 
33). 
Container stackable after rotation according to one of 
the preceding claims characterized in that vertical 

protrusions (44) and impressions (43) for receiving 
dents are provided for at a separation from the outer 

edge of the flanges (32, 33). 
Container stackable after rotation according to one of 
the preceding claims characterized in that its upper 

edge is configured as a head piece (65) having vertical 
outer walls (64) and the surfaces of these outer 

walls (64) are configured, at least sectionwise in 
regions at which closely stacked containers (72, 72') 

are mutually adjacent, such that the frictional 
resistance is increased compared to that of a smooth 

surface.  
 
Container stackable after rotation according to claim 9, 
characterized in that the surfaces of adjacent 

components are roughened. 
Container stackable after rotation according to claim 9, 
characterized in that protrusions (67, 68) are provided 

for in mutually adjacent surfaces which interlock. 
Container stackable after rotation according to claim 11 
characterized in that openings are provided for in 

mutually adjacent surfaces into which the protrusions 
engage. 
Container stackable after rotation according to one of 
the claims 9 to 12, characterized in that the 

components (67) mutually engaging each other exhibit 
toothed racks and strips (68) running perpendicular 

thereto.
