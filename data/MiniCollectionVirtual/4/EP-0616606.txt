<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of dense polycrystalline silicon carbide shaped
articles and the superior shaped articles produced by the
process. In one aspect the invention provides a new firing
cycle for the production of dense polycrystalline silicon
carbide shaped articles. In accordance with this firing
cycle, powder compacts containing silicon carbide and
alumina or a precursor thereof are first heated to an
intermediate temperature, as will be explained in more
detail below. After an extended dwell at the intermediate
temperature, the temperature is raised in a second stage to
a higher temperature to complete the densification process.In the second stage, magnesia or a precursor
thereof may optionally be present as a sintering assist,
and the atmosphere is essentially carbon monoxide. It is
preferred that the original compact contains magnesia, or a
precursor thereof, but the magnesia may be introduced
during the firing cycle. Depending upon the particular
conditions, it may also be advantageous to have a
controlled amount of carbon present, as will be explained
in more detail below. In a preferred embodiment of the
invention, the first stage is carried out in an inert
atmosphere such as argon, and the atmosphere is changed
after the intermediate temperature dwell, for example by
purging the furnace chamber and introducing carbon monoxide
for the remainder of the firing cycle.Shaped articles comprising high density
polycrystalline silicon carbide are well known. They are
characterised by excellent physical properties such as high
resistance to thermal shock, abrasion and oxidation
together with high levels of strength and thermal 
conductivity. It is this combination of properties which
makes silicon carbide materials leading candidates for
engineering applications. However, the production of
satisfactory high density materials has been fraught with
difficulties.Early workers (eg Alliegro, Coffin and Tinkepaugh
J. Amer. Ceram. Soc., 39 [11] 386-89 [1956]) showed that
silicon carbide could be hot pressed to high density bodies
with the aid of sintering aids such as aluminium and iron,
and aluminium plus one of the metals zirconium, boron or
iron. It was further disclosed that for the hot pressing
of silicon carbide, magnesium additions and magnesium and
aluminium additions were ineffective, and impaired the
densification process as compared to a control sample of
silicon carbide, hot pressed under identical conditions
with no additives or additions. Lange (J. Mater.

A process for the production of dense
polycrystalline silicon carbide shaped articles,

characterized in that the process includes the following
steps :


(a) heating a powder compact containing silicon

essentially consisting of carbon monoxide, the
hold temperature being maintained for a time

sufficient to remove silica and other species
unstable at the sintering temperature from the

compact, and

above 1900°C in an atmosphere essentially

consisting of carbon monoxide for sufficient
time to produce a dense polycrystalline silicon

product.

is an unstable species removed in step (b).
Process according to claim 1 wherein the
hold temperature is maintained at between 1400 and 1650°C

in an inert atmosphere.
