<ABSTRACT>
Articulation used in motor vehicle seats including a fixed flange (1) with internal toothing (3) intended to interact either with a twin planet gear (5) whose toothings (4 and 6) mesh, on the one hand, with the toothing (3) of the fixed flange (1) and, on the other hand, with the internal toothing (7) of a moving flange (8), or directly with the internal toothing of the moving flange, an eccentric acting either on the planet gear or directly on the moving flange and a driveshaft of the eccentric equipped with at least one lug (21a), the eccentric consisting of two discs (18, 19) which can move angularly relative to each other and are joined together by an elastic element (30) housed in two arched openings (23, 24) whereas the central part of these discs (18, 19) is pierced, in the case of each of them, with at least one circular hole (18a, 19a) extended by a hollow housing (18b, 19b) intended to receive the lug (21a) of the driveshaft, characterised in that each disc is non-circular and housed in a bore (5a) of the planet gear or of the moving flange, the two discs in a position separated from each other then taking up play and making the articulation irreversible.

Articulation used in motor vehicle seats, including
a fixed flange (1) having an inner toothing (3) for

cooperating either with a double satellite (5), the
toothings (4 and 6) of which mesh on one side with the

toothing (3) of the fixed flange (1) and on the other
side with the inner toothing (7) of a mobile flange (8),

or directly with the inner toothing of the mobile

flange, an eccentric acting either on the satellite or
directly on the mobile flange, and a driving axis of the

eccentric provided with at least one snug (21a), the
eccentric being made of two discs (18, 19) angularly

mobile with respect to one another and connected to one
another by a resilient element (30) housed in two arched

windows (23, 24), while each of the central portion of
these discs (18, 19) is formed with at least one

circular recess (18a, 19a), extended by a hollow housing
(18b, 19b) adapted for receiving the snug (21a) of the

driving axis, characterized in that each disc has an
un-circular shape such, as when they are angularly

spaced apart, they constitute together a quasi-circle
that accupies practically all the central bore of the

satellite, each disc being housed inside a bore (5a) of
the satellite or of the mobile flange, the two discs,

when in a position spaced apart from one another,
ensuring the clearance take-up and also the

irreversibility of the articulation.
Articulation according to claim 1, characterized in
that the two hollow housings (18b, 19b) of the discs are

angularly offset when the two discs are in a position
where they are spaced apart from one another, in order

that the snug acts first on one disc for unblocking the
eccentric, then on the two simultanenously. 
Articulation according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that each arched window includes, at

one end, a recess (23a, 24a) providing to the spring a
bearing on a single arched opening.
Articulation according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the connection between the fixed

flange (1) and the mobile flange (8) is made via a
crimped ring (15) with interposition, between this ring

(15) and the mobile flange (8), of a crown (13) made of
balls (14).
Articulation according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the discs (18, 19) are formed with

holes (25, 26, 27, 28) diametrically opposite for each
disc (18, 19) and angularly offset by pairs, due to the

offsetting of these discs (18, 19) when the resilient
element (30) is compressed, the holes (25, 26, 27, 28)

allowing for the mounting of the control cam provided by
the two discs (18, 19) with the assistance of any

suitable members when the resilient element is
over-compressed.
Articulation according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the discs are glued onto one

another in the mounting position.
Articulation according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that one of the discs (18) includes two

semi-cut portions (180) engaged inside holes (190) in
the other disc (19).
Articulation according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the two discs bear on a bearing

rigidly connected to one of the flanges.
