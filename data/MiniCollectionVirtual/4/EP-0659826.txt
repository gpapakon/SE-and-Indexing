<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to resin compositions 
having excellent practical physical properties and 
antistatic properties. Generally speaking, general-purpose resins such as 
styrene resins and acrylic resins have excellent 
electrical insulating properties. Because of this 
characteristic feature, they are being commonly used in 
electric and electronic parts. On the other hand, since they have a well-balanced 
combination of mechanical strength, thermal resistance 
and moldability, they are also used widely in fields of 
application not necessarily requiring electrical 
insulating properties. In such fields of application 
not requiring electrical insulating properties, 
however, their good electrical insulating properties 
conversely constitute a shortcoming in that they are 
easily charged by friction, contact or the like to  
 
attract dust, thus detracting from their appearance 
and/or causing electrostatic destruction of ICs or the 
like. Moreover, with the recent densification of 
magnetic recording media, the so-called dropout 
phenomenon has come to occur frequently as a result of 
dust attraction caused by electric charging of the 
recording medium housing. This poses a serious problem 
in the related fields of application. In order to solve the above-described problems, it 
has been conventional practice to reduce the surface 
resistivities of such general-purpose resins by 
incorporating thereinto an antistatic agent that is a 
low-molecular-weight surface-active agent or by 
applying an antistatic agent to the surfaces of molded 
articles thereof. When an antistatic agent is incorporated into 
styrene resins and acrylic resins, its antistatic 
effect generally continues as long as the antistatic 
agent is present in the resin surface. However, once 
the antistatic agent is removed by washing the resin 
surface with water or wiping it with cloth or the like, 
the antistatic capability is markedly reduced because 
it is difficult for the antistatic agent present within 
the resin to exude to the surface. Moreover, in order 
to achieve the desired antistatic capability, a 
relatively large amount of antistatic agent needs to be  
 
incorporated or applied. This makes the surfaces of 
molded articles sticky. In order to solve these problems, a resin 
composition comprising a styrene resin containing a 
polyethylene oxide having a specific molecular weight 
and a sulfonic acid salt having a specific structure 
has been proposed (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 
233743/'90) and put to practical use.
