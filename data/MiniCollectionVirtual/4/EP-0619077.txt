<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for covering a 
food product by arranging around the food product by means 

of extrusion a collagen-containing mass which contains a 
maximum of 92% water. 
The collagen-containing mass is preferably a paste 
of collagen treated with acid. 
The collagen-containing mass e.g. consists of 
pieces of animal collagen-containing tissue, such as animal 

dermis. 
The invention further relates to a device for 

performing the method, comprising means for supplying the 
food product, means for placing the collagen-containing mass 

under a pressure of at least 10 bar and means for shaping 
the collagen-containing mass.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
device for covering a food product. In order to prevent spoiling and dehydration 
particular foodstuffs such as sausage and the like are 
covered with a thin casing. In the past natural intestine was used as casing. 
Used nowadays however is synthetic casing which is filled 
with meat paste. A method for manufacturing synthetic casing 
is for instance described in the German patent specification 
650.526. Alternatively, it is possible to extrude the meat 
paste and simultaneously to arrange a skin of a thin collagen 
paste therearound by means of extrusion. The thus 
formed sausage is immediately carried through a brining bath 
for strengthening and later treated with a primary aldehyde, 
for instance in the form of fluid smoke, to cross link the 
collagen fibres in the skin. In this manner a strong casing 
is obtained. It is important that the collagen skin has a 
uniform appearance without bulges or holes. The paste is 
therefore guided immediately prior to extrusion through a 
gap-like opening between two conical cylinders rotating in 
opposing directions. Irregularities in the paste are hereby 
as it were ironed out and the uniformity of the casing 
ensured. The skin must moreover be very plastic to prevent 
deformation of the soft meat paste. The collagen paste consists of collagen treated 
with acid and has a water content of about 96%. A drawback 
to this comparatively large amount of water is that the 
paste takes up a lot of space during transport and is 
susceptible to spoiling. In addition a relatively large 
number of finishing treatments are necessary to harden the 
skin. The object of the present invention is to provide 
a method and device for covering food products wherein the 
said drawbacks are obviated.  This is achieved by the invention by arranging 
round the food product by means of extrusion a collagen-containing 
mass which contains a maximum of 92% water. From the German patent specification 659.490 it is 
known to manufacture a synthetic casing of skin components 
by means of a circular nozzle. During extrusion air is blown 
in the thus formed hose to dry and cure the casing. The 
water content of the fiber paste used in this process is at 
least 75%. Contrary to the present invention this casing 
produced is formed separately from the food product and is 
filled with meat paste later on. In this sequence of steps 
the fibre paste has to comply only to the requirements of 
the casing itself. In the process of the invention however
