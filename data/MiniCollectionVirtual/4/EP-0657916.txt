<ABSTRACT>
In primary portions of an electron beam direct 
writing system and an electron beam direct writing method, an 

aperture member (16) includes a shot aperture (161) 
corresponding to a first, a second and a third shot pattern 

(91a, 91b, 91d) horizontally and vertically adjacent to each 
other on a semiconductor substrate (18) and an evaluation 

aperture (15) corresponding to evaluation patterns (92) 
formed by mapping a first line/interval pattern (21a, 22a) in 

peripheral portions of the first shot pattern (91a) and 
second line/interval patterns (21b, 22d) in peripheral 

portions of the second and the third shot pattern (91b, 91d). 
The first line/interval pattern (21a, 22a) is formed by 

arranging short lines (212, 222) in horizontal and vertical 
directions at first pitches (s) and the second line/interval 

patterns (21b, 22d) are created by mapping short lines at 
second pitches (p) slightly different from the first pitches 

(s). The first line/interval pattern (21a, 22a) and the 
second line/interval patterns (21b, 22d) on the semiconductor 

substrate (18) have a main/auxiliary scale relationship 
established therebetween. Consequently, quantities of 

rotation and gain of a shot are determined according to real 
dimensions in a short period of time, leading to improvement 

of the system throughput. Since the evaluation patterns (92) 
are directly created in the periphery of an LSI chip, it is 

unnecessary to prepare a sample and no abutments of resist 
film need a direct measurement, eliminating a cause of 

dimensional error.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron beam
direct writing system and an electron beam direct writing
method for the same, and in particular, to an electron beam
direct writing system as an electron beam exposure system for
use in lithography for ULSI's (ultra large-scale integrated
circuits), permitting facilitated rotation and gain
corrections of shot patterns, and to an electron beam direct
writing method for the same.The electron beam direct writing system has been and
is indispensable in the art of lithography for fabricating
ULSI's that are as large in scale as several millions or more
in number of patterns and need enhanced levels of integration
and precision techniques. The lithography is a process for
giving a desired pattern to a semiconductor substrate.For the lithography, the electron beam direct writing
system is generally adapted to project a high-speed electron
beam within an erergy range of 5 KeV to 100 KeV, scanning over
a resist film coated on a mask substrate or wafer, so that
chemical reactions in the irradiated portions of the resist
film can be utilized to obtain a desired pattern on the mask
substrate or wafer. The electron beam is converged into a
diameter of or a square with a side of 0.1 micrometer (µm)
or less, permitting a high resolution. Moreover, the beam 
can be arbitrarily deflected through an electric and a
magnetic field. A voluntary pattern is thus obtainable with
a high precision, by controlling a beam deflecting scan signal
from a computer.The electron beam is categorized by the sectional
form into a Gaussian beam and a shaped beam. The latter is
shaped into a desired form through apertures of a
corresponding sectional form, and is converged to have a
homothetically reduced figure when irradiated for a mapping.
In applications to electron beam direct writing systems for
the lithography for ULSI's, it appears as a variable shaped
beam having a varible sectional form defined through a pair of
electro-optically superimposed appertures.The variable shaped beam is inherently suitable for
both high speed and high precision processes, thus
contributing to the great demand for electron beam direct
writing systems of a type having employed that beam for the
lithography of ULSI's.Fig. 1 shows a conventional electron beam direct
writing system of such the type. The conventional system is
constituted with an electron gun 111 for projecting an
electron beam 113, a first and a second aperture member 112
and 116 vertically spaced apart from each other and arranged
for
