<ABSTRACT>
An enteral fluid delivery system (1) is disclosed having a fluid container (2) with a pierceable seal (10) covering an opening to the container (2). A connection component (6) connects an administration set (4) to the fluid container (2). The connection component (6) includes a hollow tube (48, 132) that is connected to the administration set (4) at one end and has a spike (50, 130) at the other end. During storage and transportation, spike (50, 130) is aligned with and positioned slightly away from the seal (10). In use, spike (50, 130) is linearly movable to pierce the seal (10) thereby communicating the fluid in the container (2) through the tube (48, 132) to the administration set (4). Spike (50, 130) is prevented from inadvertently moving to pierce the seal (10) by retaining means. The retaining means may be selectively disengaged thereby allowing the spike (50, 130) to move to pierce the seal (10). In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the fluid container (2) and the administration set (4) are provided together in a set with the container (2) prefilled with fluid and the connection component (6) connecting the container (2) and the administration set (4) with the spike (50, 130) retained in position aligned with and positioned slightly away from seal (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUID CONTAINER AND CONNECTION COMPONENTTECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to fluid containers and connection components for connecting the fluid containers to a fluid delivery system and more particularly relates to fluid containers and connection components for connecting fluid containers containing enteral feeding fluids to an enteral feeding fluid administration set.BACKGROUND ART Enteral feeding systems typically include a container of enteral feeding fluid, an enteral feeding tube for delivering the enteral feeding fluid to a patient's intestinal system and a connection component system for connecting the enteral feeding tube to the fluid container. The connection component system typically includes an administration set including tubing connecting the fluid container to the enteral feeding tube. The administration set is connected to the fluid container through a connection component and is connected to the enteral feeding tube through a port mounted on the feeding tube. Typically, the enteral feeding tube remains in place within the patient for several days at a time while the enteral fluid container and the administration set are changed every 24 hours.It has been the usual practice in enteral feeding fluid delivery systems to provide a separate enteral feeding fluid container and a separate administration set that are connected through the connection component at the time the fluid container and the administration set are changed. This procedure has several problems. First, there is the danger of cross contamination of the feeding fluid by the clinician. Because the fluid container and the administration set are separate, they must be connected through the connection component. While connecting the fluid container to the administration set, the surfaces on 

the connection component are susceptible to being touched, and thereby contaminated, by the clinician. Then as the connection component connects the fluid container to the administration set, the contaminated surfaces of the connection component are placed in contact with the enteral fluid thereby contaminating the fluid.Second, when changing the empty fluid container, remnants of the fluid within the container leak from the container. This leaked fluid produces objectionable consequences affecting cleanliness and health.Further, having separate fluid containers and administration sets requires separate packaging, storage and inventories for each. These problems described above are preferably to be avoided. An example of a typical
