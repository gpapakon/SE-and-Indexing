<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a construction for 
milking animals, such as cows, comprising a milking box, one 
or more milking robots and a control room. Such a construction is known from EP-PA-0 270 165. A problem with the above mentioned construction is 
that the control room is at a relative large distance from 
the milking box, while the farmer is only able to observe the 
milking process from behind a transparent wall. An object of the present invention is to provide 
the construction for milking animals with a control room from 
which the farmer is not only able to observe the milking 
process but is also able to intervene. To that end the construction for milking animals 
is characterized in that the control room is located aside of 
a milking box in such a manner that the side of the milking 
box constitutes a wall of the control room. This offers a supervisor not only a good view of 
the milking construction but it makes it also possible to 
carry out maintenance to the milking robot from or in the 
control room. In accordance with a further feature of the 
invention, the side of the milking box has a height of 
approximately 2.1 metres. In accordance with still another feature of the 
invention the control room is provided with a floor which 
slopes down towards a dung cellar. As in general a cow shed  
 
with animals is dusty and dirty, it is of advantage to have a 
control room which is easy to clean. The invention further has for its object to 
improve a construction as mentioned in the preamble. To that 
end, the construction is characterized in that it comprises a 
cubicle shed having at least two rows of resting boxes, which 
are arranged at least for the main part at one side of the 
shed and wherein at least one milking robot is positioned at 
the end of a row of resting boxes. As a result thereof, the 
construction in accordance with the invention has the 
advantage that the animals can easily enter the milking box 
from the resting area. In accordance with a further feature of the invention, 
the exit of a milking box gives acess to an adjoining 
feeding area, in which measures have been taken to ensure 
that there is always a sufficient quantity of fodder therein. 
Since the exit of the milking box is contiguous to a feeding 
area, the animal, after the end of the automatic milking 
procedure in the milking box, will leave same comparatively 
rapidly in order to go and feed in the feeding area, whilst 
the animal will not easily be inclined to lie down, after 
having been milked, on the
