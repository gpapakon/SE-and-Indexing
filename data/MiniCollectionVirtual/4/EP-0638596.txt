<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a fluoropolymer containing a fluoroolefin unit as the principal constitutional unit, 
which comprises employi
ng CF₃(CF₂)
n
CH₂CH₃ or CF₃(CF₂)
n
H (wherein n is an integer from 1 to 8) as a polymerization 
medium and CF₂ClCF₂CHClF and/or CF₃CF₂CHCl₂ as a chain transfer agent. The process affords a fluoropolymer 

having favorable resistances to heat, solvents, chemicals, etc., by the use of a polymerization medium which is less apt 
to cause environmental destruction. The chain transfer agent has good compatibility with the polymerization medium 

which is less apt to cause environmental destruction and thus can effectively produce a fluoropolymer having favorable 
resistances to heat, solvents, etc. Moreover, it has high affinities for both the objective polymer and the polymerization 

medium, and can easily be handled in the post-treatment step such as granulation and drying.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
producing a fluorinated polymer, particular to a method
for efficiently producing a fluorine-type polymer
excellent in the heat resistance, solvent resistance,
chemical resistance, etc. by means of a polymerization
medium which is less likely to bring about an
environmental destruction.In recent years, fluorinated polymers have been used
for various applications utilizing their characteristics,
since they are polymer materials excellent in the heat
resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance, etc.As a method for producing fluorinated polymers, a
solution polymerization method, a suspension
polymerization method or an elusion polymerization method
is known. As a polymerization medium for the solution
polymerization method or the suspension polymerization
method, an inert solvent such as a chlorofluorocarbon is
usually employed from the viewpoint of the polymerization
speed or for a reason that it presents a copolymer of
high molecular weight. Specific examples of such a
chlorofluorocarbon include trichlorofluoromethane,
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorotrifluoromethane and 
dichlorotetrafluoroethane. From the viewpoint of the
handling efficiency, trichlorotrifluoroethane is mainly
used.Whereas, in recent years, destruction of the ozone
layer has been taken up internationally as a problem of
environmental destruction of global scale, and as a
responsible substance, the chlorofluorocarbon has been
pointed out, and there is worldwide trend for total
abolition of its use. Therefore, it is now necessary to
stop using the chlorofluorocarbon which has been used at
the time of producing fluorinated polymer.As a substitute for such a chlorofluorocarbon, a
hydrofluorocarbon having fluorine atoms, has been
proposed, as it has a small ozone-destructing
coefficient (US-A-5182342). However, a substance having a C-H bond has
been known to show a chain transfer property to a
fluoroolefin, and it has been believed that it is
difficult to use a hydrochlorofluorocarbon containing
hydrogen atoms, as a polymerization medium for the
production of a fluoroolefin-type polymer of a high
molecular weight. As other substitutes for the
polymerization medium, t-butanol (Japanese Examined
Patent Publication No. 24073/1977), etc. are known, but
it is thereby necessary to conduct polymerization under a
high pressure in order to obtain a polymer having a
sufficiently high molecular weight.Further, when these substitutes are used as 
polymerization media, a commonly employed chain
