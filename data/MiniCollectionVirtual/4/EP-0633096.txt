<ABSTRACT>
A chuck (2) has movable clamping jaws (3), a spatially separate drive mechanism for moving the jaws and measurement devices for determining the clamping force and displacement. The difference in displacement for an imminent change in clamping force and the final value of the clamping movement is compared with a threshold value to derive an output signal. The piston (7) of a drive cylinder is connected to the jaws via a draw rod (6) to cause movement of he jaws. Measurement devices detect the clamping press. and the piston stroke. The difference between the piston position when the clamping press. is changed and the piston end position is determined and compared with the threshold value to produce the output signal.
