One output of the mains-side converter (1), one input of the load-side converter (2) and one terminal of the energy store (4) are interconnected. The switching unit (3) selectably powers the load (10) directly from the mains (MAINS), from the mains (MAINS) via the series circuit of the converters (1, 2) or from the energy store (4) via the load-side converter (2). A control unit (5) comprises a logic circuit (6), a measuring instrument (7) for the mains supply, a measuring instrument (9) for a load current and a device (ELT) for the input of predetermined tolerances into the logic circuit (6). The logic circuit (6) is connected to both converters (1, 2) and the switching unit (3) to control them in such a way that the power supply to the load (10) is ensured in the current prevailing conditions in the mains (MAINS).
