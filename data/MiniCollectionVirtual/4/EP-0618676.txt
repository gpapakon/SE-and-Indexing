<ABSTRACT>
A device is kept tuned by a tuning signal, 
which is supplied to a tuning input 

of a tunable circuit in the device. 
The tuning signal is supplied from a memory (14). The 

device has a operating state and a calibrating 
state. The calibrating state serves to 

determine the tuning signal and to store 
it in the memory. In the calibrating state a 

broadband signal source (16) supplies a reference 
signal to the tunable circuit. The reference 

signal passes through a bandpass filter (12) which 
provides the device with selectivity in the 

operating state. The response of the tunable 
circuit to the reference signal is monitored 

and a tuning signal is selected for which it 
is measured that the tunable circuit is tuned 

to a spectral component of the reference signal 
which is passed by the bandpass filter (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to calibration of a tunable circuit for operation
under control of a stored tuning signal.Tunable circuits are often used in devices such as radio receivers, for
example at the intermediate frequency demodulation stage. For robust and sensitive
signal reception, the tunable circuit must be tuned to, or at least be tuned close to, the
frequency of the signal to be received. Proper tuning can however not be guaranteed
merely by the manufacture of such circuits. This is because of process fluctuations
during manufacturing, and also for example due to aging and temperature effects during
use.To eliminate such effects, the tuning of the tunable circuit must be 
calibrated. An example of a tunable circuit provided with tuning means according to the
preamble is an automatic calibration system for a voltage controlled oscillator known
from US patent no 4,847,569. This publication discloses a voltage controlled oscillator
which is automatically calibrated in the calibrating state. The generator comprises a
phase locked loop (PLL). In the calibrating state the PLL is made to lock onto a
reference signal which has an accurately known frequency (obtained from a crystal
oscillator). The control signal for the oscillator in the locked state of the loop is then
stored in the storing means. In the operating state this stored tuning signal is supplied to
the oscillator and serves to pretune the oscillator.The known device has the disadvantage that it requires a reference signal
with accurately known frequency for calibration. One way of supplying such a reference
signal is to use a crystal oscillator as part of the device, but this adds to the complexity
of the device and is expensive. Another way is to use an external signal source, but this
is impractical, especially when calibration is required repeatedly.Amongst others, it is an object of the invention to provide a method and a signal receiving device
which is capable of calibration without requiring accurate additional circuitry or an
external generator for the calibration.Claims 1 and 2 define a method of calibration and a signal receiving device,
respectively, in accordance with the invention. In the invention, a bandpass filter which
is normally used in the operating state to provide
frequency selectivity for signals in the device, is also used for providing accuracy of
tuning in the calibrating state. Thus, the accuracy of the signal source is no longer
critical for calibration. Its spectrum (that is, the collection of frequencies at which
