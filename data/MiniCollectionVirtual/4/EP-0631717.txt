A mounted-type chopping apparatus with width distribution
discharge for a straw/chaff mixture for/on a combine harvester, having a

transfer hopper (5) fitted at the lower end to the housing of the straw
chopping apparatus (1) and a casting blower (6) with ejection connection

(7) characterised in that the casting blower (6) with ejection
connection (7) is arranged beneath the transfer hopper (5) and the

casting blower (6) with its ejection connection (7) is laterally
pivotable relative to the transfer hopper (5) and/or the ejection

connection (7) is laterally pivotable with respect to the casting blower
(6).
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to claim 1
characterised in that the casting blower (6) with its ejection

connection (7) can be axially reciprocally rotated relative to the

transfer hopper (5) by a control motor (8) and in that case is
adjustable in the lateral pivotal movement (pivot angle α) of its

ejection connection (7).
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to claim 1
characterised in that the ejection connection (7) is reciprocally

pivotable in stationary relationship with respect to the casting blower
(6) which is mounted under the transfer hopper (5), through an

adjustable pivot angle (α) by way of a control motor (9) and a lever
linkage (10).
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to claim 1
characterised in that fitted to the housing (4) of the straw chopping

apparatus (3) at the lower end are two transfer hoppers (5) which are
arranged at a spacing in side-by-side relationship transversely to the

direction of travel (A) of the combine harvester and beneath each of
which is mounted a respective casting blower (6) with an ejection

connection (7). 
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to claim 4
characterised in that the two casting blowers (6) are coupled together

in the reciprocal pivotal movement and are adjustable in respect of the
magnitude of the angle of pivotal movement.
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to claim 5
characterised in that arranged between the two casting blowers (6) is a

double-acting pressure fluid cylinder (11), preferably a hydraulic
cylinder, which is of an adjustable stroke magnitude.
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to claim 5
characterised in that the two casting blowers (6) are axially rotatable

by a drive (16) involving a wrap-around drive member circulating in a
loop configuration - a chain or belt drive - which is driven by a

control motor (8) and which circulates around two direction-changing
wheels (14, 15), one direction-changing wheel (15) being connected for

movement to the casting blower (6) by way of a crank bar (17), and the
two casting blowers (6) are coupled together for pivotal movement by way

of a coupling bar (18), wherein for pivotal angle adjustment of the two
casting blowers (6) the coupling bar (18) and the crank bar (17) are in

themselves adjustable in respect of length and/or variable in the
pivotal connection locations (19, 17a) to the casting blowers (6).
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to one of claims 1
to 7 characterised in that each casting blower (6) is mounted axially

rotatably on the transfer hopper (5) by means of a turntable (20).
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to one of claims 1
to 8 characterised in that the turntable (20) is formed by a C-shaped

member (21) arranged on the casting blower housing (14) and extending
therearound, and a plurality of rollers (22) which are rotatably mounted

on the hopper (5) and over which the C-shaped member (21) engages. 
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to one of claims
1 to 9 characterised in that the chopping apparatus (3) is disposed with

its axis of rotation (3a) transversely with respect to the direction of
travel (A) of the combine harvester and is connected downstream of a

straw walker (23).
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to one of claims
1 to 9 characterised in that the chopping apparatus (3) is disposed with

its axis of rotation (3a) in the direction of travel (A) of the combine
harvester and is disposed downstream of an axial separating apparatus

(24).
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to one of claims
1 to 11 characterised in that the casting blower (6) has a rotor (25)

which is rotatable coaxially with respect to the vertical hopper blower
pivot axis.
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to one of claims
1 to 12 characterised in that the casting blower (6) has a rotor (25)

which is divided by a separating plate (26) into two mutually superposed
conveyor chambers (27, 28) and to whose upper chamber (27) the chopped

straw is fed by the transfer hopper (5) and to whose lower chamber (28)
the chaff is fed from the sieve box by way of a suction intake line

(29).
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to one of claims
1 to 13 characterised in that the transfer hopper (5) with casting

blower (6) is mounted on the chopping apparatus housing (4) in such a
way as to be pivotable upwardly about a horizontal axis (33) in opposite

relationship to the direction of travel (A) of the combine harvester.
A mounted-type chopping apparatus according to claim 14
characterised in that the pivot axis (33) of the transfer hopper (5) is

disposed at the rear in the direction of travel (A) and the hopper (5) 
is held to the chopping apparatus housing (14) by means of said pivot

axis (33) and a closure means (34) in the working position.
