<ABSTRACT>
Compositions for use as sealants, adhesives and/or coatings 
containing 3,4-polyisoprene and blends of liquid 

and/or solid rubbers and/or finely divided polymer powders 
and optionally plasticizers, fillers and other conventional 

raw materials exhibit superior vibration damping 
properties compared to conventional compositions not 

containing 3.4-polyisoprene. The compositions may be 
cured similar to the conventional sealant/adhesive and/or 

coating compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compositions for adhesives
sealants and/or coatings containing 3,4-polyisoprenes.
More particularly this invention involves curable and non-curable
compositions for adhesives sealants and/or coatings
containing conventional polymeric components and in
addition 3,4-polyisoprenes. A preferred field of application
for these compositions is the vehicle industry,
especially the automotive industry.In the manufacture and assembly of automobiles, adhesives
sealants and coatings are used for a variety of different
purposes. Sealants and adhesives are selected mainly on
the base of the following properties:
strength, i.e. shear strength, peel strengthelongation, flexibilitydurabilityease of application.For coatings, especially underbody coatings, abrasion
resistance is an additional criterion. In view of reducing
the complexity of car manufacturing and thus reducing
manufacturing costs, there is a need for "multifunctional"
products, i.e. sealants, adhesives and/or coatings which 
solve additional problems in addition to their prime
function.Contemporary design of vehicles, machines and appliances
involves almost exclusively the use of thin gauge sheet
metal. Moving parts and running engines cause vibration
of these thin metal structures, which in turn create
noise. Numerous methods for noise abatement are known,
however, most of these methods require additional manufacturing
steps and/or components which have only the
function of vibration damping. A prime example of the
conventional products for vibration damping are highly
filled bitumen pads. These pads have to be extruded,
die-cut and shaped in separate steps. Prior to application
they frequently have to be heat formed to fit them to
non flat structures and then glued to the car body,
machine or appliance. Numerous attempts have been made to
replace this costly manual procedure by products which can
be easily applied by robots. Plastisol formulations
serving the dual function of underbody coating (protection
against abrasion) and acoustic damping have been described
in EP-A-358598, or DE-A-3444863. DE-A-4013318 discloses a
two layer underbody coating which performs the dual
functions of protecting against abrasion and absorbing
noise resulting from impact (stones, gravel, water).
Whereas these products/processes are quite useful for
combining the functions of underbody coating and noise
abatement, there still remains a need to combine the
function of an adhesive and/or sealant with noise reduction.
This is particularly
