<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile apparatus having a serial printer which 
performs printing head initialization for exact and 

reliable printing in mode characteristic to facsimile 
apparatuses where printing cannot be retried. For this 

purpose, in stand-by status, the printing head is held 
at a stand-by position, and upon printing, the printing 

head is moved in a main-scanning direction while a 
recording sheet is shifted in a subscanning direction. 

The facsimile apparatus comprises a detector for 
detecting the presence/absence of the printing head at 

the stand-by position, a receiver for receiving a 
printing start signal, and a controller for, when the 

printing start signal is received by the receiver, 
performing the initialization by moving the printing 

head to the stand-by position based on a detected result 
by the detector.

<DESCRIPTION>
Present invention relates to a facsimile apparatus
employing a serial printing device that reciprocates a
serial printing head in a main-scanning direction while
shifting a recording sheet in a subscanning direction.Conventionally, various facsimile apparatuses
comprising a printer of a serial printing method have
been introduced. In these facsimile apparatuses, if an
ink-jet printing head is employed as the printing head,
cleaning/recovery operation is performed at
predetermined intervals in order to avoid poor ink-discharging
by the printing head. However, the period
between the cleaning/recovery operations is very long,
e.g., once in several days.Further, these apparatuses do not perform any
preprinting function, such as preparation for printing
operation, by moving the carriage that holds the
printing head. Also, these apparatuses do not perform
functions related to moving the carriage before
printing.On the other hand, in a case where the serial
printer drives the carriage by a step motor, driving
load is the greatest when starts to drive the carriage
from a home position. This causes insufficiency of 
torque at the step motor. Especially, if time the
carriage is held is prolonged, the driving becomes
impossible.One of reasons for the driving impossibility is
non-printing status for a long period. This shifts the
position of a rotor with respect to a stator within the
step motor from an excited phase of an exciting signal
for the step motor. Normally, the latest excited phase
of the stopped step motor is maintained until the next
exciting signal is applied. When the step motor is
stopped for many hours, the exciting signal is turned
off in consideration of safety. Basically, If the
exciting signal is turned off for hours, the motor phase
may be shifted for some reason, and in this case, the
shifted phase does not correspond to the start point of
the next exciting signal. This results in
synchronization error status where the step motor cannot
operate in synchronization with the exciting signal.Another reason for a driving impossibility from a
mechanical standpoint is slight deformation and/or burr
at a guide shaft for conveyably guiding the carriage or
at a contact portion between the carriage and the guide
shaft. In this case, the carriage might be settled on
the guide shaft at a position where greater torque Is
required for driving the carriage.In a case where the printing head mounted on the 
carriage is an ink-jet head, capping operation at a
carriage stand-by position is necessary to prevent
