<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to natural human IgM antibodies, and their uses in prognosis, diagnosis, and therapy of HIV infected individuals. In a specific embodiment, the invention relates to low affinity binding natural human serum IgM antibodies. In particular, such antibodies can recognize epitopes present on human protamines, HIV Tat protein and SP80, a seminal plasma homologue of human lactoferrin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of:
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/173,705, filed
March 25, 1988 (abandoned);U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/873,917, filed
April 24, 1992 (abandoned);U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/912,026, filed
July 9, 1992; andU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/924,412, filed
July 30, 1992.The present invention relates to natural human IgM
antibodies, and their uses in prognosis, diagnosis, and therapy.
In particular, the invention relates to natural human serum IgM
antibodies which can recognize epitopes present on
HIV Tat protein,
and which, in accord with historic
characterization of natural antibodies, exhibit low binding
affinity to antigen. This low affinity antibody subset of serum
IgM antibodies may be assayed for prognosis or diagnosis and
administered for treatment of AIDS. Methods for the detection
and/or measurement, isolation and use of the low affinity natural
human serum IgM antibodies are provided.The natural antibody repertoire is a segment of the
immune system that is little understood, was early postulated to 
provide a first defense against specific infectious agents
(Michael, J.G., 1969, Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol.48:43-62),
and has recently been the subject of increased interest and
conjecture of a possible role in control of autoimmunity (Cohen,
I. et al., 1986, Immunol. Today7:363-364) or other phases of
immunoregulation (Dighiero, G. et al., 1985, J. Immunol.134:765). Natural antibodies frequently have been designated as
those of lower affinity than their induced counterparts (see,
e.g., Day, E.D. et al., J. Neuroimmunol.13:143-158, 1986; Hoch,
S. et al., J. Immunol.136:892-897, 1986; Tongio, M.M. et al.,
Tissue Antigens26:27-285, 1985).Natural antibodies, in accordance with the long held
and recently fortified hypothesis that the humoral immune system
includes a repertoire of "natural" (Jerne, N.K., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA41: 849, 1955) or "naive" (Berek, G. et al.,
Immunol. Rev.105: 5-26, 1988) antibodies, not attributable to
immune induction, are the subject of much speculation. The
various characteristics attributed to that class of antibodies
include: germ line configuration of VH and VL segments (Stollar,
D. Mol. Immunol.,28:1339, 1991; Sanz, I. et al., J. Immunol.142:4054, 1989), IgM of low affinity (Rodman, T.C. et al., Clin.
Immunol. Immunopath.57:430, 1990), secretion by CD5+B-cells
(Hayakawa, K. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA81:2494, 1984),
polyreactivity (Casali, P. et al., Immunol. Today10:364, 1989;

<CLAIMS>
An isolated human natural IgM antibody immunoreactive with an
epitope present on HIV-1 Tat protein, wherein said epitope comprises HIV-1 Tat

protein amino acid residue numbers 22-33.
A method for the prognosis or diagnosis of AIDS in an individual
infected with HIV comprising the steps of:


detecting or measuring natural human IgM antibodies in a body fluid
from said individual and determining a Δ20 - Δ2 value, said natural human IgM

antibodies being immunoreactive with an epitope present on HIV-1 Tat protein.
comparing said Δ20 - Δ2 value obtained from said individual with a
Δ20 - Δ2 value obtained from clinically normal, non-HIV infected humans,

   wherein said individual has AIDS or will progress to AIDS within
about two years if said individual's Δ20 - Δ2 value is significantly decreased relative

to the Δ20 - Δ2 value obtained from said clinically normal humans.
The method of claim 2 wherein said epitope on HIV-1 Tat protein
comprises amino acid residue numbers 48-59.
The method of claim 2 wherein said epitope on HIV-1 Tat protein
comprises amino acid residue numbers 22-33.
Use of a isolated natural human IgM antibody for the preparation of a
drug for the treatment of an HIV-infected individual, said drug being administered

at an amount effective for forestalling the progression to AIDS in said individual,
wherein said isolated natural human IgM antibody is immunoreactive with an

epitope present on HIV-1 Tat protein, wherein said epitope comprises HIV-1 Tat
protein amino acid residue numbers 48-59 or amino acid residue numbers 22-33.
A pharmaceutical formulation for administration to an HIV-infected
individual comprising natural human IgM antibodies and a pharmaceutically

acceptable carrier or diluent, wherein said natural human IgM antibodies are 
selected from the group consisting of natural human IgM antibodies

immunoreactive with HIV-1 Tat protein amino acid residue numbers 48-59, natural
human IgM antibodies immunoreactive with HIV-1 Tat protein amino acid residue
