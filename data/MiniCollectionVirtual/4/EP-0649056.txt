<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a silver halide color 
negative photographic element comprising a red 

sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a 
coupler which reacts with oxidized color developer to 

form a cyan dye, a blue sensitive silver halide 
emulsion layer containing a coupler which reacts with 

oxidized color developer to form a yellow dye, and a 
green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing 

a coupler which upon reaction with oxidized color 
developer forms a magenta image dye, the element 

additionally comprising a hue correction coupler 
associated with a green sensitive layer which coupler 

reacts with oxidized developer to form a magenta dye 
having a peak absorption between 565-600 nm so that the 

element has a D580/D550 ratio at neutral midscale 
exposure which is greater than that exhibited by the 

element without the hue correction coupler. The 
invention also provides a process for forming an image 

in the element described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to color negative
photographic elements exhibiting enhanced printer
compatibility containing a hue correction coupler which
produces a dye of peak absorbance of 565-600 nm after
reaction with oxidized developer.The color negative-positive photographic
system relies on the exposure of a scene onto a color
negative film. The exposed negative is then projected
onto a negative-working color photographic paper to
form, after development, the desired positive image.
In order to correctly expose the photographic paper,
the average density of the negative in all three color
records (red, green and blue) must be measured so that
the exposure time and balance between the amounts of
the R, G and B light used to expose the paper can be
adjusted.The general practice in the photofinishing
industry is to read the average color density of the
negative using red, green and blue filters. There is
no uniform standard for these filters. Different sets
of filters may read the same negative differently
because of variations in the amount of light they pass.
In most cases, this is not a problem since the response
of a printer filter set is accounted for in the
calculation for the subsequent exposure of the paper.
However, this method assumes that the measured red,
green and blue densities of any and all negatives to be
printed by a particular printer system reflects the
color balance of the original scene.Pyrazolotriazoles have been used as magenta
couplers in commercially available color negative films 
and can offer useful photographic advantages such as
high coupling efficiency, formaldehyde insensitivity
and low unwanted absorbance, even though they have high
pH sensitivity and complicated syntheses. The hues of
the magenta dyes formed from pyrazolotriazoles are
broad in terms of bandwidth, with substantial density
at wavelengths from 565 to 600 nm. Four-equivalent 1-phenyl-3-acylamino-5-pyrazolones
are also used as
magenta couplers in commercially available color
negative films and can offer useful photographic
advantages, even though they suffer from low coupling
efficiency and sensitivity to formaldehyde. The hues
of the magenta dyes formed from 1-phenyl-3-acylamino-5-pyrazolones
are broad in terms of bandwidth, with
substantial density at wavelengths from 560 to 590 nm,
similar to pyrazolotriazole based dyes.1-Phenyl-3-anilino-5-pyrazolones are also
used as magenta couplers in commercially available
color negative films and can offer useful photographic
advantages such as low pH sensitivity,
