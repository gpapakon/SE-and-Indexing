<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns antimicrobial agents,
a method of inhibiting the growth of microorganisms,
personal care and household cleaning compositions, a method
of preparing antimicrobial agents, a method of providing
protection to a substrate and a method for providing
spermicidal and virucidal protection to a substrate.The present invention relate, to novel
antimicrobial compositions and, more particularly, to a
class of compounds having specific quaternized amine
compounds linked to specific phosphate eaters which exhibit
broad spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal activity as well
as spermicidal and virucidal activity referred to
hereinafter as "antimicrobial phospholipids". The
phospholipid compositions of the invention are well
tolerated by human tissue making them suitable for use as
preservative and disinfectant components in the preparation
of personal care, household cleaning germicidal
disinfectant and cleaning and like products which exhibit
enhanced antimicrobial, antifungal and virucidal
characteristics, and in the preparation of therapeutic,
personal care and the like products useful as a
contraceptive and for the immobilization and/or killing of
human and animal sperm.Phosphate ester and quaternary amine compounds
are well known and have been widely used for many years for
a variety of applications including those requiring
surfactant properties. Known phosphate esters do not
generally exhibit any antimicrobial characteristics, and
while quaternary amine compounds are known in general to
exhibit antimicrobial activity, such compounds are
extremely irritating and thus have limited usefulness in
personal care and cosmetic products. More recently, various
betaine-type derivatives having, in general, quaternized
alkyl amine groups and at least one phosphorous-containing 
anion in the molecule referred to hereinafter as "synthetic
phospholipids", have been disclosed and suggested as, for
example, in US-A-4,215,064, 4,233,192 and 4,380,637
to Lindemann et at., US-A-4,209,449, 4,336,385 and
4,503,002 to Mayhew et al., and US-A-4,243,602,
4,283,542 and 4,336,386 to O'Lenick et al. These synthetic
phospholipids are suggested as exhibiting an outstanding
combination of surfactant characteristics as well as being
well tolerated by human tissue, i.e., they exhibit
exceptionally low ocular irritation and oral toxicity.
While these known phospholipids have been found useful as
surfactants in a variety of personal care, household
cleaning and the like products, such products also require
the
