<DESCRIPTION>
The invention belongs to the field of X-ray technics, or 
more concrete it belongs to X-ray impulse equipment with 
energy storage capacitors. Known X-ray impulse generators in the same insulated case 
are provided with a X-ray impulse tube, a high voltage 
impulse energy source based on one or two helix generators 
and discharge amplifier. Even if they are very compact, such generators have not 
particular high efficiency. The known X-ray impulse generator, which contains a X-ray 
impulse tube, has a discharge capacitor connected to the 
tube, and the impulse transformer, which through a secondary 
winding is connected to the discharge capacitor appears as 
a coaxial construction. The outer primary winding has a form 
of a solid cylinder, while inner secondary winding has a 
shape of a helix with truncated cone form. However, such a generator assumes that one does not use a 
discharge amplifier, which assures that the duration of the 
anterior front of the impulses generated by the X-ray 
radiation and stabilizes the radiation output at the high 
voltage side of the impulse transformer. Based on the electrical diagram of the generator, it will be 
a diagram having a high voltage impulse transformer and 
there in the circuit of the secondary winding of the 
transformer discharge capacitor, discharge amplifier and X-ray 
impulse tube is included.  In a construction such a diagram can be realized as X-ray 
impulse generator, where in the grounded metal casing a high 
voltage impulse transformer with coaxial outer primary 
winding and coaxial inner secondary winding, discharge 
capacitor, discharge amplifier and X-ray impulse tube is 
included. To that must be added that the discharge capacitor 
is formed by the casing and the cylinder shaped electrode, 
which is situated coaxially with the casing and which is 
electrically connected to the secondary winding of the 
impulse transformer. The cylinder shaped electrode includes 
a discharge amplifier, one electrode of which is 
electrically connected to the cylinder shaped electrode, and 
the other electrode is connected to the high voltage 
electrode of the X-ray impulse tube. A drawback with the generator known till now is the low 
efficiency, which is related to those non optimal conditions 
for conversion and energy transmission to the X-ray tube in 
the high voltage circuit. The object of the invention is to increase the efficiency of 
the generator by optimizing the electrical characteristic 
with the help of constructive means. Concerning the
