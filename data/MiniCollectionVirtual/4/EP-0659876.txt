<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to peroxyacid precursor particles, to processes for 
their manufacture and to detergent compositions containing them. More 
particularly the invention relates to peroxyacid precursor particles 
incorporating an acidic coating to provide a delayed start to perhydrolysis 
of the peroxyacid precursor at the start of a fabric washing cycle in an 
automatic washing machine. The incorporation of a peroxyacid precursor as a discrete particulate 
component of a fabric washing composition is well known in the art. The 
particulate may comprise the precursor as a crystalline material of the 
desired particle size as disclosed in GB-A-846798, but a more preferred 
form comprises an agglomerate of relatively finely divided precursor 
particles bound together by a binder or agglomerating agent. Examples of 
this type of precursor particle are discussed in EP-A-0070474, EP-A-0356700, 
EP-A-0375241 and WO92/13798. The last named Application also discloses the coating of the agglomerated 
precursor particle with an acidic material of Mpt > 30°C and defined 
minimum aqueous solubility at 20°C, in order to provide a low pH 
environment during the initial stages of dissolution/dispersion of the 
agglomerate in the aqueous wash pre-liquor. A low pH environment in the 
immediate vicinity of the peroxyacid precursor particle during the product 
dissolution/dispersion stage of the wash cycle prevents or minimises 
colour damage to fabrics, particularly where so called concentrated or 
'compact' detergent compositions are employed.  WO92/13798 teaches that the coating of acidic material should be applied 
as a melt for those acidic materials having of Mpt < 100°C and as a 
solution or dispersion for acidic materials of Mpt > 100°C. Electrostatic 
Powder coating is also mentioned as a possible technique of applying the 
acidic material to the agglomerate but is discounted on the grounds of 
difficulty and expense. Powder coating of an agglomerated particle containing a peroxyacid 
precursor is also disclosed in EP-B-0191396. A powder of fine-grained 
material of particle size 0.1-1mm is applied to the surface of an 
agglomerate of particle size 0.4-4mm and comprising a powder or fine 
grained component and at least 20% of a liquid component to give a dry, 
free flowing granulate. Notwithstanding the advances in the art represented by the above 
disclosures, difficulties have still been encountered in providing 
peroxyacid precursor particles having acceptable physical characteristics 
for bulk storage and
