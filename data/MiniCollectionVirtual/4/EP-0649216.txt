<ABSTRACT>
A vibration driven device includes a vibration 
member formed with a plurality of groove portions, and 

an electro-mechanical energy conversion element 
contacting the vibration member. The conversion 

element has a plurality of electrodes, and the 
vibration member is vibrated by applying a signal to 

the electrodes. All the two-end positions of the 
electrodes of the conversion element are shifted from 

the positions of the groove portions of the vibration 
member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibration
driven device represented by a vibration wave motor.A vibration wave motor, especially, a vibration
wave motor having a vibration member comprising, e.g.,
a ring-shaped vibration member or the like has the
following arrangement. Two groups of
electro-mechanical energy conversion elements (for
example, piezoelectric elements, magnetostrictive
elements, or the like; represented by piezoelectric
elements in the following description), which are
arranged to alternately have opposite polarities at a
pitch of a 1/2 wavelength in each group and to be
shifted by a 1/4 wavelength between the groups are
joined and fixed to a vibration member consisting of an
elastic member. AC voltages having a time phase
difference of about 90° are applied to these two
piezoelectric element groups (to be referred to as A
and B phases hereinafter) to generate a travelling
vibration wave in the vibration member, thereby
frictionally driving a movable member which is in press
contact with the vibration member. In this vibration
wave motor, when the vibration member is resonated by 
applying the AC voltages to the piezoelectric element
groups, each mass point of the vibration member
contacting the movable member makes a rotary elliptic
motion, and the movable member is frictionally driven
by the rotary elliptic motion. The radius of rotation,
in the circumferential direction of the vibration
member, of the rotary elliptic motion is proportional
to the distance from a neutral surface (a surface to
which no bending stress acts) to the mass point of the
surface of the vibration member. As this distance
becomes larger, the driving speed becomes higher if the
amplitude remains the same. Therefore, in order to
increase the driving speed for the same amplitude and
to improve efficiency, a so-called grooved vibration
wave motor, in which grooves are formed in the surface,
on the side of the movable member, of the vibration
member in a direction perpendicular to the travelling
direction of the vibration wave is known from EP-A-0536409,
against which claim 1 is delimited.However, in the grooved vibration wave motor,
since a grooved portion has a smaller geometrical
moment of inertia and a lower flexural rigidity than
those of a non-groove portion (to be referred to as a
projection hereinafter), the rigidity is not uniform in
the circumferential direction. For this reason, when a
standing wave is excited in the vibration member, a
partial difference is generated in the vibration
amplitude depending
