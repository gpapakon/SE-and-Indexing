<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an automatic device for producing 
a cooled semi-liquid food product, more specifically 
soft-ice, milk-shake or yoghurt, starting from a 
composition, which automatic device comprises a pump, a 
suction conduit connected at one end to the pump and at the 
during operation to a reservoir with the composition, a 
pressure conduit connecting at one end to the pump and the 
other end of which forms a draught end for the food 
product, a cooling element, of which the cooling part forms 
the evaporator of a cooling circuit and the cooled part is 
located in said pressure conduit and a cleaning device 
comprising in its turn a cleaning conduit, one end of which 
fits on a closable opening of the pressure conduit at or in 
the vicinity of the draught end, a closeable drain conduit 
connecting to this cleaning conduit, means for blocking the 
drain conduit and a liquid supply means. Such automatic devices are used for producing soft-ice or 
milk-shakes. A liquid composition is pumped from a 
reservoir, usually a supple bag, by means of the pump which 
also provides in an injection of air and thus the whipping 
of the mixture. The thus whipped mixture is consequently 
cooled in the cooling element. A rotating screw-shaped 
scraping is mounted around the cooling part of this 
element, scraping the whipped mixture over the cooling part 
and pushing it towards the draught end. Soft-ice is cooled 
in such a way that ice formation occurs around the cooling 
part.  
 Such automatic devices are also used for distributing 
yoghurt. With these automatic devices, the whipping with 
air is not necessary, and the pump does not inject air but 
is only used for pumping the yoghurt composition from the 
reservoir to the cooling element. It is generally known that the bacteriological cleanness of 
the food products produced by the above-mentioned automatic 
devices sometimes leaves much to be desired. This is caused 
by a lack of regular and effective cleaning of the parts 
coming in contact with the food product or the composition. 
In order to clean the known automatic device, the suction 
conduit has to be disconnected from the reservoir and has 
to be put consecutively connected in one of more reservoirs 
with liquids such as a cleaning liquid, a so called 
sanitary liquid and a rinsing liquid. A device of this kind is disclosed in US-A-2 977 097. In 
this device, the suction conduit is inserted in the 
reservoir with composition during operation. For cleaning, 
this suction conduit is directly
