<ABSTRACT>
The power train of a vehicle with two power axles (4x4 vehicle) comprises, starting from the engine transmission block 1, a transfer box with engageable and disengageable clutch 2, a front axle differential with locking clutch 3 and a rear axle differential with locking clutch 5. The power train also includes sensors 10, 11, 12 and actuators 13, 14, 15. The sensor 10 is a steering angle sensor. In this case the sensors 11 are rotational-speed sensors arranged near the edges (4, 6) and the sensors 12 are status sensors. In order to be able to automatically control all clutches according to the terrain, the control system 18 has a separate module (21, 24, 25) for each clutch (2, 3, 5), the control modules (24, 25) of the hierarchically lower clutches (3, 5) also emitting control signals for one or more hierarchically higher clutch or clutches (2, 5), before they activate their own clutch (3, 5) and the slip signals being slip summation signals formed by integration of the rotational speed differences and compared with slip summation threshold values.

System for the automatic control of the couplings 
(2,3,5;2,3,5,7,8) in the drive train of an all-wheel-driven 

off-the-road vehicle, wherein slip signals are derived from 
rotational wheel speed signals and the slip signals are 

compared with threshold values, whereby control signalsfor the 
couplings (2,3,5; 7,8) are generated, 
characterized
 in that 

a) a dedicated control module (21,24,25; 21,22,23,24,25) 
generating control signals for its own coupling is provided for 

each separate coupling (2,3,5,7,8); 
b) the control modules (24,25;21,23,24,25) of the hierarchically 
lower couplings (3,5; 2,3,5,8) also emit control signals 

for one or several hierarchically higher coupling(s) (2,5;2,5, 
7,8) before actuating their own couplings; 
c) the slip signals are slip total signals (phi_nach
(after)
, 
phi_vor
(before)
) and are compared with slip total threshold values 
(SSS_*_by_*). 
System as in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the slip total 
threshold values (SSS_QSpHA_by_QSpVA, SSS_LSp_by_QSpVA, SSS_ 

LSp_by_QSpHA; SSS_QSpHA_by_QSpVA, SSS_LSp_by_QSpVA, SSS_ZSp_ 
by_QSpVA, SSS_LSp_by_QSpHA, SSS_ZSp_by_QSpHA) in the control 

modules (24,25;21,23,24,25) of the hierarchically lower couplings 
(2,5;2,3,5,8) for engagement of hierarchically higher 

couplings (2,5;2,5,7,8) are lower than the slip total threshold 
values (SSS_QSpVA, SSS_QSpHA; SSS_QSpVA, SSS_QSpHA, 

SSS_LSp) for engagement of their own couplings (3,5; 2,3,5,8) 
and in that upon reaching these threshold values, a holding 

function (125,130) ensures that the coupling remains engaged 
for a given period of time, in addition to triggering the 

engagement of the hierarchically higher coupling (2,5;2,5,7,8).  
 
System as in claim 2 with permanent rear axle drive and 
connectable front axle drive, 
characterized
 in that the coupling 
(2) for the connection of the front axle drive can be 

closed by its own module (21), by a transversal rear axle 
locking module (24; 23,24) and by a transversal front axle 

locking module (25) and in that the transversal rear axle 
locking module (24; 23,24) holds the coupling (2) for the 

connection of the front wheel drive in engagement for a given 
period of time. 
System as in claim 2 with permanently driven of rear and 
front axles and an engageable longitudinal locking mechanism, 


characterized

can be closed by its own module (21), by a transversal rear 

axle locking module (24; 23,24) and by a transversal front axle 
locking module (25) and in that the transversal rear axle 

locking module (24; 23,24) and the transversal front axle 
locking module (25) hold the coupling of the locking mechanism 

(2) in engagement for a given period of time. 
System as in claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the coupling 
(5;5,8) of the transversal rear axle locking mechanism can be 

closed by its own module (24; 23,24) and by the transversal 
front axle locking module (25) and in that the module of the 

transversal front axle locking mechanism (25) holds the 
coupling (5; 5,8) of the transversal rear axle locking mechanism 

in engagement for a given period of time. 
System as in claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the module (25) 
of the transversal front axle locking can close only its own 

coupling (3). 
System as in claim 3 or 4 with two driven rear axles and an 
intra-axle locking mechanism, 
characterized
 in that the coupling 
(7) of the intra-axle locking mechanism can be closed by 

its own module (22) and by the modules (23,24) of the transversal 
locking mechanisms of the two rear axles and in that the  

 
module (21) of the longitudinal differential, the module (23, 

24) of the transversal rear axle locking mechanism and the 
module (25) of the transversal front axle locking mechanism 

holds the coupling (7) of the locking mechanism of the intra-axle 
differential in engagement for a given period of time. 
System as in claim 7, 
characterized
 in that the couplings 
(5,8) of the two transversal rear axle locking mechanisms are 

associated with a common module. 
System as in claim 2, 
characterized
 in that beyond a certain 
speed, the couplings (3,5; 3,5,8) of the transversal locking 

mechanisms themselves cannot be closed, but their modules 
(24,25; 23,24,25) are able to close a hierarchically higher 

coupling (5,2; 5,8,2,7). 
System as in claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the slip total 
thresholds (SSS_*) are at such levels that separate couplings 

cannot be switched simultaneously. 
System as in claim 10, 
characterized
 in that the actuators 
(13,14,15; 16,13,14,17,15) of these couplings are connected in 

series in order to provide redundant safety. 
System as in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the coupling 
(2) of the longitudinal locking mechanism or the connection of 

the front axle drive and possibly also the coupling (7) of the 
intra-axle locking mechanism are engaged during braking. 
System as in claim 1, 
characterized

the control of the signals of the status sensors (12).

(10). 
System as in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that indivudual 
rotational wheel speed differences (DN_SL) are compared with 

threshold values (DN_SL_MIN) below which they are not taken 
into account when calculating the slip total (phi_vor
(before)
, 
phi_nach
(after)
), but which are used for the calibration of 
signals (e.g. the signals of the steering angle sensor (10)). 
System as in one of the claims 1 to 14, 
characterized
 in 
that the couplings (2,3,5; 2,3,5,7,8) are positive couplings 

which are engaged by single-acting actuators (13,14,15;13,14, 
15,16,17) and are disengaged by spring force when the transmitted 

torque drops below a given value. 
System as in claim 16, 
characterized
 in that a closed 
coupling (2,3,5; 2,3,5,7,8) is held in its closed state during 

gear shifting in the main transmission (1).
