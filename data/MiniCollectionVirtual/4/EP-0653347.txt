<ABSTRACT>
A front derailleur for a bicycle has a four-point link mechanism, 
and a 

control cable (12A) is attached by a screw (11) to an end of a connecting 
arm (5C) fixed to one 

link (5) of the four-point link mechanism. The connecting (5C) arm has 
an auxiliary 

projection (5D). The control cable (12A) applies 
a torque to the link (5) at 

a point of contact (5E) 
between the control cable (12A) and the auxiliary projection (5D) . The 

screw (11) on the connecting 
arm (5C) is spaced from a chain guide (7A,7B,7C) 

which contacts a chain (9), to 
facilitate an operation 

to attach the control cable (12A) to the connecting arm (5C).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a front derailleur for a bicycle, and more
particularly to a connection between the front derailleur and a control cable.Generally, a front derailleur includes a fixed section fixed to a bicycle frame,
and a movable section supported to be movable relative to the fixed section.
The movable section supports a chain guide having a pair of vertical surfaces
for contacting a chain.The movable section is movable relative to the fixed section by pulling a
shift control cable. The movable section and fixed section usually are
interconnected through pivotal links. The control cable is connected to one of
the pivotal links to apply a torque thereto, thereby to swing the link to move the
movable section. The control cable is fixed to the link in such a position that an
operating force applied to the control cable is converted into a link swinging
torque efficiently. However, in a front derailleur having the fixed section
disposed below the movable section, in particular, the above-noted position is
not necessarily suited for an operation to attach the control cable to the pivotal
link. Document US 4 330 137 discloses a front derailleur apparatus for a bicycle for
shifting a chain between a plurality of chain wheels. The apparatus comprises a
movable member for shifting the chain and a fixed member supporting the
movable member by a four-point link mechanism. One link is connected to an
arm member including a cable connector for fixing a control cable to the arm
member. Thus, this document discloses the features according to the preamble of
claim 1.Document FR-A-23 46 204 discloses a shifting device comprising two levers for
pulling and releasing two control cables. Each lever is fixedly connected to a
control cable which is wound of unwound around an outer surface of the lever.
The radius of the outer surface of each lever differs, so that the outer surface
forms a cam. The object of the present invention is to provide a front derailleur having
means to convert an operating force of a control cable efficiently into a torque
for swinging a pivotal link, with the control cable connected to the pivotal link
in a position suited for an attaching operation although the fixed section is 
disposed below the movable section.The above object is fulfilled, according to the present invention, by a front
derailleur
comprising
a fixed section for fixing to a bicycle frame, a chain guide for contacting a
chain to shift the chain, a movable section connected to the fixed section and
fixedly
