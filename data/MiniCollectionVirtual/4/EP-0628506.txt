<ABSTRACT>
Device to draw threads (11) and/or broken threads (111) 
being unwound between a beam and a winding machine (13), the 

device cooperating with one guide tube (14) per each thread 
(11-111) and comprising a plurality of guide tubes (14) in 

close proximity to each other, each guide tube (14) 
including a conveyor tube (32) comprising means to aspirate/eject 

thread, which can be momentarily actuated and are 
associated with means that sense broken thread (111) and 

with means for the controlled braking and acceleration of 
the beam of the winding machine (13), the means to 

aspirate/eject thread being associated with an airtight box-shaped 
chamber (17) containing a plurality of guide tubes 

(14) and put momentarily under pressure, the thread 
aspiration/ejection means consisting of injection holes (21) 

which connect at an angle the box-shaped chamber (17) to the 
inside of each conveyor tube (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a device to draw threads being
unwound between a beam and a winding machine, as set forth
in the main claim.The invention is employed advantageously in cooperation
with winding machines fed by beams of yarns and used
downstream of textile processes such as continuous
mercerisation, for instance.A plurality of threads or yarns being fed parallel to each
other and coming from one or more beams is taken up at the
same time by these winding machines.The invention is set to work advantageously for a pre-set
limited time before the beginning of the continuous
unwinding operation while the individual ends of the
plurality of threads or yarns have to be brought to their
corresponding winding heads to be anchored.The invention is also advantageously set to work
automatically whenever at least one thread or yarn of the
plurality of threads or yarns being unwound from the beam is
broken.By textile threads or yarns are meant materials consisting
of continuous or discontinuous fibres of a natural or
chemical origin as normally included in processes of the
textile field.In textile processes where it is advantageous to treat a
plurality of threads or yarns continuously at the same time,
that plurality can be taken up on supports such as beams, to
which we shall refer in the description that follows.When we write of a plurality of threads or yarns, we mean
a quantity which may amount to between some tens and some
thousands. In any event each packaged beam, whether it contains tens
or thousands of threads or yarns, entails the problem of
having to be unwound when those threads or yarns are to be
used singly thereafter.This takes place, for instance, when their purpose is to
feed knitting machines or to act as warp in weaving machines
or to be dyed or for many other analogous applications.In general the preferred package is a bobbin, whether
cylindrical or tapered, of various gauges according to the
specific use.There is then the problem of unwinding from the beam the
plurality of threads or yarns wound thereon and of
delivering those threads or yarns individually to their
respective winding units.It is obvious that this operation entails many problems
linked above all to the presence of many threads or yarns in
movement in close proximity to each other, such problems
being well known to any person skilled in the textile field.Moreover, the ever greater need to take up as little space
as possible for obvious financial reasons is in contrast
with the situation of having to have available a very

<CLAIMS>
Device to draw threads (11) and/or broken threads (111)
being unwound between a beam and a winding machine (13), the

device comprising one guide tube (14) per each thread
(11-111), the plurality of

guide tubes (14) being in close proximity to each other, and
each guide tube (14) including a conveyor tube (32)

comprising means to aspirate and eject thread, which can be
momentarily actuated and are associated with means that

sense broken thread (111) and
wherein the means to aspirate/eject thread are

associated with an airtight box-shaped chamber (17)
characterized in that the device comprises means for a controlled

braking and acceleration of the beam and of the winding machine
13, the airtight box-shaped chamber

containing a plurality of guide tubes (14) and being put
momentarily under pressure, the thread aspiration/ejection

means consisting of injection holes (21) which connect at an
angle the box-shaped chamber (17) to the inside of each

conveyor tube (32).
Device as in Claim 1, in which each conveyor tube (32)
can be replaced by being withdrawn from the box-shaped

chamber (17).
Device as in Claim 1 or 2, in which an assembly holding
a buffer stock of thread is included between the beam and

the plurality of guide tubes (14).
Device as in any claim hereinbefore, in which each
switch means (22) is associated with a specific deflection

plate (33) (Fig.3).
Device as in any of Claims 1 to 4 inclusive, in which
each switch means (22) is associated with a thread take-up

chamber (30) (Figs.6).
Device as in any claim hereinbefore, in which the
airtight box-shaped chamber (17) contains a plurality of

compartments, with each of which is associated its own duct
