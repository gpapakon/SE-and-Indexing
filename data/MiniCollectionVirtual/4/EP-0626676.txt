<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus 
capable of recording video, audio and other information 

on a magnetic tape by, for example, the helical 
scanning method. A rotary head is rotated at an m-fold 

speed to record intermittent tracks on the magnetic 
tape so that real-time simultaneous monitoring 

is performed. By high-speed dubbing due to high-density 
intermittent recording and by increasing the 

number of repetition of track scanning, the information 
is recorded and reproduced simultaneously with a 

plurality of channels. Any tracking error is detected 
to form a continuous and uniform track pattern. With 

this intermittent comb-shaped recording, reciprocating 
recording and reproducing can be realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic recording
and reproducing apparatus for recording video and
audio information on a magnetic tape in a helically
scanning system.For accurately recording a digital video signal
and a digital audio signal by a digital video tape recorder,
it has hitherto necessary to confirm the state
of recording by reproducing the recorded data soon
after recording, namely, to perform simultaneous
monitoring. FIG. 16 shows the location of magnetic heads in
a prior art magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus
exemplified by Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication
No.61165801/1986. FIG. 17 shows a track pattern
of recording onto a magnetic tape by the magnetic
heads.In FIG. 16, a pair of first magnetic heads 301-1,
301-2 are arranged on the peripheral edge of a
rotary drum 302 and are angularly spaced from each
other by 180°, and likewise, a pair of second magnetic
heads 301-3, 301-4 are arranged on the peripheral edge
of the rotary drum 302 and are angularly spaced from
each other by 180°. The second magnetic heads 301-3,
301-4 are angularly spaced from the first magnetic
heads 301-1, 301-2, respectively, by 90°.In FIG. 17, the magnetic tape 310 is fed in the 
direction of an arrow R. 311-1 designates a track recorded
by the first magnetic head 301-1; 311-2, a
track recorded by the second magnetic head 301-3; 311-3,
a track recorded by the first magnetic head 301-2;
and 311-4, a track recorded by the second magnetic
head 301-4. These four recording tracks 311-1 through
311-4 constitute one frame of recording data.FIG. 18 is a block diagram showing recording
signal processing system when digitally recording 2-channel
video signals simultaneously in the arrangement
and track pattern of the magnetic heads of FIGS.
16 and 17.A first low-pass filter (hereinafter called
"first LPF") 350 performs a band restriction to sample
a first video signal. A second LPF 350-2 performs a
band restriction of a second video signal.A first A/D converter 351-1 samples the first
video signal, and a second A/D converter 351-2 samples
the second video signal.A first encoder 352-1 encodes digital data from
the first A/D converter 351-1 by adding an error correcting
code thereto. A second encoder 352-2 encodes
digital data from the second A/D converter 351-2 in
the same manner. A first memory 338-1 is used in encoding
by the first encoder 352-1, and a second memory
338-2 is used in encoding by the second encoder 352-2. 
A first modulator 353-1 encodes the digital data,
which were encoded by the first encoder
