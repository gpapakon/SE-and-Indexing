<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a spark plug for an internal combustion engine, comprising a housing (12), an insulator (16), which is situated in said housing and which consists of a sintered ceramic material, and a centre electrode (18) and a connecting bolt (22) which are electroconductively interconnected and which are situated in the insulator. The aim of the invention is to improve the seal between the insulator and the centre electrode. To this end, a cermet whose ceramic phase consists of the same or a similar material to the insulator and whose metallic phase consists of a material with good electroconductivity adjoins the centre electrode. The cermet has similar properties to the insulator, especially the same thermal expansion, which results in a particularly good seal between the cermet and the insulator body.
