<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for cleaning, disinfecting, storing and wetting rigid gas permeable contact lenses is provided. The system includes a cleaning, disinfecting and storing solution and a separate wetting solution. Both solutions contain hydrophilic disinfectants or preservatives which do not inhibit proper wetting of rigid gas permeable contact lenses. The lenses are stored in the cleaning, disinfecting and storing solution during nonwearing periods. This storage also acts as a secondary or backup cleaning treatment to help remove any residual contaminants after the primary cleaning with this solution. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a preservative system is provided for a contact lens solution that comprises high purity benzyl alcohol.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cold disinfecting aqueous solution for
disinfecting soft contact lenses, a method of disinfecting soft contact lenses
using such a solution, and to a preserved ophthalmic drug solution that avoids
ocular irritation and which includes an ophthalmic drug solution such as an
over-the-counter or prescription ophthalmic drug solution.EP-A-0358447 is mainly concerned with solutions for cleaning, conditioning
and storing, or wetting, rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses. However,
it also discloses a daily cold disinfecting solution for soft contact lenses
having the composition:-
1% by wt benzyl alcohol containing less than 100 ppm benzaldehyde; 1.0%
by weight Miranol M5-1 (a surfactant); 0.12% by wt boric acid; 0.12% by
wt sodium borate; 0.15% by wt sodium edetate; 0.3% by wt sodium
chloride; 0.01% by wt sodium biphosphate; and 0.01% by wt sodium
phosphate.EP-A-0175490 discloses cleaning, disinfecting and wetting solutions for rigid
and soft contact lenses. In particular, it discloses a sterile contact lens
disinfectant composition which comprises trimethoprim, benzyl alcohol and,
optimally one or more EDTA, propylene glycol and salts (bicarbonate 
phosphates and chlorate). The benzaldehyde content of the benzyl alcohol is unspecified.US-A-4529535, US-A-4560491 and US-A-4626292 disclose preservative
systems for incorporation into aqueous wetting and rewetting systems for
contact lenses, especially silicone copolymer (gas-permeable) and soft
contact lenses. The preservative systems according to US-A-4529535
and US-A-4626292 include trimethoprim, a salt of EDTA and sorbic acid
or ascorbic acid as adjuvant bactericides. The preservative system
according to US-A-4560491 includes trimethoprim and benzyl alcohol as
an adjuvant bactericide and optionally a salt of EDTA. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
cold disinfecting aqueous solution for disinfecting soft contact lenses
comprising from 0.05% to 1.0%, based on the weight of the total aqueous
solution, of benzyl alcohol containing less than or equal to 100 ppm by
weight of benzaldehyde; and from 0.05% to 5.0%, based on the weight of
the total aqueous solution, of isopropyl alcohol.Preferably, the benzyl alcohol is present in an amount of 0.33% by weight of
the total aqueous composition. Preferably also, the isopropyl alcohol is
present in an amount of about 0.1 % to about 5.0%, more preferably about
1.5%, by weight of the total composition.Preferably, a water soluble salt of EDTA is
