light (2) and capable of switching the said 

photosensitive element into one or the other of two 
different states: 


a positive accumulation state (AP), activated at 
least over the duration of emission of the flashes 

of light (2), in which state the accumulation 
capacitor (12) is charged by the electric current 

generated by the light energy reaching the said

diode and a switching system (9), controlled by the said 
control device (4) and capable of linking the 

accumulation capacitor (12), on the one hand, to one (6)

accumulation state (AP) and, on the other hand, to the 
other (7) of the said photosensitive diodes in the 

negative accumulation state (AN).

Claim 5, characterized in that it includes an input shift 
register (35) capable of controlling all the systems (31) 

for initialization of the said photosensitive elements
