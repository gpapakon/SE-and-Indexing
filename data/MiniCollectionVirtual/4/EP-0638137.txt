Process for the excavation of tunnels by means of an 
excavating shield, in particular a shield of the ground 

pressure type, comprising a cutting disc and a containment 
chamber, characterized in that a foam is injected in front of 

the said cutting disc and/or into the said containment 
chamber, the said foam being generated by activating a foaming 

agent comprising at least one surface active agent and at 
least one foaming auxiliary selected from the group consisting 

of fatty amines, fatty alcohols with C
