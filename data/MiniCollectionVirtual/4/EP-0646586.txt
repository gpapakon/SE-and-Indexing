<ABSTRACT>
2-Aminoethanesulfonic acid/zinc complex compound represented by formula (I), a process for the production thereof, 
and antihepatitis drug, hepatic function ameliorant and antiulcer drug each containing the compound [I]
 as the active ingredient. 

This compound is more excellent in antihepatitis activity than 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, glutathione and glycyrrhizin, has a 
potent detoxicating activity against various compounds to thereby improve the hepatic function, is excellent also in the antiulcer 

activity, and is extremely reduced in toxicity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid 
zinc complex compound, a process for producing the same and an 
anti-hepatitis agent, liver function improving agent and 
anti-ulcer agent which individually contain the same as an 
active ingredient. 2-Aminoethanesulfonic acid (taurine) is already known to 
possess liver function protecting activity, but with its weak 
activity, cannot be expected to find application as an 
excellent anti-hepatitis agent and liver function improving 
agent. The present Inventors discovered that the reaction of 
2-aminoethanesulfonic acid with an alkali agent and zinc 
compound can yield [bis(2-aminoethanesulfonic acid).bis(alkali 
2-aminoethanesulfonate)]zinc as represented by the following 
formula (JP-A-4-24642 (1992), corresponding to EP-A-0 623 623): 
 
(wherein M is an alkali metal). The compounds of the formula (A), which possess greater 
antihepatitis activity, liver function improving activity and 
antiulcer activity than 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, show 
relatively reduced zinc contents, as low as 10.76 and 10.21 % 
in the cases of M being sodium and potassium, respectively. In 
the light of the above, the inventors carried out further 
research and synthesized bis(2-aminoethanesulfonic acid)zinc 
with a zinc content of 20.85 %. Pharmacological tests indicate  
 
that the zinc complex compound, when compared with the 
compounds of the formula (A), exhibits more markedly potent 
anti-ulcer activity as well as comparable anti-hepatitis and 
liver function improving activities. EP-A-0206692 discloses solid or semi-solid pharmaceutical 
compositions containing physiologically acceptable zinc 
compounds capable of sustained release of zinc ions for 
topical application to external wounds to enhance tissue 
regeneration. Exemplified zinc compounds include zinc taurine 
but, unlike the complex of the present invention, zinc taurine 
is water-soluble (see EP-A-0206692 at, for example, column 2, 
lines 35/47 and column 10, lines 22/26). The present invention provides a 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid 
zinc complex compound represented by formula [I]: 
 
and a process for producing the same as well as to an 
antihepatitis agent, liver function improving agent and 
anti-ulcer agent. The compound of formula (I) can be produced by reacting a 
zinc compound (0.5 mole) with an alkali metal 2-aminoethanesulfonate 
(1 mole). The alkali metal 2-aminoethanesulfonate can be prepared by 
reacting 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (1 mole) with an alkali 
agent (1 mole). The
