<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of resistive 
sheet transfer recording using a recording member and an 

electrode head comprising oppositely aligned electrode pair 
trains embeded in the insulating support member and also relates 

to an electrode head used therefor, wherein abrasive wear of the 
electrode pair by sliding contact of the recording member is 

optimized in a manner that the resistive sheet usually contacts 
to a fresh surface of the electrode pair train. 
The present invention make it possible to give a high 
quality image with high recording speed and high sensitivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of resistive 
sheet transfer printing and an electrode head used in the field 
of image-forming technique for producing a high quality image 
with high speed and high sensitivity. A high-speed production of a full-color image is 
suitably realized by a resistive sheet color transfer printing 
technology by means of current-carrying using a recording member 
(including an ink sheet made of a resistive sheet carrying 
thereon an ink containing a pigment or sublimable dye and an 
image receiving member having a color development layer in the 
surface thereof) and an electrode head. The electrode head has a 
multistylus thereof held by a plurality of insulating support 
members generally made of a thermo-setting resin, glaze or 
ceramics such as alumina. The same materials is used for both 
inside and outside of electrode pairs. In a case where a binary recording image at a high 
speed is realized by using a sublimable dye as the color 
materials in order to produce a full color and high quality 
image, a conventional electrode head poses the following problems 
to be solved owing to the requirement of a high recording energy: The insulating support members for the heads can not be  
 
optimaized in a thermo-mechanical characteristics; Realization of high recording speed and sensitivity can 
not be fully accomplished;
 
   Recording dots is not optimized and stable transit of 
continuous recording is not fully and practically realized. 
Especially, under a high speed recording, that is, under a high 
temperature and pressure, wearability of the insulating support 
member for the head on which surface the resistive sheet of the 
recording member is sliding, has not been controlled, so that 
there is a big problem that contact failure between the 
multistylus head pairs and the resistive sheet occurs, there by 
making it difficult to subject the resistive sheet to continuous 
record running and causing a image an inferior quality. 
Furthermore, the thermal constant of the insulating support 
member has not been controlled, so that for instance if the 
insulating support member having a small thermal diffusion 
coefficient is used for the head, sensitivity would be improved 
but the recorded image color would become less clear and the 
resolution thereof would be reduced due to heat storage. On the 
contrary, if the insulating support member having a large thermal 
diffusion coefficient is used, sensitivity would be lowered and 
also the feature of resistive sheet
