<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for finish-grinding premachined annular disc-shaped metallic workpieces (1) with a workpiece receptacle (4) and a grinding tool receptacle (5). The grinding tool is a ring tool (8) with a ring-shaped grindstone (9) which, during the grinding operation, projects on the outside beyond the edge of the annular disc-shaped workpiece (1). On the end face (10), arranged orthogonally to the axis of the drive shaft (6), of the drive shaft (6) for the grinding tool receptacle (5) there is located, coaxially to the axis of the drive shaft (6), a spherical cap (11) which is rigidly connected to the drive shaft (6). The ring tool (8) has a central spherical joint cup (12) adapted to the spherical cap (11). Between the ring tool (8) and the end face (10) of the drive shaft (6) for the grinding tool receptacle (5) and also, if necessary, the fastening elements (13) for the ring tool (8) there are located elastomeric supporting elements (14). The arrangement is designed, with the interposition of gap spaces (15), such that the ring tool (8), placed with grinding pressure onto the annular disc-shaped workpiece (1), undergoes a follow-up control on the annular disc-shaped workpiece (1), with deflection about the pivot point (16) of the ball-and-socket joint (11, 12) formed from the spherical cap (11) and the spherical joint cup (12).
