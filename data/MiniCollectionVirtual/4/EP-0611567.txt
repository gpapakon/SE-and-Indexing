<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrafine
particle powder for inhalation, and a method for the
production thereof. The present invention relates in
more detail, to an ultrafine particle powder for
inhalation comprising a specific cellulose lower alkyl
ether and a medicament, at least 80% of said powder
having a particle size of 0.5 to 10 µm, a method for the
production thereof, and a powder preparation for
inhalation comprising the same.An inhalant is a preparation intended to be
administered as a medicament from an oral cavity or nasal
cavity mainly to a lower airway such as a trachea,
bronchi and alveoli. A lower airway, of an airway, is
defined herein as a trachea, bronchi, bronchioles,
alveoli, etc.Inhalants are expected to target organs, to act as
preparations for local administration to thoracopathy
such as asthma, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema of
medicaments, and to relieve side effects and realize
quick efficacy on the basis of the targeting, and many of
them have already been practically used. Much attention
has recently been drawn to inhalants as medicaments to be
generally administered to transfer physiologically active
peptides, proteins, etc., from alveoli to a blood stream
(V.H.L. Lee, "Peptide and Protein Drug Delivery," Marcel
Dekker, 1991, pp. 1-56). Furthermore, vaccine
preparations such as an influenza vaccine have also been
tried to induce local immunity by inhalation of an
antigen.Such inhalants can be classified as follows
according to a state of the particles depositing within 
an airway: (1) a solution depositing as droplets; and
(2) an aerosol or powder depositing as powder. A
solution is usually an aqueous solution of a medicament.
It is formed into mist by a nebulizer, (or atomizer) and
administered to within an airway as minute droplets,
thereby depositing within the airway in the form of
droplets. On the other hand, in the case of aerosol, a
medicament is usually filled in a pressurized container
in the form of a dispersion or solution in
fluorohydrocarbon. When the aerosol is released
therefrom at the time of administration,
fluorohydrocarbon is gradually vaporized, and the
dispersed or dissolved medicament gradually becomes a
fine particle powder, which finally deposits within the
airway as a fine particle powder. Moreover, in the case
of a powder, a fine particle powder containing a
medicament is filled as a powder in a container such as a
hard capsule. A patient usually inhales it as powder
mist therefrom by patient's own inspired air through a
suitable
