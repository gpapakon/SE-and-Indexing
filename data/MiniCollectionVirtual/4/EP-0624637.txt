<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a difunctional
catalyst useful in the hydromerization of waxes, and
to the process for preparing it
   More particularly, the present invention relates
to a difunctional catalyst consisting of:
(a) silica particles partially coated with zirconia
and acidified by means of the introduction of
sulfate moieties,(b) one or more metals belonging to Group VIIIA.The present invention relates as well to the
preparation of the above said catalyst and the use
thereof in the hydroisomerization of waxes.The process for wax isomerization to yield bases
for lubricant oils characterized by low "pour point"
and high viscosity index values, requires that
suitable catalysts are used.In fact, the waxes, mainly (> 80% by weight)
constituted by n-paraffins having more than 15 carbon
atoms, solid at room temperature, must be converted
into their corresponding branched isomers, which
display a lower melting point than the linear isomers.For instance, n-C16 paraffin has a melting point
of 19°C, whereas its 5-methyl pentadecane isomer melts
at -31°C.However, an effective hydroisomerization catalyst
should keep the possible cracking and hydrocracking
reactions, which are catalyzed by the same acidic
sites and have, as their intermediates, the same 
useful carbocations for hydroisomerization, to a
minimum. These secondary reactions lead to the
degradation of the molecule, with lighter, less
valuable products being formed, which must be removed
from the end product because they increase the
volatility thereof; of course, this constitutes a
burden for the overall process.For this process, difunctional catalysts were
developed, i. e., catalysts having both acidic sites
and hydro-dehydrogenation active sites. The acidity is
given to the catalyst by the selected carrier type,
and its function precisely is the isomerizing
property.The hydro-dehydrogenation activity is given to
the catalyst by the deposited metal phase, the
function of which is also of keeping cracking to a
minimum.It was demonstrated in the past (J. F. Le Page,
Applied Heterogeneous Catalysis, Ed. Technip, Paris,
1987, 435-466) that, with the hydrogenating activity
being the same, the most selective catalysts are those
in which the carrier displays a controlled acidity, so
as to maximize the isomerization of n-paraffins at the
expense of cracking. However, inasmuch as the cracking
reactions follow isomerization, the maximal
isomerization selectivity is obtained at low
conversion levels (G. Froment et al., Ind. Eng. Chem.
Prod. Res. Dev.,
