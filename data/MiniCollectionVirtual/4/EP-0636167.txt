<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dried dust free particles. In particular the
invention relates to particles which have been coated with a non-water soluble but
water-dispersible coating of an isophtalic acid polymer. The particles are
particularly useful for use in combination with laundry detergent granules.When formulating dried particulate products such as would be made in a
fluid bed dryer (e.g. particles for use in washing compositions), two
problems normally occur. The first problem is that of dusting. The method
of manufacturing particles can create very fine powders which cause
dermatologic effects when the product contains sensitizing agents (e.g.
enzymes in a detergent granule). The second problem relates to the need to
incorporate relatively high amounts of ingredients such as enzyme
protecting agents, masking agents and scavengers (e.g. chlorine scavengers)
into products for the purpose of binding ions which can inactivate an
active ingredient in the particle. It would be desirable to use less of
these types of materials or to use them without interfering with enzymes
that may be present.Many commercially useful enzymes are produced by microorganisms,
particularly bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi. These enzymes are
especially useful in detergent and food applications. With the advent of
biotechnology and recombinant DNA techniques, other enzymes from mammalian
sources are produced recombinantly in microorganisms. When enzymes are
produced in a microbial host they are usually either secreted directly into
the fermentation both by the microorganism or released into the
fermentation broth by lysing the cell. The enzyme can then be recovered
from the broth in a soluble form by a number of techniques including
filtration, centrifugation, membrane filtration, chromatography and the
like. The dissolved enzyme can be converted to a dry form from a liquid
using techniques such as precipitation, crystallization or spray-drying. A
problem associated with dry enzyme preparations is that there is a high
dust level associated with them, which can cause dermatologic distress to
the manufacturer, consumer or any other person handling the enzyme. It has
been a desire in the art to treat these dry enzymes so as to reduce the
hazard of dusting. To control dusting and increase particle size, dry 
enzymes are often granulated by various means known by those skilled in the
art.Various enzyme formulations and processes for these preparations have been
developed in an effort to alleviate the dusting problem. For

<CLAIMS>
A particulate material, the particles of which have a size
in the area of 150 - 1500 microns, consisting of (a) a core of a

water-soluble or water-dispersible solid, which core is spray-coated with a
material to be released in aqueous solutions, and (b) a

continuous layer of a non-water soluble but water-dispersible polymer, which will cause
the delayed release of the spray-coated material in aqueous

solutions and wherein said non-water soluble polymer is present
in an amount of from 2 - 10 % of w/w of the coated particulate material,

characterized in that said continuous layer (b) comprises as said
non-water soluble but water-dispersible polymer a non-water soluble isophthalic acid

polymer.
A particulate material according to claim 1, characterized
in that said polymer is poly[82/18-isophthalic acid/5-sodiosulfoisphthalic

acid 54/46-diethylene-glycol/1,4-cyclohexane
dimethanol]
.
A particulate material according to claim 1, characterized
in that the material to be released in aqueous solutions is a

detergent, an enzyme, an ion scavenger, a masking agent or an enzyme
protecting agent.
