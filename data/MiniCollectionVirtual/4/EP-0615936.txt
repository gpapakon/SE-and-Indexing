<ABSTRACT>
A bucket elevator (1) with a region (2) extending substantially vertically and cooperating at its lower end with a region (3) extending substantially horizontally is proposed, the horizontal region (3) being displaceable with respect to the vertical region (2). Both in the vertical and in the horizontal region (2 and 3, respectively), drivable material pick-up elements (buckets 4) are provided. The horizontal region (3) comprises a parallelogram formed from horizontal links (8, 9) and links (10, 11) articulated between the latter, at least one actuating element (hydraulic cylinder 18) acting at least on one of the movable links (10).

Bucket elevator (1), in particular a ship loading or 
unloading system, with a region (2) extending 

essentially vertically, a region (3) connecting to its 
lower end and extending essentially horizontally, and 

endless driving elements (chains 5) having material 
collecting elements (buckets 4) and encompassing the 

vertical and horizontal regions (2 and 3 respectively), 
whereby an upper and a lower guide (19, 20 and 19', 20' 

respectively) are provided in the horizontal region (3) 
for the driving elements (5) and/or material collecting 

elements, and the position of the lower guide (19', 20') 
may be varied relative to the vertical region (2) by 

means of a parallelogram articulation arrangement (guide 
bars 8 to 11) with two downwardly directed swivelling 

connecting guide rods (10, 11), and at least one 
operating element (hydraulic cylinder 18) acts on one of 

the connecting guide rods (10),
 
characterised in that 


the upper guide (19, 20) is formed by an upper 
horizontal guide bar (8) belonging to the parallelogram 

articulation arrangement, and constitutes a fixed part 
of the horizontal region (3); 
that the lower guide (19', 20') is formed by a lower 
horizontal guide bar (9) belonging to the parallelogram 

articulation arrangement and by deflection elements (6, 
7) mounted thereon, and constitutes a movable part of 

the horizontal region (3); 
that the connecting guide bars (10, 11) completing the 
parallelogram articulation arrangement are held on an 

incline in the base or working position by the operating 
element (18); 
and that the deflection elements (6, 7) of the lower 
guides (19', 20') are arranged in the region of the ends  

 
of the connecting guide bars (10, 11) connected to the 

lower guide bars (9). 
Bucket elevator according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the angle of inclination (α) of the connecting 

guide bars (10, 11) - calculated on the basis of an 
imaginary vertical axis (26) - in the base or working 

position of the bucket elevator (1) lies between 20° and 
40°. 
Bucket elevator according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the ratio of the length of the connecting guide 

bars (10, 11) to the length of the horizontal guide bars 
(8, 9) is smaller than 1. 
Bucket elevator according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the ratio of the length of the connecting guide 

bars (10, 11) to the length of the horizontal guide bars 
(8, 9) lies between 0.16 and 0.63. 
Bucket elevator according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the operating element is in the 

form of a hydraulic cylinder (18). 
Bucket elevator according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the hydraulic cylinder (18) is mounted in the 

region of the front connecting guide bar (10) facing 
away from the vertical region (2). 
Bucket elevator according to Claims 5 and 6, 
characterised in that the hydraulic cylinder (18) is 

essentially parallel to the horizontal guide bars (8, 
9).  

 
Bucket elevator according to Claims 6 and 7, 
characterised in that the hydraulic cylinder (18) acts 

on the front connecting guide bar (10) at approximately 
half its height (19). 
Bucket elevator according to Claims 5 to 8, 
characterised in that the hydraulic cylinder (18) may be 

initially stressed in such a manner that it will 
discharge in the case of an upwardly directed counter-force 

(F''), which corresponds to or is greater than the 
downwardly directed force (F
erf
). 
Bucket elevator according to Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that a tension station (23) is provided 

for the driving elements (5), provided in particular in 
the form of chains, in the region of the front 

deflection element or elements (6).
