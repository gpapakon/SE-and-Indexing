<ABSTRACT>
A retroviral vector particle resistant to inactivation by human serum. The vector particles preferably include p15E protein wherein at least a portion of the DNA encoding p15E protein is mutated such that the vector particle is resistant to inactivation by human serum. The vector particles may further include a protein containing a receptor binding region which binds to the receptor of a human target cell, thereby enabling the direct introduction of desired heterologous genes in vivo, whereby the vector particle including the heterologous gene travels directly to a targeted cell or tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
 VECTOR PARTICLES RESISTANT TO INACTIVATION BY HUMAN SERUMThis invention relates to "injectable" vect particles. More particularly, this invention relates vector particles, such as retroviral vector particle wherein such vector particles are resistant to inactivati by human serum.Vector particles are useful agents for introduci gene(s) or DNA (RNA) into a cell, such as a eukaryotic cel The gene(s) is controlled by an appropriate promote Examples of vectors which may be employed to generate vect particles include prokaryotic vectors, such as bacteri vectors; eukaryotic vectors, including fungal vectors su as yeast vectors; and viral vectors such as DNA vir vectors, RNA virus vectors, and retroviral vector Retroviruses which have been employed for generating vect particles for introducing genes or DNA (RNA) into a ce include Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus, Spleen Necros Virus, Rous Sarcoma Virus and Harvey Sarcoma Virus. T term "introducing" as used herein encompasses a variety methods of transfering genes or DNA (RNA) into a cell. Su methods include transformation, transduction, transfectio and infection.Vector particles have been used for introducing D (RNA) into cells for gene therapy purposes. In genera such a procedure involves obtaining cells from a patient a using a vector particle to introduce desired DNA (RNA) i the cells and then providing the patient with the engineer cells for a therapeutic purpose. It would be desirable provide alternative procedures for gene therapy. Such alternative procedure would involve genetically engineeri 

cells jLn vivo. In such a procedure, a vector particle whic includes the desired DNA (RNA) would be administered to patient for .in vivo delivery to the cells of a patient.It is therefore an object of the present invention t provide gene therapy by introduction of a vector particle such as, for example, a retroviral vector particle, into patient, wherein the vector particle is resistant t inactivation by human serum.In accordance with an aspect of the present invention there is provided a vector particle which is resistant t inactivation by human serum. Preferably, the vecto particle is a viral vector particle, and more preferably th viral vector particle is a retroviral vector particle.The envelope portion of retroviruses include a protei known as pl5E, and Applicants have found that retroviruse are susceptible to inactivation by human serum as a resul of the action of complement protein(s) present in serum o the pl5E protein portion of the retroviruε.
