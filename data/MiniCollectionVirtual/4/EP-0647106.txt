<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing a plastic mirror, especially as a component of a compact for cosmetic products, in which a plastic substrate with a bubble-free, plane, highly reflective surface is injection moulded in injection moulding tools, then coated by vapour deposition with a metal coating which is coated with a protective lacquer, the protective lacquer used being a u/v-dried protective lacquer. The injection moulding, vapour deposition, protective lacquering and drying processes are all performed in clean room conditions. Here, the particle concentration should preferably not exceed 1,000 particles per cubic metre. The substrate may be moved from the injection moulding tools via the individual processing stations by means of handling devices. The protective lacquer may be applied to the substrate in finely divided form. During this process the substrate may be rotated about an axis lying outside it.

<CLAIMS>
Process for producing a plastic mirror, especially as a 
component of a compact for cosmetic products, whereby a plastic base board 

is injection-moulded, after which a metal coating is applied to the base board 
via vacuum deposition and the metal coating is then provided with a 

transparent protective coating, characterised in that injection-moulding tools 
with a cavity-free, flat, high-lustre surface are employed, that UV-drying, 

water-white protective lacquer is applied to the vacuum-deposited metal 
coating, and that the injection-moulding, vacuum deposition, protective 

lacquering and drying processes take place continuously under clean-room 
conditions, with a maximum particle concentration of 1,000 particles per 

cubic metre. 
Process in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that the 
material employed for injection-moulding of the base board is conveyed from 

the tool passages to the mould cavity via gates which take the form of a film. 
Process in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the base board is moved through its individual 

processing stations by means of manipulators, starting from the injection-moulding 
tools. 
Process in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the protective lacquer is applied to the base board in 

finely atomised form. 
Process in accordance with claim 4, characterised in that the 
base board is rotated during application of the protective lacquer, whereby 

the rotational axis lies outside of the base board. 
Process in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that aluminium is deposited as the metal coating.  

 
Process in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the base board is injection-moulded in styrene-acrylic-nitrile 

(SAN) or polycarbonate (PC).
