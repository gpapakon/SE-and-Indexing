<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns epitopes of the HIV virus gp160
protein, that are immunologically homologous to epitopes of the
protein family of the human major histocompatibilty complex
HLA, to be used for diagnosing and immunization.Among the mechanisms thought to be responsible of
AIDS, it has been suggested that auto-immunity, namely auto-antibody
induction mechanism, may play a major role (Hebeshaw
J.A and Dalgleish A.G., J. Acquired Immun. Defic. Syndrome, 2,
457, 1989). The homology of portions of virus components with
endogenous proteins of the human body could reduce the self-tolerance
immunity mechanisms, thus causing the synthesis of
antibodies, and activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes.The gp120 protein is used to produce vaccines for
immunization of HIV infection, as a complex with the gp41
protein, such complex being defined as gp160 (ref.).The PCT Application No. W089/09618 claims anti-HIV
vaccines devoided of gp160 fragments generating HIV-1
infection enhancing antibodies. However, the cited application
does not disclose any gp160 epitope able to induce auto-antibodies
in HIV-infected subjects.The PCT Application No. WO92/05196 concerns
alloepitopes of HIV gp160 recognized by CD4+ T cell receptors,
having a three-dimensional structure (α-helix) similar to the
region of the human Major Hystocompatibiliy Complex (MHC).
However, also this cited application does not disclose any gp160
epitope able to induce auto-antibodies in HIV-infected subjects.The inventor previously isolated and described two
monoclonal antibodies, M38 and L31, which react with the HIV
virus gp160 protein as well as with the class I HLA protein
(Beretta et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 17, 1793-1798, 1987; Grassi
et al., J. Exp. Med., 174, 53-62, 1980). The gene coding said cell protein was idendified and
sequenced (Grassi et al., J. Exp. Med., 174, 53- 2562, 1980).Therefore it results obvious the need to identify
homology regions between HLA and HIV proteins, either for
diagnosis purpose in order to identify crossreactive antibodies in
the serum of either AIDS patients or HIV vaccinated subjects,
and to produce recombinant vaccines.In the context of this invention, "epitopes" mean
fractions of an antigen molecule that are recognized and/or are
able to bind a specific antibody; "immunologically homologous
epitopes" mean epitopes of at least two different antigen
molecules, that are recognized and/or are able to bind the same
antibody; "macromolecular structures" mean either cells, or parts
thereof, or proteins, or parts, thereof.The
