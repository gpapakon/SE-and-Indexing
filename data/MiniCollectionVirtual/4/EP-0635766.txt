<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus in which an electrostatic latent image is developed with liquid toner. 
The apparatus has a liquid extruder (48) that extrudes a thin film of liquid toner which is 

attracted to the electrostatic latent image forming a liquid image on a photoconductive 
surface (12). The extruder is electrically biased (66) to a suitable magnitude and polarity to 

ensure that the liquid toner is attracted to the latent image. A vacuum is applied (64) on the 
liquid toner as it is being attracted to the latent image so as to reduce the thickness of the layer 

coated thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an electrostatographic printing machine, and
more particularly concerns an apparatus for developing a latent image with liquid toner.In electrophotographic printing, a charged photoconductive member is exposed to a
light image of an original document. The irradiated areas of the photoconductive surface are
charged to record an electrostatic latent image thereon corresponding to the informational
area contained within the original document. Generally, the electrostatic latent image is
developed by bringing a developer mixture into contact therewith. A dry developer mixture
usually comprises carrier granules having toner particles adhering triboelectrically thereto.
Toner particles are attracted from the carrier granules to the latent image forming a toner
powder image thereon. Alternatively, a liquid developer material may be employed. The
liquid developer material includes a liquid carrier having toner particles dispersed therein. The
liquid developer material is advanced into contact with the electrostatic latent image and the
toner particles are deposited thereon in image configuration. After the toner particles have
been deposited on the photoconductive surface, they are transferred to a copy sheet.
Generally, when a liquid developer material is employed, the copy sheet is wet with both the
toner particles and the liquid carrier. Thus, it becomes necessary to remove the liquid carrier
from the copy sheet. This may be accomplished by drying the copy sheet prior to fusing the
toner particles thereto or relying upon the fusing process to permanently fuse the toner
particles to the copy sheet as well as vaporizing the liquid carrier adhering thereto.Liquid development is frequently carried out with a rotating developer roll
submerged or partially submerged in a liquid with a stationary electrode being employed to
create the necessary electrostatic field between the developer roller and the photoconductive
surface. In a system of this type, the full length of the photoconductive surface, including the
interdocument gap and the non-imaging areas, are always coated with liquid developer
material. This is wasteful of developer material and significantly increases the load placed
upon the cleaning system in the printing machine. Thus, it is desirable to reduce the quantity
of liquid developer material deposited on the photoconductive surface.US-A-4,851,317 discloses a toning station having a toner tank which holds liquid
toner. The toner tank is generally pyramidal and with
