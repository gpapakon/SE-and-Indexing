<ABSTRACT>
A medical device (20) for ligation or approximating tissue 
is disclosed. The device (20) has a cannula (21) with proximal (22) and 

distal (23) ends. The distal end (23) of the cannula (21) has a beveled 
surface (24), and the cannula (21) has first (33) and second (32) channels, 

the first channel (33) extending axially through it, and the 
second channel (32) extending from the beveled surface (24) to the 

first channel (33). The device (20) includes a suture (25) with a slide 
end (26) and a distal loop (27), as well as a slip knot (28) securing the 

loop (27) to the slide end (26). The slide end (26) is threaded thorough 
the first (33) and second (32) channels of the cannula (21) and it 

protrudes from the proximal end (22) of the cannula (21). In 
addition, the device (20) incorporates means (31) for securing the 

positioning of the slide end (26) of the suture (25) in the first 
channel (33) of the cannula (21). The device (20) may optionally have a 

frangible proximal end (22) wherein the proximal end (26A) of the 
suture (25) is mounted to the frangible proximal end (22). 
The device (20) is particularly well adapted for use 
during endoscopic surgery when it is necessary to perform 

operative procedures through small openings in the body. 
The device (20) is easy to maneuver and to position, and does 

not require the user to make the suture knot outside the 
body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a medical device,
particularly an endoscopic medical device, which is
designed to facilitate the surgical procedures of tissue
approximation and vessel ligation.As medical and hospital costs continue to increase,
surgeons are constantly striving to develop advanced
surgical techniques. Advances in the surgical field are
often related to the development of operative techniques
which involve less invasive surgical procedures and reduce
overall patient trauma. In this manner, the length of
hospital stays can be significantly reduced, and therefore
the hospital and medical costs can be reduced as well.One of the truly great advances in recent years to
reduce the invasiveness of surgical procedures is
endoscopic surgery. Endoscopic surgery involves the use
of an endoscope, which is an instrument permitting the
visual inspection and magnification of any cavity of the
body. The endoscope is inserted through a tube,
conventionally referred to as a cannula, after puncture
of a hole into the soft tissue protecting the body cavity.
The hole is made with a trocar, which is a sharp-pointed
instrument. The trocar includes an obturator, or cutting
implement, which is slideably and removably disposed 
within a trocar cannula. The obturator will puncture a
hole in the tissue equal in size to the inner diameter of
the trocar cannula. After puncture, the obturator can be
slideably withdrawn from the trocar cannula. The surgeon
can then perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures at
the surgical site with the aid of specialized
instrumentation designed to fit through the trocar cannula
and additional trocar cannulas providing openings into the
desired body cavity as may be required.In many surgical procedures, suturing and ligating
are required to close wounds. For example, suturing to
approximate tissue, which requires the formation of a
suture knot for placement of a stitch, is often required
for proper healing of lacerations and surgical incisions.
Additionally, ligating blood vessels to be cut within the
surgical site is often necessary in numerous surgical
procedures. The vessels may then be severed between the
ligations. The primary reason for ligating the vessels is
to maintain the surgical site free of an excess of blood
and to reduce blood loss in the patient.Conventionally, surgeons have closed blood vessels
with ligatures, which are long, relatively straight
strands of suture material. As is the case with the
formation of a suture knot to place a stitch, the surgeon
must manually tie
