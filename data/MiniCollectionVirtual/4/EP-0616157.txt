<ABSTRACT>
Fitting for the installation of a valve (5) and an accessory device (8) in a conduit for liquid or gaseous media, consisting of a metallic housing (1) which is designed with two coaxially aligned tubular stubs for the installation of the fitting in the conduit, with a third tubular stub (4), projecting transversely therefrom, for attachment of the valve (5) and with a connection flange (7), projecting perpendicularly to the plane defined by the axes of the three tubular stubs, for the releasable attachment of the accessory device (8). Provided in the connection flange (7) is a piece of tube (6) which at its end facing the accessory device (8), which end adjoins the inner tube (81) situated in the accessory device (8), has a circular cross-section and, at the opposite end, has an approximately semi-circular cross-section and which can be inserted into the connection flange (7) in two positions 180@ apart, the inner tube (81) of the accessory device (8) being connectable in one position of the piece of tube (6) to the first flow passage (22) coming from the first tubular stub (2) and connectable in the second position of the said piece of tube to the flow passage leading via the valve (5) to the second tubular stub.
