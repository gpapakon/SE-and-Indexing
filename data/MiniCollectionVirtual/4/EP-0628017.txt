<ABSTRACT>
This invention involves new compositions and methods of use and delivery of amorphous calcium compounds such as: amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), amorphous calcium phosphate fluoride (ACPF), amorphous calcium carbonate phosphate (ACCP), amorphous calcium carbonate phosphate fluoride (ACCPF), and amorphous calcium fluoride (ACF) for use in remineralizing and fluoridating teeth. These amorphous compounds or solutions which form the amorphous compounds, when applied either onto or into dental tissue prevent and/or repair dental weaknesses such as dental caries, exposed roots and dentin sensitivity. The compounds have the highest solubilities, fastest formation rates and fastest conversion rates (to apatite) among all the calcium phosphates under physiological conditions. Moreover, in the presence of fluoride the amorphous compound converts rapidly to fluoride containing apatite.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR MINERALIZING AND FLUORIDATING CALCIFIED TISSUESThe invention described herein was made in the course of research partially supported by a grant from the National Institute of Dental Research. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to certain amorphous calcium compounds that are unique in their applications as remineralizers of caries lesions, cavities and root erosions of the tooth. These amorphous compounds when further containing a fluoride compound can also be used for topical fluoridation of the teeth. When used for either fluoridation or mineralization these compounds prevent further tooth decay and actually restore the lesions caused by dental caries.2. Description of the Prior ArtWhen an incipient lesion or cavity develops on the surface of a tooth, the dentist traditionally fills the cavity that forms. This procedure may prevent the decay from spreading further, but does not restore the tooth to its original state. A considerable amount of research, however, has recently been directed toward the remineralization of dental lesions. The object of this remineralization has been the deposit of hydroxyapatite, CaÎ´(P04)OH, upon the surface of the tooth. Through this remineralization process further tooth decay is prevented and the tooth is restored to its original form.In the area of remineralization of dental tissue there have been at least three approaches. One approach uses a metastable fluoride containing calcium phosphate solution supersaturated with respect to fluorapatite and hydroxyapatite which will form apatite slowly when applied. (The term apatite, as used in the present patent, includes not only pure apatite, but also apatite that includes other elements such as fluoride containing apatite.) A second method uses combinations of sparingly soluble calcium phosphates with crystallized tetracalcium phosphate and at least one different calcium phosphate in slurries or paste form. Such an approach is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,612,053 issued to Brown et al. Yet a third method uses potassium oxalate solutions to obturate the dental tubules.These prior art methods are characterized by several practical problems. When a supersaturated solution using a single calcium phosphate is used, the 

remineralization process is extremely slow. The remineralization process is in fact so slow that an inconvenient amount of time is required for its completion. Another problem with the prior art methods is that as the apatite is deposited
