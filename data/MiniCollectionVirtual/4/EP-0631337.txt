<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrochemical cells comprising an ion exchange
resin membrane with juxtaposed electrodes and a solid polymer electrolyte composition
excellent in ionic conductivity and the effect of depressing crossover.As conventional solid polymer electrolyte, such cation exchange resin
as perfluorocarbon sulphonic acid, polysulphone, perfluorocarboxylic acid,
styrene-vinyl benzene sulphonic acid and such anion exchange resin as
styrene-butadiene based resin are known. Especially, the perfluorocarbon
sulphonic acid is fluorinated resin developed by Du Pont which is known as
Nafion (tradename). The Nafion which may function as solid polymer
electrolyte is attracting attention because of its excellent chemical
stability and thermal stability. The Nafion is basically a copolymer of
tetrafluoroethylene and perfluorovinylether having a sulphonic group.Among the above solid polymer electrolytes, the granular electrolyte
is packed in a column and employed for the manufacture of pure water and
the like. The solid polymer electrolyte molded to a thin film is employed
as an ion exchange membrane of various electrochemical cells. The solid polymer electrolyte electrochemical cell converts chemical
energy into electric energy. In case of a fuel cell, for example, such a
fuel as a hydrogen gas and methanol and such an oxidant as an oxygen gas
and hydrogen peroxide are supplied to an anode and a cathode,
respectively, and a current produced in an electron transfer reaction on
the anode or the cathode flows in the solid polymer electrolyte membrane
(ion exchange membrane). The flow of the current is produced by the
movement of a cation from the anode to the cathode and of a cation from
the cathode to the anode. The movement of the ions is said to occur by
the presence of water in a three-dimensional network layer formed by the
ion exchange groups. If, however, the solid polymer electrolyte
membrane is dried, the electric resistance of the membrane, in other
words, the specific resistance is increased to remarkably lower the
ionic conductivity. Since, accordingly, the specific resistance becomes
small with the wetting of the membrane, the lowering of the specific
resistance decreases the energy loss when a current flows in the solid
polymer electrolyte membrane to provide a solid polymer electrolyte
fuel cell with high performance. The solid polymer electrolyte
membrane sufficiently humidified can prevent the leakage of a hydrogen gas
supplied to the anode and an oxygen gas supplied to the cathode
