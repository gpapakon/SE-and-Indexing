Paving stone set for lawn paving, the paving 
stone set being made up of concrete paving stones (10), 

which are spaced apart, creating wide longitudinal gaps 
(16) and transverse gaps (17) suitable for plant growth, 

are joined together by a holding grid (11) and are 
secured against displacement, characterized in that 


a) the concrete paving stones (10) are joined together 
exclusively by the holding grid (11), 
b) the holding grid (11) consists of tension-resistant 
and non-perishable elastic material, 
c) the holding grid (11) lies continuously exposed in 
the region of the longitudinal gaps (16) and 

transverse gaps (17), 
d) the holding grid (11), exclusively in the region of 
the concrete paving stones (10), is fully embedded 

therein, 
e) the holding grid (11) is embedded in the concrete 
paving stones (10) at a distance from a bottom side 

(15) of these stones, which distance corresponds to 
one-quarter to one-third of the total height of a 

concrete paving stone (10), 
f) the distance between the longitudinal strands (12) 
and transverse strands (13) of the holding grid (11) 

is in each case from 2 cm to 5 cm, preferably around 
3 cm. 
Device for the manufacture of paving stone sets 
made up of concrete paving stones (10) which are spaced 

apart and are joined together by a holding grid (11), the 
device comprising a concrete mould having a flask (19) 

which exhibits die cavities (27) for a respective  
 

concrete paving stone (10) and rests on a base, in 
particular a moulding plate (28), characterized in that 


a) the flask (19) is divided along a partition plane 
(33) which extends at a distance from a bottom 

boundary of the die cavities (27) and runs approximately 
parallel to the base, 
b) the flask (19) comprises a top part-flask (34) and 
a bottom part-flask (35), 
c) the bottom part-flask (35) can be drawn, relative to 
the fixed, top part-flask (34), from the moulding 

plate (28) in the horizontal direction, 
d) the bottom part-flask (35) exhibits mould walls 
(transverse walls 26) extending exclusively in the 

direction of the drawing motion, and preferably a 
bottom part of a longitudinal spar (22), which 

bottom part is situated to the front in the 
direction of draw, transverse to the direction of 

draw. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the bottom part-flask (35) is configured as a 

drawing sheet (29) and can be moved by this out of and 
into the concrete mould. 
Device according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the flask (19) is configured such that the 

holding grid (11) can be clamped between the bottom part-flask 
(35) and the top part-flask (34), parts of the 

holding grid (11) being respectively clamped between the 
adjacent mould walls of the part-flasks (34, 35). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the holding grid (11) can be clamped on three sides 

between the bottom part-flask and the top part-flask, in 
particular between margin-sided end walls (longitudinal 

spars 22 and transverse spars 23, 24). 
Device according to one or more of Claims 2 to 5, 
characterized in that the top part-flask (34) exhibits, 

on the side situated to the rear in the direction of 
draw, a longitudinal spar (21), the height of which 

corresponds to that of the flask (19). 
Device according to one or more of Claims 2 to 6,  
 

characterized in that the holding grid, which consists of 
an elastic material, preferably synthetic material, can 

be drawn from a roller, preferably by the drawing sheet 
(29) which is movable to and fro, the drawing sheet (29) 

exhibiting projection-like holding members (39). 
Process for the manufacture of paving stone sets 
made up of concrete paving stones (10) which are spaced 

apart and are joined together by a holding grid (11) 
formed from longitudinal strands (12) and transverse 

strands (13), in particular in a device according to one 
or more of Claims 2 to 7, characterized in that 


a) a bottom part-flask (35) is arranged on a base, in 
particular a moulding plate (28), 
b) the holding grid (11) is subsequently arranged on 
the bottom part-flask (35), 
c) after this, a top part-flask (34) is arranged on the 
bottom part-flask (35) and the holding grid (11), 

the holding grid (11) being clamped between the top 
part-flask (34) and bottom part-flask (35), preferably 

from three sides, 
d) the concrete is subsequently filled into the flask 
(19), which is open at the top, the holding grid 

(11) being configured such that the fresh concrete 
filled into the concrete mould is able to pass 

through openings (18) formed by the longitudinal 
strands (12) and transverse strands (13), 
e) pressure rams (31) are then lowered into the flask 
(19) from above, the concrete being compacted, 
f) the bottom part-flask (35) is subsequently retracted 
horizontally relative to the fixed, top part-flask 

(34), 
g) the top part-flask (34) is then moved upwards, and 
h) the pressure rams (31) are subsequently raised.
