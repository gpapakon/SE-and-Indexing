<ABSTRACT>
A riser bundle comprising a number of risers (2) extending in a wave configuration from the bottom of a body of water up to a floating vessel or the like, the riser bundle (1) along its length being provided with means giving different portions (5, 6, 7) along the wave configuration different submerged weight and net buoyancy. The risers (2) are arranged around a centrally extending tube (3) and are surrounded by a tubular outer casing (4), the central tube (3) and the interspaces (8) between the risers (2), along different portions of the wave configuration in operation being filled with materials of different density. Thereby there is achieved at least one light portion (5) of the configuration having a desired positive net buoyancy, and a heavy portion (6 resp. 7) on each side of the light portion (5) having a desired positive submerged weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a riser arrangement comprising a
number of risers extending in a wave configuration from the
bottom of a body of water up to a floating vessel or the like,
the riser bundle along its length being provided with means.
giving different portions along the wave configuration different
submerged weight and net buoyancy.Risers extending between the sea bed and a vessel
floating on the surface will not be able to run in a straight
line because of the large vertical movements which the vessel has
in waves. The risers therefore must be arranged in some geometry
allowing the upper end to have large vertical and horizontal
movements. During a period of 10 - 15 seconds the upper end,
which is fastened to the vessel, will move approximately Â± 10 m
both vertically and horizontally. In addition, the upper end of
the riser during a longer time period will be able to move in the
horizontal plane within a circle having a radius of about 10 -
20% of the ocean depth.A typical geometry which is used to meet these requirements,
is an essentially S-shaped "wave" configuration, as shown
in Fig. 1 (wherein the S-shape indeed is shown reversed
and as described in Wo 97/06341. In
order to cause a riser to float in this manner in the water, it
is necessary to give different portions along the riser a
different submerged weight and net buoyancy. Along the upper
portion or ridge of the "wave" curve the riser will have a
positive net buoyancy. This may be achieved in that the riser has
a small weight or in that it is equipped with buoyancy bodies in
this region. Common practice today is to fasten buoyancy bodies
to the riser along this portion. When using several risers simultaneously,
these are usually arranged separately in the water,
so that each riser must be provided with respective separate
buoyancy bodies. This entails that the installation of such
risers will be a time-consuming and circumstantial process. In
addition, the separate external buoyancy bodies entail that the
risers will be subjected to larger wave forces, because of the
extra volume of the buoyancy bodies.It is an object of the invention to provide a riser
bundle which is without external buoyancy bodies, so that reduced 
wave forces are obtained, and which has a structure enabling an
economic and rational installation.Another object of the invention is to provide a riser
bundle enabling adjustment of the buoyancy/weight of the riser
s bundle while it is in operation.The above-mentioned objects are achieved with a riser
arrangement of
