<ABSTRACT>
Educational devices using process-oriented educational methods are disclosed to prepare pre-school children, school children, and teenagers for keyboarding. The devices include sets of gloves and indicia applied to the fingers of the gloves to provide pictorial and alphanumeric representations of the computer keyboard. The visual and tactile memorization of the glove images are complemented by auditory and associative memorization provided by a story-telling educational method. Synergistic use of the gloves in the context of supervised story-telling also trains the pre-school children to develop and practice both lateral and vertical thinking skills (21-32), thus preparing them for coping creatively with the inherent hardware/software limitations of computers. The memorization of the alphanumeric representation of the computer keyboard is reinforced through synergistic use of the gloves in a variety of activities including learning the alphabet, learning word-spelling, and learning languages. To best fit the psychology of teenagers, a set of picture-rings is disclosed to specifically prepare that age-group for keyboarding.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ADAPTIVE SYSTEM FOR TOUCH-TYPING/TRAININGBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionComputers are playing an ever more important role in the economical, scientific, and educational development of our society. It is therefore not uncommon to see curricula granting them a significant role in the educational process of young children.Children are most likely to fully utilize the resources that computers have to offer, as they become more comfortable in interacting with their physical interface, in particular the keyboard. Although computer interfacing has been greatly simplified through the standardization of the touch-typing keyboard, much is to be gained from educational systems that can help children to painlessly develop the needed keyboarding skills, as early as pre-school age.After acquiring keyboarding skills, children will need both lateral and vertical thinking to express their ideas as freely as possible with the computer while accommodating for its hardware/software limitations. Therefore, much is to be gained from wholistic educational systems that can motivate children, as early as pre-school age, to develop their lateral and vertical thinking skills, while preparing them for keyboarding.2. Analytical Description of the Relevant ArtSince the invention of the first typewriter, various means and devices have been proposed to teach/train students to type, or to type more efficiently, as exemplified by the following United States and Foreign Patents.U.S. Pat. No. 4.909.739 issued in 1990 to Ladner, et al, entitled "Interactive Typing/Training System" discloses a set of color-coded finger guides to be worn at the top of the hand, and indicating the character of the home key that each finger is to be used for in touch-typing. The color-coding of the keys of the keyboard match the color-coding of the finger guides to indicate to the typist which keys each fingerSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

should be used for.U.S. Pat. No. 2.570.908 issued in 1949 to Behr entitled "Indicator To Be Worn On The Hands While Learning To Typewrite" discloses a device constructed so as to be secured on the hand without impeding the use of the fingers in any way, and showing to the typist the correct keys of a type-writer to be struck by each finger, and the position of the keys relative to the actuating finger.In the aforementioned patents by Ladner and Behr, the key-finger assignment of the keyboard is indicated to the student-typist by means of devices which represent the keys by the letters and numbers they bear, as
