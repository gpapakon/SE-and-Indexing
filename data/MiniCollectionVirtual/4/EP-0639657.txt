<ABSTRACT>
A method of inhibiting the corrosion of an item, using a vapor phase 
corrosion inhibitor formulation comprising finely divided anhydrous amine 

molybdate having the structural formula: 

wherein either (i) R₁ is either a 2-ethylhexyl radical, or an aliphatic 
hydrocarbon having up to 7 carbon atoms, and wherein
 R₂ is either 
hydrogen or an aliphatic hydrocarbon having up to 7 carbon atoms, or (ii) 

R₁ and R₂ are 2-ethylhexyl radicals. The formulation has a vapor pressure 
which contributes to an ongoing availability of anti-corrosion protection. 

The formulation can be extruded with polyolefin films, and can be used 
in laminates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of inhibiting the corrosion of an 
item by using an anhydrous amine molybdate as a vapor phase corrosion 
inhibitor. In commerce and industry today, the useful life of corrodible items may 
be extended and/or preserved by providing corrosion inhibitors which 
protect the corrodible item from the adverse effects of its ambient 
environment. Corrosion inhibitors, particularly vapor phase corrosion 
inhibitors, have been found useful in protecting certain corrodible items 
against reaction with elements or compounds which may be found within 
their environment, and thereby losing their effectiveness, reducing their 
useful life, or otherwise diminishing their value. Such protection is 
typically needed during times of packaging, handling, shipment, or during 
end use. Elements or compounds which are normally of primary concern 
are gases such as oxygen, water vapor, sulfides, carbon dioxide, and the 
like. The formulations of the present invention find particular application 
in the preparation of packaging material, particularly through in-situ 
extrusion of the material with such films, with the films thereafter forming 
an envelope or other enclosure about the article being protected. These 
films may also be employed as a member of a multi-layer laminate 
including a metallized film having good tear resistant properties such as 
stress-oriented polyethylene terephthalate containing a vapor deposited film 
or layer of metallic aluminum. Such films are commercially available and 
are commonly designated as "aluminized" films. Among the common indications of corrosion manifested in useful metallic 
articles are oxidation, pitting, tarnishing, mottling, or discoloration of the 
surfaces of these items. These manifestations occur in the articles,  
 
particularly when exposed to oxygen and in either gaseous or liquid phase. 
Additionally, sulfides may present corrosion or tarnishing problems as 
well. Inasmuch as both oxygen and water, including water vapor, occur 
normally and are available in nature, it is normally necessary to take 
precautions against corrosion when packaging metallic items for shipment, 
or when subjecting such items to normal use. Metals which are frequently 
found to be susceptible to corrosion under normal atmospheric and 
ambient conditions are iron, steel, copper, brass, aluminum, silver, and 
alloys of these metals. Care must frequently be taken to protect articles 
fabricated from both ferrous and non-ferrous metals, eg. aluminium, 
coppe
