<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to silicon-substituted
fullerene compounds and methods of
making them.Fullerenes are a recently discovered form of
pure solid carbon. They are cage-like hollow
structures comprised of hexagon and pentagon rings
fused together to form ball shaped hollow molecules
which resemble geodesic domes. Fullerenes may range
from 32 carbons up to many hundreds of carbon atoms.
A fullerene molecule containing 60 carbons (C60) is
the archetype, and is known as Buckminsterfullerene.
For a general discussion of fullerenes, see R. Curl,
etal., Scientific American, 54 - 63 (Oct. 1991).Fullerenes have been synthesized by decomposing
graphite rods in the presence of helium. Graphite
rod decomposition may be accomplished by electric
arc, as discussed in A. Koch, etal., 56 Journal of
Organic Chemistry, 4543 - 4545 (1991)(C60; C70), or by
plasma discharge as discussed in D. Parker, etal.,
113 Journal American Chemical Society, 7499 - 7503
(1991)(C60 - C266). Researchers have identified many interesting
uses of fullerenes over the past few years. For
example, fullerenes show promise for use in diamond
films, non-linear optical and superconducting
materials, semi-conductors, and photo-conductors.
Because pure fullerenes form discreet crystals, more
processable forms of fullerenes are needed to more
fully exploit their unique properties.A few polymers of fullerenes have been
synthesized to help meet this need. In this regard,
D. Loy, etal. synthesized a C60-p-xylyene copolymer.
See, 114 Journal American Chemical Society, 3977 -
3978 (1992). Another example is a palladium polymer
of a Buckminsterfullerene synthesized by H.
Nagashima, etal., Journal of the Chemical Society,
"Chemical Communications", 377 - 379 (1992). Other
examples are the synthesis by S. Shi, etal. of a
polyester and polyurethane of diphenyl C61. (See,
114 Journal American Chemical Society, 10656 - 10657
(1992)) and a polymer-substituted fullerene shown in
E. Samulski, etal., 4 Chemical Materials, 1153 -
1157 (1992).A drawback of some of the foregoing substituted
fullerenes is that they employ expensive reagents,
like palladium and xylylene. Further, some are made
from reagents which have toxic side effects.
Accordingly, there is a need for an inexpensive and
non-toxic polymeric substituted fullerene. One aspect of the invention provides a compound
having the moiety Cn-A-Cm where Cn and Cm are ball-shaped,
n and m are numbers above 59 and below 267,
and A is a linker in which Si on the linker is
directly attached to both Cn and
