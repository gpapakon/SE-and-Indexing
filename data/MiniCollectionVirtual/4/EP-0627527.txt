<ABSTRACT>
This device comprises: a fixed casing (1) installed in the ground; a movable contrivance (5), housed in this casing, including, in the upper part, a plate supporting the street furniture element (4), this contrivance being able to move between a high position, in which this street furniture element emerges from the casing above the ground level, and a low position in which the street furniture element is retracted inside the casing so that its upper part does not extend beyond ground level; an electric gear motor (6, 7); and a transmission, in order to convert the rotational movement of the gear motor into a translational movement of the movable contrivance between its high position and its low position. According to the invention, the gear motor and the transmission form a reversible assembly such that, in the absence of power or of braking or locking applied to the outside of this assembly, the movable contrivance descends by itself, under gravity, back to its low position.

A device for supporting an item of retractable street furniture 
having electrical actuation, the device being of the type 

comprising: 

a stationary box (1) installed in the ground (2); 
moving equipment (5) housed in the box and including a top 
support plate for supporting the item of street furniture (4), 

said equipment being movable between a high position in 
which said item of street furniture emerges from the box 

above the level of the ground, and a low position in which 
the item of street furniture is retracted into the box so that 

the top portion thereof does not project above ground level; 
an electrical motor and gear box unit (6, 7); and 
a transmission for converting the rotary motion of the motor 
and gear box unit into translation motion of the moving 

equipment between its high position and its low position; 
 
characterized in that the motor and gear box unit and the 

transmission form a reversible assembly so that in the absence of 
power being fed to the motor and in the absence of braking or 

locking being applied from outside said assembly, the moving 
equipment moves back on its own to its low position under 

gravity. 
A device according to claim 1, in which the motor and gear 
box unit is carried by the moving equipment. 
An item of street furniture according to claim 1, in which the  
 

motor and gear box unit includes an electrically-controlled shaft 
brake (18) that is continuously activated after the equipment has 

reached its high position, and so long as an electrical power 
supply voltage for the device is available upstream therefrom. 
A device according to claim 2, in which the transmission 
comprises at least one deformable linear drive member (13, 13') 

such as a cable, a strap, a belt, or a roller chain co-operating 
with the outlet shaft (21) of the motor and gear box unit, and 

having at least one of its ends (15, 15') fixed to a high point 
of the box. 
A device according to claim 4, in which the other end of the 
deformable linear member is connected to a drum (12, 12') 

mounted at the outlet from the motor and gear box unit with the 
member being wound up on said drum. 
A device according to claim 4, in which the other end (19) 
of the deformable linear member is fixed to a low point of the 

box, the deformable linear member engaging with a drive wheel 
(12) mounted at the outlet of the motor and gear box unit. 
A device according to claim 1, in which the moving 
equipment is configured to form a bell (22) capable, in the event 

of the device being submerged, of enclosing a residual volume 
of air (23), the motor and gear box unit being mounted inside 

said bell at a level ensuring that it remains under all  
 

circumstances in said residual volume of air.
