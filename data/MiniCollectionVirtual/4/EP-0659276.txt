Competitive immunoassay for the detection of
collagen type I or collagen fragments thereof in a

sample, wherein a binding partner which contains a
synthetic linear peptide that corresponds to a

sequence of the non-helical C- or N-terminal region
of collagen type I


is incubated with an antibody that is capable of
binding the synthetic linear peptide,
and the sample
and the binding of the antibody to the binding
partner is determined in a suitable manner.
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the synthetic
linear peptide corresponds to a sequence of the

non-helical C-terminal region of collagen type I.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 and 2,
wherein the synthetic linear peptide is composed of

5 to 25 amino acids and preferably of 8 to 20 amino
acids.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3,
wherein the synthetic peptide corresponds to the

sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1, 2 or 3. 
Standard material for constructing a standard or
calibration curve in a competitive immunoassay for

the detection of collagen or collagen fragments of
type I, wherein it contains an antigen which

contains a synthetic linear peptide that
corresponds to a sequence of the non-helical C- or

N-terminal region of collagen type I.
Process for the production of the standard material
as claimed in claim 5, wherein a linear peptide

that corresponds to a sequence of the non-helical
C- or N-terminal region of collagen type I is

synthesized and coupled optionally via a spacer to
a suitable carrier molecule via its N- or C-terminal

amino acid.
Antigen for the production of antibodies against
collagen type I or collagen fragments, wherein it

contains a synthetic linear peptide that
corresponds to a sequence of the non-helical C- or

N-terminal region of collagen type I.
Antigen as claimed in claim 7, wherein the
synthetic linear peptide is coupled to a suitable

carrier protein.
Process for the production of the antigen as
claimed in claim 7, wherein a linear peptide that

corresponds to a sequence of the non-helical C- or
N-terminal region of collagen type I is synthesized

and coupled by means of its N- or C-terminal amino
acid to a carrier protein if desired via a spacer. 
Process for the production of antibodies against
collagen type I or collagen fragments, wherein an

antigen as claimed in claim 7 or 8 is used for the
immunization.
Antibodies against collagen type I or collagen
fragments thereof obtainable by immunization with

an antigen as claimed in claim 6 or 7 and isolation
of the desired antibody from the serum of the

immunized animals or by immortalizing the spleen
cells of the immunized animals, cloning those

immortalized spleen cells which produce the desired
antibody and isolating the antibody from the cloned

cells or from their culture supernatant.
Use of an antigen as claimed in one of the claims 7
or 8 in a method for the detection of type I

collagen or collagen fragments in a sample of a
body liquid as a measure for the extent of

osteolysis.
Use of an antibody as claimed in claim 11 in a
method for the detection of type I collagen or

collagen fragments in a sample of a body liquid as
a measure for the extent of osteolysis.
