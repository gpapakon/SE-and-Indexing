<ABSTRACT>
A laparoscopic surgical instrument which may be in the form 
of forceps or a cutter has, at the end of a hollow tube (10) 

for introduction through the body cavity wall, a housing 
(14A, 14B), a pair of pivotally mounted metallic jaws (12A, 

12B), a reciprocable control rod (18) in the tube (10), and 
an actuator (16) secured to the control rod (18). The 

actuator (16) has a pair of guide grooves (16GG) which are 
oppositely inclined with respect to a longitudinal axis of 

the instrument, and each jaw has a lug (12F) which fits in 
a respective groove (16GG), the lugs (12F) being spaced from 

the jaw pivots so that reciprocation of the control rod (18) 
causes opening and closing of the jaws (12A, 12B). The 

housing (14A, 14B) and the actuator (16) are electrically 
insulating and the jaw pivots are spaced apart to achieve 

electrical isolation of one jaw from the other, for applying 
a radio frequency voltage across the jaws (12A, 12B) for 

bipolar electrosurgery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a laparoscopic surgical instrument
having a pair of jaws which are pivotable with respect to
each other. The invention is particularly but not
exclusively applicable to an electrosurgical instrument with
jaws insulated from each other.A disposable laparoscopic instrument is disclosed in EP-A-0507622.
Mounted at the end of a tube for insertion into
the body cavity is a pair of jaws pivotable with respect to
each other about a common pivot axis in a scissor action.
The jaws are actuated by a push rod in the tube, the end of
the push rod being connected beyond the end of the tube by
a pair of links to proximally directed extensions of the
jaws so that reciprocation of the push rod causes pivoting
of the jaws.Being a laparoscopic instrument, this prior device is
designed to be introduced through a so-called "keyhole"
aperture or port placed in the wall of the body cavity using
a trocar. For minimal tissue damage such ports are made as
small as possible with typical port sizes being in the range
of from 5mm to 12.5mm and, as a result, the instrument
suffers from disadvantages arising out of the compact
construction necessary to allow the jaws and their actuating
mechanism to be passed through a narrow trocar, particularly
a limitation on the force which can be applied by the jaws
and distortion of the mechanism during use.The problems faced by the designer of a laparoscopic
instrument are compounded if electrosurgical energy is to be
applied. In open surgical procedures, bipolar
electrosurgery is most commonly used with forceps
applicators. As the tissue to be treated is in close
proximity to the hand of the operator, the forceps are
constructed as long arms insulated and hinged at the rear. Each arm of the forceps is connected to the active and
return output lines of an the electrosurgery radio frequency
(RF) generator. In this fashion, all tissue within the
grasp of the forceps may be desiccated. The most useful
application of bipolar forceps is in stemming blood flow
from cut vessels. They are particularly useful in this
application because the blood vessel may be closed by
applying closure pressure to the forceps before activating
the RF output. During activation, the inner walls of the
vessel become tacky and therefore stick together whilst the
blood within the vessel forms a coagulum. Thus blood loss
from severed blood vessels may be quickly staunched.The delivery of electrosurgical energy by a laparoscopic
instrument is of particular advantage when parting or
dissecting
