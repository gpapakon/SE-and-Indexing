<DESCRIPTION>
 Combined action of endoσlucanases and cellobiohvdrolasesTechnical fieldThe present invention is in the field of cell wall degradation. The present invention discloses the use of combinations of enzymes in the degradation of plant cell walls. The advantage of the use of xyloglucanase activity is disclosed. Specific optimized ratios of cell wall degrading enzymes are also disclosed. Specifically, the combined action of endoglucanases and cellobiohvdrolases in the degradation of a xyloglucan/cellulose complex is disclosed.Furthermore it is demonstrated that these enzymes have a synergistic effect.Background of the inventionIn the study of enzymatic plant cell wall degradation two structural components of plant cell walls have been widely investigated, these are cellulose and pectin.Apart from cellulose and pectic substances, a third structural element of the cell wall should be mentioned: the xyloglucans (Hayashi et al. (1984) Plant Physiol. 5 '• 605-610, Hayashi T. (1989) Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 40. : 139-168) . Xyloglucans consist of a cellulosic backbone about 70% of the glucose residues of this backbone are substituted with side chains. These side chains primarily contain xylose, galactose and fucose. Further, they hydrogen bond tightly to cellulose (Hayashi et al. Plant Physiol. 8_3 : 384-389, Talbott L.D. and P.M.Ray (1992) Plant Physiol. 98. : 357-368) and are also bound to other cell wall components (Fry S.C. and J.G.SUBSTITUTE SHEET {RULE 26) 

Miller (1989) . Toward a working model of the growing plant cell wall : phenolic cross-linking reactions in the primary cell walls of dicotyledons. In : Lewis N.G. , Paice M.G. Eds. The biosynthesis and biodegradation of plant cell wall polymers, ACS, Washington* DC, pp 33-46 and Talbott L.D. and P.M.Ray (1992) , cited above) .Although they are present in relatively large amounts(about 20% in dicots according to T. Hayashi (1989, cited above) no attention has been paid to xyloglucans with respect to the enzymatic liquefaction process of plant material(Voragen et al. (1992) Flύss. Obst.59 404-410). The activities screened for during the purification of glucanases are CMCase(often referred to as Cx or endoglucanase) , Avicelase (often referred to as C,, cellobiohydrolase or exoglucanase) and sometimes cellobiase or β-glucosidase. Xyloglucanase (XGase) activity is generally not included. This means that to date no systematic use has been made of xyloglucanase activity in cell wall degradation.Relatively little is known about the xyloglucans
