<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for building a road bed (96) and the use of the same. Shotcreting is used to provide a road bed (96) with one or a plurality of vaulted concrete casings (6) with respective vaulted cavities (92) remaining thereinside. This can be assisted by using a mesh or a profiled shaped plate set in a vaulted shape, and shotcreting is effected onto the surface of said mesh or profiled shaped plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD FOR BUILDING A ROAD BED AND THE USE OF THE SAMEThe present invention relates to a method as set forth in claim 1 for building a road bed.Our earlier Patent application FI 894535 discloses a method for producing a joint structure as a combination of a shaped plate, generally a profiled steel plate, and concrete by shotcreting the shaped plate. An expanded sheet metal mesh manufactured from thin steel sheet by elongation is prior known from US Patents 1 864 598 and 3 034 197. A wider- meshed diagonal screen grid manufactured from thicker sheet metal by cutting' and elongation is known e.g. from US Patent 3 570 086.Α drawback in the current road-building methods is e.g. that a road bed requires heavy soil masses, which often lead to undesired depressions in soft ground underneath. The elimination of those requires expensive ground reinforce¬ ments. Indeed, the construction on soft basic grounds generally incurs major extra costs.Building passages in road-bed structures by the application of the prior known methods is expensive and inconvenient. Particularly, the casting of concrete into an arched vaulted shape is difficult and tedious. Carrying great masses of soil to a road-construction site requires a lot of time and causes environmental problems. The soil materials suitable for road-building are nearly exhausted in many places and must often be excavated in areas valuable in terms of environmental protection. Carrying out the construction on soft grounds may take several years as the reinforcement of subsoil is a tedious procedure. The road surfaces do not often remain flat but the roads develop traffic-disturbing depressions. 

At present, road beds are in useless form as some sort of soil storages. In downtown areas, for example, the street sections are highly valuable areas. Those should be in service more useful than e.g. the storage of sand.An object of this invention is to alleviate the above drawbacks and that is achieved by means of a method of the invention by the application of shotcreting to provide a road bed with one or a plurality of vaulted cavities inside a concrete casing.The invention can be used in a great number of applications. The accompanying figures are only intended to serve as examples and to illustrate the way of carrying out the invention.In this specification, the term "roadway" refers to highways, walking paths, railroads, and streets as well as like passages.The term "vaulted" refers in specification to arched vaults, vaulted shapes consisting of arched and

Claims
1. A method for building a road bed (96), c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that shotcreting (4) is used to provide a road bed (96) with one or a plurality of vaulted cavities (92) inside a concrete casing (6).
2. A method as set forth in claim 1, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i z e d in that a mesh (10) or a profiled shaped plate (1) is set in a vaulted form and shotcreting is effected onto the surface of mesh (10) or profiled shaped plate (1).
3. A method as set forth in claim 1 or 2, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that said mesh (10) comprises a socalled expanded sheet metal mesh, made of thin metal sheet and pro¬ vided with reinforcement corrugations (49).
4. A method as set forth in any of claims 1 - 3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said mesh (10) or profiled shaped plate (1) used as a concreting foundation is bent by prefabriσation into a vaulted shape.
5. A method as set forth in any of claims 1 - 4, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said mesh (10) or profiled shaped plate (1) used as a concreting foundation is reinforced by means of a trussed bracing (86).
6. A method as set forth in any of claims 1 - 5, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that behind said mesh (10) is placed a concreting backing (27).
7. A method as set forth in any of claims 1 - 6, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said mesh (10) or profiled shaped plate (1) used as a concreting foundation is made substantially impervious to concrete. 


 8. A method as set forth in any of claims 1 - 7, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said vaulted cavity (92) is shotcreted both on the outside and on the inside.
9. A method as set forth in any of claims 1 - 8, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said casing structure (6) is provided with one or a plurality of reinforcement braces (100).
10. A method as set forth in any of claims 1 - 9, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that said casing structure (6) is made at least partially corrugated.
11. A method as set forth in any of claims 1 - 10, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that two or more vaulted cavities (92) are provided side by side for setting the horizontal stresses of concrete casings (6) at least partially to oppose each other.
12. The use of a road bed manufactured by the application of a method as set forth in any of claims 1 - 11, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the road bed is used as a traffic tunnel; a parking lot; a service passage; a cable canal; a public shelter, a storage; a water passage or a bridge.
