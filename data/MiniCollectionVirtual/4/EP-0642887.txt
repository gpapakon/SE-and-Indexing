surgical needles 12 having at least one abrading device and a 

needle holding mechanism. The abrading device includes an 
abrasive member such as a rotatable abrasive belt 30 or 

grinding wheel. The needle holding mechanism 44 is 
positionable for selectively engaging an end of at least one 

needle 12 with the abrading device to provide a cutting edge 
on the needle. A grinding wheel may be provided for hollow 

grinding the surgical needles, the grinding wheel including a 
cylindrical member having a plurality of ridges. The 

cylindrical member preferably has a super-abrasive coating of

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices for, and
method of, grinding surgical needles, and more particularly to
devices, including grinding wheels, for abrading the needle to
provide a surgical cutting edge on the needle through the use
of an abrasive surface for grinding and/or polishing a needle,
or a multiplicity of needles, simultaneously. The present
invention relates more particularly to an apparatus and a
method for producing hollow ground surgical needles.Surgical needle manufacture is a precise and time
consuming procedure, particularly where individual needles are
formed one at a time. Conventional surgical needle
manufacturing typically begins with the step of cutting round
wire stock to a predetermined length to form a needle blank.
One end of the blank is then tapered to provide a point
thereon. In some instances, such as for example in plastic
surgery needles or taper cutting edge needles, a cutting edge
must be formed at or near the point of the needle. To provide
a cutting edge, the tapered end of the needle is stamped or
pressed and then subjected to grinding and/or polishing to
sharpen its longitudinal edges. Normally, at least a portion
of the needle blank is pressed to provide flat surfaces on a
portion of the needle to facilitate grinding. After the 
cutting edge is formed on the needle, the needle blank is cut
to its final desired length and then prepared for suture
attachment. The needle may be further subjected to additional
steps such as polishing or hardening.Conventional needle processing is in large part a
manual operation. Providing a cutting edge, for example,
typically includes the steps of: grasping and holding a
needle using a hand held device; manually moving the needle
into contact with a rotating abrasive belt or grinding wheel;
visually evaluating and/or confirming the progress of needle
cutting edge formation; and repeating the steps of manually
contacting the needle with the abrasive surface and visually
checking the progress of the cutting edge formation for each
edge to be applied to the needle. Since visual confirmation
of a specified cutting edge in the view of the person
performing the operation is required, the reproducibility,
accuracy and hence quality of the cutting edge is largely a
function of the skill and experience of the operator.More specifically, in the prior art the needle may
be held by a pliers-like device or a chuck which grips an end
of the needle opposite from the end of the needle where the
cutting edge is to be applied. Usually, no more

Am apparatus for hollow grinding a plurality of surgical needle blanks, which apparatus
comprises:


a substantially cylindrical member (88) rotationally mounted for abrading at
least two needle blanks, said substantially cylindrical member having a plurality of

circumferential needle grinding ridges (96) perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of
said cylindrical member, and each ridge having an abrasive surface for grinding

a needle blank to form a concave surface in the needle blank;
a support frame (114) for holding a plurality of said needle blanks in side by
side spaced apart relation, each blank being supported so as to contact a respective

one of the apexes of the ridges (96) while the cylindrical member rotates; and
means for positioning said holding frame (114) in relation to said abrading
member (88) to selectively engage and disengage the needle blanks with said

abrading member, wherein said positioning means is operable to move said holding
frame in at least two directions during said selective engagement with said

abrading member (88).
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said positioning means includes
means for moving said holding frame (114) along an axis perpendicular to both a

longitudinal axis of the needle blank and a longitudinal axis of said abrading
member.
The apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said positioning means includes
means for altering the depth of the abrasion relative to the longitudinal axis of the

needle blanks.
The apparatus according to claim 3, wherein said depth altering means includes a
movable plate oriented at an angle relative to the longitudinal axis of the needle

blanks such that the position of the longitudinal axis of the needle blank relative to
said abrading member is alterable as the needle blanks are moved into and out of

engagement with said abrading member. 
The apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said plate is oriented at an angle of
approximately 5 degrees to 30 degrees relative to said longitudinal axis of the
