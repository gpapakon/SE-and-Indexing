<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to ensure even close tolerances for the maintenance of the test pressure, uniformly long control pulses are not used for the solenoid valves (MV1), but rather, after the first determination of a pressure deviation, a first control pulse (MV1OUT) having a prescribed initial duration is triggered for the solenoid valve (MV1) to be controlled, and in the case of each pressure deviation subsequently measured at periodic intervals, a further control pulse becomes effective, the pulse duration of each subsequent control pulse being lengthened by a prescribed time duration with respect to the respective preceding pulse. Generation of the sequences of control pulses by separate solenoid valve control units, irrespective of the commands of a superordinate control unit in the case of undershooting and overshooting of a prescribed switching threshold PU1 and PO1, respectively.

Method for regulating pressure by means of 
solenoid valves (MV...) on pressurized devices, for 

example for pressure testing in the case of plastic 
tubes, by periodically measuring the pressure on a test 

specimen (P) and, in the event of deviations from the 
respectively prescribed set point (P
SOLL
), raising or 
lowering the pressure by using a control pulse to open 

the corresponding solenoid valve (MV1 or MV3) after 
detecting an impermissible pressure deviation for the 

first time, characterized in that, starting from the 
respective first control pulse with a prescribed 

duration, the period of each subsequent control pulse 
is lengthened by a prescribed period by comparison with 

the respective previous pulse, so that the pressure 
regulation can be dosed in a simple way independently 

of the different operating times of the solenoid valves 
(MV...) caused by the respective pressure difference 

between the inlet and outlet of the solenoid valves. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that for the purpose of generating the control pulse 

trains for regulating pressure by means of the solenoid 
valves (MV...) use is made of those upstream separate 

solenoid valve control units (MVST) which are started 
by a higher-level controller (PROZ,STE) given a 

determined impermissible pressure deviation, and are 
reset again after elimination of the impermissible 

pressure deviation.  
 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that given an impermissible pressure deviation 

overshooting to a prescribed extent, the higher-level 
controller (PROZ,STE) causes the solenoid valve control 

unit (MVST) to output a continuous pulse which lasts 
until the prescribed extent of the impermissible 

pressure deviation is undershot again, and in that the 
solenoid valve control units (MVST) are subsequently 

switched to generating the control pulse train until 
the impermissible pressure deviation is eliminated. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that coarse regulation is carried out in accordance 

with the continuous pulse operation when the measured 
pressure values (P
M
) are below a pressure value (P
U2
), 
by comparison with the set point (P
SOLL
), as the first 
lower operating point, or above a pressure value (P
O2
), 
larger by comparison with the set point (P
SOLL
), as the 
first upper operating point, and in that fine 

regulation corresponding to the pulse train operation 
is carried o
ut when the measured pressure values (P
M
) 
are above the first lower operating point (P
U2
) but 
below a pressure value (P
U1
), situated between the 
latter and the set point (P
SOLL
), as second lower 
operating point, or below the first upper operating 

point (P
O2
) but above a pressure value (P
O1
), situated 
between the latter and the set point (P
SOLL
), as second 
upper operating point, the respective pressure values 

(P
O1
, P
O2
, P
O1
, P
O2
) for the operating points are fixed as 
a function of the set point (P
SOLL
) respectively to be 
observed and the prescribed tolerance limits in 

conjunction with the time values for the pulses of the 
control pulse train controlling the solenoid valves 

(MV1 or MV3, respectively) such that pressure changes 
caused by the control pulses do not lead to 

overshooting of the tolerance limits. 
Method according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that a common solenoid valve control 

unit (MVST) is used for the solenoid valves (MV1 and 
MV3, respectively) required for raising pressure and  

 
lowering pressure, and in that the solenoid valve (MV1 

or MV3) respectively to be actuated is characterized in 
each case by an individual control signal (MV1
IN
 and 
MV3
IN
, respectively), while a further control signal 
(TEA) indicates the continuous pulse operation or the 

pulse train operation. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5 for 
test installations with a plurality of test stations 

(ST) and a central processor controller (PROZ) which is 
coupled via a processor wiring system (ST-BUS) to the 

control devices (STE) of the individual test stations 
(ST...) as input/output units, characterized in that 

the control devices (STE) of the individual test 
stations (ST...) are driven cyclically one after 

another at equal time intervals by the processor 
controller (PROZ) and the respectively measured 

pressure values (P
M
) are transmitted to the processor 
control (PROZ), and in that subsequently the 

respectively transmitted pressure value (P
M
) is compared 
with the prescribed test pressure (P
SOLL
) and, depending 
on the extent of the pressure deviation determined in 

this case, the corresponding control commands are 
passed to the competent control unit (STE) and are 

converted by the latter into the control signals (MV1
IN
 
or MV3
IN
, and TEA) for the solenoid valve control unit 
(MUST) controlling the solenoid valves (MV1 and MV3, 

respectively). 
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the solenoid valve control units (MVST) at the 

individual test stations (ST...) react immediately only 
to the starting and switch-off signals for the 

continuous pulse operation and the pulse train 
operation, and in that, by contrast, the pause between 

the control pulses in the case of the pulse train 
operation can be selected to be greater than the 

duration between two sequential pressure measurements. 
Control circuit (MVST) for regulating pressure 
by means of solenoid valves (MV...) on pressurized 

devices (P), for example for pressure testing in the  
 

case of plastic tubes, the control circuit having a 
pulse generator which, upon determination of a 

deviation of the pressure measured at the pressurized 
devices (P) from the respectively prescribed set point 

(P
SOLL
), supplies control pulses for opening respectively 
one of two solenoid valves (for example MV1 or MV3), in 

order either to raise or else lower the pressure, 
characterized in that the control circuit (MVST) has 

switching devices which, starting from the respective 
first control pulse of prescribed duration, in each 

case after the control circuit becomes effective 
outputs further control pulses with a duration 

lengthened by a prescribed period by comparison with 
the respectively preceding control pulse, until the 

pressure deviation is eliminated.

a down counter (RZ) which is reset for each 
control pulse emitted by the pulse stage (KS1, KS2), is 

subsequently loaded with the counter content of the 
pulse counter (IZ) and is reset in steps by subsequent 

clock pulses (CL), and 
a feedback branch (RKZ1) for resetting the pulse 
stage (KS1, KS2), which becomes active when the zero 

setting of the down counter (RZ) is reached. 
Control circuit according to Claim 9, 
characterized 


by a pause counter (PZ) which is coupled to the 
pulse stage (KS1, KS2) and can be released at the end 

of a control pulse generated by the pulse stage (KS1, 
KS2) in order to count a prescribed number of clock 

pulses (CL), and  
 
by a feedback branch (RKZ2), which becomes active 
when the prescribed number (for example 128) of clock 

pulses (CL) is reached, for releasing the pulse stage 
(KS1, KS2) for generating a possibly required further 

control pulse. 
Control circuit according to Claim 9 or 10,

inverted control signal (TEA) for the pulse train 
operation in parallel at its input, and in that the 

output of the OR element (OR2) is connected to in each 
case one control input or two downstream AND elements
