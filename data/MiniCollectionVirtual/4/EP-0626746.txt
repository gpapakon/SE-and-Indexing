<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a method for control of the rapid charging of sealed nickel storage cells of the nickel-hydride and nickel-cadmium type, possibly combined in a battery, the said storage cells having been identified, characterised in that it includes the following steps:   - a law of heating of the said storage cells depending on the charging time for a given charge mode is determined and stored in memory,   - the temperature of the said storage cells is measured, - a reference temperature is calculated as a function of the charging time already elapsed according to the said heating law, - the charging of the said storage cells is stopped when the difference between the said temperature of the storage cells and the said reference temperature is higher than a predetermined value.

A method of monitoring rapid charging of sealed nickel storage
cells of the nickel-hydride type and of the nickel-cadmium type, said

cells optionally being associated in a battery, and said cells being
identified, the method including the following steps in order to

determine the end of charging:

a relationship for the heating of said cells as a function of
charging time before the overcharging stage for a given charging mode

is determined and stored;
the temperature of said cells is measured;
a reference temperature is calculated on the basis of said
heating relationship and as a function of the charging time that has

already elapsed; and
the charging of said cells is stopped when the difference
between said temperature of said cells and said reference temperature

exceeds a predetermined value.
A method according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that said
heating relationship is determined as follows:


the change in the temperature of said cells during a charging
operation is measured and recorded;
a mathematical expression is established giving temperature as
a function of charging time; and
the heating relationship for said cells during said charging
operation is stored.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized by the fact that
prior to the beginning of charging it further includes a step

consisting in verifying temperature stability of said cells, with
charging being inhibited so long as the difference between a measured

temperature and a stored earlier measured temperature is greater than
a predetermined threshold value.
A method according to any preceding claim, characterized by the
fact that a reference temperature satisfying said stored heating

relationship is calculated for nickel-hydride type cells only, the 
temperature at the beginning of charging being taken as the reference

temperature for nickel-cadmium type cells.
A method according to any preceding claim, characterized by the
fact that the type of said cells is identified by comparing the

change in temperature as measured at the beginning of charging with a
predetermined relationship for temperature increase at the beginning

of charging.
A charger using the method according to any preceding claim,
including an electricity power supply system (20, 24, 25), a

temperature sensor (28) allowing the temperature of said storage
cells to be measured, means (29) for converting temperature

variations into voltage variations, a clock (31) allowing the
charging time that has elapsed to be measured, means (32, 33) for

storing said heating relationship, and a microprocessor (27) which
calculates, from said heating relationship, said reference

temperature as a function of the charging time that has already
elapsed, and said difference relative to the temperature of said

cells, and stops charging when said difference exceeds said
predetermined value.
