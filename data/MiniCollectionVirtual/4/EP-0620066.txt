<ABSTRACT>
In the process for cooling the cutting zone of a material being machined, a gaseous lubricant and coolant processed in an ionisator in the area of a corona discharge is fed at a speed which is not less than the cutting speed, and a controllable, stabilized electric current is used to excite the corona discharge, the intensity of which current is changed in accordance with the change in the feed speed of the gaseous lubricant and coolant. The device for carrying out this method contains an ionisator (1) having a housing (7) communicating with the feed source (3) of the gaseous lubricant and coolant by means of a line (9) and having an outlet nozzle (8), a spray electrode (2) accommodated in the housing (7), and a power-supply source (4) conductively connected to the spray electrode. This device has a controller (5), connected in the line (9) for feeding the gaseous lubricant and coolant, and a controllable stabilizer (6), lying in the power-supply circuit of the spray electrode (2), for the intensity of the output current.
