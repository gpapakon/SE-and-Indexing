venturi-type for gas fueled engines comprising a bleed air 

circuit including a bleed air control valve for adjusting the 
air fuel ratio k supplied to the engine. A memory means is 

provided for storing the aperture of the bleed air control 
valve corresponding to a prescribed air fuel ratio and a 

control unit is provided for controlling the bleed air control 
valve in response to the aperture. Moreover, an auxiliary air 

passage with an auxiliary air control valve disposed therein is 
provided in parallel with said bleed air control valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a charge forming device of the
venturi-type for gas fuelled engines
as defined in the
preamble portion of claim 1.One type of charge forming device used in gas fuelled engines
employs a variable venturi-type mixer positioned at the
junction of the fuel passage connection to the air intake
passage. In addition to having a bleed air passage connected
to the aforementioned gas fuel passage, there is also a
bleed air control valve which can variably control the cross
section of the bleed air passage. This type of device
controls the aperture of the bleed air control valve so that
λ = 1 for the oxygen concentration in the exhaust gases. The
above mentioned "λ" is defined as the actual air/fuel ratio
(F) divided by the theoretical air/fuel ratio (Fc); thus, λ
= 1 holds normally no matter what the type or composition of
gas fuel used, when the mixture is in a stoichiometric
state.The aperture of the aforementioned bleed air control valve is
generally controlled using a step motor. In such a case, the
aperture of the bleed air control valve is set to predetermined
aperture standards for λ = 1; in other words, the main jet
orifice of the mixer and the position of the metering rod
(needle valve) are designed, and the dimensions are selected in
such a manner that the step motor steps through a preset number
of steps to the standard step level. When the number of steps
is moved past the above mentioned standard step number (larger
aperture), or when is it moved to a value less than that
standard (smaller aperture), the air/fuel mixture is changed to
be leaner and richer, respectively. Production variations do occur during the fabrication of the
main jets, needle valves and the like in manufacturing the
aforementioned charge forming devices, and their tolerances
also change with age. Thus, there are cases where the actual
step number will be different from the predetermined step
number to maintain λ = 1. The problem is that when such
discrepancies arise, the adjustment range for the aperture of
the bleed air control valve, and by extension, the adjustment
range for the air/fuel mixture ratio, may be too narrow to make
the required compensation. For example, if the step number is
greater than the standard step number for λ = 1, then the
latitude by which the air/fuel mixture can be changed to the
lean side narrows. This results in limiting the range through
which air/fuel mixture can be varied.A further developed possibility of controlling the aperture of
the bleed air control valve is a
