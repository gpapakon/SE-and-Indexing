<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an acid catalyzed thermal polycondensation process 
for producing amino acid polymers. More specifically, amino acid polymers are produced by 

thermally condensing a mixture of one or more amino acids and optionally one or more 
polyfunctional monomers, using an acid catalyst, while maintaining an intimate admixture. 

Processing techniques useful for maintaining an intimate admixture include adding to the 
mixture one or more processing aids, using mechanical means, and combinations thereof. 

The amino acid polymers produced by this process are useful as cleaning and detergent 
additives; fertilizer and pesticide additives; personal care product additives; dispersants for 

inorganic particulates, aqueous emulsions, and drilling muds; and water treatment and oil 
production operation additives as corrosion and scale inhibitors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing amino acid polymers by
thermally condensing a reaction mixture of
one or more amino acids using one or more acid
catalysts.Poly(amino acids) such as poly(aspartic acid) are useful as cleaning and detergent
additives; fertilizer and pesticide additives; personal care product additives; dispersants; and
water treatment application and oil production operation additives. For example, EP
454126A discloses the use of poly(amino acids) as builders in detergent formulations.Poly(amino acids) have been synthesized by several different known methods. One
known method for synthesizing poly(amino acids) consists of first forming
poly(anhydroamino acid) by thermally condensing amino acids and then hydrolyzing the
resulting poly(anhydroamino acid) to form poly(amino acid) as disclosed in US 5,057,597.
However, poly(aspartic acid) produced by the process of US 5,057,597 is limited to a molecular
weight less than 5,000 as measured by aqueous gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
relative to a standard of 4500 molecular weight poly(acrylic acid).Another thermal polycondensation reaction of amino acids is disclosed by Fox, et al.,
in a publication entitled "Thermal Polycondensation of Alpha-Amino Acids," Analytical
Methods of Protein Chemistry, pp. 127-154, Permagon Press, Oxford 1966. Fox discloses a
process where phosphoric acid, orthophosphoric acid, or polyphosphoric acid, used as a
catalyst, is heated with one or more amino acids at 70°C to about 210°C to form
poly(anhydroamino acid). Fox et al., reports that the phosphoric acid catalyst increases the
reaction yield and molecular weight of the poly(anhydroamino acid).There are several problems associated with the above mentioned processes for making
poly(anhydroamino acid). The process to make poly(anhydroamino acid) using phosphoric
acid and one or more amino acids presents difficult processing problems because the mixture
of phosphoric acid and amino acid becomes a viscous molten paste upon heating. At the
completion of the reaction, the solid product formed may consist of hard, large chunks of
solid product, which may be nonuniform in composition. For example the inner part of the
hard, large chunks may contain unreacted amino acid due to less heat being transferred to
the inner part. Additionally, the solid product may be caked to the walls of the reaction
vessel. Because of these processing difficulties, the resulting solid product may need to be
dissolved in solvent or pulverized to recover the
