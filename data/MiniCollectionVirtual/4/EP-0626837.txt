<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent disposable 
article, such as a sanitary napkin, a panty protector, a 
diaper or an incontinence guard. Such articles are normally flat, i.e. have a two-dimensional 
shape, and are manufactured from flexible 
material. Although the flat shape of such articles is 
convenient from the technical aspect of manufacture, a 
flat article cannot readily be caused to conform to the 
shape of the wearer's anatomy. Because a poorly-fitting 
article will, in many cases, give rise to leakage and 
subsequent discolouring of the wearer's underclothes, 
various attempts have been made to produce articles of 
the aforesaid kind which will adapt better to the shape 
of the wearer's anatomy. For instance, the flat articles 
have been provided in manufacture with pre-stretched 
elastic which, when contracting, forces the two-dimensional 
article to take a three-dimensional shape. 
One advantage with this solution is that the articles can 
be packed in a flat state, although the provision of 
elastication results in more complicated and expensive 
manufacture. Another solution for providing a three-dimensional shape 
in sanitary napkins or like articles is to 
impart the desired shape to the sanitary napkin during 
the manufacturing process. An example of this solution is 
given in EP-A2-0302523. One drawback with this solution 
is that articles which are three-dimensional from the 
beginning are relatively expensive to manufacture and, 
consequently, the purchase price of such articles is 
relatively high. US-A-3,884,234 discloses a diaper with a fold line and a 
pocket formed thereby in the rear portion.  
 The object of the present invention is to provide an 
absorbent disposable article which has a flat packaging 
state and a three-dimensional state of use and which in 
its state of use will conform effectively with the shape 
of the wearer's body. This object is achieved in accordance with the invention 
with an absorbent disposable article of the aforesaid 
kind which is characterized in that the article 
comprises at least two generally flat, flexible 
bodies which include absorbent material and which in a 
packaging state can lie against one another with first flat 
sides which are intended to face towards the wearer when the 
article is in use; in that two neighbouring 
bodies of the article are mutually joined along a first 
common edge which forms a folding line around which the 
bodies can be folded out from their packaging state, and 
which includes an arcuate

<CLAIMS>
An absorbent disposable article such as a sanitary 
napkin, a panty protector, a diaper or an incontinence 

guard, 
characterized
 in that the article 
comprises at least two generally flat, flexible bodies 

(1, 2) which include absorbent material and which in a 
packaging state can lie against one another with first 

flat sides which are intended to face towards the wearer 
when the article is in use; in that two neighbouring 

bodies (1, 2) of the article are mutually joined along a 
first common edge (3
) which forms a folding line around 
which the bodies can be folded out from their packaging 

state and which includes an arcuate section (5) which, in 
the packaging state of the article, is arched 

towards a 
second opposing edge of the bodies (1, 2). 
An article according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that it is composed of a pair of bodies 

(1, 2) which are mirror-symmetrical in the longitudinal 
direction of the article. 
An article according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the mutually joined edges (3) 

of the bodies (1, 2) are S-shaped. 
An article according to any one of Claims 1-3, 

characterized
 in that the bodies (1, 2) are 
comprised of an outer, liquid-impermeable casing 

material, an inner, liquid-permeable casing material 
which is intended to lie nearest the wearer's body when 

the article is worn, and an absorbent pad enclosed 
between the casing sheets. 
An article according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, 
characterized
 in that the bodies  
 

are two mirror-symmetrical bodies 
(1, 2), having a common S-shaped edge (3), and in that 

the two arcuate sections which form the S-shape are 
mirror-symmetrical in relation to a line passing through 

the ends of said sections.
