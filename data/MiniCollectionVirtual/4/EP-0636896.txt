<ABSTRACT>
A Boundary-Scan cell (12') for facilitating testing of an electronic 
device (10), includes a system flip-flop (30') interposed between an output buffer 

(18) of the device and an internal logic block which drives the buffer (with 
FROMCKT). The system flip-flop has asynchronous clear and preset capability 

which allows the flip-flop to be cleared or preset as necessary so that its output bit 
reflects a bit previously latched in the Boundary-Scan cell during testing. During 

non-testing intervals, the preset and clear capability of the system flip-flop 
(30') is 

disabled to allow the flip-flop to pass a bit between the internal logic of the device 
and the output buffer without undue propagation delays.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circuit for enabling Boundary-Scan testing of 
an electronic device in the manner prescribed by the ANSI/IEEE 1149.1 Standard on 
Boundary-Scan during a testing mode, and for enabling the device to operate with 
reduced propagation delays during non-testing intervals. To facilitate the testing of a digital electronic device, such as an 
integrated circuit, or a circuit board containing a plurality of integrated circuits or 
even a group of boards, a testing technique known as Boundary-Scan has been 
developed. The Boundary-Scan test technique, which is now embodied in the 
ANSI/IEEE 1149.1 Standard on Boundary-Scan, is practiced by providing a 
Boundary-Scan cell, typically a single-bit shift register, at each output node (e.g., 
pin) of the electronic device which is coupled to an input node of another device. 
The Boundary-Scan cell is interposed between the output node and an internal logic 
block which drives the node, respectively. Each Boundary-Scan cell associated with 
each separate node is coupled in series with each of the other cells in a single chain 
(referred to as a Boundary-Scan chain) such that the output of each preceding cell is 
supplied to an input of the next succeeding cell in the chain. Actual testing in accordance with the Boundary-Scan test technique is 
accomplished by shifting a known string of bits through the chain of Boundary-Scan 
cells so that each bit in the string is latched into a separate cell. For each Boundary-Scan 
cell coupled to an output node, the cell is "updated," i.e., the bit previously 
shifted into the cell now appears at the output node associated with the cell. As a 
consequence, a Boundary-Scan cell associated with an input node will "capture" (i.e., 
be supplied with) the bit appearing at an output node of another device which drives 
this input node. Thus, when each output node is "updated," the logic value presented 
to the Boundary Scan cell associated with the input node driven by the updated 
output node will likely change. Once each Boundary-Scan cell associated with an input node has 
captured the bit appearing at the output node driving the input node, then the string 
of bits held by the chain of Boundary-Scan cells is shifted out. A comparison is then 
made between the string of shifted-out bits and a reference bit string representing the 
bits that would be obtained when the inter-device connections (i.e., the connections  
 
between the output and the input nodes of the devices) are fault-free. Any 
differences
