<DESCRIPTION>
The process of the present invention relates to
a process for purifying an aqueous reaction and/or
washing medium which contains cellulose ethers.Cellulose ethers are generally produced by
reacting cellulose, an alkali metal hydroxide and at
least one etherifying agent in an aqueous medium which
optionally contains one or more organic solvents. After
separation of the produced crude cellulose ether the
remaining aqueous reaction medium generally contains
various impurities, such as hot water-insoluble
cellulose ethers as well as hot water-soluble cellulose
ethers and/or macromolecular cellulose ether by-products.
The crude cellulose ether is usually washed
with hot water and/or steam for purification purposes.
After this washing step the washing medium also contains
various impurities, such as hot water-insoluble
cellulose ethers as well as hot water-soluble cellulose
ethers and/or macromolecular cellulose ether by-products.
The reaction and/or washing medium is usually
purified in a biological water purification plant.
Unfortunately, the cellulose ethers are poorly
biodegradable and cause various problems in the
biological water purification plant, such as foaming,
poor settling of the biomass or even flotation and loss
of the biomass. Accordingly, it would be desirable to
pre-treat at least a portion of the reaction and/or
washing medium originating from cellulose ether
production before feeding the medium into a biological
water purification plant. U.S. patent 4,762,113 suggests purification of
liquid media which comprise low-, medium- and high-boiling
organic by-products and low-, medium- and high
boiling, residual, non-reacted organic reaction
compounds produced from the preparation of cellulose
ethers, an alkali metal hydroxide and at least one
etherifying agent in an aqueous medium. The
purification is carried out in two steps. First the
low-boiling organic by-products of the reaction and
residual, non-reacted, low-boiling organic reaction
components are separated by distillation. The aqueous
distillation residue is treated by ultrafiltration. A
polyether sulfone membrane is recommended for the
ultrafiltration step. In the ultrafiltration step the
aqueous distillation residue is separated into a
permeate, having a reduced COD value, and a concentrate
which substantially comprises undesirable salts and
cellulose constituent. The US patent teaches that the
concentration of the concentrate should not be raised to
a level which is too high since with increasing
concentration the retained amount of

A process for purifying an aqueous reaction
and/or washing medium containing i) a hot water-insoluble

cellulose ether, (i.e. one having a gel point in the
range of 45 to 75°C) and ii) a hot water-soluble

cellulose ether and/or macromolecular cellulose ether by-product
(i.e. one having no gel point even at

temperatures above 80°C),

wherein

in a purification step a) the aqueous medium has a
temperature above the gel point of the hot water-insoluble

cellulose ether and gelled cellulose ether is
separated from the aqueous medium by means of a solid-bowl

centrifuge or a disk separator and

liquor which fed to the membrane device divided by the

volume of concentrate) is at least 40.

medium contains i) from 0.05 to 1.5% of hot water-insoluble

cellulose ether and ii) from 0.01 to 2% of hot
water-soluble cellulose ether and/or cellulose ether by-product,

by the total weight of the aqueous medium.

in step a) at least 95% of the weight of the gelled hot

water-insoluble cellulose ether i) are removed from the
aqueous medium.

scroll discharge centrifuge.

prior to purification are removed from the aqueous medium in
the purification steps a) and b).
The process of any one of claims 1 to 9

aqueous medium and
