<ABSTRACT>
A therapeutical or diagnosing agent contains as active substance at least one nucleic acid which hybridises with a pax gene, or atleast a pax protein, or at least one antibody against a pax protein or one of its derivates. These agents are used for diagnosing and/or treating tumors, and also as antisense nucleic acids for inhibiting gene expression.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of an agent for tumour
diagnostics or/and tumour therapy,
wherein

an active substance which contains

(a) at least one nucleic acid which hybridizes
with a Pax gene,
(b) at least one Pax protein or/and
(c) at least one antibody against a Pax protein
or a derivative thereof

is formulated, if desired with common

pharmaceutical carrier substances, auxiliary
substances and diluents.
Process as claimed in claim 1,
wherein

the agent contains at least one nucleic acid which
hybridizes with a Pax gene as the active substance.
Process as claimed in claim 2,
wherein

the agent contains as the active substance at least
one nucleic acid which comprises (a) a nucleotide

sequence coding for a Pax protein, (b) a part
thereof, (c) a nucleotide sequence hybridizing

under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid from
(a) or/and (b) or (d) a nucleotide sequence

complementary to a nucleic acid from (a), (b)
or/and (c). 
Process as claimed in claim 2 or 3,
wherein

the agent contains at least one nucleic acid which
comprises (a) a nucleotide sequence coding for the

amino acids 1 to 74 of a "paired" domain, (b) a
part thereof, (c) a nucleotide sequence hybridizing

under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid from
(a) or/and (b) or (d) a nucleotide sequence

complementary to a nucleic acid from (a), (b)
or/and (c).
Process as claimed in one of the claims 2 to 4,
wherein

the agent contains at least one nucleic acid which
comprises (a) a nucleotide sequence coding for the

amino acids 5 to 19, 35 to 41, 68 to 74, 95 to 100
or/and 115 to 120 of a "paired" domain, (b) a part

thereof, (c) a nucleotide sequence hybridizing
under stringent conditions with a nucleic acid from

(a) or/and (b) or (d) a nucleotide sequence
complementary to a nucleic acid from (a), (b)

or/and (c).
Process as claimed in claim 2 or 3,
wherein

the agent contains nucleotide sequences from the
non-conserved region of a Pax gene.
Process as claimed in one of the claims 2 to 6,
wherein

the agent contains at least one nucleic acid which
contains nucleotide sequences from a Pax gene from 

the group of genes comprising Pax-1, Pax-2, Pax-3,
Pax-4, Pax-5, Pax-6, Pax-7, Pax-8, HuP1, HuP2,

HuP48, prd, BSH4, BSH9, Pox neuro and Pox meso.
Process as claimed in one of the claims 2 to 7,
wherein

the nucleic acid is a DNA.
Process as claimed in one of the claims 2 to 7,
wherein

the nucleic acid is a RNA which is modified if
desired.
Process as claimed in one of the claims 2 to 9 as a
molecular probe in tumour diagnostics.
Process as claimed in one of the claims 2 to 9 as
an antisense nucleic acid for the inhibition of

gene expression.
Process as claimed in claim 1,
wherein

the agent contains at least one Pax protein as the
active substance.
Process as claimed in claim 12,
wherein

the agent contains at least one Pax protein from
the group comprising Pax-1, Pax-2, Pax-3, Pax-4,

Pax-5, Pax-6, Pax-7, Pax-8, HuP1, HuP2, Hup48, prd,
BSH9, Pox neuro and Pox meso. 
Process as claimed in claim 1,
wherein

the agent contains as the active substance at least
one antibody against a Pax protein or a derivative

thereof.
Process as claimed in claim 14,
wherein

the antibody is directed against one or several Pax
proteins from the group comprising Pax-1, Pax-2,

Pax-3, Pax-4, Pax-5, Pax-6, Pax-7, Pax-8, HuP1,
HuP2, Hup48, prd, BSH9, Pox neuro and Pox meso.
Process for the in vitro diagnostics of tumours,
wherein

an active substance is used which contains

(a) at least one nucleic acid which hybridizes
with a Pax gene
(b) at least one Pax protein or/and
(c) at least one antibody against a Pax protein or

a derivative thereof.
