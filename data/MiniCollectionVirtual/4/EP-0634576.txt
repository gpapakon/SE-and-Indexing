main shaft (11), a main bearing house (6) in which said 

main shaft (11) is supported on bearings (12), a 
secondary shaft (13) connected to the main shaft (11) and 

revolving around the geometrical axis (7) of the main

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a transmission with revolving 
bearing containing a main shaft, a main bearing house in 
which said main shaft is supported on bearings, a 
secondary shaft connected to the main shaft and revolving 
around the geometrical axis of the main shaft, whose 
geometrical axis is parallel to but eccentrically in 
relation to the geometrical axis of the main shaft, and 
a revolving bearing house in which the secondary shaft 
revolving together with the bearing house is supported on 
the revolving bearing in a revolving manner according to 
its geometrical axis. Such transmissions are used among others to drive a scroll 
compressor. The fixed scroll is fixed in relation to the 
stationary main bearing house, whereas the moveable scroll 
working in conjunction with it is fixed in relation to 
the revolving bearing house.  
 A scroll compressor comprising a transmission of the above 
kind is disclosed in DE-A-4.100.328. There is no hermetic separation between the bearings around 
the main shaft and the revolving bearing around the 
secondary shaft.  
 Among others in such applications, the bearings of the 
transmission are greased and sealed separately. At very 
high rotary speeds of the transmission, whereby the scroll 
compressors can work with a greater capacity and a 
greater output, the centrifugal load on the revolving 
bearing largely increases. Very thorough greasing becomes necessary. Grease can no 
longer guarantee this. Oil lubrication is not applied 
because of sealing problems due to the special movement 
of the revolving bearing.  
 The invention aims to remedy this disadvantage and to 
provide a transmission with revolving bearing whereby oil 
lubrication can be applied and subsequently a very good 
lubrication and a very high speed can be obtained. This aim is reached according to the invention because 
the transmission contains a seal which is situated 
between the inside of the main bearing house and the 
outside of the revolving bearing house, seals the opening 
between these bearing houses and is fixed in relation to 
the whole consisting of the main shaft and the secondary 
shaft. In a particular embodiment according to the invention, 
the seal contains a ring which is fixed on a radially 
protruding part which extends into or opposite the 
opening between the inside of the main bearing house and 
the outside of the revolving bearing house and which 
stands on the whole consisting of the main shaft and the 
secondary shaft. In a particular embodiment according to the
