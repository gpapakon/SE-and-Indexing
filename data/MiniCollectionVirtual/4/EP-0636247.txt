<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
method and composition for reducing the effects of
endogenous alkaline phosphatase. In particular,
this invention utilizes a composition containing a
combination of detergents and inhibitors, to
reduce the effects that endogenous alkaline
phosphatase found in some human bodily fluid
samples have on solid phase assay systems.The Alkaline Phosphatases (ALPs) are a group
of functionally similar enzymes which are found in
nearly all organisms. They are magnesium and
zinc containing enzymes and are inhibited by metal
chelators. ALPs function to hydrolyze
monophosphate esters such as phosphate esters of
primary alcohols and phenols. Phosphates inhibit
ALP activity. The hydrolysis reaction has an
alkaline optimum pH. Whenever the term ALP or
ALPs are used it can mean any one of these
families of enzymes.In organisms exhibiting tissue
differentiation, ALPs appear in many of the
different tissues and are named after the tissue
of origin. ALPs originating from different
tissues show slight differences in stability,
catalytic properties and susceptibility to
inhibition to a variety of inhibitors. Fishman,
W.H. Alkaline Phosphatase Isozymes: Recent
Progress, Clinical Biochemistry 1990; 23: pp. 99-104.
For example, human ALPs from bone, liver and 
kidney show differential mobility on
electrophoresis due to differences in their sialic
acid content. Moss, D.W., Alkaline Phosphatase
Isoenzymes, Clinical Chemistry 1982; 28: pp. 2007-2016.Because of their enzymatic nature, ALPs have
been used as a component in solid phase diagnostic
assays as the label or indicator molecule to
detect the presence or concentration of an analyte
contained in a human bodily fluid sample. The
label can be covalently attached to an analyte (or
an analogue of the analyte) and the labeled
analyte competes for a limited number of analyte
receptors (e.g. antibodies) in a competitive assay
format. Alternatively a label can be covalently
attached to a second analyte receptor in a
sandwich assay format. In both cases the label
with its covalently attached analyte or analyte
receptor is often called a conjugate.The label of a conjugate must directly or
indirectly produce a measurable signal. For
example, the label of the conjugate can be a
fluorescent or colorimetric compound or it can be
an enzyme which produces a fluorescent,
electrochemical, chemiluminescent, thermometric,
or colorimetric signal when the enzyme reacts with
a substrate molecule. The amount of signal formed
is correlated with the amount
