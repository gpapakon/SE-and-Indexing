<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a method for determining optimised parameter values for a casting process, particularly on die-casting machines or the like. In this method, known data sets containing individual parameters are processed in such a way in an optimisation program that the individual data sets are executed automatically without the machine stopping. In a subsequent automatic quality control of the samples produced, data sets with optimum parameter values for series production are compiled.

Process for detecting optimized parameter values of a 
casting process especially on die-casting machines or the like, 

in which case known sets of data of individual parameters of a 
casting cycle are available, characterised in that different sets 

of data for an optimization programme are filed in a tool data 
memory of the casting machine control and that by means of this 

optimization programme a set of data is respectively transferred 
in succession from the data memory automatically to the machine 

control without external manual intervention and without stopping 
the machine and a predetermined number of test casting cycles is 

carried out with this set of data, that the products produced in 
the test cycles with a set of data are investigated as regards 

their quality by measuring techniques and evaluated in an 
automatic quality control and that optimum parameter data sets 

of a series of measured values are used for later production of 
mass-produced parts. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
parameter data sets (D
1
 to D
n
) each has a predetermined number of 
individual parameters (p
1
 to p
7
), which respectively in a 
programme step (1 to n) of the optimization programme carry out 

a certain, predetermined number of casting cycles. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the data sets (D
1
 to D
n
) run by means of the optimization 
programme lead to test products, which within a programme run 

with a certain data set are evaluated in accordance with given 
physical evaluation criteria (A, B) by known measuring methods 

and that the ascertained average values (A
m
, B
m
) of each 
programme step with a certain set of data provide evidence about 

the grade of the product quality with this set of data. 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the analysis of the products produced with 

respectively one set of data takes place by way of a known  
 

measured value monitoring of physical properties of the product 
and that the quality of the measured values leads to an 

evaluation mark, whereof the average value for each physical 
evaluation criterion is ascertained for each set of data. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
different limiting quantities, such as for example speed phase 

1, speed phase 2, tripping position in phase 2 or the like are 
available in different, graduated values, which in each case in 

all combinations are combined automatically by the computer to 
form a given parameter data set and that the optimization 

programme runs through each of these combined parameter data sets 
in one programme step in succession to detect optimum values, 

without interrupting the technical casting process on the die-casting 
machine or the like. 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the evaluation of the physical evaluation 

criteria (A, B) takes place on a different evaluation scale 
according to the weighting of the individual parameter, 

parameters having a greater effect obtaining a higher weighting 
and parameters having a lesser effect obtaining a lower 

weighting. 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the quality control of the test parts 

produced takes place by means of an automatic measuring 
arrangement for given measured values such as shrink hole 

formation, surface quality, breaking tests etc. 
Process according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that after the automatic evaluation of the 

measurement results of test castings, quality-relevant tolerance 
zones for the casting parameters are fixed.
