<ABSTRACT>
A method and test kit to perform a simple detection 
assay for D-dimer, a fibrin breakdown product, which utilizes 

purified Fragment E of human fibrinogen attached to a solid phase 
for direct chemical binding of D-dimer from a biological sample. 

This direct binding method to assay for D-dimer of the present 
invention can be performed in a number of ways. In one 

embodiment of the invention, Fragment E is conjugated to latex 
carrier particles and an agglutination assay performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a kit for detecting
D-dimer, a fibrin breakdown product which can be indicative of
disorders of the blood clotting system, which utilizes a
Fragment E reagent, which directly chemically binds to D-dimer in
a biological sample.The most common disorder of the human blood clotting
system is the formation of thrombi, blood clots, which when
formed in vessels such as the heart can restrict blood flow and
result in severe heart attacks. In addition, movement of the
thrombus, or a portion of it, within the circulatory system can
result in thromboembolism, by suddenly blocking blood flow.
Patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy due to hypercoagulable
conditions require careful monitoring of clot breakdown.
Therefore, it is important to have sensitive and specific means
to detect fibrinolysis, the breakdown of blood clots.Fibrin consists of a web of branching fibers of an
adhesive nature, with the power of coagulating whole blood in
which it is suspended. Fibrinolysis is a system complementary to
the coagulation process, and normally in equilibrium with it,
disposing of deposits of fibrin. The digestion of fibrin by the
enzyme plasmin produces split products including D-dimer. In pathologic fibrinolysis, plasma concentrations of
plasmin degradation products of fibrinogen and fibrin are
augmented. Therefore, the presence of fibrinogen breakdown
products (FDP) in human blood or urine are indicative of
thrombotic disorders. FDP have been measured traditionally by
agglutination assays. For example: by staphylococcal clumping;
by hemagglutination immunoassay; or by the use of latex particles to
which an antiserum has been attached.Hawiger et al., "Measurement of Fibrinogen and Fibrin
Degradation Products in Serum by Staphylococcal Clumping Test",
J. Lab. Clin. Med. 75:93-108 (1970) disclosed a test based on the
fact that a specific strain of Staphylococcus will clump in the
presence of monomeric fibrin or higher molecular weight FDP. In
this method, serial dilutions of serum or urine samples are mixed
with suspensions of Staphylococcus cells and the presence or
absence of clumping is noted.Merskey et al., "A Rapid, Simple, Sensitive Method for
Measuring Fibrinolytic Split Products in Human Serum", Proc. Soc.
Exp. Biol. Med. 131:871-875 (1969) disclosed a two-step
hemagglutination-inhibition test. In the first step, dilutions
of the test serum sample are incubated with a dilute solution of
antibodies to human fibrinogen. In the second step, unreacted
antibody is detected by adding tanned red
