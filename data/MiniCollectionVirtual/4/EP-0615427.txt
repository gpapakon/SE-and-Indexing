<DESCRIPTION>
 LΛTERAL OFFSET CONNECTOR FOR SPINAL IMPLANT SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention broadly concerns devices for use i spinal implant systems, particularly those using spinal rods contoured for connection at various locations along the length of the spinal column. More specifically, the invention concerns a device for fixing the spinal rod to a fixation element of the implant system which provides direct engagement to a vertebra of the spinal column. Several techniques and systems have been developed for use in correcting and stabilizing spinal curves and facilitating spinal fusion. In one system, a bendable rod i longitudinally disposed adjacent the vertebral column and is fixed to various vertebrae along the length of the column by way of a number of fixation elements. A variety of fixation elements can be provided, such as hooks or bone screws, whic are configured to engage specific portions of the vertebra.An example of one such system is the TSRH® spinal system of Danek Medical, Inc. In this system, the hooks or screws are engaged to the spinal rod by way of eyebolts. As is well known in the art, the eyebolts are threaded onto the spinal rod and captured within yokes on the fixation hook or screw. A nut is threaded onto a threaded post of the eyebolt to clamp the yoke and rigidly fix the hook or screw element to the spinal fixation rod. Details of the TSRH spinal implant system are disclosed in the "Surgical Technique Manual" provided by Danek Medical, Inc., published in 1990, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.It is the goal of the surgeon using such spinal implant systems to apply the vertebral fixation elements (hooks and/or screws) to the spine in the appropriate anatomic 

 position, and then to engage each fixation element to the spinal rod. Once the spinal implant system is assembled it is then possible to correct anatomical deformities and stabilize the spine. In the ideal circumstance, the fixation elements are located in a colinear position substantially parallel to the vertebral column. However, in many circumstances particular vertebrae may deviate from this colinear position. Under these circumstances, it is often - necessary to contour the rod in the saggital plane to account for abnormal lateral curvatures of the spine, such as scoloitic curvatures. After the rod has been contoured as dictated by the anatomy, the fixation hooks or bone screws can be engaged directly to the laterally offset vertebrae. This lateral offset of the vertebral column in the

<CLAIMS>
 WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A lateral offset connector for use in a spinal implant system to connect a vertebral fixation element to a spinal rod extending adjacent the vertebral column in a patient, the connector comprising: a head portion; a pair of parallel arms integrally extending from said head portion along a longitudinal axis, said pair of arms being displaced from each other perpendicular to said longitudinal axis to define a slot opening therebetween, said slot opening being sized to receive an eyebolt assembly therethrough; a plurality of grooves defined in a surface of each of said pair of arms, each of said plurality of grooves being aligned between said pair of arms and each of said plurality of grooves being formed at a radius configured to receive the spinal rod therein; a threaded post integrally extending from said head portion along said longitudinal axis in a direction opposite said pair of parallel arms; and a nut for engaging said threaded post, whereby the vertebral fixation element is clamped between said head portion and said nut when said nut is engaged on said threaded post.
2. The lateral offset connector of claim 1, wherein said head portion includes a curved shoulder arranged to contact the vertebral fixation element when the fixation element is clamped between said head portion and said nut.
3. The lateral offset connector of claim 1 in which the vertebral fixation element includes a yoke portion defining a yoke opening, wherein said head portion includes a guide portion with said threaded post extending from said guide portion, said guide portion having a rectangular 


 cross-section along said longitudinal axis to engage within the yoke opening of the vertebral fixation element to restrain rotation of the fixation element about said longitudinal axis.
4. An assembly for use in a spinal implant system to connect a plurality of vertebral fixation element to a spinal rod extending adjacent the vertebral column in a patient in which the plurality of fixation elements are non-colinear, the assembly comprising: a lateral offset connector including; a head portion; a pair of parallel arms integrally extending from said head portion along a longitudinal axis, said pair of arms being displaced from each other perpendicular to said longitudinal axis to define a slot opening therebetween; a plurality of grooves defined in a surface of each of said pair of arms, each of said plurality of grooves being aligned between said pair of arms and each of said plurality of grooves being formed at a radius configured to receive the spinal rod therein perpendicular to said longitudinal axis; a threaded post integrally extending from said head portion along said longitudinal axis in a direction opposite said pair of parallel arms; and a nut for engaging said threaded post, whereby the vertebral fixation element is clamped between said head portion and said nut when said nut is engaged on said threaded post; means, disposed within said slot opening, for clamping said pair of arms to the spinal rod with the spinal rod disposed within one of said plurality of grooves in each of said pair of arms, whereby the spinal rod can be adjustably disposed within said one of said plurality of grooves with said pair of arms spanning the distance between the spinal rod and the vertebral fixation element.
