<ABSTRACT>
In known winding machines equipped with flyer-type traversing devices, the axes of the two rotors are inclined, so that the yarn run forms an acute angle  alpha  with the planes of rotation. There is a narrow clearance d between the planes of rotation of the two flyers. As a result of the inclination, therefore, the circle of rotation of the flyers of one rotor projects somewhat beyond the circle of rotation of the flyers of the other rotor in the traversing region. As a result, the flyer constellations and cycles of movement at the two stroke ends are not exactly identical. This brings about a differing bobbin build-up on the two end faces. The new device is to remedy this shortcoming. For this purpose, the axis of the rotor (14), the flyers (15, 16) of which rotate in the plane of rotation further away from the guide roller (2), is set back in the direction at right angles to the axis (2') of the guide roller (2) relative to the axis of the other rotor (8) by the amount  a = d.cot  alpha . This arrangement ensures that, exactly at the moment when the flyers have reached the angular position corresponding to the stroke end, the delivering flyer has dipped down behind the yarn running surface and the receiving flyer rises out of the yarn running surface.

<CLAIMS>
A device for taking up yarns on a spool,
 
with a spool spindle,
 
with a guide roll
 
and with a traversing device which has two rotors driven 

in opposite directions and each having at least two 
blades arranged in propeller fashion,
 
the axes of the two rotors being parallel to but slig
htly 
spaced apart from one another,
 
there being a small distance d between the rotation 

planes in which the blades of the two rotors rotate,
 
and the yarn contact surface at the extremities of the 

traversing region forming an acute angle α with the two 
rotation planes,
 
characterised in that the axis of the rotor (14) whose 

blades (15, 16) rotate in the rotation plane further from 
the guide roll (2), is set back by comparison with the 

axis of the other rotor (8) in the direction 
perpendicular to the axis (2') of the guide roll (2) by 

the dimension 

a = d.cot α. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 
axes of the two rotors (8, 14) are also offset in the 

direction parallel to the axis (2') of the guide roll 
(2).
