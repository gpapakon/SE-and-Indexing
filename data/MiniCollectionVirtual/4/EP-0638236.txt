<ABSTRACT>
A method for enhancing the effectiveness of an 
agricultural chemical which comprises incorporating a 

specific enhancer into a diluted solution of the 
agricultural chemical. 
The specific enhancer is a quaternary ammonium 
salt or a tertiary amine or a salt thereof containing one or more 

carboxylic acid ester or amide groups, at least one long chain alkyl or 
alkenyl group and optionally also ether groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
enhancing the effectiveness of an agricultural
chemical, a novel agricultural chemical composition
containing a specific enhancer and a use of an
enhancer for the preparation of the agricultural
chemical composition.Agricultural chemicals including insecticides,
fungicides (or bactericides), herbicides, miticides
(or acaricides) and plant growth regulators have been
used in the forms of, for example, emulsions, wettable
powders, granules, powders and flowables. In the
properties of these agricultural chemical
preparations, various attempts have been made to
achieve the maximum effectiveness of the agricultural
chemicals. However, it has been difficult to enhance
the effectiveness of agricultural chemicals through
adjustments in formulations. It is further difficult
to develop novel agricultural chemicals. Therefore,
further enhancement of existing agricultural chemicals
would highly contribute to the industry. As substances capable of enhancing agricultural
chemicals, surfactants comprising various nitrogen-containing
compounds such as quaternary ammonium
salts, betaines and amine oxides have been known (see
European Patent Publication-A No. 274369, published on
July 13, 1988). It is known that quaternized or
further polyoxyethylenated long-chain amines, among
the above-mentioned compounds, are effective for this
purpose. However, the enhancement effect of the above
described compounds capable of enhancing agricultural
chemicals is not always satisfied.WO 91/16024 discloses cationic lipids which assist the penetration of bioactive
agents into cells such as plant cells and compositions containing the cationic
lipids with the bioactive agents.US-A 4,883,917 discloses quaternary ammonium compounds and especially
tetradecyl dimethyl 2-methoxyethyl ammonium chloride and their use as
fungicides, algicides, bactericides and bleach activators.JP 2169554 refers to specific unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives and
their use as phytopathogenic fungicides.JP 81039168 discloses quaternary ammonium compounds containing organic
groups being used as additives for silkworm feedstuff.EP 509 346 discloses quaternary ammonium salts being useful as activators for
agricultural chemicals. The compositions may contain surfactants such as non-ionic
surfactants. From the viewpoint that the effectiveness of the
agricultural chemicals can be enhanced by the combined
use of agricultural chemicals with quaternary ammonium
salts or amines, the present inventors have
