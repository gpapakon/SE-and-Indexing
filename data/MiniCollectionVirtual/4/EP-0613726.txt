<ABSTRACT>
A sheet of an absorbent material which, comprises a blend of 
a fibrous substance and of a granulated substance in which the granulated 

substance is non-uniformly distributed in the sheet, there being alternating 
zones of higher and of lower density of said substance along the sheet, is 

prepared by vacuum depositing (16) a dispersion of the fibrous substance 
(20) on a moving screen (14) and continuously applying the granulated 

substance (24) while changing the zone of application in a pendulum-like 
fashion (34, 36) along the screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for the 
manufacture of a sheet of an absorbent material (hereinafter, at times "absorbent 
sheet"). 
The invention further concerns an apparatus for the manufacture 
of a continuous sheet of an absorbent material. 
More specifically, the present invention provides a process and 
an 
apparatus for the manufacture of an absorbent sheet comprising a blend of a first, 
fibrous substance, and a second, granulated substance, wherein the second 
substance is non-uniformly distributed, there being portions of increased 
concentration of said second substance, where said second substance is most 
needed. A specific application of the present invention is in the 
formation of an absorbent sheet for use as an absorbent medium in 
disposable diapers. Disposable diapers generally comprise a liquid absorbent layer 
sandwiched between an external, liquid impervious layer, and an internal, 
liquid permeable liner. In order to perform its function well, the absorbent 
layer has to be capable of absorbing large quantities of liquids, many folds  
 
larger than its own weight. The main component of the absorbent layer is 
a fibrous substance such as wood pulp fibers, and in order to improve the 
liquid absorbance, this layer is supplemented with granules of super 
absorbent polymers (SAP) which typically constitute about 17-20% of the 
absorbent layer. SAP is capable of absorbing about 35-40 times its weight 
in liquid whereas wood pulp fibers are capable of absorbing only about 7 
times their weight in liquid. However, SAP, is an expensive material and 
costs about three times more than wood pulp fibers. Good liquid absorbance is most important in the front half of 
the diaper at the area coming in contact with the child's genitals and crotch 
region. Thus, in view of its high price tag it would have been desirable to 
have the bulk of the SAP in a diaper in the front half and only a small part 
of the SAP in the rear half of the diaper. A very desirable ratio between the 
amount of SAP in the front and in the rear half of the diaper would be about 
8:2, i.e. 80% of the SAP in the front half of the diaper and only 20% in the 
rear half. However, none of the methods available to date in preparing a 
disposal diaper allows such a distribution of SAP. The absorbent material of disposable diapers is typically 
formed as a continuous sheet, which is then sandwiched between the liquid 
impervious layer on the one hand and the liquid permeable liner on the other 
hand and cut according

A process for the manufacture of a sheet of an absorbent material, the sheet 
comprising a blend of a first, fibrous substance, and of a second, granulated substance, said 

second substance being non-uniformly distributed in said sheet, there being alternating zones 
of higher and of lower concentration of said second substance along said sheet, said process 

comprising: 

introducing a dispersion (20) of said first substance into a vacuum chamber (12) 
having a continuous moving porous screen (14) at its bottom, the vacuum (10) in the 

chamber (12) being applied through said screen (14), whereby said first substance is being deposited 
on said screen (14); and continously discharging said second substance and depositing it onto an 

area (34) of said screen (14) from a discharge opening (24) of a discharge means, said discharge 
means adapted to cyclically reciprocate the zone of deposition of the second substance on the 

screen (14) between two points (34, 36) on a line parallel to the direction of movement of the 
screen (14); whereby zones of higher and of lower concentration of said second substance along 

said sheet are formed, two zones of equal concentration being distanced from one another by a 
distance equal to the distance travelled by the belt during one cycle of reciprocation of said 

discharge means. 
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the zone of deposition (34) of said 
substance is on the sheet's midline. 
A process according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein in 
a first half of the cycle, the area of deposition (34) moves at the same direction and at an 

average speed being essentially the same as that of the continuous moving porous screen (14). 
A process according to Claim 1, wherein said first substance is wood pulp and 
said second substance is a super absorbent polymer.  

 
An apparatus for the manufacture of a continuous sheet of an absorbent 
material, the sheet comprising a blend of a first fibrous substance and of a second, granulated 

substance, said second substance being non-uniformly distributed, there being alternating 
zones of higher and of lower concentration of said second substance along said sheet, said 

apparatus comprising: 

a vacuum chamber (12) having a formaminous screen (14) at its bottom, 
said screen (14) being 

capable 
of moving at a constant speed and driving the sheet deposited thereon through and out of said 

chamber (12), and having vacuum forming means adapted to form a vacuum (16) through said 
screen (14); 
means (18) for introducing said first substance into said chamber (12) in a dispersed form 
(20); and 
discharge means (22) for said second substance having a discharge opening (24) 
adapted to contiously discharge said second substance and depositing it onto an area (34) of 

said screen (14), and being further adapted to cyclically reciprocate the zone of deposition of the 
second substance on the screen (14) between two points (34, 36) on a line parallel to the direction 

of movement of the screen (14). 
An apparatus according to Claim 5, wherein the area of deposition of said 
second substance is on the sheet's midline. 
An apparatus according to Claim 5 or 6, wherein in a first half of a cycle the 
area of deposition moves at the same direction and at an average speed being essentially the 

same as that of the screen (14). 
An apparatus according to any one of Claims 5 to 7, wherein said discharge 
means (22) is an elastic pipe, having an opening (24) 
at its bottom end (23) which opening (24) 
is situated above the screen (14), said bottom end (23) being connected to driving means (26, 28)  

 
adapted to reciprocate said bottom end (23) between a first and a second position (30, 32) 

whereby the zone of deposition of said second substance reciprocates along said line. 
An apparatus according to Claim 8, wherein said driving means consist of a 
driving wheel (28) connected to the bottom end (23) of the pipe by means of a connecting rod 

(26), whereby rotation of said wheel (28) causes reciprocation of the pipe's bottom end (23).
