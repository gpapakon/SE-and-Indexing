<ABSTRACT>
Lighting device (1) comprising a deflector (2) capable of being recessed (flush-fitted) in a recess (11) provided in a partition (12, 13), the concavity of the reflector being turned towards the opening of the said recess (11), the deflector (2) being capable of being combined with at least one light generator (9) which can be arranged at one end (4) of this deflector, characterised in that the said deflector (2) is made from a hydrophilic pulverulent/powder material which can solidify once mixed with water.

Lighting device, comprising a deflector (2) adapted to be recessed in a
recess provided in a partition (12), the concavity of the deflector (2) facing the

opening of said recess, the deflector (2) being capable of being associated with at
least one light generating means (7) adapted to be disposed at one end of said

deflector,

   characterized in that said deflector (2) is made from a pulverulent
material/hydrophilic powder, capable of solidifying once mixed with water and

comprising plaster.
Device according to the preceding Claim, characterized in that the
recessable device allows a perfect, from the aesthetic viewpoint, join of the

periphery thereof with the edges of the opening of the recess.
Device according to one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that the
deflector (2) is extended, on said light generating means (7) side, by a bottom (4)

and a wall (5) in return substantially parallel to the deflector (2), so as to define a
cavity for receiving said light generating means.
Device according to the preceding Claim, characterized in that that part (3)
of the deflector (2) next to the base is plane and parallel to the partition (13).
Device according to one of Claims 3 to 4, characterized in that said return
(5) is disposed in the plane of the front face (12) of the partition.
Device according to one of the preceding Claims, characterized in that the
deflector (2) presents the general form of a spherical cap.
Device according to the preceding Claim, characterized in that the
deflector (2) is in the form of a truncated spherical cap. 
Device according to the preceding Claim, characterized in that a band (20)
is disposed along a diameter (21) of the deflector and at a height such that it can

shelter the light generating means and hide them from sight, when viewed from
the front.
Device according to one of Claims 7 or 8, characterized in that the circular
peripheral edge of the deflector defines a plane disposed substantially at the level

of the front face (12A) of the partition (12).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the
deflector (2) presents a polygonal opening, in a plane parallel to the partition.
