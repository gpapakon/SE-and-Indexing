<ABSTRACT>
A circuit arrangement is indicated for digital data communication between an exchange (VST) of a telecommunications network and subscribers (Tln) connected via lines (B) to this exchange, in which arrangement, in physical proximity to the subscribers (Tln), a terminal box (EVZ) with a network termination (NT) is inserted in the transmission path. Lines (B) with metal conductors are used between the terminal box (EVZ) and the subscribers (Tln). At least two terminal devices located on the subscribers' (Tln) premises for the transmission and reception of data are connected to each of these lines (B). A phase detector is disposed in the network termination (NT) for each connected line (B). Each terminal device has a phase shifter for temporal shifting of the transmission data. The data transmitted by a terminal device are adjusted by the phase shifter of this terminal device to a specific phase angle on the basis of a correction signal transmitted by the phase detector.
