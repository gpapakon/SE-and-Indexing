<ABSTRACT>
A device is described for controlling the opening of the 
loading port in washing-machines and the like comprising a 

pushbutton panel (1) provided with a pushbutton for opening the 
port (4) and a pushbutton for interrupting the mains electrical 

supply (6). An electromechanical device (60, 21, 27), selected 
from a plurality of thermoelectric devices functionally similar 

but constructionally different, is mechanically fastened to the 
pushbutton panel (1). Mechanical means (7, 40, 39) for coupling 

with said pushbutton for opening the port co-operate with 
movable mechanical elements (11, 13; 22; 28, 29) of said 

electromechanical device (60, 21, 27) with the object of 
preventing the operation of the port opening pushbutton (4) 

when, although the general electrical mains switch is open, the 
washing-machine is in a particular operating condition, for 

example, in the centrifuge condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the safe 
opening control of the loading port in washing-machines and the 
like. According to current safety regulations for 
washing-machines, it must not be possible to close the general 
electrical mains switch (and thus to start the machine) when 
the loading basket access door or port is open. Always 
according to the same regulations, after the unit has been 
started by closing the abovementioned general switch, it must 
not be possible, by pressing the port opening pushbutton, to 
open the port itself, it being compulsorily provided to this 
end that the general switch be reopened beforehand. Solutions are known for this purpose wherein the port's 
locking bolt is mechanically connected to the general switch, 
and the latter's position determines or otherwise the 
possibility of opening the port. Alternative solutions exist wherein the port's locking bolt 
is not connected mechanically to the general switch: it is 
possible, for instance, to provide for an opening handle 
located directly on the port. Obviously in this case the 
opening movement is deliberately made more difficult so as to 
prevent any specifically unwanted openings. But in order to 
ensure a sufficient degree of safety in use and to avert 
accidents, a microswitch is also associated with the port's 
locking bolt that ensures the opening of the machine's 
electrical power supply circuit when the port is open.  A further safety regulation also imposes that the immediate 
opening of the port after reopening the general electrical 
mains switch be prevented, while the washing-machine is in the 
centrifuge phase. Such a regulation provides that, under these 
conditions, the opening of the port be permitted only after a 
suitable delay time interval has elapsed, starting from the 
opening of the general switch, useful to ensure that the 
basket's rotational energy is by now almost completely 
exhausted. The devices capable of ensuring the abovementioned delay are 
generally of the electromechanical type, comprising 
electrically activated bimetallic strips to operate the 
intervention of mechanical elements suitable for inhibiting the 
opening of the port, and they can be located in the proximity 
of the bolt of the port itself. In such a case, however, it is necessary to make an 
electrical connection between the general switch, usually 
inserted in a pushbutton panel housed in the upper part of the 
machine's chassis, and the electromechanical device mounted on 
the port's closing
