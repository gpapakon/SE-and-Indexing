<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical waveguide
device. In preferred embodiments it
relates to an optical waveguide device having a
substrate comprising, as a principal component, lithium
niobate, and an optical waveguide, exhibiting a reduced
DC drift, and thus useful as an optical wave modulator.
The optical waveguide device of the preferred embodiments is
advantageous in that even under an application of a
controlling DC voltage, the device can exhibit a
stabilized operating property and is useful as a key
element, for example, a high speed optical intensity
modulator or a high speed optical switch, of an optical
communication system, an optical information treatment
system or an optical measurement system.In conventional optical waveguide devices
having a lithium niobate substrate, generation of DC
drift is a big problem to be solved. It is known that
the mechanism of the generation of the DC drift can be
explained by using an RC equivalent circuit model, as
described in:
S. Yamada and Minakata, Jpn. J. Appl.
Phys., Vol. 20 (1981), 733,C.M. Gee, G.D. Thurmond, H. Blauvetl and
H.M. Yen, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 47 (1985), 211, andR.A. Becker, Opt. Lett., Vol. 10
(1985), 417.Namely, it is known that the amount and
direction of the DC drift of an optical element greatly
depend on the electric resistance (R) and the electric
capacitance (C) of each of the lithium niobate substrate
and a dielectric layer formed on the substrate of the 
optical element, especially on a relaxation time (τ) of
the element which is defined as a product (RC) of the
electric resistance (R) and the electric capacitance (C).From the above-mentioned facts, it is
understood that the DC drift of the optical element can
be controlled by regulating the electric
resistance (R), electric capacitances (C) and relaxation
times (τ) of the substrate and dielectric layer of the
optical element.As particular means for controlling the
parameters of the optical element-forming materials, the
following techniques have been reported.According to H. Nagata, J. Ichikawa, M.
Kobayashi, J. Hidaka, H. Honda, K. Kiuchi and T.
Sugamata, Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 64 (1994), 1180, the
amount of DC-drift can be restricted by reducing the
content of hydrogen in the substrate. Particularly,
since hydrogen is introduced into the lithium niobate
substrate during a poling treatment of the substrate
crystal, the hydrogen content in the substrate can be
easily reduced by heat-treating the substrate in a dry
atmosphere. The mechanism of the relationship
