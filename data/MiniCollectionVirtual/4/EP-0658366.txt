<ABSTRACT>
A method for the recovery of oxygen from air in which a high-temperature 
ion transport membrane system is integrated with combustion 

turbine system. Coproduction of oxygen and electric power is achieved in an 
alternative embodiment by integrating a combined cycle power generation 

system with an ion transport membrane system. The design performance of 
the gas turbine in the combined cycle system is maintained by controlled 

water injection into the membrane non-permeate stream which is introduced 
into the gas turbine combustor. Alternatively, makeup air is added to the 

membrane feed to maintain the performance of the gas turbine. NOx 
formation is reduced by introducing the oxygen-depleted non-permeate fr
om 
the membrane system to the gas turbine combustor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to the recovery of oxygen by a high
temperature ion transport membrane system, and in particular to the
integration of a mixed conductor membrane system with a gas turbine power
generation system.Oxygen is an economically important gas which is widely used in
large-scale industrial applications. New uses for oxygen are emerging in
advanced high-temperature processes for iron and steel manufacture, coal
gasification, oxygen-enriched combustion, and in particular integrated
gasification combined cycle power generation. In these large-scale
applications, the cost of oxygen produced by conventional cryogenic or
noncryogenic technology is a major portion of the overall operating cost,
and lower oxygen cost will encourage the commercialization of these
emerging technologies. New oxygen separation processes which can be
thermally integrated with these advanced high-temperature processes will
reduce the energy consumed in oxygen production, which in turn will promote
the technical and commercial development of such integrated systems.Oxygen can be recovered from air at high temperatures by inorganic
oxide ceramic materials utilized in the form of selectively permeable nonporous
ion transport membranes. An oxygen partial pressure differential or
a voltage differential across the membrane causes oxygen ions to migrate
through the membrane from the feed side to the permeate side where the ions
recombine to form electrons and oxygen gas. An ion transport membrane of
the pressure-driven type is defined herein as a mixed conductor membrane, 
in which the electrons simultaneously migrate through the membrane ions to
preserve internal electrical neutrality. An ion transport membrane of the
electrically-driven type is defined herein as a solid electrolyte membrane
in which the electrons flow from the permeate side to the feed side of the
membrane in an external circuit driven by a voltage differential. A
comprehensive review of the characteristics and applications of such
membranes is given in report entitled "Advanced Oxygen Separation
Membranes" by J. D. Wright and R. J. Copeland, Report No. TDA-GRI-90/0303
prepared for the Gas Research Institute, September 1990.In the recovery of oxygen from air at high temperatures (typically
700째C to 1100째C) using ion transport membranes, a significant amount of heat
energy is available in the membrane permeate and non-permeate streams. The
effective use of this energy in the overall operation of a mixed conductor
membrane system is necessary if the system is
