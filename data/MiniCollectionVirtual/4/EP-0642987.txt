<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a containerization system which
is particularly suitable for storing, packaging and transporting toxic or hazardous
products.At present, most hazardous and toxic liquids are stored in metal drums or,
where smaller quantities are involved, in plastic containers. Hazardous compounds,
especially agrochemical compounds, are formulated in various compositions.The expression toxic or hazardous compounds as used herein means an
industrial chemical or agrochemical compound, which, if released in the quantity
or concentration normally in storage and shipping containers, may cause damage to
the environment or be injurious to a person contacted by it.With respect to agricultural chemicals, liquid compositions, particularly in
the form of concentrates, are most convenient for farmers because of the relative
ease with which they can be handled. There are, nevertheless, difficulties in
handling such liquid compositions. There is a danger of spillage or leakage if holes
develop in containers that are accidentally dropped and thereby crack or fail.
Containers have been developed which possess great resistance to impact and
shock. While such containers are secure under normal storage and handling
conditions, in the event of an accident, for example during transporting, there
remains an appreciable risk of spillage or leakage with rapid loss of liquid. Leakage
of toxic and hazardous chemicals can create damage to the environment.The chemical and packaging industries have long sought a secure
container which provides sufficient safeguard for those handling it, such as farmers
and transporters, as well as adequate protection for the environment. It is known, for example, to package agrochemicals in soluble bags or
sachets made from water soluble films.However there are some cases whereby the use of water soluble (or water
dispersible, as always contemplated herein) bags is either impossible or of highly
limited interest.This is or can be the situation when two or more agrochemicals are used
together to treat a crop or any kind of plant(s) and when only one of them is used in
the form of a water soluble bag.It is also or can be also the situation when two or more agrochemicals are
used together to treat a crop or any kind of plant(s) and when the normal use of
these agrochemicals is at a very different use rate. Indeed it is known that the use
rate of some pesticides may vary in the order of 10 or even 100 times from one
pesticide to another.Another situation where the use of a water soluble bag for
