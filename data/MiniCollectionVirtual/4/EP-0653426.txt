or 

wherein R¹⁰ is hydrogen or lower alkyl, 
dotted lines may optionally be resent, and R¹-R⁹ represents 

various substitutional groups. The compound (1) exhibits a 
positive inotropic action on cardiac muscle, an anti-arrhythmic 

action, and a vasodilation action without 
increasing the heart rate. A heart affection therapeutic

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel indole
derivative exhibiting pharmaceutical actions such as a
positive inotropic action, an anti-arrhythmic action, and a
vasodilation action, pharmaceutically acceptable salts
thereof, and a heart affection therapeutic agent comprising
as an active ingredient the indole derivative or the salt
thereof.Congestive heart failure is a state of disease
involving a reduction in the cardiac output due to
functional abnormalities of heart, accompanied by
incapability of ejecting a sufficient quantity of blood
required for tissues to metabolize. Heart failures were
recently described by J. N. Cohn as a syndrome caused by a
cardiac function insufficiency which involves (i) an
decrease in a kinetic tolerance capacity, (ii) frequent
occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia, and (iii) disorders
occurring during the aftercare (J. N. Cohn, Circulation, 78,
1099 (1988)).Diuretics, vasodilators and cardiac stimulants such as
digitalis are used for the improvement of these syndromes. Digitalis compounds are currently used widely as a
cardiac stimulant. Digoxin, one of digitalis compounds, has
been confirmed to promote cardiac ejection fractions and to
suppress acceleration of heart failures. Digoxin further
exhibits an action of decreasing the heart rate. It
exhibits a long sustained action, does not produce drug
resistance, and can be orally administered. In spite of
these significant advantages, the effective concentration in
blood and the toxic dose of digoxin are very close each
other. In addition, digoxin sometimes induces arrhythmia.
Because of these drawbacks of digoxin, research and
development of non-glycoside cardiac stimulants which can b
administered orally is being strongly promoted more
recently.WO91/13872 discloses heterocyclic indole compounds
which are useful in the treatment of central nervous system
and cardiovascular disorders.An object of the present invention is therefore to
provide a compound exhibiting a positive inotropic action,
an antiarrhythmic action, and a vasodilation action, and
useful as a heart affection therapeutic agent.In view of this situation the present inventors have
synthesized a number of compounds and have undertaken
screening of these compounds using the positive inotropic
action, the anti-arrhythmic action, and the vasodilation
action as indicators. As a result, the present inventors
have found that novel indole derivatives represented by
formula (1) described below and pharmaceutically acceptable
salts thereof can satisfy the above object
