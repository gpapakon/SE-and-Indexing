<ABSTRACT>
Device for injecting a solution into the body of an organism for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes, the said device comprising:   * a second feed conduit (1) for a solution, on which a valve (2) is mounted; * a first feed conduit (3) for a solution, on which a valve (4) is mounted; * a system (5) for heating the solution coming from the second feed conduit (1) and/or the first feed conduit (3), and   * an ejector or outlet (6)  the said heating system comprising:   * a chamber (7) in which an electrical resistor (8), not insulated from the solution to be heated, extends, the said resistor (8) being associated with a component (9) for controlling the electrical power supplied to the resistor (8), and * a system for regulating the electrical power supplied to the said resistor (8), receiving a signal from a sensor (11) detecting the temperature of the solution leaving the heating chamber (7) and a signal from a means (12, 13) defining the desired temperature, this regulation system also emitting a control signal to the control component (9); at least one (2) of the said valves emitting a signal to a means (17) intended to correct the signal emitted by the regulation system (10).
