<ABSTRACT>
For the sewing of single and double hems, there is arranged in front of the sewing head (1) a guide device (2) which guides the prefolded hem, without distorting it, under the pressure foot (3). The cloth is guided between two edging surfaces (5,6) movable relative to one another. The movability allows snug guidance in the case of single cloth layers, without thicker places in the cloth, such as, for example, transverse seams, being jammed in the guide. Before the thicker places in the cloth enter the guide, they are recognised by a sensor (20), for example by means of a marking, so that the edging surfaces (5,6) can be moved apart from one another by a drive device (13-16).
