<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a series of new
amide and urea compounds having anti-hypercholesteremic
activities and which can therefore be used in the
treatment and prophylaxis of hypercholesteraemia,
arteriosclerosis and like disorders. The invention also
provides methods and compositions using such compounds
as well as processes for their preparation.Among the causes of ischaemic cardiac insufficiency
(which may result in angina, myocardial infarction and
the like) atherosclerosis is thought to be most
important. It is believed that the foam cells under the
endodermis cell layer of blood vessels accumulate
cholesterol esters, and that this is a major cause of
arteriosclerosis.Inhibitors of acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyl transferase
(hereinafter referred as ACAT) inhibit the synthesis of
cholesterol esters in the foam cells, diminish the
accumulation of cholesterol esters and inhibit the
formation and development of atherosclerosis due to the
accumulation of cholesterol esters.Additionally, it has been established that there is
a correlation between arterioselerosis and
hypercholesterolaemia. Cholesterols in food are
absorbed as free cholesterol in the intestinal mucosal
cell tract. They are then esterified by ACAT, and get
into blood. Therefore, an ACAT inhibitor inhibits a
rise in the cholesterol concentration in blood by
inhibiting the absorption of food cholesterol into the 
blood.For this reason, compounds having the ability to
inhibit the activity of ACAT are useful for the
treatment and prophylaxis of atheroscleosis.The compounds of the present invention have a
(9H-xanthen-9-yl) methyl group, a 6,11-dihydrodibenz-[b.e]oxepine-11-yl
group, a (1-phenylcycloalkyl)methyl
group, a p-alkoxyphenyl group or an alkyl group attached
to an amido or ureido group. Compounds containing a
(9H-xanthen-9-yl)methyl group are disclosed in
Publications WO 93/06096 and EP 335375. Compounds
containing a 6,11-dihydrodibenz[b.e]oxepine-11-yl group
are disclosed in Publication EP 497201. Compounds
containing a (1-phenylcycloalkyl)methyl group are
disclosed in Publication EP 293880. Compounds
containing a p-alkoxyphenyl group are disclosed in
Publication EP 424194. Compounds containing an alkyl
group are disclosed in Publication EP 283742.
Diphenylurea compounds are disclosed in WO 92/03413.
Other somewhat similar compounds are disclosed in EP
Publications 439059 and 477778.The compounds of the present invention, and
especially those containing a (9H-xanthen-9-yl)methyl
group, have surprisingly been found to have a much
