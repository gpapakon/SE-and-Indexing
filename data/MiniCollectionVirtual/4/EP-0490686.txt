<ABSTRACT>
A gravity fed, "load-while-run" envelope feeder (10) has a high capacity envelope 
storage bin's (13) long dimension for placement against a printer (100) which creates a small 

footprint. The feeder (10) transfers the envelopes (30) from the storage bin (13) to a horizontal 
transportation area with the rotation of a motor driven blade (20) to within access of the printers' 

feed rollers (110). The blade (20) catches an envelope's flap to feed it and rotates it by 90Â° into the 
transportation area.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a continuous envelope feeder, and more particularly, 
but not exclusively, to a continuous envelope feeder adapted for use with printers, or the like, for 
placing printed matter, e.g. addresses onto envelopes for further processing. It has long been a desire unrealized to stack envelopes in a long edge (portrait) 
position within a magazine or bin for feeding to printer and be assured of feeding the envelopes 
individually. This desire has heretofore been thwarted because the friction that occurs between a 
stack of envelopes within a magazine is effected by pressure, temperature, humidity and 
coarseness of the envelopes. Any one of these parameters can cause a multi-feed. Attempts at overcoming the above-mentioned problems include U.S. Patent No. 
2,267,574 which discloses an envelope feeding mechanism that has a finger which is adapted to 
engage the flap of the lowest envelope in a feeding magazine to unfold the flap and move it 
between feed rollers which feed the envelope to a feed table. A means for successively feeding 
stacked envelopes to a printing press is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 1,724,199 that includes 
successive means active on the flap of the lowermost envelope for separating the same and 
pushing the envelope forward through a recess in a bed plate which holds the envelopes. An 
envelope feeding press is shown in U.S. Patent No. 2,521,237 that includes two rollers, a grasping 
means mounted on one roller for grasping envelopes within flap corners, means for releasing the 
envelopes including stationary finger members located between the flap and the body of an 
envelope, pivoted finger members located between the flap and envelope body, and two rods 
positioned parallel to the axis of one of the rollers. U.S. Patent No. 4,884,793 discloses an 
apparatus for stripping a single envelope from a stack of envelopes. The apparatus includes a 
picker blade which is articulated by a drive to impart a plurality of motions to the leading edge of 
an envelope to be separated from the stack. A high speed envelope feeding apparatus is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,846,455 in which the flap of a closed envelope is opened by raising a 
cam surface under the flap to position the flap between a fixed pinch roll and a movable pinch 
roll. The movable roll grasps the flap and extracts the envelope from the feeder to a transport 
device. Envelope flap opening members which are moved from an inoperative position to a flap 
opening position by the leading edge of an

<CLAIMS>
An envelope feed apparatus (10) for feeding envelopes one at a time from a 
stack of envelopes (30), including a stack support surface (15) for supporting a stack of envelopes 

(30), and picker means (20) arranged to engage an envelope (30) in the stack and advance the 

envelope (30) in a direction away from the stack, characterised in that said stack support surface 
(15) is positioned in a horizontal plane with respect to an envelope feeding direction and has a 

recessed area (16) therein, and is adapted to support the envelopes (30) in a flat coplaner 
configuration, flap down with the flap of the bottommost envelope (30) positioned within and 

extending into said recessed area (16), an opening being located immediately above said stack 
support surface (15), said opening being configured to permit only single envelopes (30) to pass 

therethrough; in that said picker means (20) is positioned in a horizontal plane adjacent to said 
stack support surface (15) and in that it comprises means for oscillating said picker means (20) from a first position 

into engagement with the crease between the body of the bottommost envelope (30) and the 
flap of the envelope (30) and rotating the envelope within the horizontal plane while being 

oscillated to a second position by said means for oscillating. 
An envelope feed apparatus (10) as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said stack support surface (15) is a bottom member (15) of bin means (13) for supporting said stack 

of envelopes (30), and said opening is an output opening in said bin means (13). 
An envelope feed apparatus (10) as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, characterised 
in that said picker means (20) is positioned adjacent to and beneath said stack support surface 

(15). 
An envelope feed apparatus (10) as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that said picker means (20) is adapted to rotate the envelope (30) by 90 degrees 

while oscillating to said second position. 
An apparatus (10) as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
said recessed area (16) is configured in the shape of an envelope flap. 
An apparatus (10) as claimed in claim 2, or as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 
5, when dependent on claim 2, characterised in that said bin means (13) includes an envelope 

positioning member (18) attached to a wall thereof for aligning envelopes (30) within said bin 
means (13).  

 
An apparatus (10) as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that said envelope 
positioning member (18) includes a frictioned surface (19) adjacent the point at which said picker 

means (20) contacts the crease between the body of the bottommost envelope (30) in said bin 
means (13) and the flap of the envelope (30). 
An apparatus (10) as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised by a 
removable cassette transport (50) including baffle means (52) for guiding envelopes (30) removed 

from said bin means (13) by said picker means (20) to a predetermined position and a scuffer roller 
(55) for side registering the envelopes (30) against a registration member (51). 
An apparatus (10) as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that said cassette 
transport (50) includes pivot means (40) for ensuring predetermined location of envelopes (30) 

during oscillation of said picker means (20). 
An apparatus (10) as claimed in claim 8 or claim 9, characterised in that said 
cassette transport (50) includes sensor means downstream of said scuffer roller (55) and adapted 

to be actuated by envelopes (30) transported by said scuffer roller (55). 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that said 
picker means (20) is adapted to change feed orientation of the envelopes (30) from long edge 

feed to short edge feed.
