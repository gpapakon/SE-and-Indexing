<ABSTRACT>
A recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) 
pharmaceutical preparation is sterilized by subjecting a 

pharmaceutical preparation of rHSA obtained by gene 
manipulation techniques packed in a container in an 

administration unit to heat treatment at 50 to 80°C for 30 
minutes or more. By the disclosed method, rHSA having high 

safety can be provided since microorganisms contaminated in 
rHSA pharmaceutical preparations die as a result of the 

sterilization method of the present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the
sterilization of various microorganisms contaminated in
pharmaceutical preparations of recombinant human serum
albumin obtained by gene manipulation techniques.In the case of human serum albumin (to be referred to
as "HSA" hereinafter) preparations derived from blood plasma,
the danger of viral contamination becomes extremely high when
the preparations produced using blood material collected from
a virus infected blood donor. To inactivate viruses that
contaminate plasma-derived pharmaceutical preparations,
several processes have been proposed, which are, for example,
a process in which a compound such as β-propiolactone is used
jointly with UV ray irradiation, a process in which a mixed
solution of an organic solvent and a surface active agent is
used, and a process in which heat treatment is employed.However, joint use of a compound and UV irradiation
may possibly cause changes in the correct antigenicity of the
pharmaceutical preparation, and a drawback of using a mixed
solution of an organic solvent and a surface active agent is
that the process is limited to the inactivation of lipid-enveloped
viruses.Heat treatment is generally carried out by low 
temperature disinfection (pasteurization), which does not
spoil the quality of the pharmaceutical preparation, and is
employed in the final step of the plasma-derived HSA
pharmaceutical production process. With regard to HSA
pharmaceutical preparations, it has been reported that the
hepatitis virus can be inactivated by 10 hours of heat
treatment at 60°C (pasteurization), and the thermal stability
of albumin during heat treatment for inactivating proteases
which degrade HSA can be ensured by the addition of a
stabilizing agent, such as sodium acetyl tryptophan, a fatty
acid salt or the like (U.S. Patent No. 5,132,404). The
inactivation effect of pasteurization under the same
conditions as above has also been reported in the case of
other viruses that may possibly contaminate blood
preparations. Biological product standards prescribe that
pasteurization should be carried out at 60.0 ± 0.5°C for 10
hours or more when plasma-derived HSA is produced.On the other hand, pharmaceutical preparations of
recombinant human serum albumin (to be referred to as "rHSA"
hereinafter) obtained by gene manipulation techniques have an
extremely low possibility of causing viral contamination,
because material having a possibility of containing viruses
is not used. The possibility of causing microbial
contamination during production
