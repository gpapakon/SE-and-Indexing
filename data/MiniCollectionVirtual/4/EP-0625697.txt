weight measurements using an on-board weighing system 

comprises a plurality of sensor assemblies each 
generating a weight related electrical signal and a 

processing and display unit. Each weight related signal 
is processed in the unit using two constant values which 

are stored in the unit. The constant values are

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a weighing
system capable of being installed on board a vehicle for
providing accurate weight measurements of the vehicle
through a range of vehicle weights.The weight of a vehicle is often of crucial
importance, especially to carriers in the trucking
industry. In the trucking industry, the cost of
delivering a load for commercial purposes is assessed to
the customer according to the weight of the load and the
distance it must travel. Knowledge of load weight is
therefore necessary to ensure that the customer is
assessed the full price of transporting the load.
Weight information can also be used to optimize the load
at or near the vehicle's maximum capacity.Previously, vehicle operators have relied on
private or government-operated stationary scales or
weigh stations for load weight information. Usually,
though, the stationary scale is located inconveniently
far from the customer's loading dock. Thus, the vehicle
operator has had to rely on the customer or shipping
broker's quoted load weight or must travel, sometimes
out of his or her way, to the nearest stationary scale
for an accurate measurement. If the load weight quote
proves erroneous at a stationary scale, the vehicle
operator may have to return to the customer's loading
dock to obtain full payment. The vehicle operator's
inability to accurately determine the load weight at the
loading dock, therefore, can result in wasted operator
time, wasted vehicle travel mileage and time, and
erroneous or fraudulent freight charges.The weight of commercial cargo vehicles is also
important from the perspective of public safety and
highway maintenance. Overloading a commercial cargo
vehicle can create a hazard by reducing the vehicle's
stability and braking ability. An overloaded commercial 
cargo vehicle also causes significantly greater wear to
public highways and to the vehicle itself. Governments
therefore regulate vehicle weight by specifying a
maximum legal load limit and fining vehicle operators
for any overage. The load limit laws, however, have
been enforced using the same stationary scales relied on
by operators to determine a vehicle's loaded weight for
pricing purposes. Law enforcement agencies have even
been known to use the records of privately operated
stationary scales in enforcing the load limit laws.
Vehicle operators may therefore lack the ability to
detect non-compliance before being subject to liability
for overloading.Accordingly, an on-board weighing system offers
significant advantages over stationary
