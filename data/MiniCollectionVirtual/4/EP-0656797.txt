<ABSTRACT>
A radiation therapy apparatus, for a radiation therapy machine providing an irradiation of a tumor at 360 DEG  about the tumor within a plane, determines a distribution of charges in a conductor that would produce a potential energy field matching the desired dose to the tumor in the plane. The fluence of any given ray through the tumor may be determined by summing the charges along the ray's path. The distribution may include areas of no irradiation which may require negative fluences. Physically realizable non-negative fluences are obtained by an iterative process of adjusting an input dose map in light of the actual dose produced by the calculated fluences.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to radiation therapy
equipment for the treatment of tumors, or the like, and
specifically to a radiation therapy planning method for
calculating the necessary beam strengths, in a therapy system
for delivering multiple beams at different angles within a
plane, so as to precisely regulate the dose of radiation
within irregularly shaped zones within the patient.Medical equipment for radiation therapy treats tumorous
tissue with high energy radiation. The dose and the placement
of the dose must be accurately controlled to insure both that
the tumor receives sufficient radiation to be destroyed, and
that damage to the surrounding and adjacent non-tumorous
tissue is minimized.Internal-source radiation therapy places capsules of
radioactive material inside the patient in proximity to the
tumorous tissue. Dose and placement are accurately controlled
by the physical positioning of the isotope. However,
internal-source radiation therapy has the disadvantages of any 
surgically invasive procedure,
including discomfort to the patient and risk of infection.External-source radiation therapy uses a radiation
source that is external to the patient, typically either a
radioisotope, such as 60Co, or a high energy x-ray source,
such as a linear accelerator. The external source produces
a collimated beam directed into the patient to the tumor
site. External-source radiation therapy avoids some of the
problems of internal-source radiation therapy, but it
undesirably and necessarily irradiates a significant volume
of non-tumorous or healthy tissue in the path of the
radiation beam along with the tumorous tissue.The adverse effect of irradiating of healthy tissue may
be reduced, while maintaining a given dose of radiation in
the tumorous tissue, by projecting the external radiation
beam into the patient at a variety of "gantry" angles with
the beams converging on the tumor site. The particular
volume elements of healthy tissue, along the path of the
radiation beam are changed, reducing the total dose to each
such element of healthy tissue during the entire treatment.The irradiation of healthy tissue also may be reduced
by tightly collimating the radiation beam to the general
cross section of the tumor taken perpendicular to the axis
of the radiation beam. Numerous systems exist for producing
such a circumferential collimation, some of which use
multiple sliding shutters which, piecewise, may generate a
radio-opaque mask of arbitrary outline. As part of collimating the beam to the outline of
