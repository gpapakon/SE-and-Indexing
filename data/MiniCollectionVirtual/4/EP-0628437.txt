<ABSTRACT>
A double wishbone type suspension for suspending a carrier (10) 
for supporting a vehicle wheel (12) to be rotatable about an axis of 

rotation (12A) is constructed by an upper arm (14) extending 
substantially 

in a lateral direction of a vehicle between its inboard end (18) 
pivotably 

connected with a vehicle body (20) and its outboard end (22) pivotably 
connected with a first portion (22) of the carrier, a lower arm (16) 

having at least two inboard ends (24,26) spaced apart from one another 
in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle and pivotably connected with 

the vehicle body and an outboard end (30) pivotably connected with a 
second portion (30) of the carrier, a longitudinally 

expansible/contractible 
connection link (36) having one end (38) connected with a portion (38) 

of the 
lower arm substantially distant from the outboard end (30) thereof to be 

pivotable relative thereto about a substantially vertical axis (40) and 
another end (42) pivotably connected with a third portion (42) of the 

carrier substantially distant from the second portion (30) thereof, and a 
lateral link (60) having an inboard end (56) pivotably connected with the 

vehicle body and an outboard end (58) pivotably connected with either a 
portion (54) of the carrier substantially distant from the second portion 

(30) thereof in at least the longitudinal direction of the vehicle or the 
second end (42) of the connection link.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a double wishbone-type suspension according to the
preamble of claim 1. From the document EP-A-0 323 815 A1 a generic rear
suspension for vehicles is know. This rear suspension
comprises an upper arm pivotably connected to a wheel
support and a lower triangular structure pivotably connected
to the wheel support by a ball joint. A side portion of the
wheel support is pivotably connected to the lower triangular
structure by a connecting rod member. As another type of suspension of a vehicle such as an automobile, there
has been conventionally known a suspension comprising a carrier for
rotatably supporting a vehicle wheel, and a so-called H-type arm having
two inboard ends spaced from one another in a substantially longitudinal
direction of the vehicle and pivotably connected with the body of the
vehicle via elastic bushings and two outboard ends spaced from one
another in a substantially longitudinal direction of the vehicle and
pivotably connected with the carrier, as shown in, for example,
Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication 2-136311.Fig. 5 is a perspective view showing an example of the above-mentioned
type suspension in skeleton, wherein the suspension is
constructed as a double wishbone-type rear suspension for a vehicle
wheel. In Fig. 5, a shock absorber and a suspension spring are
omitted for the clarity of the illustration. In this figure, 10 is a
carrier for supporting a vehicle wheel 12 to be rotatable about an axis
of rotation 12A. 14 and 16 are upper and lower arms, respectively.
In the shown embodiment, the lower arm 16 is an H-type arm, while
the upper arm 14 is an I-type arm.The upper arm 14 extends substantially in a lateral direction of
the vehicle, with its inboard end being pivotably connected with a
vehicle body 20 via a joint 18 including a rubber bushing, while its
outboard end is pivotably connected with the carrier 10 via a ball joint
22. The lower arm 16 has two inboard ends spaced from one another
in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle, the two inboard ends being
connected with the vehicle body 20 via a pair of joints 24 and 26 each
including a rubber bushing to be pivotable about a common axis 28, and
two outboard ends spaced from one another in a substantially 
longitudinal direction of the vehicle, the two outboard ends being
pivotably connected with the carrier 10 via a pair of ball joints 30 and
32 to be pivotable about a common axis 34.In such a suspension, the carrier 10 is supported more stably by
the lower arm 16 pivotably
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A double wishbone-type vehicle suspension comprising:

a wheel carrier (10) for rotatably supporting a
vehicle wheel (12) about a wh
eel axis (12A);
an upper arm (14) extending substantially in a
lateral direction of the vehicle between its inboard end (18)

pivotably connected to a vehicle body (20) and its outboard end
(22) pivotably connected to an upper portion of said carrier

(10);
a lower arm (16) having an outboard end pivotably
