<CLAIMS>
A safety lock comprising a casing (1,2), wherein a first 
plate (5) is lodged, said plate being movable mounted within said casing, 

the dead bolt (4) being mounted on said first plate, which is equipped 
with a conversion element (7,8) provided for converting a handling 

command of the lock in a transversal movement of the first plate within 
the casing, said first plate being provided with a first guiding slot (11), 

characterised in that a door-knob hole (14) is lodged within the first slot 
(11) and in that said plate (5) comprises at least a second slot (19) 

wherein a connection element (16) is lodged, provided for fixing therein a 
driving rod for an adjacent lock. 
A safety lock as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the second slot is provided with at least one plummer, which extends 

substantially in parallel to the path of the dead bolt and which is provided 
for receiving said connection element when the dead bolt extends 

outside the casing. 
A safety lock as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the first plate is mounted on one side of the dead bolt and a second 

plate is mounted on the other side of the dead bolt, said first and second 
slot extending in parallel within the first and second plate. 
A safety lock as claimed in anyone of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that it comprises a first locking member, provided for 

locking at least one of the plates at the end of their travel path when the 
dead bolt extends out of the lock. 
A safety lock as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that 
said first locking member is formed by at least one stopper, lodged in a 

movable manner, within a recess provided within at least one of the 
plates, a first respectively a second part of the recess extends inside 

respectively outside the horizontal extension of the dead bolt, the first  
 

stopper being lodged within said first part when the dead bolt extends 
outside the lock, said connection element being formed by a second 

stopper. 
A safety lock as claimed in anyone of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that it comprises a second locking element provided for 

locking the spring-bolt, when the dead bolt extends outside the lock. 
A safety lock as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that 
said second locking element is formed by a recess, located at the height 

of the spring-bolt within at least one of the plates. 
A safety lock as claimed in anyone of the claims 1 to 7, 
comprising a cylinder, characterised in that said cylinder comprises a 

toothed wheel, and said conversion element being formed by a first 
toothed rack, in which the toothed wheel grips. 
A safety lock as claimed in claim 5 and 8, characterised 
in that said first stopper is mounted on a second toothed rack, placed 

downstream of the first toothed rack with respect to the dead bolt. 
A safety lock as claimed in anyone of the claims 1 to 9 
and comprising a cylinder, characterised in that the cylinder is blocked by 

a yoke, situated inside the lock. 
A safety lock as claimed in claim 10, characterised in 
that said cylinder is provided with a sleeve, mounted on its outer wall, 

said sleeve being provided with two recesses, situated on both sides of a 
central cylinder axis and inside the lock casing, when the cylinder is 

mounted on the lock, said sleeve comprising two brackets hingedly 
mounted in a basis of the sleeve and provided for penetrating into the 

recesses, when the cylinder is blocked inside the casing. 
A safety lock as claimed in claim 11, characterised in 
that the sleeve is controlled by means of a screw, which crosses the 

head end and acts on the brackets.  
 
A safety lock as claimed in one of the claims 8, 9, 10, 11 
or 12, characterised in that the spring-bolt is connected to the cylinder by 

means of a third toothed rack, placed upstream of the first toothed rack 
with respect to the dead bolt. 
A safety lock as claimed in claim 13, characterised in 
that said third toothed rack is part of a little plate, provided with a third 

slot, said little plate being provided for being moved over the length of the 
third slot in such a manner, that an end of the little plate gets housed 

behind the dead bolt, when the latter is inside said casing.
