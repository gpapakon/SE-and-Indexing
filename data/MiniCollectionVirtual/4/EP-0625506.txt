<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an amide group-containing 
diisocyanate compound, a process for 
producing the same, an amide group-containing epoxy 
resin, and a process for producing the same. It has been known that since polyamide resins 
have amide bonds wherein nitrogen atom and a carbon atom 
are bound with high polarity, a strong hydrogen bond and 
a large bond energy, these resins are excellent in heat 
resistance but low in solubility in organic solvents. 
For example, almost polyamide resins dissolved in only 
special high boiling-point polar solvents having a large 
dissolving power such as N-methyl-2-pyrrodidone. Thus, 
when such resins were used as coating resins and subjected 
to low-temperature baking wherein heat treatment 
such as drying, curing, and the like were carried out 
below the boiling point of such high boiling-point 
solvents, since the solvents were retained in the 
coating film after baking, not only coating film 
properties of the polyamide resins originally had were 
not exhibited sufficiently, but also various undesirable 
influences due to the retained solvent were generated. 
Therefore, such polyamides were only used for high-temperature 
baking wherein the high boiling-point 
solvents were completely vaporized and flown away.  Recently, in order to solve such a problem, 
there have been developed and commercially available 
copolymer-based aliphatic polyamides soluble in lower 
alcohols having low boiling points, and aliphatic 
polyamides wherein whole or a part of hydrogen atoms in 
amide bonds are substituted with alkoxymethyl groups, 
ethylol groups, etc. Since these polyamides have active 
amino groups and imino groups in the molecule, they are 
well used as a curing agent for epoxy resins for coating 
due to being able to impart properties such as heat 
resistance, moisture resistance and flexibility inherent 
to polyamides to epoxy resin cured articles. But since 
the amino group and imino group are highly reactive with 
the epoxy group and easily proceed a curing reaction 
even at room temperature, the pot life (a usable period) 
is very short even if used as a two-pack type coating 
composition. Even if the amino group and imino group 
are neutralized with various acids to form salts which 
have latent curing properties, it is impossible to 
obtain a sufficient pot life. On the other hand, polyamide resins, 
polyurethane resins and polyurea resins having amide 
groups in the molecules have a large agglomerating 
energy due to high polarity of the amide group and the
