<ABSTRACT>
A method is described for welding a pipe (5) to 
the wall (4) of a corresponding housing seat (3) 

provided in a panel (2) for a heat-exchanger element 
(1). More particularly, this method proposes 

achieving a weld which avoids the formation of empty 
interstitial spaces between the pipe (5) and wall (4) 

which could have harmful and dangerous consequences 
for the element (1) and the plants in which they are 

used. 
This object is achieved by a method which 
provides a combined heating and internal 

pressurization step for the pipe (5) according to 
values such that creep conditions of the metal from 

which the pipe is made, can be achieved; the 
deformation following this step enables the pipe (5) 

to adhere perfectly to the wall (4) in a totally 
controllable manner. 
Moreover, the controlled deformation of the pipe 
enables the aforesaid panel (2) to be stressed within 

security limits in order to preserve its structural 
integrity, thereby rendering the invention 

particularly suitable in the case of panels (2) made 
of graphite, ceramics or other fragile materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
welding the outer surface of a metal pipe and the 
wall of a pipe housing seat in a panel for a 
heat-exchanger element. In the present description and the following 
claims, the term "weld" is intended to indicate, with 
reference to the relevant national standards (UNI 
1307-1309), as well as to the definition of "weld" 
given in the "Perucca" engineering dictionary, the 
continuous connection of parts or surfaces which are 
not exclusively made of metal, obtained by the 
application of heat, with or without weld material. 
That is to say, the definition of "weld" covers both 
the joining of parts which are subject to local 
fusion and those connections which are effected by 
the melting of a so-called brazing material 
interposed between the parts to be welded, as well as 
intermediate solutions between the two, generally 
known as braze-welding.  
 It should, moreover, be added that the exchanger 
elements to which reference has been made are already 
known, in particular in the field of energy-production 
plants both of the conventional and of the 
nuclear type, in particular as elements intended for 
the removal of heat from surfaces exposed to high 
thermal flows. In fact, since these elements consist 
substantially of a panel inside which a series of 
pipes for conveying a cooling fluid is accommodated, 
their heat-exchanging capacity is high and, for this 
reason, they are used particularly in the parts of 
fusion reactors which are highly stressed thermally. Thus, it frequently occurs that the panel of 
these exchanger elements is made from a ceramic 
material or graphite or some other material which has 
good high-temperature resistance properties. It just 
matters to observe, that these elements are suitable 
for making true heat shields for walls or other parts 
making up the above plants, therefore they can be 
produced in different shapes, that is, they can be 
plate-shaped or cylindrical elements or, more 
generally, shaped according to concave or convex 
surfaces.  
 It is clear from the above that the exchanger 
elements in question should have a high heat-transmission 
capacity; in practice, this capacity is 
intimately related to the quality of the join between 
the pipes and the panel in which the pipes are 
accommodated. If this quality were not satisfactory, 
interstitial zones could be produced between pipes 
and walls of the seats in which they are 
accommodated, thereby constituting an additional 
thermal resistance to the flow of
