<ABSTRACT>
A device for monitoring and comparing present, past and ideal 
performances on an exercise machine senses a preselected set of 

factors chosen to represent the present performance of the user on 
the machine. A Central Processing Unit operates under a 

predetermined set of user controlled instructions to store the set 
of performance data for each performance of the user in its memory 

unit, and compare the present set against a stored user selected 
set of performance data representing a selected performance. It 

generates an output display signal representative of a user 
selected comparison metric therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved means for 
continuously providing information about athletic performance to a 
bicyclist during a bike ride, so that the cyclist may use this 
information to optimize his athletic performance. More 
particularly, the present invention provides means capable of 
retaining detailed information about a previous athletic 
performance in a memory device within a portable instrument and 
means for comparing in real time the previous performance with a 
new athletic performance (i.e. moment by moment while the new 
performance is in progress), and for displaying the comparative 
data to the athlete, for use in optimizing his current performance.  
 When an athlete, such as a bicyclist, is competing or 
training for athletic improvement, it is very difficult to achieve 
optimal results without some clear and objective metric of 
performance. Without such an objective metric, the athlete must 
rely on his subjective feeling of the level of effort he is 
expending. However, such feelings are very imprecise. During a hard workout, the continuous feeling of fatigue may 
lead the athlete to believe he is performing at the intended level 
of effort, only to discover at the end of the workout that his 
actual performance was quite different from his desired goal. One known method for providing objective measurements during 
an athletic performance, is to define a limited number of 
checkpoints along the route, and to keep track of how long it takes 
to reach those checkpoints by using a stopwatch. With this approach, the athlete receives occasional feedback 
about how the current performance is going, but there are still 
problems. In practice this method is too crude and cumbersome to 
be useful in all but the simplest cases, as it is impractical to 
have a large number of these checkpoints, since the athlete must 
memorize them and the corresponding times. Similarly, keeping track of the times at each checkpoint or 
even between performances, is difficult and error-prone, since the 
times keep changing as the athlete's performance improves. 
Furthermore, occasional checkpoints still do not give the athlete 
enough feedback for optimal guidance, since he must rely on the  
 
subjective feelings of exertion during the fairly long intervals 
between checkpoints as a gauge to his instantaneous performance. At present, the best available solutions to these problems are 
embodied in portable devices known as CYCLE COMPUTERS. A cycle 
computer comprises a processor with an accurate

<CLAIMS>
A user controlled display system (14) for a bicycle 
for monitoring and comparing electrical signals 

representative of the present performance of a rider 
along a course travelled, against a saved prior 

performance, comprising: 

wheel revolution detection means (11,12) associated 
with a wheel (10) of the bicycle, said wheel revolution 

detection means providing a series of signals according 
to the number of revolutions of the wheel representative 

of the distance travelled by the wheel; 
clocking means providing a plurality of timing 
signals representative of the elapsed time (22) from the 

beginning of the performance; 
input/output means (24,60) for receiving user input 
and selection data, and generating a corresponding input 

signal representative thereof, and or generating a 
display signal in response to a received output display 

signal to display data to the user; characterised by 
processor means (61) receiving as input said 
distance travelled, elapsed time and user generated input 

signals, for retrievably storing each of said distance 
travelled and elapsed time signals in a user selected 

portion of a memory means (66) as a series of detailed 
performance data signals representative of at least the 

elapsed time and distance for a plurality of points along 
the present course travelled by the user; 
said processor means operating under a predetermined 
set of user controlled instructions to store said set of 

performance data for the present performance of the rider 
in said memory means, and compare said set of performance 

data signals against a stored user selected set of 
performance data representing a saved prior performance,  

 
and generate an output display signal representative of 

a comparison metric therebetween to said input/output 
means. 
The display system as in claim 1 further including: 

sensor means associated with the bicycle for 
providing a series of signals according to the altitude 

of the bicycle and representative of the altitude; 
means for providing said altitude signals to said 
processor means (61). 
The display system as in claim 1 wherein said 
processor means (61) further includes: 


means to compare current performance data with 
previously saved data so as to determine whether the 

present performance is faster or slower than the saved 
data and to generate an output display signal 

representative of the result of such comparison to the 
input/output means (24,60) for display to the user. 
The display system as in claim 1 wherein said 
input/output means (24,60) further includes: 


means for producing an audible tone operative in 
accord with said output display signal generated by said 

processor means (61). 
The display system as in claim 1 wherein said 
input/output means (24,60) further includes: 


means (65) for connecting said processor means (61) 
and memory means (66) to an external computer system, so 

that said external computer system may read and write 
data into the areas of memory used by said processor 

means.
