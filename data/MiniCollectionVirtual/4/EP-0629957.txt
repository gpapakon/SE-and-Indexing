<ABSTRACT>
In order to decrease the number of lines of a standard bus (B1), whilst preserving the compatibility of the communication protocol, the system uses a modified bus (B2). The modification consists in removing two supply lines and in creating a line assigned to a functional signal complementary to one of the functional signals of the system. The supply potentials are regenerated from the functional signal and from the complementary signal. Application in particular to systems using I
<
2
>
C buses, such as systems using chip-card readers.
