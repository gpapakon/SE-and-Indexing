Device for transferring liquid contained in a 
receptacle by simple or accelerated gravity 

comprising, in combination : 

a tubular plug, 

equipped with an external thread (20) 
intended to cooperate with the threading of 

the threaded draining hole of the 
receptacle into which it is intended to be 

screwed in a sealed manner, 
the bore (24) of which is normally closed 
by a valve (2) fitted with a seal (3) and a 

return spring (4) in closed position, 

the valve (2) and a main part of the 
bore (24) being situated within the plug 

inside the receptacle, 
the seal (3) of the valve (2), the seat 
of which is formed by the crown-shaped 

end of the plug, being of the flat type 
and being axially linked up to the valve 

(2), 
a tubular adapter comprising : 

a central actuation member (31), in open 
position, of the valve (2) ; 
an annular joint (8) ensuring tightness 
between the tubular plug and the adapter, 
a spring (11), associated with the annular 
joint (8), and intended to push it back to 

the assembly-end of the adapter, the said 
end being fitted with an axial thrust 

bearing for the joint (8), 
and removable linkage means between the plug 
and the adapter to enable the securing of the 

said adapter to the said plug when the 
receptacle is being drained and its rapid 

removal following draining, made up of on the 
one hand, an interrupted flange (21) on the 

whole of its thickness, extending according to 
two diametrically opposed angular areas of 

less than 180Â° and, and on the other hand, two 
diametrically opposed pins (7), each of which 

is intended to be inserted behind one of the 
aforementioned flange areas (21). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the two flange areas (21) are fitted on 

the tubular plug and the two pins (7) on the 
adapter. 
Device as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that the two diametrically opposed flange 

areas (21) are interrupted by two 
diametrically opposed flat parts (25), 

suitable for use as a hold for a wrench when 
screwing or unscrewing the plug. 
Device as claimed in claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the axial thrust bearing 

provided on the assembly-end of the adapter to 
hold the seal (8) is made up of two pins (7) 

used for coupling it to the plug. 
Device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the end of the adapter 

opposed to its assembly-end is fitted with a 
connection endpiece (32) for supple tubing.
