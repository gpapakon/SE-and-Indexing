Contact pin (la) for plug connections, which is 
provided on its periphery with embossings (3, 3', 4, 4') 

which are provided at two points situated closely one 
behind the other in the longitudinal direction of the 

contact pin (la) and are in each case provided in pairs 
at two mutually opposite points on the periphery of the 

contact pin (la) and are designed as lug pairs (3, 3' and 
4, 4') which project beyond the periphery of the contact 

pin, each have a contour rising in the opposite direction 
to the insertion direction of the contact pin (la) and 

can be inserted into a receiving opening of a plastic 
body (2) and can be secured therein in a clamping manner, 

the embossings (3, 3', 4, 4') being forced into the inner 
wall of the receiving opening, characterized in that the 

lug pairs (4, 4') at one point on the contact pin (la) 
are provided on the periphery of the contact pin (la) 

such that they are offset by 90Â° with respect to the lug 
pairs (3, 3') at the other point on the contact pin (la). 
Contact pin according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the lug pairs (4, 4') which are at the rear in
