<ABSTRACT>
A method of and apparatus for continuously foaming a 
polyimide prepolymer powder which is not susceptible to heating 

by microwave energy utilize a preheated conveyor belt to heat the 
powder in contact with and adjacent the surface of the conveyor 

belt to commence the reaction and foaming of the powder as it 
enters an oven which further heats the powder by convection and 

infrared radiation to form a continuous foam bun. The conveyor 
belt is cooled as it exits the oven to cool a bottom surface of 

the foam product to enable the foam product to be removed from 
the conveyor before interior portions of the foam product have 

cooled. Foam adhering to the conveyor belt, after the product 
has been removed, is cleaned from the conveyor belt, collected 

and mixed with and used as a filler in the prepolymer powder used 
in the process. In addition the mass of the powder entering the 

oven and the density and degree of cure of the foam bun exiting 
the oven are monitored to continuously control the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to polyimide foams and in particular
to a method of and apparatus for continuously foaming a polyimide
prepolymer powder,
in particular of the type
that is not susceptible to microwave heating,
wherein the polyimide prepolymer powder is uniformly heated
throughout to form a continuous piece of foam product of
relatively uniform cell size, density and strength throughout.Many foams and especially polyimide foams are produced by
batch processes where the prepolymer powder is foamed in a closed
or open mold or by the free rise method. As discussed in U.S.
Patent 4,780,167, (columns 1 and 2), the foam produced in closed
molds tends to be very irregular and lack uniformity of cell
size, density and strength. The problems increase when attempts
are made to vary the foam product density by varying the amount
of precursor placed in the mold. While foaming product under
ambient pressure in a free rise process or in open molds produces
more uniform cell size and density, it is still difficult to
produce foam panels of controlled, varying densities for
different applications. In addition, when using batch operations
to foam polyimides, it is necessary to use masking materials or
release materials to prevent the foam from adhering to the mold
contact surfaces and/or the mold contact surfaces must be cleaned
between batches. In a free rise batch process as discussed in
U.S. patent no. 4,305,796, (column 5, line 51), the faces and all
four sides of the buns produced in the batch process normally
must be trimmed to provide the end product with smooth planer
surfaces. This results in trim or scrap losses which increase
the cost of the end product.The '167 patent further discusses the foaming of certain
resins between moving endless belts. The patent states that 
while this method of foaming is apparently effective with
polystyrene and polyurethane "this method is not applicable to
controlled density polyimide foam because of the much longer
periods at much higher temperatures required for polyimides which
require excessively long and/or very slowly moving belts
operating in a very high temperature oven."In addition, the heat transfer situation is very different
for a polyimide foam when compared to phenolic and polyurethane
foams which are formed from ingredients that are much more
reactive than the ingredients used to produce polyimide foam.
With the phenolic and polyurethane foams, the reactive
ingredients are mixed together in a mixing head and are deposited
within seconds onto the conveyor
