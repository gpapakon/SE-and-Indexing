Polarized electromagnetic relay, comprising:
 
   a base (4);
 
   a coil (1) which is fastened to the base and 

comprises a coil former (11) with a winding (12);
 
   a core (2) which axially penetrates the coil (1) 

and the two ends (21, 22) of which protrude from 
the coil former (1);
 
   at least one movable contact element (5, 6) and 

at least one stationary mating contact element 
(7, 8), which are each anchored in the base (4) 

to the side of the coil (1);
 
   an armature (3) which is arranged above the coil 

(1) and is formed by two pole laminations (31a, 
32a; 131a, 132a; 231a, 232a) situated next to one 

another in one plane, a flux lamination (34; 234) 
arranged in parallel over the pole laminations 

and a four-pole permanent magnet arrangement (33) 
which is enclosed like a layer between the pole 

laminations and the flux lamination, two unlike 
poles of the permanent magnet arrangement being 

coupled to one pole lamination each and the two 
opposite poles being coupled to the flux 

lamination, and, furthermore,
 
      two pole shoes (31, 32; 131, 132; 231, 

232), which are formed as angled 
extensions of the pole laminations (31a, 

32a; 131a, 132a; 231a, 232a), enclosing 
between them a first end (22) of the core 

(2), thereby forming operating air gaps,  
 

the armature (3) being supported in the 
vicinity of the second core end (21) in a 

manner which allows it to rotate about an 
axis which is perpendicular with respect 

to the coil axis;
 
      the flux lamination (34; 234) being 

magnetically coupled to the core (2), and 
the pole laminations (31a, 32a; 131a, 

132a; 231a, 232a) together with the 
permanent magnet arrangement (33) and the 

flux lamination (34; 234) being provided 
with a plastic encapsulation in order to 

form the integral armature (3), which 
encapsulation forms one wall (35) in each 

case at both sides of the coil (1) and at 
least one actuating lug (36) for 

actuating the movable contact element or 
the movable contact elements (5, 6). 
Relay according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
a bearing journal (16), which is perpendicular with 

respect to the coil axis and engages into a bearing 
recess (34b) in the armature (3), is moulded onto a coil 

flange (14) of the coil former (11) in the vicinity of 
the second core end (21). 
Relay according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that sliding knobs (37; 34c) are provided on the 

underside and, if appropriate, on the top side of the end 
section, opposite the bearing arrangement, of the 

armature (3), by means of which knobs sliding movement is 
made possible on the base (4) and, if appropriate, on a 

housing cap (9). 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the pole shoes (31, 32) are angled 

and offset at the ends in front of the coil in the 
direction of the axis, in order to form the operating air 

gaps with the first core end (22). 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the pole shoes (131, 132) form  

 
operating air gaps which are in each case parallel to one 

another and to the side walls, and in that the first core 
end is widened in a T-shape in order to form the 

operating air gaps (Figures 7 to 10). 
Relay according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that the pole shoes (231, 232) each form coupling 

sections (231b, 232b) to the side of and next to the 
coil, for the purpose of feeding the exciter flux back to 

the second core end. 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the flux lamination (34) is coupled 

to the second core end. 
Relay according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
the flux lamination (234) is coupled to the first core 

end (Figure 9). 
Relay according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the magnet system is insulated from 

sets of contacts (5, 6, 7, 8), which are arranged on both 
sides, by means of partitions (46; 91) which are moulded 

onto the base (4) and/or a cap (9).
