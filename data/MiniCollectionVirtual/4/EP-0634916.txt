<DESCRIPTION>
 Method and means for preventing secondary cataract.The present invention is related to the field of ophthalmology and more specifically to methods and means for preventing secondary cataract, a longter complication after extracapsular cataract extraction with or without intraocular lens implantation. A great number of intraocular lens (IOL) models have been developed and tested over the years and these as well as the techniques for implantation have been improved so that extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation are now well established procedures with a high success rate. Opacification of the posterior capsule in the optical axis is however still a significant longterm complication, reported to occur in about 50% of the cases after two to five years. This condition is often referred to as secondary cataract or after-cataract. The risk for opacification seems to be less pronounced with older patients and young age is considered to be the most significant risk factor. It is also to be noticed that even if a surgeon routinely uses a particular implantation technique and the same IOL type, the results might differ in a quite unpredictable way. Very good results with no opacification are obtained in some patients while others, operated under similar conditions, suffer from severe opacification. Prevention of opacification is accordingly of great importance in order to improve the long term outcome of cataract surgery. A number of techniques for preventing secondary cataract have been tested over the years, both with regard to the IOL as such and the technique used for surgery. One such example is the barrier ridge IOL described by Hoffer (US 4244060) . One aim of this design was to create a mechanical barrier to inhibit migration of residual lens epithelial cells and their derivatives into the optical zone behind the IOL.Secondary cataract is treated by making an opening in the opcified posterior len capsule. This opening is today usually made with a NdYag laser. A laser beam is shot through the pupil 

and the IOL and focused on the posterior lens capsule. Several complications have been observed with this method which is reported to increase the incidence of retinal detachment and cystoid macular oedema. One object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for preventing opacification in connection with extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation, by chemical modification of the posterior capsule wall in order to decrease adhesion and
