<ABSTRACT>
A furnace intended for low-pressure pyrolytic destruction of organic industrial waste comprises a substantially horizontal leakproof tubular vessel (1), a pumping unit (4) connected to the vessel via a condenser (2), means (11, 18) for introducing waste into the vessel and means of heating which consist of rectilinear electrical resistances (15) lying parallel to the axis of the vessel (1) in the proximity of the upper part of the latter, mounted bare and capable of being heated by the flow of current originating from an external source (19) to a temperature of at least 1200 DEG C. Most of the organic matter is decomposed to solid carbon and to gas or vapour, recovered in the condenser (2) or at the exit of the pumping unit (4) at the average temperature of the vessel, between 400 DEG  and 600 DEG C. The molecules which are not dissociated at this temperature are dissociated by selective absorption of the radiation wavelength of the resistances (15).

Oven for the pyrolytic destruction under reduced pressure of
organic industrial waste, comprising one leakproof tubular vessel (1), one

pumping unit (4) connected to the vessel via a condenser (2), means for
feeding (11, 10) the waste into the vessel and means for heating (15) the

said vessel, characterized in that the heating means consist of rectilinear
electric resistors (15) extended in parallel with the principal axis inside the

vessel (1) close to the wall, these resistors being installed in uninsulated
condition and capable of being raised to a temperature level of 1200Â°C, at

least, through a current flow derived from an outside source (19).
Oven according to claim 1, characterized in that the tubular
vessel is arranged with its principal axis being approximately horizontal.
Oven according to one of the claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that it comprises inside the vessel (1), thermal insulating means

consisting of a fireproof lining (16) applied to the internal surface of the
vessel (1) facing the resistors (15), and elongated reflecting screens (17)

installed between the fireproof lining (16) and the resistors (15).
Oven according to any of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the resistors (15) consist of Inconel tubes.
Oven according to any of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that it comprises a cylinder-shaped perforated hamper (13) capable of

being caused to rotate around an axis (14a) in parallel with that of the
vessel, straight below the latter.
Oven according to any of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the vessel is covered on the outside with heat-insulating cladding.
Oven according to any of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the condenser (2) is a contact-type condenser and comprises one

tower (20,21), at least, fitted with spray tips (20a, 21a) directed downwards
and supplied with pressurized water, and with one accelerating pump (23)

with an intake opening connected to the bottom section (22) of the tower
and with a discharge opening connected to a storage tank (3) for diluted

condensates. 
Oven according to any of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that the pumping unit (4) comprises, in series, one injector (40) and one

fluid ring pump (41).
