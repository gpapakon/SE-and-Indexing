<ABSTRACT>
Peptides which contain epitopes that mimic epitopes of the amino terminal propeptide of  alpha 1 Type I collagen, and antibodies which bind the epitopes, are useful in monitoring bone formation. Assays which employ the peptides and antibodies thereto are particularly useful in diagnosing and monitoring bone related disorders, such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease, among others.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for determining 
bone formation rates by measuring levels of the amino terminal 
propeptide of procollagen alpha (α)1 chain of Type I collagen. Bone formation in vertebrates is a dynamic process 
involving continuous production of bone and continuous bone 
resorption. Osteopenia is a general term used to describe any 
bone-wasting disease in which the rate of bone resorption is 
greater than the rate of bone formation. Osteoporosis results 
from a progressive net loss of skeletal bone mass due to an 
increase in bone resorption exceeding bone formation. 
Osteoporosis afflicts nearly 20 million people in the United 
States alone, and total costs from osteoporosis-related 
injuries amount to at least $7 billion annually (Barnes, 
Science 236:914 (1987)). A major difficulty in monitoring the 
disease is the lack of a specific assay to measure acute 
changes which may occur from various treatment regimens. 
There is a need to have an easy, reliable test for bone 
formation. Type I Collagen is unique to connective tissues and 
is a major component in bone, among other tissues. The normal 
synthesis and breakdown of this collagen type can be altered 
during the pathogenesis of many kinds of disease, including 
osteoporosis. Because bone is a metabolically active tissue 
throughout life, indicators of Type I collagen turnover could 
be useful as a marker in metabolic bone disease. However, the 
major means for estimating the metabolic rate of bone collagen  
 
has been to quantify the urinary excretion of 
hydroxyproline, which is derived from collagenous proteins. 
This test has proven tedious, associated with several 
sources of error, and not specific for Type I collagen. 
Azria, Calcif. Tissue Int. 45:7-11 (1989). Each Type I collagen fibre is composed of three long, 
helical polypeptide chains (α chains) that bind tightly to 
each other. Each Type I collagen polypeptide is synthesized 
as a larger procollagen molecule, containing additional 
sequences at both the amino and carboxy terminals. It 
appears that the large amino and carboxy terminal ends of 
the procollagen are important in the alignment and binding 
of the trimer. The amino and carboxy terminal propeptides 
are cleaved extracellularly by specific proteinases before 
the α chains are assembled into fibres. J. Biol. Chem. 262(28): pages 13457-13463 (1987) 
discloses that by using nondegradative isolation procedures, 
the amino-terminal propeptide of the α1 chain of type I 
collagen was isolated as a
