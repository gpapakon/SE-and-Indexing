<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for 
carrying out an immuno-agglutination assay, where agglutination 
occurs via cross-bridging of antibody molecules. GB 2 233 089 discloses a method and apparatus for 
monitoring the aggregation of particles suspended in a liquid, 
in which a sample of the liquid is subjected to ultrasound to 
promote aggregation and possible agglutination of particles, 
and then the particles are allowed to settle onto a meniscus 
of the sample. A visual inspection of the particles once 
settled on the meniscus enables a determination of whether an 
agglutination reaction has occurred: agglutinated cells lie in 
clumps distributed over the meniscus, whereas clumps of non-agglutinated 
particles dissociate and form a ring around the 
edge of the meniscus. The method and apparatus disclosed in GB 2 233 089 is 
particularly applicable to the detection of Hepatitis B virus, 
a reaction mixture being formed of a serum sample plus a 
suspension of appropriate erythrocytes coated with antibody to 
Hepatitis B surface antigen. Viral agglutination of the 
erythrocytes gives a positive test reaction. In GB 2 233 089, ultrasound is coupled via a reservoir 
into the bottom of a vertical capillary tube containing the 
sample. The arrangement is not suited to multiple-sample 
testing because the reservoir, in which the capillary tube 
stands, must be washed out and refilled for each test; also 
continuous movement of successive samples through the capillary 
tube is impractical because the ultrasonic transducer is 
positioned across one end of the capillary tube. We have now devised an improved method of and apparatus 
for carrying out an immuno-agglutination assay, which in 
particular achieves a rapid aggregation of particles. In accordance with this invention, there is provided a 
method of carrying out an immuno-agglutination assay, the 
method comprising providing a sample of liquid in which 
particles potentially susceptible to agglutination are 
suspended, containing said sample within a tube, exciting a 
tubular ultrasound transducer, which encircles said tube, to 
generate a standing wave ultrasound field within said tube, 
said standing wave field extending radially of said tube and  
 
exhibiting a progressive change in pressure amplitude radially 
within the tube, so that particles suspended in said liquid 
sample are displaced radially of the tube to aggregate at one 
or more predetermined annular regions, then terminating the 
exposure of the sample to the standing

<CLAIMS>
A method of carrying out an immuno-agglutination assay, 
the method comprising providing a sample of liquid (S2) in 

which particles potentially susceptible to agglutination are 
suspended, containing said sample within a tube (10), exciting 

a tubular ultrasound transducer (20), which encircles said tube 
(10), to generate a standing wave ultrasound field within said 

tube, said standing wave field extending radially of said tube 
and exhibiting a progressive change in pressure amplitude 

radially within the tube, so that particles suspended in said 
liquid sample (S2) are displaced radially of the tube (10) to 

aggregate at one or more predetermined annular regions, then 
terminating the exposure of the sample (S2) to the standing 

wave and allowing the particles to settle, said method further 
including the step of inspecting the particles to determine 

whether they remain aggregated together or whether they 
disperse. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, in which said step of 
inspecting the particles is carried out whilst the particles 

are settling and/or once the particles have settled. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the 
sample of liquid (S2) has a meniscus at its lower boundary 

within the tube (10), and the particles are allowed to settle 
onto said meniscus. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which said tube 
(10) is inclined to the vertical and the particles are allowed 

to settle onto the inner side surface of the tube and/or into 
a corner between the tube side surface and a meniscus of the 

sample of liquid (S2) at its lower boundary. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, in which 
said standing wave field exhibits a progressive change in 

pressure amplitude from a first region within the tube (10) to 
said predetermined annular region or regions, said 

predetermined annular region or regions being spaced inwards  
 

from the inner surface of the tube (10) but closer than said 
first region to said inner surface. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, in which 
said standing wave field exhibits a primary pressure amplitude 

maximum substantially on the axis of the tube (10) and 
successive maxima, of lower amplitude, at half wavelength 

intervals radially outwards from the tube axis. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, in which 
the tube (10) contains a plurality of said liquid samples 

(S1,S2,S3...) separated by bubbles of air or other fluid and 
the successive liquid samples are stepped, longitudinally of 

the tube (10), through the ultrasound standing wave field. 
An apparatus for carrying out an immuno-agglutination 
assay, the apparatus comprising a tube (10) for containing a 

sample of liquid (S2) in which particles potentially 
susceptible to agglutination are suspended, a tubular 

ultrasound transducer (20) positioned to encircle said tube 
(10), means (GEN) to excite said tubular ultrasound transducer 

(20) to generate a standing wave ultrasound field within said 
tube (10), said standing wave field extending radially of said 

tube and exhibiting a progressive change in pressure amplitude 
radially within the tube so that, in use of the apparatus, 

particles suspended in said liquid sample are displaced 
radially of the tube (10) to aggregate at one or more 

predetermined annular regions, and means (30,32) to inspect the 
particles to determine whether they remain aggregated or 

whether they disperse. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 8, in which the tube 
(10) is disposed vertically so that the particles will, in use

in use of the apparatus, settle onto an inner side surface of  
 

the tube and/or into a corner between said inner side surface 
and a meniscus at a lower boundary of the liquid sample (S2). 
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 10, 
arranged so that, in use, said standing wave field exhibits a 

primary pressure amplitude maximum substantially on the axis 
of the tube (10), and successive maxima, of lower amplitude, 

at half-wavelength intervals radially outwards from the tube 
axis.
