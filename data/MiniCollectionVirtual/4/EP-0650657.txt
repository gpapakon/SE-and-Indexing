<ABSTRACT>
A method of etching, plating or applying solder to a substrate by the steps of: (A) forming a patterned image of a cured resist material upon the substrate, and (B) etching, plating or applying solder to portions of the substrate not protected by the resist, in which method the patterned resist image is formed from a liquid coating comprising: (i) water as a liquid carrier; (ii) a curable component, affording a film-forming material on curing, dispersed or emulsified in the water; and (iii) a flexibilising agent comprising an elastomeric polymer (or precursor therefor), dispersed or emulsified in the water.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TREATMENT OF SUBSTRATESThis invention is concerned with improvements in and relating to the treatment of substrates. The invention is particularly concerned with the use of curable coating compositions especially, but not exclusively, for use in the manufacture of printed circuit boards and the like.Curable compositions are widely used in the electronics industry, in the manufacture of printed circuit boards and the like, as so-called "resists", that is compositions which are applied in patterned form to a substrate to facilitate and define the area of operation of, subsequent processes such as plating, etching, the application of solder etc. The composition may be applied to the substrate in patterned form by a suitable printing process, especially a screen printing process, and then cured on the substrate. Alternatively, a so-called "photoresist" may be employed, that is a photocurable composition which is applied over the surface of the substrate, imagewise exposed to appropriate radiation through a patterned mask to cure portions of the resist exposed to the radiation, and later "developed" (by removal of uncured portions of the material) to form a patterned image of cured material upon the substrate. 

 Photocurable compositions generally comprise a photocurable material, that is a material capable of curing or polymerising upon exposure to the electromagnetic radiation, typically an ethylenically unsaturated or polyethylenically unsaturated material. Where, as is most common, curing is designed to be effected by exposure to ultraviolet light, the composition will also generally comprise a photosensitizer or photoinitiator, for initiating curing or polymerisation of the photosensitive material.In the past, the substrates upon which printed circuits were formed were relatively rigid, e.g. took the form of phenolic laminate boards. More recently, however, there have come into use flexible substrates, such as those made of polyimide resins. Clearly, for better compatibility between resin and flexible substrate, the latter, when cured, should, to some extent, be flexible. It has been proposed to improve the flexibility of cured resins by including a flexibilising material in the resist formulation.It has now been found, in accordance with the present invention, that a flexibilising component may be readily and effectively included in a coating composition, such as a resist composition, in the form of an emulsion or dispersion of the material in water, which water also serves as a carrier for the

CLAIMS :
1. A method of etching, plating or applying solder to a substrate by the steps of:
(A) forming a patterned image of a cured resist material upon the substrate, and
(B) etching, plating or applying solder to portions of the substrate not protected by the resist,
in which method the patterned resist image is formed from a liquid coating comprising : -
(i) water as a liquid carrier;
(ii) a curable component, affording a film-forming material on curing, dispersed or emulsified in the water; and
(iii) a flexibilising agent comprising an elastomeric polymer (or precursor therefor) , dispersed or emulsified in the water.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the patterned resist image is formed from a liquid photocurable coating compositon by the steps of: 


(a) forming a layer of the composition upon the substrate;
(b) imagewise exposing the layer to radiation whereby to cure portions of the layer exposed to that radiation; and
(c) developing the exposed layer by removing unexposed portion of the layer with an appropriate solvent.
