<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to trocars
for inserting an access tube or "cannula" through an
abdominal wall, and more particularly to a reusable
trocar having an easily replaceable obturator portion.An increasing number of abdominal surgical
procedures are being performed with laparoscopic
techniques in order to avoid a large skin incision.
Typically in laparoscopic surgery, a special needle,
similar to the pneumoneedle described in U.S. Patent
No. 4,808,168 to Warring, is inserted through the skin,
and used to inflate the abdominal cavity with an
insufflating gas such as CO2. Once the abdomen is
adequately dilated, the needle is removed and a rigid
access tube or cannula with a larger diameter (for
example 10 or 11 mm) is passed through the skin in the
same location.The access tube provides access for
laparoscopes or other laparoscopic surgical tools such
as the stapler described in U.S. Patent No. 5,040,715
or the surgical clip appliers described in U.S. Patent
No.'s 5,084,057 and 5,100,420. To drive the access
tube through the skin, the surgeon places a trocar
obturator in the lumen of the access tube to provide a
sharp, leading edge for cutting tissue.The art is replete with trocar devices such
as those shown in U.S. Patent No's. 4,535,773,
4,601,710, 4,654,030, 4,902,280, and 4,931,042. A
prior art trocar device typically comprises a sharp
point for penetrating the skin, surrounded by a
spring-loaded protective sleeve. As these trocar 
devices are urged through the skin, friction with the
skin causes the protective sleeve to slide proximally
(rearwardly). After the access tube has penetrated
through the skin, there is no longer friction between
the protective sleeve and the skin, and the spring is
designed to urge the protective sleeve distally
(forwardly) to cover the sharp point, locking the
protective sleeve in position to reduce the risk of
accidental puncture of the underlying organs.Two typical "safety" trocars currently
available are known as the "Auto Suture Surgiport" T.M.
(generally available from U.S. Surgical of Norwalk,
Connecticut) and the "Endopath" T.M. (generally
available from Ethicon of Somerville, N.J.). Trocars
similar, but not identical to these are shown in U.S.
Patents 5,066,288 and 5,030,206. These types of prior
art trocar devices are generally used during a surgical
procedure and then disposed of after the surgical
procedure is completed. Such prior art trocars tend to
be expensive, particularly when a "safety" mechanism is
included. Also, the presence of a "shield"
