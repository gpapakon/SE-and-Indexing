<ABSTRACT>
In a feeding installation for delivery of feed, in particular liquid feed or wet feed, to a plurality of feeding positions (4, 5), with at least one conveyor path (1) which can be loaded with the feed and along which feed outlets (2) are arranged which can be opened in a controlled manner for delivering feed portions to the feeding positions (4, 5), and in which arrangements are provided for adding small quantities of feed additives, for example medicaments, trace elements or vitamins, to the feed which is to be delivered at selectable feeding positions (4, 5), at least one separate admission line (6, 19 - 21) is provided, which is, however, common to all the selectable feeding positions (4, 5) and can be loaded from at least one storage container (7, 11, 12) and has outlets (9) which can be opened in a controlled manner for individual incorporation of the small quantities of feed additives between feed outlet (2) and feeding position (4, 5). In order to prevent the delivery of feed additive residues to delivery positions which have not been selected for this additive, cleaning arrangements are used for cleaning the admission line, namely arrangements for flushing with liquid, with compressed air, or with compressed air into which a liquid can be sprayed.

A feeding installation for delivering fodder, more 
particularly liquid or moist fodder, to a number of 

feeding stations (4, 5), comprising at least one 
conveying path (1) for loading with fodder and along 

which controlled-release fodder outlets (2) for 
delivering portions of fodder to the feeding stations 

(4, 5) are disposed, means (6 - 23) being provided for 
supplying small quantities of fodder additives, such as 

drugs, trace elements or vitamins, to the fodder for 
delivery at selectable feeding stations (4, 5), 

characterised in that the means (6 - 23) for supplying 
fodder additives comprise at least one supply pipe (6, 

19 - 21) which is separate but common to the selectable 
feeding stations (4, 5) and exclusively intended for 

supplying the fodder additives and is adapted to be 
loaded with additives from at least one storage 

container (7, 11, 12) and is provided at the selectable 
feeding stations (4, 5) with controlled-release outlets 

(9) for individually introducing the small quantities 
of fodder additives between the outlet (2) of the 

conveying path (1) and the selected feeding station (4, 
5), and in that the supply pipe is provided with 

cleaning means, i.e. means for rinsing or scavenging 
with liquid, compressed air or compressed air into 

which a liquid can be sprayed, for preventing delivery 
of residues of fodder additives to delivery stations 

not intended for such additives. 
A feeding installation according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the outlets (9) of the supply  

 
pipe (6) are provid
ed with metering valves controlled 
by a central unit. 
A feeding installation according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the supply pipe (19, 20, 21) can 

be supplied with a neutral conveying medium, more 
particularly air or water, under excess pressure, and 

small quantities of fodder additives can be introduced 
into the supply pipe from one or more storage 

containers (11 - 13) through metering means (14, 15, 
16, 18) separately to the individual delivery stations 

(4, 5). 
A feeding installation according to claim 3, 
characterised in that when compressed air is used as 

the conveying medium, the supply pipe (20, 21) can be 
supplied with compressed air optionally from one or the 

other or from both ends, via shut-off means (22, 23).
