<ABSTRACT>
A self-locking attachment buckle 10 for a strap 16 includes a pair of rings 12, 14 which are superposed in the form of rectangular frames having two openings 18, 20 of different size, and a transverse slot 32 for the strap 16 to pass through. The buckle 10 is located either in a blocking position after the application of a locking (gripping) force or in a position for unblocking by means of a voluntary unlocking action, giving rise to sliding of the second ring 14, and the increase in the zone of passage of the strap 16 in the slot 32 after rocking of the buckle 10. The outer edge of the crosspiece 40 of the second ring 14 is permanently set back from the parallel edge of the first ring 12 so as not to impede the rocking movement. Applications: speleology (caving), climbing, mountaineering (alpine sports), construction sites.

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable self-clamping loop of a strap (16) composed
of a pair of rings (12, 14) superposed according to two

parallel planes, and presenting rectangular frames of
different sizes, the larger first ring (12) comprising a

rectangular first opening (18) located under a rectangular
second opening (20) arranged in the smaller second ring

(14), in such a way as to define a transverse slot (32) for
passage of the strap (16), the slot (32) being arranged

between one of the external edges (34) of the second ring
(14) and the corresponding large side (24) of the first

opening (18) of the first ring (12), the loop (10) being
either in a locked position of the strap (16) in the slot

(32) following application of a clamping force or in an
unlocked position due to a voluntary unlocking action

causing sliding of the second ring (14) and an increase of
the passage zone in the slot (32) after a rocking movement

of the loop (10),

the second external edge (44) extending along said cross-piece
(40) of the second ring (14), and being located

appreciably away from the first parallel edge (46),
one of the ends (16a) of the strap (16) passing through
the two openings of the rings (12, 14) forming a closed turn

(29), and the other end (16b) of the strap passing through
said transverse slot (32),

characterized in that :
the distance (X2) between the internal large side (26) and
the external edge (34) of the second ring (14) is greater

than the size (L1) of the first opening (18) of the first
ring (12) to ensure self-clamping of the strap in the slot

(32) of the loop,
the width (e2) of the first cross-piece (40) of the second
ring (14) opposite the slot (32) is smaller than the width

(e1) of the bottom branch (42) of the first ring (12), 
the first edge (46) of said branch (42) is arranged as a
pivoting axis when the rocking movement of the loop (10) to

the unlocked position takes place, during said movement,
unlocking by rocking of the loop (10) being achieved by

exerting a raising effort on the first ring (12), the second
external edge (44) being located appreciably away from the

first edge (46), and the turn (29) being closed by a seam
(30),
the external width (Y2) of the second ring (14) is smaller
than the distance (Y1) arranged between the external edge

(46) and the internal large side (24) of the first ring (12)
to enable the withdrawal movement of the second ring (14)

causing widening of the slot (32) following unlocking,
the distance (X3) between the internal large side (28) and
the external edge (44) of the second ring (14) is greater

than the width (e1) of the branch (42), plus twice the
thickness of the strap.
The adjustable loop according to claim 1, characterized
in that the second cross-piece (38) located between the slot

(32) and the second opening (20) of the second ring (14)
comprises a convex curved part.
The adjustable loop according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that th
e large sides (22, 24 ; 26, 28)
parallel two by two of each rectangular opening (18, 20) are

equal and extend according to the transverse direction of
the strap (16), that the longitudinal distance (L1) between

the large sides (22, 24) of the first opening (18) is
greater than the distance (L2) arranged between the

corresponding large sides (26, 28) of the second opening
(20), and that the width of the strap (16) is appreciably

less than said large sides 
The adjustable loop according to one of the claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the rings (12, 14) of the loop (10)

are achieved by cutting a sheet plate made of metallic
material, notably steel.
The adjustable loop according to one of the claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the loop (10) is made of a plastic

material.
