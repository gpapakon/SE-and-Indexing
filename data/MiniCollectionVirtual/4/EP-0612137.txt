<ABSTRACT>
A grommet (40) is coupled to one side of a brush 
holder stay (20). When the brush holder stay (20) is housed 

in an end bracket (11), a projection (42,look at Fig.4) projecting from 
the grommet (40) is engaged with a groove (14) which is 

provided in the end bracket (11). A screw insertion hole 
(25) opened at a position opposite to the grommet (40) of 

the brush holder stay (20) is adjusted with a threaded 
hole (16) of a boss portion formed in the end bracket (11), 

whereby a screw (34) is inserted therethrough and screwed 
in the threaded hole (16). The brush holder stay (20) is 

fixed to the end bracket (11) by one piece of screw (34) and 
the grommet (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a brush device, and more 
particularly to improvements in fixing construction of a 
brush holder stay, which is effective, for example, in 
use for a driving motor in a wiper driving system. From EP-A-359 603 there is known a brush device for an electric 
motor said brush device comprising a motor housing part; a brush 
holder stay disposed in said motor housing part for mounting 
thereon brush holders, said stay being constructed to be fixed 
to said motor housing part by more than one screw and has an 
engaging filet which is formed in the brush holder stay radially 
outwardly of the commutator insertion hole. The stay has a 
commutator insertion hole. Furtheron there is provided a grommet 
for inserting lead wires therethrough, said grommet being coupled 
to said brush holder stay. The workability during the assembly 
of the motor is improved thereby. In this driving motor for a wiper driving 
system, the brush 
device is provided on the side of an end bracket which 
constitutes a part of a motor housing, and the brush 
device comprises the brush holder stay disposed around the 
commutator and fixed to the end bracket. At least a pair 
of brush holders are radially disposed on and fixed to the 
stay toward the center of the commutator. Brushes are 
slidably housed in the brush holders respectively and the 
brushes being in sliding contact with the commutator 
under biasing forces of brush springs. The grommet is provided 
with lead wires being inserted therethrough and the wires 
supplying electricity to the brushes. In the above-described conventional brush device, 
such a construction is generally adopted, as a fixing 
construction of the brush holder stay to the end  
  
 
bracket, that a pair of threaded holes are formed in the 
end bracket at a phase difference of 180°, a pair of 
screw insertion holes are opened in the brush holder 
stay at a phase difference of 180°, and two screws are 
inserted through the screw insertion holes and screwed 
into the threaded holes respectively, so that the brush 
holder stay can be fixed to the motor housing. However, in the fixing construction of the brush 
holder stay to the end bracket by two screws, it is 
difficult to simultaneously adjust the respective 
positions of the two screw insertion holes of the brush 
holder stay and the threaded holes of the end bracket. 
Further, it is difficult to insert two screws through 
both of the screw insertion holes and then screw them 
into both of the threaded holes respectively, thereby

A brush device for an electric motor said brush device 
comprising: 


a motor housing part (11); 
a brush holder stay (20) disposed in said motor housing 
part (11) for mounting thereon brush holders (27), said stay 

(20) being constructed to be fixed to said motor housing 
part (11) by a single screw (34) and having a commutator 

insertion hole (21); 
a grommet (40) for inserting lead wires (33) therethrough, 
said grommet (40) being coupled to said brush 

holder stay (20); 
a recessed portion (22) formed in said brush holder 
stay (20) directed radially outwardly of said commutator 

insertion hole (21) for coupling with said grommet (40); 
a screw insertion hole (25) opened in said brush holder 
stay (20) radially outwardly of said commutator insertion 

hole (21) and substantially on the opposite side of said 
commutator insertion hole from said recessed portion (22); 
a grommet insertion hole (13) formed in said housing 
part (11) adjacent said recessed portion (22) of said brush 

holder stay (20) and couplingly receiving a portion of said 
grommet (40); and 
a threaded hole (16) formed in said housing part (11) 
adjacent said screw hole of said brush holder stay (20), 
said single screw (34) being screwed into said threaded 
hole (16) through said screw insertion hole (25), so that 

said brush holder stay (20) is fixed thereby to said housing 
part (11). 
A brush device as set forth in claim 1, wherein a coupling 
groove (43) is formed at one end on a side wall of the 

grommet (40), and the grommet (40) is secured to the
