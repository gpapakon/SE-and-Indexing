<ABSTRACT>
A container for a strip (12) of light-sensitive material includes an elongated opening for 
withdrawing the material from the container. Strips (22) of light-locking material are 

provided on both sides of the opening, the strips being made from a napped and sheared 
woven fabric (12, 14). The fabric is dyed, dried, napped, sheared and heat set prior to 

preparation of the strips. A method of producing such a light-locking material is taught 
which includes steps of passing the woven fabric multiple times through napping and 

shearing operations to increase the pile density.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to containers for light-sensitive strip or sheet materials. More
particularly, the invention is concerned with such containers having an elongated opening
through which the strip or sheet material may be withdrawn, with a strip of light-locking
material on each side of the opening for preventing visible light from entering the container.
The invention also relates to a method for making a light-lock material for such containers.Containers for light-sensitive strip or sheet materials, especially those for photographic
films and papers, may be classified into two groups; that is, those for sheet film or paper and
those for roll or scroll film or paper. Such containers commonly comprise an elongated
opening or slit through which the strip or sheet material is withdrawn from or returned to
the container. To prevent visible light from entering the container and prematurely
exposing the light-sensitive material, light-locking or light-shielding members long have been
provided on either side of the opening, between which the material is drawn. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate one known type of photographic film container which includes
such light-locking members. A spool 10 comprises a central core, not illustrated, on which
is wound a strip 12 of photographic film. Spool 10 includes a pair of end flanges 14 from
which extend hollow axial hubs 16. A preformed metal shell 18 comprises a pair of axially
extending lips 20c, 20t between which an elongated opening or slit is defined in the
completed container, through which strip 12 is withdrawn from or wound back into the
container in use by the consumer. These axially extending lips are different in geometry,
as shown in Figure 2, lip 20c being folded or crimped back on itself and lip 20t being
essentially tangent to the cylindrical preformed shell 18. Typically, preformed shell 18 has
been formed from a substantially flat rectangular blank, not illustrated, on which lips 20c,
20t previously have been formed. To prevent leakage of light into the container, the
opposed inner faces of lips 20c, 20t are covered in the familiar manner with by strips 22 of
light-locking material such as woven or knit black velvet which gently but firmly engages the
surfaces of the film and prevents light leakage into the container. Such light locking
materials have been made from various fabrics and are sometimes called teremp cloths.
The fabrics typically have been dyed black to improve their imperviousness to visible light
and have been made fairly soft or flexible
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A container for enclosing a strip or sheet of
light sensitive material (12), the container

including an elongated opening
for withdrawing said light-sensitive material from said container,

said opening having a pair of opposed inner faces (20c,20t) ;
and a strip of woven light-locking material (22)

attached to each of said inner faces, said woven light locking material having a pile (34) to prevent light from entering said container and exposing said light-sensitive material (12),

characterized by:

said woven light-locking material (22) being a
napped and sheared fabric (28) having weft yarn

floats (33) with fibers raised therefrom by napping and shearing said floats in order to form said pile.
The container of Claim 1, wherein said light-locking
material (22) is a six shaft filling face

satin weave fabric (28).
The container of either one of Claims 1 and 2,
wherein said light-locking material (22) further comprises

warp yarns (30) of substantially 100% polyester.
The container of Claim 3, wherein said yarns (30)
are solution dyed.
The container of any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein
said light-locking material (22) further comprises yarns

(30,32) of spun, staple length yarn.
The container of Claim 1, wherein said opening has
a width between said opposed inner faces and said 

light-locking material (22) requires a peak
compression force in the range of 7.35 x 10
4
 to
55.12 x 10
4
 N/m
2
 (10.67 to 80 lbs/in
2
) to compress
an area of said light-locking material (22)

comparable in size to an area of contact between
said strips (22) attached to said inner faces,

until said area has a compressed thickness of at
most one half of said width of said opening.
The container of Claim 1, wherein said compressed
thickness is 35 to 45% of said width of said

opening.
The container of Claim 1, wherein said strips of
light-locking material (22) are compressed into

contact in an area with a first width in a
direction of withdrawing said light-sensitive

material (12) and said opening has a second width
between said opposed inner faces; and said light-locking

material (22) requires compression to a

strip along a path having a component in a

direction of said first width.
The container of Claim 1, wherein said strips of
light-locking material (22) are compressed into
