<ABSTRACT>
A central lighting system for providing light to locations remote from 
the light source includes first and second ellipsoidally shaped reflector 

members (102,104) joined so as to substantially surround the light 
source (12). The 

reflector members collect the light output and focus it onto an input face 
of either a light guide (18) or a non-imaging optical coupling member 

(106,108). If the 
optical coupling member is utilized, an angle to area conversion occurs 

so as to allow light introduced at high angles to an input face of the 
optical coupler to exit the optical coupler at a smaller angle. 

The reflector 
members can also be configured so that respective second optical focal 

points can reside at the apex of the opposing reflector member thereby 
allowing for a coupling efficiency of approximately 70% or greater.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a central lighting
system and to a light collection and distribution
arrangement.Illustrative embodiments of the present invention
relate to an improved optical coupling arrangement
between a lamp and a light guide. More particularly,
an illustrative embodiment of the
present invention relates to such an improved optical coupling
arrangement which provides for a high efficiency light collecting
configuration disposed in relation to a high brightness light source thereby
providing for a larger amount of light output being available at the output
of a light guide.Significant design efforts have been directed lately to the task of
providing a centralized lighting system whereby a single source of high
intensity light could be utilized for the illumination of a number of separate
remote locations requiring specific levels of light. Such efforts have led
to proposals of central lighting systems for areas such as automotive
lighting, display lighting for merchandise for instance and for home use.
An example of such a central lighting system applicable in the automotive
field can be found in US Patent No. 4,958,263 issued to Davenport et al.
on September 18, 1990 and assigned to the same assignee as the 
present invention. The goal of this automotive lighting system as well as
any central lighting system is to achieve the most efficient light coupling
between the light source and the light distribution arrangement and then,
the most efficient delivery of the light output from the light distribution
arrangement which is typically an optical fiber, light guide or equivalent.
One example of an attempt to maximize light delivery at a particular point
can be found in French Patent No. 1,383,413 issued to Karl Storz for a
device for illuminating operating fields. This invention uses a pair of
spaced apart reflectors on either side of an incandescent light source to
collect light in a more efficient manner for use during surgical procedures.
For an automotive application or any situation where space
considerations are of significant importance in the design of a centralized
lighting system, it would be advantageous to utilize components such as
light guides, coupling elements and the actual light source which are of
such a reduced size so as to allow for reduced space requirements
thereby proving advantageous for an aerodynamically tapered
appearance of the front end of the vehicle. Specifically, for a central
lighting system to be acceptable from an economical point of view, the
size

<CLAIMS>
A light collection and distribution device (30) for
collecting and coupling the light output from a light source (12) to a

remote location, the device comprising a light source (12), a first (36)
and a second (38) ellipsoidal light collecting reflector member, each

reflector member having a major axis containing the two focal points of
the associated ellipsoidal shape and a minor axis normal to the major

axis and containing the centre of the ellipsoidal shape, the first and the
second reflector members facing each other and being joined to one

another so as to co-operatively surround the light source, the two
reflectors being disposed with respect to each other so that the

respective major axes are collinear, the respective minor axes are
offset with respect to each other in the direction of the major axes and

one of the focal points of the first reflector member
coi
ncides with one of the focal points of the second reflector member,

a first (34) and a second (32) light guide, each light guide having
a light input portion disposed within the enclosure determined by the

two joined reflectors and including a light input face (42, 40) and an
output portion disposed outside the enclosure for distributing light to

one remote location,

wherein the light source is disposed at the point of coincidence
of said one of the focal points of each of the first and the second reflector

members, and the light input faces of the first and the second light
guides are respectively disposed at the other one of the focal points of each of

the first and the second reflector members.
A light collection and distribution arrangement as set forth
in claim 1 wherein such light output from the light source (12) is

introduced to said input faces at a magnification level of
approximately one.
