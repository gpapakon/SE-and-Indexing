<ABSTRACT>
In a method of milking an animal in a milking 
parlour with a robot arm arrangement (5, 6) having a robot 

arm (6) able to carry teat cups (45 to 48), starting from a 
known position of the teats, a tracking procedure for successive 

teats is performed. In this tracking procedure, the 
position of a teat relative to the robot arm (6) is updated 

by means of sensor means (51), the respective teat cup is, 
based on the updated teat position, moved below said teat by 

means of control means (18, 22, 26, 36, 40, 80 to 83), 
whereby said teat cup is moved upwardly in order to be 

connected to said teat cup.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
milking an animal in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.Such a method is known from EP-A-0 091 892. In said
document, the robot arm is brought under the animal in the same position for
different animals, whereafter with the aid of
sensor means, operable in a relatively large region, the
position of the teats should be determined and the robot arm
with all the teat cups should be moved upwardly together for
the connection of the teat cups to the teats. In order to
improve this method so that various types of cows can be
milked, according to the invention, the method is
characterized by the features of the characterizing part of
claim 1.
Before the
tracking procedure is started, the position of the teats is
determined by means of said sensor means in a searching
procedure. Thereby, in the searching procedure and in the
tracking procedure the sensor means preferably are producing a sensing
beam directed in a substantially horizontal plane.In a specific preferred method, during the searching
procedure by the sensor means, a substantially horizontal
plane is scanned to check whether a teat is located therein 
and, if not, that a substantially horizontal plane on a
somewhat higher level is scanned. When during this searching
procedure in a certain range in the vertical direction no
teat is detected by the sensor means, the scanning in successive
substantially horizontal planes is started again from
the lowest position of said range. Particularly, when during
the searching procedure said range is run over for a number
(N) of times without detecting a teat, the procedure stops
and an alarm is given. In a preferred method during the searching
procedure, an object is detected by the sensor means,
the position coordinates of the object in said horizontal
plane relative to a floating reference point, such as the
animal's rear centre, are calculated, whereafter these
position data are compared with predetermined position data
of the animal's teats relative to said reference point
supplied by an animal recognition data source and wherein the
observed object is considered as a teat when these position
data correspond with each other within certain limits. When,
during the searching procedure, all the teats of an animal
are recognized and the relevant position data are registered,
the tracking procedure may be started.In a further preferred method, in the tracking procedure a
teat cup is brought in the position determined in the searching
procedure and connected to a

<CLAIMS>
A method of milking an animal, such as a cow, in a
milking parlour with a robot arm arrangement (5, 6) having a

single robot arm (6) able to carry teat cups (45 to 48) and
being provided with sensor means (51) comprising a source of

electro-magnetic radiation, by means of which the position of
the teats of the animal relative to the robot arm (6) are

determined, and with control means (18, 22, 26, 36, 40, 80 to
83) for conveying the robot arm (6) under the animal's udder

and connecting the teat cups (45 to 48) to the teats of the
animal, characterized in that the method compr
ises
searching for teats, starting from an initial position based on stored teat position data from an animal recognition data source, and

determination of the position of the teats in pairs involving
comparison with the stored teat position data from the animal recognition

data source, whereafter for a teat a tracking procedure is
started, wherein the stored teat position data is updated with information from

said sensor means (51) and the respective teat cup, based on
the updated teat position information, is moved below said

teat by means of said control means (18, 22, 26, 36, 40, 80
to 83), whereupon said teat cup is moved upwardly and is

connected to said teat.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that in the searching procedure and in the tracking procedure 

the sensor means (51) are producing a sensing beam directed
in a substantially horizontal plane.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that during the searching procedure by the sensor means

(51), a substantially horizontal plane is scanned to check
whether a teat is located therein and, if not, that a

substantially horizontal plane on a somewhat higher level is
scanned.
A method as claimed in claim 3, characterized in
that, when during the searching procedure in a certain range

in the vertical direction no teat is detected by the sensor
means (51), the scanning in successive substantially

horizontal planes is started again from the lowest position
of said range.

procedure stops and an alarm is given.

characterized in that, when during the searching procedure an

object is detected by the sensor means (51), the position
coordinates of the object in said horizontal plane relative

to a floating reference point, such as the animal's rear
centre, are calculated, whereafter these position data are

compared with predetermined position data of the animal's
teats relative to said reference point supplied by the animal

recognition data source and wherein the observed object is
considered as a teat when these position data correspond with

each other within certain limits.
A method as claimed in claim 6, characterized in
that, when during the searching procedure all the teats of an 

animal are recognized and the relevant position data are
registered, the tracking procedure is started.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that in the tracking procedure a

teat cup is brought in the position determined in the searching
procedure and connected to a teat by an upward movement
