<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sensor for measuring the characteristics of a linear product which is very long in respect to its other dimensions, on a production machine or similar. Sensor, characterised in that it operates without contact and in that it is provided with at least one means (1) which has regions (2 and 3) of measurement with respect to an average position of the wire (filament, yarn) (4) in motion and measures the variant of the complex, morpho-dimensional characteristics and/or position of the wire (4), wherein the latter varies either by vibrational movement or by displacement induced by the mean position of the axis of advance. The invention is more particularly applicable in the measurement of characteristics of very long linear products.

Sensor for measuring the characteristics of a linear 
article of very great length compared with its other 

dimensions, on a production machine or other machine, 
characterised in that it operates without contact and in that 

it has at least one means (1) having zones (2 and 3) for 
measuring with respect to a mean position of the moving thread 

(4) and measuring the variation in the complex consisting of 
the morpho-dimensional characteristics and/or position of the 

wire (4), the latter varying either through vibratory movement 
or through induced movement of the mean position of the axis 

of movement, the measurement zones (2 and 3) each having a 
different sensitivity which is variable with respect to the 

mid-plane of the axis of the thread to be measured (4). 
Sensor according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
sensitivity of the measurement zones (2 and 3) is variable 

linearly or according to another exponential or parabolic 
mathematical function, as a function of a treatment of the 

surface or of the constituents of the zones (2 and 3) in 
themselves. 
Sensor according to any one of Claims 1 and 2,

provided with a conductive or reflective coating, the 
conduction or reflection of which varies progressively from 

one edge of a zone to the other edge. 
Sensor according to either one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the sensitivity of the measurement zones

characterised in that it is of the capacitive, inductive or 
optical type. 
Sensor according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the sensitivity of the measurement zones 

(2 and 3) is obtained by varying the geometry of the surface 
of the said zones which are defined with respect to the 

average position of the thread (4), linearly or otherwise. 
Sensor according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that its surface is in the form of a disc. 
Sensor according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that it consists, in at least one plane 

parallel to the mid-plane of the thread to be measured (4), of 
two complementary surfaces (5) separated from each other by an 

inclined slot (6). 
Sensor according to Claim 8, characterised in that its 
sensitivity is adjustable by rotation about its centre axis. 
Sensor according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that it has an excitation device (15) of the 

electrostatic, mechanical, pneumatic or sound type, producing 
a vibration of the thread (4) at a given natural frequency. 
Sensor according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that it consists of a multiplicity of 

surfaces each allowing an individual measurement and a 
combined processing, in order to give a multiple 

characterisation of the moving linear product. 
Sensor according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that it consists of two polygonal symmetrical 

surfaces (5) separated by an inclined slot (6). 
Sensor according to Claim 11, characterised in that it  
 

consists, in at least one plane parallel to the mid-plane of 
the thread to be measured (4), of two complementary surfaces 

separated from each other by an inclined slot and by a slot 
(7) which is vertical with respect to the moving linear 

product (4), so as to form four surfaces (8 to 11), which may 
be identical in diagonally opposed pairs (8, 11 and 9, 10).

consists of at least two surfaces having a separation line of 

parabolic, exponential, sine or cosine shape or derivatives 
thereof.
