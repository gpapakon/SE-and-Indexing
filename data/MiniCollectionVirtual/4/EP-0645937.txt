<ABSTRACT>
An image reproduction system having a wide field of view (WFOV) and a narrow field of view (NFOV) with almost the same line of sight, in which the display on a monitor (31) (including HUD, HMD etc.) occurs at the same scale and centred, utilising all detected image data, combined in one image, with a single detector (13). Also possible as stereo model. Rapid image sequence possible. Suitable as (FLIR) low-light-level viewer for vehicle drivers, pilots etc. with row (131) or array detector. Associated method and image recording system.

Image reproduction system with

an image acquisition device (1) which comprises an optical channel (11R; 11L) with a
narrow field of view (NFOV) and another optical channel (12R; 12L) with a wide field

of view (WFOV), with the two optical channels having almost the same line of sight
(111R, 121R; 111L, 121L);
an image processing device (2) and
an image display device (3R, 3L) which simultaneously displays image parts (31R,
32R; 31L, 32L) of both optical channels on the same scale and centers and combines

them to form one image,

characterized by the fact

that the image acquisition device (1) contains a joint detector (13) for the two optical
channels (11R, 12R, 11L, 12L) and
that the image processing device (2) comprises an image compression unit (22) for the
image data assigned to the optical channel (11R; 11L) with a narrow field of view

(NFOV).
Image reproduction system according to claim 1, with the image acquisition device (1)
being a thermal imager (FLIR).
Image reproduction system according to at least one of the claims 1 or 2, with the image
acquisition device (1) containing a scanning unit (131) and an linear detector array

(132).
Image reproduction system according to at least one of the claims 1, 2 or 3, with the
image acquisition device (1) detecting the two optical channels (11R, 12R; 11L, 12L) in

alternation.
Image reproduction system according to at least one of the claims 1 - 4, with the system
being designed for stereoscopic image acquisition and display and providing for this 

purpose two optical channels (11R, 12R; 11L, 12L) with different fields of view for
each of the two stereo channels .
Image reproduction system according to the claims 3, 4 and 5, with only one scanning
unit (131) and only one linear detector array (132) detecting in alternation the two

(stereo) times two (NFOV, WFOV) channels (11R, 12R; 11L, 12L).
Image reproduction system according to at least one of the claims 3 - 6, with only one
scanning unit (131) and with this scanning unit being located behind a beam fusion

device (M1 - M9, Ch1 - Ch3) for the different optical channels (11R, 12R; 11L, 12L) of
the different fields of view (NFOV, WFOV) or, if provided, the two stereo channels (R,

L).
Image reproduction system according to at least one of the claims 3 - 7, with the linear
detector array having as many detector elements as the total number of lines detected

overall, and with no opto-mechanical device for the generation of an interlace being
positioned in front of the linear detector array (132).
Procedure for generating an image display of a scene with a central area with enhanced
resolution and/or reduced noise and a uniform scale, in which the scene is acquired by

two optical systems (L1, L2; L3, L4) featuring almost identical lines of sight (111R,
121R; 111L, 121L) and a narrow (NFOV) and a wide (WFOV) field of view, with the

image acquired by them being supplied in alternation to an image detector (13) with a
specific number of pixels and with the images provided by the image detector (13) for

the narrow field of view (NFOV) being compressed and/or being expanded for the wide
field of view (NFOV) using all pixels covered, with the result that after this process the

images contain the scene on the same scale, and in which the two images are stored in a
first frame store (AR, AL) in such a way that only the image data provided by the

narrow field of view (NFOV) are stored for image areas which are acquired by the two
optical systems with the narrow and the wide field of view (NFOV, WFOV); in which

the image data contained in the first frame store (AR, AL) is read out in the form of
video signals and the new image signals are stored at the same time in a second frame 

store (BR, BL), with this process running in constant alternation, and in which the video
signals are output using an image display device (3R, 3L).
Procedure according to claim 9, featuring stereo acquisition and stereo reproduction
with two pairs of optical systems (R, L), two pairs of frame stores (AR, BR; AL, BL)

and two image display devices (3R, 3L), with the stereo acquisition being performed in

alternation using an image detector (13).
Use of an image reproduction system according to at least one of the claims 1 - 8 or a
procedure according to claim 9 or 10 in a vision device, in particular a night vision

device, for vehicle drivers and, in particular, for helicopter or aircraft pilots.
