Method for extinguishing a fuel depot, in 
which fuel depot tanks filled with silane stand in a 

collecting trough, characterised in that the silane 
liquid burning in the collecting trough is covered with 

CO₂ which is taken from a CO₂ unit having an 
automatically triggered activation system, and in that 

deposited above the layer of CO₂ there is a layer of 
fire-extinguishing foam which is supported by a 

perforated plate. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that CO₂ and fire-extinguishing foam are led 

simultaneously into the collecting trough. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the fire-extinguishing foam is 
not poured into the 
collecting trough until after the burning silane liquid 

has been covered with CO₂. 
Method according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the fire-extinguishing foam is introduced into the 

collecting trough by a factory fire brigade or suchlike 
by means of a fire-extinguishing-foam vehicle. 
Device for carrying out the method according 
to claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the collecting 

trough (2) is provided with a perforated plate (4) 
which is at a distance (5) from the base (6) of the 

trough and at a distance (7) from the upper edge (8) of 
the trough, in that provided beneath the perforated 

plate (4) there is a ring conduit (10) which is 
connected to a CO₂ conduit (9) and to which are 

connected a plurality of evenly distributed 
extinguishing bars (11) having exit openings or nozzles 

(13) which are directed towards the base (6) of the 
trough, in that provided above the perforated plate 

(4), in the region of the upper edge (8) of the trough, 
there is a ring conduit (15) which is connected to a 

fire-extinguishing-foam conduit (14) and to which are  
 

connected a plurality of evenly distributed foam tubes 
(16) which are opened towards the perforated plate (4). 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the CO₂ conduit (9) is connected to a stationary 

CO₂ unit (18) which is mounted outside the collecting 
trough (2). 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the fire-extinguishing-foam conduit (14) is 

connected to a fire-extinguishing-foam unit (26) which 
is mounted outside the collecting trough (2). 
Device according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the fire-extinguishing-foam unit is constructed as 

a stationary and/or mobile unit. 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the perforated plate (4) is provided with a 

perforation which prevents the passage of a fire-extinguishing 
foam, in particular of an average foam 

having an expansion ratio of between 100 and 400. 
Device according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the holes of the perforated plate (4) have a 

diameter of 5.0 to 10.0 mm. 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the perforated plate (4) is supported by a grate 

(37) on which it is possible to walk.
