<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a phase-modulated interferometer having novel control and signal conditioning. The object of achieving evaluable superimposed (heterodyne) signals in a phase-modulated interferometer without complicated control of the phase modulator is achieved according to the invention by feeding the known phase modulator (2) a sinusoidal control signal with a modulation frequency of ( omega 0) and an amplitude of ( phi 0), by performing multiplicative mixing of the superimposed signal, generated in the interferometer, from the measuring and reference arm with a sinusoidal signal which is coupled locked in phase and frequency with respect to the control signal and has a specific mixing frequency ( omega M), and by filtering out a cosine signal, used in the normal way to evaluate the phase shift, in an electronic bandpass filter (9) at the filter frequency ( omega F) of which the aggregate and differential frequencies from two harmonics of the modulation frequency ( omega 0) and the mixing frequency ( omega M) take the same values, if the amplitude ( phi 0) of the control signal fulfils the condition for a suitable working point of the phase modulator (2). The invention is applied in phase-modulated interferometers, in particular for precision length-measuring devices which preferably use a heterodyne evaluation method.
