<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processing 
apparatus for processing of photosensitive material 
such as photographic film, X-ray, or paper. Manufacturers of photographic processing 
equipment are continually striving to attain rapid and 
accurate processing of photographic materials. This 
equipment should be easily manufactured, reliable and 
economical. This involves simplifying the design 
and/or reducing the physical size of various elements 
in the processor. In typical prior art processors, a sheet of 
photosensitive material is passed through a series of 
open top chambers, each containing a quantity of a 
processing fluid, by a series of rollers generally 
centered so that the photosensitive material will pass 
into and out of each open top chamber. There are a 
number of disadvantages with respect to processors of 
this type. First, the lengthy transport path impedes 
the ability to realize high processing throughput. 
Exposing of the photosensitive material to atmospheric 
conditions between the processing chamber is generally 
not conducive to processing due to the lack of 
photochemical interaction which takes place during 
this exposure. Exposure to air can also enhance the 
breakdown of the processing chemistry. In addition, 
the photosensitive material is more susceptible to 
scratching or marring due to the stresses induced as 
the material remains in substantial contact with 
multiple sets of rollers required to transverse a 
serpentine transport path. Another problem with prior art processors is 
that each processor is typically designed to be used 
with a particular type chemistry and/or film. This 
results in a lack of common parts between processors 
due to the different requirements required of each  
 
processor. Therefore, it is necessary for 
manufacturers and/or distributors to stock a large 
variety of different parts in order to manufacture and 
repair various different type processors. Further, 
designing, redesigning, retrofitting or updating of 
processors can be quite time consuming and costly. 
Additionally, due to lack of commonalty, changing 
production lines from one type processor can require 
substantial amounts of time and money. While some attempts have been made to 
standardize components in certain processors, such as 
illustrated in US-A-4 989 028, US-A-4 994 840, 
US-A-5 059 997 and US-A-5 093 678, these devices are 
limited in their ability to be interchangeable and 
modified for different applications. An improved processor has been produced 
which is simple in
