<ABSTRACT>
A ball-point pen pertinent to use of ink having shear 
viscosity decreasing property has a joint (2). The joint (2) 

includes a valve chamber (12) which is disposed in an 
approximately middle portion of the joint with respect to 

the axial direction thereof for holding a ball (14) therein with 
play and has a ball seat (13) in the rear part thereof, a tip 

fitting hole (10) in front of the valve chamber and a conduit 
communicating with an ink reservoir. In this arrangement, 

in order to allow the ball to fit on the ball seat (13) to 
prevent ink from flowing backward when the ball-point pen 

is oriented upward and in order to surely establish an ink 
flow when oriented downward, the joint portion is 

constructed such that:
 

   the axis of the ball seat is made eccentric to the 
axis of the tip end hole and a channel is provided on one 

side of the valve chamber space;
 

   vertical ribs (15a) having different heights are provided 
in the valve chamber such that the axis of a cylindrical 

space defined by top surfaces of the ribs is made eccentric 
to the tip axis, without the axis of the ball seat made 

eccentric to the axis of the tip end hole;
 

   an edge portion defined by the tip rear hole is 
provided with a recess; or

 
   the tip rear end is cut obliquely with respect to the 

axial direction of the ball-point pen to form a slanted cut 
end.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved ball-point
pen equipped with a back leaking preventing mechanism and
in particular to an improved ball-point pen which uses a so-called
thixotropic ink (having shear viscosity decreasing
property) which has a relatively low ink viscosity as
compared to the ink used for oil type ball-point pens and
therefore is subject to flow backward and which presents
high viscosity at static state but lowers its viscosity due
to the rolling of a ball when writing to flow out.The present applicant has disclose, a back leaking
preventing mechanism in Japanese Utility Model Publication
Hei 4 No.52067 in which prevention of back leaking of ink
is effected by providing a valve chamber having a ball valve
put therein with play.This disclosure provides a plastic mouthpiece made of
a synthetic resin, which holds a ball in a valve chamber
thereof and which is provided with a required number of
projected bars so that the ball is put therein with play and
cannot slip cut. At writing, ink flows to the tip through 
channels formed between the projected bars.The plastic mouthpiece is formed by injection-molding.
In the molding, the projected bars are formed as undercut,
so that it is hard to form them with high dimensional
accuracy. Further, a troublesome treatment is needed to
allow the projected bars not to be damaged when the ball is
inserted into the chamber by pushing away the projected
bars.Moreover, this method suffers from another drawback
which arises when centrifugal treatment is effected at
manufacturing stage in order to remove bubbles mingled in
the ink filled. More specifically, when the centrifugal
operation is performed, the ball is pushed toward the
projected bar area by the centrifugal force so that the ball
is bitten and fixed by the projected bars.Conventionally known ball-point pens can be categorized
into two types, one of which is a so-called oil type ball-point
pen that uses a high viscosity ink. The other is a
so-called water type ball-point pen which includes sliver
fibers holding ink therein and an ink feeder that leads ink
from the fibers to the tip of the ball-point pen.Each type of the ball-point pens has several defects,
but the most notable defects with regard to the oil type
ball-point pen are ink-blobbing due to the high viscosity
of the ink used and low writing density. In contrast, the water type ball-point pen takes a
higher cost for materials used since the water type ball-point
pen uses sliver fibers for keeping the ink.

A ball-point pen equipped with a back leaking preventing
mechanism comprising


a joint comprising;

a valve chamber disposed in an approximately middle portion
off said joint with respect to the axial direction thereof for

chamber further having a ball valve seat in the rear part
thereof;

said joint holding a tip by said tip fitting hole and
holding an ink reservoir communicating with said conduit; and said valve seat

allowing said ball valve to fit on said ball valve seat so as to stop up said
conduit when said tip fitting hole is oriented upward, characterized by

means which allows said ball valve to be spaced
