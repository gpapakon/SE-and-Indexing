<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor chip (3) is disposed 
in a device hole (23) of a circuit substrate (2) 

equipped with an insulating flexible substrate 
material (21). Bumps (31) of the semiconductor 

chip (3) are connected by single-point bonding 
to leads (221) protruding inside the device 

hole (23) from a conductor pattern (22). The 
circuit substrate (2) includes superposition portions 

(211) of the substrate material (21) superposing 
with the semiconductor chip (3) at four 

corner portions of the device hole (23), and 
superposition portions (212) that divide each 

device hole (23) into four holes (231 to 238). 
A dummy bump (32), which is interposed between 

the circuit substrate (2) and the semiconductor 
chip (3) and secures a predetermined 

gap between them, is disposed on the face of 
the semiconductor chip (2) superposing with 

these superposition portions (211, 212), without 
being coupled to the conductor pattern (22). 

A through-hole (230) for escaping air when a 
mold material is injected from the holes (231 

to 238) is formed in the superposition portion 
(212).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device, particularly one
equipped with a structure suitable for the assembly of a relatively
large-sized semiconductor chip, and a structure suitable for the
assembly of a semiconductor chip onto a flexible circuit board that
is often used in quartz watch applications.In the assembly of a semiconductor chip onto a circuit board, such
as shown in Figure 7, a molding agent [55] is injected through a
device hole [53], after the lead [521] of the conductive pattern
[52] formed on the circuit board [51], which protrudes into the
device hole [53], is bonded to the bump [541] of the semiconductor
chip [54]. This lead [521] is usually formed downward to prevent
short-circuiting between the edge of the semiconductor chip [54]
and the conductive pattern [52].However, in this type of assembly structure, the lead [521] is bent
to a great degree, with the result of increasing the thickness of
the semiconductor device. Furthermore, during the lead-forming
process, increases in the number of leads [521] also result in
increases in the irregularity of the shape and position of each
lead. Consequently, in the assembly of a large-sized semiconductor
chip [54], these forming-related irregularities result in some of
the bumps [541] not being bonded to the leads [521]. Furthermore,
the device hole [55] must be enlarged as the size of the
semiconductor chip [54] increases, thus increasing the planar area
of the semiconductor device. For this reason, this assembly method
cannot be used in electronic instruments, such as quartz watches,
which require small size.One possible method of increasing stability against warpage, etc.,
in the assembly of a large-size semiconductor chip [54], is as
follows. Reinforcing dummy bumps, which are electrically insulated
from the internal circuit, are formed on the side of the
semiconductor chip [54]. Bonding in the additional areas made
available by these dummy bumps is used to increase the bonding
strength between the semiconductor chip [54] and the circuit board
[52]. However, the dummy bump connection used in this type of
structure also requires a forming process, and thus the above-mentioned
problems associated with the forming process cannot be
eliminated.Another assembly structure suitable for achieving thin
semiconductor device profile uses a method in which a solder bump 
[62] formed on the semiconductor chip [61] is heated under pressure and bonded with the
conductive pattern [64] of the circuit board [63], as shown in figure 8. In this type
