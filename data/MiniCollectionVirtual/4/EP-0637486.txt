<ABSTRACT>
An electric stapler comprises a cartridge and an 
electric stapler main body on which the cartridge is 

detachably mounted. The cartridge integrally including: an 
accommodating section for accommodating a plurality of staple 

sheets in multi-layered form, each of the staple sheets being 
formed by sticking straight staples together in sheet-like 

form; a staple passage connecting from a lower end of the 
accommodating section; a pusher for pushing frontward legs of 

a staple formed into a square U-shape at a front end of the 
staple passage; and a drive section, arranged at the front of 

the staple passage, for receiving the formed staple pushed by 
the pusher and driving the received formed staple in a 

direction orthogonal to the staple passage. And the electric 
stapler main body including: an attaching section for 

attaching the cartridge thereto; a staple feeder for feeding 
the staple sheets within the cartridge outside; a forming and 

driving device for sequentially forming a staple of the fed 
staple sheet from the front end of the staple sheet into a 

square U-shape and driving the formed staple out; and a 
clincher section for clinching the legs of the driven staple.

<DESCRIPTION>
The device relates to an electric stapler comprising: A 
cartridge and an electric stapler main body on which said 
cartridge is detachably mounted, said electric stapler main 
body including: an attaching section for attaching the cartridge 
thereto, a staple feeder for feeding the staple 
sheets within said cartridge outside, a forming and driving 
device for sequentially forming a staple of the fed staple 
sheet from the front end of the staple sheet into a square 
U-shape and driving the form staple out, and a clincher 
section for clinching the legs of the driven staple, and 
said cartridge integrally including an accommodating section 
for accommodating at least one sheet, being formed by 
sticking straight staples together. According to the first part of independent claim 1, the accommodating 
section accommodates a plurality of staple sheets in multi-layered 
form, each of the staple sheets being formed by 
sticking the straight staples together in sheet-like form. 
According to the first part of independent claim 2, the accommodating 
section accommodates a rolled sheet, being formed by stikking 
the straight staples together in rolled form. Such an electric stapler, 
as described in the preamble of claim 1, 
is known from EP-A-0 
475 436. Furthermore, from EP-A-0 446 055, an electric 
stapler 
according to the preamble of claim 2 
is known.  
 As shown in, e.g., Japanese Unexamined Utility Model 
Publication No. Hei. 4-54683, a conventional electric stapler 
is of such a structure as to releasably attach a cartridge to 
an electric stapler main body, the cartridge accommodating a 
plurality of staple sheets in multi-layered form and having a 
pressing spring for pressing the accommodated staple sheets 
downward from the top. The main body includes: a mechanism 
for sequentially feeding the staple sheets within the 
cartridge attached to the main body from the bottommost one; 
a forming means for forming a staple in the front end of the 
fed staple sheet into a square U-shape; and a driving means 
for driving the formed staple toward a material to be 
stapled. Such an electric stapler is, in most cases, 
incorporated into an apparatus such as a copying machine. The stapler is designed so that a jammed 
staple can be removed by opening the staple driving section 
when a staple driven out by the driving means is jammed 
inside the stapler during the stapling operation. However, 
in the case where the electric stapler is attached to a 
copying machine or the like, not only the operation of 
opening
