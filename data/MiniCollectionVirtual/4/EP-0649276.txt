<ABSTRACT>
Described are herbicidal-substance combinations consisting of (1) a heterocyclic aryloxyacetamide of general formula (I) in which Het, R1 and R2 are as defined in the description (i.e. a substance selected from groups) and (2) a prior art herbicidal substance selected from the group 2, comprising the phenyl- and benzothiazolylureas, dinitroanilines, triazines, triazinones, sulphonylureas, imidazolinones, pyridinecarboxamides and diphenyl ethers. Such combinations exhibit, at particular ratios of the components, synergistic effects and can be used as selective herbicides on various types of plant crop (e.g. wheat, barley and maize). Examples of such synergistic combinations are 5-trifluoromethyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yloxyacetic acid N-isopropyl-N-(4-fluorophenyl)-amide plus isoproturone, methabenzthiazurone or metribuzine.

<CLAIMS>
Herbicidal synergistic agents, characterised by an
effective content of an active ingredient

combination consisting of

(1) N-isopropyl-N-(4-fluorophenyl)-(5-trifluoromethyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl-oxy)-acetamide
of

the formula (I)


and
(2) 4-amino-6-tert.-butyl-3-methylthio-1,2,4-triazin-5(4H)-one
(METRIBUZINE),

0.01 to 100 parts by weight of METRIBUZINE being
used per 1 part by weight of active ingredient of

the formula (I).
Herbicidal synergistic agents according to Claim 1,
characterised in that, in the active ingredient

combination, the weight ratio of active ingredient
of the formula (I) to METRIBUZINE is between 1 : 0.1

and 1 : 30. 
Method for combating weeds, characterised in that an
active ingredient combination according to Claim 1

or 2 is allowed to act on weeds or their habitat.
Use of an active ingredient combination according to
Claim 1 or 2 for combating weeds.
Process for the preparation of herbicidal
synergistic agents, characterised in that an active

ingredient combination according to Claim 1 or 2 is
mixed with extenders and/or surface-active agents.
