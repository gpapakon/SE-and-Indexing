<ABSTRACT>
A gas chromatography system having a column comprising a 
precolumn and an analytical and also having a source of backflush 

pressure applied at the intersection of the precolumn and the 
analytical column. The split column arrangement enables the 

backflushing of high boiling point components while enabling the 

simultaneous analysis of lower boiling point components located 
in the analytical column upon the application of backflush 

pressure. This greatly reduces the cycle time of a 
chromatography system as it is unnecessary to backflush the much 

more slowly eluting, high boiling point components through the 
entire length of column and there is no need to delay 

backflushing until completion of analysis of the components of 
interest. In this manner, backflushing occurs simultaneously 

with analysis for a first reduction of cycle time, and the high 
boiling point components are backflushed through a reduced length 

of column for a second reduction of cycle time of the 
chromatography system. A thermal focusing chamber enables the 

trapping of the sample at the sample tube end closest to the 
precolumn enabling a much more concentrated sample which yields 

much broader peaks in the chromatogram.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gas chromatography system 
for increasing the speed, operational flexibility, and 
accuracy of gas chromatography procedures. Gas chromatography is a widely employed technique for the 
separation and analysis of complex mixtures of volatile organic 
and inorganic compounds. The mixture is separated into its 
components by eluting them from a column having a sorbent by 
means of a moving gas. Gas chromatography procedures can be classified into two 
major divisions: gas-liquid chromatography and gas-solid 
chromatography. Gas-liquid chromatography is presently the most 
widely employed type and incorporates a nonvolatile liquid 
sorbent coated as a thin layer on an inert support structure, 
generally a capillary tube. The moving gas phase called the 
carrier gas flows through the chromatographic analytical column. 
The analyte partitions or divides itself between the moving gas 
phase and the sorbent and moves through the column at a rate 
dependent upon the partition coefficient or solubility of the 
analyte components. Various types of analytical columns are 
employed such as tubular glass or stainless steel capillary 
tubes. In use, the analyte is introduced at the entrance end of 
the column within the moving carrier gas stream. The components 
making up the sample become separated along the column and elute 
from the exit end of the column at intervals and in 
concentrations characteristic of the properties of the analyte 
components. A detector, for example, a thermal conductivity  
 
detector or a flame ionization detector (FID) at the exit end of 
the column responds to the presence of analyte components. Upon 
combustion of the eluted material in the FID, charged species are 
formed in the flame. The flame behavior is monitored through a 
biased ion detector which, along with associated electronics, 
produces a time versus magnitude trace of the detector output. 
The trace for a complex mixture includes numerous peaks of 
varying intensity. Because individual constituents of the 
analyte produce peaks at characteristic times having magnitudes 
that are a function of the constituent concentration, much 
information is gained through an evaluation of the chromatogram. Gas chromatography systems of the type described above are 
in wide-spread use today. Although present systems provide 
excellent performance and utility, this invention seeks to 
optimize and further enhance the usefulness of the procedure. Present gas chromatography apparatus and techniques often 
require
