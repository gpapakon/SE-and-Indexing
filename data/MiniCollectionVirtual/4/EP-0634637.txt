<ABSTRACT>
A twist-lock (36) for attaching a plastics 
shell (16) of a thermal probe (18) to a structural 

member such as a plastics intake manifold (10) of an 
internal combustion engine in a socket (14) in the 

structural member. The twist-lock includes hooks (50) 
on the plastics shell (16) wh
ich traverse an annular 
shoulder (38) at the bottom of the socket (14) through 

notches (46) in the shoulder (38) when the shell (16) 
is inserted in the socket (14) and which are captured 

by the shoulder (38) when the shell (16) is rotated in 
the socket (14) from an unlocked position to a locked 

position. The twist-lock (36) further includes a lug 
(68) on the shell (16) which co-operates with a cam 

edge (70) on a resilient lip (60) around an open end 
of the socket (14) to afford tactile representation of 

the progress of the shell (16) towards, and 
achievement of, the locked position and to prevent 

reverse rotation of the shell (16) from the locked 
position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connection
assembly for attaching a plastics shell of a thermal
probe to a plastics structural member as specified in
the preamble of claim 1, and disclosed in DE-A-1 802 520.US Patent No 5046857, issued 10 September
1991, describes a thermal probe assembly having a
pre-moulded unitary one-piece plastics shell which
attaches to a structural member, e.g. a plastics
intake manifold of an internal combustion engine,
through male screw threads on the shell and female
screw threads in a socket on the manifold.
Manufacturing costs associated with fabricating male
and female plastics screw threads are relatively high.
A twist-lock according to this invention for attaching
a plastics shell of a thermal probe to a plastics
structural member such as an internal combustion
engine intake manifold is an improvement relative to
the thermal probe attachment described in the
aforesaid US Patent No 5046857.A connection assembly according to the
present invention is characterised over DE-A-1 802 520 by the features
specified in the characterising portion of claim 1.This invention is a new and improved
twist-lock for attaching a plastics shell of a thermal
probe to a plastics structural member such as an
internal combustion engine intake manifold. The
twist-lock according to this invention includes axial
retention features on a cylindrical socket in the
structural member and on the shell which co-operate
when the shell is rotated in the socket from an
unlocked position to a locked position to prevent
dislodgement of the shell from the socket, and
circumferential retention features on the socket and
on the shell which co-operate to prevent reverse 
rotation of the shell from the locked position. The
axial retention features include an annular shoulder
at the bottom of the socket and a plurality of hooks
on the shell which traverse the plane of the shoulder
through notches therein when the shell is inserted in
the socket and which are captured by the shoulder when
the shell is rotated to the locked position. The
circumferential retention features include a pair of
radial lugs on the plastics shell and an annular lip
around an open end of the socket having cam edges
therein. When the shell is manually rotated toward
the locked position, force reactions between the lugs
and ramps of the cam edges effect progressively
increasing resilient deflection of the lip and
correspondingly increasing resistance to rotation of
the shell so that an installer experiences tactile
indication of the progress of the

<CLAIMS>
A connection assembly between a structural member (10) and the thermal probe (18), the
structural member (10) having a fluid medium chamber

(12) and a cylindrical socket (14), and the thermal
probe (18) having a plastics shell (16) adapted for

disposition in said socket (14) to monitor the
temperature of a fluid medium in said fluid medium

chamber (12), characterised in that the connection
assembly is a twist-lock (36) comprising: an annular

shoulder (38) on
said socket (14), the shoulder

having an inside perimeter (44) and a circumferential
array of a plurality of notches (46) open through said

inside perimeter (44); a plurality of radial legs (48)
on said shell (16) each having thereon a hook (50) and

being arranged in an angular array around said shell
(16) corresponding to said circumferential array of

notches (46) in said annular shoulder (38) so that an
unlocked position of said shell (16) relative to said

socket (14) is defined by angular registry between
said circumferential array 
of notches (46) and said
angular array of radial legs (48); means (54,58) on

said socket (14) and on said shell (16) operative to
limit penetration of said shell (16) into said socket

(14) such that, in said unlocked position of said
shell (16), said hooks (50) are disposed in said fluid

medium chamber (12) closely adjacent the plane of a
planar surface (56) of said annular shoulder (38) so

that, when said shell (16) is manually rotated in said
socket (14) from said unlocked position to a locked

position, said planar surface (56) captures said hooks
(50) and prevents dislodgement of said shell (16) from

said socket (14); and cam and lug means (68,70) on
said shell (16) and on said socket (14) affording

tactile representation of the progress of movement of 
said shell (16) towards said locked position and of

achievement of said locked position during manual
rotation of said shell (16) from said unlocked to said

locked position and retaining said shell (16) in said
locked position.
A connection assembly according to claim
1, in which said cam and lug means includes:

a lug (68) on one of said shell (16) and said
socket (14), and a cam edge (70) on the

other of said shell (16) and said socket (14)
including a ramp (74) engageable on said lug (68)

during rotation of said shell (16) from said unlocked
to said locked position and increasingly resisting

rotation of said shell (16) towards said locked
position, and a seat (76) contiguous with said ramp

(74), which confines said lug (68) in said locked
position of said shell (16) and prevents reverse

rotation of said shell (16) from said locked position
towards said unlocked position.
A connection assembly according to claim
2, in which said

seat (76) defines a sharp discontinuity (78) in said cam edge
(70)

effecting tactile representation of achievement of
said locked position of said shell (16) when said lug

(68) traverses said sharp discontinuity (78).
A connection assembly according to claim
3, in which said cam and lug means includes:

a radially resilient lip (60) around an open
end of said socket (14) including an inside

cylindrical wall (72), and said cam edge (70) is
defined on said inside cylindrical wall (72). 
A connection assembly according to claim
4, in which said circumferential array of notches (46)

in said annular shoulder (38) is asymmetric, and said
angular array of radial legs (48) on said shell (16)

is correspondingly asymmetric so that said unlocked
position of said shell (16) relative to said socket

(14) is unique.
