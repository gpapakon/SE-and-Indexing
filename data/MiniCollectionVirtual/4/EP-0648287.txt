<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR DE-INKING PAPER AND FABRIC CLEANING BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe invention relates to a process for the re- lease of stickies (acrylic contact adhesives and polyester hotmelts) , ink (absorbing, oxidizing, evaporating, radia¬ tion cured and xerographic) , coating binders (latex) , dyes, pigments and natural organic deposits (pitch and asphalt) from surfaces which have been manufactured as a product (e.g. printed articles) or are being recycled for repro¬ cessing purposes.This invention is also directed to the prepara¬ tion of high brightness pulps and the reduction of chromo- phoric compounds from pre and post consumer products such as kraft paper etc.Description of the Prior ArtIt is known that articles can be de-inked by at least one of three ways.Dry Process for De-inking substrates It is known the use of minimal amounts of water i.e. lipophilic solvents, can be used to de-ink a substrate (1-5) .1. Dreis A.G. Paper Trade J. 143 (43) 28 (1959).2. Samuelson G.J., Lissant K.J. US Patent 3,072,521 (1963) .3. Bocci A. US Patent 3,253,976 (1966).4. E.F. Davis, R. Luce US Patent 3,058,871.According to Gross, in the case of post consumer paper products, "....pulp approaching virgin market pulp in cleanliness and brightness" can be attained.5. Gross R.B. - TAPPI, Secondary Fiber Conference, Boston, September 1974.The advantages of this system are: a) the ease with which varnish, ink, pigments, dyes, and adhesives can be separated from the substrate, b) the high yield of fiber in the case of paper, c) the minimal (dry) low volume of 

rejects generated, d) the lack of need for further treat¬ ment of the substrate or fiber prior to stock preparation for the paper machine, e) the relative cleanliness of future surfaces with which the processed fiber comes into contact and f) the simplicity, low cost and amount of equipment required. In the case of paper machine com¬ ponents and processed pulp, this process, also has inherent disadvantages among which some are a) the high cost of the solvents, b) the need for complete solvent recovery (economic, health and safety regulations) , and c) the need for paper segregation since type of solvent impacts on the brightness of the resultant pulp. Flotation De-inking of PulpIn this process, it is desirable to effectively remove the broadest range of ink particle sizes while keeping the fiber loss at an acceptable level.The flotation de-inking process is governed basically by the incoming stock and the chemistry of the solvent mixture.
