<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for forming a packaging
material having at least one film layer that interacts with a packaged product
and/or that provides a barrier between the interior and the exterior of the
package. This interactive/barrier layer, as well as a sealant layer, is formed
during an in-line process prior to final orientation of the film.A prior art method for the continuous production of polypropylene film
useful for packaging which has improved surface properties is known from EP-A-0214790.
More preferably, EP-A-0214790 discloses a continuous in-line
process of forming a multi-layer packaging film comprising the steps of:
extruding a base layer for supporting the packaging film;orienting the base layer longitudinally in the machine direction of
orientation;coating one side of the extruded oriented base layer with a film layer in
liquid form that provides a required physical packaging property;drying the coated film layer; andsubjecting the dried packaging film to a tenter process for obtaining full
orientation of the packaging film. Further, novel packaging compositions that
extend shelf life of oil-containing foods are known from WO-93/01049.A polymeric film coated in-line with polyethyleneimine, which is suitable
for subsequent off-line processing, is known from EP-A-0458147. Oil-containing foods that are packaged and stored at ambient conditions
are subject to limited shelf lives in part due to the fact that the oil therein
degrades through oxidative reactions. The shelf life of a packaged product
refers to that period of time wherein the qualities of the product are not
discernibly different from freshly made product. Over time, moisture changes
and oil degradation will adversely affect the aroma, texture, and taste of the
packaged food. Such concerns have been addressed in the past by packaging
oil-containing foods in packages that contain moisture and oxygen barrier
films, opaque films that reduce light-struck reactions, and by flushing the
package with an inert gas such as nitrogen. These measures are successful to
some degree in extending the shelf life of oil-containing packaged foods.
Inevitably some degradation of food product within a package will occur and
the measures taken to prevent oxidation, such as the use of barrier films, then
act to entrap the undesirable by-products, such as the aldehydes that impart
off-flavors associated with rancidity and that contribute to staling of the food
product.Further, recent prior art approaches to extending shelf life not

A continuous in-line process of forming a multi-layer packaging film (10)
comprising the steps of:


extruding (60) a base layer (12,62) for supporting the packaging film (10);
orienting (66) the base layer (12,62) longitudinally in the machine direction
of orientation;
coating (74) one side of the extruded oriented base layer (12,62) with a film
layer (14,76) in liquid form that provides a required physical packaging property;
drying (78) the coated film layer (14,76); and
subjecting (86) the dried packaging film (10) to a tenter process for
obtaining full orientation of the packaging film (10);

   
characterised in that
the required physical packaging property is a reduction in adverse effects
of unwanted degradation compositions generated by a product, contained within a

package created using the packaging film (10), which degrades;
the continuous in-line process further comprising the step of extruding (82)
a sealant coating layer (16,84) on the dried film layer coating (14,76) prior to the

tenter process to separate a product in said package from said film layer (14,76),
the thickness of the coating layer (16,84) being reduced by the tenter
process to increase its permeability to said degradation compositions.
A continuous in-line process as in claim 1 comprising the step of extruding
polypropylene as the base layer.
A continuous in-line process as in claim 1 or claim 2 further comprising the
steps of:


extruding a bonding layer (18,64) simultaneously with and adhering the
bonding layer (18,64) to the other side of the base layer (12,62); and
treating the one side of the base layer to prepare the base layer (12,62) to
receive and adhere the coated film layer (14,76) thereto.
A continuous in-line process as in any preceding claim
further comprising the steps of:


coating polyethyleneimine (PEI) as said film layer
(14,76) on said one side of the machine direction oriented

base layer (12,62) to form an oil degradation composition
scavenger when the packaging film (10) is used to form a

package for oil-containing products; and
forming said sealant coating layer (16,84) such that it
is permeable to said degradated composition so as to enable

said PEI to scavenge said degradated composition.
A continuous in-line process as in claim 3 wherein the
step of coating the one side of the base layer (12,62) with

a film layer (14,76) further comprises the step of coating
PVOH on the oriented base layer (12,62) as an oxygen barrier

(24).
A continuous in-line process as in claim 3 wherein the
step of coating one side of the base layer (12,62) with a

film layer (14,76) further comprises the step of coating
acrylic on the oriented base layer (12,62) as an odor

barrier (24) and a flavor improver.
A continuous in-line process as in claim 3 wherein the
step of coating the one side of the base layer (12,62) with

a film layer (14,76) further comprises the step of coating
SARAN on the oriented base layer (12,62) as an oxygen and

moisture barrier (24).
A continuous in-line process as in claim 3 wherein the
step of treating the one side of the base layer (12,62)

modified surface for better attachment of the coated film
layer (14,76) thereto.

A continuous in-line process as in any preceding claim further comprising
the step (82) of extruding the sealant layer (16,84) on the dried film layer coating

so as to have a final thickness of 0.001 to 0.0025 millimeter (4-10 gauge) after the
tenter process.
A continuous in-line process as in claim 4 further including the steps of:

coating the other side of the base layer, after the coating on said one side
