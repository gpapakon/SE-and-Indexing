<ABSTRACT>
A compressor has a movable scroll supported on a bushing 
connected to a rotary shaft via an eccentric pin. The movable 

scroll and the bushing are disposed coaxial to the eccentric 
pin to rotate together with the eccentric pin. The movable 

scroll moves along a predetermined circular path around an 
axis of the rotary shaft to closely contact a fixed scroll, 

opposed to the movable scroll at a given portion to define a 
displacable fluid pocket and compresses refrigerant gas 

introduced into the fluid pocket. The compressor comprises 
a first balance weight eccentrically supported on the 

eccentric pin for an integral rotation therewith. The first 
balance weight is arranged to generate first centrifugal 

force counteracting second centrifugal force generated in the 
movable scroll and the bushing based on the rotation of the 

movable scroll and the bushing. The first balance weight has 
a weight in a predetermined ratio to weights of the movable 

scroll and the bushing to cancel substantially 80 to 97 
percents of the second centrifugal force with the first 

centrifugal force. Thus, the movable scroll is kept to move 
along the predetermined circular path.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scroll type compressor according to the preamble of claim 1 for
use in a vehicle's air conditioning system. More
particularly, this invention relates to a mechanism for
maintaining the dynamic balance of a movable scroll and its
associated members while a compressor is running.Generally speaking, the operation of a scroll type compressor
uses the revolving movement of a movable scroll angularly
interfit with a fixed scroll inside the housing of the
compressor to compress refrigerant gas. Each of the fixed and
movable scrolls has a spiral element and a fixed end plate.
When interfit with each other, the two scrolls form gas
pockets. When the movable scroll revolves relative to the
fixed scroll, the pockets spiral with decreasing volume toward
the center of the scrolls, thereby compressing the refrigerant
gas.Operational power is transmitted to such compressors via a
rotary shaft supported by a bearing in the front of the 
compressor housing. An eccentric pin, attached to the end of
the rotary shaft, projects into the front end of the
compressor housing. A boss, formed on the front face of the
movable scroll's end plate, fits over the eccentric pin via
a bushing and a bearing. This allows the movable scroll to
rotate relative to the eccentric pin.An anti-rotation device, between the movable scroll and
pressure receiving wall of the housing on the fixed scroll
side, inhibits the movable scroll's rotation. The anti-rotation
device does however allow the movable scroll to
revolve around the axis of the rotary shaft. A balance
weight, attached to the eccentric pin, dynamically balances
the rotary shaft and movable scroll against the centrifugal
forces produced by the revolving movable scroll.In conventional compressors, both the balance weight and the
revolving movable scroll generate centrifugal forces which
tend to oppose each other. In addition to these two forces,
a compressive reactive force is generated on the movable
scroll, during the compressor's gas compression stroke. This
reactive force, in general, is not canceled by the centrifugal
force set up by the balance weight. Consequently, the
reactive force tends to be absorbed by the eccentric pin, the 
bearing and other structures supporting the movable scroll and
contributes to their deterioration.The actual weight of the balance weight also affects the
compressor's performance. Acceptable design tolerances of the
balance weight requires its weight to fall within three
percent of the combined weight of the movable
