<ABSTRACT>
A belt for a continuously variable transmission in which an

aggregate of metal rings formed by laminating a plurality of pieces of
endless metal rings support a plurality of metal blocks. When the ratio

ξ of the coefficient of friction is set to be 2.0 
>
 ξ 
>
 0.65, the amount of
change in the tension on the metal ring of the innermost position

decreases correspondingly. In particular, when the ratio ξ of the
coefficient of friction is set to be 1.0, resulting in the coefficient of

friction µ
S
 between a ring and a block being equal to the coefficient of
friction µ
SS
 between a ring and a ring, the amount of change in the
tension on all metal rings become uniform, and each metal ring

shares an amount of change in the tension which is 8% of the entire
amount. This makes it possible to decrease the amount of change in

the tension on the metal ring of the innermost position and, hence, to
increase the durability of the aggregate of metal rings as a whole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a belt for a continuously
variable transmission in which a number of metal blocks are supported
by an aggregate of metal rings formed by laminating a plurality of
pieces of endless metal rings one on another.A belt for a continuously variable transmission has been known
in Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) No. 2-22254 according to
which, in order to enhance the durability of the belt, the belt comprises
an aggregate of metal rings and metal blocks, with mesh-like
protuberances formed on the inner peripheral surfaces of the metal
rings forming the aggregate of metal rings, thereby decreasing the
coefficient of friction. A belt has also been known in Japanese Utility
Model Publication (Kokai) No. 62-97344 according to which oil
grooves are formed in the saddle surfaces of the metal blocks which
come into contact with the inner peripheral surface of a metal ring of
the innermost position of the aggregate of metal rings, thereby holding
an oil film and decreasing the coefficient of friction.In the conventional metal rings forming the aggregate of metal
rings, the innermost metal ring that comes into contact with the saddle
surfaces of the metal blocks and other metal rings (at the second
position and outer positions) are all formed into the same. However,
while the metal ring of the innermost position comes into contact with
the saddle surfaces of the metal blocks, the inner peripheral surfaces
of the other metal rings come in contact with the outer peripheral
surfaces of the in adjacent metal rings, and hence their contacting
portions have different coefficients of friction. It has been determined
by measurement that the coefficient of friction on the inner peripheral
surface of the metal ring of the innermost position that comes into
contact with the saddle surfaces of the metal blocks, is generally about
twice as great as the coefficient of friction on the inner peripheral
surface of the other metal rings. As will be described later in detail, when a metal belt wrapped
round a drive pulley and a driven pulley circulates, the tension acting
on the aggregate of metal rings of the metal belt undergoes a periodic
change. When the coefficient of friction is the same throughout the
inner peripheral surfaces of all metal rings, the tension acting on the
metal rings changes by the same amount. In practice, however, the
coefficient of friction on the inner peripheral surface of the metal ring of
the innermost position is greater than the coefficient of friction on the
inner
