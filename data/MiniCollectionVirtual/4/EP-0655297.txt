<ABSTRACT>
A tool (210) for fining/polishing an ophthalmic lens (150) has a 
spindle (155) and a pliant 

casing containing a conformable filler connected to the spindle (155) 
for rotation 

therewith. A pliant pad (260) adhered to the casing has a plurality of 
slots (265,267) extending 

from its perimeter toward its center defining a plurality of fingers 
(263) which are 

contoured to the surface of the lens (150) by the filler. 
Preferably, the lens (150) is rotated about a vertical fixed axis 
substantially 

transverse to the lens (150) and the tool (210) is rotated about a fixed 
axis intersecting the 

lens (150) and substantially normal to a surface of the lens (150) 
to be fined/polished with the 

tool (210) disposed above the lens (150). The axis of the horizontal 
displacement of the tool (210) 

can be selectively varied in relation to the lens (150) axis. The angular 
disposition of the 

tool axis in relation to the lens axis can be selectively varied. The radial 
displacement of the tool (210) in relation to the lens (150) along the 

tool axis can be 
selectively varied to bring the pad (260) into and out of abutment with 

the surface of the 
lens and to vary the pressure exerted on surface of the lens by the tool.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to processes and equipment for fining and
polishing ophthalmic lenses and more particularly concerns conformal tools and
the processes and apparata associated in the operation thereof.The ability to accurately grind ophthalmic lenses to asymmetrical geometries
specifically suited to the individual is relatively new in the ophthalmic lens industry.
As a result, little work has been done in the development of fining and polishing
tools to increase the accuracy of the fining/polishing operation.In the past, fining/polishing tools provided a global conformance to the lens.
That is, a separate tool was used for every possible contour of lens and, for each
lens, the proper tool had to be selected and mounted on the fining/polishing
apparatus. However, the recent development of more accurate lens surfacing
equipment mandates improvement in the fining/polishing equipment since presently
known fining/polishing equipment would damage the accurate geometries made
possible by the new equipment. With the advent of improved lens conforming
equipment, modern lenses exhibit wide variations in face curvature. For example,
in aspheric lenses, in the progression in length of radius to the curvature of the
lens face, the radius to the extremity of the lens is normally greater than the
radius to the center of the lens so that the lens flattens towards its extremities.
However, in modern lenses, the progression may be decreasing and/or increasing
so that the face of the lens might change from a convex to a concave and back
to a convex condition. Fining/polishing such a lens with presently known
equipment generally results in the loss of the correct geometry of the lens.
Furthermore, while spherical and aspherical lenses are generally rotationally
symmetrical, progressive and toric lenses can now be ground which do not meet
this condition. While some work has been done in the development of conformal 
tools which can be used to fine/polish a variety of symmetrical, spherical and
aspherical lenses, no equipment has been presently developed which will permit
a single or minimal number of fining/polishing tools to conform to all contours of
lenses including toric lenses.While some conformal tool development work has been done, no such tool
is presently available which is not progressively incremented. That is,
conformance is accomplished in incremental diopter ranges so that the tool does
not accurately conform progressively at any position of a lens contour. Thus, the
fining/polishing process
