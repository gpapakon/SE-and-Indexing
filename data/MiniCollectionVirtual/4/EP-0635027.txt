<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the treatment or
prevention of inflammatory bowel disease, whether caused
by bacteria, viruses and/or other infective agents,
opportunistic infections (which may be consequent on an
immunodepressed state, for example resulting from cancer
or therapy, particularly cytotoxic drug therapy or
radiotherapy) autoimmmunity or otherwise. The invention
also relates to pharmaceutical compositions useful in
such treatment and/or prevention and to certain active
peptides per se.Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic
inflammatory condition that fulfils some of the criteria
of an autoimmune disease (Snook, Gut31 961-963 (1990).
Inflammation and tissue damage involves the recruitment
and activation of neutrophils, macrophages and
lymphocytes (MacDermott et al, Adv. Immunol.42 285-328
(1998) which generate cytokines and proinflammatory
molecules such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes
(MacDermott, Mt. Sinai J. Med.57 273-278 (1990). As a
result of chronic activation of immunocompetent cells,
IL-1, IL-6 (Starter, Immunol. Res. 10 465-471 (1991);
Fiocchi, Immunol. Res. 10 239-246 (1991) and TNF-α
(MacDermott, Mt. Sinai J. Med. 57 273-278 (1990) are all
elevated in IBD patients.Drugs used to treat IBD include anti-inflammatory agents
such as sulphasalazine (5-ASA), corticosteroids,
cyclosporin A and azathioprine (Hanauer, Scand. J.
Gastroenterol.25 (Suppl. 175) 97-106 (1990); Peppercorn,
Annal. Intern. Med.112 50-60 (1990). Experimentally,
anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies have been used to
successfully treat ulcerative colitis (Emmrich et al
Lancet338 570-571 (1991). Marcusson and Wetterberg (1989), Acta Derm. Venereol.,
69(1), 86-8 describes the use of peptide T in the
treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.WO-A-89/12067 discloses that peptides which inhibit
binding of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to receptor
sites on the cell surface have been shown to be useful as
agents for treatment of psoriasis and neuropsychiatric
disorders, including memory deficit and mood disorders.FR-A-2603107 discloses compositions comprising a
therapeutically effective dose of a monoclonal antibody
which reacts with one or more neutralising regions of
HIV, or a plurality of blocking peptides capable of
attenuating HIV infection and/or monoclonal antibodies
which react with the epitopes of such peptides; and a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions
can be used to treat HIV infection.WO-A-92/19257 discloses a method of treating chronic
fatigue syndrome not associated with an HIV
