<ABSTRACT>
A keypad scanner for a keypad having a plurality of 
keys which may be pressed into a down state includes 

circuitry for detecting when no or any key is pressed 
down and thereupon generating a no or any key down 

signal, circuitry for detecting when more than one key is 
pressed down and thereupon generating a multiple key down 

signal, and an interrupt generator coupled to the 
aforementioned circuitry. The interrupt generator itself 

includes circuitry for detecting a change in no or any 
key down signal level, circuitry for detecting a change 

in multiple key down signal level, and circuitry for 
generating an interrupt signal when either the circuitry 

for detecting a change in no or any key down signal level 
or the circuitry for detecting a change in multiple key 

down signal level detects a change.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to our following patent 
applications: 
The present invention generally relates to computer 
keypads. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to keypad scanners.  A wide variety of devices may be used to interface 
with computer systems. One of the more popular of such 
devices is a keypad. Computer systems distinguish between 
keys on a keypad by assigning each key an individual 
value. These values are typically represented by a row 
signal and a column signal. When a key is pressed, the 
keypad presents the value of that key for input into the 
computer. In processing keypad input, computer systems 
typically first discern when a key has been pressed for 
input, and then they register the value of the key that 
has been pressed. Prior computer systems have used a 
keypad scanner to discern when a key has been pressed for 
input into the computer system. The keypad scanner 
periodically samples the key value presented by the 
keypad for input into the computer. A clock is used to 
determine the periodic rate at which the scanner samples 
the key values. After each sample, the scanner places 
the key value into a new value latch. The latched new 
value is then compared to an old value in a second latch. 
If there is a difference between the two latched values, 
then a status change signal is generated to indicate to 
the computer that a key has been pressed for input. Upon 
receiving a status change signal, the computer system 
registers the value of the key pressed and the scanner 
updates the old value latch with the value of the pressed 
key. One disadvantage of prior art keypad scanners is the 
large amount of power required to operate them. 
Components of a keypad scanner include a clock and two  
 
latches, which require a constant supply of power. 
Also, power must be supplied to circuitry which compares 
the old latch value with the new latch value. The 
circuitry must be supplied with power for each cycle of 
the clock regardless of whether a change in keypad status 
has occurred. Effectively, therefore, the clock, two 
latches, and comparing circuitry of the keypad scanner 
consume power even during periods of inactivity of the 
keypad. Lacking keypad detectors that do not require 
power except when a change in keypad status occurs is a 
shortcoming and deficiency of the prior art. Another disadvantage of prior art keypad scanners is 
their complexity. In order to operate, such keypad 
scanners must store an old key value into a first latch, 
read a new
