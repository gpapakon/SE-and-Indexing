<ABSTRACT>
A field effect-controllable semiconductor device consists of a semiconductor body (1) having (a) a first conductivity type interior zone adjoining a first surface (3) of the semiconductor body; (b) an opposite second conductivity type anode zone (4) between the interior zone (2) and the other surface (5) of the semiconductor body; (c) one or more second conductivity type first base zones (7) and one or more first conductivity type source zones (8) embedded in the first surface (3); (d) one or more source electrodes (9) contacting the base and source zones (7, 8); and (e) one or more gate electrodes (10) which are insulated from the semiconductor body (1) and the source electrode (9) by a gate oxide (11) and which (partially) cover the first base zone (7) portions exposed at the first surface (3). The novelty is that the source zones (8) are contained in inter-cell zones (12) which are enclosed by trenches (13), the trenches (13) being insulated from the inter-cell zones (12) by the gate oxide (11) and containing gate electrode plugs (14) connected to the gate electrode (10) at the first surface (3).
