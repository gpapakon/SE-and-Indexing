<ABSTRACT>
This refuse receptacle (pedal bin) includes a basket consisting of a support (1) and of a removable container (2) open at its top (2a), which is mounted so as to rock on a self-supporting chassis (6), including a fixed lid (3) intended to close the said opening (2a). When a pedal (4) is actuated with the foot, against a spring for returning towards the closure position, the basket (1-2) rocks on the chassis (6), distancing the opening (2a) from the lid (3). The two end-of-travel positions are such that the corresponding longitudinal directions (7) of the container (2) are both inclined with respect to the vertical and in different directions from each other, the vertical being defined as inclined with respect to the axis of the cylindrical part of the chassis via the base (30) of the latter placed on a horizontal floor.

Foot-operated refuse receptacle, including a
household refuse reception support (1) which is provided

for this purpose with a top aperture (2a) and is mounted
on a self-supporting framework (6) for tilting under the

action of a foot-operated pedal (4) in such a way that, in
a rest position or closed position, said aperture (2a) is

closed by a fixed cover (3) integral with said framework
(6) and that, in an open position or use position, said

aperture (2a) is cleared away from said cover and made
accessible, characterized in that said foot-operated

control pedal (4) is mounted at the lower part of said
framework (6) and associated with control and transmission

means (10 - 19) adapted to cause said support (1) to tilt
on said framework (6) between two positions, open and

closed respectively, around a tilting axis (5)
intersecting a longitudinal axis (7) of the support (1)

which substantially crosses the center of mass thereof
whereas the corresponding positions of said longitudinal

axis (7) are both inclined, in two mutually opposite
directions, with respect to a vertical direction defined

by a base (30) of said framework (6) resting on a
horizontal ground.
Refuse receptacle as in claim 1, characterized
in that said open and closed positions, when the support

(1) is tilted, are such that the corresponding positions
of the longitudinal axis (7) thereof are mutually

symmetrical with respect to said vertical direction.
Refuse receptacle as in any preceding claim,
characterized in that the tilting axis (5) of the support

is nearer to the bottom (1a) than to the top of said 
support (1).
Refuse receptacle as in any preceding claim,
characterized in that it includes a container (2),

removably disposed in said support (1).
Refuse receptacle as in any preceding claim,
characterized in that the support (1) and/or the container

(2) include(s) a bottom (1a; 2b) shaped such that the
cross-section thereof by any plane normal to the tilting

axis (5) is circular and centered around said axis (5),
with said bottom preferably having a spherical shape

centered at the intersection point of the tilting axis (5)
with the longitudinal axis (7) of the support (1).
Refuse receptacle as in any preceding claim,
characterized in that the framework (6) is made of an

integral plastic material piece, advantageously having a
flat, normally vertical part (6a) constituting a rear foot

of the refuse receptacle and concurrent with a flat part
(6b) inclined with respect to said vertical direction, as

well as a half cylindrical part (6c) for housing half of
the support (1) when the latter is in the closed position.
Refuse receptacle as in any preceding claim,
characterized in that the control and transmission means

include a lever having two arms (10) and being articulated
on the framework (6), and preferably disposed immediately

beneath the support (1), whereas one lever arm bears the
foot-operated pedal (4) and the other lever arm is

articulated (14) with one end of a connecting rod (12) the
other end of which is articulated on the support (1) at a

point (13) preferably located at the level of the tilting
axis (5) of the support (1). 
Refuse receptacle as in claim 6, characterized
in that the assembly formed by the pedal (4), the lever

(10), and the connecting rod (12) is made of one integral
plastic material piece, with at least the articulation

(14) linking the lever (10) and the connecting rod (12)
consisting of a thinning effected in said plastic material

piece.
Refuse receptacle as in any preceding claim,
characterized in that said control and transmission means

(10, 12, 19) are housed during their movements in a recess
(21) inside the framework (1), in particular inside the

part (6a) constituting a rear foot as in claim 6.
Refuse receptacle as in any preceding claim,
characterized in that the control means include spring

return means (19), preferably linking the connecting rod
(12) as in claim 8 or 9 with the framework (1) on the part

(6a) constituting the rear foot in the vicinity of the
rest base (30) thereof, and permanently urging the support

(1) towards the closed position thereof.
