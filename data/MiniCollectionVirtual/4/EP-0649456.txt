<DESCRIPTION>
 "Oil Additives and Compositions" This invention relates to oil compositions, primarily to fuel oil compositions, for example fuel oil compositions especially susceptible to wax formation at low temperatures, and to the use of additive compositions in such oil compositions to improve their low temperature properties.Heating oils and other distillate petroleum fuels, for example, diesel fuels, contain alkanes that at low temperature tend to precipitate as large crystals of wax in such a way as to form a gel structure which causes the fuel to lose its ability to flow. The lowest temperature at which the fuel will still flow is known as the pour point.As the temperature of the fuel falls and approaches the pour point, difficulties arise in transporting the fuel through lines and pumps. Further, the wax crystals tend to plug fuel lines, screens, and filters at temperatures above the pour point. These problems are well recognized in the art, and various additives have been proposed, many of which are in commercial use, for depressing the pour point of fuel oils. Similarly, other additives have been proposed and are in commercial use for reducing the size and changing the shape of the wax crystals that do form. Smaller size crystals are desirable since they are less likely to clog a filter; certain additives inhibit the wax from crystallizing as platelets and cause it to adopt an acicular habit, the resulting needles being more likely to pass through a filter than are platelets. The additives may also have the effect of retaining in suspension in the fuel the crystals that have formed, the resulting reduced settling also assisting in prevention of blockages. 

 Effective wax crystal modification (as measured by CFPP and other operability tests, as well as simulated and field performance) may be achieved by ethylene- vinyl acetate or propionate copolymer (EVAC or EVPC)- based flow improvers. CFPP, as used in this specification, is measured as described in "Journal of the Institute of Petroleum", 52 (1966), 173.In EP-A-45342 is described a cold flow additive, based on an EVAC modified by esterification with 2-ethylhexanoic, acrylic, and phthalic acids.In " issenschaft und Technik" 42(6), 238 (1989), M. Ratsch & M. Gebauer describe cold flow additives including an EVAC esterified with, inter alia, n- hexanoic acid.In U.S. Patent No. 3 961 916, middle distillate flow improvers are described which comprise a wax growth arrestor and a nucleating agent, the former being preferably a lower molecular weight ethylene-
