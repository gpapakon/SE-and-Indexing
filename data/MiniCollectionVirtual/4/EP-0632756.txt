<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive filament, including a thermoplastic elastomer having abrasive particles dispersed and adhered therein, exhibits improved life over previously known abrasive-filled polymeric filaments. Previously known abrasive-filled nylon filaments have limited stiffness and lose their stiffness as temperatures approach 70  DEG C. The abrasive filaments of the present invention are more efficient and more resistant to flex fatigue failure than abrasive-filled nylon filaments. Methods of making abrasive filaments of the invention, articles including the abrasive filaments, and methods of abrading surfaces using the abrasive articles of the invention are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to abrasive filaments comprising at least 
one layer component which includes an abrasive-filled thermoplastic elastomer. Abrasive-filled nylon filaments were developed in the late 1950's as a 
man made alternative to natural abrasive filaments. At about that time an 
extrusion process was developed for dispersing abrasive particles uniformly in a 
nylon matrix in the form of a filament (U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,522,342 and 
3,947,169). A review of nylon abrasive filaments is presented by Watts, J.H., 
"Abrasive Monofilaments-Critical Factors that Affect Brush Tool Performance", 
Society of Manufacturing Engineers Technical Paper, 1988, a written version of 
a presentation by the author at the WESTEC Conference, held March 21-24, 
1988. As explained by Watts, as filaments of this type wear, new abrasive 
particles are exposed. An abrasive filament brush tool made using a plurality 
of these filaments is thus regenerated during use. Some of the advantages of 
nylon abrasive filaments are their safety, cleanliness, cutting speed, low cost, 
superior radius and finish control, adaptability, and ease in design. A key property of nylon and other thermoplastic materials is its 
"memory". In a brush filament this is referred to in the art as "bend 
recovery", or the tendency for a deflected filament to return to its original 
deployment. The bend recovery for nylon is generally over 90%, i.e., the 
filament returns to about 90% of its original deployment after being deflected. Over time in operation, such as in a brush tool, most abrasive-filled 
polymeric filaments will take a set shape, and unless the filaments of the brush  
 
tool recover, the brush tool becomes soft and loses its effectiveness. Bend 
recovery is determined by filament diameter, relaxation time, strain, deflection 
time, and environmental conditions. Among synthetic filaments made to date, 
nylon offers the best bend recovery from strain held for an extended period of 
time. While adequate for many purposes, the inventors herein have found that 
the various abrasive-filled nylon filaments have property limitations which make 
their use less than optimal as abrasive filaments. Abrasive-filled nylon 
filaments have limited stiffness and may lose their stiffness as filament 
temperature approaches 70°C, and thus may not be suitable for removing heavy 
scale or burrs when elevated filament temperatures are developed. Temperature 
resistance is critical in maintaining filament stiffness. Elevated temperatures
