<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for operating a pipeline (12) for flowing media, preferably for water, deionised water or condensate, which media flow at least partially through an apparatus (14) arranged in the pipeline (12) and provided with a bypass line (16), a change in the distribution of the partial flows being effected by a change in the flow resistance of the bypass line (16) when a reduction in the volumetric flow of the flowing medium leads to increased flow resistance or stoppage of flow.

Method of operating an item of equipment provided
with a bypass line, for example a heat exchanger for

flowing media, preferably for water, deionized water or
condensate, which media flow through the bypass line at

least in partial flow, characterized in that, if the flow
resistance in the item of equipment increases when the

volumetric flow of the medium is reduced, the division of
the partial flows is changed by the flow resistance in

the bypass line being increased in such a way that the
item of equipment is sufficiently fed with flow medium.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the partial flow through the bypass line is

interrupted if the flow in the item of equipment stops as
a result of increased flow resistance.
Apparatus for carrying out the method according
to either of Claims 1 or 2, having a heat exchanger (14),

a bypass line (16) for the heat exchanger, and an
actuator (18) provided in the bypass line (16) and

intended for varying the flow resistance of the bypass
line (16), characterized in that the actuator (18) is

integrated in a measuring and control section and
operates in such a way that, if the flow resistance in

the heat exchanger (14) increases when the volumetric
flow of the medium is reduced, the actuator (18)

increases the flow resistance in the bypass line (16) in
such a way that it is equal to or exceeds the flow

resistance in the heat exchanger (14) so that the heat
exchanger is sufficiently fed with medium.
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the actuator (18) is a control valve. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the actuator (18) is a shut-off gate valve.
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the actuator (18) is a butterfly valve.
