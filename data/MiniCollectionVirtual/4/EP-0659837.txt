<ABSTRACT>
An improved process is provided for the preparation 
of siloxane-oxyalkylene block copolymer surfactant 

compositions which utilize a hydrosilylation reaction with a 
phenyl ether as the reaction solvent. The reaction solvent 

need not not be removed from the block copolymer, 
particularly when the block copolymer is used as a 

surfactant for polyurethane foam formulations. Ethylene 
glycol phenyl ether is the preferred reaction solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of siloxane-oxyalkylene
copolymers by the hydrosilylation
reaction of an organohydrogensiloxane and an olefinically
substituted polyoxyalkylene in a phenyl ether solvent. The
invention is also directed to siloxane-oxyalkylene
copolymers obtainable according to said process and the use thereof as surfactant in
urethane foam applications.The hydrosilylation reaction between the
organohydrogenpolysiloxane and an olefinically substituted
polyoxyalkylene reactant is typically performed in a low
molecular weight volatile hydrocarbon solvent such as
benzene, toluene, xylene or isopropyl alcohol to promote
reactant solubility, to aid reactant handling or to moderate
an exothermic reaction. Less typically, the hydrosilylation
reaction may be conducted without a solvent as in
U.S. 3,980,688 or conducted in an oxygen containing solvent
such as a high molecular weight alcohol.For example, U.S. 3,280,160 and 3,402,192 disclose
the preparation of copolymers in n-butylether and in a 50/50
mixture of isopropyl alcohol/toluene, respectively. In U.S.
4,122,029 the use of isopropyl alcohol is disclosed and in
U.S. 3,518,288 the patentee teaches the use of
n-propanol/toluene for the preparation of siloxane-oxyalkylene
copolymers. The solvents employed in U.S.
4,857,583 are saturated polyols containing two or more
hydroxyl groups. U.S. 4,857,583 states that if copolymers
containing monohydric higher alcohols are used in urethane
foam applications, these alcohols will enter the urethane
reaction and detrimentally act as reaction chain terminators
because they contain only one hydroxyl group. These reactions may also take place in a
monocarboxylate ester of an alkanediol solvent as in U.S.
5,153,293. These solvents are advantageous because
monocarboxylate ester solvents do not need to be stripped
and recovered from the product. In addition, the
monocarboxylate ester solvents are not hygroscopic, and
therefore problems associated with water contamination are
alleviated. Of the above mentioned solvents, isopropyl
alcohol (IPA) and toluene are the most common solvents used.Silicone polyethers containing polyether groups
greater than 10-12 ethylene oxide (EO) units tend to form a
hazy 2nd phase layer upon standing. This is believed to be
due to unreacted allyl polyether which is added in excess to
the reaction to facilitate complete consumption of the
silicone hydride. The excess polyether (of EO chain length
greater than EO 10-12) has a freeze point near or below room
temper
