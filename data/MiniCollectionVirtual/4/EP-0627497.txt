<ABSTRACT>
When a collimator (34) is employed between the target (30, 
31) and a substrate support (16) in a physical vapor 

deposition chamber (14), since the collimator (34) is 
grounded to the chamber walls, the chamber (14) becomes 

divided electrically, because the collimator (34) acts as a 
barrier to the passage of the plasma. Thus a two step 

plasma cleaning process must be performed to remove native 
oxide and sputtered deposits on parts of the chamber (14), 

particularly when parts of the chamber (14) are replaced or 
removed. The first plasma clean step is conventional and 

cleans the upper portion (14A) of the chamber (14) 
including the upper surface (38) of the collimator (34). A 

positive bias source (40) is then connected to the 
substrate support (16) and a second cleaning plasma 

generated between the collimator (34) and the support (16) 
which cleans the parts of the chamber (14) below the 

collimator (34), including the bottom surface (37) of the 
collimator (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cleaning shields and other 
parts of a physical vapor deposition chamber to remove films 
deposited thereon. More particularly this invention relates to 
cleaning a physical vapor deposition chamber containing a 
collimator in a two step process. A Physical vapor deposition apparatus comprises a vacuum 
chamber having a target of a preselected material mounted 
thereon which is connected to a DC power supply; and a 
substrate which is mounted on a substrate support opposed to 
the target, which is connected to an RF power supply. During 
processing, the target material is bombarded with an inert gas, 
such as argon. Material from the target is dislodged or 
sputtered off and deposits onto the substrate, which can be for 
example a silicon wafer, a magnetic disk or a flat panel 
display. However, the sputtered material does not deposit in a 
line-of-sight direction only, and the sputtered material 
deposits on other parts of the chamber, such as the shield or 
clamping ring for the substrate. In order to increase the directionality of the sputtered 
material onto the substrate, the use of a collimator has been 
suggested. However, even when a collimator is used, the sputtered 
material deposits not only on the substrate, but also on 
surrounding parts of the chamber, such as clamping rings that 
hold the substrate onto the support during processing. Shields  
 
surrounding the substrate have been used to try to prevent 
sputtered material from depositing on the walls and other parts 
of the chamber. However, the shields become coated with the 
sputtered material and, due to build up of material that may 
have a coefficient of expansion different from that of the 
shield material itself, eventually results in flaking of the 
deposited material; this has the result that the deposited 
material forms particles in the chamber. Since deposition of 
these particles on the substrate may damage the small feature 
sized devices being made on the substrate, which would lower 
the yield of good devices, the formation of particles in the 
chamber must be avoided. Further, if there is any native oxide 
on the shield/clamping ring surfaces, the sputtered material 
does not adhere well and flaking results after fewer sputtering 
cycles than when the native oxide has been removed. Once 
flaking and particle generation has begun, the chamber must be 
disassembled and the various parts cleaned or replaced. Thus it is also known to etch clean the shield and 
clamping ring periodically to remove
