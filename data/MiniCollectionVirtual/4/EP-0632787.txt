<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to document feeders; and,
more particularly, the invention relates to a document
feeder which has the capability of both adapting to nonuniformities
of document feeder parts and of altering the
flow path of a document propagated through a document
handling apparatus.Document feeding mechanisms in document handling
apparatus are generally characterized by at least one,
preferably more, drive rollers which pinch a document
between the drive roller(s) and so-called idle rollers. As
the rollers rotate, a document pinched between them will be
propagated. Preferably a plurality of idle rollers
cooperating with at least one drive roller are disposed
transversely to the direction of document propagation. Due
to asymmetries between respectively cooperating drive and
idle rollers, caused either initially by manufacturing
tolerances, or subsequently by uneven wear, irregular or
asymmetric feeding of the documents can result with
consequent jams which lead to undesirable down-time of the
document handling apparatus.Accordingly, it is a primary object of this
invention to minimize the consequences of asymmetries
between cooperating idle, and drive rollers.The problems of asymmetry between cooperating
idle, and drive rollers become more acute when the document
feeding apparatus is also asked to perform a second
function, in addition to document feeding. When a document
feeding mechanism is also used to alter, or divert, the
flow path of a document to a different destination within
the document handling apparatus, the repetitive motion
required to repeatedly alter the direction of document
motion will cause a build-up of wear likely to result in
undesirable asymmetry.Accordingly, it is another object of this 
invention to provide a document feeding and diverting
device which adapts itself automatically to uneven wear
between respective idle, and drive, roller assemblies.A common form of diverting apparatus generally
adds to a first set of idle rollers always in contact with
drive roller(s) a second set of idle rollers spaced from
the first set along the direction of document propagation.
When a divert path for the document is desirable, the
second set of idle rollers is also brought into temporary
engagement with the periphery of the drive roller(s) by
pivoting the second set about an axis that is the axis of
rotation of the first set of idle rollers. Because such
temporary engagements of the second set of idle rollers
with the drive roller(s) occurs suddenly and with some
rapidity, it is

<CLAIMS>
A document feeding apparatus including

first housing means (16) for supporting a first set of
transversely spaced idle rollers (24), said idle rollers being

spaced along an axis of rotation (A-A) of the idle
rollers and transversely to the document feed direction, the

apparatus further comprising:
first means (10) allowing
the first housing means (16) and the first set of idle rollers (24)

supported thereby to pivot about an axis (B-B) that is
perpendicular to the axis of rotation (A-A) of said first set of

idle rollers (24), and
drive roller means (36) cooperating with said first set
of idle rollers (24) whereby each one of said first set of idle

rollers continues to cooperate with the drive
roller means (36) despite unevenness in a contact face between an

idle roller and the drive roller means, characterized in that said first means (10) include a pivot bearing (10), and
resilient compliance means (24a) are disposed in contact with said first set of transversely spaced idle rollers (24) so as to adapt to
said unevenness in the contact face.
Apparatus according to claim 1, further including
a second set of idle rollers (28) supported by said first housing

means (16) and

pivot means (16) for allowing said second set of idle
rollers (28) to pivot between first and second positions around

the axis of rotation (A-A) of said first set of idle rollers (24).
Apparatus according to claim 2, further including:

second housing means (18) for supporting a third set of
transversely spaced idle rollers (26); and
second means, including a pivot bearing, allowing
the second housing means (18) and the third set of idle rollers (26)

supported thereby to pivot about an axis (B-B) that is
perpendicular to the axis of rotation (A-A) of said second set of

the idle rollers (28), and 
drive roller means (36) cooperating with said third set of idle
rollers (26) whereby each one of said third set of

idle rollers (26) continues to cooperate with the
drive roller means (36) despite unevenness in the contact face.
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said pivot
means (16) further include solenoid means (32) which, when actuated,

causes said second set of idle rollers (28) to pivot between
first and second positions.
Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein said first
and second housing means (16, 18) are spaced transversely along the

axis of rotation (A-A) of the idle rollers.
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said
compliance means (24a) comprise resilient O-rings mounted on the

periphery of said first set of transversely spaced idle
rollers (24).
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein said
compliance means (24a) comprise resilient 0-rings mounted on the

periphery of said second set of transversely spaced idle
rollers (28).
Apparatus according to claim 7 wherein the O-rings
mounted on the periphery of said first set of transversely

spaced idle rollers (24) have a hardness differing from the
hardness of the resilient 0-rings mounted on the periphery

of said second set of transversely spaced idle rollers (28).
Apparatus according to claim 8 wherein the
hardness of the O-rings mounted on the periphery of said

first set of transversely spaced idle rollers (24) is greater
than the hardness of the O-rings mounted on the periphery of

said second set of transversely spaced idle rollers (28).
