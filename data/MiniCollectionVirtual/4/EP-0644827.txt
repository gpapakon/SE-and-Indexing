<ABSTRACT>
The invention comprises a modular pattern roll for embossing a cellulosic fibrous structure. The pattern roll is made by assembling separate components, rather than being one piece and chemically etched according to the prior art. The pattern roll comprises a cylindrically perforate outer shell (40) having radially extending protuberances (30) inserted through the holes in the cylindrical shell (4). The protuberances (30) are provided with an interference fit and/or, if desired, a shoulder (44) at the proximal end to prevent the protuberances (30) from being extruded and expelled through the hole (42) and creating a missile hazard during operation. The center of the hollow cylindrically perforate shell is filled with a base roll (48) and a radially expanding internal locking assembly (64), to prevent the protuberances (30) from moving radially inwardly under the compressive forces which occur during operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates a process for converting a cellulosic 
structure such as a paper tissue, this process comprising the use of 
pattern rolls, which are being operated in close tolerance relation. 
The present invention also relates to cellulosic fibrous structures 
being converted in such a process. Rolls used to convert, and particularly to emboss, cellulosic 
fibrous structures are well known in the papermaking art. Converting 
refers to any post drying operation which permanently affects any 
property of a cellulosic fibrous structure. Converting rolls typically 
have a pattern of radially extending protuberances which imparts the 
emboss pattern to the cellulosic fibrous structure. Each roll may be 
integral, or may be constructed from a plurality of components assembled 
in a particular configuration. A roll made from an integral assembly typically has the periphery of 
the roll, between the protuberances, chemically etched away, to leave 
only the radially extending protuberances unaffected by the etching 
process. The protuberances may then be machined to the final dimensions 
with a great deal of accuracy. However, such an etching process leaves the periphery of the roll 
between the proximal ends of the protuberances out of tolerance with 
respect to straightness, concentricity, and diameter. Because this 
periphery of the roll is not a close tolerance surface and may be out of 
tolerance with respect to the foregoing parameters, the roll may be 
unsuitable for use in manufacturing which requires a great deal of 
accuracy at the roll periphery. Because the periphery of the roll is not a close tolerance surface, 
the periphery of the roll may be unsuitable for and hence is not used in  
 
the manufacturing process. This unsuitability represents a great waste, 
because, frequently, the periphery of the roll between the protuberances 
represents the majority of the surface area of the roll and the 
protuberances represent only a small percentage of the total surface area 
of the roll. Various attempts in the art to provide rolls constructed as an 
assembly have not been successful in overcoming this waste. For example, 
certain attempts in the art disclose magnetically attached flexible 
plates to the surface of an embossing roll. The plates may be removed 
and replaced as desired. Other attempts have utilized interference fits 
to assemble the components of the roll. Examples of such attempts in the 
art include U.S. Patents 4,116,594 issued September 26, 1978 to Leanna et 
al. and

<CLAIMS>
A process for converting a cellulosic fibrous structure, said process 
comprising the steps of: 


providing a first and a second generally cylindrically shaped pattern roll 
(28), said rolls (28) having radially oriented protuberances (30) projecting 

with their distal end (45f) outwardly through holes (42) of the perforate 
shells (40) of said rolls, whereby the rolls and the protuberances are 

positioned in a fixed relationship by shoulders (44) at the proximal end of 
the protuberances being pressed against the inside surface of the 

perforated shell (40); providing a cellulosic fibrous structure to be 
converted; disposing said cellulosic fibrous structure in contacting 

relationship with said periphery of said pattern roll and in contacting 
relationship with said protuberances extending from said pattern roll; and 

compressing said cellulosic fibrous structure and said pattern roll together 
with compressive forces sufficient to densify said cellulosic fibrous 

structure at sites in contacting relationship with said protuberances;
 
CHARACTERIZED by 
disposing said rolls in an axially parallel relationship to form a nip 
therebetween, and converting said cellulosic fibrous structure in said nip 

thereby formed. 
Process according to claims 1, with said 
pattern rolls CHARACTERIZED by 


said radial anvil comprising a hardenable resin, and 
preferably further comprising a further roll disposed 

inside said 

cylindrically perforate shell and forming an annular 
space between said further roll and said 

cylindrically perforate shell, whereby said resin is 
disposed in said annular space and is intermediate 

said further roll and said cylindrically perforate 
shell. 
A process according to Claims 1 and 2 further comprising 
the step of adhesively joining said laminae. 
A process according to Claims 1 to 3, further 
comprising the step of heating at least one said pattern 

roll. 
A cellulosic fibrous structure produced according to any of 
the preceeding claims.
