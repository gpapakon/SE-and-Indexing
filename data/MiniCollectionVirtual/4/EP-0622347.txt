<ABSTRACT>
Ethylene is trimerized to form 1-hexene by using a catalyst 
comprising an 

aluminoxane and polydentate phosphine, arsine, and/or stibine 
coordination complex of 

a chromium salt. 
These catalysts form a second aspect of the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the oligomerization of ethylene and more
specifically to the preparation of 1-hexene by the trimerization of ethylene using a
catalyst which includes an aluminoxane and a chromium complex containing a coordinating
polydentate phosphine, stibine or arsine ligand, such as a tridentate phosphine
complex of a chromium salt.Published European patent application, publication number 0,537,609, discloses
an ethylene oligomerization/ trimerization process which uses a catalyst
comprising a chromium complex which contains a coordinating polydentate ligand and
an aluminoxane to produce high quality Î±-olefins which are enriched in 1-hexene.Suitable ligands include cyclic polyamines, and polypyrazolyl borates.US-P-4,777,315 describes a process for the trimerization of an olefin selected from the
group consisting of ethylene, propylene, 1-butene and mixtures thereof, comprising passing
the olefin and carbon dioxide in contact with a catalyst comprising the reaction product of
(i) a chromium compound and (ii) a hydrocarbyl aluminium hydrolyzed with about 0.7 to
about 1.1 moles of water per mole of aluminium compound.EP-A-0 237 079 relates to a process for trimerization of an olefin comprising passing the
olefin in contact with a catalyst comprising the reaction product of (i) a chromium
compound, (ii) a hydrocarbyl aluminium hydrolyzed with 0.8 to 1.1 moles of water per
mole of aluminium compound and (iii) a donor ligand selected from hydrocarbyl isonitriles,
amines and ethers.Briggs et al. describe in J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 11 (1989), 674-675 a homogeneous
three component catalyst of chromium, hydrolysed alkylaluminium and dimethoxyethane for
use in the trimerization of ethylene to hexene-1 in 74 % selectivity at a rate of 1.2 mol
(mol Cr)-1s-1.Manyik et al. illustrate in J. Catal. 47(2) (1977), 197-209 a soluble chromium based catalyst
for ethylene trimerization and polymerization, which catalyst is formed by the interaction of
chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate with partially hydrolyzed triisobutylaluminium.I have now found that certain polydentate ligand complexes of chromium salts
in combination with aluminoxanes can catalyze ethylene oligomerization, and especially
ethylene trimerization to form 1-hexene, with a very high degree of selectivity,
e.g. about 95%.In accordance with this invention there is provided a process for the
trimerization of ethylene which process comprises reacting ethylene using a catalyst
which is as defined
in claim 1.Also provided is an ethylene
