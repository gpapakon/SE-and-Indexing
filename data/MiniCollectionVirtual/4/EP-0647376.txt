<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clock phase detector for synchronous data transmission in the receiver of a data transmission system in which, in order to obtain a clock phase criterion from the received signal, two neighbouring main scanning values per symbol duration T and another intermediate scanning value midway between the two are formed. The pattern-dependent jitter is to be eliminated from such a clock phase detector. This is achieved by the invention by a modification to the Gardner process which eliminates the effects of neighbouring symbol interference on the clock phase criterion and thus reduces natural jitter.

Clock phase detector for synchronous data transmission 
in the receiver of an RF information transmission 

system, in which two adjacent main samples and a further 
intermediate sample located centrally between these two 

are formed from the received signal for obtaining a clock 
phase criterion for each symbol, characterised in that 

the systematic phase jitter produced as a consequence of 
the dependence of the intermediate sample on the adjacent 

main samples and the remaining transmitted symbols is 
eliminated by subtracting the influences of the contributory 

transmitted symbols from this intermediate sample 
with the aid of a transversal filter (15 to 20; 21 to 28; 

29 to 35) which is arranged in the signal path of the 
main samples and the filter output of which is connected 

to a subtraction element (14), the second input of which 
is supplied with the intermediate sample, and in that the 

output of this subtraction element (14) and the output of 
a further subtraction element (12) combining the two main 

samples adjacent to the intermediate sample are connected 
to a multiplier element (13) from which the clock phase 

criterion can be taken. 
Clock phase detector according to Claim 1, 
characterised by a modified clock phase criterion, using 

signal samples with decision feedback, which samples are 
extracted after a discriminator (37) and are used instead 

of the main samples of the received signal. 
Clock phase detector according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that for QAM systems the signal paths 

for the real part and for the imaginary part of the 
signal when it is used are correspondingly constructed  

 
and are logically combined with one another. 
Clock phase detector according to one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterised by a digital clock phase criterion 

being stored in the form of a table in an EPROM.
