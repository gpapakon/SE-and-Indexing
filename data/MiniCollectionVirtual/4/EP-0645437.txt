<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to iron oxide pigments which are characterised in that the red content in the building material test is more than 33 CIELAB units. The precipitated pigments are subjected with stirring to a ripening process, preferably at pH values from 3 to 5.5 and temperatures from 70 to 95 DEG C. The pigments are used in the form of pastes, slurries or granules.

<CLAIMS>
Iron oxide pigments, characterised in that the red 
component a* in the building material test is more 

than 33 CIELAB units. 
Iron oxide pigment according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the red component a* in the building material 

test is more than 34 CIELAB units. 
Process for the production of pure-coloured iron oxide 
pigments according to one of Claims 1 or 2 by the 

precipitation process, characterised in that a process 
of ripening by agitation without further gassing is 

coupled to the pigment formation, wherein before 
ripening the PH is adjusted to 3.0 to 5.5, preferably 

4.0 to 4.5, and the temperature of the suspension 
during ripening is about 70 to 95°C, preferably about 

80 to 90°C. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterised in that 
the pigment suspension is agitated for 0.5 to 30 

hours, preferably 1 to 10 hours. 
Process according to Claim 3 or 4, characterised in 
that the iron oxide pastes, on feeding to the unit for 

drying them, have a solids content of at least 
60 wt.%. 
Use of the iron oxide pigments according to Claims 1 
or 2 or produced by the process according to one or 

more of Claims 3 to 5, characterised in that the 
pigment is used in the form of pastes or slurries.  

 
Use of the iron oxide pigments according to Claims 1 
or 2 or produced by the process according to one or 

more of Claims 3 to 5, characterised in that the 
pigment is used in the form of granular material.
