<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a base film
for a photographic film. More specifically, it relates
to a base film for a photographic film, which is
excellent in transparency and hue and free from, or
almost free from, whitening in a fold and which is
formed of a polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate
copolymer as a raw material.A biaxially oriented polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate
film has excellent mechanical,
thermal and electrical properties, and has been and is
studied for use in a variety of fields. Further, it is
practically used in the fields of a magnetic recording
medium and electric insulation.For example, a film is used in the field of a
photosensitive material, and this field is largely
classified into a field where it is used in the form of
a sheet such as an X-ray film, a printing film or a cut
film and a field where it is used as a roll film. The
typical example of the roll film is a color or black
and white negative film which is 35 mm wide or less and
used in a film cartridge to be encased in a general
camera for taking photos.A biaxially oriented polyester film formed of
a polyethylene terephthalate is mainly used as a base
film for a film in the form of a sheet, and a film of a
cellulose polymer typified by triacetyl cellulose (to
be sometimes abbreviated as "TAC" hereinafter) is
mainly used as a base for a roll film.A TAC film has characteristic features in
that it is free of optical anisotropy, that it is with
high transparency and that it is excellent in the
property of freedom from curling after treated for
development. It is generally said that the excellent
freedom of a TAC film from curling is the feature which 
does not belong to a film of any other material.
Since, however, an organic solvent is used in the step
of producing a TAC film, it is required to recover the
solvent completely for the prevention of environmental
pollution. In particular, environmental destruction is
one of the issues which attract attention, and there is
an intense tendency to avoid the use of an organic
solvent which may cause environmental destruction.On the other hand, a polyethylene
terephthalate film is that which can be formed by a
melt extrusion method using no organic solvent, and it
is used as a base film for a photosensitive material in
part of the field of photosensitive materials.However, a polyethylene terephthalate film
involves problems in that it undergoes curling (curling
tendency) and that it is difficult to remove the
curling.Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No.
