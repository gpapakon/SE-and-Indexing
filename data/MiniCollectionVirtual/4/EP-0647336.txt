<ABSTRACT>
Reducing device for reducing the pressure of an infed fluid. The reducing device comprises a housing (1) with a pressure-regulating part (2) fixed thereto. According to the invention, a shutt-off part (4) is fitted on the same side. This makes the reducing device more readily accessible for maintenance work. A monitor part can also be fitted between the regulating part and the shutt-off part. This provides a particularly compact unit, which can even be installed underground.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Reducing device.The present invention relates to a reducing device according to the preamble of Claim 1.Such a device is disclosed by German "Auslegeschrift" l,2l4,065. The latter discloses a reducing valve with safety device. Both the pressure-regulating part and the shut-off part are fitted at one side of the housing. The regulating part is fitted further away from the hous¬ ing than the shut-off part. Such reducing devices are used in, for example, the "medium pressure" part of distribution networks for natural gas. They generally comprise, a pressure-regulating part, a monitor part and a shut-off part. In this case the pressure-regulating part serves primarily to carry out the pressure-reducing function. If said pressure- regulating part fails, its function is taken over by the monitor part, which is set at a slightly higher pressure. If the monitor part fails, the shut-off part, which is set at an even higher pressure, goes into operation. In this case, however, the flow of gas is completely' blocked. It was usual to place three valves with the corresponding functions in series one after the other. However, this took up a considerable amount of space, which constitutes a problem in particular in towns, where such reducing devices are commonly used. It is important for preventive main¬ tenance that such reducing devices should be readily accessible so that the various "soft" parts can be replaced in a simple way. This means that cabinets taking up a relatively large amount of space are always neces¬ sary, and in towns safety measures have to be taken to ensure that access by unauthorised people is prevented. In order to deal with these pro¬ blems, a reducing device in which regulating part and shut-off part are integral was proposed in the prior art. In this case the regulating part was fitted at one side of the housing, and the shut-off part at the other. Although in this way the overall length of the reducing device could be considerably reduced because only a monitor part now needed to be fitted alongside, the problems concerning accessibility remained. For, if one of the two parts is fitted facing upwards, sufficient space has to be available below it for the relevant preventive and other maintenance work on the other part at the bottom. The object of the present invention is to avoid these disadvantages. This object is achieved in the case of a reducing device of the type described above by the characterising measures of Claim 1. Surprisingly, it has been found that it is possible to place the

 CLAIMS
1. Reducing device for reducing the pressure of an infed fluid, comprising a housing (1) having fixed at one side thereof a pressure- regulating part (2) and a shut-off part (4) for operating by means of a spindle a .spring-loaded valve (9) for blocking the fluid flow through the housing (1) , characterised in that the regulating part (2) is fitted adjoining the housing (1) and comprises a sleeve (12) , while the shut-off part (4) is fitted adjoining the side of the regulating part (2) facing away from the housing (1) , and the spindle for operating the spring- loaded valve (9) comprises a valve spindle (13. 34, 65) connected to said valve (9) and guided axially through the sleeve (12) .
2. Reducing device according to Claim 1, in which a monitor part (3) is provided between the regulating part (2) and the shut-off part (4), which monitor part (3) comprises a regulating device with a higher regulating pressure than regulating part (2), while the monitor (3) is provided with a sleeve (23) for accommodation therein of the valve spindle (34, 65).
3. Reducing device according to one of the preceding claims, in which the regulating part comprises a ring diaphragm (25) connected to sleeve (12) , so as to form a seal with a seat face (24) .
4. Reducing device according to Claim 2 or 3. in which the sleeve of the monitor part is displaceable depending on the pressure, which sleeve (23) is provided near one end with a sealing face which can inter¬ act with a further sealing face in order to control the fluid supply to the regulating part (2) .
5- Reducing device according to Claim 4, in which said further sealing face comprises a-part (21) of
*
 the sleeve (12) .
6. Reducing device according to one of the preceding claims, in which the shut-off part (4) comprises a diaphragm (46) and a controlled release device for the valve spindle (13-. 34, 65).
7. Reducing device according to Claim 6, in which the release device comprises a pressure sleeve (66) provided with a constriction, and connected to the valve spindle, and accommodated in a rotary sleeve (59) provided with recesses (59) and a number of locking elements provided between the rotary sleeve (59) and the pressure sleeve (66).
8. Reducing device according to Claim 7, in which the locking elements comprise a sleeve (60) provided with grooves (62) and having a thickened edge (6l) . 


9. Reducing device according to one of the preceding claims, in which the housing (1) is provided with filter means (77, 78) at the side away from the regulating part (2) .
