<ABSTRACT>
In the case of the natural wood panel according to the invention, the fibres (10) are inclined at an angle ( alpha ) of between 0@ and 90@, in particular between 20@ and 70@, to the plane (2) of the panel. A natural laminated wood panel has at least one layer of such natural wood panels (2) which are joined together, it being possible for the fibres (10) of the natural wood panels (2) to point in the same direction or in different directions. At least one further layer, which is joined to the layer of natural wood panels (2), can be provided, it being possible for this layer likewise to be a natural laminated wood panel or a layer of wood, wood pulp, sound-absorbing, heat-insulating, radiation-repelling or heat-conducting material.

fibres (10) of the natural wood panels (2) are aligned in different directions. 
A laminated natural wood panel according to any of claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that at least one further layer is provided and is bonded to the natural 

wood panel layer (2). 
A laminated natural wood panel according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
at least one further layer is a laminated natural wood panel according to any of claims 

3 to 5. 
A laminated natural wood panel according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
fibres (10) of the individual layers of the laminated natural wood panel are aligned in 

different directions.
