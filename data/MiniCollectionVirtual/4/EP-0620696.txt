<ABSTRACT>
Device for converting electrical oscillations into acoustic waves and/or for converting acoustic waves into electrical oscillations, having at least one electroacoustic transducer and a housing having at least two housing shells in the form of moulded plastic parts. A group of function components are functionally related. The housing shells are assembled to form a closed housing with a sound window allocated to the electroacoustic transducer, into which housing electric lines ending in contacting elements are introduced. The piezoelectric element is combined with a carrier foil which, at the same time, is constructed as a sound diaphragm or has such a diaphragm. The carrier foil exhibits the conductors connected to the piezoelectric element in the form of printed circuit tracks, the ends of which which are remote from the piezoelectric element are provided with contact constructions. All other function components and the contacting elements are arranged at the or in the housing shells. After the unit of piezoelectric element and carrier foil has been inserted into one of the housing shells, the function components are brought into functional relationship by combining the housing shells to form the housing.
