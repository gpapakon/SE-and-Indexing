<ABSTRACT>
Vehicle occupant restraint air bag module including 
a tubular inflator with a cylindrical diffuser member 

projecting perpendicularly from one side, a module housing 
(14), a retaining ring and a retaining bracket. An air bag 

inflating aperture is sandwiched between the retaining ring 
from the inside and the module housing (14) from the 

outside which are complementarily slotted (32) so as to 
accommodate one side of the inflator with its diffuser 

member sealingly engaging an opening (38) in the module 
housing (14). The retaining bracket is slotted so as to 

engage the opposite side of the inflator. Studs pass 
through aligned holes in the retaining ring, air bag, 

module housing (14) and retaining bracket to clamp them 
together around the inflator. Tabs (48, 50, 52, 54) extend 

from the module housing (14) through the air bag into holes 
in the retaining ring. Further tabs extend from the 

retaining ring through the air bag into holes (56, 58, 60, 
62) in the module housing (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air bag module for use on the
driver side of automotive and other vehicles wherein an
inflatable air bag or cushion is inflated in the event of a
collision to protect the driver from injury that could
result from being forcibly thrown against the steering
wheel, dashboard, etc. The air bag module uses a tubular
inflator assembly.Inflator assemblies that currently are in use in driver
side air bag modules, typically are toroidal types having
flat, disk-like shapes with the dimensions of the inflator
assembly typically being about 51 mm (2 inches) thick and
102 mm (4 inches) in diameter, much of the inflatable
cushion stored in the air bag module is folded in front of
the inflator assembly as opposed to the sides thereof.
While an inflator assembly having a tubular shape would
allow much of the cushion to be folded on the sides thereof
in an air bag module, a tubular inflator assembly will not
fit in driver side air bag modules as they are currently
designed.Inflator assemblies of the toroidal type produce a cushion
inflating gas source from a combustible gas generating
material which, upon ignition, generates a quantity of gas
sufficient to inflate the cushion. One form of tubular
inflator assembly similarly is operative to generate gas
for inflating cushions from a combustible gas generating
material. In another form of tubular inflator assembly,
however, the cushion inflating gas results from a
combination of stored compressed gas and a gas generating
material. The latter form of tubular inflator assembly is
commonly referred to as an augmented gas or hybrid
inflator. Hybrid inflators affect the performance of air 
bag modules in several ways including variation in the
amount of stored gas, the transmission of heat to the
stored gas and the rate at which the inflating gas is
dispensed into the inflatable cushion.One example of an air bag module which includes a tubular
inflator is described in US Patent No. 5186492 (on which
the pre-characterising part of claim 1 is based). The
module includes a housing with slotted or curved straps
against which a cylindrical inflator is held by a resilient
curved retaining bracket which engages a rear side of the
inflator. A rectangular mouth of an associated air bag is
connected by fasteners to peripheral wall portions of the
housing. Connection of the air bag and the inflator to the
housing accordingly require two separate fastening means
and manufacturing steps and the fasteners securing the air
bag increase the module's overall
