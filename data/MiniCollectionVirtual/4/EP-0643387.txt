<ABSTRACT>
A high-density recording medium has data tracks and guide 
tracks formed on both sides of each of the data tracks. 

Intervals between the guide tracks are set in such a manner that 

the outer edges of two adjacent guide tracks correspond in 
position to two tracking laser beam spots on the recording 

medium. To allow use of either of the high-density recording 
medium, and a conventional recording medium on which intervals 

between guide tracks are set in such a manner that the inner 
edges of two adjacent guide tracks correspond in position to 

two tracking laser beam spots, control is performed such that 
polarity of a tracking control servo is selectively inverted 

depending upon which of the high-density and conventional 
recording medium is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical recording
medium such as an optical card and an optical information
recording/reproducing system for use with the optical recording
medium. More particularly, the present invention relates to an
optical recording medium on which high-density recording is
advantageously achieved and also to a compatible, optical
information recording/reproducing system which is applicable
to both such a high-density optical recording medium and a
conventional (less-density) optical recording medium.Optical information recording/reproducing systems using an
optical recording medium such as an optical card are popularly
known today, and, in order for each of the
recording/reproducing system to perform information recording
on the optical recording medium, a plurality of optically
detectable guide tracks are repetitively formed on the
recording medium at predetermined intervals with a data track
formed between every two adjacent guide tracks. Thus, the
recording/reproducing system writes or reads information while
accurately positioning a reading or writing optical beam at a
desired data track on the basis of optical detection of the 
respective locations of the guide tracks (this technique is
called "tracking"). Typical prior examples of the information
recording and tracking techniques for such optical information
recording/reproducing systems are disclosed in, for example,
Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. SHO 60-229244, HEI
4-330647, HEI 4-341935 and HEI 5-101407 and Japanese Patent
Publication No. HEI 4-38067.Fig. 4 shows an optical recording medium (optical card 1)
and a read/write optical system 2 employed in a typical example
of a conventionally known optical information
recording/reproducing system. The prior art pertinent to the
present invention will be described hereinafter with reference
to this figure. The optical recording medium is an optical card
1 that is of course portable and removably attachable to the
read/write optical system 2. The read/write optical system 2
is accommodated within a casing (not shown) of the
recording/reproducing device. Upon insertion of the optical
card 1 into a predetermined insertion slot (not shown) formed
in the casing, the card 1 is automatically transferred in the
X direction by means of a card transfer mechanism (not shown)
until the card 1 reaches a predetermined position for
read/write operation by the optical system 2.The optical card 1 has a substrate formed of light-weight
hard material such as plastics and a
