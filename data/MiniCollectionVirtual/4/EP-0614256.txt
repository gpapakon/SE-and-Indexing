<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed tunable (wavelength and/or focal length) laser typically is 
a surface emitting laser that comprises a multilayer structure that comprises the 

lower Bragg reflector (11) and the active region (13). A layer of electro-optic 
material (199) (typically liquid crystal material) is in contact with the top 

surface of the multilayer structure, and means (193, 195) are provided for 

applying a voltage across the layer of electro-optic material. In one exemplary 
embodiment, the layer (199) is inside the laser cavity, making the laser wavelength 

tunable. In another exemplary embodiment the laser is a Z-laser that focuses the 
output radiation, with the multilayer structure comprising also the upper Bragg 

reflector. In this embodiment the layer of electro-optic material 
is outside the laser cavity, and the laser has tunable focal length. A still further 

embodiment is both wavelength- and focal length-tunable. Lasers according to the 
invention can be advantageously used in a variety of applications, e.g., in a 

wavelength division multiplexed and/or optically amplified optical fiber 
communication system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to articles (e.g., a wavelength division 
multiplexed (WDM) optical communication systems) that comprise a tunable 
semiconductor laser. Wavelength tunable semiconductor lasers are key components in many 
technological systems, exemplarily WDM optical fiber communication systems, and 
such lasers are known. For instance, P. R. Berger et al., AppliedPhysicsLetters, Vol. 
59, p. 117 (1991) discloses a surface emitting laser (SEL) that utilizes the Peltier 
effect of the substrate to achieve thermally induced tuning. However, this effect 
allows only a relatively small tuning range (typically about 1 nm). A semiconductor 
laser having much larger (e.g., > 10 nm) tuning range would be of significant 
technological interest. Electro-optic tuning of lasers by means that comprise liquid crystal 
material is known. However, the prior art devices typically involve an external 
cavity, with a separate liquid crystal-containing element in the external cavity. 
See, for instance, J. R. Andrews, IEEEPhotonicsTechnologyLetters, Vol. 2(5), p. 
334; H. Tsuda et al., IEEEPhotonicsTechnologyLetters, Vol. 3(6), p. 504; H. 
Tsuda et al., AppliedPhysicsLetters, Vol. 61(17), p. 2006; and Qi Zhang et al., 
OpticsLetters, Vol. 17(1), p. 43. Such light sources typically comprise a 
multiplicity of components in addition to the laser diode and thus typically would be 
inconvenient to use. This application inter alia discloses a simple, compact, 
wavelength-tunable semiconductor laser having a relatively large tuning range. The invention is as defined by the claims. In a broad aspect the 
invention is embodied in an article (e.g., an optical communications system) that 
comprises tunable (wavelength and/or focal distance) laser means, 
comprising a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). Typically, the laser means comprise a first body that has a major surface 
and comprises a semiconductor layer structure that includes multilayer 
semiconductor reflection means and an active region that is located between the 
reflection means and the major surface. The reflection means and the active region 
are essentially parallel with the surface. The laser means further comprise first 
contact means that facilitate flowing an electric current through the semiconductor 
layer structure such that the laser means emits output radiation. Still furthermore,  
 
the laser means comprise a quantity of electro-optic material (liquid 
crystal material), and also comprise second contact means that facilitate applying
