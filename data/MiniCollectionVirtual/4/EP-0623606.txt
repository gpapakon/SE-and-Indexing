<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a series of novel amino acid
analogs which exhibit selective inhibition of interleukin-1β-converting
enzyme, to compositions containing the novel
amino acid analogs and methods for therapeutic utility. More
particularly, the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme inhibitors
described in this invention comprise novel amino acid methyl
ketones which possess particular utility in the treatment of
inflammatory, immune-based diseases and cancer.Interleukin-1β protease (also known as interleukin-1β-converting
enzyme or ICE) is the enzyme responsible for
processing of the biologically inactive 31 kD precursor IL-1β
to the biologically active 17 kD form (Kostura, M.J.; Tocci,
M.J.; Limjuco, G.; Chin, J.; Cameron, P.; Hillman, A.G.; Chartrain,
N.A.; Schmidt, J.A. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 1989, 86, 5227-5231
and Black, R.A.; Kronheim, S.R.; Sleath, P.R. FEBS LET., 1989,
247, 386-391). In addition to acting as one of the body's early
responses to injury and infection, IL-1β has also been
proposed to act as a mediator of a wide variety of diseases,
including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory
bowel disease, sepsis, and acute and chronic myelogenous
leukemia (Dinarello, C.A.; Wolff, S.M., New Engl. J. Med., 1993,
328, 106). The naturally occurring IL-1β receptor antagonist
has been used to demonstrate the intermediacy of IL-1β in a
number of human diseases and animal models (Hannum, C.H.;
Wilcox, C.J.; Arend, W.P.; Joslin, G.G.; Dripps, D.J.; Heimdal, P.L.;
Armes, L.G.; Sommer, A.; Eisenberg, S.P.; Thompson, R.C.,
Nature, 1990, 343, 336-340; Eisenberg, S.P.; Evans, R.J.;
Arend, W.P.; Verderber, E.; Brewer, M.T.; Hannum, C.H.;
Thompson, R.C., Nature 1990, 343, 341-346; Ohlsson, K.; Bjork,
P.; Bergenfeldt, M.; Hageman, R.; Thompson, R.C., Nature, 1990,
348, 550-552; and Wakabayashi, G., GASEB, 1991, 338-343). 
The specific role of IL-1β in inflammation and immunomodulation
is supported by the recent observation that the
cowpox virus employs an inhibitor of ICE to suppress the
inflammatory response of its host (Ray, C.A. and others,
Cell, 1992, 69, 597-604).The present invention also relates to the modulation of
processing of IL-1β for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Levels of IL-1β are known to be elevated in the synovial fluid
of patients with the disease. Additionally, IL-1β stimulates
the synthesis of enzymes believed to be involved in
inflammation, such as collagenase and PLA2, and produces
joint destruction which is very similar to rheumatoid
arthritis following
