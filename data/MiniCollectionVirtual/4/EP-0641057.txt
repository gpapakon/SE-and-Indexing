<ABSTRACT>
Distribution system for two or more AC loads, there being provided for each load a dedicated assembly module (3) which switches or controls the power to the load. In addition to the assembly modules (3) for the loads (M1, M2), the distribution system comprises a separate measuring and/or control module (22), by means of which measurement signals from the individual assembly modules (3) can be displayed and/or control signals can be output to the individual assembly modules (3).

A distribution system for two or more consumers, in particular
alternating current consumers, which has an assembly carrier (1) with a

heavy-current multipoint connector (4) and a weak-current multipoint
connector (5) and for each consumer a specific assembly module (3) which

switches the current to the consumer and which can be connected by way of
plug connector portions (6a, 6b) to the heavy-current multipoint

connector and the weak-current multipoint connector, characterised in
that besides the assembly modules (3) for the consumers (M1, M2) the

distribution system includes a separate measuring module (22) which has a
display device (23) for displaying measurement signals such as the

current actual value or the current reference value from the individual
assembly modules (3), wherein the measuring module (22) has a change-over

switching device (30) by way of which optionally a given one of the two
or more assembly modules (3) can be selectively interrogated and wherein

similar measuring signals of the various assembly modules (3) can be
displayed selectively one after the other by way of the same display

device (23).
A distribution system according to claim 1 characterised in
that the measuring module (22) has a display (25) which specifies the

assembly module (3) which is just being addressed by way of the change-over
switching device (30).
A distribution system according to one of claims 1 and 2
characterised in that the respective assembly modules (3) each have at

least one measuring output (31) which is connected by way of a measuring
line (32) to an associated measuring input (33) of the measuring module

(22).
A distribution system according to one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that the respective assembly modules each have a change-over

switching unit (36) by way of which various measuring signals can be
selectively applied to a measuring output (31). 
A distribution sytem according to claim 4 characterised in
that the change-over switching unit (36) is controllable from the central

measuring and/or control module (22) by way of a control input (37) at
the assembly module (3).
A distribution system according to one of claims 1 to 5
characterised in that the respective assembly modules (3) each have a

current measuring device which outputs a measurement signal proportional
to the current strength of the current flowing to the consumer.
A distribution system according to one of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that the respective assembly modules each have a current

limiting circuit which above a settable current reference value switches
off the current to the consumer and which outputs a measurement signal

proportional to the current reference value.
A distribution system according to one of claims 1 to 7
characterised in that it includes an assembly carrier (1) having a

plurality of connecting positions for the assembly modules (3) and the
measuring module (22).
A distribution system according to claim 8 characterised in
that the connecting positions in the assembly carrier are connected

together by way of electrical lines, preferably on a bus print.
A distribution system according to claim 8 or claim 9
characterised in that the connecting positions in the assembly carrier

include multi-pole plug connector portions (6a, 6b) and the assembly
modules (3) and the measuring module (22) in turn have plug connector

portions (10a, 10b) which fit together with the plug connector portions
(6a, 6b) in the assembly carrier (1).
A distribution system according to claim 9 and claim 10
characterised in that a first connecting terminal of a plug connector 

portion of the assembly carrier is respectively connected to that
connecting terminal of the adjacent similar plug connector portion which

is adjacent to that connecting terminal of said plug connector portion

which is at the same location as the first connecting terminal in a plug
connector portion.
A distribution system according to one of claims 1 to 11
characterised in that the assembly modules (3) and the separate measuring

module (22) are of the same structural design in regard to the external
dimensions and at least one of the electrical connections.
A distribution system according to one of claims 1 to 12
characterised in that each assembly module (3) has a printed circuit

board (3a) which is preferably disposed vertically when installed and
which is equipped with electronic and electrical components and at the

front side of which is arranged a front plate (14) with operating (17)
and/or display elements (21).
A distribution system according to claim 13 characterised in
that the printed circuit board (3a) is of a single or double Europa card

format.
A distribution system according to one of claims 1 to 14
characterised in that, besides a load portion for switching the current

to the consumer, the assembly modules (3) each have an electronic weak-current
portion which is galvanically separated therefrom and which

performs regulating, control and/or measuring functions at the load
portion (11).
A distribution system according to claim 15 characterised in
that the load portion (11) and the weak-current portion (13) are arranged

on one and the same board, wherein both the lines of the weak-current
portion and also those of the load portion are in the form of conductor

tracks on the board (3a). 
A distribution system according to claim 15 or claim 16
characterised in that the weak-current portion can be connected to a

multipoint connector in the assembly carrier (1) by way of a plug
connector (10b) which is separate from the load plug connector (10a).
