<ABSTRACT>
A fully exchangeable low-profile dual-lumen perfusion 
balloon catheter (10) for dilatation angioplasty 

procedures includes a flexible small diameter guide wire 
(12) in a perfusion lumen (62) of the catheter and is 

provided with an internal guide wire sheath member (30) 
traversing the dilatation balloon (94) and allowing full 

perfusion blood flow via this lumen (62) when the guide 
wire (12) and sheath member (30) are retracted. When the 

guide wire and sheath (30) together are advanced from 
their retracted positions, the sheath member (30) 

positively prevents escape of the guide wire distal end 
(24) from the catheter lumen (62) via the perfusion ports 

(108, 110) thereof. Another embodiment of the invention 
includes a guide wire sheath member (30') with a smaller 

size pilot dilatation balloon (132) and a valving 
structure (144) responsive to axial relative movement of 

the guide wire (12') to allow inflation of this pilot 
balloon (132) in response to communication of pressurized 

fluid to the guide wire sheath member (30') at a proximal 
end thereof. Still another alternative embodiment of the 

inventive catheter includes a guide wire and guide wire 
sheath member (30') which are in one operative 

relationship axially relatively movable and telescopically 
received one within the other. In another operative 

relationship of the guide wire and guide wire sheath 
member, (30') the two are axially aligned and coupled at 

adjacent ends to provide an extended guide structure 
allowing removal of the balloon catheter and retracing of 

the vascular path to the area of treatment. Another 
alternative embodiment of the inventive catheter is 

configured with a mono-rail distal guide portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to the field
of dilatation or balloon catheters employed in the
treatment of vascular diseases. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a dual-lumen low-profile
balloon catheter assembly with perfusion ports
communicating proximally and distally of the dilatation
balloon via a lumen of the catheter. An axially movable
inner guide sheath receives a guide wire assembly for the
catheter. Distal ends of the guide sheath and guide wire
are movable across the perfusion ports in the proximal
direction to allow blood perfusion flow through the full
cross sectional area of the catheter lumen. When the
guide sheath is moved across the perfusion ports in the
distal direction it allows the distal end of the guide
wire to traverse these ports with no possibility that the
wire end will escape through these ports, improving
patient safety.Over the past decade the medical procedure known as
angioplasty has become widely accepted as a safe and
effective method for treating various types of vascular
diseases. For example, angioplasty is widely used for
opening stenoses throughout the vascular system and
particularly for opening stenoses in coronary arteries.At present, the most common form of angioplasty is
called percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
(PTCA). This procedure utilizes a dilatation catheter
having an inflatable balloon at its distal end. By using
a fluoroscope and radiopaque dyes and markers on the
catheter for visualization the distal end of the
dilatation catheter is guided into position through a
guide catheter and across the stenosis. With the
dilatation balloon is in this position of alignment with 
the stenosis the balloon is inflated for a brief duration
to open the artery and establish adequate blood flow.Typically, inflation of the balloon is accomplished
by supplying pressurized fluid from an inflation apparatus
located outside the patient's body through an inflation
lumen in the catheter which communicates with the balloon.
Conversely, applying a negative pressure to the inflation
lumen collapses the balloon to its minimum dimension for
initial placement or for removal of the balloon catheter
from within the blood vessel receiving treatment.In the past years a number of balloon catheter
designs have been developed which have contributed to the
safety and acceptability of PTCA and similar medical
procedures. The most common design is known as an "over-the-wire"
balloon catheter. This conventional device
typically utilizes a relatively
