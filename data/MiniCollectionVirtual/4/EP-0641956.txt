<ABSTRACT>
A torsional damper comprises damper elements 
(22, 24) which are resiliently coupled by a spring 

arrangement (26) and a friction generating device 
(82). One of the damper elements has a radially 

extending wall (84). The friction generating device 
includes a plurality of friction blocks (88) received 

by the other damper element with play in the 

circumferential direction, and a spring (96) arranged 
to bias the plurality of friction blocks (88) against 

the radially extending wall. In order to absorb the 
shock of engagement of each of the plurality of 

friction blocks with the other damper element, a 
cushion (100, 110, 130) is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a torsional 
damper of the type having damper elements resiliently 
coupled by a spring arrangement and a friction 
generating device. United States Patent No. 4,904,225 issued to 
Worner et al., on Feb. 27, 1990 discloses damper 
elements coupled by a spring arrangement. The spring 
arrangement has an intermedaite support which is 
connected resiliently to one damper element by 
long-stroke arcaute helicoidal springs and to the 
other damper element by short-stroke springs. 
Additionally, a friction generating device or slip 
coupling which exibits play is also arranged. The 
friction generating device is operative to generate 
friction resistance which counteracts the movement of 
the damper elements. Japanese Patent Application First Publication 
(JP-A) No. 48-11936 discloses a torsional damper in 
the form of a clutch disc. According to this kown 
torsional damper, there is provided a friction 
generating device which includes a thrust plate 
provided with a plurality of fingers. The plurality 
of fingers are received in windows of a sub-plate and 
have, within the corresponding windows, a play in the 
fircumferential direction. There is need for eliminating noise occurring 
during operation of the friction generating device. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a torsional damper with improved noise free  
 
operational behaviour of a friction generating 
device. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a torsional damper comprising: 
first and second damper elements which are 
resiliently coupled by a spring arrangement;  said first damper element having a radially 
extending wall; and  a friction generating device which includes a 
plurality of friction blocks received by said second 
damper elements with a play in the circumferential 
direction of said second damper element, and a spring 
acting between said first damper element and said 
plurality of friction blocks to bias said plurality 
of friction blocks against said radially extending 
wall of said first damper element, wherein said friction generating device has a 
cushion arranged to absorb the shock of engagement of 
said plurality of friction blocks with said second 
damper element. Fig. 1 is an axial section taken through the 
line 1-1 in Fig. 2, showing a preferred embodiment 
of a torsional damper according to the present 
invention; Fig. 2 is a fragmentary elevational view of the 
torsional damper as seen in the direction of arrow 2
