<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for removing underground contaminants from a contaminated subsurface area (16) is provided. The apparatus includes releasing and/or recovering means in the form of a wellbore (12), which is aligned in the contaminated subsurface area (16) for releasing predetermined substances into selected areas of the contaminated subsurface area (16) so that the substances and contaminants are intermixed and for recovering the intermixture of substances and contaminants from selected areas of the contaminated subsurface area (16). A means (83) is provided for rotating and sliding an inner housing (68) of the wellbore (12). Predetermined substances are injected into the wellbore (12) and vacuum is applied to the wellbore (12) so that the intermixture of substances and contaminants can be extracted from the contaminated area. The intermixture of substances and contaminants are then collected and/or stored for subsequent removal in a tank (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system that is designed to 
completely remove liquid contaminants from landfills and subsurface 
areas. More particularly a system is provided which, by selectively 
and sequentially using a vacuum alone and/or in conjunction 
with heat, water, chemicals or microbes, the removal of 
contaminants is facilitated from discreet "zones" throughout the 
entire length and breadth of a contaminated subsurface area. The contamination of the subsurface area known as the vadose 
zone, which is the zone between the ground and underground water 
cables or aquifers, is a major problem throughout the world. 
Many of these contaminants have been indentified as carcinogens. 
The contamination of the vadose zone is normally the result of 
the leaking of waste dumps; or because of chemical or oil 
spills. This contamination can also be caused by leaking chemicals 
or oil from underground storage tanks. The threat to human 
health occurs when these contaminants are carried by rain water 
into the underground water supply. Volatile liquid contaminants are often removed from subsurface 
areas by excavating the contaminated area and then decontaminating 
it on the surface. There are significant drawbacks and disadvantages 
to this method, however. Not only are these excavation-based 
methods extremely expensive, they have an even greater 
disadvantage in that residents of areas near the contaminated 
sites often raise objections to the above ground excavation 
of polluted soil in their neighborhoods. Another more recent problem is associated with landfills to 
which toxic-chemicals are transported for burial after they have 
been excavated. These chemicals normally include some very mobile 
contaminants and often these mobile contaminants will diffuse 
into the barriers of the landfills thereby breaking through  
 
into the vadose zone over drinking water aquifers. Because of 
this additional problem, it now makes it even more difficult to 
excavate contaminated sites and ship them off for reburial in 
supposedly secure landfill sites. Because of these problems, reclamation 
will have to be done on or in the site, that is, "in-situ". 
It also means that the landfills themselves, most of 
which are very deep, will have to be decontaminated "in situ". Clearly, what is needed is a reliable and efficient method of 
cleaning up the toxic chemicals, oil and gasoline "in situ". There have been a number of systems and methods developed for in 
situ removal of pollutants. One such 
system and method
