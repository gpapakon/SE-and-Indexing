<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an alpine ski binding comprising, a base (3) joined to the ski, a body (2) mounted on the base, a jaw (4) for holding the boot carried by the body, an energy spring (15) housed in the body to elastically oppose the opening movements of the jaw in response to the stresses of the boot and a support plate (26) on which the boot sole rests. It is characterised in that the support plate (26) is movable in terms of a rolling (rocking) movement and in that the linking means (36, 43) which are sensitive to the rolling movements of the support plate join the support plate to one of the movable members of the binding to lower the resistance force which the boot has to overcome in order to be freed by the jaw in response to a rolling stress exerted on the support plate.

<CLAIMS>
Binding element for alpine skis comprising the following 
elements, 


a base (3, 83) adapted to be connected to the ski, 
a body (2, 82) mounted on the base, 
a boot retention jaw (4, 84) borne by the body, 
the jaw comprising two lateral retention wings of the boot 
and a vertical retaining solo clamp, 
an energy spring (15, 85) housed in the body for elastically 
opposing the opening movements at the jaw in response to the biases 

of the boot, 
a support plate (26, 96) on which the sole of the boot 
rests, 
 
   characterised by the fact that the support plate (26, 96) is 

mobile for a rolling movement, and that the linkage means (36, 43, 
99, 100, 110, 90), sensitive to the rolling movements of the 

support plate, connect the support plate to one of the mobile 
members of the binding element for reducing the resistance force 

that the boot must overcome to be released tram the jaw, in 
response to a rolling bias exerted on the support plate. 
Binding element according to claim 1, characterised by the 
fact that the support plate (26, 96) is journalled about a parallel 

axis in the longitudinal direction of the ski. 
Binding element according to claim 2, characterised by the 
fact that the journal axis of the support plate (26) is 

substantially offset along the side with respect to the median 
longitudinal direction. 
Binding element according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the support plate (26) is journalled about an axis 

oriented substantially obliquely with respect to the longitudinal 
direction of the ski. 
Binding element according to claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the linkage means are connected to the return spring (15,  

 
85) of the jaw or to the means (16, 90) by which the spring exerts 

is return action on the jaw (4, 84). 
Binding element according to claim 1, characterised by the 
fact that the support plate (26) activates a pedal (36) journalled 

about a horizontal and transverse axis (38). 
Binding element according to claim 6, characterised by the 
fact that the support plate (26) is superposed to the pedal (36), 

that the support zones at the support plate on the pedal are offset 
with respect to the journal axis of the pedal, so that a rolling 

motion of the support plate induces a vertical movement of the 
pedal. 
Binding element according to claim 7, characterised by the 
fact that the end at the pedal (26) opposite its journal is in 

support on a first arm of a journalled rocking element (43) in 
which the other arm is connected to the return spring of the jaw. 
Binding element according to claim 5, characterised by the 
fact that the linkage means comprise two transverse connecting rods 

(99, 100) journalled about vertical axes, which are connected to 
the support plate by an assembly of the complimentary ramps (105, 

106, 107) that are in support against a pusher (110) guided along 
a longitudinal direction.
