<ABSTRACT>
A compression operated fuel injector assembly (1) for an internal combustion engine. The injector assembly (1) has a body (2) with a bore (8) having a gas passage (9) at one end for communication with an engine combustion chamber. A piston (7) is slidable in the bore (8). A fuel pump (5) is mounted within the body (2) having a plunger (14) which is mounted on the piston (7) for reciprocal pumping movement within a complementary fuel pump cyclinder (15) for delivery of fuel to a nozzle assembly (6). The nozzle assembly (6) is mounted on the piston (7) and projects through the gas passage (9). The piston (7) is urged downwardly by a timing spring (16) so that a valve head (18) on the nozzle assembly (6) engages a valve seat (19) until the pressure of combustion chamber gases acting on the outer portion of the nozzle (6) is sufficient to overcome spring pressure and move the piston (7) upwardly opening the passage (9) to the piston (7) so that the gases snap the piston (7) upwardly due to the increased area exposed to the gases. Collets (20) at an outer end of the gas passageway (9) form a gas tight seal with a second valve head (21) on the nozzle assembly (6) when the piston (7) snaps inwardly to retain purging air within the bore (8) and seal the bore (8) during combustion to exclude combustion gases. When cylinder pressure drops at the end of the power stroke the spring (16) moves the piston (7) outwardly to blow down the purging air into the cylinder for improved scavenging.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fuel injector assembly for the 
injection of fuel into a combustion chamber of an internal 
combustion engine and in particular to cylinder 
compression pressure actuated fuel injector assemblies. Examples of pressure actuated fuel injector assemblies are 
shown in Patent Specification No's DE 661,468, DE 688,311, 
DE 708,739, FR 799,951, FR 849,154, US 2,589,505, US 
2,602,702, US 2,740,667 and US 2,740,668. Such cylinder 
pressure fuel injector assemblies have considerable 
advantages particulary for 2-stroke engines. These are 
sometimes erroneously referred to as pumpless diesel 
injector units. Cheap, small displacement, internal-combustion 
engines working on the compression ignition 
principle have been much sought after for many years. 
Cost is a major factor in the almost total absence of the 
availability of small diesel engines except for 
specialised applications where cost is a secondary factor. 
Efforts to design and develop a low cost fuel injector 
assembly, which would be actuated by combustion chamber 
pressure has heretofore proved unsuccessful. The 
aforementioned patent specifications demonstrate quite 
clearly that this problem has been long appreciated and 
that the way forward was to combine together within the 
injector assembly unit itself the pumping function. Thus, 
the so called pumpless diesel injector unit. It is long 
recognised, as these patent specifications adequately 
demonstrate, that some form of pump could be provided 
which could be readily easily actuated in this manner. 
Unfortunately, all these fuel injector assemblies suffered 
from serious drawbacks. A primary drawback is that there 
was very often, if one was to get efficient combustion, a 
need to provide a secondary combustion chamber. In many 
cases the injection pressures were not sufficient to have  
 
the injection operation carried out at pressures 
equivalent to those of more conventional separate pump and 
injector units. These units as will be referred to again 
below also had a major disadvantage in respect of 
contamination by the combustion gases. There were other 
problems with priming and efficiency generally. Many attempts were made to overcome the problems of 
injection pressure and general fuel atomisation. This problem of injection pressure and atomisation was 
overcome many years ago by what was in effect a 2-stage 
lift injection process. When this solution to the 
problem, which was first disclosed in DE 688311, was 
achieved the remaining problems were such
