<ABSTRACT>
An optical disc discriminating system comprises tracking
error signal generating means (7) adapted to generate a

tracking error signal whose amplitude level varies with a
groove depth of information tracks on an optical disc;

tracking servo means (1, 2) for directing a laser beam
along an information track on the optical disc in

accordance with the tracking error signal and a comparator
(16) adapted to compare the amplitude level of the tracking

error signal with a reference level, when a tracking servo
loop of the tracking servo means is in an opened condition.

Discriminating means (17, 18) are provided to discriminate
the first and second groups of optical discs in accordance

with a result from the comparator (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disc
discriminating system, in particular to a system for
discriminating a read-only disc such as a DVD-ROM (Digital
Video Disc-Read Only Memory) and a writable disc such as a
DVD-R (Digital Video Disc-Recordable).Fig. 7 indicates a conventional system for discriminating
the types of different optical discs to determine if it is a
read-only disc such as a CD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read Only
Memory) or a writable disc such as a CD-R (Compact Disc-Recordable).In Fig. 7, a reference character D is an optical disc to
be discriminated, 101 is an optical pickup, 102 is a spindle
motor for rotating the optical disc D, 103 is a motor control
circuit for controlling the rotation of the spindle motor 102,
104 is a head amplifier, 105 is a servo circuit, 106 is an
information pit detector, 107 is a CPU (Central Processing
Unit).The optical disc D to be discriminated is mounted on a
turntable (not shown) of the spindle motor 102 which rotates
in accordance with a control signal from the motor control
circuit 103. The motor control circuit 103, in accordance
with a command from the CPU 107, compares a pulse signal (FG) 
having a frequency proportional to the motor rotation speed,
with another pulse signal (FG) indicating a rotation speed
previously set by a setting section 171 of the CPU 107, so as
to produce a frequency difference between these two pulse
signals. Then, a control signal for rendering the frequency
difference to become zero is fed to the spindle motor 102.
In this manner, a servo loop is formed for controlling the
rotation of the optical disc D. Therefore, the optical disc D
which is to be discriminated later, is controllably rotated at
a speed previously set by the CPU 107.On the other hand, a laser beam irradiating from the
optical pickup 101 is reflected on the recording surface of
the optical disc D (to be discriminated), a reflection
diffraction light bearing the information from the optical
disc D is received by a photodetector (not shown) of the
optical pickup 101. Then, the reflection diffraction light
is converted into an electric signal to be fed to the head
amplifier 104. The head amplifier 104 processes the above
electric signal so as to first produce and then amplify a RF
signal and an error signal to be used in focusing
control/tracking control. The amplified signals are fed to
the servo circuit 105 and the information pit detector 106.
The servo circuit 105, in view of an error signal applied
hereto and in accordance with an command from the CPU

predetermined frequency and has prepits (34) formed 
between adjacent tracks on the optical disc, so that the

discriminating system further comprises:

an extractor (15) for extracting the above wobble signal
