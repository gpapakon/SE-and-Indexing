<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of treating residues (1) coming from effluents of plants for incinerating household waste and similar waste (residues), in particular so-called fly ash coming from the electrostatic filtration treatment and/or from the residues from neutralising the flue gases by lime treatment, characterised in that the said materials (1) coming from the effluents are washed (at 11), separating, using a filter (9), on the one hand a solution (13) containing the majority of the soluble salts, principally calcium chloride, and on the other hand a filter cake (15) stripped to a large extent of the soluble salts, the washing water (11) being continuously recycled, while at the same time taking off a purge (19) which is concentrated with soluble salts. According to the invention, the solution, rich in calcium chloride, obtained is suitable for purifying, from sulphates and phosphates, waste water, especially urban waste water.

Process for processing residues (1) containing 
calcium chloride from incinerator effluents for household 

refuse and similar, particularly the so-called fly ashes 
from an electrofiltration process, and/or residues for fume 

neutralization by lime treatment, characterized in that a 
residue (1) lixiviation step (3) is carried out through a 

recycled solution (5) containing soluble salts by producing 
a suspension (7) which is submitted to a filtration and a 

washing with water supply (11) by separating through a 
filter (9), on one hand, a solution (13) containing most of 

the soluble salts and mainly the calcium chloride and, on 
the other hand, a filtration cake (15) cleared mostly from 

the soluble salts, the washing waters (11) being recycled 
continuously while taking out a purge (19) rich in soluble 

salts. 
Process for processing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the concentration in soluble salts 

and particularly in calcium, sodium and potassium 
chlorides, is comprised between 150 and 400 g/l in the 

purge (19). 
Process for processing according to claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the composition of starting 

materials (1) comprises a mixture of fly ashes and 
neutralization residues containing 8 to 36% soluble salts. 
Process for filtering according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the soluble salts  

 
in the filtration cake (15) are fixed chemically by adding 

an hydraulic binder, particularly an aluminous cement. 
Use of the calcium chloride rich solution from 
the process according to any of the preceding claims so as 

to precipitate sulfates and phosphates from the refuse 
waters. 
Use of the calcium chloride rich solution from 
the process according to any of the claims 1 to 4 as an 

antidust, as a fluid in cooling circuits and as an adjuvant 
in concretes.
