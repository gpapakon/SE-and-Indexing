<ABSTRACT>
An improved memory system for use in a data 
processing system has two memory banks (30,31) and 

corresponding error correction circuitry (34,35) 
associated with each. Data words of a block thereof 

are stored in the memory banks in an interleaved fashion 
wherein alternating words are stored in one bank and the 

intervening alternating words are stored in the other 
bank. During a WRITE operation the memory is 

controlled so that the first data word of a block 
stored in a memory bank uses a late write technique, and 

all subsequent data words thereof use an early write 
technique. During a READ operation, pairs of data 

words are read and checked for errors simultaneously, 
and are then supplied in a pipelined manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The attention is drawn to the fact that this is a Divisional Application 
of Patent European Application No. 90301393.6 This invention relates generally to memory 
systems for use in data processing systems and, more 
particularly, to memory systems which use multiple banks 
of memory modules. In general, when using multiple banks of memory 
modules in a memory system of a data processor, in order 
to access such memory banks to perform read and write 
operations, information which is being transferred to or 
from the memory system is often transferred in the form of 
multiple data word blocks. For example, it is common to 
transfer information in blocks of four 32-bit data words, 
either for writing into or reading from the memory 
modules. A conventional approach to such a data transfer 
operation is to utilize four banks of memory modules and 
to access one of the four words from each memory module 
bank in sequence. During each read access, for example, 
error detection and correction logic is utilized in 
association with each module bank in order to check the 
data words involved for single or multiple bit errors. The overall performance for such a conventional 
approach is acceptable when using high speed memory 
systems, but at a cost which is commensurate with the 
number and the quality of the components which are used 
therein. It is desirable in some applications to achieve 
equivalent performance at a lower cost by using fewer 
components and lower speed memory modules than those 
required in current systems. United States patent US-A-4 323 965 describes 
the use of dual memory banks for storing data words, with  
 
error correction units associated with each. Two words 
are simultaneously accessed, one from each memory bank, 
and simultaneously supplied to a multi-word bus. Our United States patent US-A-3 931 613 
describes an "overlap fetch" operation, in which the 
fetching of a word from a second memory can be started 
before the data transfer of a word from a first memory has 
been completed. The system also uses memory interleaving 
techniques. The invention is defined in the appended claims 
to which reference should now be made. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of 
the invention, a memory comprising multiple banks is 
arranged to provide a different and unique combination of 
interleaving and pipelining of the data words in a block 
thereof such that a "write" uses both late write and early 
write operations in the same data transfer and a read from 
a memory bank is

<CLAIMS>
A memory system for use in a data processing 
system comprising: 


two memory banks (30,31) for storing data 
words; 
an error detection and correction means (34,35) 
associated with each of said two memory banks; 
means (32,33,36,37) for writing into, or 
reading from, a first one of said two memory banks, alternating data 

words of a multi-word data block, and for writing into or 
reading from a second one of said two memory banks the 

intervening data words of said multi-word data block; and 
means (25) for performing the transfer of said 
multi-words in a data block thereof so that said 

alternating and intervening words are written into or read 
from said two memory banks in an interleaved manner; 
 
   characterised in that data words of a multi-word 

data block are read from said two memory banks in a 
pipelined manner such that, with respect to each 

successive pair of data words of said data block, the 
first data word of each pair is read from said first memory 

bank and made available for a requester and the second 
data word is read from said second memory bank 

simultaneously with the reading of said first data word 
but is retained and made available for a requester after 

the first data word has been made available, the data 
words when read from said two memory banks being supplied to 

the error detecting and correction means associated with 
each said memory bank, respectively.  

 
A memory system in accordance with claim 1 
wherein, if an error is detected in any data word during a 

read operation, the read operation is delayed by a 
selected time period until said error is corrected, said 

read operation resuming after said selected time period. 
A memory system in accordance with claim 1 or 
2, wherein said data block comprises four data words DATA 

0 to DATA 3, the data words DATA 0 and DATA 2 being 
written into or read from said first memory bank and the 

data words DATA 1 and DATA 3 being written into or read 
from said second memory bank. 
A memory system in accordance with claim 1 or 
2, wherein said data block comprises eight data words DATA

DATA 6 being written into or read from said first memory 

bank and the data words DATA 1, DATA 3, DATA 5 and DATA 7 
being written into or read from said second memory bank. 
A method for writing a block of multiple data 
words into or reading a block of data words from two 

memory banks comprising the steps of: 

writing into, or reading from, a first one of said two 
memory banks, alternating data words of said block of data 

words; and 
writing into, or reading from, a second one of 
said two memory banks, intervening data words of said block of

read simultaneously, one from each of said two memory banks; the data 
words of each said pair thereof are checked for errors 

when read; the data word of each pair read from the first one of 
said memory two banks is immediately supplied when read; and the data 

word of each pair read from a second one of said two memory banks 
is retained and supplied after the data word from said first 

memory bank has been supplied, the data words when read from 
said two memory banks being supplied to the error detection and 

correction means associated with each memory bank. 
A method in accordance with claim 5, further 
comprising the step of delaying the reading of data words 

from said two memory banks by a selected time period when an 
error has been detected on a data word to permit said 

error to be corrected.
