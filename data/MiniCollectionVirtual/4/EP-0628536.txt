A process for preparing aromatic amines by reacting
aromatic amides with halogens or hypohalites in

aqueous-alkaline solutions and/or suspensions by a
Hofmann degradation reaction, which comprises carrying

out the reaction in the presence of (C
1
-C
8
)-alkanols
or benzyl alcohols at from -15 to 80°C and

converting the reaction products into amines by
hydrolysis, hydrogenation or reductive methods.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
aromatic radical is phenyl, naphthyl or heteroaryl

which is optionally substituted by an arbitrary
number of chlorine, fluorine or bromine atoms, or

trifluoromethyl, nitro, cyano, carboxyl, (C
1
-C
4
)-alkoxycarbonyl,
(C
1
-C
4
)-alkyl or (C
1
-C
4
)-alkoxy
groups.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
amides are reacted in aqueous-alkaline media with

chlorine, bromine, sodium hypochlorite or sodium
hypobromite in quantities of from 1 to 5 mol, in

particular of from 1.01 to 2 mol, preferably of from
1.02 to 1.2 mol, per mole of amide.
The process as claimed in claim 3, wherein active
chlorine is used in quantities of from 30 to 250, in

particular of from 100 to 160 g, and active bromine
in quantities of from 60 to 550, in particular of

from 200 to 350 g, per kg of aqueous solution. 
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 4, wherein the amides are reacted at temperatures

of from 0°C to 50°C, in particular of from 10°C to
40°C.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 5, wherein (C
1
-C
8
)-alkanols, which can be
substituted by one to three (C
1
-C
4
)-alkoxy groups,
fluorine, chlorine, bromine atoms, nitro groups,

cyano groups, trifluoromethyl groups or (C
1
-C
4
)-alkoxycarbonyl
groups, are employed, in particular

primary alcohols, preferably methanol and ethanol.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 5, wherein benzyl alcohols, whose phenyl radical

can be substituted by one to three (C
1
-C
4
)-alkyl
groups, (C
1
-C
4
)-alkoxy groups, fluorine, chlorine or
bromine atoms, nitro groups, cyano groups, trifluoromethyl

groups or (C
1
-C
4
)-alkoxycarbonyl
groups, are employed.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 7, wherein alcohols are employed in quantities of

from 1 to 20 mol, in particular of from 1.1 to
10 mol, preferably of from 1.05 to 5 mol, per mole

of amide.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 8, wherein aqueous solutions or suspensions of

alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides,
carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, phosphates,

hydrogen phosphates, dihydrogen phosphates or
oxides, or mixtures of these compounds, in

particular sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide,
are used.
The process as claimed in at least one of claims 1
to 9, wherein 2,6-difluorobenzamide is converted

into 2,6-difluoroaniline.
