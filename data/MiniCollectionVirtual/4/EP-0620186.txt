<ABSTRACT>
The reactor has a plurality of gas-permeable plates (5, 6) which form reaction stages which are connected by overflow lines (5a, 6a). An annular duct (9) serving for gas distribution is arranged on at least one plate. The outer wall (9a) and the inner wall (9b) of the annular duct have numerous gas outlet orifices (19b). At least one vertical gas feed tube (10, 11) open at both ends and proceeding from the plate is arranged in the annular duct. The upper end of the gas feed tube is enclosed by a bell-like cap (14, 15) connected to the annular duct, so that a space through which gases can flow remains between the gas feed tube and the cap.

<CLAIMS>
A reactor (1) for reacting alkali chlorate 
with acid, particularly hydrochloric acid, to prepare an 

aqueous mixture of chlorine dioxide and chlorine, which reactor 
comprises a plurality of gas-permeable plates (5, 6), 

which define reaction levels, which are interconnected by 
overflow lines (5a, 6a), characterized in that an annular 

duct (9), which serves to distribute gas, is provided on at 
least one plate and is provided in its outer wall (9a) with 

gas exit openings (19a) directed toward the outer edge of 
the plate (5) and in its inner wall (9b) with gas exit openings 

(19b) directed towards the centre of the plate, that at 
least one vertical gas-conducting tube (10, 11), which is 

open at both ends, is disposed in the annular duct (9) and 
extends from the plate and at its top end is surrounded by 

a bell-like cap (14, 15), which is connected to the annular 
duct, and that the diameter of the inner wall (9b) of the 

annular duct is 0.1 to 0.7 time the diameter of the outer 
edge of the plate. 
A reactor according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the annular duct (9) is provided with at least two 

gas-conducting tubes (10, 11) and associated caps (14, 15).
