<ABSTRACT>
A video system comprises a video display (244) having a 
wide format display ratio for displaying a video signal. A signal 

processor (304) has an interpolator (337) and a first in first out 
line memory (356) having asynchronous write and read ports for 

selectably expanding and compressing a picture represented by 
data in the video signal. The picture is cropped to define a subset 

of the picture for display by controlling writing of the data into 
the line memory. A microprocessor (340) provides control 

signals with selectable time durations and selectable phases 
relative to a synchronizing component of said video signal for 

selecting boundaries of the subset of the picture for display. The 
microprocessor can select the time durations and the phases 

responsive to user commands.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of televisions capable of
displaying zoomed and/or cropped pictures, and in particular, to
methods and apparatus for horizontally panning such zoomed or
cropped pictures in televisions having a wide display format ratio
screen. Most televisions today have a format display ratio,
horizontal width to vertical height, of 4:3. A wide format display
ratio corresponds more closely to the display format ratio of
movies, for example 16:9. The invention is applicable to both direct
view televisions and projection televisions.Televisions having a format display ratio of 4:3, often referred
to as 4 X 3, are limited in the ways that single and multiple video
signal sources can be displayed. Television signal transmissions of
commercial broadcasters, except for experimental material, are
broadcast with a 4 X 3 format display ratio. Many viewers find the
4 X 3 display format less pleasing than the wider format display
ratio associated with the movies. Televisions with a wide format
display ratio provide not only a more pleasing display, but are
capable of displaying wide display format signal sources in a
corresponding wide display format. Movies "look" like movies, not
cropped or distorted versions thereof. The video source need not be
cropped, either when converted from film to video, for example with
a telecine device, or by processors in the television.Televisions with a wide display format ratio are also suited to
a wide variety of displays for both conventional and wide display
format signals, as well as combinations thereof in multiple picture
displays. However, the use of a wide display ratio screen entails
numerous problems. Changing the display format ratios of multiple
signal sources, developing consistent timing signals from
asynchronous but simultaneously displayed sources, switching
between multiple sources to generate multiple picture displays, and
providing high resolution pictures from compressed data signals are
general categories of such problems. Such problems are solved in a
wide screen television according to this invention. A wide screen
television according to various inventive arrangements is capable of
providing high resolution, single and multiple picture displays, from 
single and multiple sources having similar or different format
ratios, and with selectable display format ratios.Televisions with a wide display format ratio can be
implemented in television systems displaying video signals both at
basic or standard horizontal scanning rates and multiples
