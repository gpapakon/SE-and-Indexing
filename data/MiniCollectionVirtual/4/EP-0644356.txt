<ABSTRACT>
Automatic gear-change mechanism with three sets of gearing comprising, inside a casing (26), a primary shaft (3) bearing three step-down gears (5, 6, 7) which act on respectively a first planet pinion (12), a second planet pinion (14) and the planet carrier (11) of an epicyclic gear chain (17) borne by a secondary shaft (8) parallel to the primary shaft (3), characterised in that it includes a first clutch (22) borne by the primary shaft (3) and allowing the first step-down gear (5) to be immobilised relative to this shaft, a second clutch (23) borne by the secondary shaft (8) allowing the second step-down gear (6) to be coupled to a planet (14), and a third clutch (24) borne by the primary shaft (3) allowing the first step-down gear (7) to be immobilised on this shaft.
