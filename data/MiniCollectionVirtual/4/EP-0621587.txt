<ABSTRACT>
A device for driving an objective lens and other optical parts according to the displacement of a disc. A movable part on 
which optical parts are mounted is supported by two or more flat springs which are arranged not in parallel to the disc, and is 

driven in the focusing direction and the tracking direction. The flat springs can be the ones having a wiring function so that any 
wire lead-out from the movable part can be eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical drive
device provided in an optical recording and reproduction
apparatus for driving optical component parts, such as an
objective lens, in accordance with displacement of a disk.
Particularly, the present invention relates to a device for
driving optical component parts that includes plate springs
which are used to drive the optical component parts in
focusing and tracking directions, and which may have an
electric wiring function, the drive device thus being made
simple and made to include a mobile body of reduced weight,
so as to be capable of stably driving the optical component
parts at high speed.A conventional optical recording and reproduction
apparatus has an optical component parts drive device of
varying type in which plate springs are employed. In such
an optical component parts drive device, two pairs of plate
springs support a mobile body, as disclosed, for example, in
Japanese Patent Publication No. 62-20903.In this example, however, it is essential to provide
intermediary supporting members in order to tie together the
two pairs of plate springs which are in turn necessary to 
support the mobile body in such a manner that the mobile body can be moved in two
directions. This requirement hinders the weight of the mobile body from being reduced.
In addition, the complicated structure makes dynamic characteristics unstable.Another known optical component parts drive device employing plate springs is
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 1-118224, in which a mobile body is
supported by a pair of support arms each formed by a plate spring having two end
portions parallel to a disk and secured to a support structure and a middle section
perpendicular to the disk and secured to the mobile body. Each of the plate springs is
twisted through 90° at two locations between the centre section and a respective one of
its ends. This document is reflecting the preamble of claim 1.Another known optical component parts drive device employing plate springs is
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 2-5117, in which two plate springs
support a mobile body, the plate springs being secured at one end to a support structure
and at the other end to the mobile body with the ends of the springs connected to the
support structure being parallel to a disk. In a first embodiment the ends of the plate
springs connected to the mobile body are perpendicular to the surface of the disk and the
plate springs are twisted through 90° at one location along their
