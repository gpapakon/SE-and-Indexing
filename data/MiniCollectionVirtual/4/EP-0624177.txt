<ABSTRACT>
Ionomers derived from ethylene/methacrylic acid or ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers, containing high levels of acid neutralized with lithium, zinc and sodium are blended in defined amounts to form compositions with very high resilience. The compositions are highly suitable for use as golf ball covers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ionomeric compositions which have 
high resilience, and more specifically it relates to such compositions formed 
from ethylene/methacrylic acid or acrylic acid based copolymers with high 
levels of acid, neutralized with lithium, zinc and optionally sodium ions. The 
compositions are particularly useful as golf ball covers. Golf ball covers made from ionomers based on 
ethylene/methacrylic acid or acrylic acid are known in the prior art and have 
long been used commercially. Many properties are essential in a cover material. Covers 
must be adequately tough over a range of temperatures and must be 
durable. Beyond these essentials however, certain other characteristics of 
the cover material are desirable. While both the center and windings of a 
three-piece ball and the core of a two-piece ball are major determinants of 
the playing characteristics of a golf ball, the cover too plays a significant role. 
A key property which has long been recognized as a guide to obtaining 
better cover materials is the resilience of the material. This is often assessed 
by measurement of the coefficient of restitution (COR). There is an ever continuing search for materials with the 
highest possible COR, combined with adequate toughness and durability, for 
use as covers for golf balls. This search however has revealed divergent, 
even contradictory trends, or mere broad generalities with regard to which 
acid, at what level, whether a single metal ionomer or a blend of two three 
or more metal ionomers should be blended, and how much of each are best, 
as can be seen from the following references. U.S Patent No. 3,819,768 (Molitor), discloses that when golf 
balls with the same core are covered with a blend of sodium and zinc 
ionomer, sodium ionomer alone or zinc ionomer alone, the blend gives a  
 
ball with a higher COR than either alone. In other words a synergistic effect 
is taught when using zinc and sodium together. Research Disclosure Journal Article #27103, published by 
Kenneth Mason Publications Ltd., November 1986, and disclosed by E. I. 
du Pont de Nemours & Company, discloses that lithium ionomers can be 
used to produce golf ball shells (covers) which can be used to produce golf 
balls with superior properties, including coefficient of restitution, to shells 
made of sodium or zinc ionomers. It is also disclosed that lithium ionomers 
can be used in blends with other ionomers where they can impart better cut 
resistance to these other materials. U.S. Patent No. 5,000,459

<CLAIMS>
A composition comprising a neutralized ethylene-acid copolymer, 
a neutralized blend of ethylene-acid copolymers or a blend of 

neutralized ethylene-acid copolymers wherein the acid is methacrylic 
acid or acrylic acid and wherein the average weight percent acid 

in the composition before neutralization is from 18 to 25%, and 
wherein at least 30% of the acid groups in the composition are 

neutralized with metal ions, comprising 

(A) 20-90% equivalents of lithium ions 
(B) 5-40% equivalents of zinc ions and 
(C) 0-55% equivalents of sodium ions based on the total number 
of equivalents of metal ions present, with the proviso that 

the coefficient of restitution is greater than 0.700, 
the coefficient of restitution being the return velocity 

divided by the initial velocity and measured by firing 
a sphere of the ionomer from an air cannon at an initial 

velocity of 54.8 m/s (180 ft./sec.) as measured using 
a speed monitoring device over a distance of 0.9 to 1.8 m (3 to 6 feet) 

from the cannon, the sphere striking a 
steel plate positioned 2.74 m (9 feet) away from the cannon 

and rebounding through the speed monitoring device. 
The composition of claim 1 comprising a blend of ionomers 
comprising 


(A) 20-90 wt.% lithium ionomer 
(B) 5-50 wt.% zinc ionomer and 
(C) 0-55 wt.% sodium ionomer. 
The composition of claim 2 comprising a blend of ionomers 
comprising 


(A) 30-90 wt.% lithium ionomer 
(B) 15-40 wt. % zinc ionomer and 
(C) 0-45 wt. % sodium ionomer. 
The composition of claim 2 comprising a blend of ionomers 
comprising 


(A) 40-80 wt.% lithium ionomer 
(B) 20-40 wt.% zinc ionomer and 
(C) 0-40 wt.% sodium ionomer 
The composition of claim 3 wherein the melt index of the blend is 
less than 10.  

 
The composition of claim 1 wherein the coefficient of 
restitution is greater than 0.715. 
The composition of claim 2 wherein 45 - 70 % of the acid 
groups are neutralized. 
A golf ball cover comprising the composition of claim 1 or 
2. 
A golf ball comprising a core and a cover wherein the 
cover material comprises the composition of claim 1 or 2.
