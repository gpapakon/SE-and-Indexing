<ABSTRACT>
A system is described for the control of an actuator for adjusting the air supply of a motor vehicle engine. The said system essentially comprises two sub-assemblies, the first sub-assembly being assigned to the accelerator pedal and the second sub-assembly to the actuator. The two sub-assemblies are connected to one another by way of a single communications line. In addition one sub-assembly is connected to a communications channel or a bus system. Such a system according to the invention is especially simple and cost-effective to manufacture and is particularly flexible with regard to modifications and extensions. In addition emergency running and monitoring functions can be easily implemented.
