<ABSTRACT>
Distributor (dispensing) box for a mechanical seed-spacing drill including a fixed casing (1) and a rotor (3) equipped with a ring (8) in which cells (20) are made. It includes a disc (2) coaxial with the rotor (3) and fixed between the said rotor and the end of the casing (1) making an internal bearing face (9). An outside diameter of the disc is less than the inside diameter of the casing in order to delimit an annular passage receiving the ring (8); the disc has a notch equipped with a horizontal selection device.

<CLAIMS>
A distribution box for a mechanical seed spacing drill, of 
the type comprising a fixed casing (1) delimited by a 

substantially vertical base and a cylindrical wall (25) and 
a rotor (3) arranged in the casing (1) at the level of the 

cylindrical wall (25) and mounted for rotation in the 
cylindrical wall (25), the rotor (3) having a peripheral 

cylindrical collar (8) directed towards the inside of the 
casing (1) and in which are arranged cells (20), each of 

which is intended to receive a seed and opens, on the one 
hand, on the outside of the collar (8) and, on the other 

hand, on the inside of the collar (8), characterised in that 
it has an element (2) having the general shape of a disc 

coaxial with the rotor (3) and fixed between the rotor (3) 
and the base of the casing (1), in that the casing (1) has, 

on a portion of its periphery, a peripheral inner supporting 
surface (9) connected and orthogonal to the cylindrical wall 

(25) on which the disc (2) is supported, in that the 
external diameter of the disc (2) is less than the internal 

diameter of the casing (1) at the level of the supporting 
surface (9), so as to delimit, with the supporting surface 

(9) and the cylindrical wall (25) of the casing, an annular 
channel (7) receiving the cylindrical collar (8) of the 

rotor (3), in that the disc (2) has a cut-out (16) in its 
portion arranged in the area for raising the seeds locked in 

the cells (20), and in that a selection device (17, 19) 
intended to expel the additional seeds (22a) carried along 

by the cells (20) is provided at the level of the exit end 
of the cut-out (16). 
A distribution box according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the selection device (17, 19) is arranged on the di
sc 
(2).  

 
A distribution box according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the selection device is constituted by a ramp (17), the 

slope of which is substantially perpendicular to the radius 
of the disc (2), extending from the exit edge (19) of the 

cut-out (16) on the surface (33) of the disc turned towards 
the rotor (3) to the surface (34) of the disc turned towards 

the casing (1) so as to present a substantially radial ridge 
(19) on the surface of the disc (2) facing the rotor (3). 
A distribution box according to claim 3, characterised in 
that it comprises a second device (18) for selecting excess 

seeds from each cell (20) arranged substantially in the 
upper portion of the casing (1). 
A distribution box according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the supporting surface (9) of the casing extends from 

the top portion to the seed ejection portion (13). 
A distribution box according to claims 4 and 5, 
characterised in that the additional selection device is 

constituted by a ramp (18) arranged at the upper end of the 
supporting surface (9) of the casing (1). 
A distribution box according to claim 1, characterised in 
that each cell (20) of the rotor comprises a ramp, 

preferably oblique (21) at its front end in the direction of 
movement of the rotor (3).
