<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention the tab (7) for connecting the panels (2, 3) consists of an extruded tubular section including, between two lateral box structures (7a) joined by a web of material (7b), a central groove (15) with parallel lateral faces emerging at the outside through the gap (I) between two panels (2, 3), where the weather strip (9) is integral with a longitudinal central leaf (13) projecting perpendicularly to its internal face and including, at its free end, at least one bead (14) designed to snap-fasten elastically with at least two ribs opposite each other, projecting from the faces opposite each other of the central groove (15) of the tab (7).

Impermeable coupling device for laminated roof
panels, comprising:


a tenon (7) which is rectangular in cross-section
and the longitudinal edges of which are

inserted into longitudinal mortises (8) which open into
the narrow edges of the cores of two contiguous

laminated panels (2, 3),
a capping (9) which extends longitudinally and
on either side of the gap (I) between the two panels

(2, 3),
seals (12) between the capping (9) and the
external faces of the panels (2, 3),
and means (14, 25) of the capping that are
inserted into the gap (I) between panels (2, 3) and

cooperate with complementary means (16a, 26) of the
tenon (7) in order to ensure the coupling of the

capping (9) with the tenon (7),

   characterised in that the tenon (7) for coupling
the panels (2, 3) is made up of an extruded tubular

profile comprising, between two lateral caissons (7a)
which are joined by a web of material (7b), a central

recess (15, 15a) which has parallel lateral faces and
is open towards the outside across the gap (I) between

two panels (2, 3), while the capping (9) is in one
piece with a longitudinal central lamina (13) which

projects perpendicularly from the inner face of said

capping and comprises, at its free end, at least one
bead (14, 25) which is suitable for locking elastically

with at least two opposing ribs (16a, 25 (sic)) which
project from opposing faces of the central recess (15,

15a) of the tenon (7).
Impermeable coupling device according to claim
1, characterised in that the two ribs of the tenon (7)

onto which the bead (14) of the lamina (13) of the
capping (9) locks are made up of the free opposing 

edges (16a) of two fins (16), each of which projects
from one of the opposing faces of the central recess,

these free edges being separated by a distance (d)
which is at least smaller than the transverse thickness

of the bead (14).
Device according to claim 2, characterised in
that each of the fins (16) is in one piece, at its edge

which is opposite its free edge, with the outer edge of
the central recess (15) of the tenon and is oriented

transversely in the direction of the base of this
recess, so as to form a retaining "V" with the other

fin.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the bead which is arranged at the end of the

central lamina (20) is formed by at least two
longitudinal ribs (25) which project from opposing

faces of the lamina (20) and are each suitable for
cooperating with one of the superposed ribs (26)

projecting from the corresponding faces of the central
recess (15a) of the tenon (7).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that the lamina (13) is realised by
extrusion at the same time as the capping (9), with

which it forms a monolithic assembly.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that the lamina (20) is independent of
the capping (22) and is joined thereto by engagement,

in a longitudinal groove (24) which is "C" shaped in
section and is arranged underneath the inner face of

this capping, of a small bar (23) which forms a body
with said lamina and is arranged perpendicularly with

respect thereto, on the edge of the lamina that is
opposite the edge which has a bead (14).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that one of the profiles which form,
respectively, the tenon (7) and the central fixing 

lamina (13, 20) is made of synthetic material while the
other is made of metal.
