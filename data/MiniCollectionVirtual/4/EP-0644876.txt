<DESCRIPTION>
 ULTRA WHITE N,N'-ETHYLENE-BIS(TETRABROMOPHTHALIMIDE) AND ITS PRODUCTION IN AQUEOUS ACETIC ACIDBACKGROUNDThe present invention relates generally to fire retardants for use in polymer compositions and the like. More particularly, the present invention relates to an ultra-white N,N'-ethylene-bis-(tetrabromophthalimide) composition and to a method for its production.Fire retardant compositions are performance chemicals that must meet exacting standards to gain acceptance and widespread use in industry. Among requirements for flame retardants, color is of particular importance. For a majority of applications, it is desired that the flame retardant be as white as possible. This enables production of high quality white plastics, but is also important because polymer processors require that colors of end products result from the particular pigment utilized rather than its combination with th-e color of the flame retardant.Another important characteristic of flame retardants is purity, for example as can be shown by thermogravimetric analysis. Flame retardant materials that have significant impurities which decompose, volatilize or sublime at polymer processing temperatures can cause undesired color, blowing and other problems in batches into which they are incorporated. Therefore, improved flame retardant materials will also demonstrate stability to higher temperatures in thermogravimetric analysis.One material receiving substantial attention as a flame retardant is N,N'-ethylene-bis-(tetrabromophthalimide) (EBT). However, acceptance of EBT compositions in industry has severely lagged largely because EBT compositions thus far available have been too yellow. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a uniquely white EBT composition for use as a flame retardant, Another object of the invention is to provide a method for producing a uniquely white EBT composition.Another object of the invention is to provide a polymer composition and articles produced therefrom comprising the uniquely white EBT composition.Still another object of the invention is to provide a white EBT composition of high purity as can be demonstrated for example by thermogravimetric analysis.These and other objects of the invention are achieved by preferred embodiments of the present invention, one of which provides a process for preparing a highly white N,N'-ethylene-bis(tetrabromophthalimide) product. This process comprises reacting ethylene diamine and tetrabromophthalic anhydride in aqueous acetic
