<ABSTRACT>
A ribbon unit and a tape unit are accommodated for 
replacement in a tape cassette. The ribbon unit includes 

an ink ribbon, a ribbon spool around which the ink ribbon 
is wound, a ribbon guide roller, a ribbon holder lid and a 

ribbon holder body. A boss is provided on a cassette case 
body, and a back tension spring is anchored at a recessed 

portion of the boss. When a ribbon unit is mounted in the 
cassette case body, the back tension spring becomes 

flexible by a ribbon spool.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape cassette 
for use with a tape producing apparatus, and more particularly, 
to a tape cassette for exclusively printing on a 
tape-like printing medium (hereinafter referred to simply 
as "a tape") using a tape using an ink ribbon. A tape cassette for use with a tape producing 
apparatus of this type is conventionally constructed such 
that a tape and an ink ribbon having substantially equal 
widths are accommodated in a corresponding relationship in 
a single cassette case, and also the lengths of the tape 
and the ink ribbon are substantially equal to each other. 
After the tape or the ink ribbon is used up, the entire 
cassette case is replaced, and the cassette case after use 
is scrapped. A tape cassette of the type just described 
is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Utility Model 
Publication No. Hei 4-32290. However, there is room for improvement in the 
following points in the conventional tape cassette described 
above. As the amount of use of tapes increases, the 
amount of scrapped cassette cases increases, and consequently, 
effective use of resources is not achieved, and 
cinders and smoke produced upon burning of cassette cases 
damages the environment. If the lengths of the tape and 
the ink ribbon accommodated in a tape cassette are increased 
to a great extent, then the amount of the scrapped 
cassette case per unit length of the tape decreases. 
However, this raises new problems that the size of the 
cassette case must be necessarily increased and that also 
the size of a tape producing apparatus with which the 
cassette case is used must be increased. Further, for a user who wants to use common tapes 
having different printing colors and/or widths, different 
cassette cases must be necessarily prepared. This raises  
 
such problems that a high cost is required and that a 
large space is required for accommodation of cassette 
cases. The present invention has been made to solve the 
problems described above, and it is an object of the 
present invention to provide a tape cassette, wherein the 
printing color and/or the printing width can be selected 
comparatively freely by a user and printing of different 
colors and/or different sizes can be performed on the same 
tape. In order to attain the object described above, 
according to the present invention, a tape cassette for 
use with a tape producing apparatus for exclusively 
printing on a tape using an ink ribbon is constructed such 
that the ink ribbon is formed in a unit, and the ink 
ribbo
