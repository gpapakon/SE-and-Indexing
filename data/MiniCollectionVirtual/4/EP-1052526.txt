<ABSTRACT>
A multi-wavelength etalon suitable for tuning and maintaining the
operating frequency of a laser used in an optical communication system is

disclosed. The communication system has a representative channel wavelength
and a channel spacing. The etalon has a plurality of steps on one of the sides with

a step size that is a fraction of the channel spacing. The nominal thickness of the
etalon is chosen so that a transmission peak occurs at a wavelength substantially

equal to the representative channel wavelength and a next peak occurs at the
wavelength of an adjacent channel. The step size is a fraction of the channel

separation and is substantially optimized so that a peak or trough in the
transmission curve in the region of one step overlaps a steep portion of the

transmission curve for one or more other steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a multi-wavelength etalon for use in
stabilizing the wavelength of a laser light source.In many laser applications it is necessary to accurately tune the
output of the laser light source to a particular wavelength. For fiber optic
communications in particular, accurate tuning of the communication lasers is
necessary to permit adjacent transmission channels to be closely spaced, often at
wavelengths differing by only 0.4 nanometers. For such closely spaced channels,
a laser's wavelength must be tuned to the assigned channel with an accuracy of +/-0.1
nanometers or less. One method of accurate laser tuning uses an etalon having
an appropriate thickness to discriminate between various input wavelengths. For
accurate results, the thickness of the etalon must be controlled very precisely.Fig. 1 is a illustration of a conventional etalon 10. The etalon has two
partially reflective parallel surfaces 12, 14 separated by a distance d and is
comprised of a material with an index of refraction r. When collimated light having
a wavelength λ is passed through the etalon, some of the light is reflected from the
surfaces 12, 14. The multiply reflected light beams interfere, either constructively
or destructively, with each other, and thus alter the overall intensity of the light which
passes through the etalon 10. Maximum transmission occurs when twice the
distance between the reflective surfaces 12, 14 is an integral number of
wavelengths λ in the etalon. In other words, 2d*r/A = x, where x is an integer. The
transmission characteristics of etalon 10 are illustrated in the graphs of Figs. 2a and
2b. As shown, the transmission characteristic is a periodic function of wavelength
and the percentage of reflectivity R of the partially reflective surfaces 12, 14. The
thickness d and refractive index r of the etalon determine the distance between the
peaks around a given wavelength. The reflectivity R determines the percentage of
the light that is reflected by the etalon walls. This defines the amount of light which 
is available for constructive and destructive interference, and thus how narrow or
broad the transmission peaks are.In order for an etalon to be used to tune the frequency of a light
source, the intensity of the transmitted light must be determined. Typically, this is
accomplished through the use of a photodetector 16. The intensity of the output
light as measured by the photodetector 16 is compared to the intensity of a
reference beam and the difference is used to generate an error
