<ABSTRACT>
An edge transition detector for a static access memory 
integrated circuit provides programmable operating 

characteristics. The edge transition detector includes a 
delay line taking a state signal received on a signal line 

as an input and generating a delayed state signal. An 
exclusive-OR gate takes the state signal and the delayed 

state signal as inputs and generating a transition pulse 
signal. An edge transition detector enable line connected 

to the exclusive-OR gate forces the output level of the 
exclusive-OR gate to match a predetermined logic level in 

a power efficient manner. An output buffer taking the 
transition pulse signal as its input and generating an edge 

detection pulse signal may also be modified to fusing, mask 
programming, or bonding to eliminate the edge transition 

detection signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an address transition
detection device suitable for use with a static random
access memory (SRAM).SRAMs hold advantages in speed and power demand over
comparable capacity dynamic random access memories (DRAMs).
Memory cells in SRAMS are based on latches instead of
capacitors as in DRAMs. Capacitors dissipate a charge
(corresponding to a bit of data) over time and thus require
periodic refresh. Refresh requires power. Reading and
writing to a capacitor based memory device requires both
time and power. Thus, SRAMs have been advantageously used
in applications requiring high speed operation (e.g. cache
memory for personal computers), or low power consumption
(e.g. portable computers powered by batteries). In
addition, SRAM integrated circuits are simpler to use than
competing DRAMs because DRAMs require complex circuitry for
clocks and refresh operations. Thus SRAMs have been
favored where the improved performance justifies their
greater expense, or in basic electronic components where
the incremental design cost to handle refresh is
unjustified.To further enhance SRAM operating speed, edge
transition detection circuits have been integrated with the
address decoding circuitry of SRAM devices. Edge
transition detection provides a pulse to internally
synchronized components of an SRAM in response to leading
edge transitions in the state of any of a set of address or
control signals. This can be used for controlling 
precharging and equilibration operations within the SRAM
preparatory to reading or writing of data. However, while
useful for high speed operation, edge transition detection
tends to increase on chip noise and power consumption. In
some applications, users may wish to trade speed for less
noise and lower power consumption. However, rather than
providing two distinct SRAM designs, it would be convenient
to be able to reprogram or reconfigure one SRAM type to
elect or not elect edge transition detection operation.It is an object of the invention to provide a static
random access memory (SRAM) circuit allowing user
selectable operating speed, power consumption or noise
tolerance.EP-A-0419852 discloses an edge transition detection
device comprising means responsive to a change in a
state signal received on a signal line for generating a
transition pulse signal. The edge detection pulse of
this device may be fixed by a control signal at a level
indicating non-occurrence of an edge.EP-A-0558079 discloses an edge transition detection
device comprising generating means
