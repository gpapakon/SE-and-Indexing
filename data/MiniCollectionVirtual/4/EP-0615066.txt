<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multi-cylinder internal
combustion engine ("internal combustion engine" may
hereinafter be called "engine") adapted to be mounted
on an automotive vehicle or the like, and more specifically
to a control system developed by paying attention
especially to idling of an engine which can stop the
supply of air-fuel mixture to some of its cylinders to
perform part cylinder operation in a particular state
of operation.With a view to ensuring stabilization of the
engine speed of an automotive engine during idling or
the like, for example in US 4,506,639 there have been proposed techniques in which
pieces of engine speed information, which are repeatedly
detected, are subjected to smoothing (averaging)
processing, the smoothed engine speed so obtained is
compared with the latest rotary speed information and
the ignition timing is then corrected by data based on 
the difference therebetween. The ignition timing is
advanced when the latest engine speed is lower than the
smoothed value but is retarded conversely when the
latest engine speed is higher than the smoothed value.On the other hand, for example in US 4,576,128 other proposals have also been
made on the technique that in an automotive engine, intake
and exhaust valves of some of its cylinders are
kept closed or injectors for supplying fuel to some of
its cylinders are selectively inactivated at the time
of specific operation featuring a small required output
torque such as under a low load to substantially stop a
part of combustion strokes in the engine and hence to
achieve an improvement in gas mileage, in other words,
on variable displacement engines.The present inventors are not aware of any case
in which the above-described idle stabilization technique
based on correction of the ignition timing is applied
to the variable displacement engine described
above. Even if the conventionally-known idle stabilization
technique is applied simply to a variable displacement
engine, the following problems arise.First, upon switching from part cylinder operation to
full cylinder operation or vice versa at the time of
idling, the engine speed generally varies (or the
engine speed is deliberately changed to obtain an idle 
speed suited for part cylinder operation or full
cylinder operation). At this switching, especially at
the time of such switching that the engine speed varies
upwards (or at the time of such switching that the
engine speed is changed upwards), the ignition timing
is corrected toward a retard side to suppress the increase

<CLAIMS>
A control system for a multi-cylinder internal combustion
engine (E) in which switching between full

cylinder operation with all cylinders in operation
and part cylinder operation with some of the cylinders

kept out of operation is performed at least in
the course of idling and ignition timing is controlled

on the basis of a state of operation of said
internal combustion engine, comprising:


means (151) for calculating basic ignition timing
on the basis of the load on and the engine speed of said

internal combustion engine (E);
means (152) for calculating the difference between
a smoothed engine speed, which has been obtained by

smoothing engine speeds of said internal combustion
engine, and the engine speed of said internal combustion

engine;
means (153) for calculating an ignition timing correction
amount on the basis of the difference and a

predetermined correction gain (Kinj) at least in the course
of the idling;
ignition timing correction control means (154) for
changing the predetermined correction gain (Kinj) upon

switching between the full cylinder
operation and the part cylinder operation so

that the ignition timing correction amount is set
greater at the time of the part cylinder operation

than at the time of the full cylinder operation;
means (155) for calculating a target ignition timing
on the basis of the basic ignition timing and

the ignition timing correction amount; and 
means (156) for driving, at the target ignition
timing, ignition drive means (23,36,241,251) for

the respective cylinders in said internal combustion
engine (E).
A control system according to claim 1, wherein said
ignition timing correction control means (154) is

constructed to change the predetermined correction
gain so that at the time of the part cylinder operation,

an advance-side ignition timing correction
amount is set greater in absolute value than a retard-side

ignition timing correction amount.
A control system according to one of the preceding
claims, wherein said ignition timing correction

control means (154) is constructed to make operation
of said ignition timing correction amount calculation

means (153) substantially ineffective upon switching
between the full cylinder operation and the part

cylinder operation.
A control system according to one of the preceding
claims, wherein an idle speed is set faster in the

part cylinder operation than in the full cylinder
operation.
A control system according to one of the preceding
claims, further comprising means (4) for temporarily

increasing the amount of intake air to the internal
combustion engine (E) upon switching from the full

cylinder operation to the part cylinder operation.
