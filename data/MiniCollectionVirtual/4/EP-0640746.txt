A rotor casing, in particular a casing for turbine engines, comprising a 
clamping band surrounding the outer circumference of the casing, and 

an intermediate layer arranged between the clamping band and the 
casing, characterised in that the intermediate layer is formed as a 

closed damping band (6) surrounding the casing (4) so as to conform 
to the contours thereof, the material of the damping band (6) being 

selected so that there is a high friction co-efficient between the 
damping band and the casing, and the material of the clamping band 

(7) having an elasticity modulus different from the material of the 
casing. 
A rotor casing according to claim 1, characterised in that the material 
of the damping band (6) is a rubber elastomer. 
A rotor casing according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the 
material of the damping band (6) is a fibre composite, in particular a 

glass-fibre reinforced plastics, a carbon-fibre reinforced plastics or a 
synthetic-fibre reinforced plastics. 
A rotor casing according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a single 
layer of the damping band (6) surrounds the casing (4) substantially 

over the entire circumference.  
 
A rotor casing according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 
breadth (b) of the damping band (6) corresponds to the length of the 

casing (4) susceptible to vibration and the breadth (b) of the damping 
band (6) is a fraction of the overall length of the casing (4). 
A rotor casing according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the inner surface of the damping band (6) is 

adapted to the outer contours of the surrounded part of the 
circumference of the casing (4). 
A rotor casing according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the degree of circumferential clamping by the 

clamping band (7) is adjustable by means of a detachable clamping 
device (9). 
A rotor casing according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a plurality of curved band members, detachably 

interconnected at their ends, form an annular clamping band (7). 
A rotor casing according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the material of the
 clamping band (7) is a fibre-reinforced 
plastics. 
A rotor casing according to claim 9, characterised in that the base 
material of the clamping band (7) is an elastomer. 
A rotor casing according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the elasticity modulus of the material of the 

clamping band is different from that of the damping band (6).  
 
A rotor casing according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that its outer surface is ribbed and the damping band 

(6) has corresponding recesses in the region of the ribs (2). 
A rotor casing according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the radial thickness of the clamping band (7) 

increases towards the ends of the clamping band (7). 
A rotor casing according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the clamping and damping bands have openings 

(10). 
A rotor casing according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the damping band (7) [sic - 6]
 is covered with a 
protective film.
