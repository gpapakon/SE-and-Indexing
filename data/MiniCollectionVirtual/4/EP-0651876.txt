<ABSTRACT>
In an optical fiber coil arrangement for use in rotation sensors, for example, axial and/or radial errors can be reduced or substantially eliminated by employing trimming lengths of the first and second ends of the optical fiber used to wind the coil. The first and second ends are spatially separated from one another so as to reduce such errors. The trimming lengths may be in the form of trimming turns. To eliminate axial errors, the first end is formed into a first number of trimming turns and the second end is formed into a second number of trimming turns so that the first and second number of trimming turns are spatially offset from each other in an axial direction. To eliminate radial errors, the first end is formed into a first number of trimming turns and the second end is formed into a second number of trimming turns so that the first and second number of trimming turns are spatially offset from each other in a radial direction. Radial and axial compensation may be combined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fiber optic
coils and, more particularly, to fiber optic coils used
in rotation sensors, as may be
used for an advanced global positioning and inertial
guidance system.Optical rotation sensing devices include ring
laser gyros, fiber optic rotation sensors, and the
like. The fiber optic rotation sensor ordinarily
comprises an interferometer which includes a light
source, a beam splitter, a detector, and a light path
which is mounted on a rotatable platform. Light from
the light source is split by the beam splitter into two
beams which are directed to opposite ends of the
optical path and which then counterpropagate around
that path. As the light beams exit the light path,
they are recombined and the resulting combined light
beam is sensed by a detector. A sensing circuit
connected to the detector determines any phase
difference between the counterpropagating light beams.Assuming that this fiber optic rotation
sensor experiences no rotation, ideally no difference
in phase between the counterpropagating light beams
will be detected. On the other hand, if the sensor
experiences rotation, there will be a phase difference
between the counterpropagating light beams which can be 
detected to indicate the extent and direction of
rotation.In a fiber optic rotation sensor, an optical
fiber is coiled, usually in multiple layers, around a
spool, with each layer containing multiple turns.
Currently, such coils are typically wound as
quadrupoles. In order to form a quadrupole coil, each
half of a continuous optical fiber is first wound onto
respective intermediate spools. The first spool is
then used to wind a first layer of turns in a clockwise
direction around a sensor spool. This first layer is
wound around the sensor spool from the first end to the
second end of the sensor spool. The second spool is
then used to wind a second layer of turns in a
counterclockwise direction around a sensor spool. This
second layer is wound around the sensor spool from the
first end to the second end of the sensor spool. The
fiber on the second spool is then wound back from the
second end to the first end of the sensor spool to form
a third layer. The first spool is then used to wind a
fourth layer of turns from the second end of the spool
to the first end. Thus, a portion of one half (i.e.
one end) of the optical fiber is used to form the first
and fourth layers of turns and a portion of the other
half (i.e. the other end) is used to form the second
and third layers. These four layers of turns are
usu
