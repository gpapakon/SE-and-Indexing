<ABSTRACT>
An adapter (70) is provided for enabling the use of night vision goggles (50) having a plug-type mounting connector (58) and a spring biased latch (62), with a head mounting assembly having a plate-type receiving carriage (28). The adapter (70) comprises a housing having a plug-type receptacle which is configured to receive the plug-type mounting connector (58) and a bar capable of engaging the latch (62). The adapter (70) also comprises a mounting plate which is integrally formed to the housing and configured to engage the plate-type receiving carriage (28). The plug-type mounting connector (58) is secured within the plug-type receptacle by an engagement between the latch (62) and the bar. The plug-type mounting connector (58) is capable of selective disengagement from the plug-type receptacle by manual manipulation of the latch (62).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to night vision
systems and, more particularly, to their mounting on
head mounting assemblies such as helmets or face masks.Night vision systems are commonly used by military
and law enforcement personnel for conducting operations
in low light or night conditions. These systems
intensify the ambient light to produce an output image
which is visible to the human eye. A night vision
system of this kind either takes the form of a
binocular, having a separate eye piece for each eye, or
a monocular, having only a single eye piece.It is common for operators of night vision systems
to desire hands free operation, in which the binocular
or monocular systems can be mounted to either a face
mask worn on the operator's face, or to the operator's
helmet. A typical face mask mounting assembly
comprises a rod which is held to the operator's face by
use of a strap which wraps around the head and connects
to the rod on two or more places. At the centre of the
forehead portion of the rod, a mount is provided for
engaging the binocular or monocular. Helmet mounting
assemblies are also available, in which the bar mounts
directly to the operator's helmet. A helmet mounting
assembly of this kind is disclosed in US-A-5331459.
The components comprising a face mask or helmet
mounting system are referred to collectively as
headgear.Currently, the night vision system art is
dominated by two distinct goggle configurations. The
first configuration is designated as the AN/PVS-7A by
the United States government and is manufactured by
Litton Systems, Inc. For further details of Litton
night vision systems the reader is referred to 
US-A-5272514 and US-A-5331459. The second
configuration is designated as the AN/PVS-7B and is
manufactured by VARO, Inc. Both the AN/PVS-7A and the
AN/PVS-7B utilize a binocular format, having two eye
pieces which combine to a single scope. The AN/PVS-7A
night vision system is shown in Fig. 1 and the
AN/PVS-7B night vision system is shown in Fig. 2. Many
of the design features, capabilities and operational
characteristics of the two goggle configurations are
similar.The primary distinction between the two
configurations lies in the method of attachment of the
goggle to the headgear. In the AN/PVS-7A system, a
dovetail shaped plate is configured to secure within a
moveable carriage which mounts to the helmet or face
mask secured bar. The plate locks within the carriage
by use of a releasable locking mechanism within the
carriage, which can be released by manual operation of
a
