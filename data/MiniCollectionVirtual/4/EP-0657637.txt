<ABSTRACT>
System for calculating mixture strength in which 
an electronic panel (7) is capable of comparing the voltage 

generated by exhaust gas sensors, in particular from 
a lambda probe (19) located in the exhaust manifold (21) 

of a petrol engine (4), with a threshold value (Str) such 
as to distinguish between a first and a second state 

(rich state/lean state), corresponding to an air/petrol 
mixture supplied to the engine which contains more or 

less petrol, respectively, than is required by the 
stoichiometric ratio. The system enables this threshold 

to be updated periodically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic
system for calculating mixture strength.Electronic systems are known for calculating
mixture strength in which an electronic panel with a
microprocessor receives as input a series of information
signals measured in the engine (for example, signals
proportional to the quantity of fuel supplied to the
engine, to the temperature of the air drawn into the
engine, to the temperature of the water in the engine
cooling system, etc.), and processes these signals to
generate in open loop a control time T for the injection
device.This time T is corrected by means of a reaction
signal from exhaust gas sensors, in particular a lambda
probe located in the engine's exhaust manifold, the
function of which is to monitor the strength of the air/petrol
mixture supplied to the engine.The signal generated by the lambda probe is substantially
digital in nature and therefore assumes two
different states (high/low) corresponding to an air/petrol
mixture supplied to the engine that contains
respectively more or less petrol than is required by the
stoichiometric ratio (rich mixture/lean mixture).Electronic systems of the known type compare the
voltage generated by the lambda probe with a lower and an
upper reference threshold in order to determine the
status of the probe and therefore the strength (rich or
lean) of the mixture supplied to the engine.However, these systems are extremely complicated
and costly.The thresholds used in the known systems, moreover,
are fixed voltages independent of the amplitude of
the signal generated by the lambda probe; for these
reasons, any fluctuations in the amplitude of the signal
generated by the lambda probe may give rise to errors.The purpose of this invention is to create a
system that will overcome the drawbacks of the known
systems and utilize a dynamic type of threshold.This purpose is achieved by the present invention 
in that it relates to a system as described in Claim 1.The invention will now be illustrated with
particular reference to the attached figures which
present a preferred, non-limiting embodiment and in
which:

internal-combustion engine equipped with an electronic
system for calculating the mixture strength produced
