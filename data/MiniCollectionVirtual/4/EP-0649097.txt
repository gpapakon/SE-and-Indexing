<ABSTRACT>
An interface between unsynchronised devices such as ASICs. The interface 
comprises a delay means which synchronises the write strobe of the first device 

with the system clock of the second device, thus enabling the transfer of data from 
the first device to the second device. The interface requires fewer gates per 

register in the second device than prior art interfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an interface between unsynchronised devices.The invention is particularly relevant to the interface between Application Specific
Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and/or processors, which operate on unsynchronised
system Clocks.In order for a device such as a processor or second ASIC to change the register
contents of a sending device such an ASIC comprising, for example a plurality of
flip-flops, requires data to be presented to the second ASIC along with an address
and a write strobe (WS). The second ASIC is, for the context of this document,
considered to be clocked by a signal referred to as the ASIC Clock signal, to which
the transferred data must ultimately become synchronised.The address, write strobe (WS) and data signals are all synchronous to the sending
device.An address decode circuit on the ASIC will decode the incoming address, to
generate register selects for every register.The write strobe (WS) is used to latch the incoming data into a preliminary register,
synchronous to the sending device, but physically existing on the ASIC (receiving
device). The data in this register must then be transferred to a secondary register,
clocked by the ASICClock signal.A common problem with unsynchronised transfers is that when the data input to
a flip-flop or latch changes at the same time as the clock or enable, the output can
attain a condition referred to as metastability, which is an unpredictable, unstable
state.Therefore, when data is written into a register care must be taken to write the data 
when the ASICClock signal of the register is in an active state when data can be
accurately and unambiguously written into the register. That is data should not be
written into the register when the clock pulse is on its active transaction, i.e. either
rising or falling depending on the device as this will lead to uncertainty as to whether or
not the information will be stored correctly in the register. This is a problem particularly
when data is being transferred between a first ASIC device and a second ASIC device
which operate on different clocks.According to the prior art, as illustrated in Figure 1, the solution to the problem of
metastability is to use three banks of flips flops 1,2,3, the first bank 1 being clocked by
the sending device clock (the write strobe 4 in this instance), and the second and third
banks 2 and 3 being clocked by the receiving clock (ASICClock). In this fashion
although the data from the second bank 2 may be metastable, it will almost certainly
be

<CLAIMS>
An interface between a first device and a second device said devices operating
on independent clock signals, the first device producing a circuit select signal and a

write strobe signal, which triggers the transfer of data from the first device to the
second device, the interface comprising:


a register (6) which stores the data from the first device prior to transfer to the
second device;
a first one-bit register (R1) responsive to a transition in the write strobe signal
and a change of state in the circuit select signal so as to produce an output signal;
a second one-bit register (R2) responsive to the output of the first one-bit
register and a transition in the clock signal of the second device so as to produce an output

signal;
a third one-bit register (R3) responsive to the output of the second one-bit
register and a transition in the clock signal of the second device so as to produce an output

signal; and
a logic element (11) having as inputs the output signals of the second and third
one-bit registers and providing an output signal, synchronous to the clock signal

of the second device, which acts as an enable signal, enabling the transfer of
data from the first device to the second device.
An interface as claimed in claim 1, wherein the logic element is an exclusive-OR
(XOR) gate.
An interface as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein the interface
produces an enable signal for a specific register in the second device

synchronized with the clock signal of the second device only when the 
corresponding circuit select signal for the specific register in the second device

is produced by the first device.
An apparatus comprising a first device, and a second device coupled via an
interface as claimed in any preceding claim.
A method for transferring data between a first device and a second device, said
devices operating on independent clocks, the first device producing a write

strobe signal synchronous with its clock signal, which triggers the transfer of
data from the first device to the second device, comprising the steps of:


changing the state of a first one-bit register in response to a transition of said
write strobe signal;
changing the state of a second one-bit register in response to the changing of
the state of said first one-bit register and a transition of a clock signal from said

second device;
changing the state of a third one-bit register in response to the changing of the
state of the second one-bit register and a transition of the clock signal from said

second device; and
providing an enable signal from a logic element, responsive to the changes of
state of said second and third one-bit registers, for enabling said second device

to accept data transferred from said first device.
A method as claimed in claim 5 wherein the logic element is an exclusive-OR
(XOR) gate.
