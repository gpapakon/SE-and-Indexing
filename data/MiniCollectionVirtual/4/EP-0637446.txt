<ABSTRACT>
Dental floss provided with chemotherapy agents, including wax 
that is emulsible upon contact with saliva. State of the art 

dental flosses achieve an efficient release of active agents 
within the oral environment, by using soluble waxes, but said 

solution decreases comfort of application since there is a decrease 
in the levels of sliding and penetration between the 

teeth, in comparison to the use of insoluble waxes. The use of 
said emulsible wax allows for an efficient release of the 

chemotherapy agent through the oral environment - preferably 
fluoride ions - while maintaining the same levels of sliding 

and penetration between teeth as are obtained with insoluble 
wax.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dental waxed textile materials
(threads and tapes) that contain chemotherapy agents.In order to facilitate understanding of this specification,
any reference to dental floss should be understood
to extend to dental tape, dental thread or any similar materials.Various patent documents that illustrate the state
of the art relating to this invention are mentioned below:US Patent 4,548,219 and US Patent 4,638,823 disclose
a dental floss containing a stannous fluoride incorporated in
the floss by means of a soluble polyethylene glycol wax.Patent application WO9108716 describes a dental
floss in the absence of bonding agents and including a
surfactant, a specific silicone type coating and a
chemotherapy agent.Patent application EP 335466 discloses a low friction
coefficient polytetrafluoroethylene dental floss containing
active agents.US Patent 3838702 discloses a dental floss provided
with a coating of polymer, elastomer, natural or synthetic
wax, which contains inorganic particles that act as a polishing
agent for the teeth.US Patent 4029113 mentions a dental floss (and its
manufacturing process) provided with natural or synthetic wax 
that releases fluorine ion during use. Its manufacturing process comprises passing an
elongated unwaxed dental textile material through an aqueous emulsion of wax
containing the fluorine-containing compound.US Patent 5040554 mentions a dental floss with a wax, soap or detergent
bonding agent, as a base for a phenol derivative germicide coating.US Patent 2667443 relates to dental floss impregnated with chemicals for the
purpose of increasing the resistance of teeth to dental caries. The dental floss can
contain a basic compound with or without a binder such as beeswax, a petroleum wax, a
resin, resinous wax-like material, or a water soluble wax-like material (e.g. solid
ethylene glycol polymer or derivatives).US Patent 2772205 relates to a dental floss containing a higher aliphatic acyl
amide of an amino carboxylic acid compound to inhibit acid production in the mouth
for a prolonged period of time. To render the floss smooth a wax-like material such as
beeswax, paraffin, petroleum wax, solid polyethylene glycols, wax-like resins and
polymers, microcrystalline waxes can be applied to the floss.JP Patent application 12-62857 discloses a dental floss containing a defined
inorganic calcium particulate material and a specified wax.US Patent 3943949 discloses stabilised, flavoured dental floss comprising
filaments with a wax coating containing spray dried
