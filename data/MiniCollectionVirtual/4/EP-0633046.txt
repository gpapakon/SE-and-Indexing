<ABSTRACT>
The body (2) of the toy (1) includes an effect generator (3) controlled by an electric circuit (4) having a counter of pulses received from a mechanical generator of electric pulses (5). The latter comprises a conducting movable body (7) moving in a chamber (8) having two switch terminals (10, 11) which are insulated from each other and such that the movements of the toy (1) can temporarily place the body (7) in simultaneous contact with the two terminals (10, 11) in order to generate a pulse. After counting a number n of pulses, the circuit (4) triggers the effect generator (3), whose operation it interrupts after counting a number m of pulses. Application to the equipping of toys representing living beings, such as dolls or fluffy animals.
