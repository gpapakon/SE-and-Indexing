<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layered plastic pipe particularly suitable for 
use as an intake manifold of an internal combustion engine 

is provided. The present pipe includes a hollow plastic 
core, at least one spacer member provided on the hollow 

plastic core and an outer layer integrally provided on the 
outer peripheral surface of the hollow plastic core 

excepting the spacer member. The spacer member is 
preferably formed from a plastic material, and the outer 

layer is also formed from a plastic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a multi-layer 
plastic pipe, and, in particular, to such a plastic pipe as 
a duct for use as an automobile component like an intake 
manifold. Since the advent of a method for manufacturing a 
plastic pipe whose center axis varies two-dimensionally or 
three-dimensionally in an arbitrary manner by blow molding, 
many of the pipes or ducts used in automobiles have been and 
still are being replaced with plastic pipes and ducts. By 
providing such plastic pipes having a two-dimensional or 
three-dimensional arbitrary shape, for example, when ducts 
or pipes are to be disposed in a limited space of an 
automobile, such as an engine room, without the necessity to 
assemble a plurality of pipe components having simpler 
shapes, a plastic pipe of a unitary structure having a 
complicatedly bent shape, either two-dimensionally Or three-dimensionally, 
can be provided, which contributes to 
facilitate an mounting operation of ducts or pipes. In 
addition, with such a plastic pipe of a unitary structure, 
since there is no connection between pipe components, there 
is no possibility of occurrence of leaks of a fluid passing  
 
through the ducts or pipes. For this reason, many of the 
conventional ducts or pipes made of rubber or the like for 
use in an engine room of an automobile have been and are 
being replaced by plastic pipes. However, for example, even for duct and pipes for use 
in an engine room of an automobile, the required conditions 
may vary radically depending on the conditions in which they 
are used. In particular, since such a duct or pipe as an 
intake manifold is directly mounted on an engine, it is 
exposed to a significantly high temperature, and, moreover, 
since a vibration is directly applied thereto, a high degree 
of durability is required. For such a reason, the 
conventional intake manifold of an automobile was normally 
fabricated from a metal, such as aluminum. However, when a 
duct or pipe is to be manufactured from a metal, its 
manufacturing operation is complicated, difficult and 
expensive, and, moreover, the shape of a duct or pipe to be 
manufactured tends to be limited. Therefore, a considerable effort and a sizable amount 
of money have been expended to try to replace such a duct or 
pipe as an intake manifold with a plastic duct or pipe; 
however, since it is a kind of duct or pipe which requires a 
high degree of heat-resistant characteristic as well as an 
increased durability, there has not yet been proposed any 
such plastic pipe
