<ABSTRACT>
A device for introducing a pig into, and discharging it from, a piggable line is characterised by a housing (1) which can be flanged on to the piggable line, exhibits a rectilinear through-passage duct (2) and in which there is mounted, in a sealing manner, a ball (3) which exhibits a blind bore (5), adapted in cross-section to the cross-section of the pig (6), and which can rotate through 180@ about an axis, lying perpendicularly with respect to the axis of the through-passage duct (2), such that the open end of the blind bore (5) in the end positions of the ball (3) is located opposite either one or the other opening (2.1; 2.2) of the through-passage duct (2).
