<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS OF TREATING PSORIASIS EMPLOYING SUBSTITUTED AZASPIRANESThis invention relates to a method of treatment of psoriasis in a mammal in need thereof which comprises administering to such mammal an effective amount of a substituted azaspirane.Background of the Invention Badger et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,963,557 (Badger I) discloses compounds of the formula(I)wherein: n is 3-7; m is 1 or 2; R* and R^ are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen or straight or branched chain alkyl, provided that the total number of carbon atoms contained by R* and R^ when taken together is 5-10; or R* and R2 together form a cyclic alkyl group having 3-7 carbon atoms; R^ and R^ are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen or straight chain alkyl having 1- 3 carbon atoms; or R^ and R^ are joined together with the nitrogen atom to form a heterocyclic group having 5-8 atoms; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate or solvate thereof.Badger I does not disclose or claim the compounds of Formula I for the treatment of psoriasis. 

 Summary of the Invention This invention relates to a method of treatment of psoriasis in a mammal in need thereof which comprises administering to such mammal an effective amount of a compound of the formula
 (I)wherein: n is 3-7; m is 1 or 2;R! and R^ are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen or straight or branched chain alkyl, provided that the total number of carbon atoms contained by R* and R^ when taken together is 5-10; or R1 and R^ together form a cyclic alkyl group having 3-7 carbon atoms;R3 and R are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen or straight chain alkyl having 1-3 carbon atoms; or R^ and R^ are joined together with the nitrogen atom to form a heterocyclic group having 5-8 atoms; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate or solvate thereof.Detailed Description of the Invention The term "treatment" as used in the specification and in the claims is meant that a mammal in need of antipsoriatic activity is cured of or provided with acceptable symtomatic relief from the disease.The term "effective amount" as used herein is meant the amount needed to effect treatment as defiend above.The term "mammal" as used herein is meant warmed-blooded vertebrate animals, including all that possess hair and suckle their young. Preferably, said mammal is a human.The preparation of all compounds of Formula (I) (active ingredient) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates and solvates and formulations thereof 

is discolsed in
