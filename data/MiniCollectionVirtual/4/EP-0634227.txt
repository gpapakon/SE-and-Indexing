<ABSTRACT>
A broadband ultrasonic transducer has a layer of 
piezoelectric material (4) sandwiched between respective 

layers of backing (10) and matching material (12). The piezoelectric 
element (4) is coupled to a pair of electrical 

terminals (6,8) , across which a varying voltage is produced. 
The piezoelectric layer (4) has a structure such that in 

response to the varying voltage, a forward-propagating 
wave emanating from its back surface (18) does not destructively 

interfere with a forward-propagating wave 
emanating from its front surface (20) when the frequency of 

the waves is an even multiple of the half-wave frequency 
of the particular piezoelectric layer (4). This effect can 

be attained by roughening the back surface (18) of the piezoelectric 
layer (4) or by spatially varying the piezoelectric 

coupling in the thickness direction in a portion of the 
piezoelectric layer (4) which is proximate to the back 

surface (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to ultrasonic
transducers comprising piezoelectric elements sandwiched
between backing/matching layers.Conventional ultrasonic transducers for medical
applications are constructed from one or more piezoelectric
elements sandwiched between a pair of backing/matching
layers. Such piezoelectric elements are constructed
in the shape of plates or rectangular beams
bonded to the backing and matching layers. The piezoelectric
material is typically lead zirconate titanate
(PZT), polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), or PZT ceramic/polymer
composite.Almost all conventional transducers use some variation
of the geometry shown in FIG. 1. The basic ultrasonic
transducer 2 consists of layers of materials, at
least one of which is a piezoelectric plate 4 coupled
to a pair of electric terminals 6 and 8. The electric
terminals are connected to an electrical source having
an impedance Z s. When a voltage waveform v(t) is developed
across the terminals, the material of the piezoelectric
element compresses at a frequency corresponding
to that of the applied voltage, thereby emitting an
ultrasonic wave into the media to which the piezoelectric
element is coupled. Conversely, when an ultrasonic 
wave impinges on the material of the piezoelectric
element, the latter produces a corresponding voltage
across its terminals and the associated electrical load
component of the electrical source.Typically, the front surface of piezoelectric element
4 is covered with one or more acoustic matching
layers or windows (e.g., 12 and 14) that improve the
coupling with the media 16 in which the emitted ultrasonic
waves will propagate. In addition, a backing
layer 10 is coupled to the rear surface of piezoelectric
element 4 to absorb ultrasonic waves that emerge from
the back side of the element so that they will not be
partially reflected and interfere with the ultrasonic
waves propagating in the forward direction. A number of
such ultrasonic transducer constructions are disclosed
in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,217,684, 4,425,525, 4,441,503,
4,470,305 and 4,569,231, all of which are commonly
assigned to the instant assignee.The basic principle of operation of such conventional
transducers is that the piezoelectric element
radiates respective ultrasonic waves of identical shape
but reverse polarity from its back surface 18 and front
surface 20. These waves are indicated in FIG. 1 by the
functions Pb(t) and Pf(t) for the back and front
surfaces respectively. A transducer is said to be half-wave
resonant when the two waves
