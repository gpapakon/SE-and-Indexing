<ABSTRACT>
A motor vehicle seat recliner includes an upper member (34) which is supportive of a seat back (22) and a lower member (36) which is supportive of a seat cushion (21) and is carried for longitudinal adjustment within a host vehicle. An adjuster (40) is operative to establish a substantially fixed angular position between the members, the adjuster including a longitudinally disposed drive screw (62) which is restrained from axial displacement in one direction by an abutment surface (56) which is defined by a thrust plate (46) carried by the lower member and a link (130) which is pivotally interconnected to the screw by a traveling member (126) and is also pivotally interconnected to the upper member by a parallel arrangement of a link control bracket (144) and a displaceable lock plate (154), whereby frontal impact imposed moment arm forces will subject the link and screw to substantially pure compressive loading.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automotive vehicle seat systems
and, more particularly, to lightweight, high strength,
economical frames employed in such systems (see for example
US-A-2 720 914, on which the pre-characterising portions of claims
1 and 16 are based.)The present invention relates to the inventions of U.S. Serial
No. 07/808,503 filed December 17, 1991 entitled "Extruded Automotive
Seat Track", as well as an application entitled "High
Strength Motor Vehicle Seat Recliner", attorney docket number
Rees 4, filed concurrently herewith, the latter corresponding to
EP-A-0 627 996.Automotive seating systems are typically designed as part of a
host vehicle occupant's protection or safety system. Accordingly,
various requirements are imposed on such seating systems.
The must have high strength and structural integrity so that
the seat remains anchored to the vehicle in the event of a
crash, i.e., the seat tracks should not separate from the vehicle,
from each other or from the seat. Furthermore, the seat 
back should either remain in its pre-crash set position, or
under certain conditions collapse in a predictable, energy
absorbing manner. Test results embodied in U.S.
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 208 and 210 require that
the seat belts and their anchorages withstand loads of 1500 to
3000 pounds (approx, 680 to 1360 kg) without failure. If any anchorange is mounted to
the seat structure, the structure must withstand such loads als
well. The outboard (adjacent the door) upper and lower seat
belts and anchorages should withstand the load of 1500 pounds (approx, 680 kg)
and the inboard (adjacent the center line) lower part should
withstand 3000 pounds (approx, 1360 kg). In addition, increased emphasis on fuel
economy necessitates vehicle weight reduction. This, of course,
makes it highly desirable to reduce the weight of the seating
system, but mere weight reduction can adversely impact the
strength of the seating system.Cost containment is still another requirement imposed upon
automotive vehicle seating systems and prior art attempts to
meet all three requirements, high strength - lightweight - low
cost, have not been satisfactory. Some attempts have been made
to substitute aluminium for steel in the design of seat fram
assemblies. These designs typically required steel reinforcements
to provide the necessary structural strength and such
reinforcements add weight, package size and cost to the systems. Another desirable advantage of automotive seating systems is
the integration of the seat
