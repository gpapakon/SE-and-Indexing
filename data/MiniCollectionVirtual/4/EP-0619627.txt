<ABSTRACT>
A lock mechanism for a built-in connector (2) fixed in a casing 
(10) constituting a main body of a diagnostic apparatus, etc., 

to an external plug (3) connected to a cable of a measurement sensor, 
etc. The built-in connector (2) is fixed inside an open portion 

of a panel (11) of the casing (10) of the apparatus, and shutters (4; 
6; 7) for closing the open portion (13) are disposed in front of the 

fixed connector (2) in such a fashion as to define an opening (12) 
for receiving the plug (3) between the front portion of the connector 

and the shutters (4; 6; 7). The plug is locked when its rear portion 
is engaged with cuts (41, 61, 71) formed at forward edges of 

the shutters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lock mechanism 
for a connector which links a connector built into a 
casing with a plug connected to a cord. Some diagnostic devices used in medicine have 
various types of diagnostic sensors which are separate 
from the main body of the measurement unit and are 
connected to it by a cord. In devices used on a 
relatively frequent basis for diagnostic applications, 
there is a built-in connector on the front of the 
operating panel of the main body of the device, or on a 
panel surface which is conveniently located for operating 
measurement devices such as sensors. A plug which fits 
into this connector is attached to the cord or cable 
containing an electric wire which sends electrical 
signals from the sensor to the main body of the unit, and 
the cord is disconnected by pulling the plug out of the 
connector. This type of plug on the cord side and built-in 
connector on the device side make the sensor 
interchangeable, facilitate repair tests, and make  
 
exchanging and proper use of sensors easy. In cord 
connections in conventional sensors, to cite an example, 
after the plug on the cord side is inserted into the 
built-in connector on the main body of the unit, a nut 
installed on the cord side connector in such a manner 
that it can be rotated is screwed onto a threaded portion 
on the outer periphery of the built-in connector in order 
to prevent the plug from being pulled out. The above connector for diagnostic devices, etc., 
uses a nut-type fixing mechanism in order to prevent the 
plug from being pulled out, thus providing a solid 
electrical connection, but its drawback is that when the 
connector is pulled out, it is necessary to rotate the 
nut-type fixing device, making operation inconvenient. Moreover, in cases where a sensor is not being used, 
the connector on the device side is exposed on the 
surface of the panel, which may lead to the accumulation 
and adhesion of dust on the connector, and in an 
environment in which substances such as water and drugs 
are used, there is a risk that liquid may adhere to the 
connector. For this reason, a plastic cap is placed on 
the connector, or a cap nut is screwed on in order to 
cover it when the connector is not in use. However, 
these operations are frequently forgotten, and when the 
connector is used for measurement without removing 
liquids which have adhered to it, errors may occur in  
 
measurement values, or measurement may become impossible 
due to poor conduction. In recent years, in order to

<CLAIMS>
A locking mechanism for a built-in connector, said 
connector being fixed inside an open portion of a 

panel (12) in a casing, said connector being a type 
of connector which engages a plug (31) connected to 

an electrical cord, said locking mechanism 
comprising a shutter for closing an open portion of 

a panel 

at least one flat shutter (7) for closing said open 
portion of said panel (12), said shutter being 

arranged in a front portion of said built-in 
connector, an opening being formed for receiving 

said plug between said front portion of said 
connector and said shutter; and 
at least one notch (71) formed in said shutter, 
characterised in that said shutter is rotatable 

about an axle (72), and said notch being located on 
said shutter to engage a rear portion of said plug 

to lock said plug into said connector. 
The locking mechanism of Claim 1 further 
characterised by: 


a knob (73); and 
a curved slot (16) in said panel, said knob being 
positioned to move in said curved slot to contact 

said shutter and rotate said shutter about said 
axle. 
A locking mechanism for a built-in connector, said 
connector being fixed inside an open portion of a 

panel (12) in a casing, said connector being a type 
of connector which engages a plug (31) connected to 

an electrical cord, said locking mechanism 
comprising a shutter for closing an open portion of 

a panel, wherein said locking mechanism comprising: 

a curved shutter (4) for closing said open portion 
of said panel, said shutter being arranged in 

a front portion of said built-in connector, an 
opening being formed for receiving said plug 

between said front portion of said connector 
and said shutter; 
at least one notch (41) formed in said shutter, 
wherein a rear portion of said plug is engaged in 

said notch formed in said shutter so that said plug 
is locked into said connector; and characterised by: 
a pair of parallel components (42) attached to said 
shutter and supported inside said panel by an axle (52), 

such that said shutter is capable of rotating about 
said axle to retract into said open portion of said 

panel; 
said shutter forming an arc such that the entire arc 
is on the same side of said axle as said open 

portion of said panel, such that said shutter will 
close under its own weight. 
The locking mechanism of Claim 3 further comprising 
a user-movable knob consisting of an arc-shaped 

protrusion of said parallel components beyond said 
shutter. 
The locking mechanism of Claim 4 further comprising 
a series of horizontal ridges on said protrusions to 

facilitate user grasping. 
A built-in connector provided with a locking 
mechanism according to any of Claims 1 to 5.
