<ABSTRACT>
A shelf-stable, uncooked or partially cooked moist pasta is 
produced by treating freshly extruded or sheeted pasta with steam 

to set the pasta surface, immersing the steam treated pasta in an 
aqueous solution containing acidulants and/or humectants, 

partially drying to remove surface moisture, sealing the pasta in 
a container, and thermally pasteurizing the pasta while it is in 

the container using conventional thermal processes or microwave 
treatment. The pasta thus produced is shelf-stable under nonrefrigerated 

conditions and has an equivalent or better texture, 
color and flavor than commercially available, fresh refrigerated 

pastas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to shelf-stable moist pasta.
More particularly, the invention has to do with uncooked and
partially cooked pasta which is moist and shelf-stable and
methods of manufacturing and packaging the pasta.There is a consumer demand for moist pasta products which
are fresh tasting and have good microbiological quality. Shelf-stable
moist pastas are particularly attractive to the retailer
and consumer because they do not require refrigeration.Uncooked and partially cooked moist pastas, which generally
are defined as moist pastas which are not fully cooked, are
flexible and have a moisture content between about 15 and 38
percent, have been described in U.S. Patents No. 4,529,609 and
4,540,590. Both patents describe combinations of formulation,
steaming and (only in U.S. 4,540,590) thermal pasteurization to produce shelf-stable,
uncooked moist pasta. The disadvantage of the approach
disclosed, however, is that they require the direct addition of
salt and acids into the dough mix. This impairs pasta quality,
particularly pasta texture and appearance.Another type of moist pasta is pre-cooked moist pasta, which
generally is defined as moist pasta that is fully-cooked and has 
more than thirty-eight percent moisture preferably between sixty
and seventy-five percent moisture.The pre-cooked moist pastas have been prepared by the
combination of formulation treatment, either by direct addition
of acid and/or salt, or immersion in acid and/or salt solution,
steaming and thermal pasteurization to achieve shelf-stability.
These approaches are disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 4,597,976;
4,599,238 and 4,734,291. The major drawback of these pre-cooked
moist pastas is that they have a soggy/mushy texture because the
moisture difference between the core and surface portion of the
cooked pasta is lost. Freshly cooked pasta has a core that was
just cooked and its moisture content is relatively limited
compared with the surface portion. This moisture difference is
responsible for the "al dente" texture. However, as fully cooked
pasta is allowed to stand after cooking, the moisture difference
between the core and the surface of the pasta disappears and the
"al dente" texture is lost. The pasta becomes soggy and mushy,
which is the case for most pre-cooked pasta.U.S. Patent No. 4,789,553 discloses a method of reducing
thermal processing requirements for retorting pre-cooked low acid
foods by using aldonic acid and its lactone. The aldonic acid
and its lactone are said to reduce thermal requirements for
commer

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a shelf-stable, moist pasta product, which is not fully cooked
comprising the sequential steps of:


a) preparing a fresh pasta;
b) subjecting the fresh pasta to steam treatment to set the
pasta surface;
c) immersing the steam treated pasta in an acidulant, a
humectant or a mixture of an acidulant and a humectant

for a sufficient time to cause the pH of the pasta to
drop below 4.6 and/or to cause the A
W
 of the pasta to
drop below 0.85;
d) partially drying the pasta to a moisture content of from
15 to 38 percent, following immersing;
e) sealing the partially dried pasta in a container; and
f) pasteurizing the pasta in the container.
The method of claim wherein the acidulant is selected
from the group consisting of citric acid, lactic acid, fumaric

acid, tartaric acid, malic acid and glucono delta lactone.
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the humectant is
selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride,

propylene glycol and glycerol.
The method of any of claims 1 to 3 wherein the acidulant
comprises an aqueous solution of citric acid and lactic acid

and the acids are present in a weight ratio from 40:60 to
60:40 and the solution has a pH from 1.5 to 3.5.
The method of any of claims 1 to 4 wherein the humectant
is an aqueous solution of sodium chloride which comprises from

10 to 20 percent sodium chloride by weight. 
The method of any of claims 1 to 5 wherein the partially
dried pasta is sealed in a container under a partial vacuum of

from 45300 Pa (340 mmHg) to 53300 Pa (400 mmHg) before
pasteurizing.
The method of any of claims 1 to 6 wherein the partially
drying is to a moisture content of from 20 to 30 percent.
A pasteurized, shelf-stable, moist pasta product which is not fully cooked packaged

in a sealed container, obtainable by a process as claimed in
any of claims 1 to 7.
