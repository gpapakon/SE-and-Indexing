<ABSTRACT>
A device (1) for pneumatically testing tobacco 
items (2), particularly cigarettes, wherein a conveyor 

(3), with transverse seats (6) for respectively 
receiving at least one item (2), transports, coaxially 

with at least one end of each seat (6), a terminal (12) 
of a compressed test fluid circuit (13) and a connecting 

element (14) for connecting the terminal (12) to a 
respective item (2) inside the respective seat (6); the 

connecting element (14) being a tubular elastic bladder 
element surrounding the terminal (12) and connectable to 

a compressed fluid source (50) so as to selectively 
assume an expanded configuration wherein it is connected 

in fluidtight manner to one end of a respective item 
(2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
pneumatically testing tobacco items, particularly
cigarettes.For the sake of simplicity, in the following
description, specific reference will be made purely by
way of example to the above application of the present
device.Cigarette manufacturing and processing lines, and
particularly filter assembly machines, are fitted with
devices for pneumatically testing the cigarettes to
determine correct assembly and soundness of the various
component parts.In general, known test devices of the above type,
for example the test device disclosed in DE-A-3219100 or
DE-A-3110550, comprise a conveyor - normally a rotary
drum - with a succession of seats, each for receiving
and retaining at least one cigarette; and, coaxially
with each end of each seat, the conveyor carries a
terminal of a compressed test fluid circuit. One of the 
terminals is normally connected to a supply pump, and
the other terminal to a control system which, by
measuring the variations in the test fluid as it flows
through the cigarette, provides for determining
acceptance or rejection of the cigarette.The terminals of known test devices of the above
type are normally connected to respective mechanical
control devices for moving the terminals or parts
thereof axially to and from a position outside an
advancement path of the cigarettes to an operative
position engaging a respective end of a cigarette housed
in a respective seat.In the case of DE-A-3219100, the above control
devices include two discs arranged on opposite sides of
the cigarette drum and rotatable therewith, the above
discs supporting the terminals and being inclined
towards each other so as to define a test station where
the distance between opposite corresponding terminals is
less than the length of the cigarettes to be tested,
whereas such distance is greater than the above length
outside such test station.In the case of DE-A-3110550, each terminal
includes a rigid tubular element defining an external
portion of the terminal, and the above control devices
include, for each terminal, a cam operated spring leaf
for axially displacing the relevant rigid tubular
element, which is connected to the remaining part of the
terminal via a tubular elastic element. In general, in known test devices, depending on
whether the seat contains one or two cigarettes, two or
four of such mechanical devices are provided for each
seat, and are not only cumbersome and expensive to
produce, but also contribute towards increasing the
weight of the conveyor and

<CLAIMS>
A device for pneumatically testing tobacco
items (2), in particular cigarettes; the device

comprising a conveyor (3) with transverse seats (6),
each for receiving at least one item (2); and a circuit

(13) for a compressed test fluid; the circuit (13)
comprising a compressed fluid source (50), a number of

terminals (12) connectable to the source (50) and each
fitted to the conveyor (3) coaxially with a respective

end of a respective seat (6); and, for each terminal
(12), an elastic element (14) for connecting the

terminal (12) to the respective item (2); characterized
in that the elastic element (14) is an elastic bladder

element (14) for receiving compressed fluid; supply
means (40) being connectable to the elastic bladder

element (14) for selectively feeding a compressed fluid
thereto to expand the elastic bladder element (14) from

a first non-interfering configuration, wherein the
elastic bladder element (14) is arranged outside an

advancement path of the respective item (2), into an
interfering configuration wherein the elastic bladder

element (14) interferes with said advancement path and
is connected in fluidtight manner to one end of the

respective item (2) inside a respective said seat (6).
A device as claimed in Claim 1, characterized
in that each elastic bladder element (14) is an elastic

tubular element (14) surrounding the respective terminal 
(12).
A device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized
in that each elastic bladder element (14) comprises a

relatively rigid portion (32) mounted so as to slide
along the respective terminal (12); at least one

elastically deformable portion (33, 34) associated with
said rigid portion (32); and two annular end feet (29,

31) for connecting the elastic bladder element (14) in
fluidtight manner to the respective terminal (12); the

elastic bladder element (14) defining, about the
respective terminal (12), a variable-volume air chamber
