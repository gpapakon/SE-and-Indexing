<ABSTRACT>
An existing gynecologic instrument is capable of rotating the uterus to any 
of its natural positions within the peritoneal cavity which instrument 

lessens the danger of damage to vaginal and uterine tissue and which 
instrument may be adopted for injection of dye into a uterus while the uterus 

is maintained in any of its natural positions. 
In the apparatus of the present invention, the improvements reside in means 
for connecting the tube to the head wherein the tube is fitted or otherwise 

attached to an end of a piston held in place in the head by a pin which is 
capable of moving within a groove within the head in such a manner that does 

not permit removal of the piston from the head as long as the tube is not 
pivoted about the piston beyond a predetermined degree.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gynecologic
instrument useful in gynecologic laparoscopy. More
particularly, the present invention is directed to a
uterine mobilizer or manipulator. Specifically the
present invention is directed to an improved uterine
mobilizer provided with improved connection mechanism
for connecting and disconnecting the head of the
instrument to the tube of the instrument.In my U.S. Patent 4,022,208, the disclosure of which
in its entirety is incorporated by reference herein, I
disclose and claim a gynecologic instrument capable of
rotating the uterus to any of its natural positions
within the peritoneal cavity which instrument lessens the
danger of damage to vaginal and uterine tissue and which
instrument may be adopted for injection of dye into a
uterus while the uterus is maintained in any of its
natural positions.The present invention is directed to an improvement
to be embodied in gynelogic instruments that is
particularly useful when embodied in the gynecologic 
instrument disclosed and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 4,022,208.It is pointed to a laparoscopy cannula according to EP-A 0 400 458. This
laparoscopy cannula comprises a tube having a proximal end a distal end and the
tube holder is fitted in a releasable manner to the proximal end of the tube.US-A-4000743 discloses the features of the preamble
of claim 1, the latter describes a uterine anteverter which
comprises a tube having a proximal end and a distal end and a head pivotally
connected to the distal end of the tube.However, in then instruments according to the prior art the manner how the head
is connected to the tube is not optimal.In the apparatus of the present invention as set out in claim 1, the improvements reside in means for
connected the tube to the head wherein the tube is fitted or otherwise attached to
an end of a piston held in place in the head by a pin which is capable of moving
within a groove within the head in such a manner that does not permit removal of
the piston from the head as long as the tube is not pivoted about the piston
beyond a predetermined degree.Prefered embodiments are specified in the dependent claims.The invention will be clearly understood after reference to the following detailed
specification read in conjunction with the drawings.In the drawings:
Fig. 1is a side view elevational of an apparatus in
accordance with the present invention. Fig. 2is a side view of an apparatus in accordance with the
present invention, and Fig. 2a is a partial side view

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A gynecologic instrument comprising:

a tube (1) having a proximal end and a distal end;
a head (2) for receiving a device, pivotally fitted to the distal end of said
tube (1);
a tube holder (23) fitted in a releasable manner to the proximal end of said
tube (1), and
a control link (5) to fix the angular position of head (2) with respect to
said tube (1),

characterized by

a journal (3) having an end attached to the distal end of said tube
(1), said journal (3) comprising a pin (9) and said head (2)

comprising an opening along a pivotal axis of said head with
respect to said tube for receiving said journal and a groove (9a)

provided in said opening for receiving said pin (9), said journal (3)
being pivotally fitted in said opening and said pin engaging said

groove (9a) to pivotally connect said tube (1) in a pivotally
releasable manner to said head (2) such that said journal (3) can be

released from said head (2) when said tube (1) is rotated about said
journal (3) beyond a predetermined degree. 
The gynecologic instrument of claim 1, wherein said proximal end
of said tube 
comprises a fitting (22).
The gynecologic instrument of claim 2, wherein said tube holder
(23) comprises a means for engaging said fitting (22).
The gynecologic instrument of claim 3, wherein said fitting (22)
comprises a recessed area for receiving said means for engaging. 
The gynecologic instrument of claim 4, wherein said means for
engaging comprises a projection adapted to fit in said recessed area

of said fitting.
The gynecologic instrument of claim 5, wherein said projection is
spring-biased to engage said recessed area.
The gynecologic instrument of claim 1, wherein said groove (9a)
and said pin (9) are adapted to be disengaged by rotating said tube

(1) about said journal (3) by a prescribed degree of rotation.
The gynecologic instrument of claim 1, comprising a passageway
through said tube (1), said journal (3) and said head (2) to permit

the passage of fluid therethrough.
