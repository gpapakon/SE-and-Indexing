<CLAIMS>
A body which is protected from erosion during its use when subjected to an air flow, 
substantially comprising a fibrous material or fibre-reinforced plastic, particularly a 

rotor blade, which body is covered, in each region of its surface which is to be 
protected, by a multilayer, metallic coating which consists of a base layer of light 

metal, preferably aluminium, wherein the light metal has a modulus of elasticity 
which is approximately identical to that of the material on the surface of the body, 


characterised in that
 the base layer in the form of a metal sheet (1) is adhesively 
bonded to the surface of the body and is coated with at least one layer of a two-phase 

material (outer layer 2) in which finely divided particles of metal oxide or/and metal 
carbide or/and metal nitride compounds are embedded in a ductile, solid solution-hardened 

matrix of a nonferrous metal.
