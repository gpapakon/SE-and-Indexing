<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
producing vitamin B₁₂ which has widely been used as agents for 
treating pernicious anemia, nervous diseases, methylmalonic 
aciduria, etc., and feed additives for fowls and/or domestic 
animals. The industrial production of vitamin B₁₂ by chemical 
synthetic methods is difficult because of its complex 
structure. Fermentation processes using microorganisms have 
been used for its production. It is reported that vitamin B₁₂ is produced by 
microorganisms belonging to the genera Streptomyces, 
Norcardia, Micromonospora, Aerobacter, Agrobacterium, 
Alcaligenes, Azotobacter, Bacillus, Clostridium, 
Corynebacterium, Escherichia, Flavobacterium, Mycobacterium, 
Pseudomonas, Propionibacterium, Proteus, Serratia, 
Streptococcus, Xanthomonas, Protaminobacter, Methanobacillus 
(E. J. Vandamme, Biotechnology of Vitamins, Pigments and 
Growth Factors, Elsevier Science Publisher LTD, 1989, 261-263), 
Arthrobacter (JP-A 52-94498), Klebsiella (JP-A 50-132186), 
Rhodopseudomonus (JP-A 60-16597), Butyribacterium 
(JP-A 62-44197), Pseudonocardia (JP-A 55-96091),  Methanosarcina (JP-A 1-257490), Eubacterium (JP-A 62-44172), 
Acetobacterium (JP-A 62-122593), etc. Further, it is reported 
that vitamin B₁₂ is accumulated by microorganisms belonging to 
the genera Rhizobiummeliloti, Rhizobiumphaseoli, Rhizobium 
japonicum, Rhizobiumtrifolli and Rhizobiumleguminosarum 
(Plant Physiology, 38, 99-104 (1963)). Of the above microorganisms belonging to the genus 
Rhizobium, Rhizobiumphaseoli and Rhizobiumtrifolli have been 
renamed Rhizobiumleguminosarum (see Institute for 
Fermentation, Osaka, Japan, List of Cultures 1992 
Microorganisms, 9th edition, p. 169). A part of Rhizobiumjaponicum has been renamed Rhizobiumleguminosarum and the 
rest has been re-classified into Bradyrhizobiumjaponicum (see 
Institute for Fermentation, Osaka, Japan, List of Cultures 
1992 Microorganisms, 9th edition, p. 169). However, in general, microbial processes produce 
vitamin B₁₂ in very low yield. Further, some microorganisms 
can utilize limited carbon sources (methanol assimilating 
bacteria, etc.), need special cultivation conditions such as 
anaerobic conditions (propionibacteria, microorganisms 
belonging to the genus Acetobacterium, methane producing 
bacteria, etc.), need long cultivation because of their low 
growth rates (methane producing bacteria, propionibacteria, 
and therefore can be used for the industrial production  
 
only under limited conditions. Thus, improved industrial 
methods of
