<ABSTRACT>
Patent abstract: the "Summit" snow chain is original in its particular structure and for its variations in colour and in size. Furthermore, it allows rapid and particular familiarity in fitting and removal. Its originality consists in the fact that apart from allowing excellent and reliable stability on ice and on snow, it gives a great deal of safety; this has been demonstrated in all trials carried out on uneven and snow-covered ground.
