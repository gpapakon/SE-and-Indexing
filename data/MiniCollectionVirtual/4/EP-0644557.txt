<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a means of using flexible (also often 
referred to as simply "flex") circuit (17) structures for 

external cabling (11) in a small light package, particularly 
those utilized in portable computers. The external cabling 

is composed of a flex circuit that is strengthened by fiber 
strands (16), and a wrapped sheath (10) of woven mesh 

netting. The cabling may be further encased in an 
overcoating (18) for protection against abrasion and 

chemicals. The packaging scheme using this cable may include 
a storage device for the cable such that the cable is 

retractable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to external cabling and particularly 
that which may be used with portable computers. Flexible external cables for use with portable computers are 
known in the prior art. Examples are shown in U.S. 
4,417,703, 4,075,420, and 4,812,135. Such cables, intended 
for use external to the housing of a particular type of 
electronic device (e.g., a computer) often present unique 
problems not solved by the prior art. Further, flexible flat 
cables used in the field of portable electronics, and 
specifically in the field of portable computers, may present 
additional problems. Flexible flat cables are typically fragile. Such cables lack 
strength due to the relatively small size and flat geometry 
thereof. Generally, external stress relief devices are 
required to strengthen the cable but such stress relief 
members often reduce the flexible properties of the cables. Flat ribbon-like flexible cables that are unprotected may 
suffer breakage in bending. Further, stress on flexible 
cable from pulling the cable may result in tearing and 
disconnecting of any attached connectors. When flexible flat cables are employed outside of the 
protective housing of electronic devices, damage may occur. 
The exposure of the cables to outside forces may result in 
accidental piercing and/or cutting of the cable's internal 
conductive elements. In addition, exposure to industrial 
environment chemicals may result in corrosive damage. The desired light weight and small size of flexible flat 
cables make these ideal for transporting for use with 
portable computing devices such as laptop and notebook class  
 
computers. The trend toward even smaller sub-notebook class 
computers with less functional hardware increases the need 
for connection to external devices. Unfortunately the fragile 
nature of flexible cables inhibit the ability to use them in 
a traveling environment. Some attempts to strengthen flexible cables in the prior art, 
for example U.S. 4,417,703, have included the use of 
laminated fibers to the ribbon cable. Unfortunately, direct 
bonding to the ribbon cable changes the electrical 
characteristics of the cable and, therefore, produces 
undesirable side-effects. The length of the cable may also present a problem for 
travelers. A lengthy cable is often difficult to pack and 
store. Further, if any substantial length of cable is needed 
for a networking or communication application, the cable may 
become entangled and present a potential safety problem. It is often difficult to
