<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a bread box with a bottom (1), side walls (2, 3) and a flap (5) closing a front opening, the flap is able to pivot downwards about a horizontal shaft (6) lying in the plane of the bottom (1) and is designed as a cutting board. In order to trap the crumbs produced during cutting, a crumb-collecting channel (8) is fitted on to the front edge (9) of the bottom (1). The crumb-collecting channel can be withdrawn forwards and then emptied. The channel (8) is open at both ends and its ends are closed off, when the channel is fitted on, by projections (10) of the side walls (2, 3).
