<DESCRIPTION>
 Improved additive composition for oil well cementing formulationsField of the inventionThe present invention relates to a improved oil and gas well cementing composition having a synergistic combination of nonionic and anionic surfactants which in particular improves the fluid loss, free water and rheological properties and provides good compressive strength of the resulting cementing composition. The invention also relates to the use of certain nonionic and anionic surfactants as additives for improving oil and gas well cementing compositions.Background of the inventionThe initial step in the recovery of hydrocarbons and gases from underground formations is the placement of the cement slurry, usually including cement, water and other additives, in the annular space between the porous formation and the steel casing. The main purpose of the cement in this annular space is to support the casing and also restrict fluid movement between formations. This process is referred to as primary cementing. The most important requirements to insure a satisfactory cementing job are that a highly homogenous cement is present in the annulus and that strong bonds develop between the rock formation, cement and steel casing.In order for this to happen, one must insure that the composition of the cement slurry pumped downhole does not change greatly dur¬ ing the whole cementing process. Therefore, contamination of the cement slurry by the drilling mud used in the previous operation or excessive loss of water to the formation must be carefully avoided. A well-formulated cement slurry will, therefore, exhibit low fluid loss to the formation, give either zero or very low free water, have a viscosity low enough to be pumpable, set to a hardened mass within the desired time interval and provide adequate compressive strength to support the casing.The free water of a slurry is simply the supernatant fluid formed on top of the slurry column which provides an indication of the amount of settling of the cement particles during slurry place¬ ment. Excessive free water on top of the cement column will result in an incompetent zone close to the top of the liner which will have to be remedied with an expensive squeeze job. The viscosity of the slurry describes the rheological behavior of the slurry, which is determined by measuring the plastic viscosity 

 (pv) and the yield point (yp) of the slurry. The cement slurry should be fluid and pumpable until it is in place, then it should start to set as soon as possible after placement. Any
