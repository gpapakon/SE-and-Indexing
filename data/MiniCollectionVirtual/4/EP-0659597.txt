<ABSTRACT>
A device for facilitating the mounting and removal of tyres (10) 
onto and from respective wheel rims (11) and intended to be 

associated with tyre removal machines (1) comprising a self-centering 
unit (4) of typically vertical axis (100) and a vertical 

prismatic rear shaft (8) carrying the tool (9) for mounting and 
removing the tyre, comprises an arm (18) articulated about a 

vertical axis (200) and having one end hinged on a vertical axis 
(14) to a structure adjustable in height relative to the base (2) 

of the machine (1), while its other end carries slidingly mounted 
thereon an implement (23; 24) able to maintain facing the channel 

(112) in the wheel rim rim (11) that part of the bead to be 
mounted or removed which lies below the edge of the wheel rim, 

that arm part (180) directly hinged to said height-adjustable 
structure having a length such that the articulation axis (200) of 

the articulated arm (18) can be positioned coaxial to the self-centering 
unit (4), with the implement (23), when in its working 

position, rotating rigidly with this latter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for facilitating the mounting 
and removal of tyres onto and from respective wheel rims, such as 
to prevent damage to the tyre and under conditions of maximum 
safety for the operator. As is well known, modern tyre removal machines, typically for 
automobile and other light vehicle wheels and for motorcycle 
wheels, comprise, inter alia, a usually horizontal self-centering 
unit provided for locking the wheel rims, and an overlying tool 
for mounting and removing the respective tyres, this acting 
between the edge of the wheel rim and the tyre bead. Said tool 
can be adjusted both vertically and horizontally, in order to 
adapt its operating position to wheel rims of different widths and 
diameters. Specifically, said tool is supported by a vertical shaft slidingly 
mounted at the end of a horizontal arm branching from a column 
situated behind the self-centering unit. A problem arising in such tyre removal machines is that of easily, 
rapidly and safely mounting and removing tyres onto and from the 
respective wheel rims. With particular reference to their mounting, to position each bead 
of a tyre below the edge of a wheel rim locked onto the self-centering 
unit, at that moment stationary, the procedure is as  
 
follows. Firstly, the bead is rested on the edge of the wheel rim, then the 
mounting tool is inserted between the rim and the bead, after 
which the bead is inclined in order to position below said tool 
and below said wheel rim edge that bead part which, with reference 
to the direction of rotation of the self-centering unit, lies 
downstream of said tool, and finally the self-centering unit is 
made to rotate, with the result that said mounting tool inserts 
the remaining (upstream) part of the bead below the wheel rim 
edge. However the mere action of the mounting tool can subject 
the bead to difficulties and/or excessive stresses, and hence to 
possible damage such as stretching, local weaknesses and cracking. This is due to the fact that that bead part already inserted rests 
against its final seat without entering the wheel rim channel, 
which is of smaller diameter. For these reasons, when mounting each individual bead the operator 
is required to thrust downwards that bead part gradually arriving 
below the edge of the wheel rim, in order to maintain it within 
the rim channel. Said thrust action is normally exerted by hand, but in certain 
cases a lever has to be used, in particular if the beads are 
fairly rigid and hence particularly difficult

A device for facilitating the mounting and removal of 
tyres (10) onto and from respective wheel rims (11) and intended 

to be associated with tyre removal machines (1) comprising a self-centering 
unit (4) of typically vertical axis (100) and a vertical 

prismatic rear rod (8) carrying a tool (9) for mounting and 
removing the tyre, characterised by an arm (18) 

articulated abort a vertical axis (200) and having one end (180) hinged 
on a vertical axis (14) to a structure adjustable in height 

relative to a base (2) of the machine (1), while its other end 
(181) carries slidingly mounted thereon an implement (23; 24) able to 

maintain facing the channel (112) in the wheel rim (11) that 
bead part (102) of the tyre t
o be mounted or removed which lies below the 
edge of the wheel rim, that one end (180) of the arm directly hinged to said 

height-adjustable structure having a length such that said vertical 
articulation axis (200) of the articulated arm (18) can be 

positioned coaxial to the self-centering unit (4), with the 
implement (23; 24), when in its working position, rotating rigidly 

with this latter. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
height-adjustable structure consists of a vertical telescopic 

structure, such as a double-acting pneumatic cylinder-piston unit, 
which is fixed to said base (2). 
A device as claimed in the preceding claims, characterised 
in that between said height-adjustable structure and the 

respective one end (180) of the articulated arm (18) there is 
interposed a latch (184), with relative release member, arranged 

to engage in a coupling seat (185) which establishes coaxiality 
between said vertical axes (200) and (100). 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
implement (23) consists of a thrust head which is fixed to an 

overlying slider (20) mounted on the other end (181) of said 
articulated arm (18), and comprises a lower shaped portion (230)  

 
arranged to rest against the bead to be mounted, and a lateral 

portion (231) arranged to rest against the edge (110) of the wheel 
rim (11). 
A device as claimed in claims 1 and 4, characterised by 
being provided with a series of interchangeable heads. 
A device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
implement (24) comprises a substantially horizontal bracket 

arranged to support the tyre (10) in order to maintain in front of 
the wheel rim channel the bead to be removed, and consisting of a 

flange of a right-angled body having its dihedron facing upwards, 
its other flange being provided at its rear with a seat for 

removably engaging that other end (181) of the arm (18) which supports 
a thrust head (23) of said implement.
