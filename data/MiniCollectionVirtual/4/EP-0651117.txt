<ABSTRACT>
A key for a lock cylinder (3) containing a rotationally adjustable cylinder plug (4) with a keyway (11) opening out freely in its circumferential surface is provided with a profile region (15) which faces the key spine extending flush with the cylinder-plug circumferential surface in the key-insertion position and which is provided with lateral recesses (for example, 18), and with an indentation region (13) which faces the opposite key breast and can be pushed into the region of the keyway (11) located in the middle of the cylinder plug and which has a round-cylindrical, particularly circular-cylindrical shape and possesses milled depressions, countersinks or suchlike indentations (16), arranged circumferentially and offset in it, for putting in position tumbler elements (8) mounted in the lock cylinder (3) so as to be adjustable radially relative to the plug centre of the latter. In order to give the key even greater stability and an even larger circumferential surface for accommodating even further recesses and to avoid sharp edges in the region of its key spine, the profile region (15) of the key, like its indentation region (13), has a round-cylindrical, particularly circular-cylindrical shape and is connected to the indentation region (13) via a waist region (14) which is both short and narrow.

Key for a locking cylinder (3) comprising a rotatably 
adjustable cylinder core (4), which cylinder core (4) contains 

a key channel (11) which issues freely into the peripheral 
surface of said cylinder core (4), particularly of locking 

systems, and comprising a profile region (15) which lies 
facing the key back which extends in the key insertion position 

flush with the cylinder core peripheral surface and which 
profile region is provided with lateral recesses (e.g 17, 18) 

and further comprising a cut region (13) which lies facing the 
opposite key front and can be inserted into the cylinder core 

middle region of the key channel (11), which cut region has a 
round cylindrical, in particular regular cylindrical form and 

comprises therein on the periphery and axially offset milled 
slots, crevasses or the like, cuts (16) for the purpose of 

coordinating tumble elements (8) which are mounted in the 
locking cylinder (3) in a radially adjustable manner with 

respect to the core middle of said locking cylinder, characterised 
in that the profile region 
(15) of the key has the 
same round cylindrical, particularly regular cylindrical form 

as the cut region (13) of said key and is connected to the cut 
region (13) by way of a neck region (14) which is of equal 

length and width. 
Key according to claim 1, characterised in that it is provided 
in its round cylindrical profile region (15) with profiled  

 
longitudinal grooves (17) and/or recesses (18) to allow entry of 

blocking bodies which are also present in the cylinder core (4), 
for example in the form of blocking spheroids (19) or blocking 

rollers. 
Key according to claim 2, characterised in that it is also 
provided in its neck region (14) in particular with variable 

profiled longitudinal grooves (17'). 
Key according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that its round cylindrical profile region (15) is smaller in 

diameter than its round cylindrical cut region (13). 
Key according to any of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that its round cylindrical profile region (15) has the same 

diameter as its round cylindrical cut region (13). 
Key according to claim 5, characterised in that it is formed 
as a turning key (12') which comprises in a symmetrical arrangement 

in relation to its middle turning axis the same cuts (15') 
in its profile region as in its cut region (13'). 
Key according to any of the claims 1 to 6 comprising a key 
stop (21) which defines its insertion depth in the key channel 

(11) of the locking cylinder (3), characterised in that the key 
stop (21) in the neck region (14') of the key (12') lies within 

the end face region of the associated locking cylinder core (4).  
 
Key according to claim 7, characterised in that the key stop 
is formed as a rectangular body (21) inserted into a round recess 

(22) which is present on one side in the neck region of the key. 
Key according to claim 7, characterised in that the key stop 
is formed as a through pin (21') which penetrates a transverse 

bore (21") in the key shaft and protrudes on both sides out of 
said transverse bore. 
Key according to claim 5, characterised in that the key 
shaft (12â€´) is disposed in an asymmetrical manner with respect 

to the key head (12IV).
