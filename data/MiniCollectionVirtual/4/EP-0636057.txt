<ABSTRACT>
An abrasive article (20) includes a substrate (22) having a front side (24) and back side (26) with an abrasive material (28) bonded to the front side of the substrate. Indicia (30) are disposed on the substrate so that the indicia are viewable from the front side of the substrate in a normal non-mirror image readable from left to right.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an 
abrasive article in which abrasive grains are bonded to a 
backing. On an abrasive article, indicia in the form of 
printed information are placed on the back side, which is 
the side opposite from the front side. The front side 
contains the abrasive grains or grit. The indicia 
typically includes a grade number, a product name or other 
identification. The grade number refers to the average 
particle size or the particle size distribution of the 
abrasive grain. Printing on the back side of some prior 
art abrasive articles is incidentally viewable from the 
front side due to the substrate being translucent. 
However, the information is not readable since it is in a 
mirror image. Such a product has been sold under the 
trademark IMPERIAL MICRO FINISHING FILM by Minnesota 
Mining and Manufacturing Company of St. Paul, Minnesota. Abrasive articles are typically converted into a 
wide variety of forms such as sheets, discs, or belts. It 
is well known to attach the discs or sheets to a backup 
pad or support pad during use such as with a pressure 
sensitive adhesive. When the indicia is disposed on the back side of 
the abrasive article, the information cannot be seen if 
the abrasive article is opaque. If the abrasive article 
is translucent, only a mirror image of the indicia is seen 
and it is difficult to discern the indicia. Information 
which cannot be read by viewing the front of the abrasive 
article has several disadvantages. First, an operator may 
want to check the particular grade of an abrasive article 
if the operator forgets which grade of abrasive article is 
being used when the abrasive article is attached to a 
back-up pad or support pad. Secondly, if a second 
operator or new operator uses the same abrasive article, 
the second or new operator may not know the particular  
 
grade of the abrasive article. In both instances, the 
operator has to remove the abrasive article from the pad 
in order to check the grade, the product identification, 
or the manufacturer. Then, if possible, the abrasive 
article is remounted on the back of the pad. If not, then 
a new abrasive article has to be attached to the pad. 
Another disadvantage relates to packaging of the abrasive 
article. Generally, in order to check the grade of the 
abrasive article, an abrasive article has to be removed 
from the package in order to view the indicia containing 
the grade designation. The Steinhauser et al. U.S. Patent 3,849,949

An abrasive article (20) comprising: 

a substrate (22) having a front side (24) and a 
back side (26); 
a layer of abrasive material (28) bonded to the front 
side of the substrate; and 
indicia (30) disposed on the substrate, 
substantially all the indicia being viewable from the 

front side of the substrate through the layer of abrasive material 
in a non-mirror image readable from left to right. 
The abrasive article (20) of claim 1 wherein 
the substrate (22) is light transmissive and the indicia 

(30) are disposed on the back side of the substrate. 
The abrasive article (20) of claim 1 wherein 
the substrate (22) is opaque and the indicia (30) are 

disposed on the front side of the substrate.

the layer of abrasive material (28) is light transmissive. 
The abrasive article (20) of any of claims 1 to 4 and 
further comprising: 


an adhesive (25) adhering the abrasive material 
(28) to the front side (24) of the substrate, the adhesive 

being light transmissive. 
The abrasive article (20) of any of claims 1 to 5 and 
further comprising: 


means for releasably attaching the article to a 
support pad (31).

loop fastener having a first portion (34) containing a 
plurality of hooks and a second portion containing a  

 
plurality of loops (32) and wherein either the first or 

the second portion is attached to the back side of the 
substrate and wherein then the other first or second 

portion is attached to the support pad (31). 
The abrasive article (20) of claim 7 and 
wherein the portion of the hook and loop fastener attached 

to the substrate is opaque. 
The abrasive article (20) of claim 7 or 8 and 
further including: 


an adhesive (36) for adhering the portion of the 
hook and loop fastener to the back side of the substrate 

(22). 
The abrasive article (20) of claim 9 
wherein the adhesive is opaque. 
The abrasive article (20) of any of claims 1, 2 and 4 to 10 
wherein the substrate (22) is a light transmissive 

polymeric film and the indicia are disposed on the back 
side of the polymeric film.
