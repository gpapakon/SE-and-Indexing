<ABSTRACT>
Built-in glass ceramic hob (ceramic glass hob, ceramic) (1) having a plurality of cooking surfaces (3 to 6) which are assigned in each case one induction heating device (12, 13) and the induction heating devices and their switching and control devices (30, 31) being coolable by a fan (blower) (18). The built-in glass ceramic hob (1) is provided with at least one air-suction opening (air intake opening) (8 and 9, respectively) at the top which is a component of an air ducting shaft (14). The air ducting shaft (14) is subdivided into a vertical and into a horizontal air ducting part (15, 16), the air suction side (17) of the fan (18) being assigned to the horizontal air ducting part (16). The air blow-off side (19) of the fan (18) is joined by a cooling-air channel (20) which runs parallel to the induction heating devices (12, 13) and at whose end the cooling-air flow is subdivided into a front blow-off air flow and a return-air flow which is guided towards the rear.
