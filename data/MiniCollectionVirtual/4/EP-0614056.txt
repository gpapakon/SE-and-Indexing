<ABSTRACT>
In an air discharge nozzle 9 provided at a lower end of an air path in the body of the 
air-conditioning equipment, blown air is guided in the left/right direction by a plurality 

of guide vanes 8 pivotally held by the nozzle. The guide vanes are controlled so that 
when they are inclined, to deflect the air, the angle of inclination of each guide vane 

becomes larger as the guide vane is closer to the end of the set of guide vanes in the 
direction towards which the air is to be deflected. As a result the air flow is controlled 

accurately in the left/right direction, so that the air flow will reach the intended 
location.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air-direction 
adjusting apparatus in an air-conditioning equipment, which 
is disposed at a blow-outlet thereof. Figs. 60 to 62 are views showing an air-direction 
adjusting apparatus in a conventional air-conditioning 
equipment as disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Unexamined 
Publication No. Sho-58-69735. Fig. 60 is a perspective view 
of a body of the air-conditioning equipment; Fig. 61 is a 
cross section of Fig. 60; and Fig. 62 is a vertical section 
of Fig. 60. In the drawings, the reference numeral 1 represents a 
body of an air-conditioning equipment; 2, a front panel 
having a suction inlet 3 and for covering the front surface 
of the body 1; 4, a blow-outlet having an opening at a front 
lower portion of the body 1; 5, a heat exchanger disposed so 
as to face the suction inlet 3; 6, a casing provided in the 
inside of the body 1 and for forming an air course 13; 7, a 
change vane provided at the blow-outlet 4 so as to be 
pivotally mounted to left and right side walls 11 and 15 of 
the front panel 2 by a shaft 16 mounted to left and right 
end portions of the blow-outlet 4 and for changing the air  
 
direction to the horizontal direction, the perpendicularly 
falling direction or an oblique direction; 8, a plurality of 
parallel guide vanes provided between walls 10 and 14 at 
left and right side portions of a blow-out nozzle 9 so as to 
be pivotally held by a pivotal shaft 17 and for changing the 
air direction to the left-rightwise direction; 9, a blow-out 
nozzle disposed under the casing 6 and cooperating with the 
casing 6 to form an air course; 12, a fan disposed on 
the air course 13 at the blow-out 4 and driven by the motor 
18; and 19, coiled springs suspended from the shaft 16. Fig. 63 is a detailed view for explaining the neighbor 
of the right-side guide vanes depicted in Fig. 62; and Fig. 
64 is a perspective view of one of the guide vanes depicted 
in Fig. 63. In the drawings, the reference numeral 20 represents a 
left/right changing rod pivotally mounted to the plurality of 
guide vanes 8 by shafts 21 and for changing the angles of the 
guide vanes 8 to a left-rightwise arbitrary value 
simultaneously. The operation of the apparatus will be described below. 
When the fan 12 is driven in the conventional air-conditioning 
equipment constructed as described above, air is 
sucked from the room through the suction inlet 3, passes 
through the heat exchanger 5 so as to be cooled in an 
air-cooling mode or heated in an air-heating mode, falls

An air-direction adjusting apparatus in an air-conditioning equipment in 
which a blow-out nozzle (9;201) having an oblong section extending in a left/right 

direction is provided in the outlet (4) of an air course (13) formed in the inside of a 
body of the apparatus and in which blown air passed through the air course is blown out 

of the outlet (4) while guided with respect to the left/right direction by at least one set
