<ABSTRACT>
A terrestrial television broadcast converter comprises input means 2 for receiving a 
digital signal; a demodulator 4 for demodulating a received digital signal; a digital 

signal processor 6 for decompressing and demultiplexing a digital signal; a digital to 
analogue converter; and means for transmitting the signal to an analogue television 

receiver. 
The converter enables an analogue television set to receive terrestrial digital television 
signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a terrestrial television broadcast system converter for use in 
conjunction with a television receiver. More particularly, but not exclusively, the 
invention relates to a converter for enabling a television receiver adapted to receive 
signals based upon the NTSC, PAL, SECAM or D2-MAC systems to be used in 
conjunction with a different television broadcasting system. Terrestrial television broadcasts have conventionally been made in accordance with one 
of a number of broadcasting systems. The NTSC (National Television System 
Committee of the USA) system was adopted in the USA in 1953. It uses 525 picture 
lines and a 60 Hz field frequency. It has since been adopted in Canada, Mexico and 
Japan. SECAM (Séquentiel Couleur à Mémoire) was originally developed in France in 
1959 and PAL (Phase Alternation by Line) was developed in Germany in 1962. These 
systems, which are now in use throughout most of the world, were designed to 
overcome some of the defects of NTSC (in particular the effect of differential phase 
distortion) and have been improved over the years. Both of these systems use 625 
picture lines. A further system called D2-MAC has been adopted in a number of other 
European countries. One thing which all of these systems have in common is that they are analogue 
systems. Analogue systems suffer from a number of drawbacks. For example, 
receivers can be susceptible to interference by sinusoidal signals and echo effects 
caused by transmission delays. In addition, analogue transmission makes inefficient use 
of the electromagnetic spectrum. These inadequacies have led to new terrestrial 
television transmission standards being agreed internationally. These new standards 
are based upon more efficient digital techniques.  Unfortunately, existing television receivers are not compatible with digital television 
transmission. This means that the implementation of a digital transmission standard 
would require consumers to purchase new digital television receivers before digital 
television broadcasts could be enjoyed. This is obviously undesirable, from the 
consumer's point of view. The present invention, therefore, sets out to provide means for enabling a conventional 
analogue television receiver to receive terrestrial digital television broadcasts. According to the invention there is provided a television signal converter comprising 
input means for receiving a digital signal; a demodulator, for demodulating a received 
digital signal; a digital signal processor, for
