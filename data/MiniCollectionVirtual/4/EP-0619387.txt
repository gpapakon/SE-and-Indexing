<ABSTRACT>
The density of a melt precisely represents the stability of 

the melt, so that the initiation of pulling-up operation can be 
determined on the basis of the changing rate of the density. The 

pulling-up operation may be started when the density becomes 
constant, or when the changing rate of the density with respect to 

the temperature becomes smaller. Since the melt or clusters do not 
include different minute structures, an obtained single crystal is 

of high quality free from minute faults or dislocations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pull method of producing a
Si single crystal from a Si melt
under a stabilized condition inhibiting the formation of
minute faults or dislocations, and also relates to an apparatus
useful for said pull method.Czochralski method is a representative method for the growth of
a single crystal from a melt.Czochralski method uses a crucible 2 provided in a closed
chamber 1 as shown in Fig. 1. The crucible 2 is supported by a
supportor 3 so that the crucible 2 is capable of rotation and/or
vertical motion. There are concentrically disposed a heater 4 and a
heat insulator 5 around the crucible 2.A raw material is received in the crucible 2 and intensively
heated by the heater 4 to prepare a melt 6. The melt 6 is held at a
temperature suitable for the growth of a single crystal.When a seed crystal 7 being hung from a rotary winder 10 through
a wire 9 is brought into contact with the melt 6, a single crystal 8
grows on the seed crystal 7 so that the crystalline orientation of
the seed crystal 7 is transferred to that of the growing crystal 8.
The seed crystal 7 is then rotatingly pulled up in response to the
growth of the single crystal 8. The crucible 2 is descendingly
rotated by the rotating motion of the support 3, too. The obtained single crystal 8 is sheared to wafers to be used
as substrates for semiconductor devices.By the way, semiconductor substrates of higher quality are
demanded, as semiconductor devices are integrated with higher
density. In order to obtain a semiconductor substrate of high
quality, it is necessary to inhibit dislocations or crystalline
faults which would be included in the single crystal. On the other
hand, the production of substrates for semiconductor devices with
high productivity requires the improvement which enables the growth
of a single crystal larger in diameter.According to Czochralski method, a single crystal is pulled up
from a melt held at a high temperature, so that the quality of the
obtained single crystal is significantly affected by the conditions
of the melt near the interface of crystal growth.There are clusters, i.e. agglomerates different in minute
structures, in the melt which changes physical properties to larger
extents. The minute structures are varied in response to the
thermal hysteresis of the melt. In case where a melt just after
prepared by melting a polycrystalline raw material is held at a
temperature slightly higher than its melting point, there remain a
lot of clusters having covalent bonds which have tansferred
