<ABSTRACT>
A hood top assembly 10 for a motor vehicle has an outer 
panel 12 and an inner panel 14. At the front of the 

assembly the inner and outer panels are spot-welded together 
to form a flange 20, and a grille 16 is mounted on this 

flange to form an integral part of the hood top. The skin 
panels of sheet metal do not encircle the grille, and the 

grille which is a plastics moulding supports parts of the 
hood top release mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hood top assembly for a motor 
vehicle. The hood top covers the front part of the vehicle 
and usually closes the engine compartment. The hood top is 
sometimes referred to as the bonnet but the term 'hood top' 
will be used in this specification. The styling of the front of a new vehicle is very important 
as this part of the vehicle has a great visual impact. As 
a result, vehicle stylists demand considerable freedom to 
express their ideas in this part of the vehicle. The hood 
top assembly is inevitably an important, if not the most 
important, part of the front end appearance. However engineering considerations also have to be met to 
ensure that the hood top assembly has sufficient strength to 
be stable, particularly when the hood top is being opened. 
This requires that the sheet metal at the front edge of the 
assembly has the necessary structural reinforcement. This 
reinforcement is normally formed by a metal structure at the 
forwardmost extremity of the assembly. DE-C-3 738 505 discloses a hood top assembly for a motor vehicle, 
the assembly comprising a metal outer skin panel, metal inner 
skin panels secured to the outer skin panel and a plastics 
grille that forms the forward most extremity of the assembly. 
The grille is secured to the inner skin panels.  
 According to the present invention there is provided a hood 
top assembly for a motor vehicle, the assembly comprising a 
metal outer skin panel, a metal inner skin panel secured to 
the outer skin panel and a plastics grille, the grille being 
secured to a flange at the front edge of the inner and outer 
skin panels so that the grille forms the forward most 
extremity of the assembly and the flange being formed by 
overlapping peripheral edges of the inner and outer panels, 
which peripheral edges are welded to one another prior to 
the grille being secured to the flange. Preferably the flange includes landing points for the  
 
grille, the landing points being formed by surfaces lying at 
right angles to the vehicle centreline, when the hood top 
assembly is mounted on a vehicle. The inner and outer skin panels are preferably joined to one 
another by a clinch flange surrounding the whole of the 
periphery of the assembly, apart from the area where the 
grille will be connected to the inner and outer panels. The overlapping peripheral edges of the inner and outer 
panels are preferably spot-welded together. The grille preferably has moulded-in threaded studs which 
pass through holes in the flange and

<CLAIMS>
A hood top assembly (10) for a motor vehicle, the 
assembly comprising a metal outer skin panel (12), a metal 

inner skin panel (14) secured to the outer skin panel and a 
plastics grille (16) that 

forms the forward most extremity of the assembly (10), 
characterised in that the grille (16) 

is secured to a flange (20) at the front edge of the inner 
and outer skin panels, 

the flange being 
formed by overlapping peripheral edges of the inner and 

outer panels, which peripheral edges are welded to one 
another prior to the grille (16) being secured to the flange 

(20). 
A hood top assembly as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the flange (20) includes landing 

points (36) for the grille (16), the landing points being 
formed by surfaces which will lie at right angles to the 

vehicle centreline when the hood top assembly (10) is 
mounted on a vehicle. 
A hood top assembly as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the inner and outer skin panels (12, 

14) are joined to one another by a clinch flange surrounding 
the whole of the periphery of the assembly (10), apart from 

the area where the grille (16) will be secured to the flange 
(20) formed by the inner and outer panels. 
A hood top assembly as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the overlapping peripheral edges of 

the inner and outer panels (12, 14) are spot-welded 
together. 
A hood top assembly as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the grille (16) has moulded-in  

 
threaded studs (46) which pass through holes (32) in the 

flange (20) and accept fastening nuts (48) to secure the 
grille to the flange, together with location spigots which 

engage in location holes on the flange to ensure accurate 
positioning of the grille relative to the flange. 
A hood top assembly as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the front lower edge of the hood 

assembly (10) is formed by the grille (16). 
A hood top assembly as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the grille (16) includes reinforcement 

webs (66) which brace the lower edge of the grille against 
the inner panel (14). 
A hood top assembly as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the hood top latch release mechanism 

(56, 64) is mounted, at least in part, on the grille (16). 
A hood top assembly as claimed in Claim 8 when 
dependent on Claim 7, characterised in that the hood top 

latch release mechanism (56, 64) can be operated by a 
pivoting handle (56) which is pivoted between the 

reinforcement webs (66) of the grille. 
A hood top assembly as claimed in any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the inner skin panel (14) has a 

reinforcement section (40) which contacts, from the inside, 
the outer skin panel (12) in the area where force would be 

applied to close the hood top.
