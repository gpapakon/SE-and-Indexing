<CLAIMS>
Separator for waste water containing suspended solids comprising an inlet 
pipe, a clear water discharge pipe at the bottom and a suction pipe, 

mounted through an upper maintenance manhole, with an opening within 
the range of the scum layer to withdraw the accumulated suspended 

solids, 
characterized in that
 the suction pipe (11) is provided 
with a height adjusting device (13, 14) for its lower suction opening (11') 

which will be adjusted to the separation line scum/water which was 
sensored before and that a baffle plate (15) is positioned mostly 

horizontally at a determined distance in front of the suction opening (11') to 
prevent that water will be withdrawn also. 
Separator according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
suction pipe is formed as a suction hose (24) attached to the upper 

mounting support of the lengthwise adjustable flexible height-adjusting 
device (25). 
Separator according to the claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 
the free section of the maintenance manhole (2) which is not taken by the 

suction hose or height-adjustable suction pipe (11) resp., is covered by a 

grating (16) whose openings are smaller than the diameter of the suction 
elements (11, 24).
