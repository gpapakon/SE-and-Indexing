<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mining industry, 
and, in particular, to mine support equipment, viz. to 
yielding roof bolting. At present, yielding roof bolting is constructed 
in the form comprising a wave-like rod with a lock set 
at the back of a hole. The rod is placed in a holder 
manufactured in the shape of resilient wavy metallic 
strips which are bundled with elongating clamping clips 
at the ends. The degree of pliability is defined by the 
"waves" of the rod being limited by its straightening 
alone. The straightening is hindered with the "waves" 
of the holder due to friction caused by the movement 
along the hole's walls (SU, Inventor's Certificate 
No. 1283411). Restricted pliability and small capacity in the 
pliable state do not welcome wide application of known 
supports. Besides, the design construction is stocked 
with expensive components. Another type of roof bolting comprising a metallic 
rod with knurled surface and a resilient baloon as a 
strut which is mounted in a longitudinal slit made in 
the rod has been provided while the knurling details of 
the rod are made in the form of mobile spring pins (SU, 
Inventor's Certificate No. 1421872).  This arrangement possesses some pliability but 
limited to a great extent as the knurling details are 
manufactured in such a way that they do not slide along 
the walls of a hole but rigidly interact with it hardly 
shifting by gravity along the walls of a hole together 
with rock displacement thus promoting roof strata separation. 
The arrangement is rather complicated in manufacture 
to provide reliability and its field of application 
is limited by its rather little degree of pliability. Basic claim is a mental concept to arrange details 
of a simple design of yielding roof bolting in such a 
way as to provide a possibility of regulating the degree 
of pliability. To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related 
ends, it is due to the fact that the yielding roof bolting 
comprising the metallic rod and the strut manufactured 
in the form of a capacity liable to expanding, 
the latter is made with a longitudinal axial crease 
forming a cavity while the metallic rod is placed in 
the cavity of the axial crease of the strut. Depending on the degree of pliability required 
from the roof bolt which in its turn is determined by 
the mining and geological conditions for the roof bolting 
application, the metallic rod can be placed along 
the entire length of the crease, can be manufactured  
 
shorter or longer than the length of the
