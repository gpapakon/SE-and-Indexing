<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sulphur-vulcanisable rubber mixture, to tyre treads produced therefrom, and to tyres having these treads. The mixture contains from 10 to 85 parts by weight of a copolymer, prepared by emulsion polymerisation, from a conjugated diene and a vinyl aromatic compound having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of between -20@C and -70@C, from 5 to 40 parts by weight of polyisoprene, from 10 to 50 parts by weight of polybutadiene, from 50 to 90 parts by weight of silicic acid, where all parts by weight are based on 100 parts by weight of elastomer, conventional additives and a vulcanisation system. This rubber mixture gives tyre treads having good abrasion resistance and a low loss factor, which correlates with low rolling resistance.
