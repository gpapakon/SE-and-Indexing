<ABSTRACT>
A micropolarimeter comprises an analyzer (1) and a detector 
(3), typically a photodetector array, having a circular 

configuration of a number N of sectors. Analyzer (1) and 
detector (3) form a unit with the analyzer assigning different 

polarization values to the sectors, which contains 
no moving parts. 
For the analyser three different embodiments are proposed: 
a glass cone, covered with a polarizing thin film stack; a 

metal grid polarizing array; an array of polarizing 
waveguides. 
The micropolarimeter (14) is used preferably in a 
microellipsometer system which further comprises, also 

positioned on a microoptical table (6), light collimating 
means (7) and polarizing means (8). Light generating means 

(11) may also be integrated into the microsensor system. 
The microsensor system serves as tool for film diagnostics, 

especially optical characterization of thin films.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to microsensor systems and to a
micropolarimeter in which the micropolarimeter is designed
to measure polarization states of light beams. The
micropolarimeter is the central component in the following
applications:
Ellipsometry for thin film diagnosticsLaser beam diagnosticsDiagnostics for polarization depending properties in
optical fibersAnalysis of optically active materials.A well established method for characterizing surfaces and
thin films is ellipsometry. The known ellipsometer use discrete
polarization optical components in various combinations.
A detailed description is to be found in R.M.A.
Azzam, N.M. Bashara, "Ellipsometry and Polarized Light",
1988, North Holland, Amsterdam.Ellipsometry is based on utilization of the variation of
detected light intensity as a function of the polarization
ellipse parameters. Typically the polarizer is fixed and
the analyzer is synchronously rotated about the light beam
axis at a constant angular velocity, which is shown in
various publications like IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin
18 (1975) 2031.The detector signal will exhibit periodic variations and is
Fourier analyzed. Using the Fourier coefficients together
with the known incident angle and the polarizer setting the
ellipsometric angles are then derived. For instrument operation precise mechanical motion of components
is required limiting the response time of the
instrument and complicating its design.Instead of rotating components some polarimeter use modulation
techniques modulating the phase and/or the azimuth
of the beam. The analysis of the data obtained is,
however, more complicated and expensive lock-in amplifiers
and modulators are needed.US Patent 4 585 348 discloses an ellipsometer having no
moving parts and a minimum number of optical components.This instrument consists of a static photometric
polarimeter and measures statically only the reflected
intensities whose polarization lie, respectively, parallel
and perpendicular to the plane defined by the incident and
reflected beams. However, this instrument determines only
the quotient of the two polarization states.For a complete determination of the Stokes parameter a
second measurement is necessary.In another kind of polarimetric systems moving or rotating
elements are avoided by using multiple detector systems.IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin 19 (1976) 1487 shows an
arrangement using four beam splitters and four detectors
which allows complete determination of the polarization
state of light reflected from a sample
