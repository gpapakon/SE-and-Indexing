<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a craze resistant transparent sheet. The sheet has 
excellent transparency and resistance to solvent crazing, particularly where crazing 
is aggravated by stress or strain. Acrylic polymers are widely used in producing sheet having a wide variety of 
uses related to acrylic properties such as weatherability, clarity, surface hardness, 
mechanical strength and heat distortion resistance. One problem with sheet made 
from conventional "melt processible" or "extrusion grade" acrylic polymers, 
however, is that the resulting sheet is subject to "crazing" or crack formation when it 
is brought into contact with common solvents such as ethanol, paint thinner, rubbing 
alcohol (isopropanol), detergents and caustic cleaning compounds. Conventional 
acrylic polymers used in making sheet have relatively poor craze or crack formation. 
resistance because, it is believed, certain limitations are imposed on such polymers 
by the requirements of conventional extrusion and melt calendering processing. 
These imposed limitations relate most notably to polymer melt viscosity affecting 
flow and handling, sometimes termed "workability," in extrusion and melt 
calendering processes. Up to this time, only the very high molecular weight acrylic 
polymers prepared by cast methods, typically having molecular weights exceeding 
one million daltons, have demonstrated excellent solvent craze resistance. Cast 
acrylic polymers, such as those made by cell or continuous casting, have a practical 
problem, beyond their relatively high production cost, in that their melt flow rate is 
so low (less than 0.1 g/10 minutes under specified melt-flow measuring conditions, 
described below, usefully relating to extrusion/melt calendering conditions) that 
they cannot be extruded and melt calendered to produce sheet - that is, their "melt 
characteristics" do not permit extrusion and melt calendering. An acrylic polymer 
having craze resistance approaching that of cast acrylic polymer and which could be 
extruded and melt calendered to produce sheet would have much value in the 
industry because it could be used to produce sheet with excellent craze properties 
more economically than by casting methods. It is known that resistance to the occurrence of craze or crack formation in the 
presence of a solvent (hereafter "solvent craze resistance") in an acrylic polymer 
sheet generally increases as molecular weight ("MW") of the acrylic polymer 
increases. But, if MW is too high, "workability" of a melted polymer
