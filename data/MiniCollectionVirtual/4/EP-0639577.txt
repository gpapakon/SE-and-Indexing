<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns antitumor
compounds. More particularly, the invention provides
novel taxane derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions
thereof, and their use as antitumor agents.Taxol® (paclitaxel) is a natural product
extracted from the bark of Pacific yew trees, Taxus
brevifolia. It has been shown to have excellent
antitumor activity in invivo animal models, and
recent studies have elucidated its unique mode of
action, which involves abnormal polymerization of
tubulin and disruption of mitosis. It was recently
approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer; and
studies involving breast, colon, and lung cancers have
shown promising results. The results of paclitaxel
clinical studies are reviewed in Rowinsky and
Donehower, "The Clinical Pharmacology and Use of
Antimicrotubule Agents in Cancer Chemotherapeutics" 
Pharmac. Ther., 52:35-84, 1991.Recently, a semi-synthetic analog of paclitaxel
named Taxotere® has also been found to have good
antitumor activity in animal models. Taxotere® is
also currently undergoing clinical trials in Europe
and the United States. The structures of paclitaxel
and Taxotere® are shown below; the conventional
numbering system of the paclitaxel molecule is
provided.
Taxol®:R = Ph; R' = acetylTaxotere®:R = t-butoxy; R' = hydrogenOne drawback of paclitaxel is its very limited
water solubility requiring it to be formulated in
nonaqueous pharmaceutical vehicles. One commonly used
carrier is Cremophor EL which may itself have
undesirable side effects in man. Accordingly, a
number of research teams have prepared water-soluble
derivatives of paclitaxel which are disclosed in the
following references:

phosphonooxymethyl ethers of taxane derivatives and
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The water
solubility of the salts facilitates preparation of
pharmaceutical formulations.The present invention relates to taxane
derivatives having the formula (A):

atom a substituted 3-amino-2-hydroxypropanoyloxy
group; n is 1, 2 or 3; m is an integer from 1 to
