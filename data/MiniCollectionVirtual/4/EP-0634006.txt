<ABSTRACT>
A load cell device includes a load cell structure formed of a suitable metal and including vertically spaced apart, generally parallel horizontal elements (14, 15) integrally formed with longitudinally spaced apart, generally parallel vertical elements (12, 13). Flexures (16, 17) interconnect each horizontal element with the vertical elements. A bending beam (18) extends between and is interconnected with the horizontal or vertical elements. When a load is applied vertically and perpendicularly to one of the horizontal elements, the load cell structure will elastically deform as a parallelogram to thereby transfer shear force to the bending beam to cause shearinduced bending of the latter. Strain gages or frequency resonator crystal elements sense the shearinduced bending and are embodied in electronic circuitry which produces an output signal caused by deformation of the bending beam. The electronic circuitry is operable to convert the output signal to a perceptive force readout.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a force sensing load cell
and, more particularly, to an electronic force sensing
load cell, in which the bending induced strain to be
measured is induced by pure shear.It has long been known to measure elastic strain
resulting from load-induced stresses of elements, such
as beams, columns, diaphragms, and the like, through the
use of electrical strain gages for the accurate
translation of the exhibited stains into convenient
related variations in electrical impedances. Wire,
foil, and semi-conductor type gages find widespread
application in such transducer devices and lend
themselves well to manufacture in highly miniaturized
form, suitable for installation upon small surface areas
of such transducer devices.Commonly, the transducers are designed and
fabricated as self-contained devices intended to satisfy
the needs of a variety of installations, but, in
general, they tend to be accurately responsive only when
the applied loading is carefully centered with respect
to a predetermined axis. In small size transducer
units, auxiliary diaphragms are often employed to
suppress undesirable lateral deflections. In larger
transducer assemblies, such as those embodied in massive
weighing platforms or the like, potentially troublesome
side forces may be resisted by strong, but somewhat
elastic, structural members, which are sometimes
referred to as flexures or stay rods. In these
arrangements, flexible guide means are provided, which
effectively parallel the load cells or transducers. In
load cells of this particular design, the critical
spring characteristics of the sensor are modified by
those of the parallel flexure members or stay rods, and
measurement accuracy and linearity can be seriously 
impaired by any erratic or non-linear behaviour of
these members. More recently, some load cells have
used force-sensitive resonators to measure the
frequency output as the function of the applied load.However, these prior art load cells, as described
hereinabove, are limited in resolution by anelastic
creep and static strain hysteresis, which is apparent
when low shear stresses, in relation to bending
stresses, exist within flexing elements of the load
cells. Further, in these prior art load cells, side
forces and effects, other than the forces to be
measured, must be offset by bridge-circuit balancing.
Bridge-circuit balancing requires that the placement of
the strain gages be exact and also requires that the
gage factors of all of the gages be the same. It has
been the general custom and

   a unitary load cell structure (10) formed by a
pair of horizontal elements (14, 15) spaced apart in a

vertical direction and connected to a pair of vertical
