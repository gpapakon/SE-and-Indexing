<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement (FIG. 1) that allows banks (15,25) of up to eight 
duplicated active devices (30-37,40-47) to be connected to a SCSI bus (14) and to 

share SCSI device IDs, and also allows multiple hosts (10,20) to share the SCSI bus 
and the connected active devices. Tri-state buffers (200) act as gates (13,23,38,48) 

to interface host adapters (12,24) of a plurality of hosts, and active devices of a 
plurality of device banks, to the SCSI bus. The gate of only one host adapter and the 

gates of only one bank of devices are enabled at any one time. Only the devices of 
the enabled bank can receive and respond to addresses from the SCSI bus, while the 

devices of the other banks are prevented from receiving and responding to addresses 

from the SCSI bus. Each host has a tri-state buffer acting as bank selector (16,26) 
for selecting one of the device banks, by enabling the gates of the devices of the 

selected bank through a bank select bus (50). Only one host's bank selector is 
enabled at any one time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed generally to communications buses, and is
directed illustratively to the SCSI peripheral bus.The Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) input/output (I/O) bus is
widely-used to connect peripheral devices, such as input and output interface devices
and mass storage devices (e.g., disks and tapes), to small and medium-size
computers, including to workstations and personal computers (PCs). As the
complexity of applications that these computers support increases along with their
power, there is arising a need to connect these computers to ever-more peripheral
devices. Furthermore, as these computers come to support more mission-critical
applications, the need for highly-reliable configurations (e.g., duplicated or
redundant configurations) is becoming pronounced.Unfortunately, the SCSI bus is not well suited to meet these needs. The
standard SCSI bus has an addressing limit of eight device identifiers (IDs) and hence
is limited to having only eight peripheral devices connected thereto. This number is
reduced to only four distinct duplicated devices in a fault-tolerant application that
relies on active-device redundancy. Furthermore, the SCSI bus standard requires
each device ID to be unique."Control to Enable One of Duplicate Circuits", IBM Technical
Disclosure Bulletin, vol. 21, no. 11, April 1979, US, pp.4413-4414, discloses a scheme
to enable one of two duplicate bus interfaces. Both interfaces use duplicate circuits, and
are addressed by the same addresses on an ADDRESS bus. The addresses from the
ADDRESS bus are received and decoded in both interfaces. But a LOCK signal
activates the output of only one interface. The state of the LOCK signal determines
whether data from an IBUS is transferred to an IBUS A or an IBUS B, and whether the
address from a REGS or a REG15 is transferred to a common BUS.Apparatus and a method according to the invention are as set out in the
independent claims  FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an illustrative computer system that
