<ABSTRACT>
A quick-release stud fastener for fastening together a pair of members (6, 7), has a stud assembly (1) which has an elongate stud (3) having a head (31), a shank (34) depending therefrom, and a single, laterally extending pawl (37) at the end of the shank remote from the head. A stud retainer includes a housing (2) for mounting on the first member (6) and which has an elongate cross-section. The shank of the stud extends from the housing for engagement of the pawl with a receptacle (5) mounted on or an aperture in the other member (7) and the head (31) of the stud is constrained for relative axial and rotational movement in the housing. A compression spring (4) is disposed around the shank (34) of the stud within the housing, to bias the head of the stud away from the other member.

<DESCRIPTION>
 QUICK RELEASE STUD FASTENERThe present invention relates to quick-relea fasteners of the type comprising a stud assembly which h a part which latches into an aperture in order to fast together a panel or first member to which the stud assemb is attached and a support or second member which contai the aperture or to which is attached a receptacle havi the aperture defined therein. Such a fastener is shown in GB-A-2134965, and the st assembly includes a T-shaped fastening portion f cooperation with one of a plurality of rectangular slo formed in a metal strip which is retained in a generally T shaped recess in the support. The stud is inserted throug the aperture and then turned through 90Â° in order to locat the arms of the "T" behind the material surrounding th aperture, thus latching the fastener. It has previousl been proposed that such fasteners include a fastenin portion comprising a helical cam slot, but this may no provide sufficient strength in certain applications.A particular problem arises when it is desired eithe to locate a fastener very close to the edge of the panel o support member or to locate plural such fasteners ver close together, ie with a close pitch, whilst maintainin the fewest number of components in the stud assembly i order to simplify assembly of the components and, at th same time, ensuring that the stud assembly is stil sufficiently strong.According to the invention described in our copendin application 9118609.8, there is provided a stud assembl for a quick-release stud fastener, the stud assembly havin a stud retainer comprising a housing having a elongate cross-section and a pair of depending retaine legs, each of which has an outwardly directed retaine flange at its free end; 

 an elongate stud having a head, a shank depending therefrom, and a T-shaped fastening portion on the shank, remote from the head; and, a coil spring having an oval cross-section, the maximum diameter of which is greater than the width of the T-shaped fastening portion (to allow the spring to be passed thereover) , and less than the maximum but greater than the minimum internal diameter of the housing, and the minimum diameter of which is less than the diameter of the head of the stud, whereby the coil spring can be located, in use, around the shank of the stud and within the housing.By such construction, the coil spring can be located around the shank of the stud by being slid axially over the T-shaped end of the stud, and the stud and spring can then be snap fitted into the housing over a step

CLAIMS
1. A stud assembly (1) for a quick-release stud fastener for fastening together a pair of members (6,7), the stud assembly having an elongate stud (3) having a head (31) , a shank (34) depending therefrom, and a single, laterally extending pawl (37) at the end of the shank remote from the head; a stud retainer comprising a housing (2) for mounting on the first member (6) and having an elongate cross- section, the shank of the stud extending from the housing for engagement of the pawl with a receptacle (5) mounted on or an aperture in the other member (7) , the head (31) of the stud being constrained for relative axial and rotational movement in the housing; and, a compression spring (4) disposed around the shank (34) of the stud within the housing, to bias the head of the stud away from the other member.
2. A stud assembly (1) for a quick-release stud fastener, for fastening together a pair of members (6,7), the stud assembly having a stud (3) having a head (31) at one end of an elongate shank (34) and a laterally extending pawl (37) at the other end; a stud retainer, which in use is mounted on a first of the members (6) , comprising a housing (2) retaining the head of the stud for axial and rotational movement therein, the shank of the stud extending from the housing for engagement of the pawl with a receptacle (5) mounted in use on or an aperture in the other member (7) , the head (31) of the stud being constrained for relative axial movement in the housing in a first angular position, for relative rotational movement in the housing at an axial position at the end of its travel towards the other member (7) , and for relative axial movement in the housing in a second angular 


position, spaced from the first angular position at the end of its rotational travel; and a compression spring (4) disposed around the shank of the stud within the housing, to bias the head of the stud away from the other member.
3. A stud assembly according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the movement of the stud head (31) within the housing is constrained by a laterally extending lug or protrusion (33) on the head which fits within a pair of axially extending internally facing grooves (26) in the wall (20) of the housing and in an angularly extending arcuate slot (27) connecting the axial slots at their ends closest to the other end of the stud.
4. A stud assembly according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the housing (2) has a pair of depending retainer legs (24) , each of which has an outwardly directed retainer flange (25) at its free end, for attachment of the stud assembly to the first member.
5. A stud assembly according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the compression spring (4) is a coil spring which fits over the pawl (37) and the end of the shank in order to be disposed around the shank (34) and underneath the head (31) of the stud.
6. A quick release fastener including a stud assembly (1) according to any of the preceding claims, and a receptacle (5) for the stud, wherein the receptacle is shaped so as to allow either the pawl (37) or a location pin (63) attached to the first member (6) , to be received therethrough.
7. A quick release fastener according to claim 6, wherein the receptacle (5) has a plurality of spaced apart holes
(51). 


8. A quick release fastener according to claim 7, wherein the holes (51) are substantially keyhole shaped.
9. An assembly comprising a pair of members (6,7), a quick release fastener according to any of claims 6 to 8, and one or a number of locating pins (63) spaced laterally from the quick release fastener.
10. An assembly according to claim 9 when dependent on claim 7 or claim 8, wherein the locating pin or pins (63) are spaced at a distance equal to, or a multiple of, the spacing of the holes (51) .
