<ABSTRACT>
The bridging plate which can swivel at its rear end about a horizontal transverse axis is located above or in a recess (7). Underneath the recess is a socket (11) for inserting the loading elements of the vehicle used for loading and unloading. The socket (11) has towards the outside of the structure (1) an insulating socket closure (12) which can be opened and closed separately from the rise and fall structure closure (9). The socket closure is pref. a wall (13) bridging the distance between a transverse support (10) and the base of the socket. The wall can fold inwards. The base of the recess is covered only in part by an insulating wall for swivelling in the bridging plate.

Building (1), in particular cold storage depot 
or building with enhanced indoor temperature, 

having a loading bridge (5) positioned in the 
area of its lockable building opening (2), the 

bridge-plate of which is slewable at its rear 
end around a lateral axis (6) and is mounted 

above or in a recess (7) for swinging in said 
bridge-plate and which is equipped at its free 

end with an extendible and retractable 
projection (8) for resting on the platform of a 

vehicle standing in front of the building 
opening for being loaded or unloaded, wherein 

the loading-bridge in its state of rest is 
positioned behind the riseable and lowerable 

building-closure (9), which is lowerable into 
the recess and on the front side locking it in 

its lowered position, whereby a pocket (11) for 
inserting loading equipment of the vehicle to 

be loaded or unloaded is disposed below the 
recess,
 
characterised in that
 
the pocket (11) comprises on the outside of the 

building an insulating pocket closure (12), 
which can be opened and closed independently of 

the building closure (9). 
Building according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the pocket closure (12) is formed as a 

wall (13), which spans the distance between a  
 

cross running sustainer (10) and the bottom of 
the pocket (11). 
Building according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the wall (13) can be 

moved towards the inner side, preferably by 
tilting, and in particular the wall can be 

tilted around a horizontal axis, which is 
preferably positioned on the upper end. 
Building according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the bottom of the recess 

(7) is only partially covered by an insulating 
wall (17). 
Building according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, 
characterised in that the wall (13) can be 

moved by drives, wherein sensors are provided 
capable of sensing the presence of insertable 

loading equipment for producing an actuation 
signal. 
Building according to claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the sustainer (10) takes 

the form of a cornered profile with a vertical 
front and a horizontal upper leg. 
Building according to claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 
6, characterised in that the wall (13) is 

broader than the building-closure (9). 
Building according to claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 
7, characterised in that the wall (13) can be 

moved along guiding devices (20, 27), 
preferably upwards into a horizontal position. 
Building according to claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 
or 8, characterised in that the wall (13) has a  

 
length, which is adapted to the depth of the 

recess (7). 
Building according to claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8 or 9, characterised in that the wall (13) 

is foldable. 
Building according to claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 9 or 10, characterised in that the wall 

(13) comprises at least one roller (19) at its 
lower edge and/or at the outer side. 
Building according to claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8 9, 10 or 11, characterised in that the 

wall has a curved outer surface.
