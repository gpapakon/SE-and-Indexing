<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides certain 
indolinesulfonamide and substituted-indolesulfonamide 

derivatives of the formula 

wherein: 

R¹ is C₁-C₆ alkyl;
 

R² and R³ are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, 
halo, C₁-C₆ alkyl, and trifluoromethyl, provided that no more than one of 

R² and R³ can be hydrogen;
 

and methods for using them in the treatment of susceptible neoplasms in 
mammals. Also provided are certain novel pharmaceutical formulations 

employing these indolinesulfonamide and substituted-indolesulfonamide 
derivatives in combination with a carrier, excipient or diluent, as well as 

processes for preparing the compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
In recent years fundamental advances have been 
made in the development of chemical agents and regimens of 
therapy to combat neoplastic diseases. Despite these 
continuing advances, cancers continue to exact intolerable 
levels of human pain and suffering. The need for new and 
better methods of treating neoplasms and leukemias 
continues to fuel efforts to find new classes of antitumor 
compounds, especially in the area of inoperable or 
metastatic solid tumors, such as the various forms of lung 
cancer. Of the one million new cases of cancer diagnosed 
in the United States each year, more than 90% represent 
non-hematopoetic tumors, where improvements in five-year 
survival rates have been modest, at best. B.E. Henderson, 
et al., Science, 254:1131-1137 (1991). The recent avalanche of information regarding 
the basic biological processes involved in neoplasms has 
led to a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity of 
tumors. Ongoing work has led to the realization that 
individual tumors may contain many subpopulations of 
neoplastic cells that differ in crucial characteristics 
such as karyotype, morphology, immunogenicity, growth rate, 
capacity to metastasize, and response to antineoplastic 
agents. It is because of this extreme heterogeneity 
among populations of neoplastic cells that new 
chemotherapeutic agents should have a wide spectrum of 
activity and a large therapeutic index. In addition, such 
agents must be chemically stable and compatible with other 
agents. It is also important that any chemotherapeutic 
regimen be as convenient and painless as possible to the 
patient. This invention reports a series of novel 
sulfonylureas that are useful in the treatment of solid  
 
tumors. These compounds are orally active -- which, of 
course, results in less trauma to the patient -- and are 
relatively non-toxic. These compounds also have an 
excellent therapeutic index. The compounds and their 
formulations are novel. Many sulfonylureas are known in the art. 
Certain of these compounds are known to have hypoglycemic 
activities, and have been used medicinally as such agents. 
In addition, some sulfonylureas have been taught to have 
herbicidal and antimycotic activities. General reviews of 
compounds of this structural type are taught by Kurzer, 
Chemical Reviews, 50:1 (1952) and C.R. Kahn and Y. 
Shechter, Goodman and Gilman's, The Pharmacological Basis 
of Therapeutics, (Gilman, et al., 8th ed. 1990) 1484-1487. Some diarylsulfonylureas have been reported as 
being active antitumor agents.
