<ABSTRACT>
The present invention has a structure provided with a hook 39 for hooking to
an arcus posterior 11 in an atlanto 1, in which a cable 41 which can freely bend is

integrally provided in a base portion of the hook 39, and the hook 39 is provided with a
projection 43 on a surface hooked to the arcus posterior 11. Further, a screw hole 29 is

provided in a head portion 27 of a screw 21 freely inserting to the atlanto 1 from an
epistropheus 3, an engagement groove 31 communicated with the screw hole 29 is

provided, a cable 41 provided in the hook 39 freely hooked to the arcus posterior 11 in
the atlanto 1 is provided so as to be freely engaged with the engagement groove 31, and

a fixing screw 33 freely fixing the cable 41 engaged with the engagement groove 31 is
provided so as to be freely meshed with the screw hole 29.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hook cable according to claim 1 used for a fixing method with respect to an atlantoaxial joint unstable symptom between a first cervical vertebra (an atlanto) and a second cervical vertebra (an epistropheus), and a system according to claim 4 for fixing the same.A hook cable as defined in the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in US 4,275,490. The hook cable includes a hook and an elastomer member in the form of a section of conventional surgical tubing which is to be fixed by stretching over a portion of a coupler provided on the hook and a coupler provided on a screw. The hook is fixed by means of its hook tip.US 5,725,582 describes a surgical implant comprising a hook and cable structure having a cable which is freely bendable, and is attached to the hooks by means of further hooks.As a method of fixing an atlantoaxial joint between an atlanto (a first cervical vertebra) 1 and an epistropheus (a second cervical vertebra) 3, for example, as shown in Figs. 1A and 1B, there is executed a method of obliquely screwing and inserting a pair of right and left screws 9 to lateral roots 7 of the atlanto 1 from an inferior articular process 5 of the epistropheus 3, aligning right and left autologous bones 15 between an arcus posterior 11 of the atlanto 1 and an arcus vertebrae 13 of the epistropheus 3, and fastening the arcus posterior 11 and the arcus vertebrae 13 by a titanium wire 17.As described above, in the related art, since it is necessary to wind the titanium wire 17 around the arcus posterior 11 of the atlanto 1 and the arcus vertebrae 13 of the epistropheus 3, it is hard to perform the winding operation, and since it is necessary to pay attention so as to prevent such as a bone resection loss or a breakage of the titanium wire 17 from being generated at a time of fastening the titanium wire 17, there is a problem that it is necessary to pay attention to the fastening operation.The present invention is made by taking the problem as described above into consideration. According to claim 1 there is provided a hook cable provided with a hook for hooking to an arcus posterior in an atlanto, wherein a cable which can freely bend is integrally provided in a base portion of the hook. The hook is provided with a projection on a surface hooked to the arcus posterior.According to claim 4 there is provided a system for fixing an atlantoaxial joint, in which a screw hole is provided in a head portion of a screw freely inserting to an atlanto from an epistropheus, an engagement
</DESCRIPTION>
