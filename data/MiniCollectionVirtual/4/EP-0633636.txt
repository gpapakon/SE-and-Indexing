<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor laser device comprising, a first 
clad layer (14) of the first conductivity type 

semiconductor crystal deposited on a first electrode 
layer (11), an active layer (15), a second clad layer 

(16) formed of a semiconductor crystal of a second 
conductivity type, a current barrier layer (18) having a 

stripe-like current inlet opening (23), a second 
electrode layer (20) formed of a semiconductor crystal 

of the second conductivity type, and disposed on the 
current barrier layer (18) and on the electric current 

inlet opening. A first electrode (21) is formed on the 
second electrode layer (20). A second electrode (22) is 

formed on the bottom surface of the first electrode 
layer (11). Between the current barrier layer (18) and 

the second clad layer (16) is formed a photoelectric 
current barrier layer (19) formed of a semiconductor 

crystal of the first conductivity type having a larger 
band gap than that of the active layer (15). 

This structure is especially useful for devices comprising p-type 
current barrier layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor laser devices having a
visible or near-infrared light semiconductor laser element to
be used as a source of light for a bar-code-reading device, a
pointer, a pick-up of a photo disc device, an optical measuring
apparatus and etc. 
From Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 9, no. 270 (E-253) October
26, 1985 there is known a semiconductor laser device where an
N+-GaAs substrate is provided with a clad layer consisting of a
Ga0.55Al0.45As clad layer of the N-type thereon. Further, an
undoped Ga0.86Al0.14As active layer, a Ga0.55Al0.45As clad
layer of the P-type, a Ga0.55Al0.45As current-blocking layer of
the N-type and a GaAs light-absorbing layer of the N-type are
grown in this sequence on the substrate. Further, a
Ga0.55Al0.45As layer of the P-type and a GaAs cap layer of the
P-type are then grown thereon. Here, minority carriers in a
light-absorbing layer are prevented from decreasing the current
constricting effect or the instabilization of the transverse
mode of the light outputted from the semiconductor laser
device.Further, from Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 6, no. 173 (E-129)
September 9, 1982 there is known a semiconductor laser
element where in order to obtain a high output of laser
oscillation, a stripe groove is made in a GaAs layer of the P-type
and doped with Zn. Here on a clad layer of the N-type, a
guide layer, an active layer, a clad layer of the P-type and a
cap layer of the <P+>-type are formed consecutively. The
element Zn is diffused into the GaAs layer to form a p-n
junction in the N-type clad layer to squeeze the flow of
current within the stripe grooves so as to increase the laser
output power. Further, in EP-A-0 234 955 there is described a semiconductor
laser with a specific waveguide structure. The semiconductor
laser has a GaAs substrate of the N-type. On this type a clad
layer, an active layer, and a clad layer of the P-type are
formed in this sequence so as to form a double heterostructure.
Further, there is provided an upper clad layer
defining a laser beam-guiding channel and a contact layer,
together with a contact layer that are formed on top thereon.Still further, in EP-A-0 526 220 there is described a light
emitting diode that has a small emission spot including an
isolation layer that restricts current flow to a small area of
the diode. The light emitting diode further comprises a barrier
layer that provides an energy barrier and prevents minority
carrier current flow in order to minimise the size of the light
emitting diodes
