<ABSTRACT>
A bioabsorbable copolymer is obtained from the 
polymerization of a major amount of epsilon-caprolactone and a 

minor amount of at least one other copolymerizable monomer in 
the presence of a polyhydric alcohol initiator. The copolymer 

is useful, 
inter
alia
, as a coating for a surgical suture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a medical device and, more
particularly, to a surgical suture coated with a bioabsorbable
copolymer obtainable by polymerizing epsilon-caprolactone as a
major component and at least one other copolymerizable monomer
as a minor component in the presence of a polyhydric alcohol
initiator having at least three hydroxyl groups.U.S. Patent No. 3,169,945 discloses a homopolymer of
epsilon-caprolactone obtained by polymerizing epsilon-caprolactone
in the presence of a polyhydric alcohol initiator
such as glycerol, erythritol, sorbitol, etc.U.S. Patent No. 3,912,692 discloses a homopolymer of
glycolide and a copolymer derived from glycolide and lactide
obtained by polymerizing the monomers in the presence of
inositol as initiator.U.S. Patent No. 3,942,532 discloses a suture coating
composition obtained by polymerizing lactones such as epsilon-caprolactone
in the presence of a polymethylenediol.Copolymers derived from epsilon-caprolactone and at
least one other monomer such as glycolide, lactide, p-dioxanone
and trimethylene carbonate are disclosed in U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,605,730, 4,624,256, 4,700,704, 4,788,979,
4,791,929, 4,994,074, 5,076,807, 5,080,665, 5,085,629 and
5,100,433.U.S. Patent No. 4,624,256 discloses, inter alia, a
copolymer derived from a major amount of epsilon-caprolactone
and a minor amount of a linear aliphatic diol such as
butanediol and hexanediol.U.S. Patent No. 4,643,191 discloses a copolymer
derived from the polymerization of p-dioxanone in the presence
of an initiator, e.g., an alkanol or a glycol, to form a
mixture of p-dioxanone homopolymer and unreacted monomer with 
subsequent polymerization of the mixture with lactide to form
the copolymer.U.S. Patent No. 5,076,807 discloses a copolymer
prepared by polymerizing p-dioxanone with glycolide and/or
lactide in the presence of an initiator such as a polyhydric
alcohol, e.g., glycerol, mannitol, etc.In accordance with the present invention, a medical
device, which is a surgical suture, is coated with a
bioabsorbable copolymer obtainable by polymerizing epsilon-caprolactone
as a major component and at least one other
copolymerizable monomer as a minor component in the presence
of a polyhydric alcohol initiator having at least three
hydroxyl groups.The use of a polyhydric alcohol initiator, i.e., an
alcohol possessing three or more hydroxyl groups, provides a
copolymer having a branched, or "star", configuration. The
branched structure of the bioabsorbable copolymer herein
exerts a characteristic influence on its
