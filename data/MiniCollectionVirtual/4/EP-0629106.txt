<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plasma welding and 
cutting gun. In a conventional plasma welding and cutting tool or gun, an 
operating gas is ionized by an arc formed between a nozzle and a 
electrode of different electrodes to form plasma for welding and 
cutting work pieces. Since there is not provided with any device 
in a welding or cutting gun to keep a constant operating 
pressure for the operating gas from a gas inlet towards a 
discharge orifice at the nozzle, the fluctuation of inlet gas 
pressure may influence the plasma velocity and temperature 
through the nozzle orifice to cause temperature fluctuations of 
the plasma towards the work piece, thereby being unable to 
perform the welding and cutting operation at constant operating 
temperature, resulting in poor quality and efficiency of the 
welding and cutting job, and resulting in unhomogeneous stress or 
strength of finished work piece under unstable operating 
condition deteriorate the reliability and durability of the 
engineering or product by the conventional welding and cutting 
gun. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
plasma welding and cutting gun for discharging plasma gas with 
constant outlet pressure including a gun body having a negative-electrode 
jacket for directing welding and cutting gas into the 
gun, a core tube through which the gas flows through a gas outlet 
of the negative-electrode jacket disposed around the core tube  
 
and then discharged through a nozzle secured to a lower portion 
of the gun body, and a positive-electrode sleeve secured to an 
outer portion of the gun body and connected to the nozzle, 
wherein the nozzle serves as a positive-electrode terminal and 
the gas directed into a passage between the nozzle and a 
negative-electrode terminal secured to a lower portion of the 
negative-electrode jacket will be ionized by an arc formed 
between the nozzle and the negative-electrode terminal, and then 
discharged through the nozzle to form plasma arc of high 
temperature and high velocity for welding and cutting a work 
piece, and wherein an over-pressure relief valve is provided 
between the core tube and negative-electrode jacket for 
discharging a gas streamflow through a by-pass gas discharge 
passage when a main gas streamflow having its pressure exceeding 
a pre-determined constant pressure, thereby keeping a constant 
gas pressure for the plasma main gas streamflow in order to 
enhance the stability and quality of plasma welding and cutting. The present invention will be
