<ABSTRACT>
A hose easy to install, capable of reducing the costs, having superior reliability during long-term use, and providing capability 
that inside fracture is easily found, wherein an auxiliary pressure-resistant cord layer (7) is constructed such that it can be 

deformed by the pressure of fluid remaining inside a chamber portion (9), and wherein a floating body (10) moored to said hose 
(1) is attached to a hose main body (2) via a connecting member, whereby when the deformation of said auxiliary pressure-resistant 

cord layer (7) reaches a predetermined level or higher, said connecting member is caused to break, said floating member (10) 
being thereby allowed to be detached from said hose (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hose for transporting 
a fluid such as oil or the like in the sea or in the water, 
and more particularly relates to a hose in which damage to a 
pressure cord layer can be easily found even when it is used 
in the sea or in the water. Conventionally, a hose line composed of a plurality of 
hoses connected end-to-end is used for loading a tanker with 
oil or the like, or unloading the tanker, because the tanker 
is generally moored offshore. In the case where a hose used for the hose line is 
damaged in an emergency, oil leaks out from the hose line, 
and serious environmental pollution results. Therefore, the 
hose used for the hose line has a double construction in 
which an auxiliary pressure cord layer is provided outside 
the main pressure cord layer which provides a chamber into 
which fluid that has leaked through the main pressure layer 
flows. In the case where the main pressure cord layer is 
damaged, the fluid that leaks out from the main pressure cord 
layer is retained in the chamber enclosed by the auxiliary 
pressure cord layer. Accordingly, in the prior art, if the 
outer appearance of the hose is visually inspected to be 
changed, the damage in the hose is determined. In this connection, when the hose is used in the sea, it 
is impossible to determine the occurrence of damage visually. 
Therefore, a detector is provided in the hose, by which a 
change in pressure of the fluid that has leaked out from the 
main pressure cord layer into the chamber is detected, and a 
signal sent from the detector is received by a receiver 
installed on the sea or ground, so that the occurrence of 
damage of the main pressure cord layer is determined. Examples of such a hose are described in US-A-4 259 553 and US-A-4 465 105. When the hose is used in the sea as described above, it 
is necessary to provide auxiliary apparatus such as a  
 
detector and receiver. Therefore, the installation of the 
hose is complicated, and the cost of the hose is greatly 
increased. Furthermore, the detector tends to be damaged and 
malfunctions tend to occur, so that the aforementioned 
detection system lacks reliability when it is used over a 
long period of time. The present invention has been made in view of the 
foregoing problems of the prior art. It is therefore an 
object of the present invention to provide a hose 
such that: installation of the hose is very 
easy; the cost is low; the reliability is high even if it is 
used over a long period of time; and damage in the hose can 
be
