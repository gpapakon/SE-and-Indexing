<ABSTRACT>
A novel endothelial cell molecule, VAP-1, that mediates lymphocyte binding in man, is described. Anti-VAP-1 monoclonal antibodies are described and the monoclonal antibody 1B2 is provided by this invention, as well as the hybridoma cell line (DSM ACC2041) which produces it. This invention further provides methods for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases by the administration of VAP-1 binding compounds, such as anti-VAP-1 antibodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a novel human endothelial cell adhesion
antigen, designated VAP-1, a monoclonal antibody, 1B2, that recognizes the VAP-1
antigen, and to the use of such molecules in diagnosing and treating chronic and acute
inflammatory and infectious conditions characterized by lymphocyte migration.Most mature lymphocytes continuously recirculate between the blood and
lymphatic organs (Butcher, E. C., Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol.128, 85 (1986)).
Lymphocytes leave the blood by recognizing and binding to the vascular
endothelial cells. Thereafter, they migrate between the endothelial cells into the
surrounding tissues. Lymphocyte trafficking allows the full repertoire of lymphocyte
specificities to be available for immune reactions throughout the body; and it also
facilitates the cell-cell interactions required for the generation and control of
immune responses. Lymphocyte adherence to endothelial cells is dependent on
interactions between complementary adhesion molecules expressed on both cell
types (Springer, T. A., Nature346,425 (1990); Stoolman, L. M., Cell56, 907
(1989); Osborn, L., Cell.62, 3 (1990); Pober and Cotran, Transplantation50, 537
(1990); Butcher, E.C., Cell67, 1033 (1991)). Under normal conditions, lymphocytes
mainly bind to specialized postcapillary venules called high endothelial venules
(HEV). Functionally separate lymphocyte-HEV recognition systems mediating
lymphocyte migration to peripheral lymph nodes, mucosal lymphoid organs,
synovium and skin in an organ-specific manner have been described (Butcher,
E.C., et al., Eur. J. Immunol.10, 210 (1980); Jalkanen, S., et al., Science233, 556
(1986); Picker, L. J., et al., Nature 349, 796 (1991)). In inflammation, activation of
the endothelial cell results in changes of its adhesion molecule status, which
largely determines the magnitude and type of leukocyte influx into the affected
tissue. Thus, endothelial cell molecules are a key element in controlling the
characteristics of local immune response, and obviously, a detailed understanding
of the mechanisms regulating lymphocyte traffic and leukocyte extravasation can
provide new means to clinically manipulate the inflammatory response. Since in man the endothelial cell ligands mediating tissue-selective
lymphocyte homing are largely unknown, a need exists for the identification of such
molecules.Two carbohydrate-based endothelial ligands for lymphocyte homing receptors
with molecular weights of approximately 50 kD and 90 kD, respectively, have
previously been
