<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an
oscillation circuit which is used in microcomputers, IC cards
and the like. More particularly, the invention is concerned
with an oscillation circuit which can operate stably over an
extended range of operating voltages. With the term
"microcomputer", it is contemplated to mean a small computer
system and cover small business or office computers and
personal computers. Further, the "IC card" covers those
typified by chip card, intelligent card, smart card and the
like.Heretofore, the microcomputers and the devices
mentioned above have been designed so as to operate with a
single operating voltage usually standardized to 5 volts. In
that case, it is sufficient for the oscillation circuit
incorporated in the microcomputers to operate with a single
operating voltage. In recent years, however, there arises
increasingly a demand for battery-driven microcomputers such
as notebook-size personal computers, handy-type terminals and
the like, which in turn requires oscillation circuits which
are capable of operating at various voltages within a wide
voltage range. However, broadening of the operating voltage
range of the oscillation circuit is accompanied with problems
to be solved, which will be explained below in conjunction
with a typical one of the conventional oscillation circuits.Fig. 6 is a diagram showing an oscillation circuit
known heretofore which is used in a charge pump for
internally generating voltage signals to be supplied to UART
(Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter), EEPROM
(Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read-Only Memory) and
others incorporated in microcomputers, IC cards and others.
Referring to Fig. 6, the oscillation circuit includes a NAND 
circuit 1 having first and second input terminals, a first
inverter 2 having an input terminal to which the output
terminal of the NAND circuit 1 is connected and an output
terminal connected to one end of a first capacitor 4 via a
first resistor 3. The other end of the first capacitor 4 is
grounded. A junction (i.e., node of connection) between the
first resistor 3 and the first capacitor 4 is connected to an
input terminal of a second inverter 5 which has an output
terminal connected to one end of a second capacitor 7 via a
second resistor 6. The other end of the second capacitor 7
is grounded. A junction between the second resistor 6 and
the second capacitor 7 is connected to an output terminal 8
of the oscillation circuit on one hand and connected to the
second input terminal of the NAND
