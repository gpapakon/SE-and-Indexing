developing an electrostatic latent image on the image 
bearing member (51), wherein the cartridge in the cartridge 

mount (2) is capable of taking a mounting position wherein 
the cartridge can be mounted on or demounted from the 

mount (2) and a toner supply position wherein the toner 
can be supplied into the container (1) from the toner 

cartridge, and wherein when the toner is to be 
supplied into the container (1), the toner cartridge is 

rotated in a predetermined direction from the mounting 
position to the supply position, and when the toner 

cartridge is to be demounted from the mount (2), the toner 
cartridge is rotated in the direction opposite from 

the predetermined direction from the toner supply 
position to the mounting position, the toner cartridge 

includes a container body for containing the toner; a 
toner discharge opening, provided in the container 

body, for discharging the toner from the container 
body; a shutter for shutting the discharge opening; a 

shutter support for supporting the shutter for

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner
supply apparatus and a replenishment
method usable in an image forming apparatus such as an
electrophotographic apparatus in which an
electrostatic latent image formed on an electrostatic
latent image bearing member is developed with toner
powder.In either of apparatus using one component
developer and an apparatus usable with two component
developer, when the amount of the toner in a
developing unit decreases beyond a predetermined level
as a result of developing electrostatic latent images.
the toner is supplied from a toner hopper containing
toner into a developing unit. When the amount of the
toner in the hopper decreases beyond a predetermined level,
the operator manually supplies the toner to the hopper
as a toner storage. Usually, a toner cartridge is
used for the supply.The toner cartridge is mounted on a cartridge
mounting portion of an image forming apparatus, and a
toner discharge opening of the toner cartridge is
opened to let the toner fall into the hopper.
Thereafter, the toner cartridge is removed from the
mount. Among such toner cartridges there is a type having
a shutter for closing and opening the toner discharge
opening, manually. In such a toner cartridge, after the
toner supply to the hopper, the toner discharge opening
is closed by the shutter, and the cartridge may be
removed from the mount, and therefore, it is convenient
because the toner remaining in the cartridge does not
scatter.However, if the cartridge is not securedly mounted
to the mount, the toner may scatter from the discharge
opening.In addition, if the cartridge is removed from the
mount before completely closing the toner discharge
opening with the shutter, there is a liability that the
toner remaining in the cartridge scatters from the toner
discharge opening.US 5089854 describes a toner container having a
linear slidable shutter to close a discharge opening of
the container. In use the container is fixed in a
seating recess of a replenishable hopper by a clamping
structure having a complicated toggle-type clamping
element operated by a lever.US-A-4942432 discloses a toner replenishment
arrangement wherein a screw-necked toner bottle is
attached while upright to a swingable coupling element
pivotally mounted to a toner hopper. The coupling
element is generally rectangular in form and incorporates 
a sliding shutter to close the toner bottle neck. By
swinging the coupling element and toner bottle about an
axis parallel to the plane of the toner hopper
replenishment opening,

<CLAIMS>
A toner supply apparatus for an image forming
apparatus comprising:


a toner container (3) including a container body (4)
for containing toner and having a toner discharge opening

(6), a shutter (7) linearly slidable across the toner
discharge opening between an open position in which the

toner discharge opening is open and a closed position in
which the shutter closes the toner discharge opening;
a container mounting portion (2) having a mounting
surface (18) in which is formed a receiving opening for

receiving toner from said toner container (3), said toner
container being mountable on said container mounting

portion (2) with the discharge opening (3) facing
downward toward said receiving opening; and
a toner accommodating portion (1) into which the
receiving opening of the container mounting portion

leads;

   CHARACTERIZED IN THAT

said toner container (3) is mountable on said
container mounting portion so as to be in sliding contact

with said mounting surface, and rotatable about an axis
substantially perpendicular to the mounting surface (18)

between a mounting position for mounting and dismounting
said toner container and a toner supply position for 

supplying toner to said toner accommodating portion (1);
and
in that said container mounting portion (2) has a
dismounting preventing portion (22) which becomes engaged

with said toner container when said toner container is
moved to the toner supply position to prevent dismounting

of said toner container.
