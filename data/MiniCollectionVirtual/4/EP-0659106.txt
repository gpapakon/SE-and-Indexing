<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a manganese complex catalyst having the formula: (LMn(OR)3) Y, wherein Mn is manganese in the +4 oxidation state; R is a C1-C20 radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, benzyl and radical combinations thereof; at least two R radicals may also be connected to one another so as to form a bridging unit between two oxygens that coordinate with the manganese; L is a ligand selected from a C3-C60 radical having at least 3 nitrogen atoms coordinating with the manganese; and Y is an oxidatively-stable counterion; the process includes the steps of: reacting a manganese (II) salt with the ligand L in the presence of a non-aqueous alcoholic medium and a counterion salt such as metallic sulphate to form a reaction mixture containing a manganese coordinated substance which is simultaneously oxidised and basified. The manganese complex thus formed is a useful bleach catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SYNTHESIS OF MANGANESE BLEACH CATALYSTField of the InventionThe invention concerns an improved synthesis of a manganese complex useful as a bleach catalyst.The Related ArtPeroxide bleaching agents for use in laundering have been known for many years. Such agents are effective in removing stains, such as tea, fruit and wine stains, from clothing at or near boiling temperatures. The efficacy of peroxide bleaching agents diminishes sharply at temperatures below 60°C.It is known that many transition metal ions catalyze the decomposition of H202 and H202-liberating percompounds, such as sodium perborate. It has also been suggested that transition metal salts together with a chelating agent be employed to activate peroxide compounds to render them usable for satisfactory bleaching at lower temperatures. Not all combinations of transition metals with chelating agents are suitable for improving the bleaching performance of peroxide compound bleaches. Many combinations indeed show no effect, or even a worsening effect, on the bleaching performance. A recent advance in this technology was described in U.S. Patent 5 194 416. Therein was reported a class of highly active bleaching catalysts in the form of a mononuclear manganese complex having the general formula:LMn(OR)especially the species 

 Mn(Me3TACN) (OCH3)3(PF6) .Related dinuclear manganese complexes such as the species Mn(Me3TACN)2(μ-0)3(PF6)2H20, have been synthesized and described by K. Wieghardt in the "Journal of the American Chemical Society", 1988, Vol. 110, No. 22, page 7398, as well as in the "Journal of the Chemical Society - Chemical Communications", 1988, page 1145.The synthesis route for dinuclear complexes as described in the above art involves the reaction in aqueous medium of a manganese (III) -compound, e.g. Mn (III) -triacetate, with a nitrogen-containing ligand, e.g. 1, 4, 7-trimethyl-l, 4, 7triazacyclononane, using an ethanol/water mixture as the solvent. A drawback of the aforementioned process is that only low yields of the dinuclear Mn (III) -complex can be achieved. Another problem associated with the process of the art is that, owing to the slow crystallization of the product, long reaction times are necessary. Still another problem is that besides crystallization of the desired product, decomposition also seems to occur, yielding manganese dioxide which contaminates the product. Therefore, a purification process is required when the product is to be converted into the dinuclear Mn (IV) -complex.More recently there was reported in
