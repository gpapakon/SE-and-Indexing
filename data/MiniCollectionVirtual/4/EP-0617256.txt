<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for determining a diameter of a circumferential line extending through at least one point of a circumferential surface on wheels of wheelsets having a wheel rim profile or wheel tyre profile. The aim of this method is to be able to determine the diameter on wheels of wheelsets in such a way that no impairment of the measured data is caused by lateral offset of the wheels or by crumbling and repairs. This is to be achieved by providing   - that a reference line extending concentrically with a wheel axis is determined or defined on the wheel, - that at least three light sections cut the reference line at the same instant and in a manner offset in the circumferential direction of the reference line, and as a result each one causes an intersection to lie on the reference line, - that the relative position of these intersection points on the reference line is determined in a defined reference system from recorded data of assigned receiving devices, taking account of the laws of imagery, - that the position of at least one point on the circumferential line of the diameter to be determined is determined relative to this reference system, and - that the relative position of the intersection points on the reference line is used to determine the position of the centre line of the wheel axis relative to this reference system, as well as the relative distance of the reference system from the desired circumferential line, and to determine the diameter of this circumferential line therefrom.

A method of determining a diameter of a circumferential 
line extending through at least one point of a circumferential 

area on wheels in wheelsets with a wheel-rim or 
wheel-tire profile, whereby 


a reference line extending concentric with a wheel 
axis (9,9') is determined on the wheel (3,3'), 
at least three light sections (37,37',38,40,40') which 
intersect the reference line and accordingly each form 

a point of intersection are laid out in the circumferential 
direction of the reference line displaced to 

the same point of time, 
each of these points of intersection is detected by an 
associated camera, 
the relative position of these points of intersection 
of the light section to the reference line is determined 

in a defined reference system from the pickup 
data by associated reception provisions (6,6',14) taking 

into account the imaging laws, 
the position of at least one point (46,47,48) on the 
diameter being determined is determined on the circumferential 

line (57) relative to this reference system, 
the position of the center line (56) of the wheel axis 
(9,9') and the relative distance of the reference system 

from the desired circumferential line (57), and 
accordingly the diameter of this circumferential line 

(57), are determined relative to this reference system 
from the relative position of the points of intersection 

of the light sections to the reference line. 
A provision for carrying out the method according to 
Claim 1, with at least one running surface (2) positioned 

in a measurement area, a provision including at least one 
source (4,4',7;93) of radiation with means (90,91,92) of 

generating at least three beam trees (87,88,89) for the 
generation of three light sections (37,37',38,40,40') by  

 
means of electromagnetic beam bundles on the running surface 

or a wheel (3,3'), sensor or reception provisions 
(6,6',14) for detecting the said light sections 

(37,37',38,40,40'), as well as a control-and-evaluation 
provision (30) connected to an output unit (36), whereby 

the control-and-evaluation provision (30) is connected to 
both the sensor or reception provisions (6,6',14) and to 

the provision (4,4',7;90,91,92,93) for generating the light 
sections (37,37',38,40,40') and whereby this provision 

(4,4',7;90,91,92,93) for generating the light sections 
(37,37',38,40,40') and the said reception provisions 

(6,6',14) are so positioned relative to one another that 
the generation of the light sections (37,37',38,40,40') and 

their detection is possible inside the measurement area,
 
characterized in that
 
a probe connected to the control-and-evaluation provision 

(30) is provided which determines when the wheel (3,3') has 
arrived at a measurement position and in that the control-and-evaluation 

provision (30) is so designed that it, upon 
arrival at turement position by the wheel (3,3'), simultaneously 

stores the three light sections (37, 37',38,40,40') 
detected by the reception provisions (6,6',14) on the 

running surface of the wheel (3,3') and determines therefrom 
the diameter of the wheel. 
A provision according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that two reception provisions (6,6') are so positioned to 

the means, associated with them, of generating beam trees 
(87,88,89) that their optical axes (18,18',19,19') intersect 

approximately rectangularly. 
A provision according to Claim 2 and 3, characterized 
in that two reception provisions (6,6') are so positioned 

that they, each, extend with their optical axes (18,18') a 
distance (41,41') approximately midway between the light 

sections (37,37',40,40') of a largest wheel (3') to be 
measured and of a smallest wheel (3) to be measured.  

 
A provision according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that one beam source (4,4',7;) is provided to generate each 

beam tree (86,87,88). 
A provision according to Claim 2, characterized in

optical axis (16) forms an acute angle (17) to the optical 
axis (12) of the beam source (7) or beam tree (87).
