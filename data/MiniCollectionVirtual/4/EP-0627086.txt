<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to method and apparatus
for determining, among others, the trajectory,
miss-distance and velocity of a supersonic projectile,
and to determining the approximate firing position of
such a projectile.The art has long recognized that acoustical
means may be used for determining a portion of the
trajectory of a projectile, and the art, generally, has
used such acoustical means for locating the point at
which a projectile passes into or near a training target
for scoring the accuracy of small arms fire, in lieu of
the more conventional paper targets. An example of the
foregoing is U. S. Patent 4,514,621. Basically, these
devices operate by means of a grid of acoustical sensors
in which the plane of the sensors is normal to the
trajectory of the projectile, e.g. a rifle bullet. As
the bullet passes through that grid of sensors, the
sensors can locate the passage of the bullet through
that grid of sensors by calculating the time delays of
the sensors.When two such grids are spaced apart, one
behind the other, and the path of a bullet passes
through both of the grids, a portion of the trajectory
of a bullet may also be determined, and U. S. Patent
4,445,808 is representative thereof. That patent also
points out that if a such a dual grid system is deployed
on a military vehicle, e.g. a helicopter, and enemy fire 
passes through the two spaced-apart grids, the general
direction of the trajectory of that fire may be
determined.Similar methods for locating the passage of a
bullet may use other types of sensors, such as
electrical resistance elements, rather than acoustical
transducers, and U. S. Patents 3,585,497 and 3,656,056
are representative thereof.Rather than using a grid of acoustical
sensors, curved elongated hoops with acoustical
transducers at ends thereof may be used. When a bullet
passes within the vicinity of the curved hoops, the
position of the bullet passing such curved hoops can be
calculated, and U. S. Patent 4,351,026 is representative
thereof.Curved hoops may also be used where the target
is moving within a defined field normal to the hoops,
and U. S. Patent 5,025,424 is representative of that
technology.Somewhat similarly, U. S. Patent 4,885,725
suggests a plurality of triangularly arrayed,
mechanically connected acoustical transducers, instead
of curved hoops, for determining the point in which a
bullet passes the target area and for providing some
indication of the velocity of that bullet.The foregoing patents are, primarily, directed
toward training devices for scoring
