<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a plasmid derived 
from Lactobacillus delbrueckii sp. comprising at least the 

restriction map of the Figure 1 or portion(s) thereof; the 
recombinant vector comprising the said plasmid, at least one 

DNA sequence capable of replication into E. coli and/or Lc. 
lactis and at least one marker. 
The present invention concerns also the 
microorganism transformed by the said plasmid and/or by the 

said recombinant vector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a new plasmid
derived from Lactobacillus delbrueckii sp., a recombinant
vector comprising said plasmid, the microorganism transformed
by said plasmid and/or vector and the use of the plasmid
and/or the vector for the transformation of microorganisms.A successful biological transformation of an
organism must satisfy the following three criteria:
1. Transforming DNA must enter the organism by physical or
chemical means such as electrotransformation, treatment
with inorganic ions, protoplast fusion, etc.2. Transformants must be selected with the help of one or
more markers from the non transformed cells in the
population for instance by antibiotic resistance genes
linked to the transforming DNA. This is best satisfied by
either the isolation of a resistance gene against an
antibiotic from the target host in question, or by the
engineering of a known resistance gene with expression
sequences (promoter and terminator) compatible with the
target host.3. Transforming DNA must be replicated (either autonomously
or as part of the host genome). This is best satisfied by
the isolation of replicating plasmids from the host to be
transformed and to subsequently construct vectors able to
replicate in a microorganism such as Escherichia coli 
(E. coli) or Lactococcus lactis (Lc. lactis) and in a
specific target organism such as Lactobacillus
delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus).The international patent application WO92/14825
describes a plasmid pBULI having a length of about 7.9 kb and
its derivative isolated from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.
bulgaricus M-878 strain.The restriction map of this plasmid is
characterized by the absence of restriction sites for BamHI,
EcoRI, KpnI and PstI enzymes.This plasmid is used as a vector for breeding
various microorganisms such as lactic acid bacteria and the
derivative of this plasmid is used as a shuttle vector
(lactic acid bacterium - Escherichia coli).Other shuttle vectors are described in the
documents Canadian Journal of Microbiology (vol. 38 (1992)
pp 69-74), ACTA MICROBIOLOGICA BULGARICA (vol. 27 (1991) 99
3-8) and in the Japanese Patent Application JP-A-4.218.381.The present invention aims to provide a new plasmid
derived from Lactobacillus delbrueckii sp. which can be used
to transform specific microorganisms specially Lactobacillus
bulgaricus.Another aim of the invention is to obtain a
recombinant vector comprising the said plasmid and which can
replicate in E. coli and Lc. lactis and transform specific
microorganisms,
