<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a holding device for a plurality of refuse receptacles below a work surface, preferably in a cupboard arranged below the work surface, having a standing base designed in the form of a segment of a circle which can be pivoted outwards about a vertical axis below the work surface or out of the cupboard, and preferably having a common covering for a refuse receptacle. According to the invention, screw-on bearing means (19, 25, 26, 27) are arranged on a side wall of the cupboard (1), adjacent to the cupboard door (4), or on a vertical post below the work surface (2), in which the standing base (5) and a cover (10) are mounted one above the other to be pivotable independently of each other so that they form a structural unit with the bearing means and can be released from their mounting by lifting.

Storage arrangement for more than one refuse
container (6, 7) beneath a work top (2), comprising a rack

base (5) in the form of a segment of a circle, which is
adapted to be swung out beneath the work top (2) about a

vertical axis (23), to which end screw-in mounting means
(19, 24) with mounting locations (18, 30) spaced one above

the other are provided on a side wall beneath the work top
(2) adjacent to a front door (4) and the rack base is

equipped with two corresponding mounting elements (26, 27)
by means of which the base is connected to the mounting

locations (18, 30) in a manner enabling it to be
swivelled, characterised in that the mounting elements

(26, 27) are configured on the rack base (5) in such a way
that they can be removed from the fixed mounting locations

(30, 18) and connected back to them, and that a cover (10)
for the refuse containers (6, 7) is held on the mounting

means (19) so as to be able to swivel about the vertical
axis (23) with vertically spaced mounting elements (25,

17) in corresponding mounting locations (28, 26) and is
also held in manner enabling it to be vertically displaced

and removed and connected back to them and is held back by
locking means when the rack base (5) is swung out, with

means arranged likewise on said base and on the cover (10)
raising the cover parallel to themselves.
Storage arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the mounting

means consists of a mounting bracket (19) provided with
receiving holes (28, 18, 30) and the mounting elements of

the rack base (5) consist of pins (26, 27) and the
mounting elements of the cover (10) consist of a pin (25)

and a receiving hole (17) for a pivot pin situated on a
mounting for the rack base (5). 
Storage arrangement according to either claim 1 or
2, characterised in that the rack base (5) adopts an angle

of around 90Â°.
Storage arrangement according to any of claims 1 to
3, characterised in that the refuse containers (6) form a

partial ring in the radially outer zone of the segment-shaped
rack base (5).
Storage arrangement according to claim 4,
characterised in that three refuse containers are arranged

in the partial ring.
Storage arrangement according to any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that a further segment-shaped

refuse container (7) is arranged in the radially
inner zone of the segment-shaped rack base (5).
Storage arrangement according to any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the refuse

containers (6) are lower in height in the radially outer
zone of the rack base (5) than the refuse container (7) in

the radially inner zone.
Storage arrangement according to any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the rack base (5)

has an external wall (9, 28) running all round.
Storage arrangement according to any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that partition walls

(8) are provided on the rack base (5) for defining the
position of the refuse containers (6, 7).
Storage arrangement according to claims 8 and 9,
characterised in that the external wall and the partition

walls (8) are formed by rigid wire profiles (9). 
Storage arrangement according to any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the cover (10) is

provided on its surface with one or more storage
compartments (13).
Storage arrangement according to any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the rack base (5)

is joined in a fixed or removable manner to the cupboard
door (4).
Storage arrangement according to any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the rack base (5),

the cover (10) and the mounting means (19, 24) form an
add-on constructional unit.
Storage arrangement according to any of the
preceding claims, characterised in that in addition to the

cover (10) each refuse container (6, 7) is provided with
its own lid.
