Finger guard (1) for a roll nip, in particular in a 
calender with heated rolls, in the form of a hollow body 

(4) extending along the roll nip and comprising a front 
wall (5) directed towards one roll (3) defining the roll 

nip, a rear wall (6) curved around a longitudinal axis of 
the hollow body (4) and two end walls (7, 8), bars (9, 10) 

forming the longitudinal edges of the front and rear walls 
each being at an angle to one of the rolls (2, 3) defining 

the roll nip relative to the front and rear walls (5, 6) 
and at a predetermined maximum distance (d) from the rolls 

(2, 3) which does not allow for the insertion of fingers 
between one longitudinal edge and the adjacent roll (2, 3), 

and the hollow body (4) being adjustably supported relative 
to the rolls (2, 3) at the end walls (7, 8), characterised 

in that the hollow body (4) consists of fibre-reinforced 
synthetic resin and the front and rear walls (5, 6) are 

produced separately and connected together, that the bars 
(9, 10) are formed by flanges (9a, 9b; 10a, 10) moulded in 

one piece with the front and rear walls (5, 6) and 
connected together and that the end walls (7, 8) are 

produced separately and are connected to the front and rear 
walls (5, 6) or are produced in one piece with the front or 

rear wall (5, 6). 
Finger guard according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the fibres are carbon or glass fibres or synthetic fibres 

or combinations thereof. 
Finger guard according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised 
in that the hollow body parts (5, 6, 7, 8) are connected by 

gluing.  
 
Finger guard according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that respective metal plates (11; 12) to 

which bearing journals (13; 14) are secured are embedded in 
the end walls (7, 8). 
Finger guard according to claim 4, characterised in that 
each bearing journal (13, 14) is removably clamped in a 

cross eye (18; 19) on a horizontal rod (20; 21) fixed to 
the frame and extending transversely to the rolls (2, 3).
