<ABSTRACT>
A battery apparatus (104) includes at least one cell (114) having a capacity. The battery apparatus (104) also includes a protection circuit (116) for directing the charging pattern of the at least one cell (114) to follow a predetermined format. The protection circuit (116) monitors the rate at which the battery apparatus (104) is charged and stops the charge when this rate falls below a predetermined rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BATTERY WITH PROTECTION CIRCUITTechnical FieldThis invention relates generally to batteries and more specifically to batteries having current limiting protection.BackgroundRechargeable batteries capable of tolerating high number of recharge cycles are widely used in portable radio applications which demand safe and dependable energy sources. Some portable applications, in particular communication devices, demand high energy batteries due to their high power requirements and size limitations. New cell technologies are constantly being developed to handle the additional output power requirements of such devices. Some of these new technologies demand a particular charge pattern. In other words, charging a battery utilizing these new technologies at a rate other than desired may result in permanent battery damage. Continued use and charge of these batteries at undesired rates may produce gas evaporation which may lead to explosion. An approach to curtail cell damage is the use of dedicated chargers for each cell type. Several problems are obvious with dedicated chargers: high cost, unnecessary proliferation, maintenance, and storage are some of them. Batteries using these new cell technologies are desirable in that they can provide the desired additional power without a significant size increase. Therefore, a need is felt for a battery 

 which can take advantage of these new cell technologies without the use of dedicated chargers.Summary of the InventionBriefly, according to the invention, a battery apparatus is provided having a cell and means for directing the charging pattern of the cell to follow a predetermined format. In other aspects of the present invention, the battery apparatus includes an inhibitor means for inhibiting the battery from being charged at lower than a predetermined rate.Brief Description of the DrawingsFIG. 1 shows a battery coupled to a charger in a accordance with the present invention.FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of a protection circuit in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a receiver in accordance with the present invention.Detailed Description of the Preferred EmbodimentReferring to FIG. 1 , a block diagram coupling a charger 102 to a battery pack 104 is shown. The power generated by the charger 102 is coupled to the battery pack 104 via two power lines 106 and 108. The latter serves as the ground return for all signals communicated between the charger 102 and the battery pack 104. Internal to the battery packl 04 is at least one cell 114
