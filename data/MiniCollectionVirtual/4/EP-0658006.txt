<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for conversion of an analog input signal to a digital 
representation (on 470) of the analog signal is typically employed in flash 

technology, since it is able to produce the digital representation of the analog signal 
faster and more efficiently than conventional flash converters. The circuit includes a 

plurality of resistors (402) serially coupled between two reference voltages (V
REF
, 
ground) to form a plurality of nodes (404) therebetween. A plurality of comparators 

(406), each having a first input coupled to one of the plurality of nodes and a second 
input coupled to the analog input signal, compares the analog input signal to a 

voltage potential at one of the nodes to generate first and second complementary 
output signals at the outputs of the comparators. The complementary outputs are 

then applied to a decode circuit (401) having a plurality of digital output lines 
(W,X,Y,Z) and switches (410-460) directly coupled to the digital output lines. The 

first and second complementary outputs switch the digital output lines to a first or 
second logic state in response to the first and second complementary output signals, 

thereby producing the digital representation of the analog input signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to conversion of analog signals to digital 
signals, and more particularly to a merged decoding circuit for analog-to-digital flash 
conversion. As the word "flash" implies, flash converters are employed to achieve high 
speed conversion of analog signals to digital signals. Flash converters yield a 
conversion of analog-to-digital signals in approximately one clock cycle. There are 
many ways to perform analog-to-digital conversion, but flash converters are typically 
the fastest architecture available. To understand how flash converters operate and the 
problems associated with conventional flash converters, the following example is 
presented. Figure 1 is a high-level block diagram of an example standard flash converter 
100. The flash converter 100 consists of two stages: a decoder 102 and a Read Only 
Memory (ROM) 104. The flash converter 100 generally operates as follows. An 
analog input signal is received by the decoder 102 via a bus 101. The decoder 102 
compares the analog input signal to a reference voltage located within the circuitry (to 
be described below) of the decoder 102. The decoder then generates a decoded value 
representing the voltage level of the analog signal and passes the decoded value to the 
ROM 104 via a bus 103. The internal architecture of the ROM 104 is comprised of 
standard ROM circuitry. After receiving the decoded value the ROM 104 generates 
a digital value associated with the decoded value via a bus 105. As will become more apparent from the detailed example below, there are 
many problems associated with standard flash converters, such as a flash converter 
100. For instance, the two stage philosophy shown in Figure 1 requires too much 
power, too much area on an integrated circuit chip, and is too slow for certain  
 
applications. Figure 2 is a more detailed example of flash converter 100. Figure 2 is the 
same as Figure 1, but includes a view of the detailed circuitry located within the 
decoder 102. The decoder 102 includes: a resistor string comprising a plurality of 
serially connected resistors 202A-202n (where n can be any number); a thermometer 
204 comprising a plurality of comparators 206A-206n; and a decode tip 210 
comprising a plurality of AND gates 208A-208(n-1) having outputs 209A-209(n-1). A reference voltage (VREF) is applied to the top of the resistor string and the 
bottom of the resistor string is grounded. Alternatively, a positive reference voltage 
(VREF+) is applied to the top of the resistor string
