<ABSTRACT>
To neutralise the waste water containing sulphuric acid from washing the charged (moulded) electrodes in the manufacture of lead accumulators PbO is used and the neutralisation product composed of PbSO4 and excess PbO is resupplied directly to the production of the active materials paste, while the mother liquor, after brief use as cleaning water, is subjected to a further neutralisation with PbO because of its possible content of impurities, but separately from that of the acidic electrode wash water. The lead sulphate arising in this case is passed to a leadworks for recycling, and the neutral mother liquor, after removal of the last lead residues, is discharged as purified water by means of known precipitation methods and filtration.

<CLAIMS>
A process for treating waste waters from the manufacture of 
lead accumulators, characterized in that the sulphuric-acid water 

which occurs when the charged electrodes are washed is 
neutralized with lead oxide, PbO, in that the lead sulphate 

formed as a neutralization product is separated off, together 
with excess lead oxide, from the mother liquor and is reused to 

manufacture the active mass paste, in that the mother liquor, 
after intermediate use as a cleaning water, undergoes a renewed 

neutralization procedure with lead oxide, but separated from the 
acidic water coming from the electrode washing, and in that the 

lead sulphate which occurs during this in addition to impurities 
and excess lead oxide is supplied to lead recycling through a 

refinery, while the neutral mother liquor coming from the 
cleaning water, after further precipitation procedures and 

filtration, is discharged as cleaned water. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
precipitation reagent during the further precipitation treatments 

of the mother liquor coming from the cleaning water is phosphoric 
acid or a water-soluble phosphate.
