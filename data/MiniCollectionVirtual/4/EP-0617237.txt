<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a hot water accumulator which is coupled to an energy source and circulation system and/or at least one hot water consumer, in a fixed receptacle (1) at least one insulated, telescope-like tank (3) is fastened to the receptacle cover (2), in which arrangement a withdrawal conduit (8) leads into each tank (3) and the tank(s) (3) is(are) arranged in the receptacle (1) and is(are) connected to one another or to the receptacle (1) via valves (5). Further, the volume (29, 30, 31) of the tank(s) (3) can be varied as a function of the addition and removal of liquid, in which case water at different temperatures can be introduced into the tank(s) (3) so that a temperature gradiant from a highest temperature in the innermost tank to a lower temperature in the receptacle (1) and, where appropriate, in the surrounding tank(s) results.
