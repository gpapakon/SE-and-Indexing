<ABSTRACT>
In order to comply with the requirement in accordance with encapsulation class IP4 for ventilation slots in switchgear cabinets, the ventilation slots are covered on the inside by a cover in such a manner that it is no longer possible to insert wires having a diameter of 1 mm. This requirement is satisfied according to the invention in that the covering part (3) consists of a baseplate (17) which can be fastened using the inside (13) of the door 1 of the switchgear cabinet and has passage slots (19), which are designed to correspond to the slot-like ventilation openings (5) in the door (1), which consists of a sheet-metal part, of the switchgear cabinet and have laminate-like projections (21) which are bent inwards and are used as roofing elements, in that the laminate-like projections (11, 21) on the door (1) and the covering part (15) form a V-shaped roof shape, and in that the lower free ends (23) of the projections (21) on the covering part (15) are arranged to be offset at a lower level than the lower longitudinal edges (25) of the ventilation openings (5). Furthermore, the covering part (15) is permanently connected, via snap-action hooks (27), to the door (1) of the switchgear cabinet.

Switchgear cabinet with switchgear of high current capacity, of which a door (1) is
provided with slot-like ventilation openings (5) for heat removal or for venting out and

venting in of air, which openings are protected on the outer side of the switchgear cabinet
by plate-like projections (11), which are angled outwardly from one of their longitudinal

edges, against ingress of foreign bodies and on the inner side of the switchgear cabinet by
a cover member (15), which is fastened there, against the sticking in of wires, wherein the

cover member (15) consists of a base plate (17) which is fastenable with the inner side
(13) of the door (1) of the switchgear cabinet and which has passage slots (19), which are

constructed in correspondence with the slot-like ventilation openings (5) in the door (1),
with inwardly angled plate-like projections (21) serving as roofs, and the lower free ends

(23) of the plate-like projections (21) at the cover member (15) are arranged to be offset
deeper relative to the lower longitudinal edges (25) of the ventilation openings (5),

characterised in that the door consists at least partially of a sheet metal part which at a
certain excess pressure on the occurrence of an arc fault deflects for the purpose of

controlled pressure relief in the switchgear cabinet, and that the cover member (15)
consists of an injection-moulded part of synthetic material and is so mountable at the door

(1) by means of resilient snap hooks (27), which are formed at the injection-moulded part
and the detent lugs (29) of which can detent behind the side edges (31) of the ventilation

openings (5), that the plate-like projections (11, 21) at the door (1) and the cover member
(15) form a V-shaped roof form.
Switchgear cabinet (1) according to claim 1, characterised in that the ends (33, 34)
of the plate-like projections (21) are connected with the side edges (35, 37) of the base

plate (17) by way of inclined surfaces (29, 41).
Switchgear cabinet (1) according to claim 2, characterised in that a respective snap
hook (27) is arranged at each end (33, 34) of the projections (21).
Switchgear cabinet (1) according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the cover member (15) comprises a transverse connecting web (43) which is arranged

centrally with respect to its longitudinal side and which is firmly connected with the outer
sides (45) of the plate-like projections (21) and by way of ribs (47) with the parts (49),

which are laid between the projections (21), of the base plate (17). 
Switchgear cabinet (1) according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that several cover members (15) can be combined into a larger cover unit.
Switchgear cabinet (1) according to claim 6, characterised in that each cover
member (15) has several passage slots (19) which are arranged parallel to each other and

of which the one longitudinal side (51) of the lower passage slot (19) of a first cover
member is closable by the upper longitudinal edge (53) of the base plate (17) of a second

cover member when two cover members (15) are combined together.
Switchgear cabinet (1) according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the cover member (15) can be shortened down to a smaller cover unit.
