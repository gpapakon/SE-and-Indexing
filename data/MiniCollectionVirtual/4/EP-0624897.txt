<ABSTRACT>
The electrode (11) of the present invention is 
used in a Plasma Assisted Chemical Etching process and 

comprises an inner member (47) surrounded by an outer 
member (45) defining a gap (77) therebetween such that a 

gas can flow therethrough. In the preferred embodiment, 
the inner member (47) and the concentric outer member (45) 

are both cylindrical in shape, therefore, the gap (77) has 
an annular configuration. A vertical ducting system is 

bored within the inner member (47) and directly or 
indirectly intersects the annular gap (77).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a 
Plasma Assisted Chemical Etching apparatus 
using an electrode having an inner member 
surrounded by an outer member such that an annular gap is 
formed therebetween. The computer and electronic device industries 
have become increasing competitive thereby necessitating 
that integrated circuits, used within these devices, be 
lower in cost and of higher quality. In particular, 
silicon wafer substrates, upon which the integrated 
circuitry is processed, must also be of lower cost and 
higher quality. Generally, the circuitry is formed on a 
surface of the substrate through a photolithographic 
process. It is highly desirable to control the thickness 
of the silicon layer of a Silicon On Insulator (SOI) 
substrate, for example, or to control the total thickness 
variation (TTV) of a silicon substrate since a 
photolithographic tool must be refocused in each field to 
match the substrate's varying surface height. This is 
often a time-consuming and costly process which is 
directly attributable to the poor thickness control of a 
conventional mechanically polished wafer substrate.  
 Recently a Plasma Assisted Chemical Etching 
(PACE) process has been used to etch or "figure" the upper 
surface of the substrate after the prior rough mechanical 
cutting and polishing steps. The PACE process uses an 
electrode which is positioned above the silicon wafer 
substrate. Radio frequency (RF) power is fed to the 
electrode and through a positioning table supporting the 
wafer. A gas then flows through the electrode where it is 
ionized and generates a chemically reactive plasma species 
which is then discharged onto the top surface of the 
wafer. This discharge chemically figures the surface of 
the wafer to a predetermined depth. Conventionally, a porous silicon carbide 
electrode is used in this PACE process. These electrodes 
have many open cell pockets therein such that the gas can 
pass completely through the electrode. While these porous 
silicon carbide electrodes create a good quality etched 
profile or "footprint" in the substrate, the electrode 
erodes relatively quickly and requires frequent 
replacement. Consequently, there is frequent down time 
for the PACE equipment which can be costly. Furthermore, 
particulates often erode off of the silicon carbide 
electrodes which can contaminate the surface of the wafer. Another electrode which has been experimentally 
used in the past is known as a "showerhead" design. The 
showerhead design is used with solid
