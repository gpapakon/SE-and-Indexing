<ABSTRACT>
A multi-bandwidth SAW filter (405) for an input signal (90) is provided which includes a SAW transducer (402) having a selectable length corresponding to the desired bandwidth of the filter. The SAW filter is responsive to a control signal (430) which corresponds to a selectable bandwidth of the filter to present the input signal to an appropriate length SAW transducer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW)
structures and more particularly to a SAW filter structure having
multiple bandwidths.SAW components use acoustic waves which travel at the speed of
sound. The SAW components are preferred over widely used
transmission line components because acoustic waves have a
substantially shorter wave length at operating frequency than
electromagnetic waves which travel at the speed of light. Therefore, for
a given operating frequency, a SAW filter provides a smaller structure
than a transmission line structure, therefore, making them suitable for
miniaturized radio frequency applications. Furthermore, SAW
structures are easily integratable with other active circuits, such as
amplifiers and mixers, which are produced using conventional
integrated circuit technologies. For the above reasons, the popularity of
SAW structures in radio frequency applications, especially in filter
applications, has been increasing steadily.SAW filters are particularly used in communication devices to
provide selectivity at various stages of a receiver, such as at the front-end
stage or at the IF stage of the receiver. The selectivity of a SAW filter is
determined by its bandwidth which is defined as the frequency spectrum
limited between the 3dB points of the filter's frequency response.When used in the IF stage of the receiver, the bandwidth of the IF
SAW filter is dependent upon the type of modulation used in the receiver.
With recent developments in telecommunication technology,
particularly with the advent of the personal communication systems,
such as cordless telephone second-generation also known as CT2,
European and Japanese digital cordless telephone systems , respectively
known as DECT and JDCT, more complex modulation techniques are
used for communicating messages. These new digital services require
wider bandwidths than usually used on conventional communication 
wider bandwidths than usually used on conventional communication
systems. For example, the CT2 system uses time division duplex (TDD)
with frequency division multiple access (FDMA) technology which supports
digital data rate of 72 kilobits per second per channel with a 32 kilobits
per second adaptive differential pulse code modulated (ADPCM) voice
signal. The CT2 system requires a 100 KHz IF bandwidth for
communicating messages. On the other hand, the European digital
cordless telephone system (DECT) utilize a time division multiple access
(TDMA) system supporting digital data at 1152 kilobits per
