<ABSTRACT>
Exhaust gases containing alkylnitrite are purified in a continuous manner when they are treated with equimolar to excess amidosulphuric acid in the form of an aqueous solution in the manner of a counter-current scrubbing at a temperature of 0-100 DEG C.

<CLAIMS>
Continuous method for the purification of methyl
nitrite-containing exhaust gases, characterized in

that these exhaust gases are treated with equimolar
to excess amidosulphonic acid in the form of an

aqueous solution in the manner of a counter-current
scrubbing at a temperature of 0-100°C and the

exhaust gas streams arising in this are subjected if
necessary to a still further purification.
Method according to 
Claim 1
, characterized in that
the treatment is carried out at a temperature of

10-80°C, preferably 20-60°C.
Method according to 
Claim 1
, characterized in that
the treatment is carried out at a pressure of

0.1-50 bar, preferably 0.5-10 bar.
Method according to 
Claim 1
, characterized in that
the molar ratio of added amidosulphonic acid to the

methyl nitrite is 1:1 to 10:1, preferably 1:1 to
4:1.
Method according to 
Claims 1-4
, characterized in
that the further exhaust gas treatment is the

removal of residual nitrogen oxides, preferably
nitrogen monoxide, by a water scrubbing, in the

absence or presence of aqueous inorganic bases and 
in the absence or presence of oxygen.
Method according to 
Claim 5
, characterized in that
the further exhaust gas treatment is carried out in

the form of a counter-current scrubbing.
Method according to 
Claim 5
, characterized in that
the exhaust gas stream provided for the further

exhaust gas treatment and/or the equipment set-up
provided for the further exhaust gas treatment is

additionally fed with oxygen or oxygen-containing
gas mixtures, preferably with air.
Method according to Claims 1-4, characterized in
that the treatment with amidosulphonic acid and the

further purification are carried out in only one
column and for this purpose oxygen or oxygen-containing

gas is fed to the exhaust gas to be purified
prior to entry into the single counter-current

scrubbing or is fed to the counter-current scrubbing
in the vicinity of the exhaust gas entry simultaneously

with the exhaust gas.
