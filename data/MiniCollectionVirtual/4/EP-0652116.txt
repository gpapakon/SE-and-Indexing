<ABSTRACT>
Vehicle tyre having a single-ply or multi-ply radial carcass, a belt (rigid breaker) and a tread strip. Arranged between the tread strip and the belt there is at least one rubber ply (5), which is reinforced with fibres whose principal direction of orientation coincides with the circumferential direction. The fibres are thermally shrinkable fibres in the form of staple fibres (7).

Vehicle tyre, having a single-ply or 
multiple-ply radial carcase, a tread strip and a belt, 

which is disposed between the radial carcase (1) and the 
tread strip and is provided with, more especially, at 

least 2 belt plies (4a, 4b), having reinforcing members 
formed from steel or a textile material and extending 

parallel to one another in each position, and having at 
least one rubber ply (5) disposed between the tread 

strip and the belt, said rubber ply being reinforced 
with fibres, the main direction of orientation of which 

fibres is identical to the circumferential direction, 
characterised in that the rubber ply or respectively the 

rubber plies (5) is or are produced from a rubber 
mixture and contains or contain 5 to 50 parts by weight, 

relative to 100 parts by weight rubber in the mixture, 
heat-shrinkable fibres in the form of staple fibres (7), 

the length of which fibres is 5 to 50 mm, more 
especially 10 to 30 mm. 
Vehicle tyre according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the p
roportion of staple fibres is 10 to 35 
parts by weight, relative to 100 parts by weight rubber 

in the crude mixture. 
Vehicle tyre according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the rubber ply (plies) (5) 

contains (contain) staple fibres (7) of variable 
lengths. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the ratio of length to width of 

the staple fibres is at least 75.  
 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the heat-shrinkable fibrous 

material is a polyamide, more especially Nylon 6 or 
Nylon 6.6. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the heat-shrinkable fibrous 

material is a polyester, more especially a 
terephthalate. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the staple fibres (7) are chopped 

or cut-up, non-rubberised or rubberised, but 
non-vulcanised cut waste materials. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the thickness of the rubber ply 

(5) is between 0.5 mm and 3.5 mm, more especially 
between 1 mm and 3 mm. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the rubber ply (5) covers the 

lateral edge regions of the belt (4), the proportion of 
staple fibre preferably being higher in these regions 

than in the other rubber ply region. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the staple fibres (7) are 

pretreated in immersion solutions of known type. 
Vehicle tyre according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that additional substances to promote 

the adhesion between rubber and textile are admixed to 
the crude mixture for the rubber ply (5), more  

 
especially phenolic additives, such as, for example, 

resorcinol or resorcinol-containing resins as well as 
methylene donors such as, for example, hexamethylene 

tetramine or hexamethylol melamine.
