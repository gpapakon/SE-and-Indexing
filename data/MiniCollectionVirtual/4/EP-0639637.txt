<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions 
comprising percarbonate bleach particles. In particular it 
relates to compositions which have a high bulk density, 
improved characteristics of dispensing from either the 
drawer of a washing machine, or other dispensing device, 
thereby giving improved cleaning performance of bleaching 
compositions. Perborate bleach has been commonly used in detergent 
compositions. However it has a tendency to promote gelling 
in the presence of surfactants and water which may prevent 
the detergent composition from being rapidly and 
effectively dispersed in the wash solution. Percarbonate bleach is currently being proposed as an 
alternative to perborate bleach which has commonly been  
 
used in detergent compositions in the past. Sodium 
percarbonate is an attractive perhydrate for use in 
detergent compositions because it dissolves readily in 
water, is weight efficient and, after giving up its 
available oxygen, provides a useful source of carbonate 
ions for detergency purposes. Particulate detergent components comprising surfactants and 
percarbonate have been proposed in the prior art. WO92/6163, published on 16th April, 1992, discloses 
granular compositions which comprise percarbonate and 
surfactant particles. It states that a substantial amount 
of the surfactant particles should have a particle size 
lying between 250 micrometers and 700 micrometers. The application, which is mainly concerned with 
percarbonate stability, also mentions the possibility of 
coating percarbonate with protective layer comprising 
carbonate and sulphate. EP510746, published on 28th October, 1992 describes 
surfactant agglomerates having an average particle size of 
from 200 to 1000 micrometers. "Bleaching agents" and 
"perborate" are specifically disclosed as optional 
components, but percarbonate is not mentioned. A disadvantage which may be associated with high density 
surfactant agglomerates is that they have slower rates of 
surfactant dissolution when compared to low density 
products. This can reduce the overall cleaning performance 
because a slow rate of surfactant dissolution causes a slow 
rate of fabric/soil wetting and a slow rate of control of 
fabric softener cationic active residues on fabrics.  A proposed solution is to use more rapidly water soluble 
surfactants having a low Krafft point, and fine surfactant 
agglomerate particle size in order to give more rapid rates 
of surfactant dissolution.
