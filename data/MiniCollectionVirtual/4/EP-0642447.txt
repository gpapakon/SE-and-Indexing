<ABSTRACT>
A beverage frothing device for a beverage container for production of a foamy dispersion of bubbles or "head" within a liquid packaged within sealed, non-resealable cans or other containers. The beverage frothing device has a fluid chamber formed by two generally hollow telescopically slidable members (301, 302) which have means for securing (308, 317) the two members (301, 302) in a telescopically compressed position. Means (314) are also provided for fluid communication between the fluid chamber and the exterior of the device in response to a predetermined reduction in the pressure external to the device. A cage arrangement with a plurality of arms (305) is disposed around the two members (301, 302) such that the arms (305) curve away from the members (301, 302) and exert a force against the insides of the beverage container when the two members (301, 302) are telescopically compressed thereby holding the device in place in the beverage container.

<DESCRIPTION>
BEVERAGE FROTHING DEVICEThis invention relates to a device for generation of a foaming dispersion of bubbles within a liquid packaged within sealed, non-resealable cans or other containers. It is especially although not exclusively suited to use with canned alcoholic beverages such as beer, ale, porter, stout or lager but may also be used with non-alcoholic soft drinks.A device and method for the production of a foamy dispersion of bubbles or "head" is desirable in beverages such as beer, ale, porter, stout or lager since these beverages often lack such a head when sold in canned form. Head generation is assisted by the release of gas dissolved in the beverage when it iÎµ depressurised whether by being drawn from a keg as with draught beverage, or by opening of a can or bottle. In draught beverages this is enhanced by the pressurisation of kegs with carbon dioxide (C02) , nitrogen (N2) or other inert gases, establishing a higher concentration of dissolved gases in draught beverage than in canned beverage. Thus draught beverages usually release more bubbles during depressurisation and have more dense, longer lasting 

heads than canned beverages.Prior art has addressed these problems by various methods.Disclosure has been made of various moulded inserts which are gas filled and discharge their gas through an orifice in the insert upon depressurisation of the can. The energy released from the insert upon depressurisation is highly temperature sensitive causing inconsistent head production at varying temperatures. At room temperature this may result in excessive foaming and loss of beverage.Alternative approaches to the problem include cans modified to comprise one chamber for beverage and one for gas that mix when the can is opened. This sophisticated design of can leads to high costs and could prove unviable.Various intermediate systems exist where gas chambers are incorporated in can lids or bases. In addition chemical methods of inducing a head have been disclosed but it is unclear to what extent these affect the taste of the beverage.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a beverage frothing device for a beverage container, the device having a fluid chamber formed by two generally hollow telescopic slidable members sealably slidable one within the other, wherein means are provided for securing the two members in a telescopically compressed position and means are also provided for causing fluid communication between said fluid chamber and the exterior of the device in

Claims
1. A beverage frothing device for a beverage container, the device having a fluid chamber formed by two generally hollow telescopic members sealably slidable one within the other, wherein means are provided for securing the two members in a telescopically compressed position and means are also provided for causing fluid communication between said fluid chamber and the exterior of the device in response to a predetermined reduction in the pressure external to the device.
2. A beverage frothing device as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the securing means is in the form of a projection member projecting from one of the generally hollow telescopically slidable members and an engagement member attached to the other generally hollow telescopically slidable member for engaging the projection member.
3. A beverage fr hing device as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein the device has means for holding the device inside a beverage container, the holding means exerting a force against the inside of the beverage container as the device is telescopically compressed.
4. A beverage frothing device as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the two telescopic members are compressed to a first position and in this first position the holding means holds the device inside the beverage container and wherein the two telescopic members are further compressed to a second position thereby increasing the fluid pressure in the fluid 


 chamber to a desired level.
5. A beverage frothing device as claimed in Claim 3 or Claim 4, wherein the holding means is in the form of a cage attached to outer ends of the two generally hollow telescopically slidable members, the cage having a plurality of arms which curve away from the two members as the two members are telescopically compressed.
6. A beverage frothing device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein a spacer component is disposed within the fluid chamber in order to regulate the internal volume and thereby the pressure of the fluid chamber.
7. A beverage frothing device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the device contains a non-oxidising gas.
8. A beverage frothing device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the two members are cylinders each having one open end, the open ends being placed together and having closely fitting sealing means.
9. A beverage frothing device as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 8, wherein the fluid communication means is in the form of a piercing means which pierces an aperture in the fluid chamber.
10. A beverage frothing device as claimed in Claim 9, in which the fluid communication means further includes a metering aperture for regulating the fluid emitted from the fluid chamber. 


11. A beverage frothing device as claimed in Claim 10 when dependent on Claim 2, wherein the piercing means is disposed on the engagement member of the securing means and pierces a wall of the projection member, the projection member being hollow and the interior of the projection member communicating with the exterior of the device via the metering aperture.
12.

18. A beverage frothing device as claimed in Claim 17 wherein the projection member is a three detent pin which interengages with an opening in the engagement member which member is in the form of a spider across the open end of one of the generally hollow telescopically slidable members, the detent pin being forced through the opening when the members are compressed.
19. A beverage frothing device as claimed in Claim 18, wherein one of the telescopic members has an aperture initially closed by an O-ring seal in a recess over the aperture, and a wall of the other member replaces the O-ring as the closing means for the aperture as the members are compressed, said wall not covering the aperture when the detent closest to the fixed end of the projection 


 member is above the opening of the spider.
20.
