<ABSTRACT>
In order to fasten a generally cylindrical gas generator cartridge (14) in a housing block (10) of a belt tensioner drive unit, the housing block (10) is provided with a bore (12) into which the gas generator cartridge (14) is pushed. A sleeve (18) is pushed onto the outer end (14a), provided with an electric igniter of the gas generator cartridge, which sleeve exhibits, at its outer end a radially inwardly directed flange (20) which engages over the end surface of the gas generator cartridge (14). At its opposite axial end, the sleeve (20) is provided with radially outwardly directed mouldings (22) which can be introduced through axial guide ducts (12a, 12b) in the bore (12) and, when the sleeve (18) is rotated in a predetermined direction of rotation, engage into a groove (20) which runs in the circumferential direction of the bore and into which the guide ducts (12a, 12b) open.

An apparatus for securing a generally cylindrical gas 
generator cartridge (14) in a belt tensioner drive unit of a 

vehicular restraining system, said gas generator cartridge 
(14) being inserted in a bore (12) in a housing block (10) of 

the drive unit and secured therein and said gas generator 
cartridge (14) being provided with a gas outlet at its inner 

end facing the bottom of the bore and with an igniter at its 
opposite outer end, characterized in that around the outer 

end of the gas generator cartridge (14) a sleeve (18) is 
provided which features at its first axial end a radially 

inwardly oriented flange (20) surrounding the end surface of 
the gas generator cartridge (14) and which is provided at its 

opposite axial end with lands (22) oriented radially 
outwardly which can be inserted into the bore (12) by axial 

guide channels (12a, 12b) and upon rotation of the sleeve 
(18) in a prescribed sense of rotation engage in a groove 

(28) provided circumferentially in the bore, said guide 
channels (12a, 12b) merging in said groove (28). 
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1, characterized in 
that each of said lands (22) describes a helix coaxial to the 

envelope surface of said sleeve, and that said groove (28) 
features, perpendicular to the axis of said bore (12), an 

abutment surface engaging said lands (22) and providing axial 
support therefor. 
An apparatus as set forth in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that said radially inwardly oriented flange (20) is 

provided with at least two openings (30) which are defined in 
the direction of the prescribed sense of rotation by a semi-cylindrically 

shaped surface (30a) and in the opposite 
direction by a ramp surface (30b) sloping upwards from the 

bottom of the opening.
