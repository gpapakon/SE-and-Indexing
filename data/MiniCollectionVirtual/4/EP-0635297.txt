<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layer filter composite for the production of vacuum cleaner filter bags is provided, which includes at least one layer of filter paper (1'') and at least one layer of fine-fibre nonwoven web (2''), at least one layer of fine-fibre nonwoven web (2'') not covering the complete width of the layer of filter paper (1'') joined to it and thus one or two edge strip recesses being formed on at least one layer of filter paper (1'').

Multi-layered filter composite for making vacuum cleaner
filter bags comprising at least one layer of filter paper

and at least one layer of fine-grained fleece,

characterised in that
 the at least one layer of fine-grained
fleece does not cover the full width of the layer

of filter paper bonded to it and does not project beyond
the edges of the filter paper layer, and thus one or two

edge strip recesses are formed on the at least one layer
of filter paper.
Multi-layered filter composite according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 it consists of one layer of filter
paper and one layer of fine-grained fleece.
Multi-layered filter composite according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 the air permeability of the
composite is 45 to 460 l/m
2
.s at 200 Pa negative pressure
(DIN 53887).
Multi-layered filter composite according to one of Claims
1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the mass per unit area of
the at leas
t one layer of filter paper is 30 to 80 g/m
2

(ISO 536).
Multi-layered filter composite according to one of Claims
1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the air permeability of the
at least one layer of filter paper is 80 to 600 l/m
2
.s at
200 Pa negative pressure (DIN 53887).
Multi-layered filter composite according to one of Claims
1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the tensile strength of the 
at least one layer of filter paper is longitudinally 20

to 80 N/15 mm strip width and transversely 15 to 60 N/15
mm strip width (DIN 53112).
Multi-layered filter composite according to one of Claims
1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the at least one layer of
fine-grained fleece has a mass per unit area of 3 to 30

g/m
2
 (ISO 536).
Multi-layered filter composite according to one of Claims
1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the air permeability of the
at least one layer of fine-grained fleece is 100-2,000

l/m
2
.s at 200 Pa negative pressure (DIN 53887).
Multi-layered filter composite according to one of Claims
1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 the average fibre diameter
of the at least one layer of fine-grained fleece ranges

from 0.5 µm to 15 µm.
Multi-layered filter composite according to one of Claims
1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 the at least one layer of
fine-grained fleece is a layer of meltblown fleece.
Multi-layered filter composite according to one of Claims
1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 two or more layers are
glued to one another by adhesive means.
Multi-layered filter composite according to one of Claims
1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 two or more layers are
bonded to one another without adhesive means by heatcalendering

or ultrasound welding. 
Multi-layered filter composite according to one of Claims
1 to 12, 
characterised in that
 the front edges of the at
least one layer of fine-grained fleece are bonded to the

layer beneath as impermeable to air leakage.
