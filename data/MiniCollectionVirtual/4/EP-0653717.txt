<ABSTRACT>
An automatic cash transaction system allowing 
execution of a new transaction using past transaction 

data of the user stored in an external storage medium 
(5). By using the present system, the user can simply 

execute transactions of various kinds in a short time. 
The present system includes a portable external storage 

medium (5) storing contents of past transactions such as 
deposits, transfers and withdrawals, and automatic cash 

transaction device (1) installed in an office. When the 
user has specified a kind of transaction, only 

transaction data of the specified kind are read from the 
external storage device (5) and displayed on a screen 

and a transaction is executed on the basis of specific 
data selected by the user from the transaction data thus 

read. When the user has not specified a kind of 
transaction, all of usable past transaction data are 

read and displayed and a transaction is executed on the 
basis of transaction data selected by the user. If 

usable transaction data are not stored in the external 
storage device (5), the present system has a function 

for allowing the user to modify arbitrary transaction 
data stored in the external storage device (5) and 

execute a transaction on the basis of the modified data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic
cash transaction system, and in particular to an
automatic cash transaction system capable of executing
transactions on the basis of past transaction data of
users.In recent years, a large number of automatic
cash transaction machines (ATM) capable of performing
transactions such as cash dispensing, deposit, and
transfer on the basis of manual operation by customers
have been installed in ATM corners in order to increase
banking convenience.Each automatic cash transaction machine
typically reads out the transaction account of a
customer recorded in a portable external storage medium,
such as a card or a deposit passbook and transmits
transaction data inputted by the user via an interactive
user interface, to a host computer.When necessary transaction data are to be
inputted to an automatic cash transaction machine,
inputting data one by one costs the user hard labor. In
order to facilitate transaction data inputting, an
automatic transfer system using IC cards as described in 
JP-A-61-46585 was provided. In this system, data
inputted by a customer is stored in a storage medium to
use the data in another time. Such data includes an
account number, the amount of moved funds, a branch
office identification number of the counterparty. When
the customer sends funds to the counterparty in another
time, he inserts the storage medium and selects an item
displayed in accordance with the data stored in the
medium. Then, data necessary for the new transaction is
automatically loaded from the media into the ATM,
thereafter the transaction is started.However, the above described conventional
technique relates to a system used exclusively for
transfer transactions. That is, a customer who operates
ATM for transactions other than transfer has to input
necessary data every time. An automatic cash
transaction system facilitating a variety of
transactions is desired. In such a system a variety of
transaction data are stored in an external storage
medium.In that case, there are the following two ways
to display data on the operation panel of the ATM on the
basis of transaction data stored in the medium so as to
allow the customer to search desired data easily and
quickly.One of them is a method of displaying all
transaction data stored in the external storage medium. 
According to this method, all that the user should do is
to select data usable for the current transaction from
the past transaction data. If displays are made in
order of priority, such as in order of
