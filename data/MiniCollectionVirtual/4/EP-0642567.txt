<ABSTRACT>
The selectivity of a midbarrel hydrocracking process for middle distillates is significantly increased by using a catalyst containing a Y zeolite that has been exchanged with rare earth cations. The rare earth-exchanged Y zeolite has a unit cell size below 24.45 angstroms and/or a water vapor sorptive capacity less than 10 weight percent at 25  DEG C and a p/po value of 0.1.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a catalytic hydrocracking process and a 
catalyst for use therein. The invention is particularly concerned with an improved 
process for producing middle distillate products using a catalyst highly selective 
for such products. Petroleum refiners often produce desirable products such as turbine 
fuel, diesel fuel, and other hydrocarbon liquids known as middle distillates as well 
as lower boiling liquids, such as naphtha and gasoline, by hydrocracking a 
hydrocarbon feedstock derived from crude oil. Feedstocks most often subjected 
to hydrocracking are gas oils and heavy gas oils recovered from crude oil by 
distillation. A typical gas oil comprises a substantial proportion of hydrocarbon 
components boiling above about 700° F. (371°C), usually at least about 80 percent by 
weight boiling above 700° F. (371°C). A typical heavy gas oil has a boiling point range 
between about 600° F. (315°C) and 1050° F. (565°C). Hydrocracking is generally accomplished by contacting, in an 
appropriate reaction vessel, the gas oil or other feedstock to be treated with a 
suitable hydrocracking catalyst under conditions of elevated temperature and 
pressure in the presence of hydrogen so as to yield a lower overall average 
boiling point product containing a distribution of hydrocarbon products desired by 
the refiner. Although the operating conditions within a hydrocracking reactor 
have some influence on the yield of the products, the hydrocracking catalyst is the 
prime factor in determining such yields. At the present time, middle distillates 
are not in high demand relative to gasoline in the United States; however, 
marketing surveys indicate that there will be an increased demand for middle 
distillates as the year 2000 approaches. For this reason, refiners have recently 
been focusing on midbarrel hydrocracking catalysts which selectively produce 
middle distillate fractions, such as turbine fuel and diesel fuel, that boil in the 
300° F. (148°C) to 700° F. (371°C) range. The three main catalytic properties by which the performance of a 
midbarrel hydrocracking catalyst is evaluated are activity, selectivity, and stability.  
 
Activity may be determined by comparing the temperature at which various 
catalysts must be utilized under otherwise constant hydrocracking conditions with 
the same feedstock so as to produce a given percentage, normally about 60 
percent, of products boiling below 700° F. (371°C). The lower the activity temperature for 
a given catalyst, the more active such a
