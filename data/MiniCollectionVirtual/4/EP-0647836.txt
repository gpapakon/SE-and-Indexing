<ABSTRACT>
The load-measuring device is provided with a bottom pulley block (4). A measurement pick-up (6) is integrated into the bottom pulley block (4). The energy for operating the measurement pick-up (6) and the load-proportional measurement data determined by the measurement pick-up (6) are transmitted without wires. Light is used as an energy carrier. The transmission of the measurement data is carried out by means of a data light barrier.

<CLAIMS>
Hoist with a lower block (4), in which is integrated a 
measuring sensor (6), 
characterized by the fact that
 energy 
for operation of the measuring sensor (6) and load-proportionate 

measured data determined by the measuring 
sensor (6) are transmitted to and from the lower block (4) 

by wireless means. 
Hoist in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterized by the fact 
that
 the energy for operation of the measuring sensor (6) is 
transmitted from the hoist (2) to the lower block (4). 
Hoist in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterized by the fact 
that
 the energy for operation of the measuring sensor (6) is 
transmitted from a base station to the lower block (4). 
Hoist in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized 
by the fact that
 light is used as source of energy. 
Hoist in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized 
by the fact that
 the energy is obtained from a solar module 
(8) attached to the lower block (4). 
Hoist in accordance with Claim 5, 
characterized by the fact 
that
 the energy collected by the solar module (8) is stored 
in an accumulator. 
Hoist in accordance with one of Claims 4 to 6, 
characterized 
by the fact that
 the intensity of the light is amplified by 
an additional light source (9).  

 
Hoist in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized 
by the fact that
 the measured data are transmitted by 
wireless means in the form of encoded signals to the hoist 

(2), and are displayed. 
Hoist in accordance with one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized 
by the fact that
 the measured data are transmitted by 
wireless means in the form of encoded signals to an 

evaluator remote from the hoist, and are displayed. 
Hoist in accordance with Claim 8 or 9, 
characterized by the 
fact that
 transmission of the measured data is effected by 
means of a data photosensor. 
Hoist in accordance with Claim 8 or 9, 
characterized by the 
fact that
 transmission of the measured data is effected by 
radio.
