<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for blowing conveyor pipelines (3) free are proposed, in which there is no longer any need for an additional blower for blowing the pipeline (3) free, for example during cleaning. For this purpose, the high pressure of the compressor (1), which is available as conveying pressure during the conveyance of bulk materials, is used as a driving pressure for sucking in additional gas, for example air, via an injector (7) while the pipeline (3) is being blown free. The volumetric gas flow available for blowing free thereby becomes greater than the compressed-air flow generated by the compressor (1), the pressure being reduced at the same time.

Method for blowing free conveyor pipes, in particular conveyor pipes (3) for
the pneumatic slow transportation of loose bulk materials, characterised in

that for the blowing the pressure of a compressor (1) is used as swelling
pressure to suction additional air from the environment via an injector (7),

whereby the flow of gas available for blowing is greater than the flow of
compressed air produced by the compressor (1).
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the compressed air is
taken from a compressed air ductwork system instead of from a compressor.
Method according to one of Claims 1-2, characterised in that instead of
compressed air a different gas is used, in particular nitrogen or carbon

dioxide.
Method according to one of Claims 1-3, characterised in that the compressed
air ductwork system is supplied by several compressors which together

produce sufficient compressed air for transportation but not for simultaneous
blowing.
Method according to one of Claims 1-4, characterised in that the transport
pressure is greater than 1.5 bar and the speed when blowing is between 15

and 25 m/s.
Apparatus for performing the method according to one of Claims 1-4,
characterised in that an air volume control unit (2), in particular one or several

Laval nozzles, is connected parallel to an injector (7), and the compressed air
flows via suitable shut-off devices (12) either via the air volume control unit (2)

or the injector (7), so that in the case of flow via the injector an additional
amount of air is suctioned from the environment to increase the flow of air.
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterised in that instead of air a different
gas, in particular nitrogen or carbon dioxide, is used. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 6 - 7, characterised in that with several
conveyor systems the Laval nozzles and injector stations are combined into a

single unit, in which the air or gas is supplied through a joint suction filter.
