<ABSTRACT>
A reclining device with an angular inclination position 
memory mechanism comprises a pair of memory plates pivotally 

mounted on a seat-back side arm and cooperative to each other 
for mechanically memorizing an angular inclination position of 

the arm by engaging one of the memory plates with the arm and 
by engaging the other memory plate with the base plate, a 

spring-loaded sliding-contact member pivotally supported on the 
arm and engageable with the one memory plate, a sector gear 

fixed to the arm, a lock plate meshable with the sector gear for 
preventing rotation of the seat back, and a cam lever 

mechanically linked to the lock plate through a cam contact and 
to a reclining lever. A pivotal member is linked to the cam lever 

so that the lock plate disengages from the sector gear when the 
pivotal member is brought into sliding-contact with the sliding-contact 

member, based on forward inclining motion of the arm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reclining device, and 
specifically to a reclining device with an angular position memory 
mechanism which is optimally applied for a reclining seat back of 
a two-door type vehicle. As is generally known, in two-door type vehicles with a 
front reclining seat, it is advantageous that an angular position 
memory for a reclining seat back is incorporated in the reclining 
device in consideration with easy getting on and out a car. For 
instance, when the seated passenger on the rear seat gets out the 
car, the seat back of the front seat is inclined forwards by pulling 
the reclining seat lever. Thereafter, in the case the vehicle 
passenger seats on the front seat, the seat back of the front seat is 
backwardly inclined again. In this case, the angular position 
memory acts to retain the seat back at the preset angular 
position. Thus, the reclining seat with the angular position 
memory is free from troublesome setting of the seat back to the 
desired angular inclination. On earlier-model vehicles, a reclining 
device with an angular position memory mechanism for a seat 
back and a seat slide are both employed to ensure fore-aft 
angular inclination adjustment of the seat back and fore-aft 
position adjustment of the seat cushion. A reclining device with a 
reclining angular position memory mechanism has been disclosed 
in Japanese Patent Second Publication (Tokko Heisei) No. 4-25803. The previously-noted conventional reclining device with an 
angular position memory is attached onto a base plate on which a 
seat cushion is mounted. The reclining device includes a sector 
gear (upper toothed plate) rotatably received on a main pivot 
shaft rotatably attached onto the base plate. The sector gear is  
 
firmly fixed to a seatback-side arm. The arm is firmly secured to 
the seat back by means of bolts and rotatably received by the 
main pivot shaft of the base plate. The reclining device also 
includes a pivotable lock plate (lower toothed plate) having a 
toothed portion which is brought into meshed contact with the 
sector gear to prevent rotational movement of the sector gear to 
the base plate of the seat cushion so that the seat back is held at a 
desired angular position. A reclining-seat operating lever is 
provided to cause pivotal movement of the lock plate. 
Additionally, the reclining device includes an angular position 
memory mechanism which will be hereinafter abbreviated as 
only a memory. The memory comprises a spring-loaded memory 
lever which has a
