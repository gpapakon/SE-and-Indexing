<ABSTRACT>
A high molecular weight sheet comprising a composite whose 
principal component is a special water soluble high molecular 

weight compound, or a multilayer sheet wherein a water soluble 
high molecular weight layer is piled on sheet material is 

prepared. Then, said sheet is layered on entry side of a 
laminated substrate comprising insulating material and metallic 

foil. In this state, through holes are formed in the laminated 
substrate through said sheet. When forming through holes, said 

water soluble high molecular weight compound serves as lubricant 
so as to extend drill life. In addition, it is possible to drill 

a lot of substrates, which are layered, at one time, resulting in 
the improvement of production efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for drilling
thru-holes in a lamination substrate such as a multilayer
printed circuit board panel.When forming thru-holes in an electronic lamination
substrate such as a multilayer printed circuit board panel,
metallic foil is usually placed on the above circuit board
panel (sometimes referred to as the panel hereinafter) and
then thru-holes are formed with a gimlet, a drill, a puncher
or the like. There are problems that resultant debris sticks
to the panel surface, the thru-hole walls or the edges
surrounding the thru-holes during the method of forming thru-holes.
Furthermore, there is another problem that the thru-hole
wall forms into a rough surface. Therefore, such debris
must be forcefully removed by installing a suction device
additionally, or debris stuck to neighboring portion of formed
thru-holes must be removed by grinding cut surface in
conventional methods. However, it is not preferable to add
these processes like sucking debris or grinding, which make
the working process complicated.To simplify such a process, there are methods that a 
sheet impregnated with a water soluble lubricant is placed on
one side or both sides of the above lamination substrate, in
which metallic foil is layered on an insulating material, and
then thru-holes are drilled through this sheet by a drill or
the like, in the lamination substrate (Unites States Patent
No. 4,781,495 and United States Patent No. 4,929,370). That
is, the mixture, solid water soluble lubricant, comprising
glycols such as diethylene glycol or dipropylene glycol, ester
synthetic wax such as fatty acid, and a non-ionic surfactant
is impregnated into a sheet such as paper, which is employed
for drilling in the above method. Further, besides this
method, there are methods of drilling thru-holes in a
lamination substrate through a sheet wherein a high molecular
layer is formed with water soluble high molecular of
polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol solely, or water
soluble high molecular mixture thereof, or fatty acid ester
thereof, or the like (Tokkaihei 4-92488, Tokkaihei 4-92489,
Tokkaihei 4-92490, Tokkaihei 4-92491, Tokkaihei 4-92492,
Tokkaihei 4-92493, and Tokkaihei 4-92494).However, the above methods have various defects. For
example, when forming thru-holes, heat removal effect on a
drill bit is not sufficient, stickiness occurs, lubricating
effect cannot be obtained because water soluble high molecular
is too hard to melt, or water soluble high molecular cannot
be easily formed into a sheet
