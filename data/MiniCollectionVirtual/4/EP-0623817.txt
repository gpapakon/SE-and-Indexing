<ABSTRACT>
The field of view to a local portion of a specimen (2) irradiated by 
X-rays from an 

X-ray tube (1) is restricted with a view-restricting diaphragm (3). The 
fluorescent 

X-rays from the specimen passing through the view-restricting diaphragm 
are collimated by a primary Soller slit (4). A control unit (13) rotates 

the specimen at an arbitrary angle around the rotation center by 
controlling 

the rotation mechanism (10) and moves the view-restricting diaphragm 
through an arbitrary distance within a predetermined range in a direction 

perpendicular to the optical axis of said primary Soller slit (4) 

and along a radial direction around the rotation center of said 
specimen (2), 

thereby rotating the specimen at the arbitrary angle and moving the 
view-restricting 

diaphragm through the arbitrary distance so that the view-restricting 
diaphragm may face the local portion of the specimen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an X-ray
fluorescence spectrometer based on a beam-collimating
method and, more particularly to an X-ray
fluorescence spectrometer suitable for use
with local analysis of a specimen.As explained with reference to FIG. 10, in an
X-ray fluorescence spectrometer based on a beam-collimating
method, a specimen 2 is housed in a
specimen container 8. At the center position of
the specimen container 8, only a local portion,
which is a specially selected part out of the
whole surface of the specimen 2 for local
analysis, is exteriorly exposed from the specimen
container 8.The primary X-rays from an X-ray tube 1
irradiates the specimen 2, housed as mentioned
above in the specimen container 8, with the local
portion thereof exposed at the center position of
the specimen container 8. The specimen 2
generates fluorescent X-rays from the local
portion in response to the irradiation of the
primary X-rays from the X-ray tube 1. The
fluorescent X-rays, generated from the local
portion of the specimen 2, are guided through a
view-restricting diaphragm 3 to a primary Soller
slit 4. The primary Soller slit 4 collimates the
fluorescent X-rays guided through the view-restricting
diaphragm 3 and then guides the same 
to a plate analyzing crystal 5.The plate analyzing crystal 5 disperses the
fluorescent X-rays guided from the primary Soller
slit 4 into spectrum having the components of
wavelength corresponding to each of the elements
contained in the specimen 2 and thereafter leads
them into a secondary Soller slit 6. The
secondary Soller slit 6 collimates the dispersed
fluorescent X-rays from the plate analyzing
crystal 5 and thereafter leads them to an X-ray
detector 7. The X-ray detector 7 detects each of
the elements contained in the local portion of the
specimen 2 based on the dispersed fluorescent X-rays
having the components of wavelength
corresponding to each of the elements guided.With the above arrangement, it is difficult to
irradiate only the specimen 2 with the primary X-rays
from the X-ray tube 1; therefore part of the
primary X-rays may irradiate the specimen
container 8. As a result, such irradiation of the
primary X-rays causes not only the generation of
fluorescent X-rays from the the local portion of
the specimen 2 but also the generation of
fluorescent X-rays and scattered X-rays from the
specimen container 8.When the fluorescent X-rays and scattered X-rays,
generated from the specimen container 8
other than the local portion to be analyzed, are
incident through the
