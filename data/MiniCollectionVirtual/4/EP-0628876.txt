<ABSTRACT>
Acid sensitive polymeric compositions, and improved 
chemically amplified microlithographic resist compositions 

comprising the acid sensitive polymeric compositions, and 
methods for the preparation and use thereof are disclosed. 

The compositions comprise, in admixture, a polymeric binder, 
an acid labile moiety which provides selective aqueous base 

solubility upon cleavage, and a compound that generates acid 
upon exposure of the resist composition to imaging radiation. 

More particularly, the compositions have one or more acid 
labile ketal groups, which may be chemically linked to a 

polymeric resin or which may be incorporated into a separate 
component to form a dissolution inhibitor. The compositions 

exhibit reduced sensitivity to environmental contaminants 
when compared to known acid amplified resist compositions, 

and may optionally be processed without a post exposure bake 
step. Such compositions are especially useful in the 

fabrication of integrated circuit devices by 
microlithographic techniques.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides improved chemically 
amplified microlithographic resist compositions, polymeric 
components which are useful therein, and methods for the 
preparation and use thereof. The compositions comprise, in 
admixture, a compound that generates acid upon exposure of 
the resist composition to imaging radiation, a polymeric 
binder, and, either in admixture with the binder or 
chemically linked thereto, an acid labile moiety which 
provides selective aqueous base solubility of the mixture 
upon cleavage. The invention is particularly related to 
compositions having an acid labile moiety comprising a ketal 
functional group. Such compositions are especially useful in 
the fabrication of integrated circuit devices by 
microlithographic techniques. In the fabrication of high density integrated circuits 
having sub micron dimensions, the coating, exposure, and 
development of a photoresist layer are particularly critical 
processing steps, and must be accomplished within close 
processing tolerances. For example, it is important to 
control the linewidth of the imaged and developed photoresist 
so that any deviation from the nominal design linewidth is 
small, typically less than ±10%. The profiles of the imaged 
and developed photoresist structures must be straight with 
vertical sidewalls. Photospeed must be such that the 
required exposure dose is less than about 100 mJ/cm² and 
preferably less than about 25 mJ/cm². Moreover, and in part 
because the exposure of individual substrates is typically 
accomplished in a serial manner, whereas development is 
typically accomplished in a batch manner, it is desirable to  
 
use photoresists which are tolerant of a variable time delay 
between the exposure and development steps, and also between 
each of any intervening steps. In sub micron lithography, 
the use of acid amplified resists has become favored due to 
the high photospeed of such compositions. The use of acid amplified resist compositions is well 
known in the art. Such resist compositions are especially 
useful in conjunction with deep UV (180-300 nm), e-beam, and 
X-ray exposure tools, in light of their high photospeed 
characteristics. The following references illustrate the 
state of the pertinent art. U.S. Pat. No. 3,779,778 to Smith, et al., discloses 
photosolubilizable compositions comprising a water insoluble 
compound having acid labile groups and a photosensitive acid 
progenitor. Acid labile groups which are disclosed include 
acetal groups. U.S. Pat. No. 4,491,628 to
