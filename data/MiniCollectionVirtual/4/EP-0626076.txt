<ABSTRACT>
An X-ray sensitive composition including one or several photopolymerizable monomer or photocrosslinkable polymer systems and thermochromic substances which can be used in a dry X-ray reproduction process. The process is based on the different dielectric constants and dielectric losses exhibited by a monomer and the corresponding polymer or a polymer and the crosslinked polymer and the reaction of certain thermochromic substances which exhibits a specific threshold temperature above which these substances change from a colorless form to a color stable form. The X-ray sensitive element (5) is exposed according to a pattern of X-ray with spatial modulation providing an X-ray image (2) to form a latent image of polymerized or crosslinked zones and unpolymerized or non crosslinked zones. Exposed elements (8) are developed by passing through a high frequency electrical field which raises the temperature of the polymerized or crosslinked zones by dielectric heating to above the color threshold temperature of the thermochromic substance. An apparatus for carrying out the process is also described.

 DESCRIPTION NEW NONSI VER X-RAY RECORDING PROCESS5 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the InventionThe invention relates to an X-Ray composition and an 10 X-Ray sensitive element useful in a novel X-Ray recording process. AN apparatus particularly suited to practicing the X-Ray recording process is also disclosed.Description of Related Art15Most X-Ray recording processes that allow production of a permanent recording are based on photochemical reactions and require use of liquid chemical agents to develop and fix the image. This is the case in20 conventional silver-based processes in which silver halide is used as the X-Ray sensitive compound. Storage, handling and disposal of the required solutions entail safety precautions because of possible toxicity to humans and to the environment.25Other disadvantages are associated with liquid developers and fixers. As with any liquid, attention must be paid to containers, the need to be renewed at regular time intervals and, above all, protection of the30 immediate environment from spills and subsequent exposure.There are X-Ray recording processes that do not use silver, namely processes that are based on xerography. br 35 However, these processes are considerably less sensitive than silver halide. Bulky equipment is required for 

develop ent and the toners used may contain selenium and are quite toxic.A nonsilver X-Ray recording process is described in U.S. Patent 4,394,439. The process is based on the generation of free radicals resulting from photodegradation of certain polymeric materials exposed to X-Rays and a dye forming reaction initiated by the free radicals. Disadvantages of this process are low sensitivity and the requirement for chemical fixing.U.S. Patent No. 4,699,872 also relates to a nonsilver recording process. This process is based on the sensitivity of choline chloride to high energy radiations, including X-Rays. Products of the. photodissociation of choline chloride generate a dye which is responsible of the image. An undesirable feature of this process is the unpleasant odor generated during heat development of the image. An even more serious disadvantage is the lack of emulsion stability.It can be seen that most of the existing processes for the recording of X-Ray images suffer from some disadvantage. Some of these are overcome by using nonconventional processes that do not employ silver solutions; however many nonsilver processes have low sensitivity, instability or unacceptable odor.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention
