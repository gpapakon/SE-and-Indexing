<ABSTRACT>
A domestic refrigerator or freezer consists of a heat-insulating housing which encloses a cooling space and which can be closed at its open front side by a door, and of a cooling air duct which is formed between the rear wall (6) of the cooling space (3) and an intermediate wall (7) arranged in front of this and into which an air stream (B) is blown by a blower (4) for circulating the cooling air. In order to make possible a more simple construction with an improved efficiency, the intermediate wall (7) is formed by a plate-shaped evaporator which is provided with passage gaps (8) for distributing the cooling air.

Domestic refrigerator or freezer

having a thermally insulated housing that encloses a
cooling space and can be closed at its open front side by

a door, and
having a cooling-air channel (5) which is formed between
the rear wall (6) of the cooling space and an intermediate

wall arranged in front of the said rear wall (6),
and into which an air stream is blown by a blower (4) in

order to circulate the cooling air, the air stream
flowing around a plate-shaped evaporator (7) that is

provided with passage slots (8),

characterized in that

the intermediate wall is formed by the plate-shaped
evaporator.
