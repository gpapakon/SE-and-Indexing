<ABSTRACT>
In order to simplify the design of a high-pressure cleaning device with an electric motor (2), a pump (3) driven thereby for a liquid cleaning agent, a closed housing (1) surrounding the electric motor (2), a blower (23) driven by the electric motor (2) and generating a gas flow circulating in the housing for cooling the motor (1) and a cooler fitted in the housing for the gas flow through which the cleaning agent flows, it is proposed that the pump (3) is fitted at least partially in the housing (1) and is in heat-transmission contact with the gas flow in the housing (1).

High-pressure cleaning device with an electric motor (2), a 
pump (3) driven thereby for a liquid cleaning agent, a 

closed housing (1) surrounding the electric motor (2), a 
blower (23) driven by the electric motor (2) and generating 

a stream of gas circulating in the housing (1) and cooling 
the electric motor (2) and a cooler for the gas stream, said 

cooler being arranged in the housing (1) and having the 
cleaning agent flowing through it, characterized in that the 

pump (3) is arranged at least partially in the housing (1), 
is in heat transfer contact with the gas stream in the 

housing (1) and thereby forms the cooler. 
High-pressure cleaning device as defined in claim 1, 
characterized in that the pump (3) is arranged completely in 

the interior of the housing (1) and has the gas stream 
flowing around it. 
High-pressure cleaning device as defined in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the supply lines (9) and/or discharge 

lines (11) of the pump (3) in the interior of the housing 
(1) have the gas stream flowing around them. 
High-pressure cleaning device as defined in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the electric motor 

(2) and the pump (3) form a constructional unit.  
 
High-pressure cleaning device as defined in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a gearing (21) is 

inserted between electric motor (2) and pump (3). 
High-pressure cleaning device as defined in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the supply lines (9) 

and discharge lines (11) of the pump (3) are guided through 
the housing wall in a sealed manner. 
High-pressure cleaning device as defined in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the housing (1) 

bears cooling ribs (24) on its outer side. 
High-pressure cleaning device as defined in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the housing (1) 

bears cooling ribs (25) on its inner side. 
High-pressure cleaning device as defined in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the pump (3) bears 

cooling ribs on its outer side.
