<ABSTRACT>
Clocked converter with current limiting, with a current sensor arranged in the main circuit and with a comparator, with the aid of which it is possible to trigger limiting of the current flowing in the main circuit. In order to obtain a fold-back current/voltage characteristic in the event of an overcurrent on the output side, a current source which is controlled as a function of the output voltage and has resistance causes the voltage across the actual value input of the comparator to rise as the output voltage increases. The clocked converter can be used advantageous for feeding devices employed in electrical telecommunications (message transmission) technology.

Clocked converter with current limiting, having
an electronic switch (3), which is arranged in the main

circuit, is connected by its control input to a control
output (97) of a control circuit (21), which control
