<ABSTRACT>
A process serves for composting a mixture of organic substances and interfering substances, in particular for composting organic wastes. In order to utilise the organic substances present in the mixture particularly effectively, the organic substances are biodegraded in a closed vessel with forced aeration. The raw compost resulting from this is fed to a sink-float separator (4, 5, 6), in which the interfering substances sink. The substances not sinking in the sink-float separator (4, 5, 6) are again biodegraded in a closed vessel with forced aeration.

Process for composting a mixture of organic
substances and interfering substances, in particular for

composting organic wastes,

in which the organic substances are biodegraded in a
closed vessel with forced ventilation (intensive

rotting),
in which the crude compost formed during the intensive
rotting, prior to the total decomposition of the readily

decomposable organic substance, is subjected to a screening
operation,
in which the screen overflow formed during this operation
is fed to a sedimentation separator, in which the interfering

substances sink,
in which the substances which do not sink in the sedimentation
separator are mixed with the screen underflow
and in which the mixture is then again biodegraded in a
closed vessel with forced ventilation.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the crude compost is comminuted.
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that condensate from the decomposition

process is used as flotation water for the sedimentation
separator.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that air is injected into the flotation

water of the sedimentation separator.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the flotation water of the sedimentation

separator is treated to make plant water. 
Device for carrying out the process according to
one of the preceding claims, comprising


a closed vessel with a device for forced ventilation,
a screening line (2),
an adjoining sedimentation separator (4, 5, 6), to which
the overflow from the screening line (2) can be fed,
and a mixer (9), to which the substances which do not
sink in the sedimentation separator (4, 5, 6) and the

underflow from the screening line (2) can be fed.
Device according to Claim 6, characterized by a
comminution unit (1).
