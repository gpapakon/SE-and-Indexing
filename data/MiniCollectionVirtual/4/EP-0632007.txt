<ABSTRACT>
A process by which iodine compounds contained in 
crude acetic anhydride or a mixture of crude acetic 

anhydride and crude acetic acid can be converted into 
methyl iodide having a low boiling point and separable 

by distillation and efficiently removed by the 
combination of the conversion step with the heat 

treatment step and distillation step, which comprise 
the steps of heat-treating the crude acetic anhydride 

or the mixture of crude acetic anhydride and crude 
acetic acid in the presence of methanol and/or methyl 

acetate in a treatment tank and distilling the heat-treated 
crude acetic anhydride or the heat-treated 

mixture of crude acetic anhydride and crude acetic 
acid, in the presence of an alkali metal salt and/or 

an alkaline earth metal salt if necessary.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
removing iodine compounds from crude acetic anhydride
or a mixture of crude acetic anhydride and crude
acetic acid, i.e., a carbonylation reaction product.Acetic anhydride is used on a large scale as a
starting material for cellulose acetate, and it is
useful also as a starting material for chemicals such
as medicines, perfumes and dyes. Acetic acid which is
also used on a large scale as a starting material for
acetic esters, acetic anhydride, vinyl acetate and
terephthalic acid is a fundamental compound
necessitated in the polymer industry, the chemical
industry and many other industries.Acetic anhydride was produced from a ketene
obtained by thermal decomposition of acetic acid in
the prior art. Recently, a process for producing
acetic anhydride from methyl acetate or dimethyl
ether, and carbon monoxide has been developed. This 
process comprises conducting a catalytic reaction in
the presence of a rhodium compound and methyl iodide
as the main catalysts. Various cocatalysts have been
proposed, however, since the reaction velocity is low
when only the main catalysts are used. The function
required of the cocatalyst is to accelerate the
reaction of methyl acetate or dimethyl ether with
carbon monoxide to an industrially acceptable extent.
It is also required of the cocatalyst to exhibit a
remarkable acceleration effect in as small as possible
amount. When no cocatalyst is used, the reaction
velocity does not depend on the concentration of the
rhodium compound and methyl iodide used as the main
catalysts but it heavily depends on the concentration
of methyl acetate. Thus, the productivity of the
reaction is very poor. On the other hand, when the
cocatalyst is used, the dependence of the reaction
velocity on the concentration of methyl acetate is
reduced and the reaction velocity comes to depend on
the concentration of the rhodium compound and methyl
iodide used as the main catalysts.As the reaction promoters, various cocatalysts
are proposed such as iodides of quaternized amine
compounds and phosphine compounds, lithium compounds
such as lithium iodide and lithium acetate and Lewis 
acidic compounds such as aluminum compounds and
chromium compounds. Among these cocatalysts, the
iodides of quaternized amine compounds and phosphine
compounds have a relatively poor reaction-promoting
effect and, therefore, they must be used in a large
amount. Lithium compounds such as lithium iodide and
lithium acetate must be used also in an amount of as
large as 30 to 50 mol

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing acetic anhydride or a mixture of
acetic anhydride and acetic acid and for removing iodine

compounds therefrom wherein crude acetic acid anhydride or a
mixture of crude acetic anhydride and crude acetic acid is

formed by reacting dimethyl ether and/or methyl acetate, and
optionally water and/or methanol, with carbon monoxide in the

presence or absence of hydrogen in the presence of a rhodium
compound as a catalyst and methyl iodide as a cocatalyst and

an iodide as a reaction promoter, which comprises the steps
of heat-treating the crude acetic anhydride or the mixture of

crude acetic anhydride and crude acetic acid in the presence
of methanol and/or methyl acetate in a treatment tank at 110

to 200Â°C for 5 to 60 minutes, wherein the amount of methanol
and/or methyl acetate is 1 to 1000 mol per mol of the iodine

compound to be treated and distilling the heat-treated crude
acetic anhydride or the heat-treated mixture of crude acetic

anhydride and crude acetic acid.
The method of claim 1, wherein the crude acetic anhydride or
the mixture of crude acetic anhydride and crude acetic acid

to be heat-treated is obtained by taking a crude reaction
liquid out of the reactor, subjecting the crude reaction

liquid to flash evaporation to give a vapor comprising acetic
anhydride and acetic acid, introducing the vapor into a

distillation column, and taking out the crude acetic
anhydride or the mixture of crude acetic anhydride and 
crude
acetic acid through a side cut near the bottom of the

distillation column. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the distillation is effected
in the presence of an alkali metal salt and/or an alkaline

earth metal salt, wherein the amount of the alkali or
alkaline earth metal salt is 1 to 10 mol per mole of the

remaining iodine compound.
The method of claim 1, which further comprises the step of
distilling the crude acetic anhydride or the mixture of crude

acetic anhydride and crude acetic acid before the heat-treatment.
