<ABSTRACT>
A stencil printing apparatus including a main body (1), a drum unit (11)
having a drum substantially in a cylindrical shape and attachable and detachable

to and from the main body (1), drum detecting means (4) for detecting the
identity of the drum unit (11) mounted to the main body (1) and control means

(3) for carrying out an auto idling operation prior to a successive perforating
operation in a case in correspondence with at least either of when a non-operational

time period of the main body (1) exceeds a previously set time
period and when the drum detecting means (4) detects interchanging of the

drum unit (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stencil printing
apparatus for carrying out printing by using stencil sheet,
particularly to a stencil printing apparatus capable of
immediately carrying out normal printing even when the
apparatus has been left to a nonprinting state for a long period of
time.In the printing operation of a stencil printing apparatus,
stencil sheet perforated by a perforating section is made to wrap
a drum and thereafter, a sheet supply section supplies print
sheet to the drum. A press roller presses print sheet to the
drum to thereby carry out the printing and printed sheet is
discharged to a sheet discharging section.According to such a stencil printing apparatus, when the
apparatus is left without carrying out the printing operation for
a long period of time, ink at inside of the drum or on the surface
of the drum is dried or deteriorated. Thereby, when the printing
operation is newly started after the apparatus has been left to
the nonprinting state, there poses a problem in which image blur
of print sheet or a dispersion in print darkness is caused and a
number of sheets of incomplete printed matter referred to as
"failure printed matter" are discharged during a time period
until normal printing is carried out in which a total of image is 
uniformly printed on the print sheet. The problem gives rise to
increase in the printing cost and the printing time.In order to resolve the above-described problem,
according to an apparatus disclosed in Japanese Unexamined
Patent Publication No. 3-175081, there is provided a mode
referred to as "automatic idling mode".According to the mode, a time point at which the
perforating operation and printing operation has finally been
carried out is memorized to the apparatus and successively, a
time interval between the memorized time point and a current
time point is calculated in a successive perforating operation.
When the calculated non-operational time period is equal to or
more than a set value of the automatic idling mode,
nonperforated master sheet is made to wrap the drum, a
pressing operation the same as that in printing is carried out
without supplying sheet by which the ink is made adaptable.According to the above-described constitution, when one
drum unit is used for one apparatus, the function is sufficiently
achieved and the failure printed matter can be prevented from
causing. However, when a plurality of drums are used for one
machine, although the automatic idling mode is operated for a
drum unit which is initially used, when the

a main body;
a drum unit having a drum substantially in a cylindrical
shape and attachable and detachable to and from the main body;
storing means for storing time at which the drum unit is
finally used; and
control means for carrying out an automatic idling
operation prior to a successive perforating operation when a

non-operational time period of the drum unit which is calculated
from time stored to the storing means and current time exceeds a

previously set time period.
The stencil printing apparatus according to any one of
Claims 1 through 4:
