<ABSTRACT>
A solvent-based facade (facing, masonry) stripping agent (stripper) comprises one or more organic solvents which are free of chlorine and have a solubility in water of less than 0.5 % by weight, and also wetting agents, emulsifiers, thickeners and other conventional additives. The stripper is particularly suitable for removing the coating of facades.
