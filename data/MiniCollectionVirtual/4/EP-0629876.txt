<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for generating a succession of MR images, in which, in the presence of a stationary magnetic field, sequences having at least one high-frequency pulse and a magnetic gradient field varying from sequence to sequence act continuously on the examination region and MR images are reconstructed from the MR signals generated thereby, the oldest MR signals employed to reconstruct an MR image being replaced during reconstruction of the subsequent MR image by the newly generated MR signals in each case. In this case a substantially artefact-free representation of dynamic processes in the examination region can be achieved by altering the direction of the magnetic gradient field effective during the generation of a MR signal from sequence to sequence in such a way that the area with the directions of the magnetic gradient field necessary for the reconstruction is uniformly distributed over the newly produced MR signals in each case. The invention also relates to an arrangement for carrying out this method.

A method of forming a series of MR images, in which sequences with at least one
RF pulse and a magnetic gradient field which varies from one sequence to another act

continuously on the examination zone in the presence of a steady magnetic field, MR
images being reconstructed from the MR signals thus generated, the oldest MR signals

(S
111
 ... S
114
) used for the reconstruction of an MR image being replaced by the respective
newly generated MR signals (S
211
 ... S
214
) for the reconstruction of the next MR image,
their number (n) being small in comparison with the number (N) of MR signals required for

the reconstruction of a complete image,
characterized in that
 the direction (4) of the magnetic gradient field (G
x
, G
y
) active during
the formation of an MR signal is varied from one sequence to another so that the directions

of the gradient field for the respective newly generated MR signals are uniformly
distributed across the range (0...ϕ
max
) of the directions of the magnetic gradient field
required for the reconstruction.
A device for carrying out the method claimed in Claim 1, including

a) a magnet (1) for generating a uniform, steady magnetic field,
b) an RF coil system (11) for generating RF pulses,
c) a gradient coil system (3, 5, 7) for generating magnetic gradient fields with a variable
gradient direction,
d) means for generating MR sequences with at least one RF pulse and a direction of the
gradient field, active upon reception of the MR signals, which is varied from one

sequence to another,
e) means (20, 21) for acquiring the MR signals generated by the sequences,
f) means (22-25) for the reconstruction of MR images from the MR signals, as well as
g) control unit (19) which controls said means in such a manner that, after the reception of
a number of MR signals whose number (n) is small in comparison with the number (N)

of MR signals required for the reconstruction of a complete image, an updated MR
image is reconstructed, the oldest MR signals (S
111
...S
114
) used for the reconstruction of 
an MR image being replaced by the respective newly generated MR signals (S
211
 ...S
214
)
for the reconstruction of the next MR image, the direction (4) of the magnetic gradient

field (G
x
, G
y
) active during the formation of an MR signal being varied from one
sequence to another so that the directions of the gradient field for the respective newly

generated MR signals are uniformly distributed across the range (0...ϕ
max
) of the
directions of the magnetic gradient field required for the reconstruction.
A device as claimed in Claim 2,
characterized in that
 it comprises means (28) for entering the number (n) of updated MR
signals each time used to generate an updated MR image.
A device as claimed in Claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that
 it comprises means for synchronizing the sequences with the ECG of a
patient arranged in the examination zone.
