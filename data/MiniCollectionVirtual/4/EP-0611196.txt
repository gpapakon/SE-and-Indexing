<ABSTRACT>
Ammunition for cannons, mortars and similar weapons which are equipped with a recoil damping system, of the type including a cartridge containing a projectile, characterised in that it includes at least two propulsive charges:     - a charge (4) for ejecting the projectile (2); - at least one charge (10) for launching the projectile, this charge being initiated by the hot pressurised gases which originate from the complete combustion of the first charge and are released through a system of successive ignition chambers (7, 13, 14) on passage of the projectile.

<CLAIMS>
Munition for guns, mortars and similar weapons 
equipped with a recoil damping system, of the type 

comprising a casing containing a projectile, which 
comprises: 


at least two coaxial propulsive charges; 

an ejection charge (4) for the projectile (2), 
at least one launching charge (10) for the 
projectile, this charge being initiated by the 

hot pressurized gases resulting from the complete 
combustion of the ejection charge (4); 
a system of chambers, through which are released, 
as the projectile passes, the combustion gases from 

said ejection charge, this system comprising: 

a first chamber (7) receiving the combustion 
gases from the ejection charge (4) and 

operating at high pressure, 
a second, annular chamber (13) or intermediate 
ignition chamber receiving the combustion gases 

from the launching charge (10) of the projectile 
and; 
a third chamber (14) or principal combustion and 
expansion chamber for the munition, operating 

under a lower pressure than that existing in said 
first chamber (7), into which said second chamber 

leads, characterized in that 
the ejection charge (4) is positioned in a sleeve 
(6) integral with the casing (1) containing the 

projectile and leading into said first chamber (7); 
the launching charge (10) is placed at the end of 
said sleeve, in a structure concentric to this 

sleeve and outside it, this structure leading into 
said second chamber (13), the latter being 

inscribed between the internal diameter of the tail 
of the projectile and the external diameter of the 

structure of the launching charge (10). 
Munition according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the structure containing the launching charge (10) 

comprises peripheral ignition apertures (11) 
obturated by an ignition composition and this 

structure is provided with a perforated obturation 
element (12), the nozzles of which ensure the 

ejection of the combustion gases from this launching 
charge. 
Munition according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the munition contains a 

cruising propulsion system (8) or a trail 
compensator, initiated by the combustion gases of the 

ejection charge (4) filling said first chamber (7).
