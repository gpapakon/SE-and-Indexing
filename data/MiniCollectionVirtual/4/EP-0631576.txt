<DESCRIPTION>
 D1pept1dy1qu1nazolones as anti-cancer agentsThis invention relates to novel anti-cancer agents and more particularly it relates to quinazoline derivatives which possess anti-cancer activity.One group of anti-cancer agents comprises antimetabolites05 having anti-folate activity, such as aminopterin and methotrexate. A newer compound of this type which showed considerable promise in clinical trials is known as CB3717 and is described and claimed in United Kingdom Patent No. 2 065 653B. Despite its promising activity against human breast, ovarian and liver cancer, however,10 CB3717 shows symptoms of toxicity in humans, particularly in relation to the liver and kidneys. Such adverse side effects are reduced in compounds in which the 2-amino substituent of CB3717 is either missing or is replaced by one of various alternative substituents as described and claimed respectively in United15 Kingdom Patents Nos. 2 175 903 and 2 188 319.Compounds of this type are believed to act as anti-cancer agents by inhibiting the enzyme thymidylate synthase which catalyses the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate to produce thymidine monophosphate which is required for DNA synthesis. The anti-cancer20. activity of CB3717 and like compounds may be assessed in vitro by determining their inhibitory effect on that enzyme, and in cell cultures by their inhibitory effect on cancer cell lines such as the mouse lymphoma cell line L1210 and the human breast cancer cell line CF-7.25 Antimetabolites such as -aminopterin and methotrexate which are inhibitors of enzymes which utilise folic acid derivatives have also shown promise in the treatment of various allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.We have now found that certain quinazoline derivatives not only30 show a good level of activity, in particular in respect of their ability to inhibit thymidylate synthase, but also have a different mode of action from CB3717 and other related quinazoline derivatives which have been described. Thus it is believed that CB3717 and more 

particularly its 2-methyl analogue, which is described and claimed in UK Patent No. 2 188 3 9, owe anti-tumour activity to an intracellular polyglutamate form but that the compounds of the present invention act directly without undergoing a significant degree of gamma-glutamylation. This alternative mode of action of the compounds of the present invention provides the potential for more precise control in the administration of the compounds to cancer patients, deriving
