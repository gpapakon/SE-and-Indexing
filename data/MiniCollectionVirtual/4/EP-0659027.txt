<ABSTRACT>
In a selectively called radio receiver operable in 
a battery saving method in which frame synchronism is established 

after establishment of bit synchronism and in which a bit rate 
detection signal is produced by detecting (23) a bit rate of an arriving 

radio signal to establish the frame synchronism before lapse 
of a frame synchronism establishing interval after restoration 

or establishment of the bit synchronism subjected to a failure 
in its establishment, repeated production of the bit rate detection 

signal at a regular interval is monitored (15) by determining for 
the regular interval a unit time interval shorter than a frame 

period of the radio signal. Preferably, the unit time interval 
is equal to a four-codeword length of codewords, such as sixteen 

in a typical frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a battery saving method for
a selectively called radio receiver and to a selectively called
radio receiver operable with battery saving.For a selectively called radio receiver with a battery
included, various manners of battery saving are in practical
use. In general, each of such selectively called radio receivers
is rendered alive or put in an active state as an active receiver
with the battery switched on and is primarily intermittently
activated to achieve the battery saving. Towards such active
receivers, a base station transmits a radio signal carrying a
preamble and, in successive frame periods, information signals
collectively as a transmission signal of a bit or baud rate.
Each active receiver begins to receive the radio signal as a
reception signal while intermittently activated. Towards the
base station, the selectively called radio receiver can send
as a selectively calling radio receiver a radio signal which
may have a different bit rate.It will be presumed like in a format specified by the
British Post Office Code Standardisation Advisory Group (BOCSAG)
that the radio signal for transmission as the transmitted signal
comprises in each frame period a frame synchronization signal
and first or primary through N-th or N-ary codewords, where N 
represents a predetermined integer, such as sixteen. Each of
the frame synchronization signals and the codewords in the frame
periods consists of a predetermined number of binary bits, such
as thirty-two bits. For each frame period as herein called,
a combination of the frame synchronization signal and the first
through the N-th codewords is called a batch in the art.In each frame period, (n-1)-th and n-th codewords collectively
form a p-th or p-ary group, where n is variable between 2
and N, both inclusive and p is consequently variable between
1 and P or N/2. Irrespective of active and inactive, the radio
receivers are grouped into first through P-th groups. In at
least one of the successive frame periods that consecutively
appears after the preamble in the radio signal, the codewords
of the p-ary group serves as an address signal representative
of an address preliminarily assigned to a certain one of the
radio receives of the p-th group that will herein be called
a particular receiver.Following the address signal either immediately or
with one of the frame synchronization signals interposed, consecutive
codewords of the successive frame periods are altogether used
as a message signal representative of a message directed to
