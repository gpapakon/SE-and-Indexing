<ABSTRACT>
A control system for governing turbocharged internal 
combustion engines including an electronic control unit 

(10), a fuel flow control valve (38), and engine speed 
sensor (50), and a bypass valve (30) to control exhaust 

gas flow through an exhaust bypass conduit (29). When 
engine speed is above a first predetermined engine speed, 

the electronic control unit (10) controls the bypass 
valve (30) to regulate exhaust gas flow through the 

bypass conduit (28), thereby limiting exhaust gas flow 
through the turbocharger (12). When the engine speed 

reaches a second, predetermined engine speed value that 
is higher than the first predetermined engine value, the 

electronic control unit (10) completely opens the bypass 
valve (30) allowing virtually total bypass of the 

turbocharger (12), and limits fuel flow to the engine by 
controlling the fuel flow control valve (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to a control system
for an internal combustion engine with turbocharger, and
more specifically to a governing system to limit engine
speed and output torque in response to certain operating
conditions.In the field of internal combustion engines, tire
self-limiting characteristics of the unsupercharged or
normally aspirated petrol engine will usually prevent
excessive engine speed. In most cases, the self-limiting
characteristics establish a balance between the torque
required to overcome friction and windage losses and the
torque developed in the unloaded engine at full throttle at
a speed sufficiently low to prevent self-destruction.
However, in applications where an air supercharging device
is used to increase engine output a maximum engine speed
limiting device becomes a virtual necessity. Typically, a
governor is the device used to control the maximum engine
speed.A governor can be a mechanical or electromechanical
device for automatically controlling the speed of an engine
by regulating the intake of fuel. The governor limits the
amount of fuel delivered to the engine once a predetermined
engine speed is reached. When an engine is operated close
to the governor engine speed setting, the engine speed
oscillates above and below tire governor setting due to
delays in engine response to the reduction in fuel.
Oscillation around the governor engine speed setting is an
undesirable operating condition known as "hunting". The simplest method of achieving stability in the
system and eliminating hunting is to add a control system
that will provide speed droop in the governor. Speed
droop is a sharp decrease in engine output torque above
the governor set point. The sharp decrease in output
torque caused by the speed droop of the governor acts to
provide stability at the governor set point.Speed droop in a simple mechanical governor can be
provided by a mechanical interconnection between servo
movement and governor speed setting such that, as fuel is
increased, the speed setting is decreased. The servo is
positioned in response to movement of the throttle. Such
a device may consist simply of a lever of suitable ratio
between servo and speeder spring. The equilibrium
relationship between speed setting and servo position for
such a system may be represented by a line sloping or
"drooping" downward to indicate a lower speed setting with
movement of the servo toward the higher fuel delivery
position.While the governing systems placed on internal
combustion engines provide
