<ABSTRACT>
Composite material including a matrix consisting chiefly of an intermetallic compound of the AlNi type containing from 1.5 to 30 % of silicon atoms in solid solution and a reinforcement consisting of silicon carbide SiC particles dispersed in this matrix. The presence of silicon in this material results in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium which does not change further by matrix/SiC reinforcement chemical reaction when heated to high temperature. This material can be prepared by conventional processes by adding silicon to the starting material or by carrying out, during the production, a limited reaction between an AlNi matrix and the silicon carbide particles.
