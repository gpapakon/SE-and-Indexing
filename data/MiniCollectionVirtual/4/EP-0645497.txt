<ABSTRACT>
The water fitting comprises a hollow body (4) adapted 
to be mounted in an opening (9) of a tub by means of a 

ring nut (10) which is screwed on to said body so as to 
tighten the opposite edges of the opening between 

respective peripheral surfaces of the hollow body and the 
ring nut. A ring (15) is mounted on the body (4), so as 

to enclose the external edge of its peripheral surface 
(12), and has a front wall (16) that covers said surface 

(12) of the body (4), while situating itself between said 
surface and the tub. The body (4) is provided with a vent 

hole (18) and a second through-hole (19) extending 
outwards from said surface (12) of the body. Sealant 

material can be injected through said through-hole (19) 
into the hollow spaces between the body (4), the ring 

(15) and the wall (8) of the tub.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved type of water 
fitting for bath tubs or similar equipment for sanitary 
uses. In particular, but not exclusively, the present 
invention refers to an improved type of water outlet 
adapted to be used to whirlpool-type bath tubs or pools 
to the purpose of delivering a mixture of air and water 
under pressure, as this is described for instance in EP-A-0 
560 097. Such a water delivery outlet comprises mainly a 
manifold body provided with an inlet connection for 
letting in water under pressure, at least an air suction 
connection, and a swiveling outlet nozzle for said air-water 
mixture. The water delivery outlet is mounted on 
the wall of a whirlpool-type bath tub, in correspondence 
of an appropriate hole and under arrangement of at least 
a sealing means therebetween, by means of a front ring 
nut screwed on to the front inner surface of the manifold 
body. In order to ensure effective water-tight sealing in 
correspondence of the hole in the tub wall, so as to 
exclude water leakages or seepages that could bring about 
flooding and/or corrosion problems, it is a current  
 
practice to apply a layer of silicone-based sealant on 
the surfaces of the manifold body and the ring nut 
between which the edge of the hole in the tub wall is 
then tightened. On the other hand, when the ring nut is screwed on to 
the manifold body, the silicione tends to get squeezed 
away, thereby giving rise to unattractive blurs or smears 
on the walls of the tub (particularly on those exposed to 
the sight) which can act as dirt traps. It is therefore 
necessary that these smearings be accurately removed 
through an additional, undesired operation which is 
particularly difficult and toilsome and which could also 
quite easily cause the surfaces of the tub to be 
accidentaly scratched. The above described assembly, with the related 
drawbacks, is generally carried out even in the case in 
which the water fitting comprises an outlet or drain 
connection, a fixed water-inlet or water-delivery nozzle, 
etc. It is therefore a purpose of the present invention to 
provide a water fitting for bath tubs, or similar 
sanitary equipment, which has such a simple structure as 
to enable it to be mounted on to the tub in a 
particularly convenient, reliable and quick manner. According to the present invention, such an aim is 
reached in a water fitting for bath tubs, or similar 
sanitary equipment, comprising the features as claimed in 
the appended claims. Features and advantages of the present
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Water fitting for bath tubs or similar equipment, 
comprising a hollow body and a ring nut, the hollow body 

being adapted to be mounted in correspondence of an 
opening in a wall of the tub or equipment by means of said ring nut, 

which is frontally screwed on to said body so as to 
tighten the opposite edges of the opening between 

respective peripheral surfaces of the hollow body and the 
ring nut, respectively, 
characterized in that
: 

a ring (15) is mounted on the body (4) so as to 
enclose the external edge of its peripheral surface (12), 

said ring (15) having a front wall (16) that extends 
radially for a certain length so as to at least partially 

cover said surface (12) of the body (4), while situating 
itself in a mounted state 

between said surface and said wall (8) of the tub or equipment, 
the peripheral surface (12) of the hollow body and/or the 

front wall (16) of the ring being arranged to provide for 
a peripherally extending hollow space communicating into the hollow spaces possibly existing 

between the ring nut (10), the hollow body (4), the ring 
(15) and the wall (8); 
said body (4) is provided with at least a first vent 
through-hole (18) and at least a second through-hole (19) 

extending outwards from said surface (12) of the body; 
said peripherally extending hollow space and said 
further hollow spaces being arranged to receive an amount 

of fluid or semi-fluid sealant material which is injected 
through said second through-hole (19), so as to provide a 

water-tight seal between the water fitting and the 
opening (9) in the tub or equipment. 
Water fitting according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 said through-holes (18, 19) are provided on said 
surface (12) of the body (4) in respective diametrically 

opposed positions. 
Water fitting according to claim 2, 
characterized 
in that
 said second through-hole (19) extends with an 
increasing diameter towards the outside of the body (4), 

so as to build a seat adapted to accomodate the spout of 
a device intended to apply said sealant material. 
Water fitting according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 said front wall (16) of the ring (15) comprises 
at least a lip-shaped annular portion (17) which is 

adapted to act as a sealing gasket. 
Water fitting according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
peripheral surface of the body comprises a perimetral 

groove, said through-holes (18, 19) 
extending from said surface (12) in correspondence of said 

groove (14).
