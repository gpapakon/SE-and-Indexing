<ABSTRACT>
Method for finish-grinding premachined annular disc-shaped metallic workpieces (1), in particular motor-vehicle brake discs with brake disc head (2) and annular disc-shaped brake disc rim (3). A workpiece receptacle is driven so as to rotate about a workpiece receptacle axis, and a grinding tool receptacle (4) is driven by a drive shaft (5) so as to rotate about a grinding tool receptacle axis substantially parallel to the workpiece receptacle axis. The work is carried out with a grinding tool designed as a ring tool (6) with ring-shaped grindstone (7). The ring tool (6) is subject to a follow-up control without ball-and-socket joint on the workpiece (1) to be ground and to this end is connected, to be elastically compliant on all sides, to the drive shaft (5) of the grinding tool receptacle (4) so that the workpiece receptacle axis and the grinding tool receptacle axis can be set askew relative to one another by the follow-up control.
