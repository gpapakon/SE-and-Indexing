<ABSTRACT>
Telephone set providing for telephone 
communications and cleaning and disinfecting 

the speaking and hearing areas of the earpiece or 
microphone, made of plastic, and comprising inside 

of the telephone case the components of a 
mechanical system providing for said cleaning 

and which is comprised of a cassette cartridge 
(similar to photographic cassettes) with two reels: 

a supply reel on which is wound a cleaning cloth 
impregnated with disinfectant liquid and a receiving 

reel to which the cleaning cloth is wound 
after it has passed through the cleaning window 

provided at the location of speaking and hearing 
areas of the earpiece or microphone, which areas are cleaned by friction with the cleaning cloth which is displaced manually or 

electrically from one reel to the other reel. The cassette is either of the disposable type or of the continuous use type. The quality 
of life is improved by preventing contamination by diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a telephone set similar to the common one used
currently and commercialised for public and private use, with the additional
characteristic that it allows the cleaning and disinfection of both the hearing
and the speaking areas of the telephone receiver, before the user comes
into contact with it.Some telephone sets with cleaning device are already known. Thus, the
German patent DE 2 649 297 describes a telephone having a cleaning cloth
which is impregnated with antiseptic liquid. This cleaning cloth is inserted as
a plug in a sort of hermetic foil which closes it along three of its sides,
allowing a high stage of impregnation, and such cleaning cloth rolling up
along its length so that the cleaning face of the cloth remains in contact with
the hermetic foil of the previous turn.The British patent GB 2 246 050 describes a telephone set wherein the
cleaning device consists of a dish-shaped brush which is saturated of
antiseptic liquid and placed on a revolving lodge, so that it cleans the
speaking area of the receiver by means of a rubbing of such receiver with the
impregnated brush in a rotation over its own revolution axle. Same this
device as the one described in the German patent DE 2 649 297 suffer from a
relative short life of impregnations of the cleaning cloth, since the quantity of
antiseptic liquid that can be stored is limited somehow.There are other means of cleaning which do not resort to an antiseptic liquid.
Thus, the British patent GB 2 221 818 uses an emitter of ultraviolet radiation
to sterilize the bacterial flora which could have accumulated in the receiver.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an antiseptic
telephone set, public or private, which, in addition to its main purpose of
communication, also allows the effective cleaning and disinfection of the
speaking and hearing areas of the receiver thereof in an easy and simple
manner to prevent the contamination by diseases. The chosen system consists
of the use of a disposable cartridge which comprises a cleaning cloth and a
big-volume reservoir of disinfectant liquid, being the cleaning cloth
impregnated with disinfectant liquid while acting on the receiver. In order to buttress the foregoing effect and to make sure the liquid contained
in the reservoir does not evaporate, there is a sliding cover planned for sealing
off as hermetic as possible the housing of the telephone as a whole, since the
sealing off of the reservoir of liquid itself is certainly incomplete for
it presents
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A telephone set comprising

a base (2)
a receiver (1) having speaking and hearing portions; said base (2) having
windows (6) for receiving the speaking and hearing portions,

charaterized in that said base windows (6) having sliding covers (7) to close
said base (2) housing and said base (2) having a disposable cartridge case

(13) comprising a cleaning cloth (21), and an antiseptic liquid (19) in a
reservoir (18), so that after opening of sliding covers (7), the cleaning cloth

(21) is impregnated in antiseptic liquid (19) as it unrolls from emission reel
(14) and taken in by the recovery reel (28) while such cleaning cloth (21)

is passing through the antiseptic liquid reservoir (18).
A telephone set according to claim 1, characterized in that the cleaning
cloth (21) is provided with perforation means along opposite longitudinal

sides for receiving reels and thus allow the movement of said cleaning
cloth (21) in an independent mood from said recovery reel (28).
