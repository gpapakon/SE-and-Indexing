<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a process for producing an 
acrylic or methacrylic ester, comprising the steps of: 


(a) reacting acrylic or methacrylic acid with an 
alcohol having 4 or more carbon atoms in the presence of an 

acid catalyst to synthesize the corresponding ester; 
(b) washing the reaction liquid obtained in step 
(a) with water, followed by separation into the reaction 

liquid and an aqueous solution containg the acid catalyst; 
and 
(c) recycling the aqueous solution obtained in 
step (b) to step (a).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for 
producing acrylic or methacrylic esters. More 
particularly, this invention provides -an industrially 
advantageous process for producing acrylic or methacrylic 
esters in which an acid catalyst used for esterification 
reaction is efficiently recovered and reused. For the industrial production of acrylic or 
methacrylic esters from acrylic or methacrylic acid and 
alcohols having 4 or more carbon atoms, the method in which 
the esterification reaction is carried out by using a 
strong acid as a catalyst, as described in, for instance, 
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 271247/1986, has 
been conventionally employed. The esterification reaction between acrylic or 
methacrylic acid and an alcohol having 4 or more carbon 
atoms is an equilibrium reaction. Therefore, the 
conversion in the reaction cannot exceed a certain degree 
which is determined by an equilibrium constant. In order 
to increase the degree of conversion in the reaction, it is 
necessary to use a large excess of either one of acrylic 
(or methacrylic) acid and an alcohol (German Patent No. 
2548561), or to remove water (reaction water) produced in 
the reaction from the reaction mixture. The removal of the 
reaction water is usually effected by distillation. A 
third component may be added as an azeotropic agent in 
order to increase the efficiency of the distillation 
(Japanese Patent Publication No. 41663/1987). As the strong acids for use as a catalyst, there 
may be mentioned sulfuric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, 
benzenesulfonic acid, xylenesulfonic acid, 
naphthenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, etc. These 
stong acids must be removed from the reaction liquid after  
 
the reaction is completed. As apost-treatment method for removing the strong 
acid, there has been proposed a method in which the 
reaction liquid is treated with an aqueous alkaline 
solution for neutralization (Japanese Laid-Open Patent 
Publications Nos. 243046/1986, 34965/1991 and 230240/1992). 
According to this method, a large amount of alkali is 
needed for effecting a sufficient neutralization. 
Moreover, it is very difficult to separate and recover the 
acid catalyst and unreacted acrylic or methacrylic acid 
from the aqueous alkaline solution after the treatment and, 
therefore, the aqueous alkaline solution must be disposed 
as a waste-after the treatment. This method thus has the 
drawback of the production of a large amount of waste water 
which contains the harmful organic acid salt at a
