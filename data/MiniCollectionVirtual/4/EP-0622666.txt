<ABSTRACT>
Post-processing stabilizers for photothermographic, silver imaging media 
are disclosed. The stabilizers are represented by the following general 

formulae: 

wherein: R¹, R², and R³ are independently H, halogen, an alkyl group, an 
alkoxy group, a thioalkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a perhalogenated alkyl 

group, or taken together form a cycloaliphatic group. 
Compounds of formula (I) may be used as stabilizer precursors in 
photothermographic silver imaging media to provide post-processing stability 

without significantly adversely affecting desired properties of the 
photothermographic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photothermographic materials and in particular, it 
relates to post-processing stabilization of photothermographic silver-containing 
materials. Silver halide-containing photothermographic imaging materials processed with 
heat, and without liquid development, have been known in the art for many years. 
These materials generally comprise a support having thereon light-sensitive silver 
halide; a light-insensitive, organic silver salt; and a reducing agent for the light-insensitive 
organic silver salt. The light-sensitive silver halide is in catalytic proximity to the light-insensitive 
organic silver salt so that the latent image, formed by irradiation of the silver halide, 
serves as a catalyst for the oxidation-reduction reaction of the light-insensitive, 
organic silver salt with the reducing agent when the emulsion is heated above about 
80°C. Such media are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,457,075; 
3,839,049; and 4,260,677. A variety of ingredients may be added to these basic components to enhance 
performance. For example, toning agents may be incorporated to improve the color 
of the silver image of the photothermographic emulsions, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. 
Nos. 3,846,136; 3,994,732; and 4,021,249. Various methods to produce dye images 
and multicolor images with photographic color couplers and leuco dyes are disclosed 
in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,022,617; 3,531,286; 3,180,731; 3,761,270; 4,460,681; 
4,883,747; and Research Disclosure, March 1989, item 29963. A common problem that exists with photothermographic systems is post-processing 
instability of the image. The photoactive silver halide still present in the 
developed image may continue to catalyze print-out of metallic silver during room  
 
light handling. Thus, there exists a need for stabilization of the unreacted silver 
halide. The addition of separate post-processing image stabilizers has been used to 
impart post-processing stability. Most often these are sulfur-containing compounds 
such as mercaptans, thiones, and thioethers as described in ResearchDisclosure, June 
1978, item 17029. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,245,033; 4,837,141; and 4,451,561 describe 
sulfur compounds that are development restrainers for photothermographic systems. 
Mesoionic 1,2,4-triazolium-3-thiolates as fixing agents and silver halide stabilizers are 
disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,378,424. Substituted 5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazoles such 
as 3-amino-5-benzothio-1,2,4-triazole as post-processing stabilizers are disclosed in 
U.S. Pat. Nos.
