A cutting insert for chip-forming machining, in particular 
for roughing of metallic workpieces with a high feed rate, 

having a chip surface (10, 16) which is provided in the 
region of a cutting edge (12) with indentations (14) which 

are arranged in a row extending along the cutting 
edge (12), which interrupt same and which have a generally 

trapezoidal sectional shape parallel to the cutting 
edge (12) and perpendicular to the chip surface (10) with 

trapezoidal sides open toward the chip surface
 
characterized in that
 
the indentations have a chip-surface base extending at a 

negative or 0° rake angle (19) to the cutting edge (12), 
the chip surface (16) in the region between the 

indentations (14) at the cutting edge (12) has a positive 
rake angle (17) of at least 5°, and the transitions (26) 

from the negative chip-surface base (18) to the 
trapezoidal sides (25) and from the trapezoid sides (25) 

to the chip-surface regions (16) surrounding the 
indentations (14) are rounded. 
The cutting insert according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the trapezoid side angles (20, 21; 201, 211, 202, 

212) are between 30° and 80°. 
The cutting insert according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the negative chip angle (19) of the 

trapezoidal base (18) of the indentation (14) lies between 
0° and 20°, preferably between 5° and 15°. 
The cutting insert according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the positive rake angle (17) of the 

chip surface (16) surrounding the indentations (14) is 
between 5° and 25°, preferably 5° and 20°.  

 
The cutting insert according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the spacings (24; 241 to 243) of the 

indentations (14) at the cutting edge (12) are smaller 
than the width (23) of the indentations (14) or increase 

uniformly with increasing spacing from the cutting 
edge (13). 
The cutting insert according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the indentation (14) seen in a top 

view on the chip surface (10, 16) are generally 
rectangular, preferably trapezoidal. 
The cutting insert according to one of claim 1 to 6, 
characterized in that a chamfer (15) adjoins to the 

cutting edge (12). 
The cutting insert according to claim 7, characterized in 
that the angle between the chamfer (15) lying in the chip-surface 

plane (10, 16) and the positive chip-surface 
region (16) between the indentations (14) is the same as 

the angle between this chamfer (15) and the negative chip-surface 
base (18) of the indentation (14), the angle 

preferably is between 160 and 175°. 
The cutting insert according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the chip-surface base (18) of the 

indentation (14) or the surrounding chip surface (16) has 
an additional chip groove (33, 34). 
The cutting insert according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the chip surface (16) surrounding 

the indentation(s) (14) has at a spacing from the cutting 
edge (12) raised chip-forming elements (31, 32), 

preferably shaped as pyramidal or conical frustums.
