<ABSTRACT>
A method of sampling and determining the presence of certain residues of contaminants in containers comprising the steps of: injecting compressed air into said containers in order to displace at least a portion of the contents thereof; evacuating a sample of the container contents so displaced by applying suction thereto; and analyzing the sample evacuated to determine the presence or absence of the certain residues therein. The compressed air is injected through a nozzle into an opening in the containers to displace a portion of the container contents and form a sample cloud outside of the container. The sample cloud is then at least partially evacuated by suction and the sample is analyzed for the presence of contaminants such as nitrogen containing compounds or hydrocarbons. In one embodiment about 90 % of the sample evacuated is diverted from the analyzer and recirculated into the air injector. A wide range of potential contaminants are detectable if beverage bottles are stored uncapped, prior to testing to give beverage product volatiles sufficient time to dissipate.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR SAMPLING AND DETERMINING THE PRESENCE OF CONTAMINANTS IN CONTAINERSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a container inspection system for sampling and determining the presence of certain substances, such as residues of contaminants within containers such as glass or plastic bottles. More specifically, the present invention relates to an improved sampling and analyzing system and method for determining the presence of residues of these contaminants in containers such as beverage bottles rapidly moving along a conveyor past a test station in a container sorting system.In many industries, including the beverage industry, products are packaged in containers which are returned after use, washed and refilled. Typically refillable containers, such as beverage bottles, are made of glass which can be easily cleaned. These containers are washed and then inspected for the presence of foreign matter.Glass containers have the disadvantage of being fragile and, in larger volumes, of being relatively heavy. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to use plastic containers because they are less fragile and lighter than glass containers of the same volume. However, plastic materials tend to absorb a variety of organic compounds which may later be desorbed into the product thereby potentially adversely 

 affecting the quality of the product packed in the container. Examples of such organic compounds are nitrogen containing compounds such as ammonia, organic nitrogen compounds, and hydrocarbons including gasoline and various cleaning fluids.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a method and system for detecting the presence or absence of a wide range of specific substances - e.g., contaminants such as nitrogen containing compounds and hydrocarbons, in containers as the containers move rapidly along a conveyor on the way to or from a washer assembly or the like.It is another object of the present invention to provide a system and method for sampling and analyzing residues in containers as they move along a conveyor without stopping the movement of the containers or impeding the movement in any way in order that high speed sampling rates of about 200 to 1000 bottles per minute may be achieved.It is still another object of the present invention to provide a system and method for sampling and analyzing residues in containers moving along a conveyor without contacting the container being tested with any of the sampling and

What is claimed is:
1. A method of sampling and determining the presence of volatiles of certain contaminants in a container which was previously filled with a beverage, said container including an opening which is closeable by a cap, comprising the steps of: storing said container with the cap removed for a sufficient period of time to permit volatiles of residues of the beverage to evaporate and egress from said container; evacuating a sample of volatiles remaining in the container after expiration of said sufficient period of time; and analyzing the sample evacuated to determine the presence or absence of the certain contaminants therein.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein said analyzing step includes the steps of: mixing the sample with a chemical reactant to cause a chemical reaction therewith in order to generate chemiluminescence of the reactants; and analyzing radiation emitted by chemiluminescence of the sample and reactant to determine the presence or absence of said volatiles of certain contaminants without interference from chemiluminescence of volatiles of the beverage.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the step of analyzing includes the steps of: filtering radiation emitted by chemiluminescence of the sample to detect the presence of radiation having wavelengths above about 0.19 micron; and 


 identifying the presence or absence of said certain contaminants from the radiation detected at characteristic wavelengths above about 0.19 micron.
4. The method of claim 2 including the further step of heating the sample to about 400"C to 1400
β
C prior to said mixing step, and wherein the chemical reactant is ozone.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein said sufficient period of time is about 15 hours.
6. A method of sampling and determining the presence of volatiles of certain contaminants in a container which was previously filled with a beverage, said container including an opening which is closeable by a cap, comprising the steps of: storing said container with the cap removed for a sufficient period of time to permit volatiles of residues of the beverage to evaporate and egress from said container; injecting fluid into the opening in said container after expiration of said sufficient period of time in order to displace at least a portion of the volatiles therefrom; and evacuating a sample of the volatiles so displaced.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein said analyzing step includes the steps of: mixing the sample with a chemical reactant to cause a chemical reaction therewith in order to generation chemiluminescence of the reactants; and analyzing radiation emitted by chemiluminescence of the sample and reactant to determine the presence or absence of said volatiles of certain contaminants without interference
