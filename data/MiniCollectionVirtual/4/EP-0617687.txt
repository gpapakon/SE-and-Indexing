<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container and relates 
particularly, but not exclusively, to an aircraft cargo 
container which is capable of expanding thereby to facilitate 
containment of an explosive blast therein. Blast mitigating panels for cargo containers have a 
tendency to 'bow' outwards when an explosive charge is 
detonated inside the container. The panels often fail at 
their edges and corners where they are attached to each other 
or to a frame, before the material of the panel fails. The longer a blast can be contained, and the more 
expandable the container, the greater the energy the blast 
wave has to expend in disrupting the cargo container. The 
consequence of a longer containment time is expected to be a 
reduction in impulse loading and any emerging wave is less 
energetic when it interacts with the structure of the 
aircraft. There therefore exists a requirement for a cargo 
container capable of absorbing a significant proportion of the 
explosive blast energy from an explosion thereby to reduce 
impulse loading on an aircraft structure. GB-A-1083431 discloses sheet of flexible material for use 
as part of a liquefied gas container in which the flexibility 
permits absorption of contraction and expansion effects 
without damage to the container.  
 GB-A-706 611 discloses a land, sea and air cargo 
container formed from corrugated metal panels for strength and 
rigidity. FR-A-1 061 835 discloses the use of corrugated metal 
sheets for containers to improve rigidity. DE-A-30 3030 430 discloses the use of perforated sheets 
of metal of thin wall thickness to increase elasticity and 
flexibility. Techniques investigated by British Aerospace Plc's 
Sowerby Research Centre have illustrated that the following 
apparatus could provide a cargo container which reduces and 
possibly eliminates the above mentioned problems. Accordingly, the present invention provides a container 
formed from a plurality of sheet-like panels and having a 
blast attenuation means, said attenuation means comprising one 
or more expandable regions for expansion under blast loading 
thereby to absorb a portion of the blast energy contained in 
the blast, which one or more expandable regions comprise and/or 
incorporate one or more 
non-planar members, characterised in that said one or more 
non-planar members have a blast absorbing deformable or 
crushable material on at least one surface thereof. Preferably, the one or more expandable regions comprise 
a corrugated or concertina shaped panel having laterally

<CLAIMS>
A container formed from a plurality of sheet-like panels 
(12,14,20,22) 

and having a blast attenuation means, said attenuation means 
comprising one or more expandable regions for expansion under 

blast loading thereby to absorb a portion of the blast energy 
contained in the blast, which one or more expandable regions comprise 

and/or incorporate one or more non-planar members, characterised in 
that said one or more 

non-planar members have a blast absorbing deformable or 
crushable material (24) on at least one surface thereof. 
A container as claimed in claim 1, in which the one or 
more expandable regions comprise a corrugated or concertina 

shaped panel (12,14,20,22) having laterally expanding portions 
(20a,20b,22a,22b) which in operation expand to allow the 

container (10) to expand before structural failure occurs. 
A container as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 in which 
each expandable region comprises two panels (20,22) arranged 

the one on the other in substantially parallel relationship 
and defining a gap (G) therebetween. 
A container as claimed in claim 3 in which the panels 
(20,22) are arranged the one on the other in out of phase 

relationship. 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, in 
which each expandable region comprises two panels (20,22) each 

having a substantially flat end portion (30) arranged to 
overlap the substantially flat end portion of the other (32) 

in a manner which allows sliding of one sheet over the other.  
 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, in 
which said one or more panels (20,22) are perforated thereby 

to allow a portion of the blast energy to pass therethrough. 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 
wherein the blast absorbing deformable or crushable material 

(24) is located between the panels and/or on a surface of one 
or both of said panels (12,14). 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7 
including first and second backing sheets (36,38) between an 

expandable region is contained. 
A container as claimed in claim 8, in which said first 
and second backing sheets (36,38) form inner and outer 

surfaces of the container (10). 
A container as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 9 in 
which the blast attenuation means forms part of, or all of, 

one or more of said panels (12,14,20,22). 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 10 
including a plurality of panels (12,14,20,22) arranged the one 

on top of the other with the corrugations or concertinas of 
each panel extending in directions substantially orthogonal to 

each other. 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11, in 
which the wavelength of the non planar member varies between 

panels thereby to facilitate progressive failure of the 
container (10).  

 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 12 in 
which the corrugations or concertinas form concentric rings 

(70) around a central point. 
A container as claimed in claim 13 in which the central 
point (x) comprises the centre of the panel (12,14), or the 

corner of the panel, or a point adjacent the edge of the 
panel. 
A container as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 13 
including one or more friction elements (60) for joining one 

or bore panels (12,14) to each other. 
A container as claimed in claim 15, in which said one or

increasing the frictional engagement.

entire length of each edge (12a,14a) of a panel so as to form

more expandable regions comprises a panel (80) or panels of
