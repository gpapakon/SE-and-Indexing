<ABSTRACT>
A microstructure for a vibratory gyroscope 
has a ring portion (14) supported so as to allow 

substantially undamped, high-Q radial vibration. The 
ring portion (14) is electrically conductive and 

comprises a charge plate (14) for a plurality of 
radially disposed charge conductive sites (13) around 

its perimeter for sensing radial displacements 
thereof. The ring (14), its support (15) and charge 

conductive sites (13) are formed within sacrificial 
moulds on one surface of a conventional silicon 

substrate which may comprise a monolithic integrated 
circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
microstructure for a vibratory gyroscope.The field of rotation sensors is typified by
devices applying vibrating mechanical elements
(vibratory elements) as the rotation indication means.
Numerous base forms of vibratory elements used in such
vibratory rotation sensors are known including discs,
tuning forks, cylinders and hemispherical shells. All
such vibratory rotation sensors exploit the effects of
the Coriolis force produced by the rotation of its
vibratory element(s). The Coriolis force is known to
influence detectably the orientation of a resonant
vibratory pattern (standing wave) in a vibratory
element in proportion with the rotation of the element
but independent of the rate of rotation.Perhaps the most widely known form of
vibratory rotation sensors employ three hemispherical
shells as vibratory elements to detect rotation about
three mutually orthogonal axes. Known in commercial
avionics as Hemispherical Resonator Gyros (HRG), these
devices provide a very high degree of accuracy and
sensitivity at low rotation rates as required by
inertial grade navigation systems. Other features of
HRG include longer useful operating life, higher
reliability and a more cost effective system than many
alternative rotation sensing technologies for
commercial and military aviation.Other vibratory rotation sensors are
intended mainly for weapons guidance and control.
Performance of this grade of sensor must withstand
large linear and rotational accelerations
characteristic of munitions. These types of sensors
are more compact and less costly than HRG but are less
accurate and sensitive at low rotation rates. Rotation sensing packages which are
financially and functionally attractive in
navigational avionics or weapons guidance are not so
in other areas, for example commercial automotive
electronics. Cost alone, aside from other factors
such as size, mass and functional excesses or
deficiencies would prohibit incorporation of such a
device in an automobile for rotation sensing.
