Continuously variable split-torque hydromechanical transmission having at least 
two operating regions selectable via gear elements; 


1.1 with a first, mechanical portion (11), which comprises a planetary differential gear 
(5), having at least two sun gears (6, 7) of differing diameters, an internal gear (11) and 

a pin shaft (10), upon which there are arranged double planetary gears (8, 9) (rotation-fast 
connected planetary wheels), which mesh with the sun gears (6, 7), the large sun 

gear (6) being coupled with the transmission input shaft (2) and the pin shaft (10) being 
coupled with the transmission output shaft (4); 
1.2 with a second, hydrostatic portion (I) which comprises two displaceable 
hydrostatic units (H1, H2), coupled together in an energy-transmitting manner, which 

are operable in both directions as pump or motor, and which are coupled with the 
mechanical portion (11); 
1.3 wherein in the individual operating regions the internal gear (11) is coupled with a 
first hydrostatic unit (H1) to control the direction of rotation and the speed of the 

transmission output shaft (4); 
1.4 wherein in the first operating region the second hydrostatic unit (H2) is drive 
connected via a change-over element (K1/K2) to the transmission output shaft (4), and 

the first hydrostatic unit (H1) connected to the internal gear (11) operates as a pump 
and the second hydrostatic unit (H2) operates as a motor; 
1.5 both hydrostatic units (H1, H2), in the first and second operating regions 
respectively, run in contrary directions to one another through their adjustment range 

between minimum and maximum, wherein they respectively exchange their functions 
during the transition from the first into the second operating region and vice versa; 
 
characterised by the following features: 


1.6 the internal gear (11) can be coupled by means of a second change-over element 
(K3/K4) optionally via a first gear drive (SR
1
/VR
1
) or a second gear drive (SR
2
/UR/VR
2
) 
with the input or output shaft (17) of the first hydrostatic unit (H1); 
1.7 the first gear drive (SR
1
/VR
1
) is so constructed that, when the internal gear (11) is 
coupled with the first hydrostatic unit (H1) via the first gear drive (SR
1
/VR
1
), the internal  
 

gear (11) and the input or output shaft (17) of the first hydrostatic unit (H1) have 
differing directions of rotation; 
1.8 the second gear drive (SR
2
/UR/VR
2
) is so constructed that, when coupled to the 
first hydrostatic unit (H1), the intemal gear (11) and input or output shaft (17) of the 

hydrostatic unit (H1) have the same direction of rotation. 
Continuously variable split-torque hydromechanical transmission according to 
claim 1, characterised in that the first and the second gear drives (SR
1
/VR
1
 and 
SR
2
/UR/VR
2
) are so constructed that both have the same transmission ratio. 
Continuously variable split-torque hydromechanical transmission according to one 
of claims 1 or 2, characterised by the following features: 


3.1 the first gear drive (SR
1
/VR
1
) comprises a first spur gear (SR
1
) connected rotation-fast 
to the internal gear (11), and a first layshaft gear (VR
1
) which can be coupled to the 
input or output shaft (17) of the first hydrostatic unit (H1), which mesh with one another; 
3.2 the second gear drive (SR
2
/UR/VR
2
) comprises a second spur gear (SR
2
) 
connected rotation-fast to the internal gear (11), a second layshaft gear (VR
2
) which 
can be coupled with the input or output shaft (17) of the first hydrostatic unit (H1), and 

an intermediate gear (UR), which couples the second spur gear (SR
2
) with the second 
layshaft gear (VR
2
). 
Continuously variable split-torque hydromechanical transmission according to one 
of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the hydrostatic coupling of both hydrostatic units 

(H1, H2) is effected by means of a connector block (H1/H2), comprising two non-return 
valves (20a, 20b) and two pressure limiting valves (21, 22).
