<ABSTRACT>
The invention is an extruded bicomponent elastomeric netting having unidirectional elasticity. Such a netting product is a non-woven article employing a non-elastic material such as polypropylene (10) in the machine direction strands and an elastic material such as a styrenic block copolymer (12) in the cross machine direction strands. The reverse arrangement, a product with "reverse strand distribution", is also possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to plastic netting, and more particularly to an
extruded bicomponent elastomeric netting having unidirectional elasticity, that is
in either the machine direction or the transverse direction.For purposes of the present invention, the terms "cross machine
direction" and "transverse direction" are synonymous and sometimes simply
referred to as "TD", as are the terms "longitudinal direction" and "machine
direction", sometimes simply referred to as "MD". However, the term "transverse"
is sometimes also used to refer to strands which extend in a direction opposite
to that of strands previously referred to. The meaning will be clear from the
context in any particular instance. Current production elastomeric roll goods,
such as scrims, sheets, films, foams, nettings, nonwovens, fibers, threads and
the like are basically isotropic, exhibiting essentially the same properties in all
directions of their two dimensional plane. However, in many applications,
elastomeric properties are desired in only one direction, while elastomeric
properties in the other direction are unnecessary or even detrimental to product
functionality. Although numerous patents exist describing netting, woven and
non-woven fabrics, meshes and chain nets with bicomponent materials or
unidirectional elasticity or netlike articles, they do not provide any suggestion to
modify the prior art such as is done in the present invention with respect to
extruded plastic net. Existing technology does not include an extruded
bicomponent elastomeric netting with unidirectional elasticity which may be
manufactured more economically than most conventional elastomeric netting on
the market.Nets, wovens and nonwoven reinforcements made of more than
one material are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,636,419 to Madsen, U.S. Patent
No. 4,241,123 to Shih, and U.S. Patent No. 4,460,633 to Kobayashi et al. In
addition, a netting die fed by two separate polymer streams is disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 3,791,784 to Arechavaleta.U.S. Patent No. 4,636,419 issued to Madsen et al on January 13, 
1987 discloses a "Net and Method of Producing Same" which employs a
combination of side by side extrusion streams, transversal embossment, and
splitting to produce netting composed of a regular array of longitudinal ribbon-formed
continuous polymer filaments and a regular array of transverse stems or
strands of a different polymer material. It is disclosed that the use of two
different polymer substances in two directions affords netting of interesting and
