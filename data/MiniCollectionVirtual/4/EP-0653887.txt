<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a compact multi-camera closed 
circuit video television system for use in commercial 

aircraft. The arrangement of the cameras and the 
construction of the system are arranged to allow 

installation within either the pressurized or 
unpressurized portions of the aircraft, and the video 

cameras are arranged to provide multiple views of the 
exterior of the aircraft under the control of the flight 

crew.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to television camera
systems utilized in commercial aircraft, and more
particularly to a multi-camera closed circuit television
system used to provide video to existing passenger
entertainment video systems in order to provide views of
the environment outside of the aircraft.The advent of on board television in commercial
aircraft for entertainment purposes has provided the focus
for a variety of entertainment options for the passengers.
In addition to the ordinary availability of motion
pictures, other alternatives such as news programs, videos
and the like have been made available to the passenger for
their viewing via selection from a variety of channels
representing different video sources. Furthermore, on
board video systems have been utilized to provide the
passengers with important safety and emergency information
as an adjunct to the normal pre-flight briefings provided
by the flight attendants. In recent times, the use of on-board
video displays has gone increasingly from a
projection type television to individual viewing screens
for the passengers, thus opening up the possibility of
selection by the passenger from among a great number of
possible entertainment sources. One additional source for
such entertainment is a view of the outside environment
through which the aircraft is flying.The first use of such cameras in a commercial
setting was on board wide body aircraft in approximately 
the 1980 time frame. Such systems included a camera
mounted in the cockpit and provided the passengers with a
view of the take-off and landing more or less over the
captain's shoulder. This scenario produced two issues
which eventually led to the removal of the cameras from
the flight deck. The first problem arose because the
camera was mounted on the aft wall looking forward through
the cockpit window, and this scheme resulted in the camera
looking from the low ambient light condition through a
window into either a very high ambient light condition, or
virtual darkness. The auto iris function of the cameras
used was not capable of handling this wide dynamic
lighting range, and as a result the camera provided images
that blossomed the video signal past useable level.
Another problem was, since the camera field of view
included most crew activities within the cockpit, the
flight crews looked upon such exposure as undesirable; the
surveillance also created an area of possible liability
for the company in the event that activities occurred
within the cockpit which resulted in some safety of

<CLAIMS>
An airborne closed circuit television system (20)
comprising first and second cameras (22, 24) each

having camera lens optics including a zoom lens, a
focal plane sensor and an interface electronics unit,

the first camera (22) being arranged to have a first
field of view (26) essentially perpendicular downward

from the aircraft's longitudinal axis, and the second
camera being arranged to have a second field of view

(28) essentially parallel to the aircraft's
longitudinal axis and forward facing, the cameras being arranged adjacent to

each other to provide fields of view (26, 28) which
avoid imaging the adjacent camera;


a remote camera control unit containing
electronics to drive and process image data from the

interface electronics unit of each camera (22, 24);
and
a remote control unit in the flight deck of the
aircraft which allows control of the system by a

member of the flight crew; characterised by:
a sealed camera module unit structure (32) which
houses the two cameras (22, 24) in relation to one

another so as to isolate the cameras from the outside
environment, said camera module unit structure

(32) including a window (30) mounted within said
camera module unit structure providing a field of view

for the cameras (22, 24), said window (30) provided
with means to heat said window, and said camera module

unit structure also including means to heat said cameras ; the
system being also characterised in that the remote camera control unit is external to said sealed camera module unit structure (32).
