<ABSTRACT>
A non-particulate carrier is provided which is adapted to reversibly 
bind a desired material, which may either be the desired end product 

material, or a contaminant which is removed from the desired end product 
material. The carrier is arranged to pass sequentially through a feedstock 

liquid containing the material to be purified where the desired material is 
adsorbed to the carrier, a wash liquid, a desorption liquid into which the 

material is desorbed by the carrier and a further wash liquid. The carrier 
is preferably a non-absorbent natural or synthetic polymer and is 

conveniently in the form of an endless belt. An agent which will 
reversibly bind the desired material may be chemically attached to the 

carrier, and binding of the material to the carrier or binding agent be by 
biospecific affinity, hydrophobic or ionic interactions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for the continuous 
separation and purification of material. It is particularly suitable for, 
although not limited to, the separation and purification of biological 
material, especially proteins. Separations are a fundamental requirement of most biotechnological 
processes, whether this takes the form of biocatalyst isolation, feedstock 
preparation or product purification. As downstream processing can 
account for a substantial proportion of the cost of a biotechnological 
product (Dwyer, 1984) the development of efficient large-scale separation 
techniques is essential, particularly for the purification of low-value/high 
volume products. The most commonly used methods in commercial bioseparations, 
such as precipitation, column chromatography and batch adsorption, are 
discontinuous processes. In liquid chromatography for example, much of 
the process time is spent on column equilibration, regeneration and 
cleaning. Continuous separation processes are attractive as they are less 
labour-intensive and are easily controllable. In addition, many bioreactor 
systems for the production of biotechnological products operate in 
continuous mode. These may therefore be complemented by the 
development of continuous downstream processes which will ease process 
integration and increase efficiency. Various attempts have been made to develop continuous 
chromatography processes for the separation of organic chemicals, but 
these tended to be technically complex and have a low degree of  
 
selectivity (Sussman, 1976). Continuous separations may be simulated by 
using a series of chromatography columns in synchronisation so that 
elution from each column occurs sequentially (Nicoud, 1992). Huang etal (1986) applied this simulated moving bed method to the affinity 
separation of proteins. Affinity interactions are among the most powerful bioseparation 
tools due to their specificity. Continuous affinity separation processes 
have been devised which physically cycle adsorbent between adsorbing 
and desorbing environments (Hughes & Charm, 1979; Burns & Graves, 
1985; Pungor et al, 1987). However, a problem exists in using 
conventional particulate affinity matrices in this way, namely the 
development of a means of isolating the adsorbent from one liquid medium 
and transferring it to another. Burns and Graves used a magnetically stabilized fluidized bed in 
which magnetically susceptible solid particles containing an affinity ligand 
are continually transferred
