<CLAIMS>
Use of triazene or/and pentazadiene polymers as 
photoresists. 
Use as claimed in claim 1 as photolabile protective 
layers for covering biochemical reagents. 
Use as claimed in claim 2 in a method for the 
determination of an analyte in a sample liquid by a 

reaction which proceeds in several steps separated 
from one another in time. 
Process for the production of triazene or/and 
pentazadiene polymers,
wherein
 
a bifunctional aromatic or heteroaromatic amino 

compound is converted by diazotization into a 
corresponding bis-diazonium salt and this is 

subsequently reacted with a compound containing 
amino groups in a polycondensation reaction to 

produce a polymer, wherein 

(a) a bifunctional primary or secondary amine of 
the general formula (I) 


R
