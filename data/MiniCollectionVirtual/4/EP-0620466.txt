<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an apparatus for providing the 
coordinated rotation of two interrelated components and, in particular, relates to one such 
apparatus having first and second cam segment lobes each respectively associated with 
first and second devices and including means for urging the first and second cam segment 
lobes into rotatable contact with each other. There are many instances where it is desirable to control the coordinated rotation 
of two interrelated components. One of the more common instances is the adjustment of 
the interocular distance between two eyepieces, such as the eyepieces used in 
microscopes, binoculars and other optical devices. Although the detailed description of 
this invention will be directed to an optical device embodiment, it will be apparent to 
those skilled in the mechanical arts that the present invention is not, in fact, so limited. Conventional interocular distance adjustment mechanisms include such 
arrangements as interocular gear systems and fork and pin drives. In general, gear 
systems are expensive and can be quite complex if little or no play is acceptable. 
Further, in such play-free arrangements the movement is usually ergonomically rough 
due, primarily, to the high frictional load placed on the bearings of such a system. 
Typical fork and pin drive mechanisms not only exhibit noticeable play but also a 
changing rate of interocular rotation along with excessive friction at the pin/fork 
interface. Although the interocular gear system and the pin and drive arrangements are 
acceptable in many applications they are frequently unacceptable in applications where 
precise, smooth, play-free adjustment of the interocular distance of two eyepieces is 
required. For example, there is an ever increasing use of microscopic instruments in the 
field of medical examination and surgery. In such circumstances, the use of interocular 
gear systems or fork and pin drives is, for the deficiencies cited above, quite unacceptable  
 
to the user. JP-A-61-116311, discloses a distance adjustment apparatus 
for changing the distance between two lens systems. 
There, each lens system is connected with an arm extending 
perpendicular to the optical axis. The two arms of both 
lens systems are rotatably connected to each other by means 
of an axis. Such a structure not only requires a complicated 
machining of the ends of the arms to be connected to 
the axis but also the provision of an axis and respective 
mounting steps for attaching the arms to
