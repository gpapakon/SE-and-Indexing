<ABSTRACT>
String for tennis, comprising a central core (10), first outer filaments (12) rolled helically around this central core, having a diameter d, and second outer filaments (14) inserted between the first filaments, having a diameter D greater than d, the wound package (winding) as a whole being embedded in a coating resin, characterised in that there is an odd number, at least three, of second filaments, these three second filaments being arranged at the vertices of an isosceles triangle.

A tennis racket string comprising a central core (10), first outer filaments (12) 
with a diameter 
d
 wound helically around this central core and second outer filaments 
(14) with a diameter 
D
 greater than 
d
 interposed between the first filaments, the set of 
windings being embedded in a coating resin, characterized in that the number of 

second filaments is odd and at least equal to three, the second filaments of the string 
being disposed three by three at the apices of an isosceles triangle in such a manner 

that, whatever the rotation of the string, the base of the said triangle forms a contact 
surface on a base of the string with which it is crossed. 
A tennis racket string according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises at 
least five second filaments of diameter 
D
, distributed circumferentially in regular 
manner on the periphery of the central core, the diameters 
D
 and 
d
 being such that 
there is a straight line tangent to two successive filaments in such a manner as to form 

a contact base. 
A tennis racket string according to claim 2, characterized in that the five second 
filaments are made from a material resistant to abrasion. 
A tennis racket string according to claim 3, characterized in that the retained 
material is of graphite. 
A tennis racket string according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the core (10) has a diameter of 0.80 mm, the first (12) and second (14) filaments 

have respective diameters of 0.18 and 0.30 mm, and the coating of resin results in an 
outer diameter at the location of the first filaments of 1.30 mm and at the location of 

the second filament of 1.50 mm.
