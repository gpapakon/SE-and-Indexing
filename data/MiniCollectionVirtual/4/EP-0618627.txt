<ABSTRACT>
A compound superconducting wire comprising a 
matrix of CuX alloy and a multiplicity of Z₃X filaments 

embedded in the matrix in a spaced relationship so as not 
to come into contact with each other wherein X is Sn or Ga 

and Z₃X is Nb₃Sn or V₃Ga, which is prepared according to 
an internal diffusion process from (1) a precursor wire 

comprising a Cu base metal matrix, a core of a base metal 
material X such as Sn arranged in the center portion of 

the wire and a multiplicity of filaments of a base metal 
material Z such as Nb arranged concentrically in layers 

around the core, in which the spacing between any adjacent 
filaments arranged in a boundary region of an ε -phase 

bronze layer having a certain radius from the center 
produced when the precursor is preheat-treated at a 

temperature of 300° to 600°C is made larger than the 
spacing between any adjacent filaments arranged in the 

other matrix regions so that the filaments do not come 
into contact with each other when heat-treated to convert 

the precursor into a superconducting wire; or (2) a 
precursor wire wherein a composite of a Cu base metal 

material and a base metal material X capable of forming an 
alloy with the Cu base metal material is used as a matrix 

without arranging a core of the base metal material X at 
the center, and a multiplicity of filaments of a base 

metal material Z are embedded in the composite in a spaced 
relationship. Since the filaments are prevented from 

contacting each other in the heat treatment step, the 
effective filament diameter is remarkably decreased, thus 

hysteresis loss is decreased to improve the stability of 
superconducting coils, and also the critical current 

density Jc and uniformity of the wire are improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a compound
superconducting wire suitable for use in superconducting
magnets of high magnetic field and a method for
manufacturing the same. Particularly, the present
invention is advantageously applicable to an Nb-Sn
compound superconducting wire and a manufacturing method
therefor.The term "precursor of superconducting wire" or
"superconducting wire precursor" as used herein means a
wire prior to undergoing a heat treatment, i.e., a wire
prior to being imparted with a superconductivity. The
heat treated precursor to impart a superconductivity,
namely the wire converted into superconductor by the heat
treatment, is termed a "superconducting wire".Hitherto, superconducting wires have been
manufactured by a method so-called "internal diffusion
method".The WO-A-91/04583 discloses a compound superconducting wire
comprising, after a heat-treatment diffusion reaction, at least
one filament of Nb3Sn in a bronze matrix wherein said Nb3Sn is
produced in situ by the diffusion of a Sn-Mg eutectic into the
locus of niobium-containing filaments located in a copper
matrix.An Nb3Sn superconducting wire prepared by the
internal tin diffusion method is also known from
Japanese Patent Publication Kokoku No. 16141/1986. Figs.
10 and 11 are explanatory sectional views respectively
illustrating an Nb3Sn superconducting wire precursor prior
to undergoing a heat treatment according to a conventional
internal diffusion method described in Japanese Patent
Publication Kokoku No. 16141/1986 and an Nb3Sn
superconducting wire after undergoing the heat treatment.
In Fig. 10, denoted at numeral 41 is the superconducting
wire precursor prior to the heat treatment, at numeral
43 Nb base metal filaments to be converted into a
superconductor by the heat treatment, at numeral 44
barrier layer such as made of Ta, at numeral 45
stabilizing layer such as made of oxygen free copper, at
numeral 46 Cu base metal material, and at numeral 47 Sn
base metal material. In Fig. 11, denoted at numeral 48 is  
the superconducting wire after the heat treatment, at
numeral 49 Nb3Sn filaments having a superconductivity, and
at numeral 50 low-Sn-concentration bronze.The superconducting wire 48 is obtained by
subjecting the superconducting wire precursor 41 to a heat
treatment at a high temperature (typically ranging from
600° to 800°C ) to produce an Nb3Sn compound in the Nb
filaments 43.The conventional method for manufacturing an
Nb3Sn superconducting wire using the internal diffusion
method is as follows. First, an Nb
