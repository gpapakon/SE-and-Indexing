<ABSTRACT>
An electrostatographic single-pass multiple station 
multi-colour printer for forming an image onto a web is 

described. The printer comprises a plurality of toner 
image-printing electrostatographic stations (A, B, C, D). 

Each station has a drum onto the surface (26) of which a 
toner image can be formed. An exposure station (30) 

forms an electrostatic toner image line-wise on each drum 
surface. A corona device (34) transfers the toner image 

onto the web (12), which is conveyed in succession past 
said stations (A, B, C, D) in synchronism with the 

rotation of the drum surface (26). Register control 
means are provided for controlling the operation of each 

of said stations in timed relationship thereby to obtain 
correct registering of the distinct toner images on the 

web (12). The register control means comprises an 
encoder (60) driven by the displacement of the web to 

produce pulses indicative of web displacement, and delay 
means (71) arranged to initiate the operation of 

subsequent stations after a predetermined web 
displacement, as measured by the encoder means, has 

occurred. The invention enables accurate registration 
of the transferred images, irrespective of the speed of 

the paper web through the printer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrostatographic single-pass
multiple station (for example multi-colour) printer,
in particular such a printer as is capable of printing
colour images for professional purposes as a cost
effective alternative to conventional printing of short
to medium sized runs.Electrostatographic printing operates according to the
principles and embodiments of non-impact printing as
described, eg, in "Principles of Non-Impact Printing" by
Jerome L Johnson (1986) - Palatino Press - Irvine CA,
92715 USA).Electrostatographic printing includes electrographic
printing in which an electrostatic charge is deposited
image-wise on a dielectric recording member as well as
electrophotographic printing in which an overall
electrostatically charged photoconductive dielectric
recording member is image-wise exposed to conductivity
increasing radiation producing thereby a "direct" or
"reversal" toner-developable charge pattern on said
recording member. Magnetic brush development is suited
for "direct" as well as "reversal" development.
"Direct" development is a positive-positive development,
and is particularly useful for reproducing pictures
rather than text. "Reversal" development is of interest 
in or when from a negative original a positive
reproduction has to be made or vice-versa, or when the
exposure derives from an image in digital electrical
signal form, wherein the electrical signals modulate a
laser beam or the light output of light-emitting diodes
(LEDs). It is advantageous with respect to a reduced
load of the electric signal modulated light source (laser
or LEDs) to record graphic information (eg printed text)
in such a way that the light information corresponds with
the graphic characters so that by "reversal" development
in the exposed area of a photoconductive recording layer,
toner can be deposited to produce a positive reproduction
of the electronically stored original. In high speed
electrostatographic printing the exposure derives
practically always from electronically stored, ie
computer stored, information.As used herein, the term "electrostatographic" also
includes the direct image-wise application of
electrostatic charges on an insulating support, for
example by ionography.The toner image obtained on a repeatedly used
electrostatographic dielectric recording member is
transferred onto a printing stock material, usually
paper, in the form of a web whereon the toner image is
fixed, whereupon the web is usually cut into sheets
containing the desired print frame.The printing
