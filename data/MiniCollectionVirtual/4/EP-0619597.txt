<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an ionisation chamber for the detection of gamma  radiation, including:   - an enclosure (1) made of aluminium and of lead and filled with argon under a pressure of 5 to 10 bar, and - two electrodes (3,4) located inside the enclosure, these electrodes being electrically insulated and separated from each other in order to create an electric field (E) between them and allow the passage, through this electric field, of ionising particles which produce ions which can be collected via the said electrodes.   Application to nuclear reactors and to nuclear fuel reprocessing plants.

<CLAIMS>
Ionization chamber for the detection of gamma radiation comprising a 
gas-filled enclosure (1) and two electrodes (3, 4) positioned within the 

enclosure, said electrodes being electrically insulated and separated 
from one another in order to create an electric field (E) between them 

and permit the passage, into said electric field, of ionizing particles 
producing ions which can be collected by the said electrodes, characterized 

in that the gas filling the enclosure is argon, which is raised to a 
pressure between 5 and 10 bars. 
Ionization chamber according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
enclosure has a wall made from aluminium. 
Ionization chamber according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
inner face (2) of the wall is covered with a lead layer.
