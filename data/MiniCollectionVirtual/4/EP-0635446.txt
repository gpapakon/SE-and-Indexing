<ABSTRACT>
A reloadable dispenser 9 has a housing 10 for a foil roll, the said housing being mounted pivotably and removably on a holder 1. Mounted on the housing 10 is a plate 26 which assumes a horizontal position during the pivoting of the dispenser into the position of use and which then forms a supporting surface for an article to be covered or wrapped in the foil. By means of a severing device 20 which is mounted pivotably on the housing 10 and which is displaceable on a rod 23 extending parallel to the housing 10, the foil portion required can be detached. In the pivoted-in position of non-use of the dispenser, the plate 26 covers the front side of the holder 1.
