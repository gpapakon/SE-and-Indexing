<ABSTRACT>
A composite article is formed from yarn, comprising high strength fibres and fusible blocking material, and outer fusible material. The yarn is formed into its required shape and placed in a mould. The outer fusible material is introduced into the mould and its temperature is raised so as to melt the lower-melt temperature blocking fibres of the yarn. Under the action of temperature and pressure in the mould, the blocking material fuses so as to fill any interstices between the strength fibres, and the yarn is enclosed within the outer fusible material. The method is useful for forming electrical insulators of high strength glass fibre in the form of a loop (4) blocked against flow of moisture by polypropylene and enclosed within non-tracking polyethylene electrically insulating material (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of making composite, for example electrically 
insulating, articles, including electrical insulators per se, and in particular 
to reinforced polymeric insulators. Although the invention is preferably concerned with articles that 
perform a solely insulating function, and the ensuring description, for 
convenience, will relate mainly thereto, it is to be understood that in 
general the composite, for example, electrically insulating articles may 
also or alternatively perform other functions. Thus, the article may be a 
surge arrester, which for most of its time acts as an insulator but which, 
on the application of an over-voltage thereto, becomes conducting, in order 
to divert a surge of electrical power, from a lightning strike on associated 
electrical equipment for example, to earth. Broadly, however, the 
invention relates to composite articles whether electrically insulating or 
conductive. Electrical insulators for use at voltages in excess of about 1kV, and 
typically at 24kV, can be formed from (i) porcelain, which has good 
electrical properties but is heavy and brittle, thus having low resistance to 
vandalism; (ii) glass fibre rod impregnated with an epoxy resin, which is of 
lighter weight but generally has inferior electrical performance to 
porcelain in outdoor applications, or must be environmentally sealed; or 
(iii) solid polymeric material, which combines the advantages of light 
weight and good electrical performance but has poorer load bearing 
properties. Furthermore, polymeric tubing and/or sheds (annular 
extensions) may be added to porcelain or glass fibre rods, or incorporated 
into polymeric insulator, for enhanced performance. Reference is hereby  
 
made to GB-A-1 292 276, US-A-4 045 604, GB-A-1 530 994, GB-A-1 530 
995 and EP-A-0 253 622 (all to Raychem) and to GB-A-1 313 609 (BICC) 
for examples of such insulators and components. One disadvantage of the use of glass (or other) fibre in the 
construction of an insulator is the possibility of moisture wicking along 
the fibre and thus providing an electrical short circuit between the 
terminals, usually one at each end, of the insulator that make electrical 
connection therewith. Such material however can provide high 
mechanical strength. In general, it is an object of the present invention to provide a 
method of making a composite article of high strength that contains fibres, 
in such a way as to avoid, or at least reduce, the risk of moisture flowing 
along the fibres. It is

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a composite article, the article comprising yarn (24) 
enclosed within outer fusible material (6,26,46,64,76,96), wherein 


(i) the yarn (24), comprising a high strength fibre and fusible blocking 
material,
 is disposed in a mould, and 
(ii) the outer fusible material (6,26,46,64,76,96) is introduced into the mould in a molten 
state, the temperature of the outer fusible material (6,26,46,64,76,96) being at least 

equal to, and preferably above, the temperature at which the 
blocking material fuses,thereby to cause the blocking material 

to melt and flow between and around the strength fibres of the 
yarn (24) so as completely to enclose the fibres therewithin, and 

such that the blocked yarn is completely enclosed within the 
outer fusible material (6,26,46,64,76,96). 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the outer fusible (6,26,46,64,76,96) and/or the 
blocking material comprises a thermoplastic or a curable material, 

preferably polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, polymethylmethacrylate, 
polyethylene, silicone, polyethyleneteraphthalate, 

polybutyleneteraphthalate, ethylene-vinyl-acetate co-polymer, or low 
strength glass. 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the yarn (24) 
comprises high strength fibres of glass, carbon or aramid. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
outer fusible material (6,26,46,64,76,96) is electrically insulating and is substantially non-tracking, 

in accordance with ASTM D2303. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
blocking material comprises fibres that are wrapped around or interwoven 

with the high strength fibres of the yarn (24).  
 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
yarn (24) is tensioned into a loop (4,30,44,54,60,62,70,80,82,94) that is wound one or more times around two 

spaced-apart support members (2,20,22,32,42,50,72,74,78,84,86,88,92) before being introduced into the mould. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the yarn (24) is 
disposed uni-directionally or multi-directionally so as to form a rod or a 

tube. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
article is formed as an elongate electrical insulator, the yarn (24) is 

substantially non-conductive, and the support members serve as load-bearing 
members for connecting the insulator into an electrical circuit. 
A method according to claim 8, wherein the insulator contains one or 
more varistor blocks (40,56), thereby to function also as a surge arrester. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the 
mould is evacuated subsequent to the disposal therein of the yarn (24) and prior 

to the introduction of the outer fusible material (6,26,46,64,76,96). 
An electrically insulating article, including an insulator or a surge
