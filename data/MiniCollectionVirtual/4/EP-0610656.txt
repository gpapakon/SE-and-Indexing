<ABSTRACT>
An outer member (30) of a picture frame (10) surrounds a window opening (22) together with the pattern, picture (20) or the like visible therein, is itself a carrier of pattern or picture information associated with the latter and consists of flat material, such as photographic paper, cardboard, etc., which is firmly joined to a frame member (12), e.g. is laminated on. The picture-in-picture effect produced is intensified if the outer member (30) protrudes over the window opening (22) in each direction at least by half the width of the latter. A cutout (14; 24) of the frame member (12), which cutout is capable of holding glazing (18) on a stepped peripheral edge (16; 26), is somewhat larger than the window opening (22), the contour of which, in particular, is geometrically similar to the outer edge (36) of the outer member (30). Rebates (38; 40) at the edges (36, 22) engage over a lower plate (34) or the glazing (18), which is able to cover the pattern, picture (20) or the like which is preferably supported on a rear wall (28).
