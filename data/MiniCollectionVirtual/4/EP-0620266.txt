<ABSTRACT>
Reactive S (e.g. H₂S and mercaptans) in petroleum 
liquid are scavenged by the use of oil soluble trialkyl 

hexahydro triazines wherein at least one alkyl group, and 
preferably all three, contain from 7 to 20 carbon atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the treatment of a hydrocarbon 
liquid such as crude oil or refined products to remove 
hydrogen sulfide and/or mercaptans therefrom. In an important 
aspect of the invention, the treatment involves the use of oil 
soluble amine scavengers. In another aspect, the invention relates 
to the use of nonregenerative scavengers to reduce the levels of 
H₂S and mercaptans in hydrocarbon liquid, particularly water-free 
hydrocarbon liquids. Many crude oils and condensates contain naturally occurring 
components such as acid gases and mercaptans which must be removed 
or neutralized at some point in the producing, storage, or refining 
operations. The toxicity of hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans in 
hydrocarbon streams is well known in the industry and considerable 
expense and efforts are expended annually to reduce its content to 
a safe level. Many pipeline and storage regulations require pipeline 
hydrocarbon liquid to contain less than 4 ppm hydrogen 
sulfide. Some refined oils also contain reactive S such as H₂S and 
mercaptans and must be treated to lower the levels of their toxic 
substances. Based on an article appearing in the Oil & Gas Journal, January 
30, 1989, nonregenerative scavengers for small plant hydrogen  
 
sulfide removal fall into four groups: aldehyde based, metallic 
oxide based, caustic based, and other processes. In the removal 
of hydrogen sulfide by nonregenerative compounds, the scavenger 
reacts with the hydrogen sulfide to form a nontoxic compound or a 
compound which can be removed from the hydrocarbon. As indicated 
above, the compounds useful in the method of the present invention 
are aldehyde type scavengers, specifically oil soluble scavengers. Many of the aldehyde based scavengers form water soluble 
reaction products with H₂S, requiring the presence of water. For 
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,978,512 discloses an H₂S scavenger comprising 
the reaction product of an alkanol amine comprising 1 to 
6 carbon atoms with an aldehyde containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms. 
The reaction product forms a water-soluble lower alkyl hexahydro 
triazine, since the lower alkyl groups impart water solubility to 
the triazine. U.S. Patent No. 4,748,011 discloses an H₂S scavenger 
for natural gas comprising an aldehyde (e.g. formaldehyde), a lower 
alkyl amine inhibitor and water (20-80%). Oil soluble scavengers and suppressants are disclosed in the 
following patents and published applications: 
(a) U. S. Patent 2,783,205 discloses an acidic gas evolution 
suppres
