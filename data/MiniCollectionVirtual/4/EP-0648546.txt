<CLAIMS>
Device for separating fruits (10) from the waste
matter (14) situated among them, containing a sorting

element (2) in the shape of a riddle, the top side of
which is relief-shaped, whereby said sorting element (2)

consists of a number of elongated elements (3) formed of
laths set on edge with top ribs (6, 7, 8) situated at

different heights, whereby these elongated elements (3)
are arranged one next to the other, such that grooves (4)

are formed between them, characterized in that these
grooves (4) between the elongated elements (3) have a

free passage from top to bottom.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
sorting element (2) is made in the shape of a vibrating

screen.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the above-mentioned elongated elements (3) are made

and/or mounted such that the heights of the top ribs (6,
7, 8) alternate according to a repetitive pattern that is

designed such that, in its transverse section, the
highest top ribs (6) come back every four elongated

elements (3), in that, in the centre, between the
elements (3) with the highest top ribs (6), are situated

elements with a lower top rib (7), in that between the
elements (3) with one of the above-mentioned top ribs (6,

7) are situated elements (3) containing a top rib (8)
which is lower than the top ribs (6, 7) mentioned in the

first place.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the grooves (4) diverge in the

longitudinal direction of the elongated elements (3).
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the grooves (4) diverge downwards.
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the average width of the grooves

(4) is 1 to 3 cm.
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the largest difference in height

between the top ribs of the elongated elements (3) is 1
to 5 cm.
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a collecting element (11) is

provided under the sorting element (2).
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the top side of the collecting

element (2) is mounted slantingly.
