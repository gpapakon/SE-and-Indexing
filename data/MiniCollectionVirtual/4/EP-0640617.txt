<DESCRIPTION>
Tricyclic lactams having a mercaptoalkanoyl
sidechain and Possessing ACE and enkephalinase
inhibition activity are disclosed in EP 481,522 and
EP 534,363.Tricyclic lactams having a carboxyalkanoyl
or carboxyalkyl sidechain and possessing ACE and
enkephalinase inhibition activity are disclosed in
EP 249,223, EP 492,369, EP 534,396 and EP 534,492.Fused lactam containing ACE inhibitors
are disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,584,294 and 4,873,235.This invention is directed to novel 4-substituted-5-oxo-1H-azepino[2,1-a]isoquinoline-7-carboxylic acids which possess angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibition activity and some of
which also possess neutral endopeptidase inhibitory
activity. This invention is also directed to
pharmaceutical compositions containing such selective
or dual action inhibitors and the use of such
compounds for manufacturing a medicament. This
invention is also directed to the process for preparing
such novel compounds and novel intermediates.The novel 4-substicuted-5-oxo-1H-azepino[2,
1-al]isoquinoline-7-carboxylic acids of
this invention include those of the formula
 
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof
wherein
R2 is hydrogen or
The compounds of formula I
can be prepared by coupling the acylmercapto
containing sidechain of the formula

with an azepino[2,1-a]isoquinoline of the formula
 
to give the product of the formula

wherein R3 is an easily removable ester protecting
group such as methyl, ethyl,t-butyl, or benzyl. The
above reaction can be performed in an organic solvent
such as methylene chloride and in the presence of a
coupling reagent such as 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide,
dicylcohexylcarbodiimide,
benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium
hexafluorophosphate, or carbodiimidazole.
Alternatively, the acylmercapto carboxylic acid of
formula II can be converted to an activated form
prior to coupling such as an acid chloride, mixed
anhydride, symmetrical anhydride, activated ester,
etc.The product of formula IV can be converted to
the mercaptan product of formula I wherein R2 is
hydrogen by methods known in the
art. For example, when R6 is methyl and R3 is methyl
or ethyl treatment with methanolic sodium hydroxide
yields the products wherein R2 is hydrogen.The products of formula I wherein R2 is
hydrogen can be acylated with an acyl halide of the
formula 

wherein halo is F, Cl or Br or acylated with an
anhydride of the formula

to give other products of formula I wherein R2 is
The acylmercapto sidechain compounds of
formula II are described in
