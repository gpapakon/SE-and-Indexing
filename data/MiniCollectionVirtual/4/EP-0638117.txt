<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an improved lubricating oil composition for automotive internal combustion engines and transmission which comprises an oil of lubricating viscosity having admixed therewith a minor amount of friction modifier composition which reduces the coeffficient of friction between moving mechanical parts, thereby providing for enhanced fuel economy. The friction modifier composition comprises a combination of an alkoxylated hydrocarbyl amine or a boronated derivative thereof and dydrocarbyl phenol sulfide. This combination of components provides for synergistic fuel economy effects particularly when used as components in automotive crankcase lubricants also containing conventional additive packages, which effects are not observed in oil which contains one or the other of these components alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
LUBRICANT COMPOSITION CONTAINING MIXED FRICTION MODIFIERSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to lubricaring oil compositions which exhibit enhanced fuel economy and which contain a minor amount of the friction modifier combination of an alkylated phenol sulfide and an alkoxylated hydrocarbyl amine.2. Description cf Related ArtIt is an objective of the automotive and oil industry to provide lubricating oil compositions which exhibit improvements in fuel savings in gasoline and diesel engine vehicles. In order to meet these goals, additives have been developed for crankcase and transmission oils which significantly reduce friction between engine or transmission moving parts, which reduction translates into improved mileage per volume of fuel consumed by an internal combustion engine. Because modern day lubricating oil compositions are complex formulations, such additives must be compatible with other components present in the cil and should not adversely affect the numerous ether functions of conventional lubricant additives such asSUBSTITUTESHEET 

dispersancy, viscosity stability , corrosion, oxidation inhibition and the like.__«Representative examples of known oil additive modifiers are found in U.S. Patent No. 3,933,559 which discloses fatty acid esters and amides; U.S. Patent No. 4 ,176,074 which describes molybdenum complexes of polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride- mino alkanols; U.S. Patent 4,105,571 which discloses glycerol esters of dimerized fatty acids; U.S. Patent No. 3,779,928 which discloses alkane phosphonic acid salts; U.S. Patent No. 3,778,375 which discloses reaction products of a phosphonate and oleamide; U.S. Patent No. 3,352,215 which discloses S-carboxy-alkylene hydrocarbyl succinimide, S-carboxyalkylene hydrocarbyl succinic acid and mixtures thereof; U.S. Patent 3,879,306 which discloses N-(hydroxy-alkyl) alkenyl-succinamic acids or succinimides; U.S. Patent No. 3,932,290 which discloses reaction products of di-(lower alkyl) phosphites and epσxideε; and U.S. Patent No. 4,028,258 which discloses the alkylene oxide adduct of phosphosulfurized N-(hydroxyalkyl) alkenyl succinimides.Another known category of friction modifiers includes alkoxylated hydrocarbyl mono or polyamines such as generally illustrated by formulas l and 2 below. These amines include materials such as N,N-bis(2-hydroxyalkyl) hydrocarbyl amines such as disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,711,406, 2,796,662, 3,533,659, 4,010,106, 4,129,508, 4,170,560, 4,231,883 and 4,795,583.SUBSTITUTESHEET

(2-hydroxyethyl) 
^
tallow amine at respective 0.5% by volume and 0.2% by volume levels as in Example 3, an EFEI test result of 2.65 is achieved which is superior to the actual EFEI value for this amine used alone at a 0.5% by volume concentration as in Example 2. In addition, since NFS used alone with the Control base formulation results in a dimunition of EFEI values, the recorded EFEI results are higher than might be expected.
Similar unexpected results are achieved when NPS is combined with N,N-bis (2-hydroxypropyl) tallow amine as shown in Example 5 and with boronated N,N-bis (2-hydroxyethyl) tallow amine as shown in Example 7.
Thus the inclusion of the hydrocarbyl phenol sulfides of the present invention, which exhibit no friction enhancing properties on their own, into lubricating oil formulations containing an alkoxylated amine friction modifier results in a significant and synergistic enhancement of the lubricating properties of the oil.
