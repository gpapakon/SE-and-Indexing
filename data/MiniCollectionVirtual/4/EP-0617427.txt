<ABSTRACT>
A cassette (30) having a leader portion (36) and 
recordable tape portion (34) which cleans the various 

components of the tape path in videocassette recorders 
by dry scrubbing. Interactive diagnostic and 

instructional material is recorded on the tape to 
instruct the operator about the cleaning operation to 

enable the operator to evaluate progress of the head 
cleaning operation, and to program the maintenance 

protocol of head cleaning cycles relative to capstan 
cleaning cycles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cleaning 
cassettes for cleaning the heads of videocassette 
recorders. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to cleaning cassettes for cleaning the heads 
of videocassette recorders without using a liquid. In magnetic recording, the recording medium, 
such as magnetic tape, must be maintained in intimate 
contact with the surface of the transducer, or "head," 
during the recording and playback processes. Even the 
smallest contaminants, such as airborne dust or smoke 
particles, can be of sufficient size to affect the 
head-to-tape spacing and to affect noticeably the 
overall quality of the recording and playback process, 
if the contaminants find their way into the region 
between the head and the tape. In addition, traces of 
the recording medium itself can adhere to the head, 
thereby building up a contaminant layer of sufficient 
thickness to cause noticeable deterioration of signal 
quality. Problems of contamination are especially 
acute in rotary head apparatus, such as videocassette 
recorders and camcorders. There is a need for systems 
to clean the head. There are several types of known head 
cleaners, including those which apply solvents by 
various ribbons or pads, and those which use dry 
scrubbing materials, carried, for example, on a 
magnetic recording tape. The term "dry scrubbing" 
refers to mechanical separation of contaminants from a 
surface by the action of a rough surface, called the 
scrubbing surface, sliding in contact with the surface  
 
to be cleaned. Roughness of the scrubbing surface can 
be produced by such methods as attaching particulates 
to a substrate, providing a fabric layer as the 
scrubbing surface, or by mechanically embossing a 
pattern into the scrubbing surface. While abrasive 
surfaces provide dry scrubbing, it is not necessarily 
desirable that the dry scrubbing surface be abrasive, 
because an overly abrasive surface could accelerate 
wear of the surfaces being cleaned. Despite the risk of accelerated wear, dry 
scrubbing materials which accomplish the cleaning 
operation without solvents have the advantage of 
greater safety than those which use solvents, since 
the use of solvents in a household environment, 
especially where children are present, can involve 
problems of toxicity, spilling, and irritating vapors. The risk of accelerated wear due to the use 
of dry scrubbing materials can be reduced by limiting 
the abrasiveness of the dry scrubbing material itself.

the head (16) while the tape (32) is driven to 

run by the capstan (18) of the recorder (10), 
wherein the cleaning tape (32) further carries 
scrubbing material at its back side (48) over 

the length of at least one section, whereby the 
cleaning tape (32) ensures the tape guides of 

the recorder to be cleaned by the scrubbing 
material carried at either or both of the front 

and back sides (46,52), regardless of whether 
each tape guide is facing the tape front side 

(46) or the tape back side (52),

comprises magnetic material having recorded 

video images and/or audio sounds to be played to 
convey information on at least the cleaning 

operation by the videocassette recorder (10),  
 
wherein diagnostic information and instructions 
for stopping the tape transport are conveyed 

from each of a plurality of segments 
(58,60,62,64) in a first portion of the tape and 

instructions to rewind the tape are conveyed 
from a segment (66) in a second portion of the 

tape after the last segment (64) in the first 
portion of the tape, and wherein during 

rewinding the cleaning of the capstan (18) is 
performed.
