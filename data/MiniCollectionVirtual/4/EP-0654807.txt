<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stacked cam switch, having a baseplate (10) on which at least one cam disc (22, 41), which is coupled to a switching shaft, for in each case one switch element (34, 44) is mounted such that it can rotate, in each case one driver disc (17, 40) being integrally formed between each cam disc (22, 41) and the switching shaft, which driver disc (17, 40) can be coupled in a rotationally fixed manner to the cam disc (22, 41) in different positions. The driver disc (17, 40) is coupled in a positively locking and rotationally fixed manner to the switching shaft so that the rotational movement of the switching shaft is transmitted via the driver disc (17, 40) to the cam disc (22, 41), and by the cam disc (22, 41) to the associated switching element (34, 44).

least one cam plate (21, 22, 93) coupled to a control
shaft, each for a switch element, and a driver plate (17,

40, 92), wherein the cam plate is coupled non-rotatably in
form-locking relationship by the driver plate to a control

shaft for the actuation of in each case one switch element,
characterised in that in the unit capable of preassembly

between each cam plate (21, 22, 93) and the control shaft
is mounted a driver plate (17, 40, 92) which can be coupled

non-rotatably to the cam plate in different relative
positions by means of an actuating element (29, 42, 94)

mounted adjustably in the unit capable of preassembly,
wherein the driver and cam plates (17, 40; 21, 22) are

arranged axially one above the other on an intermediate
plate (15) as an additional part of the unit capable of

preassembly.
Gang cam switch according to claim 1, characterised in
that the driver plate (17, 40) comprises an axially

projecting, cylinder-like ring (18, 40a) in the end face of
which are formed radially extending driver plate grooves

(25) distributed over the circumference, in that the cam
plate (22, 41) has cam plate grooves (19) aligned with the

radial grooves (25) in certain positions and also extending
radially, and in that there is provided a coupling slide

(29) which is radially displaceable so that in a first
position it engages in the grooves (25, 19) of both the cam

and the driver plates (17, 40) and in a second position it
is free from the grooves (19) of the driver plate (17, 40),

so that the cam plate (22, 41) is rotatable relative to the
driver plate (17, 40).
Gang cam switch according to claim 2, characterised in
that the coupling slide (29) can be pulled radially

outwards, wherein in the inner rest position (first 
position) it couples the cam and driver plates (22, 41; 71,

40) together and in the extended, second position it
releases them, or vice versa.
Gang cam switch according to claim 2 or 3, characterised
in that on the base plate (10) is integrally formed an

annular, axially projecting strip (16) in which the driver
plate (17) engages and so is guided.
Gang cam switch according to any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the cylindrical ring (18,

40a) of the driver plate (22) is surrounded by the cam
plate (17, 41) and centres and guides the latter.
Gang cam switch according to claim 1, characterised in
that the driver plate comprises latch recesses (98)

distributed over the circumference and in that on the cam
plate (93) which is guided in a recess of the driver plate

(92) is integrally formed a radially extending arm (94)
which springs in the axial direction and is capable of

bending up and on which is mounted a cam (97) which in the
rest state engages in one of the latch recesses (98) and

which is removable from this recess by bending of the arm
and after rotation of the cam plate (93) by a given angular

degree can be relatched in another latch recess (98).
Gang cam switch according to any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that on the unit furthest from the

base plate (10) is placed an end plate (45) which serves to
support and guide a switch mechanism (50; 53, 54).
Gang cam switch according to any of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the switch elements (34, 44)

are stacked one on top of the other on the base plate (10)
on one side of the cam plate (22...) and so their terminals

are accessible on only one side of the base plate (10).
Gang cam switch according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the cam plate (22...) and the
