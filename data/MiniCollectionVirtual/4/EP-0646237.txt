<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to compositions and methods of using clay-enclosed paramagnetic ions as image brightening or image contrast agents. In particular, T1 relaxivity measurements on Hectorite and mortmorillonite clay-enclosed trivalent gadolinium suggest improved imaging over zeolite-enclosed paramagnetic species. Clay-enclosed gadolinium complexes are amenable to convenient administration in oral preparations and are readily formulated in stable aqueous suspensions. Other transition metal ions, including divalent manganese, may be enclosed in the clay structures, either as free metals or in the forms of chelated complexes. Alternatively, improved relaxivities are envisioned for clays incorporating a paramagnetic metal ion as part of the frameword structure.

 DESCRIPTIONCLAY ENCLOSED TRANSITION AND RARE EARTH METAL IONS AS CONTRAST AGENTS FOR THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACTThis is a continuation-in-part of United States Serial No. 08/070,351 filed on May 27, 1993.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to contrast or imaging agents useful in vivo for studies and diagnosis of the gastrointestinal tract. The agents are molecular sieve materials enclosing a paramagnetic ion such as trivalent gadolinium. The loaded molecular sieves are particularly suitable for oral administration and function well as magnetic resonance imaging contrast or image brightening agents in the upper gastrointestinal tract.The availability of sophisticated methods such as MRI and CT has contributed to the increased use of imaging technology in therapy and diagnostic studies. Gastrointestinal tract imaging is a particular area of interest because currently used imaging agents generally provide poor imaging, resulting in visualization of little more than gross blockages or anatomical abnormalities.Barium sulfate and paramagnetic iron oxide are agents traditionally used for gastrointestinal studies. The latter material has become popular because of the paramagnetic properties of Fe203 which is suited for MRI studies, but it has many disadvantages. These include black bowel, side effects of diarrhea and, from an important analytical standpoint, the presence of 

artifacts arising from clumping. When paramagnetic iron concentrates, it may become ferromagnetic, drastically altering its imaging properties. Even when images are obtained, the signal is black, making -it difficult to distinguish imaged from nonimaged areas.The development of imaging contrast agents, particularly for gastrointestinal tract studies has been slow. Historically, the most popular agent has been superparamagnetic iron oxide for magnetic imaging, due to its nonbiodegradability. Although good contrast effects have been achieved in some MR studies in the small bowel, increasing occurrence of blurring and "metal" artifacts in the distal part of the bowel has been recorded (Lonnemark et al . , 1989) . In other studies with superparamagnetic iron oxide, good resolution of the head and tail of the pancreas, anterior margins of the kidneys and para-aortic region has been shown in human patients. However, there are undesirable side effects such as episodes of diarrhea in some patients (Hahn et al . , 1990) .Magnetic imaging is particularly useful for the study and diagnosis of tumors or inflammatory abdominal diseases.
