<ABSTRACT>
The sound quality of inputted 
signals is changed in accordance with 

the sense of hearing. The differences of 
magnitudes of an attribute between frequency 

components approximately in 
a critical band are based on auditory 

characteristics. The frequency components 
are obtained from acoustic time 

signal information. The characteristic 
of this acoustic time signal information 

is changed by one of the following 
techniques: (1) the differences of 

magnitudes of an attribute between frequency 
components above the threshold 

of audibility or masking threshold 
level among the frequency components 

are changed; (2) the differences of 
magnitudes of an attribute between frequency 

components above the higher 
one of the two thresholds are changed; 

(3) the differences of magnitudes of 
an attribute between frequency components 

in a limited range of level are 
changed: and the differences of magnitudes 

of an attribute between frequency 
components in the approximately critical 

band obtained from acoustic time 
signal information having a frequency 

resolution and a time resolution and 
containing at least two different frequency 

components are changed. In 
such a way, the harmonic relationship 

between the frequency components in the critical band which is audibly supported is controlled, thus making it possible 
to adjust the sound quality of speech and acoustic signals to the level usef
ul to a human being.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a signal transforming method and 
a signal transforming apparatus applied to, e.g., digital audio 
equipments and adapted for altering (changing) sound quality 
(i.e., transforming the characteristic of time signal 
information) by using particularly the property of the hearing 
sense with respect to an input audio signal which is a time 
signal, and a recording medium adapted so that information in 
which characteristic of time signal information is transformed 
by such method or apparatus is recorded thereonto or thereinto. Hitherto, as a technique for altering (changing) sound 
quality of acoustic (audible) signal information, there are used, 
e.g., a system of altering the frequency characteristic by 
filtering processing, a system for producing higher harmonic 
(wave), a system of altering (changing) dynamic range by so 
called compressor, and the like. However, in the case of the system using filter, how to use 
filter is changed e.g., a medium frequency band is enhanced to 
improve presence, etc., thus to change sound quality. In the 
system of producing higher harmonic (wave), use in a manner of 
sound effect is applied rather than sound easy to be heard is 
obtained. In addition, the system of changing (altering) dynamic  
 
range by compressor is a system such that big sound is not caused 
to be disagreeable to the ear, or soft sound is not caused to be 
masked by the ambient noise. With these systems, it is difficult 
to carry out optimum control such that sound agreeable to the ear 
is provided from a viewpoint of the hearing sense in a manner to 
cope with changes of acoustic signal information varying moment 
by moment. In view of actual circumstances as described above, this 
invention has been proposed, and its object is to provide a 
signal transforming method and a signal transforming apparatus 
capable of transforming speech and acoustic signals significant 
with respect to sound quality from a viewpoint of the hearing 
sense of the human being, and a recording medium adapted so that 
speech or acoustic signal information of which characteristic is 
transformed by the above-mentioned method or apparatus is 
recorded thereonto or thereinto. Namely, the task that this invention contemplates solving 
is to provide an technique for implementing a predetermined 
transform processing to acoustic signal information to create 
sound which can be heard agreeably with high quality from a 
viewpoint of sound quality for the human being moment by moment 
by using the
