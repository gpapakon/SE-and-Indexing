<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to masonrywork having a plurality of courses, arranged one above the other and offset with respect to one another along the masonry wall line, of masonry blocks (1) which, in the interior, exhibit clearances (4) which pass through vertically and are intended for receiving connecting elements. For the simple and rapid erection of a homogeneous wall structure with improved heat insulation, the connecting elements are insert blocks which are offset vertically, by essentially half the height of the masonry block, with respect to the masonry-block courses and engage in a positively locking manner, by means of their upper section, into the inner clearances of the masonry blocks located thereabove.
