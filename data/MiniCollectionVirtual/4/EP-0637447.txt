<ABSTRACT>
There is provided with an orally administrable 
cholesterol lowering agent which is obtained by coating with 

hydroxypropylmethylcellulose plain tablets containing an 
anion exchange resin as an active component and containing 

14-20% by weight of water and not more than 2% by weight of 
silicon dioxide based on the weight of the anion exchange 

resin. The orally administrable cholesterol lowering agent 
is obtained by coating the above mentioned tablets with an 

aqueous solution of 10-30 cSt of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. 
In addition to being characterized by the easiness of 
swallowing, the orally administrable cholesterol lowering 

agent of the present invention is superior in the compressing 
shapability, stability in a moistening environment, and 

fluidity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an orally
administrable cholesterol lowering agent and, more
particularly, to an orally administrable cholesterol lowering
agent which is superior in compressing shapability, stability
under a moistening environment, and fluidity together with an
easiness of swallowing.Conventionally, anion exchange resins are large in
dose and hence tablets become large. Considering
swallowability, capsule-shaped tablets are preferable. For
the capsule-shaped tablets, however, a part of a punch may be
deformed upon compressing unlike circular tablets, and the
punch is more likely to be broken. In methods of compressing
with a certain volume of water contained that are
conventionally made (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open
Nos. 2-286621 and 3-236326), a larger compressing pressure is
required and are thus insufficient as methods of preparing
plain tablets.On the other hand, regarding to coating of tablets
containing an anion exchange resin as an active component,
such a method is known that uses cholestyramin resin and
dissolves with heat stearic acid into polyethylene glycol for
coating without using a solvent (Japanese Patent Application 
Laid-Open No. 3-236326). Tablets coated by this method are, however, inferior in
storage stability in an open condition. The tablets are hygroscopically disintegrated
in several hours at room temperature. Accordingly, the tablets have only a poor stability
after the packaging is opened. In addition, a coating layer has a low strength
and is greatly worn. The tablets may thus be broken in a packaging process or during
transportation.GB-A-1 573 487 relates to a bile acid binding composition in unit dosage form
for the purpose of increasing bile acid excretion which comprises calcium carbonate
and cholestyramine. Example 3 discloses the preparation of a tablet which is coated
with hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.WO-A-93 00 915 relates to a formulation of Colestipol and a process for making
it, wherein colloidal silicon dioxide is added as an excipient, together with povidone
and magnesium stearate.EP-A-497 985 relates to a cellulose ether such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
having high whiteness and a low degree of polymerization to be used as a base
for film-coating pharmaceuticals.Commercially available cholestyramins are dry syrups dissolved on use and
are desired to be formed into tablets considering the easiness of swallowing and
handling.
Favorable tablets have not been obtained yet because of the above-mentioned reasons.The present inventors
