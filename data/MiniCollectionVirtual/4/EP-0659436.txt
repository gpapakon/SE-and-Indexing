<ABSTRACT>
A potentiator for interferon and an antiviral activity-potentiating 
composition containing interferon and its potentiator 

are provided. The potentiator is selected from flavin 
adenine dinucleotide (FAD); a mixture of FAD and porcine liver 

extract; flavin adenine mononucleotide (FAM); riboflavin; or a 
mixture thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a potentiator for interferon 
and an antiviral activity-potentiating composition comprising 
interferon and its potentiator. The term "interferon" (hereinafter also refers to as 
"IFN") has been adopted to refer to the generic name for glyco-proteins 
which are produced and secreted by animal cells infected 
with virus, and the like. Interferons are classified into three types. Type α is induced 
in leukocyte by virus infection or nucleic acid treatment. 
Type β is induced by a similar fibroblast and has a structure 
similar to that in type α. Type γ is induced in lymphocyte by 
stimulation with specific antigens or mitogen and thus said as 
"immune interferon". Interferons can be extracted from natural 
materials, or produced by a genetic recombination technique with 
the aid of animal cells or E. coli, and has been marketed under 
Trademarks of "Feron", "Sumiferon", "Canferon", "Roferon", 
"Intron", and the like. Although human interferons are used as a tumor-treating 
drug, they are also utilized as a drug for treating chronic 
viral hepatitis B and C; however, the efficacy of interferons 
for treating chronic hepatitis B is unsatisfactory, and the rate 
of efficacy is at most 30 % in the case of chronic hepatitis C. 
In addition, human interferons are too expensive, and restrictions 
on their use are under discussion from the viewpoint of 
reduction in medical expenses for treating such chronic 
hepatitis. On the other hand, the present applicant company has 
marketed a composition as a hepatitis-treating drug under the 
trademark "Adelavin No. 9" which comprises 15µl/ml of porcine 
liver extract and 10mg/ml of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD).  
 
The "Adelavin No. 9" has been marketed for the purpose of 
protecting the liver, but the potentiating effect on the antiviral 
activity of interferon has been unknown. A report has been issued on the potentiating activity of 
FAD, which is one of components of "Adelavin No. 9", on the 
anti-vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) activity of POLYr(A-U) 
which is one of interferon inducers ["Cell Biol. Int. Rep.", 
Vol. 13, pages 215 - 222 (1989)]. In addition, as reported in 
"Agric. Biol. Chem.", Vol. 149, No. 6, pages 1881 - 1883 (1985), 
riboflavin (vitamin B₂) which constitutes a part of the structure 
for FAD and liver extract have been shown to exhibit an antiviral 
action [WO 92/17173(A) and FP 2,676,648]; however, the 
effect of them on the antiviral action of interferon has not 
been investigated. In addition to the
