<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for performing dark signal correction 
on a photoelectric conversion device. A flow of light to the 

device is alternately conducted and interrupted (103). The 
device generates an intermixed signal (104) while the flow of 

light is conducted to the device, the intermixed signal including 
a desired signal intermixed with an unwanted dark signal. The 

device generates a dark signal alone (105) while the flow of 
light to the device is interrupted. The dark signal alone is 

filtered (106) to produce a filtered dark signal. The filtered 
dark signal is subtracted (107) from the intermixed signal to 

produce a corrected signal, which is representative of the 
desired signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to a method and apparatus for dark signal correction, 
and more particularly to a method and apparatus for correcting an unwanted dark signal of a photoelectric 
conversion device employed in spectrographic analysis of gaseous substances. Instrumentation that analyzes gaseous substances is required in a variety of important applications. 
For example, during a surgical operation, patients are anesthetized through the careful administration of 
gases. The supply of these anesthetics must be regulated with great precision. In addition, the gases 
expelled in the patient's breath need to be monitored continuously to determine the condition of the patient. 
Instrumentation that analyzes gases exhaled by patients provide vital information to surgical personnel. A particular class of instrumentation employs Raman spectroscopy to detect the presence and 
concentration of gaseous substances. Scattering of light by the Raman effect has received much attention 
from scientists since its original exposition by C.V. Raman in 1928. Instrumentation that employs the Raman 
effect provides a light, such as a laser beam, which illuminates molecules of a gas disposed within a sampling 
cell. Molecular vibrations of the gas cause the light to scatter off the illuminated gas molecules to produce 
scattered light in a process which shifts the frequency of the scattered light by exactly the vibrational 
frequency of the molecule. The frequency shift of the spectral signal is characteristic of the gas being 
analyzed and is independent of the frequency of the illuminating light. Thus, the Raman scattered light can 
be used to infer properties of the gas being analyzed, such as chemical composition and concentration. The Raman scattered light is collected from the gas disposed within the sampling cell and 
constituent frequency components of the light are analyzed and detected. The analyzed frequency 
components are used to produce a spectrogram, which can be displayed on a display device. By interpreting 
the spectrogram, the presence and concentration of different types of constituent gas molecules in the gas 
can be deduced. Though the Raman effect can be employed to provide a powerful analytical tool, it should 
be noted that in general, intensity of the light produced by the Raman effect is extremely weak. The Raman 
scattered light has an extremely low intensity relative to intensity of radiation used to stimulate the effect. Instrumentation that employs the Raman effect is
