<ABSTRACT>
A flexible electrostatographic imaging belt comprising a support layer, a coating 
including a film forming polymer, and a 
permanent skewed seam The electrostatographic 
imaging belt may be fabricated by providing a sheet having a parallelogram shape with slanted 

ends, the sheet having a first malor exterior surface opposite and parallel to a second major 
exterior surface, overlapping an edge (12) of the first major exterior surface adjacent a first of 

the slanted ends onto an edge (14) of the second major exterior surface of adjacent a second 
slanted of the ends to form a skewed seam, and securing the ends to each other to form a 

permanent skewed seam. This skewed seam electrostatographic imaging belt may be used in 
an electrostatographic imaging process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to flexible belts, and more specifically, to flexible 
electrostatographic imaging belts and to methods for fabricating such belts. Flexible belts, such as electrostatographic imaging members, are well known. Typical 
electrostatographic flexible imaging members include, for example, photoreceptors for 
electrophotographic imaging systems, and electroreceptors or ionographic imaging members 
for electrographic imaging systems Electrostatographic imaging member belts typically have a 
welded seam. For electrophotographic applications, the imaging members preferably 
comprise a flexible substrate coated with one or more layers of photoconductive material. The 
substrates are usually organic materials such as a film forming polymer. The photoconductive 
coatings applied to these substrates may comprise inorganic materials such as selenium or 
selenium alloys, organic materials, or combinations of organic and inorganic materials. The 
organic photoconductive layers may comprise, for example, a single binder layer or multilayers 
comprising, for example, a charge generating layer and a charge transport layer. The charge 
generating layer is capable of photogenerating holes and injecting the photogenerated holes 
into the charge transport layer. The basic process for using electrostatographic flexible 
imaging members is well known in the art. As more advanced, higher speed electrophotographic copiers, duplicators and 
printers were developed, degradation of image quality was encountered during extended 
cycling. Moreover, complex, highly sophisticated duplicating and printing systems operating at 
very high speeds have placed stringent requirements including narrow operating limits on 
photoreceptors. For example, the numerous layers found in many modern photoconductive 
imaging members must be highly flexible, adhere well to adjacent layers, and exhibit 
predictable electrical characteristics within narrow operating limits to provide excellent toner 
images over many thousands of cycles. One typical type of multilayered imaging member that 
has been employed as a belt in electrophotographic imaging systems is a photoreceptor 
comprising a supporting substrate, a conductive layer, a hole blocking layer, an adhesive layer, 
a charge generating layer, a charge transport layer, a conductive ground strip layer adjacent to 
one edge of the imaging layers, and an anti-curl back coating at the back side of the supporting 
substrate opposite to the electrophotographic active layers.
