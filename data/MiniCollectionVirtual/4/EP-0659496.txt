<ABSTRACT>
A die (1) has a thin rod-shaped mandrel (2) tightly 
surrounded by the segments (11) of a gripper (3), the 

mandrel (2) being placed in the axial bore (5) of a 
mandrel holder (4). The inner peripheral surface of 

the axial bore (5) is shrinkage-fitted or otherwise 
fixedly fitted on outer peripheral surfaces of the gripping 

segments (11), thereby urging them to keep the thin 
rod-shaped mandrel (2) in place in the holder (4). The 

mandrel can have an extremely fine orifice forming end 
(9) of a diameter of 3 mm or less, such an fine can be 

prepared easily and precisely, and maintenance of the die 
can be done inexpensively when the orifice forming end 

will have been worn out or damaged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a die for extruding
elongate articles made of a metal such as aluminum and
having longitudinal orifices.An example of the prior art dies 71 is shown in Fig.
10, which has been used to extrude elongate articles 'E'
of aluminum or the like metal and each having a longitudinal
orifice 'h' as shown in Fig. 9A, 9B or 9C.This die 71 of the port-hole type is an die assembly
consisting of a male die 72 and a female die 73 combined
therewith. The male die 72 has an orifice former 74
needle-shaped and protruding forwards. This orifice
former 74 integral with the male die is to be located
within a forming hole 75 of the female die 73 combined
with the male die 72. The extrudate 'E' extruded
through this die 71 will have an outer periphery corresponding
to the inner periphery of the forming hole 75 of
the female die 73, with the orifice former 74 thereby
producing the longitudinal orifice 'h' extending through
the extrudate.However, it has not been easy even for the electrospark
machining to make such an orifice former 74 integral 
with the male die 72 in those prior art dies, especially
where said former 74 must be of high precision in
shape and dimension.It has been almost impossible to prepare a highly
precise orifice former 74 that could form an extremely
thin orifice 'h' having a diameter for example of 3 mm or
less.Further, it has been another problem that a male die
72 must be replaced entirely with a new one even when
only the orifice former 74 would be worn.A prior art die as defined in the preamble of Claim 1 is known
from US-A-2964178.An object of the present invention made in view of
drawbacks of the prior art is to provide a die of a novel
type for extruding elongate articles having longitudinal
orifices, wherein the die of novel type can comprise
without any difficulty a fine orifice former that is
highly precious and has been difficult to prepare, and
wherein maintenance of the die can be done inexpensively
when its orifice former will have been worn out.Other objects and advantages of the present invention
will become apparent from its embodiments described
below. According to the present invention there is
provided a die
as defined by Claim 1.Preferably, the orifice forming portion of the
mandrel is circular in cross-section. The die may further comprise key pieces each held
by and between forward and rearward shoulders, with the
forward shoulder facing a rear end of the gripper and
formed in the inner peripheral surface of the axial bore,
and the rearward shoulder
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A die (1) for extruding elongate articles each
having a longitudinal orifice, the die (1) comprising:


a male die (1) having an orifice forming portion
(9) and a female die (21) having a forming hole (20), said

male die (1) being combined with said female die (21) so as
to locate said orifice forming portion (9) within said

forming hole (20), said male die (1) including:
a thin rod-shaped mandrel (2),
a

leading end portion (9) of said thin rod-shaped mandrel (2)
constituting said orifice forming portion; and

a mandrel holder (4),

   characterised in that said male die further includes
a gripper (3) composed of gripping segments (11)
each having a straight groove (12) formed in an inner

surface thereof to form a mandrel-gripping bore in said
gripper (3) wherein the diameter of said mandrel-gripping

bore is slightly smaller than that of said mandrel (2) so
as to fit forcibly and sideways on said thin rod-shaped

mandrel (2),
the mandrel holder (4) having an axial bore (5) for

receiving and holding the gripper (3);

   in that the thin rod-shaped mandrel
(2) is uniform in cross-section, has a diameter of 3mm or less and

is tightly surrounded and gripped by the segments (11)
of the gripper (3) being placed in the axial bore (5) of

the mandrel holder (4), with said orifice forming portion
(9) protruding a predetermined distance forwardly from said

gripper (3), and in that an inner peripheral surface of the
axial bore (5) is shrinkage-fitted, interference-fitted or

otherwise fixedly fitted on outer peripheral surfaces of
the gripping segments (11), thereby urging the gripping

segments (11) to prevent the thin rod-shaped mandrel (2)
from slipping off said gripping segments (11)

longitudinally thereof during an extruding process.
A die as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
the orifice forming portion (9) of the mandrel (2) is

circular in cross-section.
A die as claimed in claim 1 or 2, further
comprising key pieces (6) each held by and between forward

and rearward shoulders (24), with the forward shoulder
facing a rear end of the gripper (3) and formed in the

inner peripheral surface of the axial bore (5), and the
rearward shoulder (24) being formed in the outer peripheral

surface of each gripping segments (11) and at an
intermediate region thereof so as to face a front end of

the gripper (3), whereby the gripper (3) is immovably and
correctly positioned in the axial bore (5).
A die as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised
in that the thin rod-shaped mandrel (2) has a lug (7)

protruding sideways and resting on the rear end surface of

the gripper (3), thereby correctly positioning the mandrel
(2) relative to the gripper (3).
A die as claimed in any preceding claim, further
comprising a plurality of thin rod-shaped mandrels (2) each

having an orifice forming portion (9).
A die as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that
each of the plurality of mandrels (2) is held by a separate

gripper (3), and that the mandrel holder (4) has a
plurality of axial bores (5) for holding the grippers (3).
