<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for controlling 
hydraulic construction equipment, and more particularly to an apparatus and a method 
for controlling a moving speed of each bucket and a moving speed ratio between each 
bucket to be proportional to a degree of operation of each operation indicator and an 
operation ratio between each operation indicator regardless of changes in various 
working conditions or load pressures. Generally, the hydraulic construction equipment such as excavators, loaders and 
dozers have the buckets moved by using a plurality of variable displacement pumps and a 
plurality of hydraulic cylinders, and these buckets are operated by various operation 
indicators such as joystick, pedal, lever, etc. The design of such equipment is attempted so that the moving speed of each 
bucket and the moving speed ratio between each bucket can be proportional to the  
 
degree of operation of each operation indicator and the operation ratio between each 
operation indicator, and the oil amount supplied from the pump is proportional to the 
degree of operation of each operation indicator in order to produce the moving speed 
required by each bucket. However, since the pump has the limit value of the mechanical maximum discharge 
amount of oil, and the load pressure varies depending on the working conditions such as 
excavation, dumping and ground leveling, there have been problems that the sum of the 
oil amounts required to produce the moving speed of the bucket corresponding to the 
degree of operation required by the operation indicator often exceeds the maximum 
dischargeable amount of oil for a given load pressure. Moreover, in case of the combined 
moving of the buckets, the actual speed ratio of each bucket does not accurately 
correspond to the operation ratio of the operation indicator. In other words, since the moving speed of each bucket and the moving speed ratio 
between of each bucket are not accurately proportional to the degree of operation of 
each operation indicator and the operation ratio between each operation indicator, there 
has been drawback of lowering the work efficiency.  It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and a method for 
controlling a moving speed of each bucket and a moving speed ratio between each 
bucket to be accurately proportional to a degree of operation of each operation indicator 
and an operation ratio between each operation indicator regardless of changes in various 
working conditions and load
