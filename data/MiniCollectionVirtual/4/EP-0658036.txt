<ABSTRACT>
In a facsimile communication method according to the 
present invention, if a relay broadcast mode is set by an 

operator, in which receiving station numbers or the like is 
inputted from an operating section 14, the receiving station 

numbers are stored in a block B1. If a start key is operated 
in this state, a document set in a scanner section 12 is read, 

and image data corresponding to the read document are 
sequentially stored in a block B2. If information on the 

document corresponding to one page is read, the receiving 
station numbers are read out of the block B1, to produce a 

transmission frame. Further, the image data is read out of 
the block B2, to produce a transmission frame. The produced 

transmission frames are sequentially transmitted to a relay 
station 3. Since the receiving station numbers are 

transmitted as a part of information, therefore, it is 
possible to significantly reduce communication time, as 

compared with a case where a DNL signal including receiving 
station numbers is transmitted as a part of the transmission 

control procedure. As a result, it is possible to reduce 
communication 
costs, as compared with the conventional costs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a facsimile 
communication method applied when the operation of a called 
terminal device is controlled from a calling terminal device 
and a facsimile for carrying out the facsimile communication 
method. Facsimile communication for transmitting information 
corresponding to an original image formed on a document 
through a telephone line has been conventionally widely 
established. Facsimile communication has been generally established in 
accordance with the transmission control procedure defined in 
CCITT recommendation T.30. In the transmission control 
procedure, the type of control signal transmitted from each of 
facsimiles, the transmission timing of the control signal, and 
the like are defined. If an attempt to transmit information 
corresponding to an original image formed on one document of 
A4 size of Japanese Industrial Standard is made, for example, 
in accordance with the transmission control procedure, 
approximately 30 seconds were formerly required as the total 
communication time. In recent years, approximately 20 seconds  
 
have been required, coupled with the improvement in the 
communication capability of a modem. In addition, 
approximately 10 to 15 seconds have been required in the case 
of a high speed facsimile (MMR / ECM, an apparatus for 
establishing communication at 14.4 kbps). One of facsimile communication methods include a 
communication method referred to as relay broadcast 
(designate) communication. This relay broadcast communication 
is a communication method in which if it is desired to 
transmit the same information from a certain facsimile 
(hereinafter referred to as a "transmission station") to a 
plurality of facsimiles (hereinafter referred to as "receiving 
stations"), the information is not directly transmitted to 
each of the receiving stations to which the information is to 
be transmitted but transmitted to another facsimile 
(hereinafter referred to as a "relay station") once and then, 
transmitted to the receiving station from the relay station. In the relay broadcast communication, the transmission 
station must give a facsimile number (hereinafter referred to 
as a "receiving station number") of each of the receiving 
stations to the relay station. The receiving station number is transmitted as a 
transmission control signal prior to transmitting the 
information, for example. Specifically, in addition to each 
of the control signals in the transmission control procedure  
 
defined in the above described CCITT
