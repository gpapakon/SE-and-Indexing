<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a magnetic recording medium 
which results in the effective oblique orientation of 

magnetic fine particles without aggregation of the particles. 
The method results in a magnetic recording medium having an 

upper magnetic layer containing needle-shaped, granular, or 
plate-like magnetic particles, and at least one lower 

nonmagnetic layer formed on a nonmagnetic support so that the 
magnetic particles have the maximum degree of orientation in 

an oblique or perpendicular direction with respect to a 
surface of the support. The oblique or perpendicular 

orientation is performed in the wet state of a magnetic layer 
and in the condition in which the amount of the solvent 

residue in the upper magnetic layer is 40 to 80% after the 
upper magnetic layer and the lower nonmagnetic layer are 

applied sequentially or simultaneously to form a multilayer. 
At the same time, the upper magnetic layer is formed so as to 

be thinner than the lower nonmagnetic layer and subjected to 
horizontal orientation with a plane of the surface of the 

support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention relates to a method for
producing a magnetic recording medium and particularly to a
method for producing a magnetic recording medium which has a
magnetic layer containing magnetic particles oriented
obliquely or perpendicularly with respect to the plane of the
support and on which high-density recording can be performed.Heretofore, see for instance US-A-4 874 633
magnetic recording media such as a
magnetic tape, a floppy disk, and so on, are produced
generally by the steps of: applying a coating composition
prepared by dispersing magnetic fine particles in a resin
dissolved by an organic solvent onto a running belt-like
flexible support; orienting to desired direction easily-magnetizable
axes of the fine magnetic particles in the
coating composition applied on the support, drying and
solidifying the applied coating composition, and surface-treating
the resulted coating layer such as calendering,
thereby obtaining a belt-like magnetic recording medium; and
slitting, cutting or punching the belt-like magnetic
recording medium to obtain a magnetic tape having a desired
width or a magnetic disk having a desired shape. Recording a large amount of information in a limited
recording area, that is, high-density recording, has been
required increasingly of magnetic tapes and floppy disks.
Reduction in the size of a magnetic head therefore has been
desired because the magnetic flux generated from the magnetic
head must be concentrated in a fine area. The volume of the
magnetic layer capable of inverting the direction of
magnetization decreases with the reduction in generated
magnetic flux caused by minimizing the size of the magnetic
head. Therefore, it is necessary to thin the magnetic layer
for the purpose of obtaining high-density recording.Although it is necessary in high-density recording to
thin the magnetic layer beyond that found in the magnetic
layer of a conventional recording medium, in the case where
such a thin film is formed singly, not only is it very
difficult to form a faultless uniform coating but also it is
nearly impossible to perform sufficient orienting treatments
because drying/solidification of the layer is completed
rapidly.To solve that problem, for example, Japanese Patent
Unexamined Publication No. Sho-62-212933 proposed a method of
the type in which, as shown in Fig. 9, a simultaneous
multilayer coating apparatus 8 applies a lower-layer magnetic
coating composition 3 and an upper-layer magnetic coating
composition 4 onto a nonmagnetic support 2 drawn out of a
feed
