<ABSTRACT>
An investment casting process is carried out by the formation of a 
lost pattern in a lost mold and its ceramic coating once formed. The 

process comprises the following steps: 

1) Manufacturing a positive pattern (i.e., with the same shape as 
the casting to be made) either with hard or elastic material, depending 

on the cases. 
2) Manufacturing a temporary mold by pouring a liquid over the 
positive pattern and cooling it up to its solidification. 
3) Extracting the positive pattern. 
4) Forming a temporary pattern by pouring a second liquid into the 
cavity of the temporary mold and cooling it up to its solidification. 
5) Melting or solving the temporary mold. 
6) Coating the temporary pattern with ceramics, forming a solid 
ceramic shell around the temporary pattern. 
7) Melting or solving out the temporary pattern and evacuating the 
resulting liquid from the ceramic shell. 
8) Filling the shell cavity with molten metal which is allowed to 
solidify to form the final cast piece. 
The process allows the production of all types of top quality cast 
parts as it makes possible -irrespective of their complexity- forming a 

lost pattern in a lost mold, thus avoiding the risk of breakage of lost 
patterns as well as the need of using cores (with high deformation 

risks). In addition recyclable materials are used in the production of 
the lost patterns and molds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an investment
casting process used to produce casting pieces by means of
the achievement of a ceramic coated lost pattern and said
pattern being made through a lost patternThe present invention offers substantial
improvements in the investment casting process, those
being: "Lost Wax" and "Temporary Pattern by freezing a
liquid in an elastic mold". Both processes allow for the
manufacture of high quality castings. However, each
process presents a number of drawbacks.
a) PROCESS "LOST WAX"
The main disadvantages of this process originate in
the transformation and handling of the used wax for
the manufacturing pattern.
1) The high cost of the necessary tooling for the
injection of the wax, which makes this process
profitable only for pieces to be manufactured on
a large scale.2) The complexity of the handling of the wax
patterns, resulting in a high cost of manpower 
in the preparation of clusters or multiple
patterns.3) Difficulty and decline in quality of the waxes
when recycled.b) PROCESS "FORMING A TEMPORARY PATTERN BY FREEZING A
LIQUID IN AN ELASTIC MOLD"
Due to the fact that the casting process by means of
ceramic coating is directed to the production of
precise parts with thin wall thickness and intricate
shapes, the main drawbacks of this process are:
1) The enormous difficulty in the extraction of the
temporary pattern from the elastic mold without
causing any cracks in the pattern when thin
walls must be obtained.2) The difficulty of manufacturing pieces that
require complex cores, which lead to the
imperative use of ceramic cores hence incurring
an increase in the price of the product.3) Difficulty in the extraction of complete
clusters from the elastic mold without causing
any cracks.German Patent DE-1 034 844 is known, through
which destructible molds are used for the production of
moulding bodies of melting elastomers such as the
polyurethane. These mols are destroyed by dissolution,
bearing in mind that these dissolvents do not have to
attack the moulding bodies.Magazine TOOLING AND PRODUCTION, vol. 44, no. 11
(1979.02) shows the manufacture of complex patterns made 
by means of different parts sticking which will form the
final pattern.Finally, Patent US-2 480 048 is also known,
which relates to a casting process which uses a low fusing
mold which may readily be removed from the article cast.
This mold if formed by a melting metal at a temperature
which does not cause any damage to the casting metal.With this invention the said drawbacks of the
current

<CLAIMS>
An investment casting process for producing castings
which starts from the formation of a positive mould which

consists of one or several parts, depending upon the
casting to be reproduced, such positive mould being made

of two sections, a first section or rigid support (2) and a
second section or cover comprising an elastic material (1),

a liquid (3) is poured over the mould
or moulds thus formed which is then cooled until it

hardens, whereupon it is removed and assembled with other
sections if the mould is made of several parts

to form a temporary mould (4,5), a second
liquid (7) having a melting point greater than that of the

former liquid (3) being poured into the mould formed, this second
liquid being thereupon hardened within the temporary mould (4,5), the

temporary mould (4,5) being then melted by submitting it to a temperature
above the melting point of the liquid from which the

mould shall have been drawn, albeit less than the melting
point of the inner liquid poured into the temporary mould (4,5), the

result being the inner hardened part or pattern (7)
which is coated with ceramics, forming a solid ceramic

shell around the temporary pattern, melting or solving out
the temporary pattern and evacuating the resulting liquid

from the ceramic shell and filling the ceramic shell
cavity with molten metal which is allowed to solidify to

form the final cast piece. 
An investment casting process for producing castings
as in claim 1, characterised in that the hardening

temperature of the liquid forming the temporary mould (4,5) or sections
of the mould is less than the hardening temperature of

the second liquid to be poured into the same and which
shall constitute the pattern (7) in the casting process.
