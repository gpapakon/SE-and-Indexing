<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with novel peptides derived
from the human p53 protein. The invention further concerns
the use of said novel peptides in: (1) the induction of
primary p53-specific T cells that can be used in a
therapeutic treatment, in particular the induction of HLA
class I-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and (2)
pharmaceutical compositions for a prophylactic or
therapeutic treatment of human individuals, all against
diseases such as a variety of human cancers that show an
overexpressed p53 protein.Human protein p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that is
involved in regulation of the cell cycle. It is expressed by
many normal cells (1). Although p53 has been implicated as a
proto-oncogene, the molecular mechanisms of p53 action in
normal and malignant cells are not well understood. It has
been demonstrated, however, that the p53 gene frequently
acquires mutations during the development of many human
malignancies including colon, breast, lung, leukemias, soft
tissue sarcomas, bladder, ovary, brain and
neurofibrosarcomas in patients with von Recklinghausen
disease (2-9). The p53 mutations which have been noted in
these cancers invariably are located in a relatively large
region of the gene that has been highly conserved through
evolution (10). These mutations, which cause amino acid
substitutions, appear to change the conformation of p53
resulting in increased stability and higher steady state
levels of this normally short lived protein (11). It is 
precisely this difference between normal cells and tumor
cells that our invention is concerned with, because it would
allow the induction of T cell immune responses against this
overexpressed p53 protein. Such T cells would subsequently
only react against tumor cells with overexpression of p53
protein and not against normal cells with minimal expression
of p53. These T cells would not necessarily have to react
against the mutated amino acid sequences of p53 (although
they could), but this invention is especially concerned with
the reaction of T cells against normal amino acid sequences
of p53 to which one would expect immunological tolerance.
These normal autologous p53 antigens can also be
overexpressed in tumors because of mutations elsewhere in
the p53 protein sequence.Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are of crucial importance
in the resistance against virus infections and the immune
surveillance against tumors (reviewed in 12 and 13). CTL
specific for viruses or tumors recognize short viral or
tumor protein-derived peptides, of about 9 amino acids
