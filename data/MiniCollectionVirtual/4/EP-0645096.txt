<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a relatively pure powdered mannitol, characterised in that it has a non-excessive and reduced friability of between 40 and 80% in a test I, a low apparent density of between 300 and 525 g/l for a particle size fraction (cut) of between 100 and 200 microns, and in addition a special particle size distribution in the sense that it contains less than 30% of particles smaller than 75 microns. This powdered mannitol possesses remarkable functional properties, which make it particularly suitable for use as a sweetening agent, texture agent, excipient or vehicle for additives in the food and pharmaceutical industries.
