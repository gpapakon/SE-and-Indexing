<ABSTRACT>
A gain-guided type AℓGaInP visible light laser diode 
in accordance with the present invention has a characteristic 

in that, an n-type current-blocking layer for the current 
constriction in the double-heterojunction structure is 

highly doped with n-type impurity so as to prevent the 
formation of p-type inversion layer therein. When an 

n-GaAs current-blocking layer is formed on a p-GaInP 
etching stopper layer doped with zinc, the n-type impurity 

concentration of the n-GaAs current blocking layer is 
selected to be 3 x 10¹⁸ cm⁻³ or more to achieve a large 

kink-light output at a low oscillation threshold current.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gain-guided type 
laser diodes, and more particularly to AℓGaInP visible 
light laser diodes with oscillation wavelength not greater 
than 680 nm. The gain-guided type laser diodes are attractive 
light sources for barcode readers in POS and FA systems. 
A conventional gain-guided type AℓGaInP visible light 
laser diode is shown in Fig. 1 as reported in ELECTRONICS 
LETTERS 16th January 1987 Vol. 23, No. 2, p.85. Referring to Fig. 1, an n-GaAs buffer layer 2 is 
formed on an n-GaAs substrate 1. On top of the buffer 
layer 2 there is formed a double heterojunction structure 
consisting of an n-AℓGaInP cladding layer 3, a GaInP 
active layer 4, a p-AℓGaInP cladding layer 5, a p-GaInP 
etching stopper layer 6, a pair of n-GaAs current blocking 
layers 7 and a p-GaAs contact layer 8. Here, the fabrication step of the conventional 
structure shown in Fig. 1 will be described. First, a 
six-layer structure from the n-GaAs buffer layer 2 to 
the n-GaAs current blocking layer 7 is grown sequentially 
by using a first vapor phase growth technique such as 
MOVPE (Metal-Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy). Subsequently, 
a trench stripe 9 is formed in n-GaAs current blocking  
 
layer 7 to expose a stripe region of p-GaInP etching 
stopping layer 6. Over the entire surface of n-GaAs 
current blocking layer 7 including stripe 9 is formed by 
the second MOVPE growth a p-GaAs contact layer 8 over the 
entire surface of which in turn a p-side ohmic electrode 10 
of Ti/Pt/An is deposited. Further an n-side ohmic 
electrode 11 of AuGeNi is deposited on the entire under-surface 
of substrate 1. In this prior structure, the current is constructed 
by the p-GaAs contact layer 8 and the GaAs current blocking 
layer 7. The p-GaInP etching stopper layer 6 serves, for 
forming a stripe 9 in n-GaAs of current blocking layer 7 
by chemical etching, to stop the etching to prevent from 
being over-etched, and has another purpose of reducing 
electrical resistance between the p-AℓGaInP cladding 
layer 5 and the p-GaAs contact layer 8. In such a gain-guided 
type laser diode, injected carriers causes a 
refractive index difference in the active layer to guide 
a light along with the stripe direction. Although the above stated gain-guided type laser 
diodes can be made easily compared with a buried hetero 
structure type laser diodes, a so called kink appears 
in its current-light output characteristic when the output 
is increased, as shown in Figure 4. This is because the active 
layer of the gain-guide
