<ABSTRACT>
A treatment comprising 15-80 % (by weight in terms of solid content, the same will apply hereinbelow) of 
a highly saturated nitrile polymer rubber latex with an iodine value of 120 or less, 5-70 % of another rubber latex 

and 2-15 % of a water-soluble resorcinolformaldehyde condensate; a rubber-reinforcing glass fiber coated with the 
treatment; and a rubber product reinforced by the glass fiber, such as a toothed belt or tire. The glass fiber may further 

be coated with a secondary treatment such as a halogenated polymer adhesive. This fiber has such a high bonding 
force against a rubber matrix that the reinforced product undergoes neither a reduction in the strength thereof nor 

peeling of the fiber from the matrix even under repeated bending stress, and also has sufficient resistances to heat and 
water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a glass fiber coating 
composition, a rubber-reinforcing glass fiber product coated 
with the coating composition, and a rubber article such as a 
rubber belt, a tire and the like, formed using the glass fiber 
product as a reinforcing material, and a process for treating 
the glass fiber. Reinforcing fibers such as a glass fiber have been 
conventionally widely used as a reinforcing material for 
rubber articles such as a rubber belt, a tire and the like. The rubber articles such as the rubber belt may be 
repeatedly subjected to a flexing stress to cause a flex 
fatigue, resulting in a reduced performance, a peel-off 
between the reinforcing material and a rubber matrix and a 
wearing of the reinforcing fiber. Further, the strength is 
liable to be reduced. Such phenomena tend to be particularly 
accelerated by a heat and water. In order to prevent a peel-off 
due to such a flex fatigue and to provide a sufficient 
reinforcing effect, it is necessary to increase the conformity 
and adhesion between the reinforcing fiber and the rubber and 
to provide the rubber article with heat and water resistances. 
For this purpose, various treating agents may be applied onto 
the surface of the reinforcing fiber. For example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No.221433/89, a treating agent has been proposed which 
employs, in combination, a water-soluble resorcinol-formaldehyde 
condensate, a vinylpyridine/butadiene/styrene 
terpolymer latex, a dicarboxylated butadiene/styrene copolymer 
latex and a chlorosulfonated polyethylene latex. The use of such a treating agent makes it possible to 
satisfy the adhesion between the reinforcing fiber and the  
 
rubber matrix and the heat and flex resistances of the 
treating agent itself to a certain extent, but is accompanied 
by a disadvantage that when a reinforcing fiber coated with 
such treating agent is used, sufficiently satisfactory heat, 
water and flex resistances cannot be obtained because of a 
insufficient water resistance of the treating agent itself and 
hence, it is difficult to provide an excellent rubber article. The present inventors have previously invented and 
proposed a rubber-reinforcing glass fiber cord coated with a 
composition consisting essentially of a water-soluble 
resorcinol/formaldehyde condensate having an improved adhesive 
strength to a heat-resistant rubber, and a nitrile group-containing 
highly saturated polymer rubber having an iodine 
value of 120 or less (see Japanese Patent Application
