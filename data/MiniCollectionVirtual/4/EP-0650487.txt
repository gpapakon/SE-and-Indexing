<DESCRIPTION>
 Novel Diazabicycloalkenes and Processes for the Preparation thereofTechnical fieldThe present invention relates to novel diazabicycloalkenes and processes for preparing these compounds. The compounds of the present invention are useful as intermediates in the preparation of quinolone-type or β-lactam-type antibacterial agents.The present invention also relates to novel quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and to processes for preparing these compounds.Background ArtIn general, commercially available quinolone-type antibacterials such as ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin are known to exhibit strong antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. However, these prior art compounds suffer from the disadvantage that they are less effective against Gram-positive bacteria.Disclosure of InventionThe present inventors have conducted extensive studies which have led to the synthesis of novel 2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene and 2,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]oct-4-ene, which can be introduced into a molecule of quinolone-type and jS-lactam-type antibacterials as side-chain. The present inventors have also invented processes for preparing these compounds.The present invention relates to compounds of Formula (I) 
whereinR, and R5 each represent hydrogen, lower alkyl, or a conventional amino-protecting group;R2, R3 and R4 each represent hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower alkyl substituted by amino, hydroxyl or halogen; and n denotes an integer of 0 or 1.The present invention also provides novel quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives of Formula (I-A):wherein, |, R3 and R4 are the same as defined above;A is hydrogen or chlorine atom, or methyl or an amino group;B is a lower alkyl group, or a cyclopropyl or a phenyl group optionally substituted with a hlogen atom; andC is nitrogen atom, or a methyne group optionally substituted with a lower alkyl or a lower alkoxy group or a halogen atom, and their pharmaceutically acceptable 

salts.The present invention is further explained hereinbelow.An object of the present invention is to provide diazabicycloalkenes ofFormula (I), more particularly 2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene and 2,7- diazabicyclo[3.3.0]oct-4-ene and their derivatives.Another object of the present invention is to provide novel quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which possess a broad spectrum of potent antibacterial activities against various microorganisms, and to provide processes for preparing these compounds.The term
