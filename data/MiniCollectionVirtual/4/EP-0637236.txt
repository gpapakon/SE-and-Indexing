<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is a pharmaceutical 
preparation for oral use, especially a tablet, which as its 
active ingredient contains a pharmacologically acceptable 
salt of dichloromethylene bisphoshonic acid, i.e. a clodronate, 
especially disodium clodronate. Dichloromethylene bisphosphonic acid, especially in the 
form of its salt, such as the disodium salt, is a known 
drug for example for the treatment of diseases relating to 
the calcium metabolism and to the sceletal system, such as 
to the metabolism of the bone, for example for osteoporosis. Clodronate has previously been administered orally in the 
form of conventional compressed tablets or capsules (EP-A-0 275 468). Such 
a tablet or capsule disintegrates in the stomach of the 
patient releasing the active agent, which in the acidic 
environment of the stomach is converted to the free acid 
form. As clodronic acid is poorly absorbed, the bioavailability 
of the active agent will be low, and consequently 
the required dosage level has to be increased. This in turn 
is a disadvantage as a large tablet has to be used, which 
is inconvenient for the patient and reduces patient 
compliance. Also a large dose increases the risk for side-effects. According to the invention it has now been discovered that 
it is possible to achieve a substantially improved bioavailability 
if the active agent is prevented from being 
transformed into its acid form, that is, if it is allowed 
to pass the stomach region in unliberated form into the 
lower digestive tract to be released at a site thereof 
which is optimal from the point of view of the absorption 
of the active agent.  
 According to the invention it has now been discovered that 
the said objective is reached if the preparation is a drug 
delivery form which is enteric coated with a film which 
dissolves at a pH of from 5 to 7.2. Preferably the film dissolves at a pH of from 5.0 to 6.5. There is a number of film forming agents suitable for the 
purpose of the invention. Important from the point of view 
of the invention is that the agent used dissolves at the pH 
mentioned, i.e. at pH 5 to 7.2. These agents are known as 
such and there is a number of commercially available 
substances. Of such agents may be mentioned i.a. shellac, 
cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) (e.g. Aquateric® by FMC 
Corporation), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate 
succinate (HPMCAS, e.g. Aqoat® by ShinEtsu), hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP, HP 50 and HP 55 by 
ShinEtsu), polyvinyl acetate phthalate
