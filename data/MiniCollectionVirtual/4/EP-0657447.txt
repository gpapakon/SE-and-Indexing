<ABSTRACT>
A method for the purification of lactide is provided 
which permits lactide of high optical purity or DL-lactide of 

high purity to be produced from crude lactide by the removal 
of meso-lactide from the crude lactide. This method for the 

purification of lactide is characterized by causing a mixture 
containing L-lactide and/or D-lactide together with meso-lactide 

to contact with water thereby effecting hydrolysis of 
meso-lactide. This method can remove meso-lactide from crude 

lactide and produce DL-lactide and/or optically active lactide 
of high optical purity in high yield and, in the production of 

optically active lactide, can eliminate the restrictions 
otherwise imposed on the formation of meso-lactide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the 
purification of lactide which is a cyclic ester formed from 
two molecules of lactic acid. Lactide which is a cyclic ester formed from two 
molecules of lactic acid has been known to have three forms; 
L-lactide molecule formed from two molecules of L-lactic acid, 
D-lactide molecule formed from two molecules of D-lactic acid, 
and meso-lactide molecule formed from L-lactic acid and D-lactic 
acid. Lactide is an important compound as an intermediate 
for polylactic acid which has been attracting attention as a 
biodegradable plastic substance in recent years. It has been 
known that polylactic acid with a high molecular weight can be 
obtained by the ring-opening polymerization of lactide. The nature of the polylactic acid is varied by the 
optical purity of the lactic acid monomer forming the 
polylactic acid, namely the optical purity of the polylactic 
acid, as well as by the molecular weight of the polylactic 
acid. It has been known that pure L- or D-polylactic acid 
excels L- or D-polylactic acid having a like molecular weight 
and a lower optical purity in terms of strength or 
formability. Perfect racemic lactic acid, namely, DL-polylactic 
acid formed from DL-lactic acid, excels optically 
active polylactic acid in terms of flexibility and, therefore, 
is expected to find utility in special applications. Now, the methods heretofore introduced to the art for 
the synthesis of lactide will be described below. Lactide is generally synthesized by the so-called 
reaction distillation method which uses polylactic acid with a 
relatively low molecular weight (lactic acid oligomer which 
will be referred to hereinafter as "prepolymer" in association 
with the reaction for synthesis of lactide) as an intermediate 
and which comprises the steps of cyclizing this intermediate  
 
at a temperature of not lower than 180 °C in the presence of a 
catalyst thereby forming lactide which is a cyclic ester 
formed from two molecules of lactic acid and extracting this 
lactide in the form of vapor out of the reaction system. To 
be more specific, the lactide is synthesized by the following 
procedure using lactic acid as a raw material. 
(1) Lactic acid is heated under a reduced pressure 
(generally below 20 mmHg) until dehydration and condensation 
thereof and converted into a prepolymer. The temperature of 
this heating is kept below 180 °C for the purpose of 
preventing lactic acid from racemization. (2) The prepolymer and SnO added thereto as a 
catalyst for the

A method for the purification of lactide 
characterised by removing meso-lactide from a mixture 

containing meso-lactide together with L-lactide and/or D-lactide 
by bringing the mixture into contact with water. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the mixture is initially at least partly in a molten 

state and, by bringing the mixture into contact with 
water, separation of L-lactide and/or D-lactide in the 

form of crystals is induced at the same time as the 
removal of the meso-lactide. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in 
that the mixture is in a molten state. 
A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, 
characterised in that the mixture additionally contains 

lactic acid, water, and other impurities. 
A method for the purification of lactide 
characterised by dissolving the crystals L-lactide and/or 

D-lactide obtained by a method as claimed in any 
preceding Claim in a solvent incapable of reacting with 

the lactide and subjecting the resultant solution to 

recrystallisation.
