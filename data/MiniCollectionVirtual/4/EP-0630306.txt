<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a novel method for producing self-supporting composite bodies, formed by the oxidation reaction of a parent metal and a solid-phase oxidant to produce at least one oxidation reaction product comprising, in most cases, at least one intermetallic phase, and, optionally, having at least one metallic component introduced during formation of the body to impart certain properties to the formed body. The invention also relates to formation of, in some cases, ceramic phases in addition to the intermetallic phase(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel method for producing self-supporting 
composite bodies, formed by the oxidation reaction of a parent 
metal and a solid-phase oxidant to produce at least one oxidation reaction 
product comprising at least one intermetallic phase, and, 
optionally, having at least one metallic component introduced during 
formation of the body to impart certain properties to the formed body. The 
invention also relates to formation of, in some cases, ceramic phases in 
addition to the intermetallic phase(s). This application is a continuation-in-part of Commonly Owned and 
Copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/854,281 in the names of 
William Bayard Johnson et al. and entitled "Method for Forming Ceramic 
Articles by a Reactive Infiltration Technique and Articles Made Thereby. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use 
of ceramics for structural applications historically served by metals. The 
impetus for this interest has been the superiority of ceramics with respect 
to certain properties, such as corrosion resistance, hardness, modulus of 
elasticity, and refractory capabilities, when compared with metals. Current efforts at producing higher strength, more reliable, and 
tougher ceramic articles are largely focused upon (1) the development of 
improved processing methods for monolithic ceramics and (2) the development 
of new material compositions, notably ceramic matrix composites. A composite structure is one which comprises a heterogeneous 
material, body or article made of two or more different materials which are 
intimately combined in order to attain desired properties of the composite. 
For example, two different materials may be intimately combined by 
embedding one in a matrix of the other. A ceramic matrix composite 
structure typically comprises a ceramic matrix which incorporates one or 
more diverse types of filler materials such as particulates, fibers, rods, 
and the like.  
 There are several known limitations or difficulties in substituting 
ceramics for metals, such as scaling versatility, capability to produce 
complex shapes, satisfying the properties required for the end use 
application, and costs. Several copending patent applications assigned and 
issued Patents to the same owner as this application (hereinafter referred 
to as Commonly Owned Patent Applications and Patents), overcome these 
limitations or difficulties and provide novel methods for reliably 
producing ceramic materials, including ceramic composite materials.

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a self-supporting body comprising 
infiltrating a permeable mass with an oxidation reaction 

product obtained by oxidation of a parent metal to form a 
polycrystalline material comprising (i) the oxidation reaction 

product of said parent metal with at least one solid-phase 
oxidant, and (ii) a metallic component comprising at least one 

metallic phase, said method comprising the steps of: 

(a) forming a permeable mass comprising at least one 
solid-phase oxidant containing a metal, which solid oxidant 

reacts with the molten parent metal to form an oxidation 
reaction product comprising at least one intermetallic phase; 
(b) orienting said permeable mass and a source of said 
parent metal relative to each other so that formation of said 

at least one oxidation reaction product will occur into said 
permeable mass; 
(c) heating said source of parent metal to a temperature 
above the melting point of said parent metal but below the 

melting point of said oxidation reaction product to form a 
body of molten pare
nt metal; 
(d) reacting said body of molten parent metal with said 
at least one solid-phase oxidant at said temperature to permit 

said oxidation reaction product to form; 
(e) maintaining at least a portion of said at least one 
oxidation reaction product in contact with and between said 

molten parent metal and said solid-phase oxidant at said 
temperature to progressively draw molten parent metal through 

said oxidation reaction product towards said solid-phase 
oxidant to permit fresh oxidation reaction product to continue 

to form at an interface between said solid-phase oxidant and 
previously formed oxidation reaction product that has infiltrated 

said permeable mass: and 
(f) continuing step (e) at said temperature for a time 
sufficient to infiltrate at least a portion of said permeable 

mass with said polycrystalline material, thereby forming said 
self-supporting body comprising (a) said oxidation reaction  

 
product comprising at least one intermetallic phase; and (b) a 

metallic component comprising at least one metallic phase. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said metallic component 
comprises at least one metal selected from the group consisting 

of at least one residual unreacted component of said 
parent metal and at least one second or foreign metal. 
The method of claim 2, wherein said at least one second 
or foreign metal comprises a metal reduced from said solid-phase 

oxidant. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said permeable mass 
further comprises at least one second or foreign metal. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said permeable mass 
further comprises at least one filler material. 
The method of claim 5, wherein said filler material 
comprises at least one material selected from the group consisting 

of silicon carbide and titanium diboride. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said parent metal comprises 
at least one metal selected from the group consisting 

of aluminum, silicon, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, tin and 
zinc. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said solid-phase oxidant

The method of claim 3, wherein said at least one second 
or foreign metal comprises an intermetallic phase.
