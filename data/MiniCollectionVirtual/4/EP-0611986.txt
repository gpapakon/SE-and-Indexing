<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid photographic 
processing composition for silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material, more specifically a solid photographic 
processing composition for silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
material having excellent solubility, practically 
sufficient strength and remarkably improved chemical 
stability. Silver halide color photographic light-sensitive 
materials (hereinafter also referred to as light-sensitive 
materials or photographic materials) are processed in 
developing, desilvering, washing, stabilizing and other 
processes after exposure. Silver halide black-and-white 
photographic light-sensitive materials are developed and fixed 
after exposure. A black-and-white developer or a color  
 
developer, a bleacher or a bleach-fixer, a fixer, tap water or 
deionized water, a stabilizing solution and a dye stabilizer 
are used for development, desilvering, fixing, washing, 
waterless washing and dye stabilization, respectively. The liquids capable of performing these processes are 
called processing solutions. Each processing solution is 
usually kept at a temperature of 30 to 40°C, in which the 
light-sensitive material is immersed and processed. These processes are usually carried out by sequentially 
transporting the light-sensitive material through processing 
tanks containing the above processing solutions, using an 
automatic processing machine or another means. The automatic processing machine mentioned herein is 
generally a processing machine having a developing portion, a 
fixing portion, a desilvering portion, a washing or 
stabilizing portion and a drying portion, and a means for 
automatically sequentially transporting the photographic 
light-sensitive material to the processing tanks. In carrying out processing using such an automatic 
processing machine, the processing solution in each processing 
tank is supplemented with a processing agent to keep the 
activity of the processing solution in the processing tank 
constant. For this purpose, it is a common practice to prepare a 
replenisher containing the processing agent dissolved therein.  Specifically, processing is carried out while supplying 
the previously prepared replenisher from the replenisher tank 
to the processing tank as appropriate. In this case, the replenisher to be stored in the 
replenisher tank is usually prepared in a separate place, but 
in mini-labs etc., the replenisher is usually prepared in a 
given amount in a replenisher tank equipped near the 
processi
