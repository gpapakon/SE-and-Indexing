<ABSTRACT>
Multilayered heat-insulating and vibration-damping building element having a core layer (1), which contains cavities, and at least one outer layer (2, 3), which protects the core layer (1), the core layer (1) containing melted-on parts of thermoplastic. According to the invention, the core layer (1) comprises filler of paper-like material, reduced to pieces in strip form and mixed, and thin-layer thermoplastic materials of approximately the same melting temperature, the parts of the filler being firmly bonded to one another and to the outer layers (2, 3) by a hot-melt adhesive bond originating from the plastic components. By a production process according to the invention, paper-like material and thin-layered material of thermoplastics of at least approximately the same melting temperature are reduced to narrow strips and/or pieces and mixed with one another. The loose mixture is heated until it softens, but not to such an extent that the plastic components melt, and is compressed in a moulding press together with at least one outer layer with further heating until the intended shape of the building element and melting on of the plastic components are achieved, and is subsequently cooled until the plastic components solidify.

Board-like heat-insulating and vibration-damping 
structural element which has a core layer (1), containing 

cavities and bringing about heat insulation and vibration 
damping, and at least one covering layer (2, 3) which 

protects the core layer (1) and which can be subjected to 
relatively high mechanical loads, the core layer (1) 

containing fused-on thermoplastic particles, characterized 
in that the core layer (1) consists of mixed filling 

material comminuted into strip-like pieces and composed 
of paper-like substances and of thin-layered 

thermoplastics, the constituents of the filling material 
being fixedly connected to one another and to the 

covering layers (2, 3) by means of fusion bonding originating 
from the plastic constituents. 
Structural element according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that it is designed as a board with two 

covering layers (2, 3) which cover the core layer (1) on 
both sides. 
Structural element according to one of Claims 1 
or 2, characterized in that the core layer (1) consists 

of used packaging material in the form of 5 to 10 mm wide 
strips or small pieces of paper, card, corrugated card as 

well as films and thin-walled thermoplastic containers 
having approximately the same fusion temperature, the 

constituents of the core layer (1), in each case arranged 
in an irregularly bent and at least partially coiled 

manner irregularly relative to one another, being connected 
to one another by fusion bonding originating from 

the plastic constituents. 
Structural element according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that it contains, at least in one 

of the covering layers (2, 3), a mesh-like reinforcing 
interlining (2a) composed of material of high tensile 

strength. 
Structural element according to one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that at least one of the covering 

layers (2, 3) contains a layer of moisture-proof material 
serving as moisture barrier.  

 
Structural element according to one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that at least one of the covering 

layers (2, 3) contains a fire-retarding layer composed of 
a mineral building material. 
Structural element according to one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterized in that the core layer (1) contains 

spacer inserts (4), on which the covering layers (2, 3) 
are supported. 
Structural element according to one of Claims 1 
to 7, characterized in that it is designed as a cylinder 

half-shell. 
Method for producing a structural element according 
to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 


used packaging material consisting of paper-like 
substances and of films and thin-walled 

thermoplastic containers having approximately the 
same fusion temperature are comminuted into strip-like 

pieces as filling material for the core layer 
(1), 
the comminuted filling material is intermixed in the 
desired quantity ratio of paper-like material and 

plastics, so that the material particles are present 
in the mixture in an irregularly bent and at least 

partially coiled manner, 
the material forming a covering layer (3) of the 
structural element is laid onto the lower inner 

surface of a heatable press die, the filling 
material for the core layer (1) is spread on the 

said covering layer, and the said filling material 
is covered with a further covering layer (2) or with 

a thinner covering not bondable with the heated die 
wall, and 
the entire die filling is compacted by moving the 
die together, until the desired structure of the 

core layer (1) is obtained, with simultaneous 
heating by the die walls, until the fusion temperature 

of the plastic constituents of the core layer 
(1) is reached, and thereafter the core layer is 

allowed to cool until it solidifies again, and it is  
 

taken out of the die. 
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that, before the die is loaded, the filling material for 

the core layer (1) is preheated in the loosened state 
until it softens, but not until the fusion temperature of 

the plastic constituents is reached.
