<ABSTRACT>
Cooking plate for mounting in a frame or in an opening of a work surface, comprising a plate made of glass-ceramic as the cooking area, and a metallic frame element bonded permanently elastically by silicone adhesive to the underside of the plate in the edge region thereof, that leg of the frame element which is bonded to the cooking area running inwards flush from the edge of the plate and parallel to it and bending downwards there at right angles to the leg which is bonded to the plate, the adhesive effecting the non-positive bond between plate and the frame element forming, on the end faces of the plate and of the leg which is adhesively bonded to it, a non-positively bonded silicone edge running all the way round which ends flush with the surface of the plate and projects beyond the underside of the leg which is bonded to the plate, forming a sealing lip.

<CLAIMS>
A pre-fabricated cooking surface unit (1) for installation 
without adhesive in a frame construction or in a cutout, in 

particular in a work surface, comprising a plate (2) of glass 
ceramic or a similar material as the cooking surface, and a metal 

frame part (3) which before installation is connected in a 
permanently resilient manner on the underside in the marginal 

region of the plate, in particular using silicone adhesive, and 
which is of a size suitable for bearing on the sealing frame or 

in the installation cutout, the limb of the angular frame part 
(3) connected to the cooking surface running flush with the edge 

of the plate (2) and inwards parallel thereto and being 
downwardly bent off there, in particular at a right angle to the 

limb connected to the plate, characterized in that the adhesive 
producing the force-fitting connection between the plate (2) and 

the frame part (3) before installation in the frame construction 
forms a peripheral margin connected by force fit on the end faces 

of the plate (2) and of the limb connected thereto by adhesion, 
this margin ending flush with the surface of the plate and 

projecting beyond the underside of the limb connected by adhesion 
to the plate (2) such that a lip (6) is formed. 
A cooking surface according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the thickness of the peripheral margin constructed by the 

adhesive is from 1.5 mm to 3.5 mm. 
A cooking surface unit according to Claim 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the lip (6) has radii of â‰¥ 0.5 mm.
