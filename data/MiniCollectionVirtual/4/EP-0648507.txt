<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for collecting, processing, and storing blood components, 
such as plasma. The method involves collecting the blood component in a 

flexible storage bag (200) manufactured from ethylene vinyl acetate EVA, having a 
composition of between about 9% and about 18% vinyl acetate by weight of total 

EVA co-polymer. The EVA bag (200) is sealed, and the sample is frozen 
in the bag (200) at a 

temperature of at least as low as -30°C to form a substantially solid 
pellet contained 

in the storage bag (200). The bag (200) then is fractured and the pellet 
is removed in its intact, 

frozen form. The co-polymer bag (200) may have an inner surface with an 
etched or 

embossed pattern of sufficient dimensions to permit removal of the plasma in a 
frozen state from the storage bag (200).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to plastic bags used for the collection, processing, 
and storage of blood products, such as plasma. Specifically, the invention relates to an 
ethylene vinyl acetate bag used in the collection of human plasma, freezing the plasma 
after collection, storing the frozen plasma, and subsequent processing. Current containers used for plasma storage and processing are of two principle 
types: (1) a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flexible bag, or (2) a rigid or semi-rigid blow 
molded olefin bottle or bag. PVC bags have been used for decades for freeze storing plasma, and have the 
advantages of efficient manufacturability, low container cost, and good blood 
compatibility. However, significant disadvantages also exist with this type of container. 
The most significant disadvantage is the fragility of the container when frozen. The 
glass transition temperature (Tg), or temperature at which the film changes from 
flexible to brittle, is higher than the freezing temperatures commonly used for plasma. This means that the bag is flexible and relatively strong at room temperature, 
but becomes excessively brittle or glass-like when frozen. This fragility leads to some 
percentage of the bags breaking during storage and handling. Bag breakage is 
undesirable since it allows for potential contamination (bacterial, particulate, and the 
like) that can adversely affect the purity of products subsequently made from this 
plasma. Bacterial contamination, in particular, can adversely affect protein yields ad 
quality during the fractionation process due to the release of proteolytic enzymes and 
pyrogens. The PVC film used in the manufacture of the plasma bags presently on the 
market has routinely been manufactured using the plasticizer di-2-ethyl-hexyl  
 
phthalate (DEHP). Considerable amounts of DEHP are leached from the walls of the 
blood bags by the plasma during storage. Recently, concern has been raised over the 
potentially harmful effects of DEHP in blood products chronically transfused to 
patients. A common method for removing plasma in a frozen state from PVC storage 
bags is fracturing the bags at cryogenic temperatures, followed by shucking the bag 
from the frozen plasma. That process involves dipping the entire bag and contents 
into liquid nitrogen. The frozen bag then is shattered, for example by dropping the 
frozen bag onto a surface from a distance. The frozen plasma or blood component 
then is removed, using a process known as "shucking", from the shattered bag 
fragments.

Method of collecting, storing, and processing protein components from blood, 
comprising the steps of: 


A. collecting the protein components in a flexible bag manufactured from 
ethylene vinyl acetate EVA, wherein vinyl acetate is present in an amount of 

between about 9 and about 18 percent by weigth of total EVA; 
B. sealing the bag; 
C. exposing the bag to a temperature at least as low as about -30°C to
