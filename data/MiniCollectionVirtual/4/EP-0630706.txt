<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for forming a slide-fastener 
coupling element (E) from a metal wire (W) having a substantially 

Y-shaped cross section wherein a blank piece is cut or sliced 
off from the metal wire by a co-action of a cutoff die (2) and a 

cutoff punch (4), and substantially at the same time, the metal 
wire is chamfered along a next cutting line by a chamfering edge 

(4c-1) so as to form a substantially V-shaped groove extending 
in and along the peripheral surface of a head portion of the 

metal wire and the outside surface of each of two opposed leg 
portion of the metal wire. The next slicing operation produces 

a blank piece which is already chamfered at its upper and lower 
peripheral edges extending along the peripheral surface of the 

head portion and the outside surfaces of respective leg portions 
of the blank piece. A finished coupling element shaped from 

the thus chamfered blank piece is smooth to touch and ensures 
smooth sliding movement of a slider which will guarantee smooth 

opening and closing operation of a slide fastener.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method of 
and an apparatus for successively forming slide-fastener coupling 
elements by transversely cutting or slicing a continuous metal 
wire having a substantially Y-shaped cross section. More particularly, 
this invention concerns such a slide-fastener coupling 
element forming method and apparatus in which simultaneously with 
the cutting, a cut edge of the metal wire is chamfered. In the manufacture of a slide-fastener coupling element 
of the type concerned, a metal wire that has been preformed into 
a Y profile in transverse cross section is fed intermittently. 
While the metal wire is at rest, a cutoff punch and a cutoff die 
are relatively moved to cut or slice the metal wire into a succession 
of blank pieces each having an individual product thickness. 
Subsequently, the head portion of each of the sliced blank 
pieces is shaped by a pocket-forming punch and a head-forming die 
into a coupling head having, on its opposite sides, a protrusion 
and a corresponding pocket. Thus, each blank piece is shaped 
into a finished coupling element. The finished coupling elements  
 
thus produced are collected and after an additional finishing 
process, such as polishing or plating, they are attached by 
clinching to a fastener tape along one longitudinal edge thereof. 
Alternatively, the attachment of the finished coupling elements 
to the fastener tape may be achieved immediately after the 
head-forming process described above. In general, the sharp edges on the press-formed, metal, 
slide-fastener coupling elements may scratch the user's finger 
and tend to hinder smooth movement of a slider in the fastener 
opening and closing directions. To avoid these difficulties, 
one prior attempt to smooth down the edges of the slide-fastener 
coupling elements has involved the barrel polishing of the finished 
coupling elements. According to other prior attempts 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,720,086, edges of the finished 
coupling elements are partially blunted after the coupling elements 
are attached to a fastener tape. The blunting process 
disclosed in the above-mentioned patent publications requires 
a separate apparatus used exclusively for the blunting purpose 
and, hence, the whole coupling-element manufacturing system is 
rendered complicated in construction and the production cost of 
the coupling elements is increased. The prior blunting operation 
may create flushes on cut end surfaces of the individual coupling 
elements. Furthermore, since the

A method of forming a slide-fastener coupling element
