<CLAIMS>
The use of low-foaming compositions containing 
approximately 


0.1 to 50 and preferably 0.1 to 45% by weight of 
alkyl polyglucosides corresponding to the formula 

ROZ
X
 where R = a C₈₋₁₀ alkyl radical, 0 = oxygen, x = 
1 - 6 and preferably 1 - 3 and Z = a sugar unit, 

preferably a glucose or xylose unit, 
 
for cleaning hard surfaces, except crockery, in the 

domestic and institutional sectors, characterized in that 

0.001 to 30 and preferably 0.005 to 20% by weight of 
a C₆₋₁₆ and preferably C₈₋₁₀ fatty alcohol alkoxylate 

with an HLB value above 10 and preferably ≥ 11, 
0.001 to 15 and preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight of 
a C₈₋₂₂ and preferably C₁₀₋₁₈ fatty acid which may even 

be partly or completely neutralized, depending on 
the pH value, and 
optionally auxiliaries typically encountered in 
multipurpose cleaners 
balance to 100% water. 
The use of cleaning compositions as claimed in claim 
1 which additionally contain anionic surfactants in a 

quantity of less than 25% and preferably in a quantity of 
less than 20% of the total quantity of surfactants from 

a) + b) + c).
