<ABSTRACT>
It has been demonstrated that B containing glasses are sensitive to radiation in the band 225-275 nm and, therefore, B2O3 glasses are particularly adapted to receive refractive index modulation, e.g., to make reflection gratings. Glasses containing SiO2 and B2O3 are particularly suitable when the grating is to be localised in the cladding of a fibre. Glasses containing SiO2, GeO2, and B2O3 are suitable when the grating is in the path region of a waveguide, e.g., in the core of a fibre.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical devices which include
refractive index modulation, e.g. reflection gratings.Reflection gratings are often implemented as waveguides
which have a path region and/or a confining region with a
modulated refractive index. The waveguiding structure is
often in the form of a fibre. The modulation preferably
takes the form of alternate regions of higher and lower
refractive index. When radiation traverses the modulation,
it is selectively reflected. The period of the refractive
index modulation is usually equal to the wavelength to be
reflected or to a multiple or sub-multiple of said
wavelength. Thus periods in the range 250 to 600 nm
preferentially reflect selected wavelengths within the
range 800 - 1650 nm.Reflection gratings have many applications in optical
signalling. For example, a reflection grating can be
associated with a fibre laser in order to narrow the lasing
bandwidth. When the refractive index bands are not
perpendicular to the fibre axis, the grating can be used
for the selective removal of unwanted wavelengths. In
addition to reflection gratings, refractive index
modulation has other applications, e.g. to achieve phase
matching in waveguides, to control spot size and/or shape
in waveguides and for storing information.Refractive index modulation is conveniently produced by an
optical process in which a photosensitive glass is exposed
to radiation which causes an adequate change in its
refractive index. The radiation has higher and lower
intensities corresponding to the intended pattern of
modulation of the refractive index of the glass. In many
commonly used embodiments, the mutual interference of two
beams of radiation produces the variation of intensity 
appropriate for reflection gratings. In the case of
information storage, the pattern of radiation relates to
the data to be stored.Silica/germania glasses are widely used in optical
telecommunications and it has been noticed that these
glasses have an optical absorption band extending
approximately over the wavelength range 225 - 275 nm and
exposure to radiation within this band increases the
refractive index of the silica/germania composition. The
peak of the band occurs at a wavelength which is close to
240 nm. It has, therefore, been proposed to produce
refractive index modulation, e. g. to make reflection
gratings, by exposing silica/germania glass compositions to
radiation within the wavelength band 225 - 275 nm.
Radiation close to 240 nm is particularly suitable. High
powers of radiation, e. g. above
