<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compounds which are dinucleotide analogues, their preparation 
and to oligonucleotide analogues incorporating units derived therefrom. For several years there has been interest in structural analogues of natural oligonucleotides 
because of their utility as anti-sense probes for inhibiting gene expression in biological 
systems and as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of viruses such as influenza, herpes and 
HIV, and in the treatment of cancer. Amongst the analogues of recent interest are those in 
which the groups linking the sugar moieties of oligonucleotides are modified by the 
replacement of the 3¹ and 5¹ oxy linkages by other linking groups. WO 91/15499 describes oligonucleotides of formula 
where B is a nucleic acid base; A is -O- or -CH₂-; X and Z are each -O-, -S-, -NH- or 
-CH₂- where X and Z may be the same or different; V and W are =O, =S, =Se, -NH₂, 
alkoxy, -OH or -SH, where V and W may be the same or different in a monomer unit; L is 
-H or a partner of a bonding pair; C is -OR where R is an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group 
optionally substituted by one or more halogen, cyano, carboxy, hydroxy, nitro and/or 
mercapto radicals; and n is any integer. No compounds of the above formula where X and Z are each -CH₂- are disclosed in WO  
 
91/15499 and there is no suggestion as to how such compounds might be prepared. The 
preparation of oligonucleotide analogues in which both the 3¹ oxy linkage and the 5¹ oxy 
linkage are replaced by carbon linkages has remained a significant problem. A method for 
the preparation of such oligonucleotide analogues has now been found. The resulting 
novel compounds have good stability towards nuclease hydrolysis and good hybridisation 
properties, facilitating their use as anti-sense probes and as pharmaceuticals for the 
treatment of viruses such as influenza, herpes and HIV. Accordingly, the present invention provides a dinucleotide analogue of formula 
where
 
B¹ and B² are each independently a monovalent nucleoside base radical;
 
R¹ is R¹a or Z,
 
R¹a, R², R³ and R⁴ are each independently hydrogen, halogen or hydroxy;
 
R⁵ is R⁵a or Z;
 
R⁶ is hydrogen or R⁶a;
 
 
R⁷ is hydrogen, alkyl-N,N-dialkylphosphoramidyl or R⁷a, R⁸ is R⁸a or Z, or the indicated 
R⁷O and R⁸ together denote an isopropylidenedioxy group;
 
R⁵a and R⁸a are each independently hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, -OR¹⁰, -OCOR¹⁰ or 
silyloxy substituted by three C₁-C₁₅ hydrocarbyl groups;
 
R⁶a and R⁷a are each independently a C₁-C₁₀ aliphatic radical, a C₆-C₁₅ aromatic
