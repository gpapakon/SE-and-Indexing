<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of ferronickel from 
nickel containing laterite is provided wherein the 

laterite includes at least a proportion of 
relatively fine material of size less than 10mm. 

The feed material may also be composed 
substantially or entirely of laterite fines or 

dust and also partially treated dust arising from 
conventional treatment routes, and may be 

pre-reduced, optionally after drying. The 
laterite is fed to the central region of the 

molten bath of a circular furnace in which at 
least one electrode in the roof acts as cathode, 

and the molten bath itself acts as anode. The 
process can be used to economically treat fine 

laterite ore previously discarded and stockpiled 
and even formerly non-viable deposits of laterite, 

and fines or dust arising from conventional 
treatment plants.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to the production of
ferronickel from nickel containing laterite and,
more particularly, is concerned with a process
whereby it may be possible to utilise laterite
fines and dust, large quantities of which have
been stockpiled over the years as feedstock.
Possibly more importantly, the invention relates to 
a process in which production costs can be
decreased with the added consequence that
processing of previously uneconomical ore bodies
may become viable.The 'oxidised' ores of nickel constitute by far the
world's largest known reserves of this metal. The
term 'oxidised' is meant to include not only the
true laterites, in which the nickel oxide is
intimately associated with limonitic iron oxide,
but also the silicate ores which often contain the
mineral garnierite. These oxidised ores are found
in regions of the world where tropical weathering
occurs, or where at least sub-tropical conditions
have prevailed in geological times.Mined laterite ore, being of a porous nature, can
hold a large content of free moisture, commonly 25
to 30 percent H2O, although it can contain as much
as 40 percent or more. Moreover, combined water,
which is not driven off until a temperature of 700
to 800째C is reached, can amount to up to 15 per 
cent based on the dry ore weight. This indicates
the necessity of drying and preferably calcining
the ore before smelting.Because of the friable nature of laterites,
run-of-mine ore is normally screened as the first
step of a ferronickel operation. In the screening
operation alone, up to 50 percent undersize
particles may be screened out because of the
difficulties in effecting a physical separation of
wet laterite at a lower size than 6 to 8mm. This
material would then require some form of
agglomeration (e.g. sintering or pelletising)
before further processing. It is conceivable that
the material could be dried before screening to say
1 or 2mm prior to calcining.Lateritic Ni-ferrous ores or garnierite are typically treated by
preheating and/or calcination and/or prereduction before they
entered into the electric furnace or arc furnace for
final reduction (US-A-3535105, FR-A-508 508 or
Handbook of Extractive Metallurgy pp. 759-763, WILEY 1997).However, fines and dust are generated in the drying
process and dust generation in the calcining step
is also increased. In the drying/calcining step
large amounts of fines/dust are generated which are
unsuitable for smelting in a conventional electric
arc furnace. Once again, these fines need to be
extracted and, if they
