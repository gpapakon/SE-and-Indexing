<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to hitherto unknown compounds of formula (I); Y stands for -CH=CH-; R1 is hydrogen or halogen, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine; R2 is halogen, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine, CH3, OCH3, NO2 or CF3, and n=0-3, preferably 0, 1 or 2; A stands for an acidic group, e.g. carboxy, 1-H-tetrazolyl or a hydroxamic acid group. The present compounds are of value in the human and veterinary practice as lipoxygenase inhibitors and/or leukotriene antagonists.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to hitherto unknown 
compounds useful in the human and veterinary therapy, to 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, to bioreversible 
derivatives thereof, to methods for producing said new compounds, 
to pharmaceutical compositions containing the new 
compounds and to the use of said compounds. Leukotrienes, which are formed via the 5-lipoxygenase 
pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, are implicated 
in a variety of pathophysiologic functions, such as bronchoconstriction, 
plasma exudation, coronary artery spasm, 
leukocyte chemotaxis and neutrophil degranulation 1. It is 
therefore of considerable interest to develop compounds 
which inhibit 5-lipoxygenases and thereby the production of 
leukotrienes, or antagonize the effects of leukotrienes. International patent application No. PCT/DK90/00201 
describes a series of quinolyl methoxy substituted N-phenyl 
substituted isoserine (i.e. 3-amino-2-hydroxypropionic 
acid) derivatives with good leukotriene antagonistic activity. Now it has surprisingly turned out that replacement 
of the -CH2O-group with -CH=CH- (trans) and concomitant 
substitution with halogen in the quinoline ring provides 
compounds with even more potent leukotriene antagonistic 
activity, especially in the presence of human serum 
albumin. The present compounds have the general formula I  
 
Y stands for -CH=CH-; R1 is hydrogen or halogen, preferably fluorine, 
chlorine or bromine; R2 is halogen, preferably fluorine, chlorine or 
bromine, CH3, OCH3, NO2 or CF3, and n = 0-3, preferably 0, 
1 or 2; A stands for an acidic group, e.g. carboxy, 1-H-tetrazolyl 
or a hydroxamic acid group. Among the preferred compounds of the invention are 
those of formula I, in which A stands for a carboxy group. The compounds described herein contain more centers 
of asymmetry and may thus give rise to diastereoisomers and 
optical isomers. The present invention is meant to comprehend 
such possible diastereoisomers as well as their 
racemic and resolved optically active forms. The present salts of the compounds of formula I may 
be formed with pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or 
organic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydroiodic 
acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, 
p-toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, formic 
acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, tartaric 
acid, and maleic acid. The present salts of the compounds of formula I may 
also be formed with pharmaceutically acceptable, inorganic 
or organic bases. As
