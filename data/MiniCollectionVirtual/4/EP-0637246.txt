<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of
modified C-reactive protein ("mCRP") for the preparation of a medicament
for the treatment of cancer. The
invention also relates to the use of mCRP as an imaging
agent to identify cancer cells in mammals.It has been estimated that approximately
400,000 deaths each year in the United States are
attributable to cancer. It appears that there is no
single determinant of cancer cell growth and
metastasis. Rather, the propensity of cancer cells to
proliferate and metastasize is the sum total of
numerous cellular characteristics, and individual
cancer cells may use different mechanisms to achieve
the same result [Weiss, Clinical and Experimental
Metastasis, 7:127-167 (1989)].While therapeutic strategies such as surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiation therapy have improved in
recent years [See, e.g., Krakoff, CA-A Cancer Journal
for Clinicians,41:264-278 (1991)], a substantial
number of cancers are resistant to therapy and
ultimately cause the death of the patient. Thus, a
need emerges to discover new and useful means of cancer
therapy. C-reactive protein was first described by
Tillett and Francis [J. Exp. Med., 52:561-71 (1930)]
who observed that sera from acutely ill patients
precipitated with the C-polysaccharide of the cell wall
of Streptococcus pneumonia. Other investigators
subsequently identified the reactive serum factor as
protein, hence the designation "C-reactive protein" or
"CAP." Kilpatrick et al., Immunol. Res.,10:43-53
(1991), provides a recent review of CRP.CRP is a pentameric molecule which consists
of five identical subunits [Osmand et al., Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sciences. U.S.A., 74:739-743 (1977)]. This
pentameric form of CRP is sometimes referred to as
"native CRP."The gene sequence for human CRP has been
cloned [Lei et al., J. Biol. Chem., 260:13377-13383
(1985)]. In addition, the primary sequences for rabbit
CRP [Wang et al., J. Biol. Chem., 257:13610-13615
(1982)] and murine CRP have been reported [Whitehead et
al., Biochem. J., 266:283-290 (1990)], and is under
investigation for rat, dog, horse, goat, and sheep.
Clinical and laboratory observations have determined
that the acute phase response, classically defined by
the well-defined changes of the blood [Pepys et al.,
Advances in Immunology, 34:141-212 (1983)], develops
during various states of disease and injury including
malignant neoplasia, ischemic necrosis, and bacterial,
viral, or fungal parasitic infections. Measurement of
serum acute phase reactants such as CRP have been
utilized in clinical tests
