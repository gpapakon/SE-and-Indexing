<ABSTRACT>
A closed breathing system for divers, comprising a circulation circuit having a supply line (1) and a return line (2) for circulation of breathing gas through the helmet (3) of diver, a pump means (4) for pumping of the breathing gas in the circuit, a gas recovery means (9) arranged in the circuit, and a regulating valve (8) for controlling the breathing gas respectively to and from the diver's helmet (3). The pump (4) is a pneumatic pump which is constructed so that, at any time, it maintains a given relatively small pressure difference between the supply line (1) and the return line (2). In the supply line (1) there is connected a buffer volume (10) maintaining a positive supply pressure, the volume being provided with a means, such as a pneumatic cylinder (11), creating a counter-pressure on the gas in the buffer volume (10), and the regulating valve (8) is arranged to be operated under the influence of very small pressure variations in the helmet (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
 A closed breathing system for diversThe invention relates to a closed breathing system for divers, comprising a circulation circuit having a supply line and a return line for circulation of breathing gas through the helmet of a diver, a pump means for pumping of the breathing gas in the circuit, a gas recovery means arranged in the circuit, and a regulating valve for controlling the breathing gas respectively to and from the diver's helmet.In the later years it has become increasingly more necessary to be able to carry out operational diving at great depths. It has turned out that substantial problems are connected with such activity, and the problems are strongly increasing with the depth. Economic circumstances make it necessary to base oneself on systems which are able to recover and recirculate the breathing gas. The recovery normally takes place at the surface, and with traditional valve technology the recirculation requires a considerable energy consumption. Further, it has turned out to be problematic to procure a breathing system which is ergonomic, which is sufficiently easy to breathe with at large depths, and which in addition ensures sufficient escape time for the diver in case of interruptions in the gas supply etc. It has also turned out to be problematic to achieve a satisfactory communica- tion, since noise in gas regulating valves etc. increases strongly with the depth.Generally, there are two types of closed breathing systems for diving. One type is based on the demand principle, which is characterized in that the diver breathes through an oral-nasal mask, and breathing valves control the supply and return of breathing gas in accurate correspondence with the diver's demand. The use of an oral-nasal mask gives poorer ergonomics, but is necessary in order to avoid a high C02 level in the breathing gas. The other type of closed breathing system is based on free flow of the breathing gas. Here the diver breathes directly from the helmet, the resilient neck seal of the helmet being used as a buffer volume (breathing bag). In such breathing systems the C02 content is maintained at an acceptable level in that fresh gas continuously flows through the helmet. 

 A general disadvantage of free flow is a high noise level and communication problems at great depths. Moreover, a considerable energy quantity is required in order to recirculate the conti¬ nuous gas flow. Some producers have tried to reduce the energy s demand by moving the electrical pump system downwards to a diving bell or a
