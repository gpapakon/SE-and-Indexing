<ABSTRACT>
A transfer sheet (1) prepared by prelaminating, in a 
releasable manner, a transfer layer having a prescribed 

pattern, design or the like, printed onto one side of a base 
material (2), is laid on or attached to the surface of a concrete-placing 

form, with the printed side facing the concrete-placing 
side, and then an adhesive is applied onto the transfer layer 

side and the transfer layer is transferred to the surface (9) of 
the concrete (8) at the time of removal of the form after the 

concrete is placed and cured in the form. Furthermore, an 
adhesive is applied to either side or both sides of the surface 

of existing concrete and the surface of the transfer layer of 
a transfer sheet (1) and the transfer layer is pressed facing the 

surface of the concrete for contact bonding, and the adhesive 
layer is allowed to set, after which the substrate of the 

transfer sheet is released to transfer the transfer layer onto 
the surface of the concrete.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of creating a 
concrete surface pattern finish to be used in the fields of 
construction and civil engineering, and more specifically, it 
relates to a method of constructing a pattern finish in which 
a transfer sheet with a pattern printed thereon using an 
advanced plate-making technique is employed to convey the 
pattern onto the surface of a structure by adhesion at the same 
time the concrete form is removed during the building of the 
concrete structure, or at an appropriate time for an existing 
concrete structure. A common method of creating a finish onto a structure made 
of concrete or the like is performed by applying or spraying a 
finishing paint, or attaching tiles or bricks onto the 
structure after the substrate has been conditioned. Reflective 
of the diversification of decorative structures, finishing 
methods are often employed which require advanced skill  
 
techniques, such as methods of stone pitching with marble or 
rock, relief pattern finishing which uses a special resin form 
to provide an uneven surface, and terracotta finishing which 
mainly aims at producing a three-dimensional ornamental effect. Further, in recent years numerous variations have been 
employed for the purpose of harmony with the surrounding view 
and environment, for applications ranging from civil 
engineering structures other than concrete buildings to 
temporary structures at building sites. For example, there may 
be seen in great abundance flowers, animals, symbolic marks and 
the like painted on temporary walls placed for delineation of 
boundary lines and safety and preservation during construction, 
rock designs protruding from concrete dikes on both sides of 
rivers which run through the city, and ceramic murals 
symbolizing the local area, created at the fronts of entrances 
of tunnels of roads, etc. However, these artful finishing methods have required 
advanced skills and much labor and time in order to achieve 
more elegant decoration and more natural patterns. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
solution to the above disadvantages, by easily and economically 
forming a copy of various highly-precise, patterns, designs, 
etc. which are displayed by printing on the inner side of a  
 
transfer sheet, onto the inside or outside of the structure to 
be decorated by their transfer thereon, such as concrete 
structures, at the time of removal of the form after placing 
and curing for setting of the concrete, or at an appropriate 
time onto

A method of creating a concrete surface pattern finish, 
characterized in that a transfer sheet prepared by 

prelaminating, in a releasable manner, a transfer layer having 
a printed side on which is printed a prescribed pattern, design 

or the like, onto one side of a base material, is laid on or 
attached to the surface of a concrete-placing form, in such a 

manner that said printed side faces the concrete-placing side, 
and then an adhesive is applied onto the transfer layer side 

and the transfer layer is transferred to the surface of the 
concrete at the time of removal of the form after the concrete 

is placed and cured in the form. 
A method of creating a concrete surface pattern finish, 
characterized in that an adhesive is applied to either side or 

both sides of the surface of existing concrete and the surface 
of a transfer layer of a transfer sheet which has been 

laminated in a releasable manner with said transfer layer 
comprising a substrate on one side of which there has been 

printed a desired pattern, design or the like, and the transfer 
layer is pressed facing the surface of the concrete for contact 

bonding, and the adhesive layer is allowed to set, after which
