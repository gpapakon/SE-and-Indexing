<ABSTRACT>
A method of alkylating the side chain of alkyl-substituted 
aromatic hydrocarbons. The method comprises the 

steps of thermally treating an alumina by calcining in air and 
then degassing under vacuum to prepare an alumina carrier, 

loading an alkaline metal on the alumina carrier by an 
impregnation method using the alkaline metal dissolved in 

liquid ammonia, thermally treating the alkaline metal loaded 
alumina carrier under vacuum to prepare a catalyst, then 

reacting an alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon with an 
aliphatic monoolefin, using the catalyst, under an atmosphere 

substantially free of oxygen, water and carbon dioxide gas to 
alkylate the side chain of the alkyl-substituted aromatic 

hydrocarbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of alkylating
the side chain of alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons.
More specifically, the present invention relates, for instance,
to the economical production of 2-methyl-1-(p-tolyl)-butane by
alkylation of the side chains of p-xylene with butene. By
conducting a cyclic dehydration, the 2-methyl-1-(p-tolyl)-butane
can form 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene, which is an
industrially useful, polymerizable raw material. Thus, the
present invention relates to an economical synthesis method for
industrially useful, alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbons.The alkylating reaction for the side chain of alkyl-substituted
aromatic hydrocarbons by aliphatic monoolefins is
conventionally well known (e.g., H. Pines 5, J. Am. Chem. Soc.,
vol. 77 (1955)). However, this method is disadvantageous in
that used sodium cannot be recovered, and a large amount
thereof is necessary since metallic sodium is directly added to
the reaction solution and is used in a suspended state.To avoid this disadvantage, a variety of methods have
been proposed to load an alkaline metal on a carrier for
solidification. For example, U.K. Patent 1,269,280 and JP-A-61-221133
propose the use of a potassium carbonate loaded 
sodium, JP-A-62-209027 proposes the use of a potassium
phosphate loaded sodium, JP-A-2-138229 (corresponding to U.S.
Patent 5,347,062) proposes the use of a potassium hydroxide-alumina
loaded potassium, JP-A-2-178236 (corresponding to U.S.
Patent 5,227,559) proposes the use of an alumina loaded
potassium, JP-A-3-264539 (U.S. Patent 5,118,895) proposes the
use of a magnesia loaded potassium, JP-A-3-227944 (U.S. Patent
5,097,088) proposes the use of a magnesia-alumina loaded
potassium, etc. (The term "JP-A" as used herein means
"unexamined published Japanese patent application".) In these
proposals, the use of aliphatic monoolefins such as ethylene,
propylene and butene is examined, and the reactivity decreases
in the order of ethylene > propylene > butene, thus the
reactivity of butene is lowest.With respect to a conventional catalyst, a catalyst in
which an alkaline metal is loaded on a basic carrier has a high
activity, but it is disadvantageous in that the basic carrier
has such a small specific area that the alkaline metal loaded
thereon is not sufficiently dispersed. On the other hand, an
alumina catalyst in which an alkaline metal is loaded on
alumina has a large specific area and shows a good
dispersibility for the loaded metal. However, because of the
acidic nature of alumina, the
