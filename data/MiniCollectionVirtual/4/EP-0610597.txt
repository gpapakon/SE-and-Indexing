<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing a tabular silver halide 
emulsion involves growing a silver halide seed emulsion 

in which tabular silver halide grains having an aspect 
ratio of 2 to 12 account for 50% to 100% of a total projected 

area of all silver halide grains of the seed 
emulsion, to prepare a grown tabular silver halide 

emulsion in which tabular silver grains having an aspect 
ratio of 3 to 40 account for 50% to 100% of a total 

projected area of all silver halide grains of the grown 
emulsion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing 
a tabular silver halide emulsion, and a silver 
halide light-sensitive material which uses the tabular 
silver halide emulsion and is improved in production 
stability and sensitivity. Tabular silver halide emulsions exhibit a high sensitivity 
in spectral sensitization range, and provide a 
high sharpness. However, it is difficult to prepare 
only desired grains stably. A process of grain formation of tabular grains is 
generally a complicated process of short-time rush addition 
- Ostwald ripening - ripening using a silver halide 
solvent - growth. If, therefore, variations exit in the 
individual steps, the shape and the performance of final 
grains vary largely. For this reason, a batch difference 
in the preparation is large in performance of 
tabular grains, so it is impossible to successively 
obtain grains with a stable performance in many cases. 
In the preparation of tabular grains, the shape and the 
performance of the grains largely depend on particularly 
nucleation performed by short-time rush addition - 
Ostwald ripening - ripening using a silver halide 
solvent. In the formation of tabular grains, since 
selective formation of tabular grains alone is 
impossible in nucleation, it is necessary to perform the 
Ostwald ripening and the step of extinguishing grains  
 
except for tabular grains by using a silver halide 
solvent described above. Batch differences in these 
steps, however, are particularly large to cause 
variations in the shape of tabular grains, making it 
difficult to stably obtain grains with a high aspect 
ratio and a high monodispersity. As a method of solving these problems, a seed crystal 
method is known in which a large amount of grains 
finished up to grain growth are prepared as seed crystal 
grains in the same batch, and a portion of the seed 
crystal grains thus prepared is used to perform the 
steps after the grain growth. As a method of preparing 
octahedral emulsion grains according to the seed crystal 
method, JP-A-1-15234 discloses a method in which 
octahedral seed crystals are prepared, and a core/shell 
emulsion is formed by using them. As a method of preparing 
cubic emulsion grains, JP-A-1-131542 describes 
a method in which monodisperse cubic seed crystal grains 
are prepared in advance, and shells are grown by using a 
portion of these grains. As a method of forming tabular 
grains according to the seed crystal method, 
JP-B-3-46811 discloses a method in which spherical seed 
crystals are formed
