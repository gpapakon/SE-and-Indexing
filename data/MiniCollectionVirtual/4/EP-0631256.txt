<ABSTRACT>
A handwriting capture system includes a segmented 
digitizer and circuitry which processes handwriting 

information entered into the segmented digitizer, a 
controller (14) which determines position coordinates 

associated with the handwriting information, a memory (16) 
coupled to the controller which stores position coordinates, 

and circuitry (13) coupled between the controller (14) and 
the segmented digitizer (12) which drives and calibrates the 

segmented digitizer (12). The system also includes a host 
computer system (24) coupled to the controller (14) through 

an interface (22) so that the controller (14) can upload 
positional coordinates to the host system (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to digitizer input services.The invention also relates to a method of operating a digitizer input device.An example of a commercially available digitizer is the Bradytouch four-wire
membrane digitizer panel from Dynapro Thin Films Division of Milwaukee, Wisconson.
Another example of a commercially available digitizer is the AccuTouch five-wire
membrane digitizer panel from Elographics of Oak Ridge, Tennessee.Such membrane digitizers are ideal in applications that require sensitivity to both
stylus and finger, low cost, and a passive stylus. "Passive stylus" is the one which has no
electronics or moving parts.Unfortunately, conventional membrane digitizers also have several drawbacks. Chief
among them is its lack of "hand rejection", which is the ability to ignore a user's hand while
the user is writing with a stylus. Touching the digitizer with a finger while writing with a
stylus yields unpredictable digitizer data. US-A-4 638 118, which represents the basis for the preambles of claims 1 and 6, discloses a digitizer where the
different segments of the touch surface are scanned simultaneously to allow rapid
determination of the co-ordinates of writing stimuli. Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 016,
no. 532 (P-1448), 30 October 1992 & JP 04 199416 A (SHARP CORP), 20 July 1992 and

(TOSHIBA CORP), 4 March 1992, disclose image display devices where a touch pen input
is distinguished from a finger input by detecting the size of the touch area and the pressure
applied at the touch position respectively.It is an object of the present invention to provide a digitizer input device and method
of operating such a device which are largely immune finger or hand contact.Therefore according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
digitizer input device comprising:
a plurality of segments for entering handwritten information and position
determining means for determining the positional co-ordinates of actuation of one of
said segments, characterized byresistance measurement means for determining the contact resistance Rc at
the point of actuation; and means for determining an operation actuating status of said digitizer input
device.According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of
operating a digitizer input device including a plurality of segments comprising the steps of
determining the positional co-ordinates of actuation of one of said segments, characterized
