An electrical coffee maker comprising water heater means, a tank 
(1), a water-raising tube (2) indirectly connecting the tank (1) to a 

dispenser chamber (3) provided with a water dispenser orifice (25), a 
water recycling duct connecting the dispenser chamber (3) to the tank 

(1), and a control valve (30) for opening or closing the dispenser 
orifice (25) serving, in the closed position, to enable water to be 

recycled via the recycling duct, the recycling duct being constituted 
by a chute (16) within wh
ich the water-raising tube (2) extends, the 
coffee maker being characterized in that the chute (16) extends at 

least in part within the tank (1). 
A coffee maker according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
dispenser chamber (3) is situated above a filter carrier. 
A coffee maker according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
chute (16) extends from the dispenser chamber (3) substantially to 

the bottom (8) of the tank (1) and comes to an end in the vicinity of 
said bottom. 
A coffee maker according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the water-raising tube (2) extends from the 

dispenser chamber (3) over substantially the full height of the chute 
(16). 
A coffee maker according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the tank (1) includes a water outlet hole (7) 

formed through its bottom (18) within the chute (16). 
A coffee maker according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the dispenser chamber (3) includes at least one 

preheating chimney (20) for passing vapor downstream from said 
chamber. 
A coffee maker according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
dispenser chamber (3) includes three preheating chimneys (20) 

disposed at the periphery of said chamber and each possessing a vapor  
 

inlet (22) close to the top wall (15) of said chamber (3) and a vapor 
outlet (21). 
A coffee maker according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the dispenser chamber (3) includes a vapor 

recovery partition (18b) in the vicinity of the overflow orifice (17) 
of the chute (16). 
A coffee maker according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the control valve (30) is a bimetallic cup (31) 

mounted to move resiliently in sealed compression against the 
dispenser orifice (25) for the purpose of releasing it or closing it. 
A coffee maker according to claim 9, characterized in that the 
bimetallic cup (31) is mounted to bear in sealed manner via its 

periphery against a sealing lip (26) surrounding the dispenser 
orifice (25).
