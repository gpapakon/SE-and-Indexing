<ABSTRACT>
A device for supplying electrical energy to at least one electrical installation appliance (service appliance) in an installation distributor has phase busbars (rails) which are assigned to the individual phases and can be connected to the installation appliances corresponding with the associated phase. The phase busbars are accommodated in a housing or a block made of insulating material. They are constructed as flat strip conductors (ribbon conductors) and have connecting tabs which can make contact with the installation appliances. The phase busbars and the connecting tabs are in this case completely accommodated in a housing or are potted in such a housing, openings being provided in the housing through which connecting conductors (which are integrally formed on the installation appliances) can be passed to the connecting tabs and can make contact with the connecting tabs. The housings have strips which run in the longitudinal direction and form a top-hat section profiled rail (DIN-standard rail) with one another onto which installation appliances can be snapped. Located on the mounting side of the installation appliances are connecting elements which engage through the openings when the appliances are snapped onto the strips and are connected to the connecting tabs. It is no longer necessary to adjust the connecting elements on the installation appliances, as a result of the mutual arrangement of the connecting tabs.
