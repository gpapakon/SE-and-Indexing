<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a substrate for
an ink jet recording head, a recording head using the
substrate, a recording apparatus with the recording
head, and a method of driving the recording head.Nowadays, various recording methods have been
developed and are available. Of these methods, ink jet
recording methods for performing recording by emitting
an ink from emission ports in accordance with a
recording signal are popularly used since the apparatus
used in these methods can be easily rendered compact
and generates low noise. Among these methods, a method
using electro-thermal energy conversion elements for
applying heat to an ink to cause a bubble forming
phenomenon as emission energy generation elements for
emitting an ink is preferably used.An ink jet recording head of this type has an
element substrate on which first resistor elements (ink
emission resistor elements) as electro-thermal energy
conversion elements, which are electrically connected 
to a function element for selectively driving a
plurality of electro-thermal energy conversion elements
for emitting an ink, as described above, and second
resistor elements (temperature control resistor
elements), which are arranged for adjusting the
viscosity of the ink by controlling the temperature,
and are not electrically connected to the function
element, are formed.When the resistance values of the first resistor
elements formed on the element substrate suffer a
variation in the manufacture, if a common driving
voltage is applied to the respective heads, different
amounts of heat are generated due to a variation in
resistance value, resulting in different ink bubble
forming phenomena. Thus, ink emission amounts become
nonuniform in units of heads, or stable ink emission
cannot often be attained. Therefore, the resistance
values of the emission resistor elements of the
respective heads must be measured by some method, and
voltages corresponding to the measured resistance
values must be applied to suppress emission amount
nonuniformity. However, when the resistance value of
the emission resistor element of each head is to be
directly measured, a resistance value including the
resistance value of the emission resistor element and
that of the function element electrically connected
thereto is undesirably measured. As a result, the 
resistance value of only the emission resistor element
cannot be accurately measured.For this reason, the present inventors measured
the resistance value of the temperature control
resistor element which was
