<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides crystals of L-phenylalanine 
monomethyl sulfate which have low solubility 

compared to L-tyrosine and D-phenylalanine. The 
L-phenylalanine monomethylsulfate crystals are obtained by 

subjecting a solution containing monomethyl sulfuric acid 
and phenylalanine to crystallization. 
Further, the present invention also provides a process 
for recovering L-phenylalanine from a water layer by 

neutralizing the esterified reaction, extracting an ester 
of L-phenylalanine therefrom with an organic solvent, and 

recovering remaining L-phenylalanine in the water layer as 
L-phenylalanine monomethylsulfate. L-phenylalanine 

monomethyl sulfate is obtained by esterifying 
L-phenylalanine and methanol in the presence of sulfuric 

acid, neutralizing the esterified solution with a base in 
the presence of water, extracting the produced L-phenylalanine 

methyl ester from the neutralized solution 
with an organic solvent, and then crystallized the 

resultant water layer under acidic condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
L-phenylalanine and its methyl ester, L-phenylalanine 
methyl ester are useful intermediates in peptide synthesis. 
The demand for these compounds in recent years has 
increased because they are also starting materials in the 
synthesis of α-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester, a 
popular sweetener. This invention relates to a novel 
process for recovering L-phenylalanine from syntheses by 
formation of optically active L-phenylalanine 
monomethylsulfate crystals. For convenience, the abbreviations used hereinafter 
are summarized in the following Table: 
Compound Abbreviation L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl esterL-L-APM α-aspartyl-phenylalanine methyl esterα-APM α-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl esterα-L-L-APM L-aspartic acidL-Asp L-phenylalanineL-Phe D-phenylalanineD-Phe DL-phenylalanineDL-Phe L-tyrosineL-Tyr L-phenylalanine methyl esterL-PM L-phenylalanine monomethyl sulfateL-Phe·CH3SO4H  Conventional L-phenylalanine syntheses produce a 
product whose quality is low due to the presence of two 
impurities. For example, when L-Phe is prepared by 
fermentation, it is usually contaminated with L-Tyr, also 
present in the fermentation broth, and with D-Phe, an 
optical isomer of L-Phe. It is known that L-Phe can be selectively crystallized 
from L-Tyr by derivatizing the carboxy or amino terminus of 
L-Phe (for example with L-phenylalanine 1 sodium 5 hydrate 
as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 60-13746 or 
L-phenylalanine 1/2 sulfate 1/2 hydrate as disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 56-79652). However, the 
solubility of crystals of these L-Phe derivatives increases 
during crystallization resulting in losses of product into 
the mother liquor and thus decreased yields. In order to 
achieve higher yields, crystallization must be performed at 
high concentrations of L-Phe. As a result, the force 
necessary to stir the aqueous slurry increases. 
Additionally, impurities in the mother liquor can adhere to 
the isolated crystals. D-Phe is produced as a result of racemization of L-Phe 
under the high-temperature and alkaline conditions used to 
treat the fermentation broth. D-Phe is also produced as a 
result of racemization during manufacturing processes which 
use L-Phe or L-Phe derivatives as starting materials. D-Phe 
is also produced during attempts to recover L-Phe from  
 
these processes (L-Phe is frequently recovered by removing 
any derivatizing groups by suitable methods such as 
hydrolysis). Unfortunately, D-Phe produced during the manufacture 
of L-Phe is difficult to
