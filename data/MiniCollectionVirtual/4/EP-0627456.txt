<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a vulcanized rubber-synthetic resin 
composite structure which comprises forming a layer of a curable 

adhesive on the surface of the vulcanized rubber molding, said 
curable adhesive being composed mainly of chlorosulfonated 

polyethylene, disposing the vulcanized rubber molding in the 
heated state in a mold, injecting a molten resin into the mold, 

and demolding the composite structure after the setting of the 
injected resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a 
vulcanized rubber-synthetic resin composite structure, and more 
particularly, to a process for producing a vulcanized rubber-synthetic 
resin composite structure in which the vulcanized 
rubber and the synthetic resin are bonded extremely firmly to 
each other. Industrial rubber products are often used in the form of 
rubber-metal composite structure. Recently, metals for this 
purpose are being supplanted by the recently developed 
engineering plastics which have outstanding mechanical strength, 
heat resistance, oil resistance, and creep resistance. As a 
result, new application areas are being opened up by the rubber-synthetic 
resin composite structure. An example of such application areas is the automotive 
suspension rod. The conventional metal rod with rubber bushings 
is being supplanted by the plastics rod with rubber bushings 
whose plan view is shown in Fig. 1 and whose sectional view taken 
through section II-II of Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 2. There are 
shown a rod proper 2 made of plastics (such as polyamide resin), 
a bushing 3 made of vulcanized rubber, and a steel bearing 4. The 
rubber bushings 3 attached to both ends of the rod 1 are intended 
to reduce the torsional rigidity, and the rod 1 is joined to the 
automotive body through the bushings 3 and steel bearings 4. The rubber-synthetic resin composite structure is usually  
 
produced by curing a desired part of unvulcanized rubber in 
contact with the surface of the synthetic resin moldings to which 
a chlorine-containing vulcanizable adhesive has been applied. 
According to the disclosure of Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 
104717/1987, the plastics rod with rubber bushings as shown in 
Figs. 1 and 2 is produced by disposing the bushings of vulcanized 
rubber in a mold and injecting a melt of a synthetic resin into 
the mold. GB-691252 discloses a process for making composite articles 
which comprises subjecting the surface of a soft-vulcanized 
rubber component to chemical modification, bringing said modified 
surface into contact with a rigid component with a bonding layer 
therebetween and hardening the bonding layer whilst pressing the 
rubber component against the rigid component. Needless to say, firm bonding between rubber and resin is 
very important for the rubber-resin composite structure. In the 
case of the plastics rod with rubber bushings, the plastics rod 
proper and the rubber bushing should be bonded extremely firmly 
to each other. Unfortunately, adhesion
