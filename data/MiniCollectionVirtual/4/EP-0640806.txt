<ABSTRACT>
A sensor window compliant mounting assembly 
(42), such as used in a missile (20) to protect a 

sensor (40), has a truncated hemispherical sensor 
dome window (52) and a dome mount housing (60). The 

dome mount housing (60) includes a hollow tube (62) 
with an opening (64), an internal circumferential 

thread (66) adjacent to the opening (64), and an 
integral bezel retainer ring (68) extending 

circumferentially around the opening (64). The bezel 
retainer ring (68) engages and retains the exterior 

surface (56) of the dome base (54). A spanner nut 
(72) is threadably engaged to the internal 

circumferential thread (66) of the dome mount housing 
(60), and a partially compressed fiber metal washer 

(74) reacts between the spanner nut (72) and the 
lower surface (58) of the dome base (54) to bias the 

sensor dome window (52) toward the bezel retainer 
ring (68).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the mounting of 
sensor windows used to protect sensors, and, more 
particularly, to a compliant mounting assembly that 
permits the mounting and window to be heated to 
elevated temperature without loss of mounting and 
protective integrity. Various types of optical, electro-optical, 
infrared, acoustic, and radar sensors are used in 
missiles, aircraft, and other applications to sense 
the environment and especially to search for 
targets. The sensor itself is usually rather 
delicate and must be protected from aerodynamic 
forces, dirt, heat, and other external agents that 
could damage it. A protective sensor window that is 
transparent to the energy sensed by the sensor is 
placed over the sensor to protect it. The sensor 
window is held in place by a window mounting 
assembly. In one application, an infrared sensor is 
protected by a infrared-transparent ceramic window in 
the shape of a truncated dome that fits over the 
sensor and is held in place in a metallic mounting. 
In conventional practice, an adhesive is used to bond 
the protective window to the mounting assembly. 
However, in some cases the sensor system is to be 
used in an aerodynamic environment where it may be 
heated to temperatures as high as 1200°F. At such 
temperatures, conventional adhesives soften and are 
incapable of holding the protective window in place. 
Moreover, the differences in thermal expansion 
coefficients between the ceramic window and the 
metallic mounting may cause the window to become  
 
loose in the mounting so that hot gas could penetrate 
to the sensor and damage it. Tests using such a 
conventional approach have led to mounting-related 
failures. There is a need for an improved sensor window 
assembly for a wide variety of sensor systems. The 
sensor window assembly should withstand elevated 
temperatures without loss of mounting integrity and 
protective function. The present invention fulfills 
this need, and further provides related advantages. The present invention provides a sensor window 
mounting assembly that securely retains the sensor 
window in place. The assembly may be heated to 
elevated temperatures without loss of structural or 
protective functions. The assembly of the invention 
is fully compatible with existing sensor designs and 
mechanical constraints imposed by the surrounding 
structure. In accordance with the invention, a sensor 
window compliant mounting assembly comprises a sensor 
window having a window base with an exterior surface 
and a lower
