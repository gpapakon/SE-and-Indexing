<ABSTRACT>
A bicycle rear derailleur (1) is provided for shifting a 
chain (C) from one sprocket to another of a multiple freewheel (F) 

which includes a plurality of sprockets (S1-S6) each having a 
lowermost edge portion. The derailleur (1) comprises a control 

mechanism (8) pivotally mounted to a bicycle frame (E) by a first 
pivot shaft (4) which is parallel to a hub shaft (2), and a chain 

guide (7) pivotally mounted to the control mechanism (8) by a 
second pivot shaft (21) which is parallel to the hub shaft (4). 

The chain guide (7) rotataby supports an upper guide wheel (5) and 
a lower tension wheel (6). The chain guide (7) is biased in a 

chain tensioning direction by a spring and controlled by the 
control mechanism (8) to move axially of the hub shaft (2). The 

guide wheel (5) has an uppermost edge portion located ahead of the 
lowermost edge portion of each sprocket which the chain (C) 

engages. The control mechanism (8) is freely pivotable about the 
first pivot shaft (4) without any spring bias at least within a 

predetermined range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bicycle rear derailleurs
for shifting a chain from one sprocket to another of a multiple
freewheel according to the preambles of claim 1 and 6.Such derailleurs are known from FR-A-2543639.As is well known, a bicycle rear derailleur is provided
adjacent to a freewheel for shifting a chain from one sprocket to
another sprocket of the freewheel. A typical prior art rear
derailleur is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,610,644 for example.Specifically, the prior art derailleur of the above U.S.
patent comprises a chain guide and a pantograph linkage assembly
for moving the chain guide axially of the rear hub shaft on which
the multiple freewheel is rotatably mounted. The chain guide
rotatably supports an upper guide wheel and a lower tension wheel.
The pantograph linkage assembly comprises a base member pivotally
mounted to a rear fork end of the bicycle frame by a first pivot
shaft, inner and outer links having their respective base ends
pivotally connected to the base member by first and second pins,
and a movable member pivotally connected to the respective free
ends of the inner and outer links by third and fourth pins. The
movable member pivotally supports the chain guide by a second
pivot shaft. The first to fourth pins are located at the four 
corners of a parallelogram.The base member of the pantograph linkage assembly is
pivotally biased rearward by a first coil spring mounted on the
first pivot shaft. Similarly, the chain guide is pivotally
biased rearward by a second coil spring mounted on the second
pivot shaft. Thus, the chain in engagement with the guide and
tension wheels of the chain guide is tensioned by the first and
second coil springs. The derailleur incorporating the two chain
tensioning springs is said to have a double-tension mechanism.Further, each of the first to fourth pins of the pantograph
linkage assembly is inclined so that its lower end is located
laterally outwardly from its inner end. As a result, when the
pantograph linkage assembly is deformed to move the chain guide
laterally inward, the chain guide also moves downwardly. Due to
the inclination or slanting of the pins, the pantograph linkage
assembly is referred to as a "slant pantograph linkage assembly".The prior art derailleur having the slant pantograph linkage
assembly and the double tension mechanism has been found to work
well with respect to a certain range of freewheels if the first
and second coil springs are properly adjusted in their respective
spring force. However, the prior art
