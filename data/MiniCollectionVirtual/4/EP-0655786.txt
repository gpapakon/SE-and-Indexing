<ABSTRACT>
In a method of making a semiconductor apparatus 
which is capable of controlling fluctuations of the 

effective length of the conduction area which occurs at 
making, and a semiconductor apparatus using this 

method, the edge of the first and/or second electric 
conduction film is formed by self adjustment to the 

trench, and the position of the edge of impurity 
diffusion zone is formed by self adjustment to the edge 

of electric conduction film. Thus, the fluctuation of 
effective length of the conduction area can be avoided. 

Resultingly, a highly efficient semiconductor apparatus 
can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
method of making a semiconductor apparatus, and more
particularly to an improvement in the method of making a highly efficient MOS
electrode effect transistor.An important problem which is attended with the
recent miniaturization and higher efficiency of MOS
electrode effect transistor is how to suppress the
short channel effect. As one approach to cope with this problem a gate mounted MOS electrode
effect transistor technique has been proposed.This technique suppresses the short channel effect
by digging down the silicon substrate in the channel
area and increasing virtually the channel length, and
furthermore, improves the hot carrier resistance by
moving the channel area away from the source and drain 
parts.Figs. 1A and 1B show a processing flow of this
technique. This is a cross sectional view of an N-channel
MOS transistor formed on the silicon
substrate. As shown in Fig. 1A, a LOCOS oxide film 2 for
separating elements is formed on the silicon substrate
1 and then a shallow trench 3 is formed in the channel
area.Then a gate oxide film 4 is formed on the surface
of the substrate including the inner part of the trench
with the aid of rapid thermal technique using an oxide
diffusing furnace. In this connection, the LOCOS oxide
film 2 is formed with a thickness of 400 to 500 nm and
the gate oxide film is formed with a thickness of 10 to 20 nm.At this step boron ions are introduced in
order to control the threshold voltage Vth.Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1B, an N+ polysilicon
film of 200 to 400 nm thickness is piled up in the
trench 3 and on the surface of the substrate by CVD. Then,
polysilicon is processed with the aid of existing dry
etching technique to form a gate electrode 5 of MOS
transistor.Then, N+ ions are introduced into the MOS transistor 
unit and a source diffusion zone 6 and a drain
diffusion zone 7 are formed. Then, the source
diffusion zone 6 and the drain diffusion zone 7 are
activated by thermal processing and furthermore,
each electrode is formed using an existing wiring
technique (not shown). The MOS transistor is formed
according to the procedure described above.However, since it is necessary to fit the
positions of electrode edges and the shallow trench 3
in the case of processing the gate electrode as shown
in Fig. 1B, there is a possibility that the effective
gate length Leff varies. Therefore,
there has been a problem that
characteristic scattering increases and the improvement of the
integration factor is thus prevented.The JP-A-5 206 459
