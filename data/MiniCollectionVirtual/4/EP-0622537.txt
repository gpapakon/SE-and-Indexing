<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to engine 
controllers and, more particularly to, a power supply for 
a single board engine controller. The energy crisis of the 1970's has forced 
automotive engine designers to turn to computer technology 
to improve fuel economy. Today, sophisticated on-board 
computers, called engine controllers, monitor engine-related 
operating variables such as intake and exhaust 
manifold temperature and pressure, engine temperature, 
coolant temperature and pressure, throttle position, engine 
timing, air and fuel flow, engine RPM, transmission gear 
selection, ambient pressure and temperature, as well as 
other operating variables. The engine controller uses the 
data from these operating variables to maximize engine 
performance, increase efficiency and minimize exhaust 
emissions under a variety of engine operating conditions. Generally, the engine controller includes a power 
supply which has the demanding task of supplying the 
controller with the proper amount of electric power under 
greatly varying engine operating conditions. As such, the 
power supply must be able to regulate power under high and 
low load conditions on the engine controller. The power 
supply must also have the capability of supplying enough  
 
power to the engine controller for engine ignition to 
occur. The power supply relies totally on a vehicle 
battery for its source of power and, therefore, must be 
able to regulate its output voltage when the vehicle 
battery voltage is as low as 4.5 wHs (cold start voltage) 
and when the vehicle battery voltage is as high as 24 volts 
(series battery jump start). Typically, conventional timer 
pulsed power supply circuits are unable to vary the 
position of the output voltage pulse throughout the wide 
range of frequencies required in applications for the 
engine controller to provide adequate power regulation. 
Thus, there is a need in the art to provide an engine 
controller power supply which can supply adequate power 
during low battery voltage engine startup and precise 
regulation during high battery voltage engine startup. 
Also, there is a need in the art to provide a pulsed power 
supply for an engine controller. It is, therefore, one object of the present 
invention to provide a power supply for an engine 
controller. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a power supply for a single board engine controller 
which will supply the necessary amount of power during high 
or low battery voltage conditions facilitating
