<DESCRIPTION>
 SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM UTILIZING VOCABULARY MODEL PRESELECTIONBackground of the InventionThe present invention relates to speech recognition and more particularly to methods for preselecting or screening candidate models for accurate matching with an unknown speech segment.In order to be useful for many user applications, a speech recognition system should be capable of recognizing a large vocabulary of words. Distinguishing between words in a large vocabulary system requires that the system be capable of a high degree of accuracy in comparing an unknown speech segment with the models representing the vocabulary words. As is understood, high accuracy carries with it a substantial cost in terms of computational complexity and, while various techniques have been evolving for efficiently doing the necessary calculations, it has been becoming increasingly necessary to provide some method of screening or preselecting candidate models prior to applying a high precision matching algorithm. The present invention utilizes several novel methods to effect preselection of candidate models in such a way that unlikely candidates are quickly weeded out with minimal risk of eliminating the best matches. Summary of the InventionThe unknown speech segment is represented by a fine sequence of frames and the vocabulary models are represented by the respective fine sequences of states. Preferably, the model states are drawn from a limited collection of predeterminedstates. Both the unknown segment and the models are subsampled to obtain respective coarse sequences which are used in the 

screening distance measuring functions of the present invention. The subsa pled sequences in effect define a matrix for each comparison.In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a table is precalculated for each unknown speech segment. The table holds, for each state in the limited collection, a measure of the degree of match of the subsampled input frame which provides the best match with that state in each possible state position. Preferably, the selection of best match is made without constraining the choice on the basis of adjacent states in the coarse sequence, a time warping constraint usually imposed in matching calculations, e.g. in accordance with Viterbi decoding. Accordingly, for each model to be considered, a cumulative value representing the overall match of the coarse sequence of frames with the respective coarse sequence of states can be quickly determined by simple accessing the table and accumulating the
