<ABSTRACT>
Mouldings produced from rigid polystyrene foam or polystyrene particle foam are used for insulation purposes. It has been found that rigid polystyrene foam having a density of less than 20 kg/m
<
3
>
 has a higher thermal conductivity than rigid polystyrene foam having a higher density. The invention has the object of providing a moulding made from rigid polystyrene foam which has a density of less than 20 kg/m
<
3
>
 and a favourable thermal conductivity. This object is achieved according to the invention by providing the rigid polystyrene foam with an athermanous material. The consequence of this is that corresponding mouldings having a density of less than 20 kg/m
<
3
>
 have a thermal conductivity which is no greater or not significantly greater than the thermal conductivity of rigid polystyrene foam having a density of about 40 kg/m
<
3
>
 with relatively low thermal conductivity. The invention is particularly suitable for sheet-like mouldings made from polystyrene particle foam for insulation in the construction (building) sector.

Moulding comprising expanded polystyrene foam
and an athermanous material, where the expanded

polystyrene foam has a density of less than 20 kg/m
3
 and
the athermanous material absorbs infrared radiation.
Moulding according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the athermanous material is embedded in the

expanded polystyrene foam.
Moulding according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the proportion of the athermanous material is from

0.5 to 5% by weight of the expanded polystyrene foam.
Moulding according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the athermanous material

is carbon black.
Moulding according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the athermanous material

is graphite.
Moulding according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the athermanous material

is aluminium powder.
Moulding according to any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the athermanous material

is a mixture of carbon black, graphite and/or aluminium
powder.
Process for producing mouldings which comprise
expanded polystyrene foam and infrared-absorbing

athermanous material and serve as insulation, where the
athermanous material is applied to prefoamed

polystyrene beads by external coating or wetting. 
Process for producing mouldings which comprise
expanded polystyrene foam and infrared-absorbing

athermanous material and serve as insulation, where the
athermanous material is embedded as additive in the not

yet foamed granules for forming the expanded
polystyrene foam.
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the athermanous material together with a blowing

agent is embedded in the not yet foamed polystyrene
granules.
