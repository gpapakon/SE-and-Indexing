<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adhesive 
fluorine-containing polymer which can be firmly bonded to 
substrates made of various organic materials or inorganic 
materials, and a laminate prepared by using it. A fluorine-containing polymer is excellent in the 
chemical resistance, weather resistance and surface 
properties and thus is widely used in many fields. One 
of applications of such a fluorine-containing polymer is 
an application as a laminate. For example, an 
application as a surface coating material is known in 
which e.g. a film of a fluorine-containing polymer is 
laminated on the surface of a substrate made of an 
inorganic material or an organic material such as a 
synthetic resin, to cover the substrate. However, a 
fluorine-containing polymer is a material which 
inherently has poor adhesive properties, and in many 
cases, no adequate adhesive strength can be obtained if  
 
e.g. a film of a fluorine-containing polymer is laminated 
directly on a substrate. Even when an adhesive strength 
can be obtained to some extent, such an adhesive strength 
is likely to vary depending upon the type of the material 
of the substrate, whereby the reliability of the adhesion 
has been inadequate in many cases. An adhesive to bond a fluorine-containing polymer is 
known. However, such an adhesive is poor in the chemical 
resistance or water resistance as compared with the 
fluorine-containing polymer and has frequently caused a 
problem for a laminate employing a fluorine-containing 
polymer. Further, in order to use such an adhesive, it 
has been required to use a primer, or to apply surface 
treatment to the fluorine-containing polymer, in many 
cases. Under these circumstances, it is an object of the 
present invention to provide a fluorine-containing 
polymer having excellent adhesive properties. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a laminate employing such an adhesive fluorine-containing 
polymer, such as a laminate having such an 
adhesive fluorine-containing polymer laminated on a 
substrate made of various organic materials or inorganic 
materials, or a laminate in which such an adhesive 
fluorine-containing polymer is used as an adhesive to 
laminate another fluorine-containing polymer on a 
substrate made of various materials.  The present invention provides an adhesive fluorine-containing 
polymer comprising a fluorine-containing 
polymer having hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms of 
its main chain and a grafting compound having a linking 
group capable of
