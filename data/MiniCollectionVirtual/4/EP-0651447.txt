<ABSTRACT>
A resonant tunneling diode (400) made of a silicon quantum well (406) 
with silicon oxide tunneling barriers (404, 408). The tunneling barriers have 

openings (430) of size smaller than the electron wave packet spread to insure 
crystal alignment through the diode without affecting the tunneling barrier 

height.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electronic devices, and, more particularly, to 
resonant tunneling devices and systems. The continual demand for enhanced transistor and integrated circuit 
performance has resulted in improvements in existing devices, such as silicon 
bipolar and CMOS transistors and gallium arsenide MESFETs, and also in the 
introduction of new device types and materials. In particular, scaling down 
device sizes to enhance high frequency performance leads to observable 
quantum mechanical effects such as carrier tunneling through potential 
barriers. This led to development of alternative device structures such as 
resonant tunneling diodes and resonant tunneling hot electron transistors which 
take advantage of such tunneling phenomena. Resonant tunneling diodes are two terminal devices with conduction 
carriers tunneling through potential barriers to yield current-voltage curves with 
portions exhibiting negative differential resistance. Recall that the original 
Esaki diode had interband tunneling (e.g., from conduction band to valence 
band) in a heavily doped PN junction diode. An alternative resonant tunneling 
diode structure relies on resonant tunneling through a quantum well in a single 
band; see Figure 1 which illustrates a AlGaAs/GaAs quantum well. Further, 
Mars et al., Reproducible Growth and Application of AlAs/GaAs Double Barrier 
Resonant Tunneling Diodes, 11 J.Vac.Sci.Tech.B 965 (1993), and Ã–zbay et al, 
110-GHz Monolithic Resonant-Tunneling-Diode Trigger Circuit, 12 IEEE 
Elec.Dev.Lett. 480 (1991), each use two AlAs tunneling barriers imbedded in a  
 
GaAs structure to form a quantum well resonant tunneling diode. The quantum 
well may be 4.5 nm thick with 1.7 nm thick tunneling barriers. Figure 2 
illustrates current-voltage behavior at room temperature. Note that such 
resonant tunneling "diodes" are symmetrical. With the bias shown in Figure 3a, 
a discrete electron level (bottom edge of a subband) in the quantum well aligns 
with the cathode conduction band edge, so electron tunneling readily occurs and 
the current is large. Contrarily, with the bias shown in Figure 3b the cathode 
conduction band aligns between quantum well levels and suppresses tunneling, 
and the current is small. Attempts to fabricate quantum wells in silicon-based semiconductors, 
rather than the III-V semiconductors such as AlGaAs and GaAs, have focussed 
primarily on silicon-germanium alloys. For example, the Topical Conference on 
Silicon-Based Heterostructures II (Chicago 1992) included
