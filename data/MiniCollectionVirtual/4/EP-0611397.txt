<DESCRIPTION>
Disclosed are recombinant baculovirus expressing the gag, gp70, and gp85 genes of
feline leukemia virus, vaccines, and methods of making and using vaccines based on these
expressed products. Also disclosed is a combined mucosal/parenteral inoculation method.The oncomovirus feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a member of the Retroviridae family
of viruses. In cats, FeLV can cause lymphoma, myeloproliferative diseases, leukemia,
immunodeficiency syndrome, aplastic anemia, and neurological disease. The virus is highly
infectious for newborn or young kittens while older cats are resistant to even the most oncogenic
strains of FeLV. Animals can be vaccinated against FeLV. For instance, early attempts to
produce a vaccine for FeLV infection included the administration of live or inactivated FL74
feline lymphoma cells using a variety of adjuvants. However the efficacy of these vaccines has
been disputed and many of these attempts were unsuccessful in protecting cats either against
persistent viraemia or secondary lymphoma and sarcoma development. Soluble tumor cell
antigen vaccines are presently commercially available and other experimental vaccines based on
ISCOMs and subunits have also been reported.The FeLV genome codes for three genes: a gag gene coding for the major structural
components of the virus, an env gene which codes for the envelope glycoprotein, and a pol gene
encoding the polymerase protein. The gag gene is expressed as a 65 kD polyprotein which is
processed into four subunits: a p15 matrix protein, a p12 protein of unknown function, a p27
capsid protein, and a p10 nucleocapsid protein. The pol gene encodes three proteins: the
protease, reverse transcriptase and the integrase. Autoprocessing by the protease portion of the
gene gives rise to all three proteins of the pol region. Additionally, the protease is responsible
for the processing of the gag precursor. The pol gene is expressed as a gag-pol fusion protein.
The envelope gene is expressed as a 85 Kd glycoprotein, gp85, which is further processed to the
disulfide bound, membrane associated 70 kD and 15 kD (p15E) complex found on the surface
of the virion. This same gag-protease region has been inserted into the feline herpes virus
(FHV) genome and shown to produce both the gag gene product and a gag-protease fusion
protein in recombinant FHV infected cells. The protease was also active in processing the gag
(p65) into its four polypeptide components.Baculoviruses are a large group of viruses which are highly virulent to specific insects
but are
