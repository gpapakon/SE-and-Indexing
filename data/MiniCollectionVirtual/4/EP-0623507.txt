<ABSTRACT>
Mechanism for increasing the turning radius of small size boats (11), provided with an outboard motor (2), wherein the steering is 
effected by means of the rotation of said motor (2) and characterized in that it comprises an auxiliary rudder (7) arranged in prolongation 

of the propeller of said motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a system that is designed to 
increase the manoeuvrability of small size boats which are fitted 
with an outboard motor, where the manoeuvre is performed by 
turning this motor. Boats nowadays with an outboard motor, where the manoeuvre is 
made by turning that motor, have manoeuvrability problems when 
the propeller turns at low revolutions, such as when, for example 
mooring manoeuvres or cruising inside marinas or ports where 
there is usually a restricted speed. The origin of these problems is because in motors of this kind, 
it is the propeller which acts as rudder, and it has a lower 
performance when its speed of rotation is reduced. An additional problem which is presented in this kind of motor 
is the restricted lock which can be reached with these motors 
which, for construction reasons, is usually limited to 30 or 35ยบ. The problem of increasing manoeuvrability at low speed has in the 
case of big boats been resolved by adding propellers which are 
fitted with a cross axle to the keel line, at bow and stern, 
within a tunnel performed in the hull. Evidently, the construction of this kind of mechanisms is 
mechanically complicated because additional motors are needed 
which render their cost prohibitive to be used in small boats. The purpose of this invention is to achieve an increase in the 
manoeuvrability of this sort of boat without having to fit  
 
additional drive systems, and it can be applied in all kinds of 
boats which have a motor whose propeller works as rudder. The increase in manoeuvrability 
of boats of this kind is obtained by reducing their locking 
radius, and this can be achieved with the help of an auxiliary 
rudder fitted after the motor propeller, whose locking axle is 
solidary to this and whose operation does not require any 
additional energy supply. Such an arrangement has been disclosed 
in AU-B-527 066. the auxiliary rudder of the present invention is capable of reducing the locking radius, 
and even achieves its rotation on itself, without having to add 
additional controls or drives to the regular ones in this sort 
of boat. A mechanism to increase the locking radius in accordance with the 
present invention offers the following advantages: 
First of all, there is no change in the form of manoeuvring 
the boat, because its form of action consists of increasing 
the effect of its normal locking mechanism. A minimum resistance f'ward is introduced when travelling 
at high speed, because the boat's aerodynamic profile is 
optionally

<CLAIMS>
Mechanism to increase the manoeuvrability of a boat which 
has an outboard motor or semi-outboard which comprises an 

auxiliary rudder (7) which is arranged after the propeller (1) 
of that motor (2) and means to transmit the turning movement to 

that rudder (7) simultaneously with the turning movement of that 
motor (2) in such a manner that the locking angle of the auxiliary 

rudder (7) progresively increases with regard to the locking angle of 
the motor (2), characterized in that it includes: 


a pulley (4) arranged at the rear of this motor (2) which is 
capable of transmitting a turning movement to a first gear (5), 
a second gear (6) which interlocks with the first gear (5) and 
arranged on the locking shaft (8) of that rudder (7); 
a lineal component (9) attached at each end to the boat on 
either side of the turning axle (3) of that boat (2) and which 

passes by that pulley (4) to provide rotational movement to said 
pulley (4). 
Mechanism in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
the union of the ends of this lineal component (9) to the boat 

are elastic means (10) which allow the tension of the lineal 
component (9) to be maintained. 
Mechanism in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
the union of that component to the boat consists of a system of 

pulleys and counter-weights to maintain the tension of that 
lineal component (9). 
Mechanism in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
this lineal component 89) is a cable. 
Mechanism in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
this element of union (9) is a belt.  

 
Mechanism in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
this lineal component (9) is a chain. 
Mechanism in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that 
it includes means to disconnect that rudder (7) to prevent the 

manoeuvrability of the boat from being affected at a given speed. 
Mechanism in accordance with claim 7, characterized in that 
these means to disconnect allow these gears (5,6) to operate only 

from a pre-determined speed of the boat. 
Mechanism in accordance with claim 7, characterized in that 
these means for disconnecting make it possible for this lineal 

component (9) to compel the turning of that pulley (4) only from 
a given locking angle of that motor (2). 
Mechanism in accordance with claim 7, characterized in that 
these means of disconnecting provoke the ungearing between gears 

(5) and (6) from a pre-established speed of the boat by effect 
of greater water pressure. 
Mechanism in accordance with claim 7, characterized in that 
those means for disconnecting allow the ungearing between gears 

(5) and (6). 
Mechanism in accordance with any of the precedent claims, 
characterized in that it includes a protector cover of pulleys 

and gears.
