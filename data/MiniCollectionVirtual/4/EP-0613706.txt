<ABSTRACT>
Amusement device in which persons sitting on seats (13) observe the 
environment in varying positions. The amusement device comprises a 

column (6) 
which is suspended from at least one supporting leg (1) in such a way 

that it 
can rotate about a horizontal or slanting first shaft (9), a 

counterweight (2) 
disposed at one end of the column (6), and a passenger gondola (5) 

disposed at 
the other end of the column (6), and means (15) for rotating the column 

(6) about the 
horizontal or slanting first shaft (9). The passenger gondola (5) is 

suspended 
between the teeth (8) of a fork (7) disposed at the other end of the 

column (6). The 
gondola (5) in this case can rotate about a second shaft (10) extending 

between 
the teeth (8). The fork (7) can rotate about a third shaft (11) 

positioned essentially 
at right angles to the column (6) and/or about the longitudinal axis 

of the 
column (6). These rotations are preferably all lockable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an amusement device and method 
of operating this device according to the preamble of claims 1 and 9, 
respectively. Such an amusement device is disclosed in DE-A-3,234,325 and DE-A-3,234,341. 
In this amusement device the rotation axis of the gondola 
extends perpendicular to the row of passenger seats. In case the drive 
means for rotating the gondola with respect to the arms fail, this can 
lead to dangerous situations, in which the gondola can hit the ground. A further device is known from Dutch Patent Application 
86.00190. This amusement device comprises two columns which can rotate 
about a horizontal shaft, and each of which is suspended from a supporting 
leg. A counterweight is fixed to one end of each column, while a passenger 
gondola, extending between the two ends, is disposed at the other 
end of each column. In order to rotate such a gondola, at the same time 
both columns must be driven separately, so that said columns are made to 
rotate about a horizontal shaft, and the gondola is thus made to describe 
a circle lying in a vertical plane. These drives must run in synchronism, 
in order to ensure a true circular path of the gondola. Special movement 
effects are produced by making the two motors run out of synchronism from 
time to time, with the result that a phase difference occurs in the rotation 
of the two columns. In order to keep the movement of the gondola 
fully under control, it is necessary for the drives of the two columns to 
be fully synchronizable, in such a way that they can rotate at the same 
speed of rotation at all times. This synchronization is difficult, inter 
alia because in practice it is not known beforehand how the gondola will 
be loaded and how said load will be distributed. If one of the drives for 
the columns fails, highly dangerous situations can occur. US-A-2,562,324 discloses an amusement apparatus with two swinging 
arms each extending between a horizontal rotating axis and a U-shaped 
hanger with a carrier for one passenger. This apparatus does not have a 
counterweight, so that it must be swung to and fro in a gradually increasing 
arc before the passenger carrier can make a full rotation around 
the horizontal rotating axis of the swing arm. The swinging to and fro 
results in great dynamic and harmful loads on the apparatus.  
 The object of the present invention is to provide an amusement 
device and method of operating such device by which spectacular effects 
can be achieved. This object is achieved according
