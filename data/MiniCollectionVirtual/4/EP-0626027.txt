<ABSTRACT>
The prefabricated wall panel (16) with a curable, pourable compound (22) is used to make light walls or external cladding. A core (10) of a light heat and/or sound-damping material is completely enclosed by the curable compound (22). For improved sound-damping, a groove (30, 32) is preferably formed approximately along the centre of the narrow sides which separates the curable compound (22) and form two bearing shells (22a, 22b). A device for producing wall panels (16) of rectangular aspect comprises a section frame forming their narrow sides with short legs (34, 36) pivoted on  a long leg (34 or 36) and a removable second long leg (36 or 34). The wall panel provides considerable advantages in weight, heat and/or sound-damping and reduced risk of cracking.
