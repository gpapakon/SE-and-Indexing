<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer dyesheet typically comprises an elongated substrate supporting print-size portions of first, second and third colour dyecoats arranged in a repeated sequence, generally yellow, magenta and cyan, ready to be transferred to a receiver in turn. In addition to their characteristic absorptions, both the magenta and cyan colours may have some absorptions in the blue (like yellow), and the cyan also in the green (like magenta). These additional absorptions can become a problem when the colours are mixed in the receiver. A further complication arises when an initially applied colour is partially removed by clawback during subsequent overprinting. In the present dyesheet, those unwanted absorptions are balanced against the loss through clawback of a previously transferred colour.

<DESCRIPTION>
THERMAL TRANSFER PRINTING DYESHEETThe invention relates to dyesheets for thermal transfer printing, and especially to dyesheets capable of providing prints with good colour rendition.Thermal transfer printing is a generic term for processes in which one or more thermally transferable dyes are caused to transfer from a dyesheet to a receiver in response to thermal stimuli. Using a dyesheet comprising a thin substrate supporting a dyecoat containing one or more dyes uniformly spread over an entire printing area of the dyesheet, printing can be effected by heating selected discrete areas of the dyesheet while the dyecoat is pressed against a dye-receptive surface of a receiver sheet, thereby causing dye to transfer to corresponding areas of the receiver. The shape of the pattern transferred is determined by the number and locations of the discrete areas which are subjected to heating. Full colour prints can be produced by printing with different coloured dyecoats sequentially in like manner, and the different coloured dyecoats are usually provided as discrete uniform print-size areas in a repeated sequence along the same dyesheet.High resolution photograph-like prints can be produced by thermal transfer printing using appropriate printing equipment, such as a programmable thermal print head or laser printer, controlled by electronic signals derived from a video, computer, electronic still camera, or similar signal generating apparatus. A typical thermal print head has a row of tiny selectively energizable heaters, spaced to print six or more pixels per millimetre, often with two heaters per pixel. Laser printers require absorbers to convert the laser radiation to heat, usually in or under the 

dyecoat, and similarly produce the print by transferring dyes to the receiver pixel by pixel.Like colour printing of various other technologies, thermal transfer printing is based on a subtractive three colour system, using yellow, magenta and cyan colours (not precluding the addition of black) . In addition to their characteristic absorptions in the green, magenta dyes typically provide substantial blue absorption, and cyan dyes typically have substantial absorption of green wavelengths in addition to their characteristic absorption of red light. Yellow dyes absorb in the blue to provide their characteristic colour, and the additional absorptions at shorter wavelengths are generally outside the visible region, so do not contribute to the colour perceived.Although such dyes may have good colour on their own, when
