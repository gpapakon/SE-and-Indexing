<ABSTRACT>
1
º
 
 Both load cells are fixed together and fixed to the stand 
(F)
2
º
 The moving part of the load cells are free to move, not having contact 
between them or with the stand 
(F)
 
3
 
º
 
 The rod 
(C)
 is fixed to the load cell 
(A)
, the tube 
(D)
 is fixed to the 
load cell 
(B),
 the rod and the tube do not touch.

4
º
 The load cell 
(A)
 funtions inverted to load cell 
(B).
5
º
 The load cells as they are in the drawing, we adjust the cell outputs to 
be zero.


6
º
 The rod 
(C)
 is above the level of the bottom of tube 
(D).
7
º
 A sample 
(E)
 moving upward pushing tube 
(D)
 will generate a signal in load 
cell 
(B),
 further on, sample 
(E),
 will touch rod 
(C)
 generating a signal on 
load cell 
(A).
 At this moment we measure both signals, the difference in 
amplitude of both signals, represent a distance (example 200 microns), if we 

continue to push sample 
(E)
 this difference in signal between the load cells, 
will be constant to the top range of the load cells. 
DEPTH MEASUREMENT
8
º
 Sample 
(E)
 with a hole centered, superior in diameter to rod 
(C)
 and 
inferior in diameter to tube 
(D),
 when moving sample 
(E)
 upward the rod 
penetrates the hole in sample 
(E),
 the difference in amplitude of signals from 
both load cells can not be equal (example 200 microns) to the measurement of 

point 
7
º
.
 When sample 
(E)
 touches both tube 
(D)
 and rod 
(C)
 we take both load 
cells signal measurement. We subtract the difference in amplitude of signals 

in point 
7
º
 to the difference in amplitude of signals in point 
8
º
the result 
is the hole depth.
HARDNESS MEASUREMENT
9
º
 We install a Vickers Knoop or Rockwell penetrator on the point of rod 
(C),
 
it does not touch tube 
(D).
 We push sample 
(E)
 upward until it touches lightly 
the penetrator on rod 
(C)
 we now take signal measurement of both load cells, 
we obtain the difference between both signals (readin
g 
1
).
 

We keep pushing sample 
(E)
 until we reach the load wanted, we now take signal 
measurement of both load cells, we obtain the difference between both signals 

(reading 
2
).
 

We substract (reading 
1
) from (reading 
2
) and the result is the distance the 
penetrator has penetrated sample 
(E).

 
Hardness is now calculated as a function of depth and load applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention I am patenting uses two load cells to measure 
distances with precision of 0.04 microns. Load cells have a special resistance attched to them, this 
resistance varies when the dimensions of the metal contract or 
expand, this variation in resistance is converted to voltage, 
amplified, converted to digital and then to weight. Since we know the distance a particular load cell deflects 
for a known weight, 0.5 mm distance from zero grams to 2.000 
grams in one case, we can find that each gram deflects the load 
cell 0.25 microns per gram. This property of measuring distances as a function of load 
applied plus the capability to measure distances compairing the 
signals (voltage) of two equal load cells allows us, to perform 
very precise distance measurements.  The invention I am patenting increases the measuring 
techniques to : 
Flatness measurement Roundness measurement Roughness measurement Layer thickness measurement Dimensional measurement Hardness measurement 1º Both load cells are fixed together and fixed to the stand (F)2º The moving part of the load cells are free to move, not having contact between them or with the stand (F)3º The rod (C) is fixed to the load cell (A), the tube (D) is fixed to the load cell (B), the rod and the tube do not touch. 4º The load cell (A) funtions inverted to load cell (B). 5º The load cells as they are in the drawing, we adjust the cell outputs to be zero. 6º The rod (C) is above the level of the bottom of tube (D). 7º A sample (E) moving upward pushing tube (D) will generate a signal in load cell (B), further on, sample (E), will touch 
rod (C) generating a signal on load cell (A). At this moment we measure both signals, the difference in amplitude of both

(E) upward the rod penetrates the hole in sample (E), the difference in amplitude of signals from both load cells can not 
be equal (example 200 microns) to the measurement of point 7º. When sample (E) touches both tube (D) and rod (C) we take both 
load cells signal measurement. We subtract the difference in amplitude of signals in point 7º to the difference in amplitude 
of signals In point 8ºthe result is the hole depth.9º We install a Vickers Knoop or Rockwell penetrator on the
