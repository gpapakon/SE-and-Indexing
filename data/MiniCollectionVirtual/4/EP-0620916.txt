<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for the determination of a chemical or biochemical species comprises a resonant optical sensor (1-4) disposed in a light path between a source (5) of monochromatic light and a detector (12) adapted to monitor some characteristic of the light. A light-scattering element (7) is disposed in the light path between the source (5) and the sensor (1-4). The light-scattering element may be a speckle plate or a diffusion screen, and is preferably formed on the input side of the sensor, which may be a disposable unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title : Analytical Device with Light ScatteringThis invention relates to sensors, especially those termed biosensors, ie devices for the analysis of biologically active species such as antigens and antibodies in samples of biological origin. In particular, the invention relates to biosensors based on resonant optical phenomena, eg surface plasmon resonance or resonant attenuated or frustrated total internal reflection.Many devices for the automatic determination of biochemical analytes in solution have been proposed in recent years. Typically, such devices (biosensors) include a sensitised coating layer which is located in the evanescent region of a resonant field. Detection of the analyte typically utilizes optical techniques such as, for example, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and is based on changes in the thickness and/or refractive index of the coating layer resulting from interaction of that layer with the analyte. This causes a change, eg in the angular position of the resonance.Other optical biosensors include a waveguide in which a beam of light is propagated. The optical characteristics of the device are influenced by changes occurring at the surface of the waveguide. One form of optical biosensor is based on frustrated total reflection. The principles of frustrated total reflection (FTR) are well-known; the technique is described, for example, by Bosaσchi and Oehrle [Applied Optics (1982), 21, 2167-2173]. An FTR device for use in immunoassay is disclosed in European Patent Application No 2205236A and comprises a cavity layer bounded on one side by the sample under investigation and on the other side by a spacer layer which in turn is mounted on a substrate. The substrate-spacer layer interface is irradiated with monochromatic radiation such that total reflection occurs, the associated evanescent field penetrating through the spacer layer. If the thickness of the spacer layer is correct and the incident parallel wave 

 vector matches one of the resonant mode propagation constants, the total reflection is frustrated and radiation is coupled into the cavity layer. The cavity layer must be composed of material which has a higher refractive index than the spacer layer and which is transparent at the wavelength of the incident radiation.In devices of this kind, the position of resonance may be monitored by scanning the angle at which monochromatic light is incident on the sensor. The scanning of angle may be performed either sequentially or simultaneously ie by varying the angle of incidence of
