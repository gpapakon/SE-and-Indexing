<ABSTRACT>
For non-invasively monitoring the concentration of a substance in blood, use is made of a pickup unit, with a cavity (3) through which a liquid is passed. The cavity is held against the skin and the concentration of the substance which has penetrated into the passing liquid is measured. The method according to the invention makes it possible to monitor non-invasively and continuously the extent to which various low-molecular, water-soluble substances are present in the body of a human or an animal. Further described is an instrument for carrying out the method according to the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to the preamble
of claim 1 and to
an instrument according to the preamble of claim 10.Such a method
and such an instrument are disclosed in US-A-5 050 604.
In Japanese patent application
61-25541 a method intended for measuring the
glucose concentration in the blood, in particular in patients
with diabetes is disclosed.It is observed that hereinafter the term "patient" is
understood to mean a human or an animal in general, whether
healthy or ill.According to this known method, a glucose oxidase enzyme
is immobilized directly behind a cellulose membrane which has
a good permeability to water and substances dissolved therein.
Behind that, a limiting membrane is provided, which arrests
reduced substances but allows water, hydrogen peroxide and
salts to pass therethrough. Behind this membrane, hydrogen
peroxide is detected with a platinum electrode.The glucose oxidase enzyme produces hydrogen peroxide and
an acid, depending on the amount of glucose which has passed
through the cellulose membrane. The acid is arrested by the
limiting membrane, but the hydrogen peroxide is allowed to
pass. Through the electrode flows an electrical current which
is dependent on the amount of hydrogen peroxide which has
entered the fluid. Thus, on the basis of the current
intensity, the amount of glucose which has passed through the
cellulose membrane can be determined. The amount of glucose
which has passed through the cellulose membrane, in turn, is
dependent on the glucose concentration in the blood. Thus,
this concentration can be monitored continuously and without
invasive examination. A drawback of this known method is that it is only
suitable for monitoring the
glucose concentration.In other known methods,
such as the method disclosed in US-A-5 050 604 mentioned above,
where, on the basis of the
substance penetrating through the skin, the extent to which
that substance is present in the body is measured
transcutaneously, that substance is accumulated over a given
period. An interruption of the accumulation or an unreliable
period within the time period of the accumulation is then
disastrous for the reliability of the results obtained after
that interruption or unreliable period.The object of the invention is to provide a method which
is also suitable for non-invasively monitoring the
concentration of other low-molecular, water-soluble
substances.According to the present invention, this object is
realized by carrying out a method of the type described in the
opening paragraph in
