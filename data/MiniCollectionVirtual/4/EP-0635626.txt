<ABSTRACT>
Exhaust gas converter with at least one monolith (2) composed of a plurality of individual ceramic elements (1), the individual elements (1) being covered on their contact surfaces with expanded material (4, 5, 20) and the expanded matting material (4, 5, 20), in operation of the converter, bracing the individual elements (1) to form a monolithic block.

<CLAIMS>
An exhaust gas converter with at least one monolithic block 
(2) composed of several individual elements (1) which are arranged side by side,
 
   characterized in that 


the individual elements (1) are at least partly covered on 
their contact surfaces by an expanding mat material (4, 5, 

20) and 
that the expanding 
mat material (4, 5, 20) braces the individual elements (1) 

into a monolithic block (2) within the converter housing. 
An exhaust gas converter according to claim 1,
 
   characterized in that
 
the outer circumferential surface of the monolithic block (2) is 

wrapped round by an integral continuous expanding mat (5, 20) 
which holds the individual elements (1) together. 
An exhaust gas converter according to claim 2,
 
   characterized in that
 
the adjoining contact surfaces of the individual elements (1) 

are covered by cut expanding mat portions (4). 
An exhaust gas converter according to claim 1 or 2,
 
   characterized in that
 
the cylindrical surface of the individual elements (1) is in 

each case peripherally wrapped by a continuous elemental expanding 
mat (20). 
An exhaust gas converter according to one of claims 1 to 4,
 
   characterized in that
 
the areal weight of the expanding mat material preferably superposed 

in several layers for forming the expanding mat (4, 5, 20) 
is greater than, or equal to 1050 g/m
2
. 
An exhaust gas converter in particular according to one of 
claims 1 to 5,
 
   characterized by
 
protective sections (10, 26) on the end faces 


of the expanding mat (5) and/or 
of the cut portions (4) of the expanding mat and/or 
of the elemental expanding mat (20). 
An exhaust gas converter according to claim 6,
 
   characterized in that 


the protective sections are T-shaped sections (10) and 
that the T-shaped sections (10) are held with their T-base 
(11) in the planes of separation (3) formed between the 

contact surfaces of two individual elements (1) of the 
adjoining cut portions (4) of the expanding mat or of the 

elemental expanding mats (20). 
An exhaust gas converter according to claim 7,
 
   characterized in that
 
the profiled sections (10) are made of sheet metal with a thickness 

of preferably at least 0.2 mm. 
An exhaust gas converter according to claim 7 or 8,
 
   characterized in that
 
the clamping depth (14) of the T-base (11) is greater than, or 

equal to 5 mm. 
An exhaust gas converter according to one of claims 7 to 9,
 
   characterized in that
 
the overall width of the two T-arms (12), projecting from one 

end of the T-base (11) approximately at right angles, exceeds 
the gap width of the separation plane (3) by at least 1 mm. 
An exhaust gas converter according to one of claims 7 to 
10,
 
   characterized in that
 
the T-shaped profiled section (10) is composed of two rectangular 

angle sections (15) applied to each other in a mirror-inverted 
mode. 
An exhaust gas converter according to claim 11,
 
   characterized in that
 
the abutting arms of the angle sections (15) are rigidly connected 

to each other. 
An exhaust gas converter according to one of claims 1 to 6,
 
   characterized by
 
a cover frame (25), preferably drawn from sheet steel, adapted 

in the zone of the end face of the monolithic block (2) to the 
continuous line formed by the planes of separation, in such a 

way 

that the profiled bars (26) forming the frame (25) act as 
protective sections and appropriately cover the planes of 

separation (3) and 
that the profiled bars (26) leave openings (27) between 
them for the passing of the exhaust flow. 
An exhaust gas converter according to claim 13,
 
   characterized in that
 
the profiled bars (26) are shaped for laterally covering the 

planes of separation (3).
