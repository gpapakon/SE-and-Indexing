<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite fiber, and microfiber
made therefrom, a process for the manufacture of the composite
fiber as well as a process for the production of the microfiber.
In particular it relates to a composite fiber, comprising a water
insoluble and a water dissipatable polymer.Composite fibers and microfibers made therefrom as well as
different processes for their manufacture are well known in the
art.The composite fibers are manufactured in general by combining at
least two incompatible fiber-forming polymers via extrusion
followed by optionally dissolving one of the polymers from the
resultant fiber to form microfibers.U.S. Pat. No. 3,700,545 discloses a multi-segmented polyester or
polyamide fiber having at least 10 fine segments with cross
sectional shapes and areas irregular and uneven to each other.The spun fibers are treated with an alkali or an acid to decompose
and at least a part of the polyester or polyamide is removed.Described is a complex spinnerette for the manufacture of such
fibers.U.S. Pat. No. 3,382,305 discloses a process for the formation of
microfibers having an average diameter of 0.01 to 3 micron by 
blending two incompatible polymers and extruding the resultant
mixture into filaments and further dissolving one of the polymers
from the filament. The disadvantage if this process is that the
cross section of these filaments is very irregular and uneven and
the islands, which form the microfibers after the hydrolysis, are
discontinuous, which means that they are not continuous over the
length of the composite fibers.U.S. Pat. No. 5,120,598 describes ultra-fine polymeric fibers for
cleaning up oil spills. The fibers were produced by mixing an
polyolefin with poly (vinyl alcohol) and extruding the mixture
through a die followed by further orientation. The poly (vinyl
alcohol) is extracted with water to yield ultra-fine polymeric
fibers. A disadvantage of this process is the limitation of the
polymers to the polyolefin family because of their relative low
melting point. At higher temperatures which are necessary for the
extrusion of polyamides or polyesters, the poly (vinyl alcohol)
decomposes.EP-A-0,498,672 discloses microfiber generating fibers of island-in-the-sea
type obtained by melt extrusion of a mixture of two
polymers, whereby the sea polymer is soluble in a solvent and releases
the insoluble island fiber of a fineness of 0.01 denier or
less. Described is polyvinyl alcohol as the sea polymer, which
limits the application to the polyolefin polymer
