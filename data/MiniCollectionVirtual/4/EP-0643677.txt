washing installation, in particular a car washing 

installation, wherein the wash water is used in at 
least one washing process for cleaning a motor 

vehicle or the like and after a washing process is 
reused at least in part, whereby at least part of the 

evacuated wash water is collected and supplied as raw 
water to a filtering installation or similar 

treatment apparatus having at least one semi-permeable 
membrane, under the driving force of a 

pressure difference part of the supplied raw water 
going through the membrane as pure water which is 

supplied as wash water to at least one ulterior 
washing process,

 after each 
washing process the wash water is reused in an 

essentially closed water circuit for successive 
washing processes, that the direction of flow of the 

raw water flowing by the semi-permeable membrane (11) 
in the form of a wound module is reversed or changed 

at intervals of time, and that the remaining raw 
water flowing by the membrane (11) leaves the raw 

water zone (12) of the membrane (11) as concentrate 
and is supplied again to a semi-permeable membrane 

(11) and/or to a successive washing process with 
preferably lesser demands on the quality of the 

water. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in

A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that an increase in the static water 

pressure on the pure water side (13) of the membrane

reduction or interruption of the outflow of pure 
water at the membrane (11), and that after a static 

pressure increase on the pure water side (13), 
particularly after a balancing of the static water 

pressure on both sides of the membrane (11), the 
static water pressure prevailing on the raw water 

side (12) of the treatment apparatus (9) is 
periodically lowered momentarily, preferably 

abruptly, relative to the static water pressure 
prevailing on the pure water side (13). 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in th
at the flow rate of the raw water

the static water pressure prevailing on the raw water 
side (12). 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the outflow of raw water and 

the outflow of pure water at the membrane (11) is

and that before the outflow of pure water is opened 
or increased the outflow of raw water at the membrane 

(11) is opened or increased preferably in a reversed  
 

direction of flow compared to the direction of flow 
of the raw water flowing by the membrane (11) prior 

to the reduction or interruption. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the time intervals provided for 

reversing the direction of flow and/or for altering 
the water pressure at the membrane (11) and/or the 

level of change in water pressure at the membrane 
(11) are selected in dependence on the degree of 

pollution of the wash water collected and supplied as 
raw water to the treatment apparatus (9). 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that pure water or a less saliferous 

water compared to the formerly used raw water is 
temporarily supplied as raw water or feed water to 

the treatment apparatus (9), preferably for 
intermittent passage in a reverse direction of flow, 

particularly during a short-term lowering of the 
static water pressure on the raw water side (12) 

compared to the static water pressure prevailing on 
the pure water side (13). 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that chemical deposit aids, 

adsorbing agents and/or absorbing agents are supplied 
to the raw water before the membrane (11) in the 

direction of flow. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the process for producing pure 

water is a reverse osmosis provess.  
 
A washing installation, particularly a car washing 
installation, with at least one spray head or similar 

wash water outlet which is provided for applying the 
wash water to a motor vehicle or similar object to be 

cleaned, whereby the washing installation has an 
arrangement for collecting the wash water after each 

washing process, which collecting arrangement is 
connected to a water treatment apparatus for treating 

at least part of the collected water and the filtrate 
or pure water outlet (10) of said treatment apparatus 

is connected to at least one wash water outlet of the 
washing installation, whereby the treatment apparatus

separates a raw water zone of the treatment apparatus 

from a pure water zone, characterized in that the 
semi-permeable membrane (11) takes the form of a

flowing by the membrane (11) of the treatment 

apparatus (9) on the raw water side (12) is
