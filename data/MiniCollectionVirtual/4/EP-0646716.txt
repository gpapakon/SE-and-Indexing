<ABSTRACT>
The jet pipe (nozzle) comprises fixed parallel side panels (14a, 14b) oriented longitudinally and the rear part of which ends in the shape of a point (15a, 15b), fixed main panels (11a, 11b) and a central body (20) defining first and second ducts for the outflow of hot gases coming from a combustion chamber. First and second throats are formed between the central body (20) and the fixed main panels (11a, 11b). The central body (20) has, downstream of the first and second throats, a convergent part ending near the points (15a, 15b) and the main panels (11a, 11b) also each have rear parts which converge towards the central body (20) and are interrupted by ridges (13a, 13b) constituting first and second focal points situated opposite the convergent part of the central body (20) and ahead of the points (15a, 15b). The gases burnt in the combustion chamber and flowing out through the first and second outflow ducts are subjected to a pressure reduction and to deflection by the central body downstream of the ridges (13a, 13b). The jet pipe (nozzle) further comprises a member forming a flap (30) mounted ahead of the central body (20) so that it can pivot about an axis perpendicular to the fixed side panels (14a, 14b), thus causing the passage cross-sections of the outflow ducts upstream of the first and second throat to vary in opposite directions such that the mass flow rates of the outflows from the two outflow ducts situated on either side of the central body (20) can selectively be altered in opposite directions in order to create different lift components.

Vectorable-thrust bidimensional planar symmetric
expansion/deflection nozzle comprising a first and a

second stationary parallel lateral panel (14a, 14b)
directed longitudinally and the rear part of which ends

in the shape of a point (15a, 15b), a first and a second
stationary main panel (11a, 11b) and a central body (20;

120) which together with each of the first and second
stationary main panels (11a, 11b) defines first and

second flow ducts (41, 42) for hot gases coming from a
combustion chamber (50), a first and a second throat (22;

122) being formed between the central body (20; 120) and
the first and second stationary main panels (11a, 11b),

the central body (20; 120) having, downstream of the
first and second throats (22; 122), a convergent part

ending near the said points (15a, 15b) of the first and
second lateral panels (14a, 14b), and the first and

second main panels (11a, 11b) also each having, downstream
of the first and second throats (22; 122), rear

parts which converge towards the central body (20; 120)
and are interrupted by edges (13a, 13b) constituting a

first and a second centre of thrust (F

facing the convergent part of the central body (20; 120)

and upstream of the said points (15a, 15b) of the first

the combustion chamber (50) and flowing through the first

centres of thrust (F

in that it further comprises a member forming a flap (30;

130) mounted upstream of the central body (20; 120) in
such a way that it can pivot about an axis perpendicular

to the said first and second stationary lateral panels
(14a, 14b), thus causing the passage cross-sections of

the first and second flow ducts (41, 42) upstream of the
first and second throats (22; 122) to vary in opposite

directions in such a way that the mass flow rates through
the two flow ducts (41, 42) on either side of the central
