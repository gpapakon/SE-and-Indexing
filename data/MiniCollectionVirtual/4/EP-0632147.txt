<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polyolefin fibers
suitable for the production of nonwoven fabrics by spun-bonding
process, having improved strength and softness characteristics.
The present invention also relates to a process for the
production of said fibers, a process to produce nonwoven
fabrics by spun-bonding using said fibers, and the nonwoven
fabrics obtained by said process.The definition of "fibers" includes also products similar
to fibers, such as fibrils.Nonwoven fabrics are widely used in various applications.
They are used, for example, in the preparation of articles to
be utilized in the agricultural field, and for domestic and
industrial "throwaway" articles. For some specific uses said
fabrics must possess good softness characteristics (which
depend on the flexibility index of the fiber), strength (which
depends on the thermowelding strength of the fiber) and
resistance to yellowing. These characteristics are
particularly important in the health and medical fields.Polyolefin fibers which can be used for the preparation
of nonwoven fibers possessing good aging and yellowing
resistance are already known in the art. For example, fibers
with the above mentioned properties are described in published
European patent application EP-A-391438, in the name of the
Applicant. Said patent application describes some combinations
of stabilizers which can render the fibers particularly 
resistant to yellowing and aging.Published European patent application EP-A-598 224 in the name
of the Applicant describes nonwoven fabrics which have, among
other things, good softness and strength properties (in the
examples the maximum thermowelding strength of the fibers
constituting the fabrics is slightly higher than 3 N).Now some polyolefin fibers have been found which possess
a high flexibility index and thermowelding strength, besides
presenting good yellowing and aging resistance. These
properties allow one to obtain nonwoven fabrics which offer
good softness and strength.One embodiment of the present invention is a process for
the preparation of nonwoven fabrics which comprise said fibers
and present both softness and strength properties.Another embodiment of the present invention is a process
used to prepare said fibers.Yet another embodiment of the present invention relates
to the nonwoven fabrics obtained with said process.Accordingly the present invention provides a fiber for
nonwoven fabrics having a thermowelding strength at 150°C
or measured according to ASTM 1682 greater
than 5 N and a flexibility
