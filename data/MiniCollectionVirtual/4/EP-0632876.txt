<ABSTRACT>
A ventilation system for a multi-storey building (1), which system comprises a ventilation apparatus (4) mounted on a roof and provided with fans (5) for generating an inlet air flow (B) and a distributing channel for supplying the inlet air flow to various intermediate levels (2) of the building. To avoid a separate distributing channel and to spare building space, a service shaft (3) of the building serves as an inlet air flow channel, which shaft forms a flow path for the inlet air flow directed from the fans (5) downwards, whereby the service shaft has deflecting means (11) for passing a part (D) of the air flow to each intermediate level of the building.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a ventilation system 
for a multi-storey building, which system comprises 
an apparatus mounted on the roof of the 
building with fans for generating an inlet air flow 
and a distributing channel for supplying the inlet 
air flow to various intermediate levels of the 
building. In high buildings, in which indoor air is 
warmer than outdoor air, a pressure difference arises 
between the upper and lower part of the building. 
Since buildings are not airtight, air leaks through 
the constructions from the upper part of the building 
outwards and from the lower part inwards. Inside the 
building the air flows from below upwards. Because of leaks, the lower part of the building 
is cold and draught often appears therein. In the 
upper part it is easily hot and if the humidity of 
the indoor air is clearly higher than the humidity of 
the outdoor air, leaking air may condense to water in 
the constructions. Impurities are spread by the internal 
air flows of the building. These drawbacks can be prevented by constructing 
the intermediate levels as airtight as possible 
in the building. In residential and office buildings, 
for instance, the building has thus been successfully 
divided into parts independent of each other, within 
which the effects of the pressure difference can be 
eliminated by conventional air-conditioning techniques 
thanks to the slightness of the pressure difference. In industrial buildings again, in which there 
are many big passages for production equipment, manholes  
 
and service shafts etc. through the levels, it 
would be extremely expensive and difficult, if not 
directly impossible, to build airtight levels. If there are no intermediate levels in the 
building, temperature differences between the upper 
and lower part of the building can be equalized by 
means of strong air jets, which extend from the vicinity 
of the roof nearly to the plane of the floor, 
bring along air from the upper part of the building 
and mix it effectively. Such a system is known e.g. 
from Finnish Patent no. 56 714. Such a system cannot be used in multi-storey 
buildings, even though the intermediate levels were 
air permeable, such -as plane grates, because areas 
with strong air jets are not suited for working 
places. If there are only a few intermediate levels, 
pressure and temperature differences have been equalized 
by means of axial-flow fans mounted on the levels, 
which fans blow air from an upper level downwards. 
Still, they take up valuable floor space,

<CLAIMS>
A multi-storey building ventilation system comprising 

an apparatus (4) mounted on the roof of the building 
(1) with fans (5) for generating an inlet air flow 

(B) and 
a distributing channel for supplying the inlet air 
flow to various intermediate levels (2) of the 

building, 
characterized in that
an existing service shaft (3) of the building (1) or 
a similar space extending vertically through the 

building and opening to the intermediate levels (2) 
serves as an inlet air flow channel, forming a flow 

path directed from the fans (5) downwards for the 
inlet air flow (B) and for surrounding air induced 

from within the upper intermediate levels (2) of the 
building by said inlet air flow, and 
deflecting means (11; 13) are provided at 
intermediate levels (2) at an edge of the service 

shaft (3) for passing a part (D; E) of the inlet air 
flow (B) to each intermediate level of the 

building. 
A system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
service shaft (3) is located in a corner of the building 

(1). 
A system according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 
the ventilation apparatus (4) comprises at least two 

axial-flow fans (5) mounted adjacent to each other, which 
generate at least two parallel turbulent flows (B') 

braking each other and forming the inlet air flow (B) 
directed downwards.  

 
A system according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 
additional directing means (10) for the inlet air flow (B) 

are mounted after the fans (5) to direct the inlet air 
flow in the direction of the service shaft (3). 
A system according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 an 
additional air directing unit comprising fans (5) and a 

directing device (10) is mounted at least at one 
intermediate level (2) in the service shaft (3) to direct 

the inlet air flow (B) in the direction of the service 
shaft (3). 
A system according to anyone of claims 1 to 5,

by deflecting plates (12) mounted at desired intermediate 

levels (2) in the service shaft (3) and adjustable between 
a vertical position and a horizontal position. 
A system according to anyone of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that
 the deflecting means (13) are formed 
by distributing nozzles (13) parallel with the 

intermediate levels (2) and mounted at desired

(B) and blow it over the intermediate level. 
A system according to anyone of the foregoing claims,

service shaft (3) after the fans (5), which part forms a 

number of adjacent flow channels (9) separated by

A system according to claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the
