<ABSTRACT>
A method for stabilizing a subterranean formation which includes introducing a stabilizing composition into a subterranean formation, for example, by pumping into and through cracks and crevices in the formation and allowing the stabilizing compositions to cure thereby stabilizing the formation. The stabilizing composition includes a non-shrink synthetic resin, a catalyst and various additives and fillers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This disclosure relates to stabilizing compositions 
which are pumpable into cracks and crevices in subterranean 
formations and methods for stabilizing subterranean formations 
to prevent roof-fall, flooding and the like. In mining, especially for coal deposits or the like, 
normally one or more access tunnels or entries are cut into 
the seam or deposit to be mined. In one commonly used method, 
called the longwall method, the product is cut with a shearer 
or plow from a wall of the mine and removed by a conveyor or 
other means until the plow has been moved the desired distance 
into the deposit. As the cavity from where the mined product 
has been removed becomes large, the roof begins to crumble and 
fall into the mine. Thus, each time the plow removes portions 
of the wall, the roof supports and the conveyor or other 
removal means are moved towards the new wall or face, and the 
roof in the direction away from the plow progression crumbles 
into the mine. See, e.g., the description of longwall mining 
by Janssen in U.S. Patent No. 3,892,442.  
 A number of methods have been used to prevent the 
roof of subterranean formations from falling. Typically, 
either timbers frames or rock-bolts are used to create a 
supporting structure that prevents the roof of the mine in 
direct contact with the supporting structure from falling. In 
timber framing operations, timbers are used to build a frame 
around the periphery of the mine such that a supporting 
structure is formed. In rock-bolting operations, a hole is 
drilled into a subterranean formation wherein a self-setting 
composition is used to secure an anchor bolt. Typically, such 
self-setting compositions are provided in a cartridge which 
comprises a resin and a catalyst. For example, Plaisted in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,260,699, discloses a polyester adhesive 
system and a method of using the system in a cartridge 
containing a resin and a catalyst. However, the above methods for supporting 
subterranean formations are not always acceptable or easily 
performed. Thus, stabilizing compositions, which are pumped 
into cracks and crevices in the underground formation, are 
often utilized to stabilize the formation. Various 
compositions have been used to stabilize and strengthen the 
roof and walls of the formation. Many stabilizing systems 
have been proposed ranging from relatively simple cement based 
systems to complex, relatively costly gel-based systems  
 
containing water-soluble acrylamide copolymers and various 
phenol formaldehyde resins.
