<ABSTRACT>
Herbicidal compositions in which the pesticidal component is suspended in fine-grained form in a flowable, oil-containing liquid phase containing at least one component selected from the group of beet herbicides consisting of phenmedipham, ethofumesate and metamitron, so that the total quantity of herbicide constitutes 1 to 50 % by weight, calculated on the basis of the weight of the total composition or, if it is a ready-to-use mixture diluted by the user, calculated on the basis of the weight of the solids content of the use mixture as specified, and wherein the liquid phase contains one or more oils selected among specifically defined non-paraffinic carbon hydride oils and ester oils with one or two ester groups so that the total oil content of the defined oil components constitutes 4 to 85 % by weight, calculated on the basis of weight of the total composition or, if it is a ready-to-use mixture diluted by the user, is calculated on the basis of weight of the solids content of said mixture and wherein said herbicidal compositions optionally contain water and for instance a filler and wherein the liquid phase is capable of forming an oil-in-water emulsion when the composition is mixed with water. Said herbicidal compositions contain one or more emulsifiers in an amount of from 1 to 18 % by weight, calculated on the basis of the weight of the total composition or, if it is a ready-to-use mixture diluted by the user, calculated on the basis of weight of the solids content of said mmixture. A more stable and advantageous product is obtained by using a reduced amount of emulsifier component.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to herbicidal compositions
in which the herbicidal component is suspended in fine-grained
form in a flowable oil-containing liquid phase,
containing at least one component selected from the
group of beet herbicides consisting of phenmedipham
(methyl-(3-(3-tolylcarbamoyloxy)phenyl)carbamate,
ethofumesate ((±)-2-ethoxy-2,3-dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-benzofuran-5-yl,
methane sulfonate) and metamitron (4-amino-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-6-phenyl-1,2,4-triazin-5-one), so that the total quantity of herbicide therein
constitutes 1 to 50% by weight, and further containing
water, one or more emulsifiers, special oils as defined
below and optionally other oils and e.g. a filler, and
wherein said liquid phase is capable of forming an oil-in-water
emulsion when the composition is mixed with
water.Moreover, the invention relates to analogous
mixtures ready for use.Solvent-based pesticides for use in agriculture
are generally marketed as liquid, completely soluble
concentrates to be diluted with water prior to the
final use so as to be sprayed on the fields or plants
by means of conventional spray equipment. During the
dilution process with water prior to the final use and
by stirring without particular precautions the dissolved
pesticide component may migrate from the oily
phase into the added aqueous phase, the oil being at
the same time emulsified in the water, thereby forming
an oil-in-water emulsion.Shelf-life-stable, aqueous suspensions of pesticides
(flowables) to be diluted with water are being
increasingly used during recent years. Several environmental
advantages are connected with products of that
type. Compared to e.g. dispersable powdery products 
there are no problems with dust and compared to emulsion
concentrates, in which the pesticide is dissolved
in a solvent that is emulsified in water by means of
surfactants it is possible to avoid the use of toxic
and unpleasant solvents.Another known, but not especially widespread
type of pesticide concentrates is an oily pesticide
suspension in which the oil may be emulsified in water.
When such a composition is diluted in water for final
use, the emulsifier must be capable of distributing the
oil without forming gels or lumps and distribute the
pesticide in the aqueous phase. It is important that
the distribution in the aqueous phase is effected
rapidly and without difficulties. In view of the fact
that most of the field crop spray equipments nowadays
include effective stirring means, it may be accepted
that a minor separation of oil or pesticide
