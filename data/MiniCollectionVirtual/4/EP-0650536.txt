<ABSTRACT>
A reactor (10) defines a chamber (11) in which are disposed an upper electrode (12) and a lower workpiece electrode (13). The upper electrode is connected to a R.F. supply whilst the lower electrode is connected to a stress control unit (14). The stress control unit is used to adjust or maintain the effective resistance of the connection between the workpiece electrode (13) and ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and methods
relating to the deposition of films on workpieces and in
particular to the stress set up in those films during the
deposition process.The need to deposit thin layers of material
particularly arises in the manufacture of semi-conductor
devices, but this invention is not limited to the
manufacture of such devices. However, in that field it is
generally recognised that it is desirable to attempt to
control the stress set up in the film during deposition,
because if not controlled the stresses can be sufficient to
lift the film from the surface of the workpiece. It has
been known for a long time that such stresses can be
controlled, to a degree, by altering process parameters such
as pressure, temperature, gas flow rates, etc. However,
variations in these parameters generally cause variations in
other physical characteristics of the film and so the user
of this approach generally settles on a compromise.In plasma chemical vapour deposition processes it is
known that the stress can be controlled by altering the
frequency of the AC field which maintains the plasma
discharge. However the frequency range in which stress is
a minimum is also the band used for aircraft communication
and so this technique is prohibited. Other proposals have
been made for either switching between high and low 
frequency or providing a mix of frequencies but these too
have their problems.JP-A-63317676, JP-A-62243765, and JP-A-58159843 all
describe film forming or plating apparatus wherein a power
supply is used to adjust the bias of a workpiece electrode
support.According to the present invention there is provided
Plasma Excited Chemical Vapour Deposition apparatus
comprising a chamber radio frequency means for forming a
plasma within the chamber, an electrode for supporting a
workpiece, means for allowing gas to be introduced into the
chamber such that a film can be deposited on the workpiece
and means for connecting the electrode to ground by
a variable resistance for draining the voltage from the electrode.From a further aspect the invention consists in Plasma
Excited Chemical Vapour Deposition apparatus comprising a
chamber, radio frequency means for forming a plasma within
the chamber, an electrode for supporting a workpiece, means
for allowing gas to be into the chamber such that a film can
be deposited on the workpiece, means for connecting the
electrode to ground and adjustable means for varying the
effective resistance of the connection between the electrode
and ground by
