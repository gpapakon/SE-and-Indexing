<ABSTRACT>
It is possible by means of the method according to the invention, and of the arrangement specified for carrying out the method, for absolute interferometry using radiation generated by laser diode for relative or absolute distance measurement to be carried out without a reference interferometer using only a single detector and with high accuracy in the determination of the measured distance. The fundamental idea of the invention consists in modulating the radiation generated by the diode laser in such a way that at least one discrete frequency is impressed on the diode laser and is then detected by means of a phase-sensitive detection method known per se. The modulation of the original radiation of the diode laser generates, as it were, a second laser beam, with the result that a measurement and reference beam result in a single beam path. Both beams, i.e. the measuring beam and the reference beam each possess a different frequency, but exhibit parallel wave fronts, cover exactly the same optical path in the uniform (standardised) beam path, and interfere on the single detector. The determination of the measured distance is then performed by the abovementioned determination of the phase shift, or by determining the change in phase of the modulation signal. As an alternative, the modulation frequency of the diode laser is varied until a prescribed phase shift has been detected by the detector, or has been carried out, between the original first beam of the diode laser and the second beam, of altered frequency, generated by modulation. By determining the modulation frequency at which the prescribed phase shift is achieved and forming a difference with respect to the output modulation frequency, the absolute magnitude of the measured distance can be inferred.
