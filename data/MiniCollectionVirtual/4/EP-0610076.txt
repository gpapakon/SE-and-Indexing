<ABSTRACT>
Compounds isolated from a marine sponge, and 
derivatives thereof, have the formulae: 


in which R¹ is H or lower alkyl; R² is OH or CH₃; 
R³ is OH or CH³, and R⁴ H or MPTA. The compounds 

have antitumor and antiviral activity. The invention 
also provides pharmaceutical compositions containing the 

compounds and methods of treatment employing them.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with cytotoxic compounds
isolated from a marine sponge.Norsesterterpene peroxides from the sponge
Sigmosceptrella laevis are reported in Tetrahedron 38
(1982) 1881. Cytotxic sesquiterpene quinones are
reported in Tetrahedron 48 (1992) 6667.It has been found, in accordance with the present
invention, that certain compounds which may be isolated
from a Mycale sp sponge, and derivatives thereof, have
cytotoxic activity.According to the invention there are provided, as
new compounds, 1,2-dioxane compounds of the formula:-

in which R1 is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group such as a methyl group, and
R2 and R3 are each a hydroxyl or methyl group. 
The invention also provides compounds of formula (I)
in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salts.The compounds of formula (I) in which R1 is
hydrogen are obtained from a Mycale sp sponge. The
Mycale sp. sponge was collected at a depth of 5m around
Kang Ta Shin off Sichang Island in Thai Bay. It was
observed to inhabit a place having some currents. The
color was light blue to grey. When collected, it gave
off mucus and most of the sponge material dissolves
leaving behind a fine tissue-like skeleton. In the
water small sea cucumbers were observed residing on the
surfaces of most of the sponge colony. It appears that 
the sea cucumbers were not eating the sponge but foreign
matter on the surface.Basically, the compounds may be isolated from the
sponge by steeping in methanol, concentrating the
extract and extracting with methylene chloride. The two
compounds may be separated by gel chromatography and
HPLC. The separated compounds may be subsequently
esterified.As noted above, compounds in accordance with the
invention have cytotoxic properties.Therefore, the present invention also provides compounds for use in a
method of treating any mammal affected by a malignant
tumor sensitive to compounds above described, which
comprises administering to the affected individual a
therapeutically effective amount of these compounds or a
pharmaceutically composition thereof; and a method of
treating viral infections in mammals, comprising
administering to a patient in need of such treatment, an
antiviral effective amount of the compounds described in
the present invention. In particular the compounds of
the invention may be used in the treatment of mammalian
lymphoma; human lung carcinoma and human colon carcinoma. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical
preparations which contain as active ingredient these
compounds, or a
