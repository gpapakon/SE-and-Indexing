<ABSTRACT>
A shower screen includes a swinging leaf (2) which is mounted pivotably with respect to a frame profile (4) by means of a hinge, permanent magnets (24, 26) being provided as sealing elements between the swinging leaf (2) and the frame profile (4). This shower screen is to be further developed such that, with high functional reliability, good sealing and low wear are achieved while avoiding frictional losses. As a solution, it is proposed that the one permanent magnet (24) is arranged in the region of a concave inner face (14) of the frame profile (4), that the other permanent magnet (26) is arranged in the region of a convex outer face (16) of a profile (12) of the swinging door (2), and that at least the inner face (14) or the outer face (16) is arranged substantially coaxially with respect to the swinging axis (6) of the swinging leaf (2).

Shower partition comprising a swivel panel (2) and a 
profiled frame (4), the swivel panel (2) being mounted to 

swivel in relation to the profiled frame (4) by means of a 
hinge, sealing elements situated opposite one another in 

the closed position of the swivel panel (2) and arranged, 
on the one hand, in the region of a concave inner surface 

(14) of the profiled frame (4) and, on the other hand, in 
the region of a convex outer surface (16) of a profile 

section (12) of the swivel panel (2) being provided between 
the swivel panel (2) and the profiled frame (4), at least 

the inner surface (14) and the outer surface (16) being 
arranged substantially coaxially with the swivel axis (6) 

of the swivel panel (2), characterised in that the sealing 
elements are permanent magnets (24, 26) and that the 

respective opposing outer surfaces of the permanent magnets 
(24, 26) are arranged substantially flush with the inner 

surface (14) of the profiled frame (4) and the outer 
surface (16) of the profile section (12) of the swivel 

panel, a narrow gap being present between the outer 
surfaces of the permanent magnets (24, 26) in the closed 

position of the swivel panel (2). 
Shower partition according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the permanent magnets (24, 26) are magnetic str
ips 
arranged in longitudinal grooves (20, 22) in the profiled 

frame (4) or in the profile section (12) of the swivel 
panel (2). 
Shower partition according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the inner surface (14) of the 

profiled frame (4) and the outer surface (16) of the 
profile section (12) of the swivel panel (2) are  

 
cylindrical, in particular a narrow annular gap of a 

predetermined magnitude (18) being present between these 
surfaces. 
Shower partition according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the concave inner surface (14) and/or 

the convex outer surface (16) of the profile section (12) 
of the swivel panel extends over a circumferential angle 

(64, 66) which is preferably at least 90°, advantageously 
between 90° and 150° and in particular essentially 130° 

and/or that in the open position of the swivel panel (2), 
the inner surface (14) and the outer surface (16) overlap 

one another over a predetermined sector (68), a narrow 
annular gap preferably being present in this sector (68). 
Shower partition according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the profile section (12) of the 

swivel panel and/or the profiled frame (4) are 
asymmetrical, the permanent magnets (24, 26) being arranged 

at an angle (32) advantageously in the range between 30° 
and 60°, preferably between 40° and 50° and in particular 

essentially 45° to a vertical plane (30) coinciding with 
the centre plane of the swivel panel (2) in the closed 

position thereof. 
Shower partition according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the profiled frame (4) is arranged so 

that it can be aligned in relation to a profiled wall (8) 
rigidly connected to a room wall (10), in particular 

releasable screwed or clipped connections being provided. 
Shower partition according to claim 6, characterised in  
 

that a connecting body (38) fixed in the profiled frame (4) 
and in which a screw (36) engages is provided in order to 

connect the profiled frame (4) and the profiled wall (8), 
one arm (44) of the profiled cover (4) being brought to 

bear under tension against one arm of the profiled wall (8) 
by means of the screw (36). 
Shower partition according to claim 6 or claim 7, 
characterised in that a spacer (46) with a bore (48) 

through which the screw (34) engages is arranged in the 
profiled wall (8). 
Shower partition according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that a profiled cover (52) is provided and 

is connected to the profiled frame (4) in particular by 
means of snap connections. 
Shower partition according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the profiled cover (52) has an inner surface (58) 

which is arranged coaxially with the swivel axis (6) and 
has substantially the same radius as the inner surface (14) 

of the profiled frame, this inner surface (58) forming an 
extension of the inner surface (14) of the profiled frame 

(4).
