<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a turbine blade
for a gas turbine according to the first part of claim 1
having an excellent creep strength, to a manufacturing
method of the same, and to a gas turbine including the
blades.Conventionally, blades of a gas turbine for
power generation have been mainly made of a Ni-base
superalloy. However, in order to improve the thermal
efficiency of the gas turbine, the temperature of the
combustion gas has been increased year by year.
Accordingly, to enhance a heat resistance of the blade,
materials for the blade have been shifted from equiaxed
structure by conventional casting to columnar grain
metal structure by unidirectional solidification, and
also, internal cooling of the blade has been tried by
forming a complicated cooling hole inside of the blade.Most of columnar grain structure castings are
manufactured by a unidirectional solidification method
disclosed in JP-B-51-4186. In this method,
a mold is withdrawn downwardly from a heated furnace so
as to effect gradual solidification upwardly from the
lower end. With this, a blade having 
columnar grains of a crystal orientation of 〈100〉, which
are elongated in the longitudinal direction in which the
centrifugal stress acts, has been manufactured to
thereby improve the creep strength property and thermal
fatigue strength property.As a blade which is more excellent in high-temperature
properties than the columnar grain blade,
manufacturing methods of blades for combustion turbines
each comprising a blade portion of a single crystal and
a root portion of fine grains are disclosed in JP-A-60-261659
and JP-A-61-71168.In order to further enhance the efficiency, it
is the most effective method to increase the combustion
gas temperature. For this purpose, the internal cooling
must be improved, and the high-temperature strength of
the material must be also increased.An inner cooling hole of a blade of a gas
turbine is formed by use of a ceramic core. In order to
further improve the cooling, not only the number of
cooling paths has been increased but also the metal
section has been decreased in thickness. The blade of a
columnar crystal structure is manufactured by the
unidirectional solidification method. Molten metal is
solidified with the core incorporated therein, and then,
it is cooled down to a room temperature. During
cooling, thermal contraction occurs. When coefficients
of thermal expansion of the core and the casting metal
are compared, the core exhibits a value about a tenth 
smaller than the metal. In consequence, the
