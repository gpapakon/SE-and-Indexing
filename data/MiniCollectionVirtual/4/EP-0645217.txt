A mallet comprising at least one striker insert (2) held in a
housing (1) and a handle socket (3) connected to the housing (1), for the

mallet handle (16), wherein the housing (1) and the handle socket (3) are
composed of two half-shell portions (5, 6) which bear against each other in

a plane passing through the longitudinal axis (4) of the housing (1) and of
the handle socket (3) and are firmly connected to each other at the edges,

and wherein the two half-shell portions (5, 6) are each formed in one
respective piece, characterised in that a part of the cavity (12) formed in

the housing (1) is filled with shot (14), wherein the opening (13) formed by
the handle socket (3) is provided for filling the cavity (12).
A mallet according to claim 1 characterised in that the opening
(13) is closable by a releasably inserted plug (15).
A mallet according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that both
half-shell portions (5, 6) are formed in one piece from a common sheet

metal blank.
A mallet according to claim 3 characterised in that both half-shell
portions (5, 6) are connected together at the housing (1).
A mallet according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that the
half-shell portions (5, 6) which are connected together at the edges are

welded together at their mutual contact surfaces of the housing (1) and/or
the handle socket (3) or are non-releasably connected in another fashion.
A mallet according to one of claims 1 to 5 characterised in that in
the transitional region between the housing (1) and the handle socket (3)

there is provided a reinforcing rib (7) formed by edge strips which at the
edge adjoin each of the half-shell portions, wherein the two edge strips

which jointly form a reinforcing rib (7) bear flat against each other and are
welded together at their free edge. 
A mallet according to one of claims 1 to 6 characterised in that at
each of its two ends the housing (1) has an opening (8) in which an impact

plate (9) is arranged at a spacing relative to the edge of the opening (8),
the striker insert (2) which is fitted into the housing bearing against the

impact plate.
A mallet according to claim 7 characterised in that the impact
plate (9) is provided at its edge with a flange which terminates flush with

the edge of the opening (8) and which is welded thereto or non-releasably
connected thereto in another fashion.
A mallet according to one of claims 1 to 8 characterised in that the
striker insert (2) in the housing (1) is of a non-round cross-section to

prevent it from rotating.

(1) and the striker insert (2) are of a rectangular cross-sectional

configuration.
A mallet according to one of claims 1 to 10 characterised in that
beads (11) are formed in the housing (1) to stiffen the housing wall.
A mallet according to claim 11 characterised in that the beads
(11) are oriented parallel to the edge of the opening (8) and form

abutments for the impact plate (9).
