<ABSTRACT>
A packetized cellular system (5) in which a mobile (14) quasi-periodically 
transmits a beacon signal containing an ID number to a first base station 

(10) in the cell (6) in which it is located for storage with the ID's of other active 
mobiles in the cell. A copy of a list of the active mobiles in that cell is transmitted to 

all adjacent cells (6) where they are placed on an non-active list. Control of a mobile 
is handed-off to a second base station (10) upon the receipt of a transmitted ID 

number of the mobile at the second base station (10). The mobile is then listed as 
active in the database of the second base station and non-active in the first base 

station.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packetized cellular communication systems,
and to methods of signalling between a mobile and a base station in a
packetized cellular system.There is increasing interest in wireless data
communications, such as mobile computing, wireless
messaging, facsimile, file transfer, and database access.
Together with the trend of untethering computers from the
desktop and the desire for universal connectivity,
packetized cellular communications is becoming more and
more important, and is being considered as the third
generation of wireless networks.Typical cellular networks are comprised of a large
number of base stations. Each base station has an assigned
coverage area ( i.e. cell). In order for a mobile terminal
to initiate a call, the cellular phone of the mobile is
powered on and it scans the frequencies of a group of
control channels for the strongest reception available.
Once the appropriate control channel has been selected
there is an exchange of messages between the base station
and the mobile phone wherein the called terminal number is
forwarded to the base station and a transmission channel is
allocated to the mobile phone.Undesirably, such a procedure requires that the mobile
handset has the capability to : (1) scan a band of
frequencies, (2) make power measurements, and (3) transmit
the power measurements to the base station. Substantial
functionality in the handset is required. Accordingly,
there is a need for a technique that minimizes such
processing to increase the efficiency of the mobile
terminal. Additionally, during an active communication, a mobile
terminal that is leaving the coverage area of one base
station must be "handed-off" to the next base station,
whose coverage is the one the mobile is entering. In
existing circuit switched systems this hand-off process is
done via continuous communications between the base station
and the mobile. Such a technique has its own system-level
switching and control capability - a higher layer in the
mobile network, operating above the individual cells.
Through continuous, real-time measurements and comparisons
of the signal strength received from the individual base
stations, the mobile may initiate the handing-off of its
call in progress to another cell. Such switching of a call
is done "on-the-fly" without dropping or disrupting the
call in progress. In general, substantial overlap in
coverage areas between adjacent cells is required to insure
high quality reception during hand-offs.Unfortunately, such a hand-off technique
