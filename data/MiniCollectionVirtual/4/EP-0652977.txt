<ABSTRACT>
A process for facilitating the removal of impurities e.g. radionuclides, such as uranium and thorium, and/or one or more of their radionuclide daughters, from titaniferous material includes contacting the titaniferous material with one or more reagents at an elevated temperature selected to enhance the accessibility of at least one of the radionuclide daughters in the titaniferous material. The reagent(s) may be a glass forming reagent and is selected to form a phase at the elevated temperature which disperses onto the surfaces of the titaniferous material and incorporates the radionuclides and one or more radionuclide daughters. The titaniferous material may be, e.g., ilmenite, reduced ilmenite, altered ilmenite or synthetic rutile.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for facilitating the removal of impurities
especially but not only radionuclides such as uranium and thorium and their
radionuclide daughters, from titaniferous materials, and is concerned in particular
embodiments with the removal of uranium and thorium from weathered or "altered"
ilmenite and products formed from the ilmenite.Ilmenite (FeTiO3) and rutile (TiO2) are the major commercially-important,
mineral feedstocks for titanium metal and titanium dioxide production. Although
ilmenite and rutile almost invariably occur together in nature as components of
"mineral sands" or "heavy minerals" (along with zircon (ZrSiO4) and monazite ((Ce,
La, Th)PO4)), ilmenite is usually the most abundant. Natural weathering of ilmenite
results in partial oxidation of the iron, originally present in ilmenite in the ferrous
state (Fe2+), to ferric iron (Fe3+). To maintain electrical neutrality, some of the
oxidised iron must be removed from the ilmenite lattice. This results in a more
porous structure with a higher titanium (lower iron) content. Such weathered
materials are known as "altered" ilmenites and may have TiO2 contents in excess of
60%, compared with 52.7% TiO2 in stoichiometric (unaltered) ilmenite. As
weathering, or alteration, of the ilmenite proceeds, impurities such as alumino-silicates
(clays) are often incorporated into the porous structure as discrete, small
grains that reside in the pores of the altered ilmenite. It appears that uranium and
thorium can also be incorporated into the ilmenite pores during this process.Most of the world's mined ilmenite is used for the production of titanium
dioxide pigments for use in the paint and paper industries. Pigment grade TiO2 has
been traditionally produced by reacting ilmenite with concentrated sulphuric acid and
subsequent processing to produce a TiO2 pigment - the so-called sulphate route.
However this process is becoming increasingly undesirable on environmental grounds
due to the large volumes of acidic liquid wastes which it produces. The alternative
process - the so-called chloride route - involves reaction with chlorine to produce
volatile titanium tetrachloride and subsequent oxidation to TiO2. Unlike the sulphate
route, the chloride route is capable of handling feedstocks, such as rutile, which are
high in TiO2 content and low in iron and other impurities. Consequently the chloride-route presents fewer environmental problems and
has become the preferred method for TiO2 pigment production. Also whilst the
sulphate
