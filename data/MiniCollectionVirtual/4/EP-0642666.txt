<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an assay for identifying the presence and/or amount in a test sample of
an antibody which is immunologically reactive with a hepatitis C viral antigen and more specifically, to an assay for
detecting a complex of an antibody and a polypeptide having at least one epitope of a hepatitis C viral antigen.Acute viral hepatitis is clinically diagnosed by a well-defined set of patient symptoms, including jaundice,
hepatic tenderness, and an increase in the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase.
Additional serological immunoassays are generally performed to diagnose the specific type of viral causative agent.
Historically, patients presenting clinical hepatitis symptoms and not otherwise infected by hepatitis A, hepatitis B,
Epstein-Barr, or cytomegalovirus were clinically diagnosed as having non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) by default. The
disease may result in chronic liver damage.Each of the well-known, immunologically characterized hepatitis-inducing viruses, hepatitis A virus (HAV),
hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis D virus (HDV) belongs to a separate family of viruses and has a distinctive viral
organization, protein structure and mode of replication.Attempts to identify the NANBH virus by virtue of genomic similarity to one of the known hepatitis viruses
have failed, suggesting that NANBH has a distinct organization and structure. Fowler et al., J. Med. Virol. 12:205-213
(1983) and Weiner et al., J. Med. Virol. 21:239-247 (1987).Progress in developing assays to detect antibodies specific for NANBH has been particularly hampered by
difficulties in correctly identifying antigens associated with NANBH. See, for example, J. Wands et al., U.S. Patent
4,870,076, Wands et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. 83:6608-6612 (1986),Ohori et al., J. Med. Virol. 12:161-178 (1983), Bradley
et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. 84:6277-6281 (1987), T. Akatsuka et al., J. Med. Virol. 20:43-56 (1986), B. Seto et al.,

et al., PCT Application PCT/EP88/00123.Recently, another hepatitis-inducing virus has been unequivocally identified as hepatitis C virus (HCV) by M.
Houghton et al., European Patent Application publication number 0 318 216, May 31, 1989. Related papers describing
this virus include G. Kuo et al., Science 244:359-361 (1989) and Q. Choo et al., Science 244:362-364 (1989). M.
