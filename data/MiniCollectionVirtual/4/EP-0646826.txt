<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a means of erasing the 
magnetic hysteresis with respect to a rare-earth iron garnet 

single-crystal film with large magnetic hysteresis which is an 
obstacle in using as a Faraday rotator although the film has 

extremely small saturated magnetic field intensity. 
In the present invention, a permanent magnet is positioned 
on a part of a rare-earth iron garnet single crystal. 
According to the present invention, the magnetic hysteresis 
can be erased with respect to a rare-earth iron garnet 

single-crystal film with large magnetic hysteresis which is an 
obstacle in using as a Faraday rotator although the film has 

extremely small saturated magnetic field intensity. As the result, 
an optical switch utilizing Faraday effect and a magneto-optical 

sensor with a Faraday rotator applied a rare-earth iron 
garnet single-crystal film which has small saturated magnetic 

field intensity are enabled to utilize practically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to means to make use of a 
rare-earth iron garnet single-crystal film with large magnetic 
hysteresis as a Faraday rotator utilized for magneto-optical 
sensors and optical switches. More particularly, the invention relates to means to make 
it possible to apply even a rare-earth iron garnet single-crystal 
film with large magnetic hysteresis to a Faraday rotator , 
by erasing the magnetic hysteresis which is an obstacle to the 
use of the film as a Faraday rotator of magneto-optical sensors 
and optical switches. In recent years, the optical switches or the devices 
which are called an optical current sensor and an optical 
rotation sensor, utilizing a rare-earth iron garnet single-crystal 
film with large Faraday effect , have been putted to practical 
use in succession. Further, the exploitation of rare-earth 
iron garnet single-crystal films in accordance with those uses 
has been carried out actively. Faraday effect is a kind of magneto-optical effects and 
a rotation phenomenon of a polarization plane of a light ray 
which passes through materials having Faraday effect, i.e., 
Faraday elements (Faraday rotator) such a rare-earth iron garnet 
single-crystal film. And, the rotation angle in the polarization  
 
plane is proportional to the magnetization intensity, as shown in 
Fig. 1.
 
In Fig. 1, the angle of the Faraday rotation is zero, i.e., 
which is positioned at the origin(o), when no external magnetic 
fields are applied. In accordance with successive increasing in the intensity 
of the magnetic field, the absolute value of the Faraday rotation 
angle (ϑF or -ϑF, clockwise is plus and counterclockwise is 
minus normally ) proceeds via the point a or the point d, and 
increases gradually (the route o-a-b, or the route o-d-e). The 
Faraday rotation angle reaches the saturated value ( the saturated 
magnetic field : the point b or e), when the external magnetic 
field intensity gets to an intensity value (Hs). Even if the 
external magnetic field intensity increases further, the Faraday 
rotation angle makes no change and only transits from b to c or 
from e to f, because the Faraday rotation angle has reached to 
the saturated value. And then, the Faraday rotation angle traces the reverse 
route, i.e., the route c-b-a-o or f-e-d-o, while the external 
magnetic field intensity is reduced gradually, and returns back 
to the origin o when the external magnetic field finally comes to 
make no effects. As mentioned above, the devices to utilize the 
characteristic :
