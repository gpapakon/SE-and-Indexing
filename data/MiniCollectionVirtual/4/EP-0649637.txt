<ABSTRACT>
An at least partially preformed polymeric product 
for paving or sealing the interior surface of a tissue 

lumen (171) by entering the interior of the tissue lumen (171) and 
applying said polymer to the interior surface of the 

tissue lumen (171). 
The polymer can be delivered to the lumen (171) as a 

monomer or prepolymer solution, or as an at least 
partially preformed layer (172).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to partially pre-formed polymeric products 
for the invivo paving and sealing of the interior of organs 
or organ components and other tissue cavities. 
The tissues involved may be 
those organs or structures having hollow or tubular 
geometry, for example blood vessels such as arteries 
or veins, in which case the polymeric products are 
deposited within the naturally occurring lumen. 
Alternatively, the tissue may be a normally solid 
organ in which a cavity has been created either as a 
result of an intentional surgical procedure or an 
accidental trauma. In this case, the polymeric 
product is deposited in the lumen of the cavity. Often times, the hollow or tubular geometry of 
organs has functional significance such as in the 
facilitation of fluid or gas transport (blood, urine, 
lymph, oxygen or respiratory gases) or cellular 
containment (ova, sperm). Disease processes may 
affect these organs or their components by encroaching 
upon, obstructing or otherwise reducing the cross-sectional 
area of the hollow or tubular elements. 
Additionally, other disease processes may violate the 
native boundaries of the hollow organ and thereby 
affect its barrier function and/or containment 
ability. The ability of the organ or structure to 
properly function is then severely compromised. A 
good example of this phenomena can be seen by 
reference to the coronary arteries. Coronary arteries, or arteries of the heart, 
perfuse the actual cardiac muscle with arterial blood. 
They also provide essential nutrients and allow for  
 
removal of metabolic wastes and for gas exchange. 
These arteries are subject to relentless service 
demands for continuous blood flow throughout the life 
of the patient. Despite their critical life supporting function, 
coronary arteries are often subject to attack through 
several disease processes, the most notable being 
atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries. 
Throughout the life of the patient, multiple factors 
contribute to the development of microscopic and/or 
macroscopic vascular lesions known as plaques. The development of a plaque lined vessel 
typically leads to an irregular inner vascular surface 
with a corresponding reduction of vessel cross-sectional 
area. The progressive reduction in cross-sectional 
area compromises flow through the vessel. 
For example, the effect on the coronary arteries, is a 
reduction in blood flow to the cardiac muscle. This 
reduction in blood flow, with corresponding reduction 
in nutrient and oxygen supply,
