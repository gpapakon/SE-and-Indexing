<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to esophageal dilators, and
more particularly, to hollow rubber dilators filled with
flowable material for treating a constricted esophagus.
Stenosis or esophageal stricture, i.e. a narrowing or
constricting of the passageway diameter of a patient's
esophagus, is associated with several diseases and
conditions which affect human beings. Such conditions
include, for example, cancer, esophagitis, hernia,
cardiospasm, and others associated with the inflammation
and/or stricture of the esophagus. For example,
cardiospasm is a condition affecting the esophagogastric
sphincter, a thick muscular ring between the esophagus and
stomach, which is associated with failure of the muscle to
relax during swallowing, thus creating an obstruction of
the esophageal passageway.Esophageal strictures prevent the normal peristaltic
activities of the esophagus and may impede the patient's
ability to swallow and/or block access to the digestive
tract. Treatment often requires dilation of the esophagus
at its junction with the stomach.There are several esophageal dilators known in the
art. One such dilator is a bougie having a hollow, central
channel extending the length of the bougie, for insertion 
on a guide wire previously placed in the patient. This
type of dilator is most often used with tight strictures
that are 1.2 centimeters, or less, in diameter. Another
type of dilator is a wire-guided balloon dilator. The
guide wire locates the balloon in the stricture, and
thereafter, the balloon is slowly inflated. The balloon
dilator is best used in asymmetrical strictures that are
1.2 centimeters, or more, in diameter.Another type of esophageal dilator is the
mercury-filled rubber bougie. The bougie comprises a
rubber sheath filled with mercury, and having a tapered
tip. The bougie is inserted, tip-first, through a
patient's mouth and into the esophagus, applying light
pressure to enlarge the diameter of the stricture. The
rubber bougie is best used in treating strictures which are
symmetrical and more than 1.2 centimeters in diameter.
Since most esophageal strictures meet these requirements,
the rubber bougie is the most commonly used esophageal
dilator.The mercury core provides the weight necessary for
proper performance of the dilator, and, because Mercury is
liquid at ambient and body temperatures, it allows flexing
of the dilator.Ribs can form in the surface of a rubber dilator at
the location of a tight bend, and can cause damage to the
interior lining of the patient's esophagus. The Mercury
