<ABSTRACT>
In a storage and transportation rack for flat structural members with essentially the same format, supporting arms (6, 7, 8) mounted pivotably on carriers (1) fixed to the rack can each be pivoted individually in succession by respective pull members (15) counter to a restoring force out of a pivoted-in position of rest (A) by way of an intermediate position (B) into a supporting position (C), an identical projected dimension (a) for the front edge of the bearing surface (12) parallel to the pivot axis (5) being obtained for the intermediate position and the supporting position by parallel bending lines (10, 10', 10'') which produce part surfaces angled relative to one another and relative to the bearing surface.

Rack for storing and handling panel-shaped elements of essentially the same 
format, comprising stanchions (1) arranged in parallel and fastened at the 

rack, which comprise, in correspondence with a uniform subdivision in the vertical 
direction, equidistant hearing points for supporting the pivots (5) of individual 

supports (6, 7, 8) whereof each is pivotable in opposition to a restoring 
force, from a retracted inoperative position (A) via an intermediate position (B), 

which is available simultaneously for all stanchions (1) for joint charging with a 
panel-shaped element, into a supporting position (C) which is limited by a stop 

position at said, with the pivoting movements in succession of said supports (6, 
7, 8) from said inoperative position (A) into said intermediate position (B) being 

controlled by means of tension rods (15) which are anchored at said supports 
and disposed in front of the respective pivot (5) of said supports on their support 

sides and which present an effective traction length so as to control the 
pivoting movement of said supports (6, 7, 8) in succession from their inoperative 

position (A) into their intermediate position (B), with each tension rod (15) 
being so configured that it presents a sheet metal strip and a backlash connector 

limited by its effective traction length for connection to its anchorage points 
at the two respectively associated supports which are provided with elongate 

openings (13, 14) which are provided in pairs in a bent section (11) of each 
support (6, 7, 8), which section is adjacent to said pivot (5) and bent by means 

of a bending line (10) parallel to the pivot, said section forming a limiting stop 
for the stop position of its supporting surface (12),
characterized in
 that said section (11) of each support (6, 7, 8) is 
subdivided by at least one additional bending line (10', 10'') into two sub- surfaces  

 
(11', 11'', 11''') which are bent with respect to each other and to said supporting 

surface (12) so as to form a horizontal spacing (a), substantially of the 
same length relative to said pivot (5) for the leading edge of said supporting 

surface (12) in parallel with said pivot (5), not only in the intermediate (B) but 
also in the supporting position (C) of said supports (6, 7, 8). 
Storing and handling rack according to Claim 1, wherein said bent section 
(11) is subdivided by two parallel bending lines (10', 10'') into three sub-surface 

(11', 11'', 11''') which are bent in alternation to either side so that the middle 
sub-surface (11'') is larger than the outside sub-surface (11', 11''') adjoining 

said supporting surface (12) and said pivot (5). 
Storing and handling rack according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the respective 

one of said two elongate openings (13, 14) which are provided for anchoring 
said tension rods (15) in each support (6, 7, 8) is formed in each of said two 

outside bent sub-surface (11, 11'''). 
Storing and handling rack according to any of the Claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
anchoring of each tension rod (15), which is provided in one of said elongate 

openings (13), is achieved by means of two wire springs (16, 17), resilient 
clamps or similar elements on either side of one of said sub-surfaces (1') of 

said bent portion (11), which are resiliently placed in two mutually spaced 
punched openings (16', 17') at the first end of tension rod (15), which is inserted 

through one of said elongate openings (13), and which determine the 
effective traction length of said tension rod in co-operation with a T-formation 

(18) of the second end of the tension rod, which is passed through the second 
elongate opening (14) of the second sub-surface (11''') of the adjacent support.
