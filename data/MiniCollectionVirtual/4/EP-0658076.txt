<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a housing for telecommunications installations of a modular type whose individual module can be expanded by externally similar modules to form larger installations having improved performance. The individual module consists of a base trough (10) and of a cap (20) having ventilation slots (21) for wall mounting, a mounting rack (30) being mounted on the base trough (10), which mounting rack (30) forms (in conjunction with a cover (50) and in conjunction with the base trough (10) or a sheet-metal insert in the base trough (10)) a Faraday cage for plug-in assemblies (70) which are to be accommodated. A rear-wall wiring panel (40) is mounted on spacer columns (41) on the base trough (10). The plug connectors are located in the Faraday cage of the mounting rack (30) and are fitted with plug connectors at the sides under plug screening caps (42) for connection to the bus systems of other modules. An electrical power supply unit (60) is mounted in the base trough (10), in which it is suspended by means of two tabs (61) in two contours of the base trough and is secured on the opposite side by a screw connection (62).
