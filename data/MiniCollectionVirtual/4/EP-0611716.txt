<ABSTRACT>
When a new roll is changed in an off-machine coating 
line into the unwinder (1), problems are encountered in 

matching the tension of the web (16) received from the 
expiring roll (13) to that to be paid off from the new roll 

(12). Differences in web tension cause web breaks 
during roll change. According to the assembly, the web 

is supported at the unwinder (1), and subsequently, at 
the following dryer cylinder group (2) by means of a 

support felt (3) serving to the end of equalizing 
differences in web tension. The web received from the 

first roll (13) is spliced to the tail of a second, full roll 
(12) by pressing the web (16) received from the first roll 

against the web of the second roll via a support felt (3) 
by means of a splicing roll. Next, the web is fed 

supported by the felt (3) to a dryer cylinder group (2) 
comprising vacuum and steam cylinders (20,21) where the 

damp web is dried for subsequent coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assembly according to the preamble of claim 1 
suited for use in an off-machine coating line or other paper web finishing line in 
the handling of a paper web received from an unwinder and then routing said web 
to a coating machine. The paper web manufactured in a paper machine is finished either using on-machine 
equipment directly following the paper machine, whereby the base sheet 
outgoing the paper machine is coated and finished with equipment having a width 
and speed compatible with the those of the paper machine, or alternatively, using 
off-machine equipment, whereby the output of a single paper machine can be 
handled by a plurality of finishing equipment. The major benefits of on-machine 
systems are their high productivity and the possibility of attaining a finished 
product in a single process. In off-machine equipment the properties of the 
finished product can be varied in a more flexible manner and often they can give 
higher quality. The configuration of an off-machine coating can be widely varied and such equipment 
is always tailored to customer specifications. Thus, a coating line can 
include, e.g., an unwinder, several coater stations, dryers and a calender. The last 
unit in the line is a rewinder. Paper web handling in off-machine equipment occurs in the following manner. 
Base web rolls manufactured in a paper machine are transferred to the finishing 
line and lifted onto the unwind stands to wait for their finishing turn. After the 
preceding roll is finished, a new base web roll can be transferred onto the unwind 
stand. Roll change is made by stopping the line, then feeding the web tail of the 
new roll through the line using low speed, and finally accelerating the web to the 
normal running speed. Because the roll change in this manner is slow, the current 
practice is to aim at roll changes without stopping the equipment.  
 From the unwinder station the web passes to a first coater, then to the dryers, to the 
second coater station, and then further alternately to dryers and coaters, depending 
on how many coater stations are included in the line and how many coats are 
being applied to the end product. Subsequent to coating, the web can be calendered 
in a calender included in the line, or alternatively, in a separate calender. 
At the end of the finishing line the web is again wound into a roll by means of a 
rewinder. One of the problems in off-machine finishing lines of the above-described type is 
in the roll change. Though the

<CLAIMS>
An assembly for a web finishing line comprising at least 

a continuously operating unwinder station (1) incorporating at least a 
primary unwinder in which the web is unwound from a web roll (12) and a 

secondary unwinder to which the expiring web roll can be transferred after 
its diameter has become smaller, whereby a sequence can be 

performed in which a new web roll is transferred to the primary unwinder, 
the web on the new web roll is spliced with the web (16) being paid off 

from the secondary unwinder and then the web (16) from the 
secondary unwinder is cut, 
at least one piece (4) of finishing equipment, and 
a rewinder (10), 
characterized
 by 

a driven support felt (3), 
rolls (17-21, 25) over which the support felt (3) is adapted to pass as 
an endless loop
 so that 

at least one of said rolls is a transferable roll (18) which 
is adapted to cooperate with the web (16) received from the 

secondary unwinder of the unwinder station (1) in such a manner 
that said web (16) travels on the support felt at said transferable roll 

(18) and said transferable roll (18) is movable toward the web roll (12) 
resting in the primary unwinder to the end of pressing 

the web (16) received from the secondary unwinder via 
the felt (3) against the surface of the web roll (12), and  

 
at least one (25) of said rolls is a movable tension roll suited 
to the control of the felt tension. 
An assembly as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that at least one 
of said rolls is adapted to act as a guide roll (17) cooperating with the web (16) 

received from the secondary unwinder in such a manner that the felt (3) passing 
over said guide roll (17) and the web intended to travel on the felt meet at said guide roll (17). 
An assembly as defined in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that at 
least one of said rolls is a vacuum cylinder (20). 
An assembly as defined in claim 2, 
characterized
 in that at least one 
of said rolls is a heatable dryer cylinder (21). 
An assembly as defined in any foregoing claim, 
characterized
 by a 
draw roll nip (24) which is adapted to cooperate with the endless loop formed by 

the support felt (3) and is suited to receive the web paid off from the unwinder station (1) 
and travelling supported by the felt (3) to the end of detaching the web from the 

felt (3) 
An assembly as defined in claim 5, 
characterized
 by an edge 
trimmer (23) which is located after the detachment point of the web from the 

support felt (3) but before the draw roll nip (24).
