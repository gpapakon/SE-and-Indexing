<ABSTRACT>
Pollution from industrial plants which produce NOx and waste water is reduced by utilizing waste water to prepare aqueous NOx-reducing solutions (50). Total water hardness in the waste water is preferably maintained below 2500 ppm, silicate below 200 ppm and the calcium to magnesium ratio above 2:1. The aqueous NOx-reducing solution will preferably contain hardness suppressing compositions in effective amounts.

Technical FieldThe invention relates to improving the environmental impact of industrial plants which generate waste water and produce nitrogen oxides (NOχ) . The invention has particular advantage in installations where waste waters having high concentrations of dissolved or suspended solids are produced and injection of aqueous solutions of NH- containing NOχ-reducing agents is feasible. Processes and compositions are provided.Aqueous solutions of NH-containing NOχ-reducing agents such as urea, its hydrolysis products and related amidozine-generating materials, are useful in reducing the environmental damage caused by NOχ from large-scale combustion. Carbonaceous materials, including the typical hydrocarbon fuels such as coal, oil and gas, as well as refuse, are burned in increasing amounts each year. This combustion is a primary source of steam for power genera¬ tion and produces a variety of pollutants which must be removed from the effluents or adverse consequences to the environment will be suffered. Moreover, waste water is produced when spent steam is condensed for recycling or purified by reverse osmosis, or other industrial process waters are cooled in recirculating cooling towers. These waste waters and others produced by industrial processes contain considerable quantities of dissolved and dispersed solids. There are economic, environmental and regulatory restrictions on the discharge of waste waters.The process for cooling steam typically entails indirect heat exchange (such as in a tube and shell heat exchanger) with cooling water. The cooling water can then be cooled in a cooling tower by
