<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for separating milk and air from each other at an early stage in a pipe milking machine, comprising a claw (1) and a pump assembly (10) in flow communication therewith and connected with a vacuum tube (5) and including pump means for pumping milk into a normal-pressure milk pipe (4a) coupled with assembly (10). In the apparatus, negative-pressure milk and air are supplied from claw (1) to pump assembly (10) for effecting the separation of air from milk, followed by pumping the milk into normal-pressure milk pipe (4a). Said supply of milk from claw (1) to pump assembly (10) is essentially effected by gravity alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
Apparatus for separating milk and air from each other at an early stage in a pipe milking machineThe present invention relates to an apparatus for separating milk and air from each other at an early stage in a pipe milking machine, comprising a centrepiece or claw and a pump assembly, which is in flow communication therewith, connected to a vacuum tube, and includes a body element and pump means for pumping milk into a normal-pressure milk pipe connected with the assembly.EP Patent publication 0119222 discloses a method and apparatus for improved milking, wherein milk and air are separated at an early stage by passing the air from a claw in an overhead path into a vacuum tube and by conveying the milk by means of a pump in an underhand path along a vacuum tube into a milk pipe. EP Patent publication 0171403 discloses an apparatus for measuring previously milked milk especially in systems as disclosed in EP Patent publication 0119222.An object of the present invention is to provide an improved apparatus for separating air and milk from each other. In order to achieve this object, an apparatus of the invention is characterized by what is set forth in the characterizing section of claim 1.One benefit offered by an apparatus of the invention is that at no time is it necessary for milk to be drawn up by the direct application of vacuum (by means of air) , the vacuum being only used in the claw for a milking operation (pulsation). Thus, the vacuum prevailing inside a teat cup remains substantially- constant throughout a milking operation. By virtue of this permanently constant vacuum the flow diagram of milk can be made more level and, thus, the milking time can be reduced. 

It is true that the pump means included in a pump assembly make use of vacuum, but operation of the pump means simultaneously effects the separation of milk and air, whereby the milk only is pumped into a normal-pressure milk pipe while air discharges from the pump assembly into the vacuum tube.The invention will now be described with reference made to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate one exemplary embodiment for an apparatus of the invention. In the drawing figures:fig. 1 is a schematic view showing the principle for a pipe milking machine configuration according to prior art,fig. 2 is a schematic view showing the principle for a pipe milking machine configuration employing an apparatus of the invention,figs. 3 - 10 are schematic sectional views showing various operating stages for one embodiment of a pumping assembly for use

Claims
1. An apparatus for separating milk and air from each other at an early stage in a pipe milking machine, said apparatus comprising a milker claw (1) and a pump assembly (10) in flow communication therewith and connected to a vacuum tube (5) and includes a body element (13) provided with an inlet chamber (25, 26) for milk flowing into pump assembly (10), and pump means for pumping milk into a normal-pressure milk pipe (4a) connected with assembly (10), said pump means comprising a milk pump consisting of a milk cylinder (15) and a pump piston (16, 16a) axially movable therein, as well as a vacuum pump consisting of an operating cylinder (18) and an operating piston (19) axially movable therein, said milk cylinder (15) and operating cylinder (18) being mounted one after the other with pump piston (16, 16a) and operating piston (19) coupled functionally with each other, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the inlet chamber (25, 26) is mounted substantially above the plane of milk cylinder (15) in flow communication with milk cylinder (15) whereby, in operation, milk and air flow in the state of vacuum from claw (1) to pump assembly (10), the milk only flowing essentially by the action of gravity, and that the pump assembly (10) uses pump piston (16, 16a) for bringing the milk flowing gravitationally through inlet chamber (25, 26) to milk cylinder (15) upwards to said normal-pressure milk pipe (4a).
2. An apparatus as set forth in claim 1, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that said milk cylinder (15) and operating cylinder (18) are mounted in a substantially horizontal position in the bottom section of pump assembly (10).
3. An apparatus as set forth in claim 2, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the vacuum pump operating cylinder (18) and operating piston (19) are elliptical in cross-section, the 


major axis of the ellipse being extended in a substantially horizontal direction when the vacuum pump is fitted in pump assembly (10).
4. An apparatus as set forth in any of claims 1 - 3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the inlet chamber includes first sensor elements (E) for supplying control signals to control elements (I, II) for operating piston (19), the operation of said first sensor elements (E) being based on the amount of milk contained in the inlet chamber, and that said operating cylinder (18) includes second sensor elements (A, B) for supplying control signals to said control elements (I, II) for operating piston (19), the operation of said second sensor elements (A, B) being based on the position of operating piston (19) in operating cylinder (18), the action of said operating piston (19) being controlled by means of the cooperation between control signals supplied by said first (E) and second (A, B) sensor elements.
5. An apparatus as set forth in claim 4, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the inlet chamber is provided with a partition (27) for dividing the inlet chamber into a receiving chamber (25) for the milk arriving in pump assembly (10) and a filling chamber (26) facing towards the milk pump, the milk or at least an essential part thereof flowing first into receiving chamber (25) and further over the top edge of partition (27) into filling chamber (26) and further to milk cylinder (15), whereby the top section of partition (27) on the side facing said filling chamber (26) is provided with a lip portion (27a), inside which are fitted flow electrodes (E), serving as said first sensor elements and supplying said control signal once the milk pump and said filling chamber (26) are filled to such a degree that said flow electrodes (E) are contacted with each other through the intermediary of milk contained in filling chamber (26). 



 6. An apparatus as set forth in claim 4, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that said second sensor elements comprise a magnet (34) included in operating piston (19) as well as a sensor (A, B) mounted on at least one end of operating cylinder
