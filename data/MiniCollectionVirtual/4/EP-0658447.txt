<ABSTRACT>
Process for manufacturing decorative products, particularly for applying to walls or for use in advertising, in which the representation (work) to be reproduced is transferred by printing onto a planar support (1) consisting of a sheet (2) made from thermoformable plastic. According to the invention, this process is characterised in that it consists in producing, on the said support, in trompe l'oeil, the design of a frame (4) surrounding the reproduction (3) of the work, in thermoforming the plastic material of the support in line with the drawing of the frame in order to cause an embossing, constituting a lath or peripheral structure (5, 6), to appear in the plane of the support, in cutting out this support prior to or subsequent to the thermoforming operation, along the outer contour of the frame, in turning the support over in order to apply it on a support matrix (13), keeping it flat, in injecting or otherwise filling the hollowed-out profile made on the opposite side of the frame with a material (16) capable of becoming stiff, then in separating the support from the matrix in order to form a panel in a single piece including, on one face, the reproduction arranged in the centre of the drawing of the frame and, on the opposite face, a surround accommodated inside the frame and stiffening the latter. The invention also relates to the products obtained by means of this process.
