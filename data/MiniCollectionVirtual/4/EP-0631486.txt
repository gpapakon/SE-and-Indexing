<ABSTRACT>
A perimeter is disclosed in which the projection surface of the bowl includes a hemispherical (H) section bounded by a cylindrical perimeter (C) to impart to the interior projection surface of the instrument a "bullet shaped" profile (S). The perimeter of preferred dimension includes a reduced diameter hemisphere occupying the central 45 DEG  of solid angle from the fixated patient's eye (E). The cylindrical perimeter is joined to the hemisphere and is generated about a cylindrical axis commencing at the spherical center of the hemisphere and extending outward normally from the hemisphere to the point of patient eye placement. The diameter of the cylinder matches and forms a projection continuum with the radius of the hemisphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to perimeters. More
particularly, a perimeter for the eye is disclosed in which the
interior of the bowl perimeter combines a hemisphere with a
conic section, preferably a cylinder, to impart to the interior
projection surface of the instrument a "bullet shaped" profile.
There results reduced instrument dimension and volume to enable
placement of the perimeter in a smaller space with no
appreciable compromise in the quality of perimetry.Perimetry is the science of testing the field of view
of the eye. Such measurements, particularly if they are taken
periodically, can be a useful measure of both the health of the
eye as well as tool for the tracking of any eye disease.Conventional perimeters now in use have large
hemispherical bowls forming an interior concave projection
surface. The patient being examined is faced forward into the
concave hemisphere and positioned with the eye to be examined
located at the center of the hemisphere. When the eye to be
examined is positioned at the center of the hemisphere, the
patient is told to fixate at a fixation target located in the
center of the projection surface of the hemisphere. When the
patient is properly fixated, eye sensitivity is mapped.
Typically, mapping occurs through projection of a light
stimulus to typically randomly selected locations on the bowl
about the fixation point. When these randomly selected
locations are observed, aggregated and "mapped", the perimetry
of the eye is described.Projection of the points of light about the fixation
point to the interior of the bowl for observation by the
patient occurs either statically or dynamically to determine
the boundaries of peripheral vision. During static
examination, light is projected onto the surface of the bowl
with the patient depressing an indicator when the projected 
light is observed. During dynamic examination, light is
projected onto the surface of the bowl at an angle remote from
the fixation point and moved towards the patient's central
vision adjacent the point of patient fixation with the patient
depressing an indicator when the projected light is observed.In both kinds of perimetry, the location of the spot
on the interior projection surface of the instrument must be
precisely identified with respect to the solid angle of patient
vision with respect to the point of fixation at the time the
patient indicates observation of the light. Only when the
correlation is precisely made can a definitive and repeatable
perimetric examination be made.In the past, large
