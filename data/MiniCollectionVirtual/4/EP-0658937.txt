<ABSTRACT>
A 3-D integrated circuit (IC) chip stack employs a 
plurality of discrete chip carriers (56,58) that are formed from 

dielectric tape layers such as fused low temperature co-fired 
ceramic (LTCC) tape. The chips (54) are lodged in cavities 

within the tape layers, and are either flip-chip or 
wire bond connected to electrical routings (70) that extend 

along one or more tape layers toward the periphery of the 
carrier. Intercarrier interconnects are provided between 

the routings for adjacent carriers, either through the carrier 
side walls or externally. The carriers are mechanically 

secured to each other within the stack either by connectors 
that also provide an I/O signal capability, or by 

an adhesive if external electrical connectors are used. 
The structure is strong, compact, inexpensive, compatible 

with conventional IC chips and capable of disassembly and 
reassembly to replace a bad chip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multi-chip module 
(MCM) circuit packages fabricated with dielectric tapes 
such as low temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) tape, and 
more specifically to such circuit structures that are assembled 
in a three-dimensional stack. MCM packages generally include a dielectric structure 
consisting of a number of layers of insulating material 
with electrical circuit elements such as resistors, inductors 
and capacitor plates formed on their surfaces, and conductive 
routing patterns interconnecting the various elements. 
The insulating layers are thermally fused together 
so that the circuit elements are buried, with vertical interconnects 
(vias) extending through the insulating layers 
to interconnect circuit elements on adjacent layers. One or more IC chips and/or discrete components are 
mounted to the surface of the dielectric structure and connected 
to its routing by wire bond, flip-chip or other connection 
techniques. In a flip-chip configuration, a surface 
of an IC chip upon which bonding pads are formed faces 
the dielectric structure, and the bonding pads are connected 
to mating bonding pads on the structure by electrically 
conductive "bumps" formed from solder, conductive epoxy or  
 
other suitable material. LTCC tape is a desirable material for fabricating MCM 
structures. This tape includes a mixture of glass and ceramic 
fillers or recrystallizable glass which sinters at 
about 850°C, and exhibits a thermal expansion similar to 
alumina. The low-temperature processing is compatible with 
air fired resistors and precious metal thick film conductors 
such as gold, silver or their alloys. It also allows 
for the processing of base metals such as copper in a nitrogen 
or reducing atmosphere. A general treatise on LTCC 
technology is provided in Vitriol et al., "Development of 
a Low Temperature Cofired Multi-layer Ceramic Technology", 
ISHM Proceedings, 1983, pages 593-598. An example of an 
LTCC circuit package is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,899, 
118 to Polinski, Sr., assigned to Hughes Aircraft Company, 
the assignee of the present invention. A limitation of the present LTCC MCM technology is in 
the area occupied by the plural IC chips. It would be 
highly desirable to be able to reduce the area requirements 
for individual chips, and thus free up real estate for additional 
circuitry. One approach to reducing the area required per chip 
has been to stack multiple chips vertically in a 3-D arrangement. 
An example of this approach is the DPS1MS8A3 
CMOS
