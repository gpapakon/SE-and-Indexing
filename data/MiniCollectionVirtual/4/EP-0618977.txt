<DESCRIPTION>
 EXPRESSION-SECRETION VECTORS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE FV FRAGMENTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The Fv fragment is the smallest complete antigen binding site presently known. This fragment is composed of only the variable domains of the immunoglobulin variable heavy (V„) and variable light (V.) chains. The small size of the Fv fragment has generated a great deal of interest in the antibody and protein engineering fields because of its potential application in imaging, therapeutics, and structural studies. Initial attempts to generate Fv were made using proteolytic cleavage of whole antibody. However, this technique was hindered by difficulties in controlling both quality and yield (Inbar et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 9, 2659 [1972]). Recombinant DNA techniques were later employed in attempts to express native Fv in bacterial cells. Some groups have tried to express the individual V„ and V- chains and reassociate the chains in vi tro . The production of these proteins intra- cellularly resulted in insoluble proteins which had to be denatured and renatured to generate functional antibody. It is not clear what the exposure to denaturants will do to native antibody structure 

 and hence these systems are less than ideal. More recently, the production of soluble native Fv (Skerra and Pluckthun, Science 24 , 1038 [1988]) and other related fragments (Better et al., Science 240, 1041 [1988]) has been reported. However, the yields of native Fv reported in these systems are quite low (0.2 mg/liter of cells) for many practical applications (e.g., isotope labeling for 3-D NMR analysis). It would be useful to have improved expression-secretion systems for the production of biologically active Fv fragments and single chain Fv molecules.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns expression- secretion systems for the production of biologically active Fv fragments and single chain Fv molecules.In particular, the present invention concerns an expression-secretion vector capable of producing a biologically active Fv fragment comprising a DNA sequence encoding the T7 promoter, a DNA sequence encoding the variable domain of an immunoglobulin heavy chain (V„), a DNA sequence encoding the variable domain of an immunoglobulin light chain (V-), and one or more DNA sequences encoding one or more signal peptide sequences. The present invention further concerns a host cell containing an expression-secretion vector capable of producing a biologically active Fv fragment comprising a DNA sequence
