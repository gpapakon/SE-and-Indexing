<ABSTRACT>
In a mail sequencing process for mail sorting systems with rows of stackers, a sorting plan is used for distributing the mail among the stackers, so as to avoid overloading individual stackers. The stackers are thus not emptied during each sorting pass and once a sorting pass is finished, the mail is transferred in the right sequence from the stackers to a conveyor or container arranged opposite to the stackers.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the sorting of items of mail in running sequence in 
several sorting runs in letter distribution installations with rows 

of stack boxes (1), in which 

the sorting of the items of mail into the stack boxes (1) takes 
place according to a sorting plan, according to which every or 

almost every stack box is filled during a sorting run at most to 
its maximum filling capacity, wherein if a stack box (1) is 

filled up this is assigned to an overflow box in which the 
further unstacking is carried out, 
during a sorting run the stack boxes (1) are not emptied, and 
after each conclusion of a sorting run an unloading, which is 
correct in running sequence, of the items of mail from the stack 

boxes (1) is carried out into a conveying equipment (2) arranged 
opposite the stack boxes (1). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that an 
unloading bridge (3) movable along the row of stack boxes (1) is used 

for the unloading into the conveying equipment (2) or the containers 
(4). 
Method according to claims 1 - 2, characterised thereby that the 
containers (4) during the unloading are filled each time to their 

maximum receiving capacity. 
Method according to claims 1 - 3, characterised thereby that a 
signalling visible to an operator is carried out if an unstacking is 

effected in an overflow box. 
Method according to claims 1 - 4, characterised thereby that 
more than one stack box (1) is assigned to a destination. 
Method according to claims 1 - 5, characterised thereby that the 
containers (4) are brought into a conveyor belt (2) for further  

 
processing of the item of mail after unloading has been carried out. 
Method according to claims 1 - 6, characteised thereby that 
containers (4) with movable box bases are used for a direct stacking 

in of the items of mail. 
Process according to claims 1 to 7, characterised thereby that 
in case of a multi-storey arrangement of the stack boxes (1) an 

unloading is carried out onto conveyor belts arranged one above the 
other.
