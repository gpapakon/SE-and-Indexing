<ABSTRACT>
A textile material for use in air bags made by saturating 
a woven fabric with an aqueous dispersion of a polyolefin 

resin, removing the excess liquor and drying the coated 
fabric at a temperature above the melting temperature of 

the polyolefin. The textile material exhibits low air 
permeability and passes the USA FMVSS No. 302 flammability 

test.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fabric useful for 
manufacturing automotive air bags, and in particular to a 
fabric having reduced air permeability as a result of 
application of an aqueous polyolefin dispersion to the 
fabric. Air bags for motor vehicles are installed on the drivers 
side and, increasingly, on the passenger side of motor 
vehicles. It is their purpose to rapidly inflate in case 
of the collision of the vehicle with another object and to 
protect driver and passenger from serious injury. Air bag fabrics have to satisfy a number of very stringent 
specifications that are not easily met. The fabrics must 
have low air permeability, so that upon instantaneous 
inflation they retain air pressure for sufficient time to 
protect the occupant of a vehicle. The fabrics should be 
as lightweight and flexible as possible so that the 
resulting air bags can be folded into a compact 
configuration for installation in the motor vehicle. They 
must not be adversely affected by long-term folded, 
compressed storage under conditions of heat and humidity 
as can be encountered by automobiles parked in the sun.  
 For example, they must not become tacky, since tacky 
fabric surfaces would glue together the folded layers or 
cause the fabric surface to adhere to the air bag 
container thereby inhibiting the rapid and timely 
deployment of the air bag. It is important that the 
fabric retain its air impermeability over its useful life. Additionally, air bag fabrics should not undergo fiber 
weakening reactions by themselves or with chemicals 
associated with the fabric, as, for example, with 
chemicals constituting part of a fabric coating. To 
prevent their rupture during explosive inflation they must 
retain substantially all of their tensile strength. They 
should not, in the presence of heat and moisture, release 
undesirable or noxious gases. They must meet flammability 
and burn rate specifications. For purposes of ease and 
economy of manufacture they should be easily cut in 
manufacturing without fraying. Both the fabric and air 
bags made therefrom should be inexpensive. Today, air bags are generally manufactured from woven 
nylon and polyester filament fabrics. In order to meet 
the specifications for low air permeability, fabrics are 
generally either woven tightly and then thermally shrunken 
and calendared to achieve the specified air 
impermeability, or the fabrics are coated with one of a 
variety of polymeric film forming materials, such as 
neoprene, urethane or acrylic polymers. For example,
