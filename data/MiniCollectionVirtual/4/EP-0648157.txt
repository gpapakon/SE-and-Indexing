<ABSTRACT>
Gas assisted injection moulding of plastic materials offers opportunities for overcoming some of the problems of conventional injection moulding, in some cases for improving the quality of moulded articles, and in others for widening the scope of design of moulded products. This invention comprises a method of improving the control of delivery of gas, normally nitrogen, to the mould tool by more precisely time phasing the pressures required within the gas, and also for controlling the rate of increasing and reducing gas pressures within the mould production time cycle. The invention can be applied to multi cavity moulds and larger complex mouldings which benefit from injecting gas in more than one position. This invention includes the use of linear displacement transducers as alternatives to time controllers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention falls within the scope of plastic injection moulding, and in particular gas
assisted or gas injection moulding.In recent years there have been several developments of methods of injecting a fluid,
normally in gaseous form, into the molten plastic during the injection moulding process
as the plastic enters or after it has entered an injection moulding tool cavity. After
injection into the flow of plastic the gas follows the path of least resistance which is in
the middle of the plastic flow where the plastic is hottest and least viscous, and thereby
forms continuous channels or hollow sections within the plastic moulding.The objectives of assisting the moulding process and/or improving the quality of
mouldings by the injection of gas into the molten plastic flow can include one or more
of the following :-
reduction of weight by replacing plastic material with hollow gas channels.reduction in process cooling time by reducing the wall section of the molten
plastic.reduction in moulded-in stress thereby reducing the tendency for mouldings to
distort after moulding.reduction or elimination of surface sink marks as a result of the internal pressure
exerted by the gas on the plastic. the possibility of combining thick and thin sections within a moulding design
including the inclusion of webs, pillars and other design features which are not
always feasible in conventional injection moulding design.more uniform pressurisation of the moulding as the plastic cools and solidifies
thereby creating a more homogeneous solidification of the plastic.improving the flow path of the plastic into the mould cavity or cavities by the
addition of thicker flow channels within the mouldings which become hollow
sections after the flow of plastic is completed.creating thicker sections such as handles at positions remote from the feed gate
or point of plastic entry into the mould cavity or cavities.For gas assisted moulding to be effective it is necessary to accurately control the
injection of gas into the molten plastic with particular reference to the timing of the gas
injection relative to the timing of the injection of the plastic by the moulding machine
into the mould cavity or cavities. It is necessary to control the pressure within the gas
also in relation to the pressure in the plastic within the mould or at the point at which
the gas is injected into the plastic.In some versions of gas assisted moulding the gas is injected into the moulding machine
nozzle as the plastic passes through the nozzle prior to its

<CLAIMS>
A method of gas assisted injection moulding
comprising the steps of supplying gas to one or more

positions in an injection mould tool during the mould
cycle wherein the mould cycle is divided

into phases, the commencement and finish of each phase
are controlled and the gas pressure during each phase is

separately controlled in order that gas may be injected
into the molten plastic within the mould cavity or

material feed runners under phased pressure control, the
phases comprising the following:-


Phase 1
Commencement of the injection of plastic
into the mould cavity or cavities.
Phase 2
Release of gas to lines connecting the
mould gas injection points to give a

pressure below the pressure of the plastic
at the point of gas injection, thereby

preventing the gas being injected into the
plastic.
Phase 3
Increasing the gas pressure at a variably
controlled rate of increase to a maximum

pressure above the pressure of the plastic
at the point of entry of the gas into the 

plastic, thereby enabling the gas to be
injected into the moulten plastic.
Phase 4
Maintenance of the maximum gas pressure
for a time controlled period during the

completion of the filling of the mould
cavity or cavities with plastic and gas.
Phase 5
Reduction of gas pressure to approximately
atmospheric pressure before opening of the

mould and ejection of the moulded article
or articles.
A method as claimed in claim 1, in which a high
pressure gas vessel of a fixed volume is filled with gas

at a pressure above the maximum pressure required during
the moulding production time cycle at the point of gas

injection to the mould.

pressure vessel is of a sufficient volume to deliver gas

at the maximum pressure required and in volumes
sufficient to fill the moulded articles and pressure

delivery lines without the necessity for further charging
