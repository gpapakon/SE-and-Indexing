<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention is directed toward the 
valve art and, more particularly, to a flap-type valve 
element and method of forming same. The invention is 
especially suited for forming valve flaps for pressure 
relief valves of the type used to relieve air pressure in 
vehicle passenger compartments. Flap-type valves are commonly used as pressure 
relief valves in motor vehicle passenger compartments to 
maintain the compartments at ambient air pressure and to 
relieve air pressure build-up which results during 
operation of intake vent fans, door closing, and the like. 
To assure proper flexing and adequate sealing, the flap 
valve elements have generally been formed from soft 
elastomeric or rubbery material such as polyvinyl chloride, 
polyethylene, or the like. Often, such flap elements 
exhibit a tendency to warp on initial use and to further 
warp or deform after long term normal use. The subject invention provides a structure and 
method of forming the same which results in a flap valve 
element that is flatter and resists deformation better than 
the typical prior art element. The design is such that 
installation and use are simplified and the need for 
mounting plates and associated structure is reduced or 
eliminated. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, 
there is provided a valve element for use in a flap-type 
pressure relief valve which comprises a first sheet of a 
relatively soft, flexible, elastomeric material having  
 
opposed first and second faces and a peripheral edge 
including a spaced pair of first and second lateral side 
edges. The first face is smooth and planar, and is adapted 
to function as a sealing face. A first strip of relatively 
rigid plastics material is bonded to the second face to 
extend continuously along and closely adjacent the first 
lateral side edge to provide a rigid mounting strip for 
joining the valve element to an associated valve body. 
Preferably, there is a second strip of relatively rigid 
plastics material bonded to the second face at a location 
closely adjacent the first strip to extend along the first 
strip with a gap between the first and second strips 
providing a hinge to allow relative pivoting movement 
therebetween. The first strip of relatively rigid plastics 
material can be provided with fastener receiving openings. 
It assures a proper rigid mounting of the valve element to 
the associated valve body or frame structure. The presence 
of the second rigid strip on the first soft, flexible sheet 
prevents the valve element

A valve element for use in a flap-type 
pressure relief valve comprising: 

   a first sheet of a relatively soft flexible 
elastomeric material having opposed first and second faces 

and a peripheral edge including spaced first and second 
lateral side edges, the first face being smooth and planar 

and adapted to function as a sealing face; and, 
   a first strip of relatively rigid plastics 

material bonded to the second face to extend continuously 
along and closely adjacent the first lateral side edge to 

provide a rigid mounting strip for joining the valve 
element to an associated valve body. 
A valve element as defined in claim 1 
wherein there is a second strip of relatively rigid 

plastics material bonded to the second face at a location 
closely adjacent the first strip to extend along the first 

strip with a gap between the first and second strips 
providing a hinge to allow relative pivoting movement 

therebetween. 
The valve element as defined in claim 2 
wherein the second strip substantially completely covers 

all portions of the second face of the first sheet that are 
not covered by the first strip. 
The valve element as defined in claim 2 
wherein the first strip and the second strip each have a 

straight edge that extend in parallel to one another and 
define the said gap. 
The valve element as defined in claim 4 
wherein the first sheet is generally rectangular in shape 

 
and wherein the first and second strips extend 

longitudinally thereof. 
The valve element as defined in claim 5 
wherein the second strip covers the first sheet from the 

gap to the second lateral side edge. 
The valve element as defined in claim 6 
wherein the first sheet is of uniform thickness. 
The valve element as defined in claim 6 
wherein the second strip is of uniform thickness. 
The valve element as defined in claim 6 
wherein the first and second strips are of uniform 

thickness. 
In a pressure relief valve of the type 
comprising a valve body with an opening therethrough and a 

flap valve element mounted to extend over the opening, the

first imperforate sheet of a relatively soft elastomeric 
material having opposed first and second faces and a 

peripheral edge including first and second spaced lateral 
side edges, a relatively narrow strip of rigid plastic 

bonded to the second face to extend along the first lateral 
side edge with fasteners extending through the strip into 

the valve body to join the flap valve element to the valve 
body with the first face of the first sheet engaging the 

valve body about the opening, and a second strip of

face of the first sheet at a location closely adjacent the 
first strip and extending from the first strip to the 

second lateral edge.

b) simultaneously with the extruding of 
step (a) extruding on to the second face of the first sheet 

along the first lateral side edge a continuous first strip 
of a relatively rigid plastics material to bond to the 

first sheet, the first strip being extruded parallel to the 
first lateral side edge and being of a width "w," which is 

significantly less than one-half "w"; and,
