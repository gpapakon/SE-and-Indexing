<ABSTRACT>
A distortion limiter for limiting the amount of 
distortion of an inverting amplifier (110) is disclosed. A 

comparator (108) produces a pulse when a signal level at an 
inverting input of the inverting amplifier exceeds a 

reference voltage level. The pulse charges a 
capacitor (C1). When the charge on the capacitor is 

sufficient to raise the gate voltage of a junction field-effect 
transistor Q1 above cutoff, the Q1 shunts the input 

signal to reduce its level. The distortion characteristics 
can be controlled by using a voltage divider to adjust the 

voltage across the Q1. A bias voltage at the gate of the 
Q1, keeps the Q1 turned off when the inverting amplifier is 

not clipping.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to audio 
amplifiers, and more specifically to a distortion limiter to 
minimize amplifier clipping. Typical audio reproduction systems include a variable-gain 
preamplification stage, followed by a fixed-gain power 
amplifier. The power amplifier drives an output transducer 
such as a speaker. A volume control voltage, provided to 
the preamplification stage, controls the signal level 
provided to the power amplifier stage and thus controls the 
output volume. One objective in designing audio systems such as the 
one described above is to introduce a minimum amount of 
distortion into the audio signal. Typically, as the 
magnitude of the signal provided from the variable-gain 
preamplification stage to the power amplifier increases 
above a certain level, the power amplifier may be 
overdriven. This occurs when the input signal to the power 
amplifier, multiplied by the fixed gain of the power 
amplifier, approaches the supply voltage provided to the 
power amplifier. At these high input signal levels, the 
power amplifier saturates and the signal peaks of the audio 
signal are distorted. This phenomenon is known as clipping. In some applications, such as portable systems or 
automotive audio systems, the problem of clipping is more 
severe. This is because these systems have a limited 
electrical supply voltage (e.g. the 12-volt automotive 
system) which results in limited voltage headroom provided 
to the amplifier. Many conventional distortion limiters use a feedback 
loop to limit the level of the input signal. In one system, 
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,048,573, to Evans, et al. 
(referred to as '573), a difference amplifier 30 is used to 
amplify the difference in signal level between input and 
output signals of a power amplifier 20. The output signal 
of power amplifier 20 is provided to difference amplifier 30 
via a feedback circuit 25. The output signal of difference  
 
amplifier 20 is fed to a full wave rectifier 32, the output 
of which drives an attenuator 31. When an excess signal is 
input to power amplifier 20 causing clipping, differential 
amplifier 30 outputs a signal in accordance with the 
difference between the amplifier input signal and the 
amplifier output signal. This difference results in an 
attenuation of the input signal by way of rectifier 32 and 
attenuator 31. Another disadvantage with the '573 reference is that 
the feedback signal is provided to a light-emitting diode to 
control the amount of signal shunted to ground via a
