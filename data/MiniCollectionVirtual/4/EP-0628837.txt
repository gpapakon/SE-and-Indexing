<ABSTRACT>
A method and device for determining the location of a target (C) observed in the field of view of an optical detector. The invention is noteworthy in that:   - in a preliminary stage, at least one partial image (9, 10) of the background and one partial image (11) of the target (C) is determined; and   - subsequently:     . an exposure (V1) is taken; . at least one search window (19) of the background is isolated from the said exposure (V1); . the partial image (9) of the background in the said search window (19) is sought; . from the position of this partial image (9), the movement of the optical detector is determined;   . a search window (26) of the target is isolated; . the partial image (11) of the target is sought in the said search window (26); and . from the position of this partial image (11), the movement of the target (C) is determined.

Process for determining the location of a target 
(C) observed in the field of view of an optical detector 

(2), characterized in that: 

in a preliminary step, a picture (V0) is taken of 
the field of view of the optical detector (2) and there 

are determined a model of the background including at 
least one partial image (9, 10) of the background and a 

model of the target including a partial image (11) of the 
target, as well as kinematic characteristics of the 

latter; and 
throughout the duration of determination of 
location, the following steps are repeated: 


a current picture (V1) is taken of the field of 
view; 
at least one background search window (19) is 
isolated from the said current picture (V1); 
the partial image (9) of the background is 
searched for in the said isolated search window (19); 
the movement (D1) of the optical detector (2) 
between the preceding picture and the said current 

picture is determined from the position of this partial 
image (9) in the said search window (19); 
a target search window (26) is isolated from 
the current picture (V1), while taking account of the 

calculated movement of the optical detector and the 
position of the target in the preceding picture; 
the partial image (11) of the target (C) is 
searched for in the said isolated search window (26); 
the movement (D2) of the target (C) with 
respect to the background is determined from the position 

of this partial image (11) in the said search window 
(26); 
the said calculated movement (D2) of the target 
(C) is compared with two values, minimum and maximum, of 

movement which are determined from the kinematic characteristics 
of the target (C), in such a way that if the 

calculated movement (D2) is between the said two values 
the location of the target (C) obtained through this  

 
calculated movement (D2) is confirmed, otherwise an 

estimated position of the target is determined from the 
kinematic characteristics of the latter; and 
the models of the background and of the target 
are conditionally updated. 
Process according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that the models of the background and of 

the target include statistical values of specified 
parameters for the said background and for the said 

target. 
Process according to either of Claims 1 or 2,
 
characterized in that the partial image (11) of the 

target (C) is restricted to a characteristic motif of the 
latter. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that the partial image (9, 10) of the 

background is restricted to a characteristic motif of the 
said background. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in that the background search window is 

determined in such a way that the partial image of the 
background is centred in the said window. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized in that the target search window is determined 

in such a way that the partial image of the target 
is centred in the said window. 
Device (1) for the implementation of the process 
specified in one of claims 1 to 6,
 
characterized in that it includes: 


picture-taking means (3) for taking a picture (V0, 
V1) of the field of view of the optical detector (2); 
an image extraction device (7) for isolating at 
least one partial image (9, 10) of the background and one 

partial image (11) of the target, as well as a background 
search window (19) and a target search window (26); 
a data memory (6) for recording the partial 
images of the background and of the target, as well as 

the characteristic values of specified parameters for the 
background and for the target;  

 
a device for matching (20), receiving the information 
from the data memory (6) and from the image 

extraction device (7) and searching for the partial image 
(9) of the background and the partial image (11) of the 

target in the matching search windows (19, 26); 
a first calculator (23) associated with the said 
matching device (20), calculating the movement (D1) of 

the optical detector (2) and the movement (D2) of the 
target (C); 
a system (27) for confirming the location of the 
target, comparing the calculated movement (D2) of the 

target (C) with movement values determined from kinematic 
characteristics of the target (C), for determining an 

estimation of the position of the target (C); and 
a second calculator (29), allowing the updating 
of the models of the background and of the target.
