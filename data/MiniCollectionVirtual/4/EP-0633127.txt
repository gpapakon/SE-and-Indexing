<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of making flexible film 
pouches having fitment tubes attached thereto. The process includes a single 

operation for the simultaneous sealing of 
the pouch edge seams (11) and the 

fitment tubes (12) to the pouch. An apparatus 
for producing pouches with fitment 

tubes sealed thereto as well as the pouches so produced is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for sealing flexible
films, and for attaching fitment tubes thereto, to make pouches suitable for the
packaging of medical solutions, and also suitable for use as ostomy pouches or
bags. In particular, the present invention relates to a one step method and an
apparatus for attaching fitment tubes to, and sealing flexible films in the form
of pouches that retain their clarity after filling and for heat sterilization.Currently, it is common medical practice to supply liquids such as
medical solutions for parenteral administration in disposable, flexible
pouches. These pouches should be characterized by collapsibility,
transparency, and adequate mechanical strength. They must also be able to
resist the relatively high temperatures required for heat sterilization of their
contents. for example in an autoclave. Typically, medical solutions and the
like are autoclaved at about 123°C (253° F), for periods of 15 to 30 minutes.Commonly, such flexible pouches are typically made from a highly
plasticized polyvinyl chloride. While meeting the requirements mentioned
above, polyvinyl chloride may have some undesirable properties for use as a
medical solution pouch because of the possibility of migration of plasticizer
from the polyvinyl chloride into the medical solution or the other contents of
the pouch so that the solution may become contaminated by potentially toxic
material. A question has also arisen concerning whether PVC is adequately
chemically neutral to medical solutions. It has also been found that polyvinyl
chloride becomes brittle at relatively low temperatures. In these flexible pouches it is desirable to include means for accessing
the container (hereinafter "fitments"). Fitments provide a means for
establishing fluid communication between the container and the outside
environmentFlexible pouches with fitments can be produced by form, fill and seal
packaging machines. Form, fill and seal packaging machines provide an
apparatus for forming a web of film into a flexible container housing a desired
product. Typically, these machines include a former or mandrel. a fill tube,
and heat sealers. The former or mandrel forms or folds the web of film into a
tubular shape around a fill or film tube. The film tube is utilized to dispense
the material to be packaged into the tubular shaped web of film. In these
typical form, fill and seal packaging machines, fitments are attached with an
impulse heat sealing system. Typical apparatus of this type is disclosed, for

A method of making flexible film pouches (30) having fitment tubes (33)
attached thereto comprising the steps of:


a) introducing a web of flexible film (21) into an open film sealing
means (22) for forming the peripheral seams (31) defining at least one

pouch;
b) introducing at least one fitment tube, mounted on fitment tube
sealing means (13) between the layers of the web of flexible film

within the open film sealing means;
c) closing the film sealing means;
d) forming the peripheral pouch seals and sealing the at least one fitment tube
in the thus formed pouch

in a single sealing operating
using RF energy sealing, whereby

a single RF energy source is used which is connected 90 degrees
out of phase between the film sealing means and the fitment tube

sealing means;
e) introducing said pouch to a cutting means and contouring the
pouch and removing it from the web of flexible film.
The method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein, at least two fitment tubes
are sealed to each pouch.
The method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 wherein, a plurality of pouches
having fitment tubes sealed thereto are produced simultaneously.
The method as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein, fitments are attached to said
fitment tubes before said pouches with said fitment tubes are produced.
The method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein, said flexible film sealing
means and said fitment tube sealing means have a temperature of from

about 121°C (250° F) to about 260°C (500° F), preferably about 177°C (350° F). 
The method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein said flexible film sealing
means seal the film web together and the fitment tubes to the film web

at from about 1.4 MPa (200 psi) to about 2.8 MPa (400 psi), preferably about 1.9 MPa (275 psi).
The method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 6 wherein, said cutting means is a die
cutting means.
The method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 7 wherein, said cutting means is a steel
rule cutting means.
The method as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 8 wherein, said RF system operates at a
frequency of from about 27 Megahertz to about 40 Megahertz.
An apparatus for forming flexible film pouches (30) having fitment tubes (33)
sealed therin comprising:


(a) a pouch sealing means (22) comprising: a pair of RF energy heated
dies (10), each die comprising a RF and thermally conductive body

having a RF heating means; and a sealing area, having fitment
tube locating channels therein; and
(b) at least one fitment tube sealing means (13) comprising: a RF energy
heated and thermally conductive body shaped to have a

fitment tube placed on it and being connected 90 degrees out of
phase to the same RF heating means connected to said dies.
The apparatus as claimed in Claim 10 wherein, each of the pouch
sealing means and the fitment tube sealing means are further

characterized as having a release coating covering the sealing areas.
The apparatus as claimed in Claim 10 or 11, wherein, the composition of said
pouch sealing means and said fitment tube sealing means is selected
