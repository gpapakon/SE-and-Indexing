<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ferroelectric liquid
crystal ("FLC") device and a liquid crystal apparatus
containing the same. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a FLC device structure which prevents a
reduction in contrast due to fluctuations of liquid crystal
molecules.Clark and Lagerwall have proposed a display device in
which the property of anisotropic refractive index of the
ferroelectric liquid crystal is advantageously used with a
polarizing element to control light transmission (U. S. Pat.
No. 4,367,924). In general, ferroelectric liquid crystals
have a non-helical structure in a chiral smectic C phase
(SmC*) or H phase (SmH*) in a specific temperature range.
Such a ferroelectric liquid crystal can be in either a first
stable optical state or second stable optical state 
depending on an applied electric field, which will be
maintained even if the applied electric field is removed.
This property is called "bistability". Furthermore,
ferroelectric liquid crystals can respond quickly to a
change in the electric field. Therefore, ferroelectric
liquid crystals are expected to be used in a variety of
high-speed and/or storage-type display devices. Their
properties especially allow them to be used in
high-resolution and large-size display devices. Japanese
Laid-Open Patent No. 03-252624, discloses a technique to
achieve high contrast and high-speed operation in a
large-size high-resolution display using a chiral smectic
ferroelectric liquid crystal.First, methods of achieving high contrast will be
discussed. In general, the transmittance (I/I0) of a liquid
crystal using the property of birefringence under the
crossed-Nicol condition is given by
I/I0 = sin4asin2(Δn d/λ)π
where I0 is the intensity of incident light, I0 is the
intensity of transmitted light, a is an apparent tilt angle,
Δn is anisotropy in refractive index, d is the thickness of
a liquid crystal layer, and λ is the wavelength of incident
light. It can be seen from the above equation that it is
preferable to employ 22.5° as the apparent tilt angle a
(described later in detail) to obtain a high transmittance, 
thereby achieving improved display quality.In the case of a liquid crystal oriented in a
non-helical structure as described above and as utilized
herein, the "apparent tilt angle" a is given by an angle
between the average molecular axis of liquid crystal
molecules in the first orientation state and the average
molecular axis of liquid crystal molecules in the second
orientation state.However, in a
