. The gate insulating film of access 
transistor (Q

) is formed of a single layer of silicon 
oxide film (27c), while the gate insulating film of driver 

transistor (Q
1
, Q
2
) is formed of a stacked layer formed of 
a silicon oxide film (27a) and a silicon nitride film 

(27b). The pair of load transistors (Q

two layers of polycrystalline silicon layers (41, 42) 

stacked upon each other with an insulating film 
therebetween. A source region (41b, 42b) and a drain 

region (41a, 42a) are formed in each of polycrystalline 
silicon layers (41, 42) with each channel region (41c, 

42c) therebetween. One drain region (41a) forms a gate 
opposite to the other channel region (42c), while the 

other drain region (42a) forms a gate opposite to the one

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
semiconductor memory device and to a manufacturing method thereof.Conventionally, SRAM is known as one kind of
semiconductor memory device. Fig. 18 is an equivalent
circuit diagram showing one memory cell of a conventional
SRAM. Referring to Fig. 18, the memory cell uses a p type
MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) as a load, and is formed
of six transistors. More specifically, a pair of driver
transistors (for driving) Q1 and Q2 (n type MOS
transistors) and a pair of load transistors Q5 and Q6 (p
type MOS transistors) are connected with each other to
constitute a flip-flop circuit.The source regions 110 and 111 of the pair of load
transistors Q5 and Q6 are connected to a power supply Vcc.
The source regions of driver transistors Q1 and Q2 are
connected to GNDs 112 and 113. A pair of access transistors Q3 and Q4 (n type MOS
transistors) are connected to storage nodes 114 and 115,
respectively. A bit line 107 is connected to one of the
source/drain regions of access transistor Q3. A bit line
108 is connected to one of the source/drain regions of
access transistor Q4. The gate electrodes of access
transistors Q3 and Q4 are connected to a word line 109.Now, a conventional SRAM memory cell structure will
be described by way of illustrating a document
(International Electron Device Meeting 1991 Technical
Digest pp. 481 - 484).Figs. 19A and 19B are plan views showing a
conventional SRAM memory cell structure divided into two
stages from the bottom layer. More specifically, Fig. 19A
illustrates driver transistors Q1 and Q2 and access
transistors Q3 and Q4 formed on a substrate, while Fig. 19B
illustrates thin film transistors (TFT) Q5 and Q6. Fig. 20
is a schematic sectional view taken along line G-G in
Figs. 19A and 19B.Referring to Figs. 19A, 19B, and 20, in the
conventional memory cell, a pair of driver transistors Q1
and Q2 and a pair of access transistor Q3 and Q4 are formed
at a main surface of a p type well 120. Driver transistor
Q1 has a drain region 125a and a source region 125b
opposing to each other with a channel region 125c 
therebetween, and a gate electrode 124. Driver transistor
Q2 has a drain region 126a and a source region 126b
opposing to each other with a channel region 126c
therebetween, and a gate electrode 123.Access transistor Q3 has a pair of source/drain
regions 125d opposing to each other with a channel region
125e therebetween, and a gate electrode 121. Access
transistor Q4 has a pair of source/drain regions 126d
opposing to each other with a channel
