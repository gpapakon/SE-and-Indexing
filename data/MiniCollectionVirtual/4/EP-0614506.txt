<ABSTRACT>
There is described a downhole stabiliser (10) for use in a drill string adjacent the drill bit. The stabiliser (10) includes a hollow and generally cylindrical casing (12) the outer surface of which defines three angularly spaced protrusions (24, 26, 28), the radially outer surfaces of which define a diameter which is marginally less than the diameter of the bore to be drilled. Two of the protrusions (24, 26) carry radially extensible and retractable spacer members (42-52) which are interconnected so that radially outward movement of one member (42-46) results in radially inward movement of the other member (48-52) and vice versa, effectively to vary the radial length of the respective protrusions. A control mandrel (56) is mounted within the casing (12) and is selectively movable between first and second positions. The control mandrel (56) further defines abutments (58, 60) for limiting the inward movement of the space members (42-52) and in the first position the mandrel permitting a greater degree of travel of one spacer member (42-46) than the other (48-52), and in a second position providing the opposite. The arrangement is such that, in use, the stabiliser (10) with the mandrel (56) in its first position causes the drill bit to veer laterally about a generally vertical axis in a first direction and with the mandrel in its second position the drill bit is caused to veer laterally in the opposite direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DO NHOLE STABILISERThis invention relates to a drilling tool, and in particular to a downhole stabiliser for use in a drill string during directional drilling. The invention also relates to a method of directional drilling.Boreholes, particularly gas and oil bores, are often drilled to extend downwardly and upwardly; this permits bores to, for example, fan outwardly over a wide area from a single, central drilling location and this arrangement is frequently utilised in offshore drilling operations. The drilling of such inclined bores is achieved through use of drilling tools generally known as stabilisers mounted on the drill string comparatively near the drill bit, such as described in European Patent Specification No. EP-A-0 251 543.Conventional directional drilling techniques utilise stabilisers of different diameters or stabilisers with variable effective diameters: a maximum diameter equal to the bore will tend to centralise the drill string in a bore which maintains the straightness of the well being drilled, and a lesser diameter will allow at least part of the drill string to bow downwardly under its own weight and thus create an upward curvature of the well.It is an object of the present invention to provide a drilling tool which further permits bores to be drilled in a desired lateral direction in addition to the choice of upward inclinations available using conventional stabilisers.According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a downhole stabiliser for use in a drill string adjacent the drill bit, the stabiliser comprising a hollow and generally cylindrical casing the outer surface of which defines first, second and third angularly spaced protrusions the radially outer surfaces of which 

 define a diameter which is marginally less than the diameter of the bore to be drilled, said first and second protrusions carrying radially extensible and retractable spacer members which are interconnected so that radially outward movement of one member results in radially inward movement of the other member and vice versa, effectively to vary the radial length of the respective protrusions, and- a control mandrel mounted within the casing and selectively movable between first and second positions, the control mandrel defining abutment means for limiting the inward movement of the spacer members, in the first position the mandrel permitting a greater degree of travel of one spacer member than the other, and in a second position the mandrel providing the opposite.The arrangement is

CLAIMS
1. A downhole stabiliser for use in a drill string adjacent the drill bit, the stabiliser comprising: a hollow and generally cylindrical casing (12) the outer surface of which defines first, second and third angularly spaced protrusions (24, 26, 28) the radially outer surfaces of which define a diameter which is marginally less than the diameter of the bore to be drilled; said first and second protrusions (24, 26) each carrying radially extensible and retractable spacer members (42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52) which are interconnected so that radially outward movement of one member (42, 44, 46) results in radially inward movement of the other member (48, 50, 52) and vice versa, effectively to vary the radial length of the respective protrusions (24, 26) ; and a control mandrel (56) mounted within the casing (12) and selectively movable between first and second positions (Figure 1; Figure 6) , the control mandrel (56) defining abutment means (58, 60) for limiting the inward movement of the spacer members (42 - 52) , in the first position the mandrel (56) permitting a greater degree of travel of one spacer (42 - 46) member than the other (48 - 52) , and in the second position the mandrel providing the opposite.
2. The stabiliser of claim 1, in which the spacer members are in the form of pistons (42 - 52) each located in a bore in a respective protrusion (24, 26) .
3. The stabiliser of claim 1 or claim 2, in which the third protrusion (28) is of fixed radial length.
4. The stabiliser of claim 1, 2 or 3 further including 


 lock means for holding the control mandrel (56) in the respective positions.
5. The stabiliser of claim 4, in which the lock means includes a radially moveable locking piston (64) mounted in the third protrusion (28) for locking the control mandrel (56) in said first position.
6. The stabiliser of claim 5, in which the lock means includes a pressure responsive area (70) on the control mandrel (56) , for responding to fluid pressure in the drill string, pressure applied to said area (70) tending to move the mandrel (56) to the second position, .
7. The stabiliser of claim 6 in which a spring (68) is provided between the casing (12) and the control mandrel (56) and biases the mandrel (56) towards the first position.
8. The stabiliser of claim 6 or 7, in which said pressure responsive area is in the form of a restricted cross-section passage (70) in the mandrel (56) .
9. The stabiliser of claim 7 or 8 in which the locking piston (64) is moveable from a locking position, for engagement with the control mandrel (56) , to an unlocked position by centrifugal force, by rotating the stabiliser.
10. The stabiliser of any one of the preceding claims, in which the protrusions (24, 26, 28) are angularly spaced by between 90° and 180°.
