<ABSTRACT>
The pack proposed is designed for pills which are to be taken in prescribed cycles, each individual pill being taken at a specified time which is displayed on the pack. The pack has a container designed in the form of a sleeve with a longitudinal slot (2) or a slot-shaped window. The container is surrounded by, or surrounds, a second sleeve (3) with calenders indicating the days of the week. The calenders are disposed vertically one beside the other in a continuous series of seven round the sleeve (3). The sleeve can be physically locked in seven rotational positions such that in each of the selectable positions a calender starting with a different day of the week lies over the slot (2) or window or is covered by the slot (2) or window. A sleeve-shaped pill-holder can be inserted into the container and locked in place. The pills are ejected by a pill-ejection mechanism (11, 12, 13).

<CLAIMS>
A receptacle for holding and individually dispensing pills 
contained in holders, which are to be used in predetermined 

cycles,
 
wherein a sleeve-shaped container (1) has in the axial longitudinal 

direction a slot (2) or a window designed in this form, 
and a sleeve-shaped holder (4) can be introduced into the container 

(1) and be secured therein,
 
and an ejection mechanism (11, 12, 13) for pills acts on the 

sleeve-shaped holder (4) inserted in the container (1),
 
characterized in that
 
the container (1) is surrounded by a second sleeve (3) provided 

with weekly calendars or encloses the latter, in which arrangement 
the weekly calendars are successively arranged on the sleeve 

(3) radially side by side in a seven-fold version,
 
the sleeve (3) is in seven positions secured with a form fit 

against radial rotation, so that in each of the adjustable 
positions, a weekly calendar with a different first day of the 

week covers the slot or the window (2), or is overlapped by the 
latter. 
A receptacle according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
sleeve-shaped holder (4) has at least one guide crosspiece (5) 

which can be introduced into a corresponding guide (6) within the 
container (1). 
A receptacle according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the holder (4) has at one end two opposed openings (8, 9) 

serving for the emergence of the pills, in which arrangement the  
 

opening (8), which is kept closed by means of at least one flexible 
tongue (10), serves for the emergence of a pill, and an 

ejector tongue (11) can be introduced into the holder (4) through 
the second opening (9). 
A receptacle according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that a push member (12) is held against the ejection direction of 

the ejector tongue (11) by means of a compression spring (13), 
which is supported inside the container (1), and is connected to 

the ejector tongue (11). 
A receptacle according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the ejector tongue (11), carried in a guide in the container 

(1) for displacement in the axial direction, is flexible at its 
end and can be introduced with this end into the opening (9) in 

the holder (4). 
A receptacle according to claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that on the container (1) and/or the sleeve (3), there are arranged 

catch means which prevent radial rotation with respect to 
each other. 
A receptacle according to claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that on the container (1) and the sleeve (3), at least parts of 

the peripheral surfaces facing each other are designed as heptagons 
and can be pushed into one another. 
A receptacle according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that on the container (1), a rotatable lid (14) with 

an opening (15) is secured on the side of the container (1) 
facing in the opposite direction to the push member (12), which 

lid releases the ejection opening (8) in one position. 
A receptacle according to claim 8, characterized in that the 
lid (14) may be pulled off from the container (1) and be repositioned 

thereon.
