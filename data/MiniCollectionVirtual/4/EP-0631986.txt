<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing α-alumina power constituted 
by α-alumina single crystal particles comprises calcining 

at least one of transition alumina and a transition alumina 
precursor, in a gas atmosphere containing (1) at least 

5% of F, Cl, Br and/or I, (2) at least 1% HF, HBr and/or HI, 
or (3) a component prepared from at least 1%, based on 

the total gas atmosphere, of F gas, Br gas and/or I gas, 
and at least 0.1% of steam. The percentages are by volume 

and based on the total gas atmosphere. 
The α-alumina single crystal particles have high 
purity, homogeneity, a narrow primary particle size distribution 

and an octahedral or higher polyhedral shape. The 
powder can be obtained from alumina raw materials of a 

variety of different kinds in an industrially advantageous 
manner, and is suitable as a raw material for abrasives, 

sintered products, plasma spraying materials, fillers, 
single crystals, supports for catalysts, fluorescent substances, 

encapsulants, ceramic filters and spacers for 
liquid cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing 
α-alumina powder. α-Alumina powder is widely used as a raw material for 
abrasives, sintered products, plasma spraying materials, 
fillers, etc. α-Alumina powder obtained by conventional 
processes which have been generally employed comprises 
irregular-shaped polycrystals, contains many agglomerated 
particles, and has broad particle size distribution. 
Furthermore, the purity of such conventional α-alumina powder 
is insufficient for some uses. In order to overcome these 
disadvantages for some specific uses, α-alumina powder 
produced by special processes as hereinafter described has 
been employed. However, these special processes still 
involve difficulty in producing α-alumina powder with a 
narrow particle size distribution, which comprises 
homogeneous α-alumina particles. Among general processes for producing α-alumina 
powder a Bayer's process is the most economical process. In 
a Bayer's process, bauxite is converted to aluminum 
hydroxide or transition alumina, which is then calcined in 
air to prepare α-alumina powder.  
 The aluminum hydroxide or transition alumina which is 
obtained as an intermediate product on an industrial scale at 
low cost generally comprises agglomerated particles having a 
diameter of greater than 10 µm. α-Alumina powder obtained by 
calcination of such aluminum hydroxide or transition alumina 
in air comprises primary particles, of irregular shape 
containing many coarse particles agglomerated strongly. The 
α-alumina powder containing coarse agglomerated particles is 
ground into final products by means of a ball mill, a 
vibration mill, etc., but grinding is not always easy and 
incurs cost. Further, α-alumina powder having poor 
grindability needs a long grinding time. Consequently too 
fine powder may be formed which is unsuitable, particularly 
as a raw material for abrasives. Several proposals have been made to solve these 
problems. For example, JP-A-59-97528 (the term "JP-A" as 
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application") teaches a process for improving the shape of 
α-alumina powder, which comprises calcining aluminum 
hydroxide prepared by a Bayer's process in the presence of an 
ammonium-containing boron or boron series mineralizer to 
obtain α-alumina powder. In order to remove sodium and to control the particle 
size simultaneously, it has been proposed to carrying out 
calcination of sodium-containing aluminum hydroxide obtained 
by a Bayer's process in the presence of
