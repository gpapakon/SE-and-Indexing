<ABSTRACT>
A system for mounting an airbag and airbag inflator comprises an airbag inflator (10) having a plurality of clips (18) that are engageable with a mounting plate (32). The airbag (30) is interposed between the inflator (10) and the mounting plate (32) when the clips (18) on the inflator are engaged with the mounting plate so as to support the airbag and seal the interface between the inflator and mounting plate. Gas flow incident to deflation of the airbag is vented through the mounting plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The major components of a typical state-of-the-art
inflatable vehicle occupant restraint mechanism are an
inflator, an inflatable airbag, and a mounting plate therefor.
The airbag is generally secured to the inflator and/or mounting
plate by a plurality of rivets and/or threaded fasteners. The
inflator is typically secured to the mounting plate on the
opposite side thereof from the airbag by additional fasteners.
An O-ring or other form of seal is usually positioned between
the inflator and the mounting plate to prevent inflation gases
from escaping during deployment.The aforesaid construction is less than satisfactory
in that it requires multiple rivets and/or threaded fasteners
for both inflator and airbag retention. Moreover, the inflator
and airbag are fastened to the mounting plate in separate
assembly operations. The seal required to prevent high
pressure high temperature inflation gases from escaping into
the vehicle passenger compartment between the mounting plate
and inflator during deployment, thereby reducing airbag
pressure, is a source of system failure. Ultimate venting of
the spent inflation gases is through vents in the bag into the
passenger space. US-A-5.141.247 discloses a system comprising an airbag
inflator having a plurality of gas discharge orifices, to
inflate an airbag; a mounting plate to support the airbag and
the inflator on a vehicle; and a retainer ring, disposed
between the airbag inflator and the airbag, having tabs
bendable for clamping together the airbag, the inflator and
the mounting plate.US-A-5.064.218 discloses a system for mounting an airbag and
airbag inflator having a plurality of gas discharge orifices,
to inflate the airbag; a mounting plate to support the airbag
and the inflator on a vehicle, disposed between the airbag
inflator and the airbag; a retainer ring; wherein snap-fit,
i.e. resilient, fasteners are used in conjunction with rivets
or threaded fasteners to clamp the airbag, mounting plate,
retainer ring and inflator together.The aforesaid problems are solved by the inflator and
airbag mounting system of the present invention which utilizes
snap-in fasteners that achieve fast, simple initial
installation as well as implement subsequent disassembly for
servicing. The periphery of the airbag is sandwiched between
a flange of the inflator and the mounting plate to effect
attachment of the airbag as well as to function as a seal,
thereby eliminating the requirement for a separate O-ring seal.
The inflator and airbag are secured to the mounting plate in a

<CLAIMS>
A system for mounting an airbag and airbag inflator
comprising:


a mounting plate (32);
an airbag inflator (10) comprising a housing (12) having a
gas discharge orifice and a peripheral flange (14);
an airbag (30) having a portion completely covering the
flange (14) on said inflator (10) and an aperture (40)

aligned with the orifice in said inflator; and
a plurality of resilient fasteners (18) secured to said
inflator (10) and extending at substantially a right

angle to the flange (14) thereof, said fasteners (18)
being engageable with said mounting plate (32) with said

airbag (30) being interposed between the flange (14) on
said inflator (10) and said mounting plate (32) thereby

to seal the interface between said inflator flange (14)
and said mounting plate (32).
A mounting system in accordance with claim 1 wherein
said fasteners (18) are integral with a retainer (20) and

said retainer (20) is crimped to the flange (14) of said
inflator (10).
A mounting system in accordance with claim 1 wherein
the flange (14) on said inflator (10) and the aperture (40)

in said airbag are circular.
The system of claim 1 wherein the flange (14) in said
inflator (10) has a plurality of apertures (16) for the

venting of gas from said airbag.
The system of claim 4 wherein said fasteners (18)
extend through the apertures (16) in the flange (14) of said

inflator (10).
