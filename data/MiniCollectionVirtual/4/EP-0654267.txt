<ABSTRACT>
A carcinostatic for a hormonotherapy containing 
dienogest or its solvate, which is expected to exert 

therapeutic effects for a broad range of cancer cases at a 

far lower dose than that of conventional hormonotherapeutic 
agents and utterly free from side effects that the 

conventional high-dose hormonotherapy had suffered.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carcinostatic for a
hormonotherapy containing dienogest or its solvate as an
effective component, a therapeutic agent for a sex hormone-dependent
cancer containing dienogest or its solvate as an
effective component, or a therapeutic agent for uterine
cancer and/or breast cancer, which contains dienogest or
its solvate as an effective component.Dienogest is the International Nonproprietary Names
(INN) of a known compound, (17α-cyanomethyl-17β-hydroxy-estra-4,9(10)-dien-3-one)
having a structure represented by
formula (I) :
The nature and synthesis of this compound are
compactly described in Schubert et al., Elsevier Science
Publishers ed., Natural Products Chemistry, 1984, 143-158. Dienogest is known to have progestational activity,
and in Germany, a combined drug of dienogest with
ethynylestradiol is recently purchased as an oral
contraceptive. Use of the dienogest as a therapeutic agent
for endometriosis has also been attempted (Exp. Clin.
Endocrinol. 94, 1-2, 211, 1989). However, there has so far
been no report indicating the carcinostatic activity of the
dienogest.It has also been reported that dienogest is free from
androgenic activity, which is different from other
compounds with progestational activity (Schubert et al.,
Elsevier Science Publishers ed., Natural Products
Chemistry, 1984, 143-158, supra).One current research theme in the field of cancer and
hormone is "hormone dependency of cancer", and various
researches are made on the influence of biological hormones
on the initiation, promotion and progression of cancer. In
view of such researches, hormonotherapy has become an
important pharmacotherapy in treating typical sex hormone-dependent
cancers such as uterine (endometrial carcinoma)
cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and thyroid gland
cancer.For example, more than 95% of uterine cancer are
adenocarcinoma, and the cells in the uterine cancer lesion
often retain some of the characteristics of epitherial
cells of the endometrium in its proliferative phase. Such
cells are believed to proliferate in the absence of
progesterone by the stimulation of estrogen (Gurpide, J. 
Natl. Cancer Inst., 83, 6, 405-416, 1991). In view of such
reports, hormonotherapies utilizing antiestrogens or
progestins have been attempted as a pharmacotherapy in
addition to conventional chemotherapies for the uterine
cancer.Antiestrogens such as tamoxifen and its derivatives
have been attempted for use in such hormonotherapy. With
regard to such antiestrogens, it has been reported that
