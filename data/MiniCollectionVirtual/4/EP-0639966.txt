<ABSTRACT>
A panty brief is made by flat knitting a front piece (1) and a back piece (1'), in which the leg openings (8, 9) are formed at a marginal edge zone (6) at the bottom of the penty brief. The leg openings may in a simple way obtain such a width that they do not cause local compressive press on a user. Such a great width in the leg openings (8, 9) is obtained by the marginal edge zone (6) being partially made of soluble yarn (8) for forming larger stitches (19, 20) and thereby a looser structure in the marginal edge zone after the dissolution of the yarn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to panty briefs formed by a flat knitted, 
subtantially rectangular front piece and back piece, which are 
made separately, and which by interknitting are connected along marginal 
edge zones in the sides of the panty briefs for forming side 
seams, and along a part of the bottom of the panty briefs for forming 
a crotch region separating two non-connected parts of the marginal 
edge zones at the bottom of the panty briefs for forming leg openings, 
said panty briefs being made with elastic threads, which generally 
extend from one side to the other of the front and back pieces for 
providing a circumferentially elastic contraction in the panty briefs. It is known to make panty briefs by knitting with different forms in 
order to obtain the best possible fit without a need for after-fashioning 
of the panty briefs. Even though several proposals are 
made, the panty briefs for fixation of a napkin will normally require 
a circumferential elasticity in the panty briefs so that an elasticity 
occurs at the leg-bands formed at the marginal edge zone at the bottom 
of the panty briefs, said elasticity at the leg-bands may be irritating 
for the user due to a local compressive press. WO 91/19845 describes panty briefs with front and back pieces being 
connected along other parts of marginal edge zones. Leg openings are 
provided opposite each other at a lower non-connected part of the 
marginal edge zones. In order to obtain a crotch region with some 
elasticity, some embodiments may have a zone having a looser knitting. 
However, the knitting is always provided as closed stitches and this 
is a drawback because it is necessary to control the knitting process 
very accurately and as the knitting must be different depending on 
which part of the panty briefs is being knitted. Panty briefs according to the present invention may be considered as a 
further development of panty briefs, which are described in the United 
States Patent No. 3,656,324. 
Thus materials, knitting types, stitch size, embodiments, 
etc., which are described in the United States Patent, may 
also be used when making the panty briefs according to the present 
invention.  
 It is the object of the present invention to remedy the drawbacks of 
the known panty briefs, especially for fixation of napkins, by providing 
panty briefs of the above-mentioned type, which may be made by 
machines and in endless lengths without a need for after-fashioning, 
and which are provided with leg openings, which do not cause a

<CLAIMS>
Panty briefs formed by a flat knitted, substantially rectangular front piece (1) and 
back piece (1'), which are made separately, and which by interknitting are connected 

along marginal edge zones (2,3) in the sides of the panty briefs for forming side seams 
(4,5), and along a part of the bottom of the panty briefs for forming a crotch region 

separating two non-connected parts of the marginal edge zones at the bottom of the 
panty briefs for forming leg openings (8,9), said panty briefs being made with elastic 

threads, which generally extend from one side (2) to the other (3) of the front and back 
pieces (1,1') for providing a circumferentially elastic contraction in the panty briefs, 


characterized
 in that, in the finished panty briefs, only a part of the stitches being 
formed in the front and back pieces (1,1') of the panty briefs in a marginal edge zone (b) 

at the bottom of the panty briefs when knitting the panty briefs, are closed. 
Panty briefs according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that part of the yarn used 
for forming stitches in said marginal edge zone, is soluble yarn. 
Panty briefs according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the soluble yarn is water-soluble 
yarn. 
Panty briefs according to claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the soluble yarn is 
steam-soluble yarn. 
Panty briefs according to any one of claims 2-4, 
characterized
 in that the 
soluble yarn constitute less than 10 % by weight of the yarn, and preferably of between 

0.5 and 2 % by weight of the yarn, in the marginal edge zone of the panty briefs. 
Panty briefs according to any one of claims 2-5, 
characterized
 in that the 
amount of the soluble yarn per area unit gradually decreases towards the bottom  

 
of the panty briefs so that the loosest structure appears nearest the bottom of the panty 

briefs.  
 
Panty briefs according to any one of claims 2-6, 
characterized
 in that the elastic 
threads in the bottom of the panty briefs are made up of wound yarn forming stitches 

together with the soluble yarn. 
Panty briefs according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that compound needles (30) 
are used at the knitting, which needles in said marginal edge zone (6) are controlled by a 

separate guide bar (31,32, 33,34), which threads some of the needles only so that the 
stitches in this zone are optionally closed or opened. 
Panty briefs according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 in 
that the width of the marginal edge zone having the loose structure is of between 10 and 

25 mm, preferably of between 15 and 25 mm in an unstretched state.
