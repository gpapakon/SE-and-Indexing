<ABSTRACT>
A method of recording compressed and coded data 
comprises the steps of compressing and coding video signals 

for every predetermined number of frames with the amount of 
codes per the group of frames being 

constant; storing the group of frames of 
compressed and coded video signals into at least one video 

packet; storing the video packet in a pack having a time 
slot corresponding to the predetermined number of frames 

(desirably at the end of the pack); and recording the video 
signals on the recording medium in a pack stream containing 

such packs, with the relation between the size of the pack 
and the size of the logical block of the recording medium 

being set to 1 : n (n: an integer) and the relation between 
the size of the pack and the size of the physical block of 

the recording medium being set to 2 : n.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of recording
compressed and coded video signals on a recording medium,
and a method of recording compressed and coded video
signals, audio signals and other data in time-division
multiplexing.As a method of recording, reproducing or transferring
compressed and coded video and audio signals and other data
in time-division multiplexing, there is MPEG (Motion
Picture coding Experts Group) which conforms to ISO 11172.The compressive coding of video signals in this scheme
employs predictive coding in combination with motion
compensation, and discrete cosine transform (DCT).In this conventional method or in a system which
records and reproduces a multiplexed signal consisting of
compressed and coded video and audio signals and various
kinds of data (audio/video/data multiplexed stream) on and
from a predetermined recording medium, the speed and
easiness of random accessing, and the reduction of the
buffer capacity and the facilitation of control and edition
in the reproducing system are not sufficiently
accomplished. It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a method of recording compressed and coded data,
which is advantageous in improving the speed and easiness
of random accessing, and reducing the buffer capacity and
facilitating control and edition in the reproducing system.To achieve the above object, according to this invention, there is provided a
compressed and coded data recording method for
recording video signals on a recording medium in compressed
and coded form, which method comprises the steps of:
compressing and coding video signals for every
predetermined number of frames with an amount of codes per
said predetermined number of frames being constant; the method characterised by storing said predetermined
number of frames of compressed and coded video signals into at
least one video packet;storing said video packet in a pack having a time slot
corresponding to said predetermined number of frames; andrecording said video signals on said recording medium
in a pack stream containing such packs, with a relation
between a size of said pack and a size of a logical block
of said recording medium being set to n : 1 (where n is an
integer) and a relation between said size of said pack and a
size of a physical block of said recording medium being set to
m : 2 (where m is an integer also).According to this method, the correlations between a
predetermined number of frames of video signals to be
recorded and the sizes of the logical block and
