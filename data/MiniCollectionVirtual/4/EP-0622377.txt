<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an isolated 
nucleic acid fragment comprising a nucleic acid sequence 

coding for an amphotropic retrovirus receptor. 
This receptor is referred to as GLVR2 and has approximately 

62% homology with the GLVR1 gene encoding for 

Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus (GALV). Differences for the 
type of retroviruses interacting with the receptors 

exist. The protein encoding by the GLVR2 gene, cells 
transformed or transfected by the gene and vectors containing 

the gene are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Following the discovery of human immunodeficiency 
virus and human T-cell leukemia virus, the study of 
unrecognized frequent infection of humans and other 
mammals by retroviruses has been more actively studied. 
Of particular interest is the study of how retroviruses 
achieve infection. It is generally understood that the 
initial stage of infection requires an interaction 
between a glycoprotein of the retrovirus envelope and a 
receptor on the surface of the intended host's cells. 
It is known that different retroviruses utilize different 
receptors in infecting host cells, and the absence 
of the appropriate retroviral receptor on the cell of a 
particular species will prevent infection by that 
retrovirus. Interference studies indicate that there 
are probably no more than eight different retrovirus 
receptors for retroviruses known to infect human cells 
(Sommerfelt and Weiss, Virology, 176:58-69, 1990). 
Many retroviruses can infect human cells invitro, but 
the role of such viruses in causing disease, if any, 
has yet to be elucidated. The study of the retrovirus 
life cycle is hampered by a lack of knowledge of the 
identity and structure of the various retroviral 
receptors, and the extent of their expression in human 
and other potential host cells. One recently identified receptor is that for 
Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus (GALV; U.S. Patent  
 
No. 5,151,361). GALV is known to cause myeloid leukemias 
in gibbons, and has been isolated from animals 
with lymphosarcoma and granulocyte leukemia (Kawakamira 
and Buckley, Transplant Proc., 6:193-196, 1984; Kawakami 
etal., Nature (London) New Biol., 235:170-171, 
1972, Kawakami etal., Int. J. Cancer, 25:841-846, 
1980). Although there is no known disease caused by 
this virus in humans, its receptor (GLVR1) is expressed 
in human cells. In addition to acting as the receptor 
for GALV, this receptor is also utilized by another 
retrovirus, Feline Leukemia Virus-B (FeLV-B). It has now been unexpectedly determined that a 
gene highly homologous, but not identical, to the GALV 
receptor exists. This gene is designated as GLVR2. 
Most surprisingly, however, the gene is determined to 
encode yet another functionally distinct retroviral 
receptor, namely the receptor for amphotropic retroviruses. 
Amphotropic retroviruses comprise a distinct 
group of murine viruses with a wide host range. They 
infect most mammalian cells, including human. The present invention provides an isolated nucleic 
acid fragment comprising a nucleic acid sequence 
encoding an
