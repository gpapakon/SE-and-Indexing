<ABSTRACT>
A plastic container, such as a crate, bin or the 
like, comprises a circumferential rim with a receiving space (13) 

for a flexible card (4), such as an identification card with a bar 
code, for example. This receiving space is formed by a 

horizontal U-profile, of which the legs are outwardly oriented 
and the body of which forms the rear wall of the receiving 

space. Over part of the length of the receiving space, slots (12) 
have been formed on the legs of the U-profile for receiving 

the longitudinal rims of the card, and at the ends of the 
receiving space, slots have been provided for receiving the 

end rims of the card. The rear wall of the receiving space is 
provided with a recess into which the card may be pressed. 

After installation of the card, a filling element (14) is pressed 
into the receiving space, so that the card can no longer be 

removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a plastic container, such as 
a crate, bin or the like, comprising a circumferential rim 
with a receiving space for a flexible card, such as an 
identification card with a bar code, for example, said 
receiving space being formed by a horizontal U-profile, of 
which the legs are outwardly oriented and the body of which 
forms the rear wall of the receiving space, wherein, over part 
of the length of the receiving space, slots have been formed 
on the legs of the U-profile for receiving the longitudinal 
rims of the card, and wherein, at the ends of the receiving 
space, slots have been formed for receiving the end rims of 
the card. Such a container is known from the German 
Gebrauchsmuster 93 06 662.7. The corresponding card, which is 
made of plastic provides, for example, data on the contents, 
the manufacturer, the destination, the owner, etc., which 
information may be provided in the form of a bar code or the 
like. Although the card in this known container, as a result 
of the recessed mounting thereof in the receiving space and 
the almost complete enclosure thereof in the slots, can only 
be removed from the receiving space with difficulty, the 
removal of the card is not impossible. This is due to the fact 
that the card, in particular at its end rims, only extends to 
a very limited extent into the corresponding slots. It is not 
possible to increase the length of the card, as it will then 
no longer be possible to fit the end rims of the card into the 
corresponding slots. The invention aims to provide a plastic container of 
the type referred to above, wherein these drawbacks have been 
overcome in a simple way. To this end, the container according to the present 
invention is characterized in that the rear wall of the 
receiving space comprises a recess into which the card can be 
pressed, wherein a filling element is provided which is 
movable between a position in which the filling element is 
situated outside the recess and an operational position in 
which the filling element at least partly fills the recess.  In this way, it is achieved that the card may have 
such a length, that the end rims are completely enclosed in 
the corresponding slots of the receiving space, as a result of 
the fact that, on fitting the card into the receiving space, 
it may be accommodated over part of its length in the recess. The removal of the card after installation thereof is 
entirely ruled out by pressing the filling element, after 
installation of the card, into the recess,
