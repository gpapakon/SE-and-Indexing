<ABSTRACT>
A pilot training device is characterised by a video image generator (12) which is fitted to the pilot's helmet (10) and has a screen (14). The image on the screen (14) can be reflected via a semi-reflective mirror (16) into the pilot's eye. An external load container (24) can be fitted to the aircraft. The external load container (24) contains means for producing scenarios, means for the determination of flight data, and means for recording pilot reactions. The semi-reflective mirror (16) is then fitted to the pilot's helmet (10) such that it is inclined with respect to the pilot's viewing direction. A video camera (22) is furthermore fitted to the pilot's helmet (10), into which video camera the field of view seen by the pilot is reflected, via the outside of the semi-reflective mirror (16).

<CLAIMS>
Pilot training device, comprising

(a) a video image generator (12) attached to the helmet (10) of the pilot and
having a screen (14), the image of which is adapted to be reflected into the

eye of the pilot through a semireflecting mirror (16),
(b) a pod (24) adapted to be attached to the aircraft and having

(b
1
) means for generating scenarios including an image generated by the
video image generator and adapted to be reflected into the eye of the

pilot, and
(b
2
) sensors for determining associated flight data of the aircraft,
characterized in that
(c) as means for recording and evaluation of pilot reactions to the scenarios and
flight data (44) are provided


(c
1
) a neural network (54) having weights, and which is trained in an
initial state for imitation of the behaviour of a generic pilot as reaction

to the scenarios and to flight data represented by sensor signals and to
which the sensor signals and signals representing the reactions of a

real human pilot are applied in a learning mode during the flight with
reflected images, such that the neural network is "retrained" in a

learning process from the initial state to a state having changed 
weights, in which its behaviour approaches the behaviour of the real

human pilot,
(c
2
) an adaptive knowledge and database (60) having rules, which code the
behaviour of a pilot as a function of the sensor signals in if-when-form

and which are provided with weights, which represents the importance
of the rules for the correct pilot behaviour,
(c
3
) means for applying the sensor signals to the knowledge and database,
and
(c
4
) means for stepwise changing the weights of the knowledge and
database as a function of changes of the weights of the neural network

(56) with respect to the initial state.
Pilot training device as set forth in claim 1, characterized by means for changing
the rules of the knowledge and database (60) as a function of changes of the

weights of the neural network (56) with respect to the initial state.
Pilot training device as set forth in claim 1 or 2, characterized by means (64) for
generating a measure of the flying capability of the pilot from the changed weights

of the rules in the knowledge and database (60).
