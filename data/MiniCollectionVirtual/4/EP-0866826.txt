<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a process and device for the standardised continuous production of polyamides, specifically polyamide 6, polyamide 6.6 and copolyamides from  epsilon -caprolactam and/or adipic-acidic hexamethylenediamine or adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine. The aim is to use a combination and design of specific processes known from the production of individual polyamide types to design a polymerisation reactor in which polymide 6, polyamide 6.6, copolyamides from  epsilon -caprolactam and an aqueous AH salt solution of sufficiently high quality can be produced with the most efficient possible use of the energy applied. The process sequence in the production of polyamide 6, polyamide 6.6 and copolyamide was adapted for a single reactor in such a way that the initial substances can be used alternately in the individual processing stages: pre-heating of the initial products using a common heat exchanger to 190-300  DEG C; polymerisation of the initial products in a pressure stage with or without elimination of water and product recycling at 150-280  DEG C and a pressure of 
<
 20 bar; dewatering of the polymer melt in a one to five turn coil under slow pressure reduction; final condensation of the melt in at least one common vertical reactor at temperatures of between 210 and 285  DEG C.

Method for uniform, continuous production of
polyamides such as polyamide 6, polyamide 6.6 and

copolyamides derived from ε-caprolactam and/or adipic acid
hexamethylene diamine or adipic acid and hexamethylene

diamine, using and combining the various stages from the
respective individual processes relating to the polyamide

types,

characterised in that polyamide 6 or polyamide 6.6 or
copolyamide is alternately produced in a reactor and to

this end the starting substance to be treated, ε-caprolactam,
adipic acid hexamethylene diamine, adipic

acid and hexamethylene diamine alone or in admixture, are
pre-heated and charged into the pressurised reactor and

the polymerisation is undertaken in the pressurised
reactor with variable pressures, temperatures and

residence times in dependence on the type of polyamide; a
pressure of 0.6 to 2.1 MPa is generated by the water

present in the reaction mix and the temperature is
regulated within the range 150 to 280 °C and according to

the requirements concerned a dewatering of the
precondensate of the polyamide types is carried out with

simultaneous recycling of starting products via an added-on
rectifying column and the melt is subsequently post-condensed

in at least one reactor in which an adjustment
of the melt level is undertaken in dependence on the

excess water in the melt, and the excess water contained
in the prepolymer or precondensate is expelled with the

exception of a proportion which remains in the melt to
adjust the final viscosity, and the adjustment of a

polymerisation equilibrium is undertaken in the post-condensation
operation at a pressure of between 0.1 and

0.15 MPa at temperatures within the range 210 to 285 °C.
Method according to claim 1,

characterised in that in a common heat exchanger the 
starting substance or mix of substances, is pre-heated to

a temperature of 190 to 300 °C and charged into the
pressurised reactor, in conjunction with the energy needed

for partial evaporation of excess water.
Method according to claims 1 to 2,

characterised in that for the production of polyamide 6.6
and copolyamides an aqueous solution of adipic acid

hexamethylene diamine or adipic acid and hexamethylene
diamine with a water content ≤ 40% is employed.
Method according to claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that in terms of the temperature the
process control in the pressurised reactor is undertaken

within the range between 190 and 280 °C in a defined
manner in dependence upon the proportion of caprolactam

and adipic acid hexamethylene diamine in the reaction
product, setting as a minimum condition a reaction mix

entry temperature of 190°C for a 40% AH salt content and
setting the temperature above 230°C for a raised AH salt

content of 75% and setting a temperature of up to 250°C
for a 90% AH salt content in the reaction mix.
Method according to claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that when producing copolyamide from ε-caprolactam
with a content of 1 to 99% and aqueous AH salt

solution the excess water is only taken off at a pressure
setting 
>
 0.6 MPa in the pressurised reactor.
Method according to claim 1 to 5,

characterised in that the dewatering of the polymer melt
is undertaken in a coil with a single turn, by systematic

slow reduction of pressure and supply of heat, and through
this the higher-viscosity polyamide 6 precondensate is

conveyed into the post-condenser, as is the polyamide 6.6
precondensate at a higher pressure and the copolymer. 
Method according to claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that the post-condensation of the polymer
melt is undertaken top-down in at least one common,

vertical reactor at temperatures within the range 210 to
285 °C and at an approximately barometric pressure, by

adjusting a low level of product with a large degassing
surface, dependent upon the excess of water in the charged

melt, when a high water content is present.
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to
claims 1 to 7 for the uniform, continuous production of

polyamides, more particularly polyamide 6, polyamide 6.6
and copolyamides derived from ε-caprolactam and/or adipic

acid hexamethylene diamine or adipic acid and
hexamethylene diamine, using and combining items of

apparatus from the respective individual processes to give
the polyamide types,

characterised in that arranged upstream of the pressurised
reactor (8) is a heat exchanger (7) which is connected to

a conveying and metering device, downstream of which the
following are alternatively arranged: a solubilising

device for AH salt or a receiving vessel for AH salt
solution and/or a receiving vessel for ε-caprolactam and

arranged on the pressurised reactor (8) is a rectifying
column (10) connected thereto and having a regulating

valve (11) and a condensation and immersion station (12)
and also a supply line for water (9), and the pressurised

reactor (8) is connected, by means of a heated pipe via a
pressure reducing and conveying device (13) and a melt

drying line (14) incorporating a coil with one to five
turns, to the post-condensation reactor (15), arranged

upon which a rectifier (17) with condensation and
immersion stage (18) is operatively connected and which

incorporates a heat exchanger for nitrogen (16) with a
charging device and a discharge pump (19) in the floor.
Apparatus according to claim 8,
 
characterised in that the conveying and metering device

incorporates a pump head for lactam (6.1) and a pump head

for AH salt solution (6.2) sharing a common drive, the
pump head for AH salt solution (6.2) being disposed

downstream, via a heated pipe, of a solubilising device
consisting of a solubilising vessel (1) with an

intermediate vessel for water (4) and container for AH
salt (5) and pump (2) at the outlet from the solubilising

vessel (1) and a heated ring line running via the heat
exchanger (3) back into the solubilising vessel (1).
Apparatus according to claims 8 and 9,

characterised in that the cooling device of the rectifying
column (10) is incorporated in parallel in the pipe

circuit of the receiving or solubilising vessel (1) for AH
salt solution.
