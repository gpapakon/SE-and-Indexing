<ABSTRACT>
A power converter for an AC generator for motor 
vehicles for converting a generated voltage of the AC 

generator driven by an engine into a DC voltage to feed to 
a battery includes at least either high-side MOS power 

transistors for connecting an output end of an armature coil 
which generates the generated voltage of the AC generator 

with a high potential end of a battery or low-side MOS power 
transistors for connecting the output end of the armature 

coil with a low potential end of the battery. The MOS power 
transistors each has a source region, a well region and a 

drain region. A high resistance connected with either a 
parasitic diode on the side connected with the source 

generated between the source region and well region or a 
parasitic diode on the side connected with the drain 

generated between the drain region and well region in 
parallel is formed in the MOS power transistors. Thereby, 

it allows blocking a reverse current produced by the 
parasitic diode and giving a necessary potential to the well 

region. Further, SiC is used in the MOS power transistors 
rather than Si.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power converter
for an AC (alternating current) motor vehicle generator
utilizing MOS power transistors and which is
applicable to an alternator capable of generating power by
turning kinetic energy during, braking of the vehicle into
electrical power and to the main drive motor of an electric
car, as well as to a so-called alternator driven by an
engine.There is known an AC generator for motor vehicles
which includes a three-phase full-wave rectifier as a power
converter having high-side semiconductor power elements and
low-side semiconductor power elements for individually
connecting each end of a three-phase armature winding of the
AC generator, respectively, with a high potential end and a
low potential end of a battery, and a controller for
synchronously connecting/disconnecting each semiconductor
power element and in which the three-phase full-wave
rectifier converts a generated voltage of the three-phase
armature winding into a DC voltage to feed to the battery.
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 4-138030, for example,
discloses using a MOS power transistor as the semiconductor
power element.The subject matter of this document constitutes the preamble of claim 1. That is, an N-channel MOS power transistor type
three-phase full-wave rectifier disclosed in the
above-mentioned publication has three high-side MOS power
transistors that connect each end of a three-phase armature
winding of an AC generator for motor vehicles with a high
potential end of a battery and three low-side MOS power
transistors that connect each end of the three-phase
armature winding with a low potential end of the battery.For the MOS power transistor of this type, it is
common to adopt a vertical MOS power transistor structure in
which an N-type silicon substrate is formed as one main
electrode of the MOS power transistor and an N+-type region
is formed on the surface of a P-type well region formed on
the surface of the chip as another main electrode to
maintain its withstanding voltage and to reduce ON
resistance.Further, while a parallel field coil scheme in
which a field coil, which is connected in parallel with a
three-phase full-wave rectifier, is used as a DC magnetizing
means of a magnet core of an AC generator for motor vehicles
and a magneto scheme whose structure and control are
relatively simple are generally used, the present applicant
has proposed a magneto scheme combined with a serial field
coil in which a three-phase full-wave rectifier and exciting
coil are connected in series
