<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to physical vapor deposition 
equipment such as are used in the fabrication of integrated 
circuits and semiconductor devices. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a process by 
which a target material (e.g. Ti) is deposited onto an 
object (e.g. a semiconductor wafer) by means of a plasma. 
The process takes place in a vacuum chamber that contains an 
inert gas (e.g. argon). The plasma, which is generated in 
the chamber between the negatively biased target and the 
wafer, ionizes the inert gas. The positively charged 
ionized gas atoms are pulled toward the negatively biased 
target and impact it with sufficient energy to expel (i.e., 
sputter) atoms of target material from the target. The 
sputtered atoms from the target are propelled toward the 
wafer where they form a layer of deposited material. The trajectories of the material coming off from the 
target during sputtering are distributed over a range of 
directions. Though typically most of the sputtered material 
is traveling in a direction that is normal to the target, a 
significant amount travels in other directions that diverge 
from the normal direction. The sputtered material traveling 
along the divergent directions tends to limit the definition  
 
that is obtainable at discontinuities on the wafer surface. 
More specifically, the material traveling along the non-normal 
trajectories deposits on the sidewalls of features 
such as thru holes and vias, thereby limiting how small one 
can make those features. For holes that are too small, the 
material deposited on the sidewalls eventually closes up the 
hole and prevents any further material from being deposited 
on the bottom of the hole. Collimation filters are used to filter out all 
sputtered material having a trajectory that diverges from 
the normal direction by more than a preselected angle. The 
collimation filter is placed between the target and the 
wafer. In general, it is a metal plate having a particular 
thickness with an array of holes passing through it. To 
maximize throughput, a honeycomb structure (i.e., a pattern 
of hexagonal holes) is used. The holes have a specified 
aspect ratio, i.e., the ratio of their length to their 
diameter. The aspect ratio determines the degree of 
filtering which takes place. A higher aspect ratio produces 
a narrower angular filter (i.e., the preselected angle is 
smaller). A consequence of using a higher aspect ratio, 
however, is a significantly reduced throughput. Thus, 
picking the appropriate thickness and hole
