<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mobile station (17) of a radiocommunications network comprising, on the one hand, means (111) for exchanging speech and, on the other hand, means (112) for exchanging data. Selection means (113) select, by default, the means (111) for speech exchange, and pass to the means (112) for data exchange when necessary. The data exchange means (112) comprise a set of elements tasked with sorting, analysing and processing the data and the commands exchanged between two items of terminal equipment, so that it is possible for one mobile item of terminal equipment (11), capable of exchanging data according to a first standard (for example V24 + protocole modem) to communicate with another remote item of terminal equipment (12) via a digital network implementing a second standard (for example V110+GSM network).

<CLAIMS>
Station of a digital mobile radio network for
exchanging speech signals and data signals characterised in

that it comprises:

connection means to a first data processing terminal
equipment (11) for bidirectional exchange of data to a first

data exchange standard using a single transfer channel
carrying data and commands simultaneously,
first means (112) for sending data to and receiving
data from a second data processing terminal equipment via said

mobile radio network according to a second data exchange
standard using a data transfer channel and a command transfer

channel,
second means (111) for sending speech signals to and
receiving speech signals from a remote terminal via said

mobile radio network according to a third data exchange
standard, and

   means for monitoring a bidirectional call between said
station and a remote terminal comprising:


means (113, 210) for selecting either said first or
said second transmitting and receiving means according to

whether said call carries data or a speech signal,
interface means between said first and second data
exchange standards comprising:


in the direction from the first standard to the
second standard:


means (21) for separating data and commands delivered
by said first terminal equipment,
first transcoding means (22) for transcoding said data
delivered by said separator means from said first standard to

said second standard and delivering data to be transmitted on
said data transfer channel,
first sorting means (23) for sorting said commands
into two sets of commands, a first set of commands to be

transmitted to said second terminal equipment and a second set 
of commands to be executed by said station,
means (24) for interpreting commands of said second
set of commands and delivering a second set of interpreted

commands,
first mapping means (25) for mapping commands of said
first set of commands and delivering commands to be

transmitted on said command transfer channel,
in the direction from the second standard towards
the first standard:


second sorting means (26) for sorting commands
received on said command transfer channel and delivering a

third set of commands to be transmitted to said first terminal
equipment and a fourth set of commands to be executed by said

station,
second mapping means (27) for mapping commands of said
third set of commands and delivering commands to be

transmitted to said first terminal equipment,
second transcoding means (28) for transcoding data
received on said data transfer channel from said second

standard to said first standard and delivering data to be
transmitted to said first terminal equipment,
means (29) for grouping said commands and said data to
be transmitted to said first terminal equipment in order to

transmit them over said single transfer channel, and
means (210) for supervising said call from said
second set of interpreted commands and said fourth set of

commands and handling initialisation, monitoring and
interruption of said call.
Station according to claim 1 characterised in that
said supervisor means (210) generate commands (236, 237) to be

transmitted on said single transfer channel and/or said
command transfer channel according to said second set of

interpreted commands, said fourth set of commands and external
information.
Station according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that said selector means (113; 210) select

said second speech signal transmit and receive means (111) by
default and said first data transmit and receive mans (112)

are selected on reception of a call request sent by said first
or said second terminal equipment.
Station according to any one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that said selector means (210) send a

specific instruction (234) to enable/disable certain modules
of said station when said first data transmit and receive

means are selected.
Station according to claim 4 characterised in that
said specific enabling/disabling instruction disables at least

some keys of a keypad.
Station according to any one of claims 1 to 5
characterised in that said first data standard is the V.24

standard associated with a modem protocol.
Station according to any one of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that said second data standard is the V.110

standard.
Station according to any one of claims 1 to 7
characterised in that said digital mobile radio network is a

GSM network.
Station according to any one of claims 1 to 8
characterised in that it comprises means for selecting between

at least two different data bit rates for exchanges of data to
said first data standard.
Station according to claim 9 characterised in that
it comprises means for adapting the format of the data

exchanged according to said second data standard depending on
said bit rate selected.
Station according to any one of claims 1 to 10
characterised in that it comprises means (240, 241)

for controlling the flows sent and/or received by said
station.
Station according to any one of claims 1 to 11 
characterised in that said first sorting means (23) deliver a

fifth set of commands for configuring (243) said station to
suit the requirements of said first equipment.
