<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to intubation
devices according to the preamble of claim 1. Such an
intubation device is known from US-A-4 444 185.Certain types of illness and injury can cause a
patient's airway to become blocked or otherwise impaired,
preventing adequate oxygenation and ventilation of the
patient. When this occurs, prompt corrective action must
be taken. Often times, this action requires the placement
of an endotracheal tube in the patient's trachea in order
to restore or maintain an adequate airway. The process of
inserting the tube in the patient is commonly referred to
as intubation.Over the years, various types of intubation
devices have been developed for inserting endotracheal
tubes in a patient. Perhaps the most commonly used
intubation technique is a process known as direct
laryngoscopy. In this technique, a device called a
laryngoscope is used to actually visualize the upper
airway through the patient's mouth during the process of
inserting the endotracheal tube. This technique is
usually successful in ensuring correct placement of the
tube in most patients. However, direct laryngoscopy is
not feasible under all circumstances. Indeed, performing
intubation on a relaxed, well-prepared patient in a
hospital setting is much different than attempting to
intubate an accident victim in a moving ambulance,
helicopter or on the street itself. Moreover, direct
aryngoscopy can have the disadvantage of increasing the
risk of dental and soft tissue trauma under certain
circumstances. When intubation is properly performed,
regardless of the procedure employed, the inserted end of
the endotracheal tube will be positioned in the patient's
trachea at a location substantially between the patient's
vocal cords and carina. This location has been found to
provide the best and most reliable airway management for
several reasons. If the tube is not inserted far enough
past the vocal cords, for example, it can become dislodged
and ineffective, such as when it ends up in the esophagus.
If the tube is inserted too far into the trachea, however,
past the carina, then the tube may only function to
adequately ventilate one of the lungs, instead of both.
This can lead to serious complications of its own. Thus,
proper placement of the inserted end of the tube plays a
major role in the intubation process.Various techniques have been used in the past to
attempt to ensure that the endotracheal tube lies in the
proper location between the patient's vocal cords and
carina at the end of the intubation process. One

tube (12) down against the flexible material and the

tube receiving portion (48) of the tube holder (22).
An intubation device (10) as claimed in claim 4,
wherein the flexible material includes a friction

enhanced surface for preventing movement between the
tube clamp means (46) and the endotracheal tube (12)
