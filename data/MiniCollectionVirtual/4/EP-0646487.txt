<ABSTRACT>
In a system which is supplied from a direct current source (1, 
2), primarily intended for traction purposes, at least two 

main inverters (3, 4) are connected pair-wise in series with 
the direct current source and each deliver a three-phase 

alternating current (5, 6). Two auxiliary inverters (10, 11) 
are connected in series to the same direct current source to 

deliver auxiliary power (13). According to the invention, a 
line (14) is connected between the junction points of the 

inverter pairs on the direct current side, and the alternating 
current outputs of the auxiliary inverters are each connected 

to a respective primary winding on a transformer (12). When 
one of the main inverters drops out, this enables power to be 

transferred to remaining main inverters through the medium of 
the parallel auxiliary inverters and the transformer, so as 

to provide emergency power.

<DESCRIPTION>
A method for compensating for the dropout or malfunctioning
of an inverter in a system in which several inverters are
connected in series to a source of direct current.The invention relates to
an inverter arrangement according to Claim
1.
The invention is primarily intended for use for traction
purposes in electrified railroads that are supplied with
direct current, although the invention is not limited to this
application and can be used in other applications.As is known, inverters include controllable semiconductor
components and find particular use in transmitting power
between direct current systems and alternating current
systems. For instance, when control is effected with the aid
of a control system it is possible to generate from a direct
current source a three-phase alternating current having
practically any desired frequency. This is utilized in many
electrified railroad systems with direct current supply and
short-circuited alternating current motors, which can be given
a starting torque, by initially supplying the motors at a low
frequency (e.g. 2 Hz) and then subsequently supplying the
motors at a higher frequency (e.g. up to 200 Hz).Inverters can be constructed with series-connected valve
elements (thyristors extinguishable thyristors, transistors),
to a number of valves. Each element is only able to take-up
a limited voltage drop, although very high voltages can be
taken-up as a result of the series connection, as is the case
with high-voltage direct current transmission. If a single
valve element breaks down (short-circuits), a valve will still
remain serviceable in many instances. The valve will become
unserviceable, however, should too many valve elements break
down. When a moderate direct-current voltage is applied and 
the valve contains only a few valve elements, the valve will
become unserviceable after only a very few of the elements have
short-circuited. When each valve is comprised of only one
single valve element, for instance an extinguishable thyristor,
it may require only one single element to fail in order to
knock out a complete inverter.Because the maximum voltage for semiconductor components
constantly increases, this occurrence becomes more and more
usual.In many cases a total dropout of an inverter cannot be
accepted. One example in this respect is found in railroad
locomotives, where a redundancy is necessary for the locomotive
to at least be able to crawl to the next station. One known
method of achieving this involves coupling two inverters in
series to the

<CLAIMS>
An inverter arrangement having a direct-current input (1,
2) and at least two alternating-current outputs (5, 6), each

being supplied from a respective main inverter (3, 4) which are
connected in series to the direct current input, wherein the

alternating current outputs of said inverters are connected to
at least one motor (T), and an inverter control unit (C),

connected in parallel with an auxiliary inverter (10, 11); in

that the alternating current outputs of the auxiliary inverters
are connected to a common transformer (12), wherein the

transformer is constructed to transfer alternating current
power from one of the auxiliary inverters, whose corresponding

parallel-connected main inverter is out of operation, to at
least one other auxiliary inverter; and in that the control

unit (C) is adapted to control at least the auxiliary inverters
by means of pulsewidth modulation in a four quadrant operation,

enabling electric power to be delivered from an auxiliary inverter,
whose corresponding parallel-connected main inverter is

the main inverters are two in number.
An arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized

that all inverters are voltage rigid.
An arrangement according to any one of Claims 1-3,

disconnecting or isolating each of said main inventers (3, 4)in

case of its failure.
