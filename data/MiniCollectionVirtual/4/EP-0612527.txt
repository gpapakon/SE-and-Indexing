<ABSTRACT>
An antiulcer agent effective on prevention of 
ulceration and acceleration of healing of ulcers and 

processes for preparing the same are disclosed. The 
antiulcer agent comprises rhamnan (a homopolysaccharide), 

rhamnose or a rhamnose oligomer as an active ingredient. 
Rhamnan is prepared by separating rhamnan sulfate from 

rhamnan sulfate-containing algae and desulfurating the 
rhamnan sulfate. Rhamnan oligomers are prepared by 

hydrolyzing rhamnan obtained by desulfuration of rhamnan 
sulfate or by hydrolyzing microbial cells of a 

Bifidobacterium or polysaccharides separated therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antiulcer agent 
effective for prevention and treatment of a gastric ulcer and 
to a process for preparing the same. Conventional antiulcer agents include those for 
controlling gastric juice secretion, such as Hâ‚‚-blockers and 
proton pump inhibitors. Since a relapse of a gastric ulcer 
often appears after discontinuation of administration of 
these drugs, use of prostaglandins or gastric mucosa 
protecting agents has recently been studied. On the other hand, the present inventors previously 
found that microbial cells of certain species of 
Bifidobacteria or lactic acid bacteria and polysaccharides 
extracted therefrom are effective in not only the prevention 
of ulceration but also in the acceleration of healing of 
ulcers and are useful as antiulcer agents (see JP-A-4-5236, 
the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published 
Japanese patent application"). The polysaccharides of 
Bifidobacterium origin, whose antiulcer action had been 
confirmed, are heteropolysaccharides composed of rhamnose, 
glucose, galactose, glucosamine, etc. The mechanism of 
antiulcer action of the above-mentioned microbial cells or 
polysaccharides has not yet been elucidated.  An object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel antiulcer agent effective in the prevention of 
ulceration and in the acceleration of healing of ulcers. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a process for preparing the above-described antiulcer agent. The present invention relates to an antiulcer agent 
containing rhamnan, which is a homopolysaccharide, as an 
active ingredient and to an antiulcer agent containing 
rhamnose or a rhamnose oligomer as an active ingredient. The present invention also relates to (1) a process 
for preparing an antiulcer agent comprising separating 
rhamnan sulfate from rhamnan sulfate-containing algae, 
subjecting the rhamnan sulfate to desulfuration, recovering 
rhamnan from the reaction product, and using the resulting 
rhamnan as an active ingredient, (2) a process for preparing 
an antiulcer agent comprising separating rhamnan sulfate from 
rhamnan sulfate-containing algae, subjecting the rhamnan 
sulfate to desulfuration, hydrolyzing the resulting rhamnan, 
recovering rhamnan having a reduced molecular weight and/or 
rhamnose oligomers from the hydrolysis product, and using the 
resulting rhamnan having a reduced molecular weight and/or 
rhamnose oligomers as an active ingredient, or (3) a process 
for preparing an antiulcer agent comprising
