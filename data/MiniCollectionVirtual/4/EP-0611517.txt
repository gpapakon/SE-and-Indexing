<ABSTRACT>
In a reversible plough which consists of a front and a rear plough frame (1, 2) and of which the joint (3) provided between these is inclined approximately vertically or obliquely rearwards in the raised position of the reversible plough, the knocking of the rear plough frame during turning is to be prevented by appropriate damping. For this purpose, according to the invention, there is provided a single hydraulic push motor (12) which is pivotably fastened to one of the two plough frames so as to engage over the joint and is located in a hydraulic circuit, in which, in addition to a pressure-dependent throttle point (11), a two-way flow valve (26) is provided, in order to achieve uniform damping.
