<ABSTRACT>
In a pneumatically actuated gripping device, a pair 
of gripping members (22, 23) are pivotally hinged to 

spaced apart support members (28, 29) removably 
connected to the body of a pneumatic control cylinder 

(10). The piston-rod (16) of the control cylinder 
(10) is provided with a cilindrical rack portion (19) 

engaging a pinion rack sector (20, 21) coaxially 
arranged to a pivot pin (26, 27) at the hinging end 

of each gripping member (22, 23).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dismountable 
gripping device or mechanical hand for manipulators 
or robots, of the type comprising opposed gripping 
members which are reciprocable by a pneumatic 
cylinder to be moved from an open condition to a 
partially or totally closed condition for grip and 
release objects to be moved by the manipulator 
provided with the same gripping device. The use of manipulators having mechanical pliers for 
gripping and manipulating objects is a very common 
practice in many industrial fields due to their 
greater ability to effectively and safely operate as 
a replacement for a human operator. Nevertheless traditional mechanical pliers are 
fixedly mounted on the manipulator and must be 
especially designed and manufactured for a specific 
or intended uses and generally have a somewhat 
complex structure, which is difficult to modify or 
adapt for different uses other than those originally 
foreseen. Furthermore prior known gripping devices  
 
must be suitably assembled by a skilled operator 
before being mounted on a manipulator or robot 
device. It would therefore be desirable to have a mechanical 
gripping device which is easy to manufacture from 
standard component parts which can easily be 
assembled and disassembled by the same user when 
required in order to provide pliers having different 
features without disassembling the entire gripping 
device. Therefore the object of the present invention is to 
provide a mechanical gripping device, pneumatically 
actuated, consisting of few and easily assemblable 
parts enabling the use of standardised components. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a pneumatically actuated gripping device of 
the abovementioned kind, which has relatively small 
overall dimensions and which at the same time has a 
high gripping capability within a wide range, which 
can reach or even exceed an angle of 60°. A further object of the present invention is to  
 
provide a gripping device having oscillating jaw 
members to provide a gripping force of substantially 
constant value, independently of the angular position 
assumed by the same jaws and of the dimensions of the 
objects to be gripped or manipulated. The abovementioned objects are achieved by means of a 
mechanical gripping device, according to Claim 1, of 
the type comprising opposed gripping members, which 
are actuated by a pneumatic control cylinder to 
rotate between an open and a closed condition, 
wherein the gripping members are hinged and guided by 
late

<CLAIMS>
A gripping device of the type comprising: 
opposite gripping members (22, 23) pivotally 

supported by the body portion of a control cylinder 
(10) to rotate between closed and open conditions; 

   a pneumatically actuated control cylinder (10) 
having a piston chamber (12) and a piston member (11) 

reciprocable in said piston chamber (12), and piston-rod 
(16) operatively connected to the gripping member 

by rack means (19, 20, 21), 
   characterised in that said rack means comprises 

a circular rack member (19) at the fore end of the 
piston-rod (16), said circular rack (19) engaging 

with pinion-rack sectors (20, 21) provided at the 
rear portion of the gripping members (22, 23) of the 

gripping device, each of said pinion rack sectors 
(20, 21) being coaxially disposed in respect to a 

pivot pin (26, 27) orthogonally arranged in respect 
to the circular rack member (19) of the device; 

   said pivot pins (26, 27) and said gripping 
members (22, 23) being disengagably provided between 

spaced apart supporting plate members (28, 29), said 
supporting plate members (28, 29) being removably 

 
fastened to the body of the control cylinder (10) by 

screw means (30) and guiding means on facing surfaces 
of said plate members (28, 29) and rack sectors (20, 

21) of the gripping members (22, 23) of said gripping 
device. 
A gripping device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that said pivot pins (26, 27) are 

freely threaded into a trhough hole of the gripping 
members and dead holes axially aligned in the plate 

members (28, 29) for rotatably supporting the 
gripping members (22, 23) of the device. 
A gripping device according to Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that said circular rack member (19) 

comprises a threaded shank portion (18) removably 
screwed into a threaded hole axially extending in the 

piston-rod (16) of the control cylinder (10) of the 
gripping device.
