<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a binder resin for high
image quality toners used in copying machines and
electrophotograph's printers which are excellent in anti-offset
property, fixing property, blocking resistance, and
image characteristics.Typical image forming processes in electrophotography or
electrostatic printing comprise a developing step for
uniformly charging a photoconductive insulated layer,
exposing the insulated layer, dispersing the charges on the
exposed portions to form an electrical latent image, and
adhering charged fine toner particles on the latent image to
make it visible; a transferring step for transferring the
visible image thus obtained onto a transfer material such as
transfer paper; and a fixing step for permanently fixing it
by heat or pressure.Various performances are required in each of the steps
mentioned above for toners and binder resins for toners used
in electrophotography or electrostatic printing. For
instance, toners and binder resins for toners have to
maintain an amount of electrostatic charge appropriate to
copying machines without being affected by the surrounding
environment such as the temperature and humidity to adhere
toners on electrical latent images at the developing step.
Also, the anti-offset property, that is, the property of not-adhering
to heated rollers, and the fixing property on papers
must be excellent at the fixing step in a heated roller
fixing method. Further, a blocking resistance, that is, the
property of toners not blocking during storage, and excellent
image characteristics are also required.Heretofore, styrene-acrylic type resins have been widely
used. Specifically, linear type resins and cross-linked type 
resins have been used as binder resins for toners. In the
linear type resins, resins are known which are prepared by
blending a polymer of a high molecular weight with a polymer
of a low molecular weight to improve the fixing property and
anti-offset property. In the cross-linked type resins,
improvements in the fixing property and anti-offset property
are being made by broadening the molecular weight
distribution by cross-linking. Particularly, considerable
research is being carried out on linear type resin. As
described in the specifications of Japanese Examined Patent
Publication No. 63-32182, Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication No. 62-9356, and others, attempts are being made
to improve the fixing property and anti-offset property by
controlling the region and molecular weight high molecular
weight and low molecular weight
