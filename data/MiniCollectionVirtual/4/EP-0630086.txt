<ABSTRACT>
A recess (11) is formed in an insulator nose 
(10). Arranged within the recess (11) is a heater (13) 

formed, for example, by baking a metal paste of powder 
of a metal such as Pt or W, alumina powder and an 

acrylic or cellulose-base binder. The heater (13) is 
covered and held in place by a high softening-point 

glass layer (15) with an alumina layer (14) interposed 
therebetween. Preferably, the alumina layer (14) on 

the heater (13) can have a thickness in a range of 20-200 
µm whereas the thickness of the high softening-point 

glass layer (15) can range from 30 µm to 500 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a heater-equipped spark plug 
according to the preamble of claim 1. JP-A 2-278 685, corresponding with the preamble of claim 1, discloses a spark plug equipped with a heater. 
This spark plug is obtained by coating a surface of an unsintered 
insulator nose with a conductive paste, forming an 
insulating layer of alumina on the conductive paste and then 
sintering the unsintered nose together with the conductive 
layer and the insulating layer. Although this spark plug has 
the advantage that the conductive paste can be coated with 
ease, it is only the alumina layer that is formed on the 
heater to cover and insulate the latter. The alumina layer 
cannot maintain insulation sufficiently, so that ignitability 
cannot be retained fully for an air-fuel mixture.  
 To prevent deposit of carbon on an insulator 
nose, especially at low temperatures when employed in 
an internal combustion engine of an automotive vehicle 
or the like, it has heretofore been the general practice 
to use a spark plug with a nichrome wire wound on 
and around an insulator nose which holds a center electrode 
in the vicinity of a free end of an axial bore. 
Because the nichrome wire is prone to oxidation and 
burning-up through its exposure to high-temperature 
combustion gas of a gas-fuel mixture, the spark plug is 
accompanied by the drawback that its service life is 
short. With a view to overcoming this drawback, spark 
plugs have been proposed, including a spark plug with a 
resistance heating pattern formed from a high m.p.  
 
(melting point) metallized ink on a surface of an insulator 
nose [Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open (Kokai) 
No. SHO 54-164322] as well as a spark plug formed by 
printing a resistance heating pattern layer with a high 
m.p. metallized ink of tungsten, molybdenum, platinum 
or the like on a surface of a green ceramic substrate 
of alumina or the like, forming an insulating covering 
layer by a ceramic sheet or paste of alumina or the 
like on the resistance heating pattern layer, winding 
the green ceramic substrate, which carries thereon the 
resistance heating pattern layer printed on its surface 
and covered by the insulating covering layer, on and 
around a nose of an insulator, and then simultaneously 
sintering the ceramic substrate and the resistance 
heating pattern layer together with the insulator to 
integrally bond the former to the nose of the latter 
[Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open (Kokai) No. SHO 55-10239]. These conventional spark plugs are however still 
acc
