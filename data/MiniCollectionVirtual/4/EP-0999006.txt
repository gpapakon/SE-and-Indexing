<ABSTRACT>
Within the hermetically sealed interior of a
housing 9, a driving bevel gear 15 is fixedly

secured to an input shaft 12 coupled via a rotation
transmission cable 5 to an output shaft of a drive

unit. A spindle 19 rotates jointly and coaxially
with the driving bevel gear 15, which meshes with a

driven bevel gear 17 coupled in such a manner as to
allow a relative displacement in the axial

direction.
The spindle 19 has an externally threaded
portion 19A screwed in an internally threaded

portion 20A of a master metal 20. The spindle 19
has one end protruding from the housing 9 to the

exterior, the one end being provided with a spindle
chuck 21 for retaining a tap T.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
tapping unit adapted to be mounted on a machine
body, a die, a hand, a jig, etc., of a press, an
industrial robot, a transfer apparatus, etc.,
(hereinafter these are referred to generically as
working machines), the tapping unit serving to tap a
workpiece during the processes of the working
machines.In the event that the workpiece is subjected
to tapping by means of a tapper during the process
of the press in continuous operations, the tapping
time allocated to the one cycle of the press tends
to become short, making it difficult to put the
tapping timings in synchronism.Furthermore, owing to the vertical movement
and the horizontal movement effected between the
feed position and the machining position when the
workpiece is delivered to the next process, it is
difficult to three-dimensionally precisely position
the tap relative to the workpiece and to complete
the forward and reverse rotations at accurate feed
pitches.In addition, a mechanism for tapping has to be
incorporated in a limited space within the press
die.To address such problems, a variety of
techniques have hitherto been proposed, as in for
example Japan Patent No. 2, 562, 298. This has a
structure as shown in FIG. 13 in which a screw/nut
system coupled to a movable part A2 of a press A1
toward a ram is used to convert the vertical
movements of the movable part A2 into forward and
reverse rotational movements and in which the tap is
driven by way of a transmission mechanism of a
tapper A4 mounted on a die associated with a bed, to
thereby tap a workpiece W resting on the press Al.As can be seen from Japan Patent Laid-open
Pub. Nos. Hei 7-112324, Hei 4-289021 and Hei 7-060545,
tappers have also been proposed in which a
motor is provided and is fitted to the die or the
press head without utilizing the movements of the
press movable part as the driving forces. Furthermore, as seen in FIG. 14, a technique
is known in the past in which the direction of
rotations of an output shaft B3 is changed by use of
a rotation transmission cable B2 extending from a
tapping machine or a drilling machine having a multi
spindle head B1, to rotate a spindle B7 screwed with
a master metal B6 fitted to a press B5.The technique shown in the diagram enables the
hexagonal shaft or the sleeve with splines for
rotating a spindle B7 to be eliminated since the
flexibility of the rotation transmission cable B2
can accommodate the screwing stroke L of the spindle
B7 carrying a tap T, and is widely used typically as
means for

<CLAIMS>
A tapping unit (1) comprising:

a housing (9) with the hermetically sealed
interior, removably secured to a movable member of a

working machine such as a press (2), said movable member
being displaced together with a workpiece (W);
an input shaft 12 rotatably supported via a
bearing 14 within the interior of said housi
ng (9), said
input shaft (12) having one end protruding outwardly from

said housing (9), said one end being coupled to an
output shaft of a drive unit (3) by way of a rotation

transmission cable (5);
a first driving bevel gear (15) fixedly secured to the
other end of said input shaft (12) within said housing (9)
a second driven bevel gear (17) meshed with said first driving
bevel gear (15) and rotatably supported via a bearing (16) at

a fixed location within said housing (9)
a spindle (19) rotating jointly and coaxially with
said second driven bevel gear (17), said spindle (19) being coupled

to said second driven bevel gear (17) in such a manner as to
allow a relative displacement in the axial

direction, said spindle (19) having one end protruding
outwardly from said housing (9), said one end being

provided with a spindle chuck (21) for holding a tap (T),
said spindle (19) having a portion lying at all times

within the interior of said housing (9) said portion
having an externally threaded portion (19A) formed on its

outer periphery; and
a master metal (20) fixedly secured to the interior
of said housing (9), said master metal (20) having an

internally threaded portion (20A) mating with said
externally threaded portion (19A) of said spindle (19)
The tapping unit according to claim 1, wherein
said internally threaded portion (20A) of said master

metal (20) being formed with at least one oil storage
groove (20D) extending in the direction intersecting with

threaded grooves.
The tapping unit according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein said drive unit (3) has a drive source in the

form of a pulse motor (6) so as to ensure that forward
and reverse actions of the said tap (T) in a tapping

process are effected in a brief period of time
during which said movable member of said working

machine carries said workpiece (W), and wherein timings 
of forward and reverse actions and halt are

controlled on the basis of timing signals issued
from said working machine in response to locations

of said movable member.
The tapping unit according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein the rotational angle and axial location of

said tap (T) are subjected to an absolute value control
based on driving pulse signals fed from associated

said working machine into said pulse motor (6).
