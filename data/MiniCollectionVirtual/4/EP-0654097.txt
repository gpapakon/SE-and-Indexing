<ABSTRACT>
In order to prevent the vibrations generated by the rotation of a galette from being transmitted to a galette-heating inductor (16), the inductor (16) is mounted on a vibration damper (27) so as to be free from vibrations. The vibration damper (27) is arranged between the flange (9) of a supporting cylinder (18) for supporting the inductor (16) and a front wall (32) of the housing. An additional vibration damper ring (30) is provided inside of a centering ring (24) in order to radially dampen the inductor (16). The flange (9) is pressed by screws (26) against the vibration damper (27). A pressure spring (25) arranged between the screw (26) and the flange (9) presses against the flange (9).
