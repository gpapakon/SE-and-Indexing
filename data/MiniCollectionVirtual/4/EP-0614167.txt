<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to electrical
circuits for, and methods of, operating electrode
structures in systems constructed of data storage elements
which employ an ionizable gas to address an array of such
storage elements.U.S. Patent No. 4,896,149, issued January 23,
1990, to Buzak et al. ("'149 Patent") and assigned to the
present applicants, discloses an
addressing structure using an ionizable gaseous medium.
Such an addressing structure may be used in a system
constructed of data storage elements which addresses those
data storage elements with the use of an ionizable gas.
An example of such a system is a flat panel display, a
video camera, or a memory system.The system disclosed in the '149 Patent has an
electrode structure which defines rows of channels, each
of which is filled with an ionizable gas. Extending along
the base of each of those channels are a row electrode and
a reference electrode. The row electrode is electrically
driven as a cathode, and the reference electrode is
referenced to ground and acts as an anode when the row
electrode is electrically driven as a cathode. When a
particular row electrode is driven as a cathode, the
ionizable gas in the particular channel which contains
that row electrode is ionized, and the system operates as 
disclosed in the '149 Patent.One embodiment of the system disclosed in the
'149 Patent is a flat panel display system in which the
electric field across an electro-optic material containing
a liquid crystal material is changed in response to data
signals provided over data electrodes.Several types of distortion are observed when
operating such a flat panel display. Low or high
intensity (e.g., generally black or generally white)
streaks (in this case, gradients in intensity) often
appear in a direction transverse to the length of a
channel between the two sides of individual display
elements ("pixels") defined in part by the channel
("cross-talk across the width of a pixel"). In addition,
low, intermediate, and high intensity (e.g., generally
black, grey, and generally white) streaks extending along
the length of a channel (i.e., parallel to the reference
electrode and the row electrode) often appear between the
two sides of pixels above a channel that contains multiple
pixels that are intended to have highest intensity (e.g.,
to appear black) ("horizontal cross-talk along the length
of a channel"). In addition, pixels often flicker between
low, intermediate, and high intensity ("flicker") or
continue to display an image from a preceding image
