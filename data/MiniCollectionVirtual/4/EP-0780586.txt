<ABSTRACT>
A hemispherical fluid bearing and a manufacturing method thereof are 
provided. The hemispherical fluid bearing has a pair of inner rings 

(20), each having a spherical outer lubricating surface, which are fixed 
to a shaft (10) to face each other, and an outer ring (50) having a 

lubricating surface corresponding to the lubracating surfaces of the 
inner rings (20) for supporting the rotation of the inner rings (20). 

One of the inner rings (20) and the outer ring (50) has a first film 
coating of titanium or ceramic formed on the lubricating surface 

thereof. Therefore, abrasion due to solid friction when a motor starts 
or stops, is efficiently decreased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bearing, and more
particularly, to a hemispherical fluid bearing.In general, fluid bearings are used for supporting
articles rotating at high speed. A conventional contact
bearing such as a ball bearing or a roller bearing makes
severe oscillation and noise, and rotates unstably, at high
speed. On the contrary, a fluid bearing, which rotates at high
speed in a non-contact manner, seldom oscillates and rotates
stably. Therefore, the fluid bearing can find its applications
in spindle motors of hard disk drives which must rotate
rapidly, or a rotative multi-surfaced mirror driving motor
used in laser printers or laser scanners.FIG. 1 is a sectional view of a conventional
hemispherical bearing which is one of the fluid bearings (EP 0 376 647 A). As
shown, the conventional hemispherical fluid bearing is
comprised of an upper inner ring 20 and a lower inner ring 30,
each having a hemispherical outer surface, which are fixed to
a shaft 10 of a motor to be face-to-face with each other, an
outer ring 50 fixed in a bearing housing 40, a ring 60 for
keeping upper inner ring 20 and lower inner ring 30 from being
detached from shaft 10, a spacer 70 disposed between upper
inner ring 20 and lower inner ring 30 for maintaining
clearance between outer ring 50 and upper inner ring 20, and
between outer ring 50 and lower inner ring 30.Outer ring 50 supports upper inner ring 20 and lower 
inner ring 30 so that they can rotate. Since lubricant oil
fills the clearance between outer ring 50 and inner rings 20
and 30 and generates fluid friction therebetween, upper inner
ring 20 and lower inner ring 30 can rotate without making
contact with outer ring 50. Therefore, a motor employing the
hemispherical fluid bearing produces no oscillation and its
rotation is stable.However, the conventional hemispherical fluid bearing
exhibits a distinct drawback in that the contact surfaces of
outer ring 50 and inner rings 20 and 30 abrade when the motor
starts and stops. That is, solid friction occurs between outer
ring 50 and upper inner ring 20, and between outer ring 50 and
lower inner ring 30, at or below a threshold speed, thus
accelerating the abrasion. As a result, the life span of the
hemispherical fluid bearing decreases.The object of the present invention is to provide a
hemispherical fluid bearing which can efficiently decrease
abrasion caused by solid friction.To achieve the above object, there is provided a
hemispherical fluid bearing comprising a pair of inner rings,
each having a spherical
