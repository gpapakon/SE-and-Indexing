<ABSTRACT>
A spacer frame which comprises a hollow profile moulding bent-off three times and is still open at the fourth corner, one leg (2) being longer than the other leg leading to the open corner, is filled with a granular drying agent via a tube (20) which has been introduced into the leg (2). The tube (20) projects, with its front end (20'), into the leg (2) up to the desired filling height. As soon as the drying agent in the leg (2) reaches the tube (20), the inflow of drying agent ceases. A sensor (27) detects this. The sensor (27) activates the drawing-out operation of the tube (20). In this arrangement, subatmospheric pressure is applied to the tube (20) via a line (40) in order that no more drying agent is discharged out of the tube (20).

A method of partially filling hollow bodies with granulate, characterized in that 
a probe connected to a supply container for granulate is inserted into the hollow body 

so far that its leading end is disposed at the place in the hollow body up to which the 
latter is to be filled with granulate, in that the feeding of granulate is broken off as 

soon as the hollow body has been filled with granulate up to the leading end of the 
probe, and in that the probe is then withdrawn from the hollow body. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the movement of granulate 
into the probe is monitored and the filling operation is broken off as soon as the 

movement of granulate in the probe stops. 
A method according to claim 2, characterized in that the movement of granulate 
is monitored by a movement sensor. 
A method according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the outflow of 
granulate from the probe is prevented during its withdrawal from the hollow body, in 

that a vacuum is applied to the probe at a distance from the free end thereof. 
A method of filling a spacer frame for insulating glass formed from at least one 
hollow profiled strip with granular desiccant, wherein the spacer frame has three 

corners, preferably formed by bending and is open at the fourth corner, wherein 
granular desiccant is filled through the open ends into one or both of the sides of the 

frame leading to this open corner and the frame is then closed, wherein the one frame 
side is longer than the other and the lengthened frame side is filled up to below its 

bending site and the shortened frame arm is partially filled, characterized in that the 
method according to one or more of claims 1 to 4 is employed and in that the frame is 

closed, after the filling operation and after bending the longer frame side at the 
bending site, by a straight connector or by welding or soldering the open ends.  

 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to any of claims 1 to 4, with a 
supply container (10) for granulate and a holder (6, 7) for the hollow body (1) to be 

filled, characterized in that at least one probe (20, 21) is provided which can be 
introduced into the hollow body (1) to be filled, in that the probe (20, 21) is connected 

to the supply container (10) for granulate through a line (11, 12), in that a sensor (26, 
27) for monitoring movements of the granulate is associated with the line (11, 12) or 

the probe (20, 21), and in that a line (40, 41) for applying a vacuum is connected to 
the probe (20, 21) at a distance from its free end. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that an adjustable depth stop 
(50) is provided in addition to the probe (20, 21) to limit the depth of insertion of the 

probe (20, 21) into the hollow body (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that the probe (20, 21) is 
retained on a holder (25, 25') which can be displaced through a pre-selectable path (X) 

when introducing the probe (20, 21) into the hollow body (1) through the open end 
(29) thereof. 
Apparatus according to any of claims 6 to 8, characterized in that a wall part 
(44) which is permeable to air but impermeable to granulate, for example a sieve or 

the like, is provided at the point of attachment of the line (40, 41) for the vacuum to 
the wall of the probe (20, 21). 
Apparatus according to any of claims 6 to 9, for carrying out the method 
according to claim 5, characterized in that a holder (6, 7) is provided for fixing the 

frame sides (2, 3) leading to the still open corner, and in that two probes (20, 21) are 
provided, which can be introduced into the open ends of the frame sides (2, 3). 
Apparatus according to claim 10, characterized in that the probes (20, 21) are 
mounted on a common support (25).  

 
Apparatus according to claim 10, characterized in that the probes (20, 21) are 
mounted on holders (25, 25') which can be moved independently of one another and 

which are so guided on the machine frame that they can be introduced to different 
extents into the open frame sides (2, 3). 
Apparatus according to any of claims 6 to 12, characterized in that a controller 
(30) is provided, to which is fed a signal from the sensor (26, 27) associated with the 

at least one line (11, 12) or probe (20, 21) as soon as the sensor detects an interruption 
in the movement of the granulate in the line (11, 12) or in the probe (20, 21), in that 

the controller (30) issues a' signal which triggers closure of the shut-off member (13, 
14) in the line (11, 12) between probe (20, 21) and supply container (10) for granulate, 

and in that the controller (30) effects withdrawal of the probe (20, 21) and 
simultaneously subjects the probe (20, 21) to vacuum.
