<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and a method for measuring the temperature 
of a reactive metallic workpiece sealed within a retort prior to 

and during diffusion bonding of the workpiece. The apparatus 
includes temperature measuring instruments disposed adjacent 

preselected portions of the workpiece within the retort, thermal 
conducting means connecting the instruments with display devices 

located outside the retort, conduits coupled with the interior of 
the retort and with the display devices, each of the conduits 

including a first end portion communicating the interior of the 
retort with vacuum generating means and a second end portion 

including at least one tubular region through which the thermal 
conducting means pass to connect with the display devices, and 

means for sealing the first and second end portions to maintain 
an evacuated state within the retort after a vacuum is applied 

thereto. The method contemplates measuring the temperature at 
the preselected portions of the workpiece within the retort while 

conducting the diffusion bonding process and then using the 
measured temperatures to control the temperatures applied to and 

within the retort during subsequent diffusion bonding processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to methods and 
systems for temperature measurement and control inside a 
container during a high temperature heating process, and more 
particularly to the measurement and control of temperatures 
within a sealed container or retort prior to and during diffusion 
bonding of a metallic sandwich structure. A well-known technique for joining metal is diffusion 
bonding. This process involves metallurgically joining surfaces 
of similar or dissimilar metals by applying heat and pressure for 
a time duration so as to cause co-mingling of atoms at the joint 
interface.  
 In the diffusion bonding process, the application of 
pressure accomplishes a plastic flow of the material to fill 
normal void areas. If the pressure is too low, small voids will 
remain at the joint interface and the joint strength will be less 
than the maximum attainable. The application of pressure also 
breaks up the surface oxides and surface asperites so as to 
press clean surfaces for bonding. The elevated temperatures used for diffusion bonding 
serve to accelerate diffusion of atoms at the joint interfaces as 
well as to provide a metal softening which aids in surface 
deformation thereby allowing more intimate contact for atom 
bonding and movement across the joint interface. Through practice of this technique, it has become 
accepted that diffusion bonding of certain "reactive" metals, 
such as titanium and its alloys, must be conducted in a 
controlled environment in order to ensure cleanliness of the 
materials which are particularly sensitive to oxygen, nitrogen, 
and water vapor content in the air at elevated temperatures. 
Unless the metals are protected during this bonding process, they 
will become embrittled and their structural integrity will be 
destroyed.  
 The controlled environment has been attained through the 
use of a closed, sealed and evacuated metallic envelope known as 
a "retort". Typically, the retort is provided with external 
instrumentation for the purpose of monitoring the parameters of 
the diffusion bonding process. However, it has been found that, 
under these circumstances, exact measurement inside the retort of 
the temperatures of the components necessary for successful and 
repeatable diffusion bonding is not attainable. Several approaches have been attempted to remedy this 
problem. At first, analytical modeling was employed using heat 
transfer calculations. Thereafter, more sophisticated approaches 
involved instrumenting a dummy part at preselected
