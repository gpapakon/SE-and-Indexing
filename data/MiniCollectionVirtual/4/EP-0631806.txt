<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention - This invention relates to 
improved membranes for gas and vapor permeation. More 
particularly, it relates to improved composite 
membranes and preparation thereof. Description of the Prior Art - Asymmetric and 
composite membranes capable of selectively separating 
one component of a gaseous or vapor mixture from 
another component are well known in the art. For 
practical commercial operations, such membranes must be 
durable and essentially free of imperfections, and must 
be capable of achieving an acceptable level of 
selectivity of the desired component, exhibiting a high 
permeation rate for the more rapidly permeable 
component of the gas or vapor mixture being processed. Integrally skinned asymmetric membranes are 
currently used for numerous gas separation processes. 
Though manufacturing of essentially defect-free, ultra 
high flux asymmetric membranes is known in the art, for 
example, in the Pinnau et al. patent, U.S.-A-4,902,422, 
and the Sanders et al. patent, U.S.-A-4,772,392, it is 
known to be excessively difficult to produce such 
membranes. Thus, it is common practice in the art to 
subject asymmetric gas separation membranes to 
treatments that effectively eliminate defects that may 
be present in the ultrathin membrane separation layers. 
The Henis et al. patent, U.S.-A-4,230,463, addresses the 
problem of the presence of defects in asymmetric gas 
separation membranes and discloses the formation of 
multi-component membranes by applying a coating, 
typically a silicone rubber coating, to the surface of  
 
an asymmetric membrane made of a glassy polymer. Other 
defect-repair methods are disclosed in the Frisen et 
al. patent, U.S.-A-4,877,528, the Peinemann et al. 
patent, U.S.-A-4,746,333, and the Smith et al. patent, 
U.S.-A-4,776,936. A different class of gas or vapor separation 
membranes are composite membranes that are produced by 
depositing a thin gas separation layer on a porous 
support. The material of the deposited layer, unlike 
that of the coating of the Henis et al. patent, 
determines the gas separation characteristics of the 
overall membrane structure. Such composite membranes 
are sometimes more advantageous than asymmetric 
membranes since they allow decoupling of the separation 
requirements from the engineering design requirements 
of the porous substrate. A variety of separation layer 
materials, support structures and membrane 
manufacturing methods are known in the art for 
producing composite membranes. Typical examples of 
composi

A process for the production of a multilayer composite membrane comprising: 

(a) applying a thin layer of a coating solution to a substrate, said coating solution 
comprising not more than about 5 g/100ml of a polymeric material in a solvent 

system, and not more than about 20% by weight, based on the weight of said 
material, of at least one additive comprising polysiloxane, said material being 

capable of forming a membrane for the separation of gas or vapor mixtures; and 
(b) drying the thin coating layer on the substrate, thereby forming a multilayer 
composite membrane having at least one interior separation layer of the polymeric 

membrane forming material, that substantially determines the gas or vapor 
separation characteristics of the membrane, deposited on the substrate and an 

exterior protective layer of said additive over said interior separation layer, 
whereby the exterior protective layer serves to protect the separation layer from 

imperfections. 
The process of Claim 1 in which the interior 
separation layer comprises 80% or more of the overall 

thickness of the coating, and the exterior defect 
sealing layer comprises 20% or less thereof.  

 
The process of claim 1 in which the concentration of the membrane forming material in 
the coating solution is less than about 2 g/100ml.  

 
The process of Claim 1 in which the 
concentration of the additive in the coating solution  

 
is less than 5% by weight, based on the weight of the 

membrane forming material in the coating solution. 
The process of Claim 4 in which said 
concentration of the additive is less than about 2% by 

weight, based on the weight of the membrane forming 
material. 
The process of Claim 1 in which the additive 
comprises polysiloxane containing at least about 50% 

siloxane units. 
The process of Claim 6 in which the additive 
comprises an amino functional polysiloxane. 
The process of Claim 6 in which the additive 
contains reactive functional groups capable of 

crosslinking.

oxide).  
 
A process for separating a gas or vapor mixture comprising: 

(a) contacting a feed gas or vapor mixture with a multilayer composite membrane 
produced by the process comprising: 


(1) applying a thin layer of a coating solution to a substrate, said coating solution 
comprising not more than about 5 g/100ml of a polymeric material in a 

solvent system, and not more than about 20% by weight, based on the 
weight of said material, of at least one additive comprising polysiloxane, said 

material being capable of forming a membrane for the separation of gas or 
vapor mixtures; and  

 
(2) drying the thin coating layer on the substrate, thereby forming a multilayer 
composite membrane having at least one interior separation layer of the 

polymeric membrane forming material, that substantially determines the gas 
or vapor separation characteristics of the membrane, deposited on the 

substrate and an exterior protective layer of said additive over said interior 
separation layer, whereby the exterior protective layer serves to protect the 

separation layer from imperfections; and 
(b) withdrawing the more permeable component of the feed mixture from the 
multilayer composite membrane as permeate gas; and 
(c) separately recovering the less permeable component of the feed mixture from the 
multilayer composite membrane as non-permeate gas, whereby the exterior 

protective layer serves to protect the interior separation layer from imperfections, 
thereby enhancing the selectivity permeability performance capabilities of the 

membrane
