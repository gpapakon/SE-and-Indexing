<ABSTRACT>
An etch 
stop layer of chromium (24) is initially deposited on the 

circuit elements of the CMOS silicon substrate. 
Next, a conductive layer of tungsten (26) is non-selectively 

deposited on the chromium layer (24). A 
photoresist mask (28) is then lithographically patterned 

over the tungsten layer (26). The tungsten layer (26) is then 
etched down to, and stopping at, the chromium layer (24), 

after which the photoresist mask (28) is stripped. The 
stripping preferably uses a low temperature plasma 

etch in O₂ at a temperature of less than 100°C. 
Finally, a directional O₂ reactive ion etch is used 

to remove the chromium layer (24) selectively to the 
silicon substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method 
for fabricating tungsten local interconnections in 
high density CMOS circuits, and also to high density 
CMOS circuits having local interconnections formed 
of tungsten. More particularly, the subject invention pertains to 
a method for forming tungsten local interconnections 
in CMOS technology using reactive ion etching, and 
also to the high density CMOS circuits formed 
pursuant thereto. Borderless contacts are formed 
with the aid of a chromium etch stop layer beneath 
the tungsten local interconnection layer. This 
approach allows partial overlap of contacts to 
reduce device dimensions, and results in improved 
density and performance. Recent increases in packing densities for 
complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) 
transistor circuits can be directly attributed to a 
reduction in device dimen-sions. For these trends 
to continue, interconnections between devices may 
require alternatives to conventional metallization 
techniques to keep pace with the smaller feature 
sizes. One alternative method is the use oflocal 
interconnections (LI) which may be used to wire 
circuit elements over limited distances.
 
 
there is much concern regarding their manufacturability, which 
does not appear to be feasible at the present time. Non-selective methods have not received much attention in the 
prior art because of the difficulty in patterning metals over 
topography. However, it should be noted that one study 
reported the use of tungsten (W) local interconnections in 64K 
SRAM's without revealing the process details of their 
formation, P.A. Hunt, Appl. Surf. Sci., 38, 485 (1989). The difficulty in patterning metal layers using reactive ion 
etching (RIE) results from the inability to avoid removing (or 
damaging) underlying materials and circuits. For partially 
covered contacts, a silicided diffusion may be exposed on one 
portion of the wafer, while oxide isolation is exposed in 
another region thereof. Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention 
to provide a method for fabricating tungsten local 
interconnections in high density CMOS circuits, and also to 
high density CMOS circuits having local interconnections 
formed of tungsten. The subject invention provides improved etch selectivity by 
depositing a chromium etch stop layer prior to depositing the 
tungsten interconnection layer. Since this etch stop layer 
becomes part of the conductive path, it should have low 
resistivity, and also be etchable without
