<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the polymerization
of olefins using metallocenes. In still another aspect, the present invention relates to novel olefin polymers prepared
by polymerization using the metallocenes, more particularly, using bridged sandwich-bonded
metallocenes in which the bridge is a diorgano silyl bridge.It is well known that many metallocenes can be useful for the polymerization of olefins. Particularly it has been
noted that metallocenes can be combined with aluminoxanes to produce catalyst systems of high activity for the production
of polyolefins. A particularly interesting type of metallocene for olefin polymerization is the so-called bridged
sandwich-bonded metallocene in which the ligand of the metallocene comprises two cyclopentadienyl-type groups connected
through a bridging group. Some of the bridged sandwich-bonded metallocenes when used in the polymerization
of olefins having three or more carbon atoms have been found to be useful for producing polymers having different
types of microstructure as reflected by tacticity as determined by infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopic techniques. A discussion of such techniques is disclosed in Zambelli et al, J. Polym. Sci. Part C.84,
1488, (1962); Lotz et al, Macro Molecules, 21, 2375, (1988); Haftka et al, J. Macromol. Sci. Phys., 830, 319, (1991); and
Youngman et al, Macromol.Res., 2, 33 (1967). A particularly good description of the NMR technique is contained in
Chapter 3 of the book "Chain Structure and Conformation of Macromolecules" by Frank A. Bovey (Academic Press,
1982).It is well known in the art that the microstructure tacticity of a polyolefin molecule can have a significant effect
upon the physical properties of the polymer. Other things which affect the polymer properties include the type of monomer,
and comonomer if employed, the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer, the molecular weight distribution,
and the composition distribution of the resin. Accordingly, for producing commercially desirable polymers, it is
important to find metallocene catalysts which give the desired combination of polymer properties plus commercially
practical polymerisation activities.A wide range of sandwich-bonded bridged metallocenes have been at least proposed in the open literature
and the patent literature and there have been some studies of the effects of varying the structure of the ligand used in
the metallocene. One example of such a study is disclosed in the New Journal of Chemistry, Vol. 14,
