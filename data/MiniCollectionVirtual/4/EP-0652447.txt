<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus of rapidly generating horizon maps from a three 
dimensional volume of seismic traces is disclosed. During batch processing of the 

digital data representing trace wavelets, "1"'s or "0"'s are determined for each seismic 
trace of the volume. A bit volume is produced of which a "1" at a depth of a trace 

indicates that a horizon exists at that depth and at other depths of "1"'s of adjacent 
traces which are within a predetermined depth. In a real time mode, an explorationist 

selects a seed point thereby identifying a "1" on a particular trace at a particular depth. 
An automatic scanning procedure finds all other "1"'s at depths of adjacent traces. 

Each found "1" of adjacent traces is redesignated a seed point and the process is 
continued until no more "1"'s can be found. A horizon map is created from the depths 

of each found "1". An alternative method and apparatus is disclosed by which such bit 
volume is replaced with a compressed trace volume where each bit of the bit volume 

is replaced with a numerical value corresponding to the precise depth location of the 
attribute extremum represented by the bit. Such depth values are stored consecutively 

to form compressed traces. Interpolation of wavelets to find maximum or minimum 
attributes of such wavelets identifies depths above or below a bit of the bit volume 

which allows the production of an interpolated compressed trace volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of
seismic data interpretation. In particular the invention
relates to a machine process for selection of three-dimensional
(3D) seismic data to provide petroleum
exploration professionals more detailed understanding of
subsurface geology and geometry. Still more particularly,
this invention is an automated method of "picking" or
"tracking" individual seismic events or horizons through a
three-dimensional volume of data with extreme accuracy and
extreme speed.This invention is a divisional of EP-B-0 548 341 in
which there is disclosed in a method of automatically
picking horizons from a three dimensional volume of seismic
data traces, where a horizon is a bedding interface in the
earth's crust and is represented in said seismic data
traces through said bedding interface by a common attribute
of a seismic wavelet, a method of creating a compressed
trace volume comprising the steps of identifying for each
of said seismic data traces depths at which horizons
exists, and storing for each such seismic data trace a
sequence of numerical values representative of said depths
at which said horizons exist to create compressed traces of
a compressed trace volume.Figures 1 through 4 of the Drawings illustrate
features and methods associated with the prior art picking
methods; Figures 5 through 8 illustrate features and
methods of this invention. Only Figures associated with
prior art methods are introduced here. 
Figure 1 illustrates a portion of hypothetical 3D
seismic data volume in order to explain the three-dimensional
relationships discussed in the text and
accompanying drawings in this specification;Figure 2 is an isometric view of a portion of five
seismic traces which illustrates the relationship between
a "seed point" and its four adjacent traces;Figure 3 illustrates a prior art automatic tracking
method; andFigure 4 illustrates a prior art "iterative"
autotracking method.Figure 1 is an isometric view of a portion of a hypothetical three-dimensional
(3D) seismic data volume. The small circles at the top of the volume represent the
surface location of individual traces. The vertical lines represent seismic traces which
are measured in 2 way travel time along the z-axis of the volume. Such travel is
related to the distance or depth into the earth at which a wavelet is generated. Each
individual trace is an amplitude versus time representation of acoustic reflections from
strata in the earth. The graphical view of Figure 1 is merely a visual representation

A method of automatically selecting horizons of sub surface formations from
a three-dimensional volume of seismic data traces

including the steps of:

(1) selecting a seed point representative of a seismic attribute on a seismic
data trace which falls on a horizon of said sub surface formations, where a

horizon is a bedding interface in the earth's crust and is characterized in
said seismic data traces through said bedding interface by a common

attribute of a seismic wavelet, and where said common attribute may vary
in depth as a function of x-y coordinates of said seismic data traces;
(2) beginning with said seed point on said seismic data trace, identifying the
same depth as said seed point on adjacent seismic data traces.
(3) searching said adjacent traces to find a common seismic attribute within a
predetermined depth as the depth of said seed point,
(4) designating any common attribute of an adjacent trace as a found point on
the same horizon as said seed point is on, and designating such found

point on said adjacent trace as a new seed point,
(5) recording said seed point characterised by the steps of
as a parent point and recording each found point

of an adjacent trace as being a child of said parent seed point; and
(G) repeating steps (2), (3), (4) and (5) above except for search traces already
searched, until no more found points on adjacent t
