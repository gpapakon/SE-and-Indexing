<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a glove 
construction, including means for protecting the 

ligaments and articulations as well as the bones 
of the hand, which comprises a glove body (2), therewith 

is associated a plate (10) for protecting the hand 
palm, at the proximal region of the forearm, which 

is provided, at one end thereof, with an annular 
element (12) encompassing the attachment region of the 

thumb. 
To the plate there is articulated a shield (20) 
which is engaged with the forearm, tie-rods (30,40,50,60,70) being 

moreover provided connecting the fingers of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a glove
construction, provided with means for protecting
the ligaments and articulations of the hand.There are already available on the market
several types of protective gloves, for very different
applications, which gloves, however, usually exclusively
protect the surface of the hand by using
suitable materials or by possible paddings, for
cushioning the impacts.In particular, the sport use gloves, such
as, for example, the ski gloves, are made of a padding
material which, at first, has a thermal protective
function and, moreover, being provided for protecting
the user hand against impacts.However, these prior gloves have not been
found to properly protect the ligaments and articulations
of the hand, for example as a skier falls and,
in the case of violent falling, frequently occur
lesions of the ligaments and dislocations of the
hand articulations, as well as fractures of the hand
bones.In fact, as a skier falls against the ground,
he/she usually lays the palm of his/her hand against 
the soil, thereby causing the mentioned lesions of
the ligaments or bones.In fact, under such a condition, the fingers
are bent, with respect to the palm, beyond an allowable
bending angle.Likewise a falling skier may also be subjected
to luxations and fractures at the region of
his/her wrist.Accordingly, the aim of the present invention
is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks,
by providing a glove construction, including means
for protecting the ligaments, articulations and
bones of the hand, which is suitable to properly
protect the hand ligaments, articulations and bones
while preventing in the case of a violent impact
against the soil, the fingersfrom being bent beyond
a natural allowable bending angle, so as to reduce
the impact force against the wrist.Within the scope of the above mentioned
aim, a main object of the present invention is to
provide such a glove construction which, while including
very efficient protecting means, can be
easily worn likewise a conventional glove and which, 
moreover, does not hinder the wearer during the
conventional use time.Another object of the present invention is
to provide such a glove construction which, owing
to its particular constructional feature, is very
reliable and safe in operation.Yet another object of the present invention
is to provide such a glove construction which can
be made starting from easily available elements
and materials and which, moreover, is very competitive
from a mere economic standpoint.According to one aspect
