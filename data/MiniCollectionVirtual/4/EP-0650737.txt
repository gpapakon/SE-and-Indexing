<ABSTRACT>
In a blood plasma filtration method including a primary filtering for separating blood into corpuscule and 
plasma, and a secondary filtering for cleaning the separated plasma by removing harmful macromolecular substances 

therefrom, the cleaning of the secondary filter is done by introducing a cleaning liquid the quantity of which corresponds 
to 5-50 % of the priming volume of the filter into an inner chamber or an outer chamber or both thereof in the filter 

every time a filtration pressure reaches 70-100 % of the resistible pressure of the filter. This enables the time required 
to carry out the filtration of blood plasma to be reduced to about 60-70 % of that in a conventional method of this kind, 

the patient binding hour to be reduced, and the quantity of a cleaning liquid or blood plasma discharged wastefully to 
the outside of the system to be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
washing a secondary filter in a process for filtering 
plasma. The plasma filtration processes include 
so-called double filtration plasmapheresis by which the 
substance to be removed is selected according to the pore 
size of a secondary filter, and so-called cryofiltration 
for removing pathogenic substances from plasma by a 
secondary filter with cooling. In either of these 
processes, continued filtration of plasma tends to 
gradually clog the secondary filter, so that it is 
necessary to eliminate clogging in the course of 
filtration. There are two methods of eliminating clogging; 
one is replacement of the secondary filter by another 
one, and the other is washing the secondary filter with 
physiological saline or the like. The latter is used 
generally since the secondary filter is expensive. As a method of washing the secondary filter, it 
is already proposed to wash the filter with a wash liquor  
 
in an amount approximately equal to the priming volume of 
the filter to ten-odd times the volume when the 
filtration pressure has reached 60% of the withstanding 
pressure of the secondary filter (maximum pressure to 
withstand the filtration pressure with safety), for 
example, 300 mm Hg (e.g., Tetsuzo Agishi et al., "Double 
Filtration Plasmapheresis," published by Igaku Shoin). 
However, the conventional washing method which consumes a 
large amount of wash liquor approximately equal to the 
priming volume to ten-odd times the volume gives rise to 
the problem of resulting in a greatly reduced filtration 
efficiency to necessitate much time for removing the 
pathogenic substance from plasma because every time the 
secondary filter is washed, the interior of the filter is 
entirely replaced by the wash liquor with the cake almost 
completely washed away by washing. The term filtration 
efficiency as used herein refers to the rate of removal 
of the substance per unit time. For example, in the case 
of cryofiltration wherein usually 2 to 4 liters of plasma 
needs to be treated in circulation, the time taken is as 
long as about 4 hours in total including the time 
required for washing the secondary filter, and the 
patient must be placed under restraint during this 
period. It is desired to shorten the time. The main object of the present invention is to 
provide a method of washing a secondary filter in a 
process for filtering plasma, the method being adapted to 
shorten the time required for the filtration of plasma. Another object of the present
