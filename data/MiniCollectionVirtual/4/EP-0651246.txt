<ABSTRACT>
A cartridge for accurate reproduceful analytical 
solution evaluation is described. The cartridge includes 

sensors in an array within a test chamber. The number of 
sensors is one more than the number of substances to be 

measured. The cartridge is miniaturised and receivable 
within a compact instrument adapted for field use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to analytical measurement 
of solutions and, particularly, to a method for 
referenceless sensor measurement employing single point 
calibration The traditional "wet" chemistry techniques in 
analytical chemistry and its more sophisticated progeny, 
clinical chemistry, have in recent decades been replaced 
by electronic instrumentation. With the advent of 
instrumentaton, accuracy in reproducibility of 
experimental measurements has been enhanced. Such 
accuracy is of particular importance in clinical chemical 
techniques and of the greatest importance in biomedical 
measurements where minute (part per million) measurements 
are common. Linking such instrumentation and automated 
processing with the microprocessors and affordable 
computer technology, has resulted in another step in the 
evolution of analytical and clinical chemical techniques. In the sub-discipline of electro-chemical 
measurements, great advances in such instrumentation have 
been made. Generally, conventional electro-chemical  
 
measurements require the measurement of two sample 
solutions containing two different known concentrations 
of a substance for calibration purposes followed by 
measurement of a solution containing an unknown quantity 
of the species. Electro-chemical methods generally 
require use of a reference electrode, a substance 
specific electrode and a bridge between the solution in 
order to achieve a cell for potentiometric 
measurements. The electrical signal (commonly in 
millivolts) obtained from the cell is proportional to 
the ionic activity and, therefore, concentration of the 
substance in the solution. The signal/concentration 
relationship is algebraically expressible by a Nernst 
equation

V = Mf[C]+I+J   (1) 


 
where 
Vis the voltage (signal) Mfis the slope (a constant for the 
particular electrode and substance) Iis a constant for a particular substance Jis the junction potential of the cell [C]is the ionic activity (concentration of 
the substance). In order to establish the values necessary to 
solve the equation, it is first required to determine the 
slope, Mf, for the electrode. For this step, measurement  
 
of two solutions containing known concentrations are 
taken, the values inputted into the above equation and 
the equations solved simultaneously to obtain the slope. 
Next, it is necessary to determine the constant, I, for 
the particular substance in solution relative to the 
particular electrode. The junction potential is also 
determined by conventional methods.
