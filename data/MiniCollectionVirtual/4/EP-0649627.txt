<ABSTRACT>
Tunnel-type dishwashing machine including a device (3) for automatically advancing (progressing) the dish trays, which comprises two spaced-apart parallel endless chains (4) each one passing over at least two sprockets (6) so as to travel through the tunnel (1) along its entire length, the upper length of these two chains (4) receiving the dish trays for the purpose of progressing them through adherence on the chains, as well as driving means (8 to 12) for the said chains. The sprockets (6) for the two chains (4) are mounted on a rectangular frame (13) formed of two longitudinal members and of crossmembers connecting the two longitudinal members together, the frame passing right through the tunnel (1) of the machine being articulated (at 17) by one of its longitudinal members to the supporting structure of the machine so that it can be lifted up through pivoting.

Tunnel type dishwashing machine comprising a 
device (3) for automatically advancing racks of dishes 

characterised in that the automatic advance device (3) is 
mounted on a rectangular frame (13) formed of two 

longitudinal members (14) and crossmembers (15) linking 
the two longitudinal members, this frame passing entirely 

through the tunnel (1) of the machine being hinged by one 
longitudinal member to the frame of the machine so that 

it can be raised by pivoting it. 
Machine according to claim 1 characterised in 
that locking means are provided for immobilising the 

pivoting frame in the raised position. 
Machine according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that locking means are provided for 

immobilising the pivoting frame in the lowered position. 
Machine according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the automatic advance device (3) 

comprises two spaced parallel endless chains (4) each 
passing over at least two sprockets (5, 6) so as to run 

through the entire length of the tunnel (1), the upper 
run of the two chains (4) receiving the racks of dishes 

to advance them by virtue of adhesion to the chains and 
drive means (8 to 12) for said chains. 
Machine according to claim 4 characterised in 
that two sprockets (6) of the chains at one longitudinal 

end of the frame (13) are mounted on a common shaft (7) 
carrying a driven toothed sprocket (8) which in the 

lowered position of the frame is engaged with a drive 
toothed sprocket (9) mounted at a fixed position on the 

frame of the machine. 
Machine according to claim 5 characterised in 
that the toothed sprockets (8 and 9) are spur tooth 

sprockets.
