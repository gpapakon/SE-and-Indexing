<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser for dispensing tablets one at a time from an unarranged stock of tablets in the dispenser. The dispenser comprises a first reservoir part axially displaceable in a second reservoir part against the force of a spring (4). A trough shaped part (5, 6) at the inner end of the first part forms with a partition (13) at the bottom of the second part a downward closed channel accommodating at least two tablets when the dispenser is in its neutral position. When the dispenser is operated by forcing the first part further into the second part, a bottom (7) closing the channel is passed free of the partition (13) and the lowermost tablet is dispensed. At the same time two fingers (9) are passed into the space left at the sides of the channel between the lowermost tablet and the adjacent tablet above it to ensure that only the lowermost tablet is dispensed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dispensers for pills or tablets in which dispenser 
pills or tablets are stored among each other in a non-ordered way, and from which 
they are dispensed one at a time when the dispenser is operated. A dispenser comprising the features of the first part of claim 1 
having an outer and an inner telescopic part is known from US-A-4,854,478. 
From a reservoir tablets are guided into a separating channel formed by 
a trough closed at its lower end by a discharge plate and carried by the outer part. 
The open side of the trough is closed at its lower end by a wall carried by the inner 
part. When the two parts are telescoped in relation to each other, the lower end of 
the trough is lowered in relation to the wall carried by the inner part so that the side 
of the channel is opened and the lower tablet in this channel may drop out. Further, 
the wall of the inner part will press a wall of the outer part 
partly into the channel so that the tablet 
immediately above the lower one will be caught by being jammed in the channel. It is an object of the invention to provide a dispenser in which one pill or 
tablet at a time is separated from a batch of tablets stored in a reservoir, without 
affecting the tablets by forces which may crush them. This is obtained according to claim 1 by a dispenser comprising an inner part forming a reservoir 
for pills or tablets and having at its one end a depending trough shaped to 
accommodate at least two tablets or pills abutting each other at their periphery, an 
outer part into which said inner part fits telescopically displaceable between a neutral 
and a dispensing position and with its trough end first, said outer part having at its 
end a partition forming with the trough of the inner part a channel having a first end 
opening into the reservoir and a second end facing a dispensing opening, an end 
wall provided at the end of the trough corresponding to the second end of the channel, 
which wall adjoins the lower end of 
the partition when the inner part is in its neutral position and is passed beyond the 
partition to open a passage from the second end of the channel to the dispensing 
opening when the inner part is in its dispensing position, in which position an element 
enters the channel to block the passage for tablets and allow only the tablet adjacent  
 
to the dispensing opening to be dispensed, which dispenser is according to the 
invention characterized in that as element two fingers are suspended at the outside of the inner 
part and

<CLAIMS>
A dispenser for pills or tablets stored in a non-ordered way in the 
dispenser from which they are dispensed one at a time, which dispenser comprises 

an inner part forming a reservoir for pills or tablets and having at its one end a 
depending trough (5,6) shaped to accommodate at least two tablets or pills abutting 

each other at their periphery, an outer part into which said inner part fits telescopically 
displaceable between a neutral and a dispensing position and with its trough 

end first, said outer part having at its end a partition (13) forming with the trough 
(5,6) of the inner part a channel having a first end opening into the reservoir and a 

second end facing a dispensing opening (14), an end wall (7) provided at the 
end of the trough (5,6) corresponding to the second end of the channel, 

which wall (7) adjoins the lower end of the partition 
(13) when the inner part is in its neutral position and is passed beyond the partition 

(13) to open a passage from the second end of the channel to the dispensing 
opening (14) when the inner part is in its dispensing position, in which position 

an element (9) enters the channel to block the passage for tablets and allow only the tablet 
adjacent to the dispensing opening (14) to be dispensed, 
characterized
 in that as element two 
fingers (9) are suspended at the outside of the inner part and protrude into 

openings (8) in the bottom (5) of the trough (5,6) perpendicular to this bottom and 
adjacent to the side walls (6) of the trough and positioned in a distance from the end 

wall (7) corresponding to the diameter of the pills or tablets to be dispensed, and 
that a ramp (12) is provided at the inside of the outer part to affect the fingers (9) 

or their suspension (10) to make the fingers (9), which are in the neutral position of 
the inner part relative to the outer part flush with the bottom (5) of the trough, 

protrude into the trough (5,6) into the space left between two neighbouring pills or tablets 
in the channel when the inner part is telescoped further into the outer part. 
A dispenser according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the inner part 
has a bottom wall (3) inclining downwards towards and adjoining the upper end of 

the partition (13) in the neutral position.  
 
A dispenser according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that a spring 
(4) is provided urging the inner part towards its neutral position. 
A dispenser according to claim 3,
 characterized
 in that the inner part 
inclusive the spring (4) and the beam (10) with the fingers (9) is moulded as one 

integral part. 
A dispenser according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized
 
in that it is so designed that it cannot be left standing up.
