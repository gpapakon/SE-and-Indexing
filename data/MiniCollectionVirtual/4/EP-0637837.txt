<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thin film transistor, more 
particularly to a method for fabricating hydrogen embrittled 
amorphous thin film transistors which can improve performance 
and productivity of elements by forming the semiconductor 
layers with atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition 
method. Thin film transistors are elements widely used for 
switching elements of liquid crystal displays, wherein a thin 
film transistor switches a liquid crystal display by 
controlling current flowing between the source/drain according 
to the voltage applied to the gate electrode. A thin film transistor mostly uses polycrystal silicon 
film or amorphous silicon film for the semiconductor layer, 
and for resistive contact i.e., ohmic contact between the 
semiconductor layer and the source/drain electrodes, a 
semiconductor layer having impurity ions injected therein is 
provided between the semiconductor layer and the source/drain 
regions.  FIGs.1(a) to 1(f) show conventional processes for 
fabricating a staggered, hydrogen embrittled amorphous thin 
film transistor. A first metal film is deposited on a cleaned glass 
substrate 1, which is subjected to a patterning with 
photoetching process to form source/drain electrodes 2 and 3 
as shown in FIG.1(a). For ohmic contact, a semiconductor layer 6 serving as an 
active layer is formed over the source/drain electrodes 2 and 
3 by forming a high density n+ type amorphous silicon film 
doped with phosphor(n+ a-Si) 4 on the exposed surfaces of the 
patterned source/drain electrodes 2 and 3 as shown in 
FIG.1(b), depositing a hydrogen embrittled amorphous 
silicon(s-Si:H) film 5 on all over the using a PECVD(Plasma 
Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition) equipment as shown in 
FIG.1(c), and patterning the hydrogen embrittled amorphous 
silicon film(FIG.1(d)). Then, finally a conventional staggered thin film 
transistor can be formed by forming a gate insulation film 7 
on all over the surface(FIG.1(e)), forming a second metal film 
on the gate insulation film 7, and carrying out patterning of 
the second metal film with a photoetching process to form a 
gate electrode 8 on the gate insulation film 7 over the active 
layer 6(FIG.1(f)).  However, in the foregoing conventional method for 
fabricating a thin film transistor, the active layer 6 has 
been formed by depositing a hydrogen embrittled amorphous 
silicon using a PECVD equipment at a temperature lower than 
that of the gate insulation film 7, i.e., the forming 
temperature of the gate insulation film 7 is
