<ABSTRACT>
A clamping jaw (10) for a clamping device, adapted to be mounted on a profile member (31) is formed by two separate jaw members (11) and a common rear counter support (12) for said members, which is arranged to transmit clamping forces produced by means of clamping bolts (32) to the two jaw members (11). The jaw members (11) and the counter support (12) have cooperating engagement means (13, 15) for placing and holding the jaw members (11) in predetermined positions in relation to the counter support (12). In order to make it possible to adapt the clamping jaw (10) to profile members of different shape and size, the engagement means (13, 15) are arranged to permit each jaw member (11) to be placed and held in a plurality of different positions in relation to the counter support (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clamping jaw. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
clamping jaw for application under pressure against a 
profile member. Clamping devices comprising such clamping jaws 
are utilized as attachment means for profile members 
of many different kinds. For instance, they are utilized 
in connection with the attachment of profile members 
to buildings or the like and for mounting antennas on 
such members. Normally, the clamping device comprises 
two opposite clamping jaws, which may be applied under 
pressure against mutually opposite sides of a profile 
member by means of two clamping bolts placed each on 
one side of said member. However, in some cases, one 
clamping jaw may be replaced by a fixed building portion 
or the like, in which the two clamping bolts are anchored 
in a suitable manner. In most clamping devices of the above kind previously 
known, the clamping jaw or each clamping jaw, respectively, 
is formed by a member, made in one single piece 
and having a shape and size adapted to the intended profile 
member. However, through U.S. patent specification 
No. 4 444 370, it is also known, in a clamping device 
of said kind, to utilize a clamping jaw formed by two 
separate jaw members and a common elongate counter support 
for said jaw members, located behind them and arranged 
to transmit clamping forces applied on the counter support 
to the two jaw members in order to hold the jaw members 
in contact under pressure against the profile member. 
The two jaw members and the counter support are provided 
with cooperating engagement means for placing and holding 
the jaw members in predetermined positions in relation 
to the counter support.  
 According to said patent specification, the main 
reason for dividing a clamping jaw into three different 
portions, namely two separate jaw members and a common 
rear counter support for said members, is to facilitate 
the manufacture as well as the use of the clamping jaw 
when it has very large dimensions and forms part of a 
clamping device for pipes of very large diameter. A disadvantage of the clamping jaw disclosed in 
the above-mentioned U.S. patent specification as well 
as of an ordinary clamping jaw, made in one single piece, 
is that the clamping jaw is suited to be mounted only 
on profile members having dimensions and shapes varying 
within rather narrow limits. Therefore, in order to meet 
the need for clamping devices for various kinds of 
profile members of strongly varying size and shape, it

<CLAIMS>
Clamping jaw for application under pressure against 
a profile member (31), said clamping jaw (10) being 

formed by two separate jaw members (11) and a common 
elongate counter support (12) for said jaw members, 

located at one side of them and arranged to transmit clamping 
forces applied on the counter support (12) to the two 

jaw members (11) in order to hold the jaw members (11) 
in contact under pressure against said profile member 

(31), the jaw members (11) and the counter support (12) 
being provided with cooperating engagement means (13, 15) 

for placing and holding the jaw members (11) in predetermined 
positions in relation to the counter support 

(12), characterized in that said engagement means (13, 15) 
comprise rows of alternating projections (13, 15) and 

recesses (14, 16) which are provided at surfaces of 
the jaw members (11) and the counter support (12) that 

are facing each other and which are arranged to permit 
the two jaw members (11) to be placed and held at a 

stepwise variable distance from each other as seen in 
the longitudinal direction of the counter support (12). 
Clamping jaw according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the engagement means (13, 15) are formed so 

as to permit the jaw members (11) to be placed and held 
in positions in which they are facing each other with 

first ends (17) thereof, as well as in reversed positions 
in which they are facing each other with second 

ends (18) thereof, opposite to the first ends (17). 
Clamping jaw according to claim 2, characterized 
in that, at their said first and second ends (17, 18), 

the jaw members (11) are provided with contact surfaces 
(19, 20) of mutually different shape for application 

against a profile member (31). 
Clamping jaw according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the engagement means

side of each jaw member (11) and cooperating transverse 
teeth (15) at the front side of the counter support (12). 
Clamping jaw according to claim 4, characterized 
in that, at its front side, the counter support (12 is 

provided with two flanges (21), projecting in a forward 
direction therefrom and forming a pair of opposite longitudinal 

guide surfaces (22) for two opposite longitudinal 
lateral surfaces (23) of each jaw member (11). 
Clamping jaw according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises locking means
