<ABSTRACT>
The temperature-controlled switching device has a tilting system (1) which consists of a carrier (2) and a switching rocker (3). A drive element (18), whose y-position is a function of the temperature of a sensor (28), acts with a force (K) onto a drive surface (6) on the carrier (2) such that the tilting system (1) can be tilted from an ON position into an OFF position and such that the direction of the tilting movement from the ON position to the OFF position is opposite to the force (K) which acts on the drive surface (6). A fracture safety spring (24) is mounted such that it initiates a tilting movement into the OFF position in the event of any leakage from the temperature sensor (28), which is filled with an expanding material. If designed as a temperature limiter, the tilting system (1) is reset from the OFF position to the ON position by a resetting plunger (26), from the same side as the drive by the drive element (18). Electrical connecting male contacts (16b; 21b; 22b; 30b) are arranged on the side opposite the drive element (18). Such a temperature-controlled switching device is suitable for use as a temperature regulator, temperature monitor or temperature limiter, designed with or without safety functions such as fracture safety or operating safety.

A temperature-controlled switching device comprising a tilt 
system (1) which is arranged on a base plate (17) and which includes a 

carrier (2) provided with a first knife-edge mounting (4) and a second 
parallel knife-edge mounting (5), and a switching rocker (3) with a 

rocker contact portion (13), wherein the switching rocker (3) is in 
the form of a leaf spring (10) with an opening (12) and a tongue (11), 

is suspended with the opening (12) in the first knife-edge mounting 
(4) of the carrier (2) and is supported with the free end of the 

tongue (11) in the second knife-edge mounting (5), and wherein the 
rocker contact portion (13) with a first contact portion (19) forms an 

electrical switch, and further comprising a drive element (18) which 
is controlled by a temperature sensor (28) filled with an expansion 

substance, characterised in that the second knife-edge mounting (5) is 
movable relative to the first knife-edge mounting (4) along a y-axis 

(9), that the tilt system (1) is tiltable from an ON-position into an 
OFF-position by the action of a force on a drive surface (6) on the 

carrier (2), and that the direction of the tilt movement from the ON-position 
into the OFF-position is opposite to the force (K) acting on 

the drive surface (6). 
A temperature-controlled switching device according to claim 1 
and including a fail-safe device characterised in that the fail-safe 

device comprises a spring (24) and an adjusting screw (25) and that 
the adjusting screw (25) bears against the drive element (18) in such 

a way that upon a loss of the expansion substance due to a leak in the 
temperature sensor (28) the spring (24) presses against the tongue 

(11) with a predetermined force so that the tilt system (1) tilts into 
the OFF-position. 
A temperature-controlled switching device according to claim 1 
or claim 2 characterised in that the carrier (2) comprises the alloy 

CuNi9Sn2.  
 
A temperature-controlled switching device according to one of 
claims 1 to 3 characterised in that the switching rocker (3) comprises 

the alloy CuZn23Al3.5Co or the alloy CuSn1Ni1CrTi. 
A temperature-controlled switching device according to one of 
claims 1 to 4 characterised in that the temperature-controlled 

switching device is a temperature limiter, that the relative positions 
of the first knife-edge mounting (4), the first contact portion (19) 

and a second contact portion (20) which with the rocker contact 

portion (13) in the OFF-position forms an electrical contact are so 
predetermined and that the possibility of movement of the second 

knife-edge mounting (5) with respect to the first knife-edge mounting 
(4) is so restricted, that in the OFF-position the switching point OFF 

→ ON (y
s2
) of the tilt system (1) lies outside the range of movement 
of the second knife-edge mounting (5). 
A temperature-controlled switching device according to claim 5 
characterised in that the spacing (b) of the second contact portion 

(20) from the first contact portion (19) is so great and that the 
return spring force of the carrier (2) and the force component of the 

tongue (11) of the switching rocker (3) in the direction of the y-axis 
(9) are in relationship of such magnitudes that in the OFF-position 

the drive location (6) of the carrier (2) is disengaged from the drive 
element (18). 
A temperature-controlled switching device according to claim 5 
or claim 6 with a reset thrust member (26) and with a stop means (29) 

characterised in that the first contact portion (19) is mounted on a 
metal strip (21) which is resiliently fixed to the base plate (17) and 

presses with a predetermined force against the stop means (29), and 
that the reset thrust member (26) is provided with two steps so that 

upon being actuated the reset thrust member (26) presses against the  
 

metal strip (21) and against the switching rocker (3) in such a way 
that the electrical contact between the rocker contact portion (13) of 

the switching rocker (3) and the first contact portion (19) is 
interrupted during the reset operation.
