<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cylinder lock and an associated key. The latter has the features that at least three control grooves are provided on at least one of the two side surfaces, at least one of the control grooves is designed to be deeper than the other control grooves, and the two shallow control grooves are provided such that they run approximately parallel to one another, characterised in that a further cutout (domed milled relief 22) for releasing the control slide 11 is provided on at least one of the flat sides, and in that, at least on a key front (key spine), there is arranged an oblique profiling which meshes with an analogous profiling of a profiled strip arranged in the cylinder lock.

Cylinder lock provided with control units including control means 
projecting into a key channel, scanning the control grooves of a key 

inserted into the key channel, with one control unit including two 
control devices being provided at least on one side of the key channel, 

arranged approximately parallel to the same, with the said means 
extending with a first longitudinal extension through a slot in 

the cylinder core to the key channel in order to co-act with the 
low-level control grooves of a key inserted into the key channel and 

with at least one more control unit including a control device being 
provided on the same side of the key channel, extending by a second 

longitudinal extension through another slot in the cylinder core to 
the key channel in order to co-act with the deep control groove of a 

key inserted into the key channel, with the first longitudinal extension 
being smaller than the second longitudinal extension and 

with at least one locking mechanism being provided which can be put 
into a release position for rotating the cylinder core in relation 

to a cylinder sleeve based on an appropriate position of the control 
units, characterized in that the locking mechanism is a locking slide 

(8) displaceable in a recess of the cylinder core (3), including 
locking units (9), projecting into a groove (35) of the cylinder 

sleeve (1) when the cylinder core is not rotated and with the cylinder 
sleeve including open annular grooves (6) facing the cylinder 

core into which locking units (9) enter when the cylinder core is 
rotated, with any further rotation being allowed. 
Cylinder lock according to claim 1, characterized in that a control 
slide (11) is arranged in a cylinder core (3) arranged in a 

displaceable way in the cylinder core due to a control recess (20) 
of the sleeve and including a shoulder area (12) through which the 

locking slide (8) is displaceable, with one end of the control slide 
(11) engaging into a recess (a spherical cut-out 22) of the key. 
Cylinder lock according to claim 1, characterized in that a  
 

locking slide (50) is arranged in a cylinder core (3), being an integral 
part of the control slide (51) and displaceable in radial direction 

in a recess (7) of the cylinder core (3), with the end of 
the control slide (51) engaging in a recess (spherical cut-out 22) 

of the key and with the locking slide including an engaging extension 
(52), engaging in an axial groove of the cylinder sleeve and 

extendible from the same in radial direction against the compression 
of a spring w
hen rotating the cylidner core, thus allowing further 
rotation of the cylinder sleeve. 
Cylinder lock according to claim 1 or 3, characterized in that a 
contoured strip is provided in a cylinder core (3) along a key channel, 

displaceable in radial direction, controlled by stop recesses 
(31) in the cylinder sleeve and including a countour (28) engaging 

in a corresponding contour on the back of the key. 
Cylinder lock according to claim 4, characterized in that a contour 
(28) is provided in oblique direction to the longitudinal central 

plane of a contoured strip (fig. 9). 
Flat key to release a control slide, wherein the key includes 
control grooves on its sides, the spacing of which is variable in 

relation to the back of the key and possibly additional control units, 
such as indentations in the web of the key, for locking pins, 

control areas on the back of the key and longitudinal ribs and grooves 
in inserting direction of the key, with a minimum of three control 

grooves being provided on at least one of the two side areas, 
with at least one control groove being deeper than the other control 

grooves and the two shallow control grooves being arranged approximately 
parallel to each other, characterized in that on at least one 

of the two side areas at least one recess (spherical cut-out 22) is 
provided to release a control slide (11) and with at least one key 

front (key back) having a shoulder engaging in an identical contour 
of a contoured strip arranged in the cylinder lock.  

 
Flat key according to claim 6, characterized in that a spherical 
cut-out (22) is provided on both flat sides of the key, having a 

depth approaching nearly the central longitudinal plane of the key, 
with only a thin web of the key material being provided in the area 

of the greatest approximation of the said spherical cut-outs. 
Flat key according to one of claims 6 or 7, characterized in that 
the height (44) of the spherical cut-out is more than 50% of the key 

shaft height (45). 
Flat key according to one of claims 6 to 8, characterized in that 
the tip of the key includes a conventional dovetailed recess (47) 

and with the basic positions of all control units (39, 40) being 
arranged symmetrically to the longitudinal symmetrical plane (48). 
Flat key according to one of claims 6 to 9, characterized in 
that the key is designed as a reversible key.
