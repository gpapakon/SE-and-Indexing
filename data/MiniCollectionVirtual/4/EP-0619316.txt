<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a novel xanthine Compound(I) 

wherein R¹ and R² are the same or different and each 
represent hydroxy-substituted, oxo-substituted or 

unsubstituted lower alkyl, Y is a single bond or alkylene, 
and Q is 


wherein R³ and R⁴ are the same or different and each 
represent hydrogen or hydroxy, n is 0 or 1; provided that 

when both of R³ and R⁴ are hydrogen, at least one of R¹ and 
R² is hydroxy-substituted or oxo-substituted lower alkyl; 

or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. 
The xanthine compound has adenosine A₁ receptor 
antagonizing activity, and thus shows diuretic effect, 

renal-protecting effect, bronchodilatory effect, cerebral 
function improving effect and anti-dementia effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to xanthine derivatives
or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having
adenosine A1 receptor antagonizing activity, and thus
exhibiting a diuretic effect, a renal-protecting effect, a
bronchodilatory effect, a cerebral function improving effect,
and an anti-dementia effect.In relation to the compounds of the present invention,
8-(1-adamantyl)-1,3,7-trimethylxanthine is disclosed in
Tetrahedron Letters, 27, 6337 (1986). However, nothing is
mentioned on its pharmacological effect in the literature.Also, it is known that a xanthine derivative
represented by the formula

(wherein RA and RB are lower alkyl, YA is a single bond or
alkylene, and na is 0 or 1) selectively antagonizes the
adenosine A1 receptor and thus shows a renal-protecting
effect, and a bronchodilatory effect (Japanese
Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 173889/91); and
cerebral function improving effect (Japanese Published
Unexamined Patent Application No. 270222/92). Further, it
is known that a xanthine derivative represented by the
formula
 
(wherein RC and RD are hydroxy-substituted or unsubstituted
lower alkyl, and RE is substituted or unsubstituted
tricycloalkyl of C7 - C12) shows an anti-ulcerative effect,
etc. (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No.
58913/93), but no specific examples of the hydroxy-substituted
xanthine derivatives are disclosed in the
publication.It is also known that a xanthine derivative represented
by the formula

(wherein, RF and RG are the same or different, and each
represent hydroxy-substituted or unsubstituted lower alkyl
and RH is dihydroxyalkyl or

[wherein, X is O, S or NRP (wherein RP is hydrogen, lower
alkyl or lower acyl), ma and nb are the same or different
and each represent an integer of from 1 to 5]) shows a central
nervous system stimulating effect (US Patent No. 4755517).
It is known that a xanthine derivative represented by the
formula

(wherein, RJ is methyl, ethyl or propyl, RK is 2-hydroxypropyl,
and RL is methyl or propyl) shows 
an antiallergic effect (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent
Application No. 79296/79) and that a xanthine derivative
represented by the formula

[wherein at least one of RM and RO is (ω-1)-hydroxyalkyl
having from three to eight carbon atoms, or when only one of
RM and RO is (ω-1)-hydroxyalkyl, the other is hydrogen or
lower alkyl, and RN is lower alkyl] reduces
nephrotoxicity (Japanese Published Unexamined Patent
Application No. 90028/91).In EP-A-0 501 379, EP-A-0 560 354 and EP-A-0 541 120
