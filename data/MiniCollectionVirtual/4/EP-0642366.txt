<ABSTRACT>
A device for mechanically generating inhalable active substance particles from a consolidated medicament supply and for leading the active substance particles into the respiratory tract is characterized by having a drivable face mill for generating the active substance particles and against which the front side of a medicament supply in the form of a ring-shaped body can be pressed. The ring-shaped body forms the beginning of an inhalation tube which ends in a mouthpiece. The housing which encloses the ring-shaped body and the face mill is provided with air inlet openings in the area of the cutting of the face mill. Together with the depressions located between the blades and with the inhalation tube, the air inlet openings form an air channel that leads to the mouthpiece.

<CLAIMS>
Device for mechanically generating inhalable active substance particles by milling off 
material from a ring-shaped and compacted drug reservoir (5) by means of a rotatable 

dosing device with an air duct that leads from the area of the dosing device to a mouth 
piece (3) that forms the final part of an inhalation tube (2); the device shows the 

following special characteristics: the dosing device is a face mill (1) with drive, against 
which the front surface of the ring-shaped drug reservoir (5) can be pressed, and the ring-shaped 

drug reservoir (5) itself and the face mill (1) form the air duct to the mouth piece 
(3), and the ring body (5) and the face mill (1) are surrounded by a casing, and the casing 

(3, 18) is provided with air inlet openings (8) in the area of the cutting edges (17) of the 
face mill (1), whereby the air inlet openings (8), the identations (9) between the cutting 

edges (17) of the face mill (1) and the inhalation tube (2) form the air duct leading to the 
mouth piece (3). 
Device as per claim 1 with the special characteristic that the inhalation tube (2) together 
with the ring body (5) is pressed on the face mill (1) by means of a defined contact 

pressure spring (6). 
Device as per claim 2 with the special characteristic that the stroke of the inhalation tube 
(2) with the drug reservoir (5) can be limited. 
Device as per the claims 2 and 3 with the special characteristic that the ring body (5) is 
arranged in such a way that it can be replaced together with the inhalation tube (2). 
Device as per one of the claims 2 to 4 with the special characteristic that the inhalation 
tube (2) is equipped with a key-type identification that is adjusted to a certain drug 

respectively. 
Device as per one of the claims 2 to 5 with the special characteristic that the rotation 
movement of the face mill (1) is realized by means of a spring drive.  

 
Device as per claim 6 with the special characteristic that the number of rotations of the 
face mill (1) can be predetermined. 
Device as per claim 6 or 7 with the special characteristic that the indentations (9) before 
and behind the cutting edges (17) of the face mill (1) have the closest cross section of the 

entire flow path (21).
