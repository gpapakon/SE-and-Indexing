<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rapamycin derivatives,
pharmaceutical compositions comprising such derivatives,
and methods of treatment of pathogenic fungi, methods of
inducing immunosuppression and methods of treating
carcinogenic tumors utilizing such rapamycin
derivatives.Rapamycin is a naturally occurring macrocyclic
triene antibiotic which can be produced by culturing an
organism in an aqueous nutrient medium. Its structure
may be illustrated as follows:
At least one rapamycin-producing strain of
Streptomyces hygroscopius was deposited with the
Northern Utilization and Research Division, Agricultural
Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Peoria, Illinois, U.S.A. under accession number NRRL
5491. Rapamycin, and methods for its preparation by
culturing NRRL 5491 are disclosed by U.S. Patent
3,929,992, issued December 30, 1975, the entire
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.This invention relates to novel rapamycin
derivatives of the formula:

(a) one of X and Y is H, but X and Y are not both H, and;(b) when Y is -OR10, then R10 is other than H or CH3;
and all pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates or
solvates thereof.This invention also relates to a pharmaceutical
composition comprising an effective amount of one or
more compounds of Formula II and a pharmaceutically
acceptable carrier or diluent.This invention also relates to a method of
inhibiting the growth of pathogenic fungi in a human or
other animal in need thereof which comprises
