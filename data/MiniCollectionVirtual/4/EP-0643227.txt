<ABSTRACT>
A turbomolecular stage positioned at the inlet end of the pump and 
comprising a stator (6) formed from an array of stationary blades (7) 

and a rotor (8) 
formed from a further array of blades (8) arranged for rotation at 

high speed between the stator blades (7), and
 

a molecular drag stage positioned at the outlet (high pressure) end 
of the 

pump and comprising at least two discs (14,15,16,17) arranged for 
rotation within a stator (9) 

with a minimal clearance between the circumferential edge of the discs 
(14,15,16,17) and 

the stator (9), a flow passageway linking the turbomolecular stage with 
annular 

channels defined between the stator and opposing faces of the discs, and 
means for deflecting gas being pumped from the annular channels during 

rotation of the discs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in those types of vacuum pump known 
as turbomolecular pumps, and more particularly relates to a "hybrid" or 
compound pump having a turbomolecular stage and a stage of different 
operational mode for improving the operating range of pressures and 
throughput. A standard turbomolecular pump includes a rotor comprising arrays of (normally) 
angled blades arranged for rotation at high speed, for example up to sixty 
thousand revolutions per minute, between alternately arranged arrays of 
stationary blades of a stator; generally the blades of the stator are inclined in the 
opposite direction to those of the rotor. In such pumps, gas is received from a 
high vacuum chamber, compressed and delivered to a backing pump inlet, 
normally that of a two stage rotary pump. The backing pump is required in that 
the turbomolecular pump normally operates with exhaust pressure up to about 
10⁻¹ mbar and the use of the backing pump can provide backing pressures in 
this region and deliver pumped gas to the atmosphere. Compound pumps are known in which the turbomolecular stage and a further 
stage are present in a single pump. The further stage may, for example, be a 
screw rotor stage or a spiral groove stage or certain types of other molecular 
drag stage. Nevertheless, there remains a need for improved hybrid pumps. The present invention is concerned with the provision of a hybrid pump in which 
the further stage, ie in addition to the turbomolecular stage, has been found to 
be particularly useful in conjunction with the turbomolecular stage itself. In accordance with the invention, there is provided a hybrid vacuum pump 
comprising: 
a turbomolecular stage positioned at the inlet end of the pump and 
comprising a stator formed from an array of stationary blades and a 
rotor formed from a further array of blades arranged for rotation at 
high speed between the stator blades, and  a molecular drag stage positioned at the outlet (high pressure) end of 
the pump and comprising at least two discs arranged for rotation 
within a stator with a minimal clearance between the circumferential 
edge of the discs and the stator, a flow passageway linking the 
turbomolecular stage with annular channels defined between the 
stator and opposing faces of the discs, and means for deflecting gas 
being pumped from the annular channels during rotation of the discs. Preferably the molecular drag stage comprises more than two discs, for example 
three, four or five, such that an annular channel is
