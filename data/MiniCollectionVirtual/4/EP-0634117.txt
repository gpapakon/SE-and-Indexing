<ABSTRACT>
A base for containers, intended to contain particularly but not 
exclusively cosmetics products, comprises an outer casing (12) in 

which there is fixed an insert (13) for receiving interchangeable 
cups or pans (11). Within said insert (13) there is provided at 

least one seat (14) for at least one cup (11), said seat (14) 
consisting of a base wall (15), two opposing side walls (16) and 

two opposing shoulders (17, 18) which extend between said walls 
(16) and along their entire length comprise undercuts (19, 20) in 

which there snap-engage teeth (22, 23) provided at the base of 
said cup (11). The shoulder (17) is rigid, whereas the shoulder 

(18) is elastically yieldable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a base for containers intended to
contain particularly but not exclusively cosmetics products, with
an incorporated fixed insert for retaining one or more
interchangeable cups in a freely removable manner.Said interchangeable cups - generally known as pans in this sector
- contain cosmetics products such as eye shadow, blusher, lip
gloss, rouge powder, face powder, etc.Said containers could however also be used for containing products
of different type, such as parapharmaceuticals or others.As is well known to the expert to the art the construction of
containers in general and/or of cases for containing cosmetics
products such as the aforesaid requires the solution of various
technical problems.One of these is the possibility of reutilizing the container once
its contained product has been used up, by merely replacing the
empty pans, which are available commercially in the form of
specific refills for that container.In this respect, to assure the consumer that the product contained
in the refill is original, it is desirable for the pans and the 
insert incorporated into the container base to comprise precise
corresponding locators so that components of different origin
cannot be fitted in.EP-A-0519482 and GB-A-571044 as well relate to a base for
containers according to the preamble of claim 1.Another technical problem relates to the facility for replacing
the pans contained in the container with other pans containing a
different cosmetics product or with a different number of modular
pans, with ease and without soiling the fingers.It is also desirable to provide a container with an interior in
which the assembled pans form a patten of pleasing appearance and
which can be varied.The general object of the present invention is to solve the
aforesaid problems in a simple, economical and functional manner.Said object is achieved by a container base having the
characteristics defined in the claim 1 and appended claims.The structural and functional characteristics of the invention and
its advantages compared with the known art will be more apparent
from the following description, given with reference to the
accompanying drawings which show one embodiment of a container
base for interchangeable pans formed in accordance with the
innovative principles of the invention. In the drawings:
Figure 1 is a top plan view of the container base according to the
invention;Figure 2 is a section on the plane II-II of Figure 1;Figure 3 is a section on the plane III-III of Figure 1; andFigure 4 is an
