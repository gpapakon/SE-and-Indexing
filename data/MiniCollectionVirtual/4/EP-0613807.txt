<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a displacement detector for a wire
rope against a guide member far detecting a displacement
degree when the rope guided by a guide member such as a
pulley is displaced from a standard point set in the guide
memberHeretofore, a transport apparatus having a rope guided
by a guide member includes, for example, a lift device, car
gondola device, ropeway, and cable car (hereinafter referred
to as the lift device) which consist of pulleys and wire
ropes, and what is generally known is a ski lift which is
disposed at skiing grounds. In such a ski lift, because of
its structure, carriers suspended from the wire rope have a
drawback of being easily influence by a side wind with
resect to the moving direction of the carriers. In
addition, since the ski lift is disposed among the mountains
where a gust of wind blows, there is a danger that the wire
rope easily comes off the pulley because of the sway of the 
carriers from side to side due to a side wind. As a safety
precaution, an off-position detector is disposed on each
lift device to detect the off-position of the wire rope from
a pulley on the one hand, and a monitor camera is used to
monitor the sideward sway of the carriers on the other hand.The above off-position detector detects the off-position
of the wire rope from a pulley when the wire rope
displaced from the pulley presses a switch such as a limit
switch which is disposed on the side of the pulley. And, to
monitor the sideward sway of carriers with the monitor
camera, monitor cameras are disposed at a plurality of
places along the stretched direction of the wire rope, and a
man keeps observing the sideward sway of carriers due to
wind on monitors from the cameras.In the lift device, the pulley is generally fixed and
the wire rope is designed to travel, but there is a lift
device where the wire rope is conversely fixed and the
pulley travels, and there is a danger in the same way as
above that the pulley is easily displaced from the wire rope
because of a sideward swat of the carrier due to a side
wind. Now, description will be made with reference to an
example where the wire rope travels.Incidentally, the aforementioned conventional off-position
detector is aimed at preventing a secondary hazard
which may be caused by operating the lift with the wire 
rope displaced from a pulley, and has a problem that it
cannot prevent the off-position of the wire rope from the
pulley. And, monitoring of the sideward sway of carriers
through the monitor cameras can hardly prevent the wire
