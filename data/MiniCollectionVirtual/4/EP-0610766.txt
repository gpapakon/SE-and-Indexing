The invention relates to a pump assembly (pumping set) with an adjustable-speed (variable-speed) electric motor (1), in particular for a dishwasher. The rotor shaft (27) of the electric motor (1) projects with a shaft stub (29) for driving the pump wheel (9) into the pump housing (12), which is flanged on the bearing bracket (13) of the electric motor (1). For the purpose of optimised operation of the pump (3) with respect to pump performance (output, capacity), noise etc., in accordance with the invention a device for detecting and/or controlling the speed of the electric motor (1) is arranged in the separating plane between the motor bearing bracket (13) and the pump housing (12).
