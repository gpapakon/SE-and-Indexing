<ABSTRACT>
A reproducing system has a pickup (2) for reading data on 
an optical disc (1), a memory (10), a memory controller (9) 

for storing data read out by pickup (2) in a memory (10), a 
reproducing device (11, 7, 8) for reproducing data stored 

in the memory (10). High speed scanning is instructed. In 
response to the instruction, the memory controller (9) 

operates to reproduce data stored stored in the memory (10) 
at skipped positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for
reproducing a magneto-optical recordable disc such as
Minidisc of SONY, and more particularly to a scanning
system.Today, the Minidisc (MD), which is capable of
random access as well as the CD, has become popular.
One type of the MDs is only for reproduction and is
manufactured in the same manner as the CD. Another
type of MD is a recordable MD made of magneto-optical
disc, capable of over-writing by a magneto-optical
modulation recording method. Namely, in order to write
data on the disc, a laser beam is radiated from under
the disc to elevate the temperature thereof, and a
magnetic field is applied from above to reverse the
magnetic field of the recording surface. Hence the
recordable MD cartridge has a shutter having an access
window on either side thereof.The main feature of the MD is its full function of
random accessibility. For example, when polycarbonate is
injection molded to form a substrate of the MD, a
pregroove is also formed along the entire track of the
disc so that a track-following servo system and spindle 
servo system are utilized at recording and at
reproduction.Addresses are recorded along the entire track of
the MD so that a stable and quick random access is
possible even in the case of unrecorded disc. Hence,
editing of the disc is much simplified.Referring to Fig. 8, a disc player for reproducing
a CD 1a has a pickup 2 for reading out data recorded
thereon. The read put data are amplified by an R/F
amplifier 3 and fed to a digital signal processor 5
through a servo processor 4. The data are further fed
to a D/A converter 7 so as to be converted into an
analog signal. The analog signal is amplified by an
amplifier 8 and outputted through a loudspeaker. The
R/F amplifier 5, servo processor 4, and digital signal
processor 5 are controlled by a CPU 6.In such a player, a scanning for quickly
reproducing the recorded data is performed by
depressing a fast forward button or a reverse button
while playing a CD. Namely, as shown in Fig. 9, when
the scanning is instructed while playing at a step 201,
the player reproduces the data for a very short time
such as several tens of milliseconds at a step 202. At
a step 203, the pickup 2 of the player jumps to the
adjacent track, and then again reproduces the data for
several tens of milliseconds. The steps 202 and 203 
are repeated so that the data are intermittently
reproduced as shown in Fig. 10.Referring to Fig. 11, a conventional player for an
MD 1 has a memory controller 9, a dynamic random
acces

<CLAIMS>
A reproducing system for an optical disc (1) having data
recorded thereon, the system having a pickup (2) for

reading the data on the disc (1), a memory (10), a memory
controller (9) for storing data read out by the pickup

(2) in the memory (10), a reproducing device (11, 7, 8)
for reproducing data stored in the memory (10),

and means (6A) for instructing a scanning at a high speed
which is higher than the normal speed of data

reproduction, wherein successive not directly continuous
short intervals of data on the disk (1) are reproduced,

characterized in that

the memory controller (9) is arranged to respond to an
instruction of the means (6A) for instructing high speed

scanning by controlling the reading of data already
stored in the memory for normal speed reproduction,

wherein only short intervals of the already stored data
are read, so that successive not directly continuous

short intervals of data are reproduced.
The system according to Claim 1,

characterized by

further comprising writing means which are arranged to
respond to the instructions of the means (6A) for

instructing high speed scanning by writing short
intervals of data read out by the pick up (2) into the

memory (10), so that the data, which were written after
the instruction, can be read out from the memory (10) in

a continuous manner in order to reproduce the short
intervals of data. 
The system according to Claim 2,

characterized in that

the memory controller (9) is arranged to determine when
all short intervals of data to be reproduced from the

data, which data are already stored in the memory (10)
for normal speed reproduction, are read out from the

memory (10) during high speed scanning and the memory
controller (9) is arranged to control afterwards the

reading of the data which were written after the
instruction.
The system according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

wherein the instruction given by the means (6A) for
instructing high speed scanning is a instruction to scan

the data on the disk (1) in a reverse direction compared
to the normal reproduction direction,

characterized in that

the memory controller (9) is arranged to control the
reading of short intervals of data, which are already

read from the memory (10) for normal speed reproduction
and which are still stored in the memory (10), in a

reverse order to reproduce the short intervals in the
reverse order.
The system according to one of Claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that

the memory (10) is a ring buffer memory, wherein the data
stored for normal speed reproduction are stored in a

continuous manner in consecutive memory regions and
wherein the successive not directly continuous short

intervals of data are read out from the memory (10) by
skipping data intervals which are not to be reproduced

for scanning.
