<ABSTRACT>
A tissue transplant comprises viable, physiologically active, tissue cells and has a non-fibrogenic coating of a divalent metal alginate. The coating has a sufficiently low permeability and a sufficiently large thickness to protect the tissue cells from host immunological agents after transplantation, and is sufficiently permeable and thin to permit the diffusion of sufficient cell nutrients and cell products through the coating required for cell viability. The tissue cells may be pancreatic islet cells, neural cells, renal cortex cells, vascular endothelial cells, thyroid cells, adrenal cells, thymic cells, ovarian cells, hepatic cells, and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to the field of medical
transplants of cells and tissues, the manufacture of such
transplants, and their use. In particular, this invention
is directed to the coating of transplants with a novel,
highly protective coating of alginate free of transplantation-impairing
amounts of impurities, the coated tissues
formed by this coating process and the transplants made
using these products.Traditional medical treatments for functional
deficiencies of secretory and other biological organs have
focused on replacing identified normal products of the
deficient organ with natural or synthetic pharmaceutical
compositions. For example, for treating insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus, also known as type I or juvenile onset
diabetes, the normal secretion of insulin by the islets of
Langerhans in the pancreas must be replaced since
functional islets are no longer present in the pancreas.
This pancreatic function is emulated by administering
insulin, titrating the injections in response to blood
glucose level measurements. At best, insulin production
and secretion of the islets is imperfectly approximated and
normally is poorly approximated.Organ replacement has also been used. This has
generally required continuous use of immunosuppressive
agents to prevent immunological rejection of the organ,
depriving the patient of the full protective function of
the immune system against disease. This approach has
provided permanent relief only for a limited group of
organs. Attempts to transplant organ tissues into
genetically dissimilar hosts without immunosuppression have 
been generally defeated by the immune system of the host.
Prior to this invention, the application of effective
protective barrier coatings to isolate the transplant
tissues from the host immune system did not prove to be
medically practical for a number of reasons. The coating
materials were incompatible with the host system or
otherwise unsuitable. The previously developed encapsulation
or coating processes did not yield reproducible
coatings having the desired porosity and thickness required
for the transplanted tissue to have a long and effective
functioning life in the host.To protect transplants from destruction by the immune
response of the host animal, various attempts have been
made to create a protective barrier between the transplant
tissue or cells and the immunological components of the
host's system. T.M.S. Chang (Chang, T.M.S., Science 146:
524-525 (1964) described the microencapsulation of
