<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides flexible compositions 
which have 20-90% by total weight of composition of a 

filler selected from the group consisting of barium 
sulfate, zinc oxide, zirconium oxide, zirconium silicate 

and mixtures thereof, and a thermoplastic resin, which 
when filled with 20-90% by total weight of composition 

of the filler, has a flexural strength of less than 7500 
psi.

<DESCRIPTION>
Generally in the prior art it has been known 
to use mineral fillers to modify the properties of 
flexible thermoplastic resins. These thermoplastics 
resins were filled at low levels because it would be 
expected that high levels of fillers would adversely 
affect the physical properties of the resins. It has 
been found that with fillers selected from the group 
consisting zinc oxide, barium sulfate, zirconium oxide, 
zirconium silicate or mixtures thereof, it is possible 
to incorporate, up to 90% by total weight of composition, 
of filler. These filled flexible thermoplastics are 
opaque to x-rays and may be molded or thermoformed into 
x-ray barriers for use in protecting radiation sensitive 
materials such as photographic film. These materials 
may also be formed into structural elements, that may be 
used to protect medical and industrial personnel from 
exposure to direct x-radiation or reflected x-rays. The flexible thermoplastic resins within the 
scope of the invention include those which when filled 
with from 20-90% by total weight of composition of 
barium sulfate, zinc oxide, zirconium oxide, zirconium 
silicate or mixtures thereof, are substantially free of 
internal voids and will have a flexural strength of less 
than 7500 psi when tested according to ASTM D-790. Accordingly, it is a primary object of the 
invention to provide novel thermoplastic molding 
compositions which include high levels of fillers and 
are flexible. It is also an object of this invention to 
provide novel thermoplastic molding compositions which 
has good surface properties and may be molded into 
complex shapes.  It is also an object of this invention to 
provide novel thermoplastic molding compositions which 
have a density greater than 1.0. These and other objects of the invention will 
become apparent from a review of the present 
specification. The invention provides novel thermoplastic 
molding compositions which comprise (a) from 20-90% by 
total weight of a filler selected from the group 
consisting of barium sulfate, zinc oxide, zirconium 
oxide, zirconium silicate and mixtures thereof; and (b) 
a thermoplastic resin which when filled with from 20-90% 
by weight of barium sulfate, zinc oxide, zirconium oxide, 
zirconium silicate and mixtures thereof, has a flexural 
strength of less than 7500 psi. The resins useful in the practice of the 
invention include olefin resins, such as low density 
polyethylene (d = about 0.920); high density polyethylene 
(d = above 0.94); linear low density polyethylene (d =
