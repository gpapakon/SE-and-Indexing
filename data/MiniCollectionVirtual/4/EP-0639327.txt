<ABSTRACT>
A construction for automatically milking animals 
such as cows, comprises one or a number of rest boxes of 

which at least one (2) is laid out as a milk box equipped 
with a milking robot (19). Furthermore there is provided a 

computer system (25) for controlling the milking robot and 
for automatically milking the animals. With the aid of 

computer-controlled means, an animal is admitted to the milk 
box (2) when one or several criteria, such as a certain 

extent to which the animal's lactation period has advanced, 
are met.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction
according to the preamble of claim 1.From EP-A-0 091 892,
which serves as a basis for the preamble of claim 1,
there is known a construction
which comprises an animal stall provided with cubicles or
cubical sheds and feeding places, in which stall the animals
are allowed to walk about freely and from which stall they
are allowed to go to the milk box. It is possible for the
animals to present themselves at any time at the milk box,
while there are provided time criteria for deciding whether
an animal presenting itself at the milk box is actually
allowed to be milked. With said time criterion the lapse of
time from the preceding milking to the point of time when the
animal presents itself again for milking is determined. As
the criterion of time does not take other factors sufficiently
into account, this criterion does not always lead to
an optimum milk production. In order to augment the milk
production, the construction as described in the opening
paragraph has according to the invention the additional features
set out in the characterising portion of claim 1.As a criterion for admitting an animal to
the milk box can further be taken the magnitude of the force
necessary to depress the udder for a certain distance, for
instance, of one or two centimetres. This force will be
larger for a full udder than that for the udder of a recently
milked animal. Finally, it should be stated that the decision
whether to pass on an animal to the milk box or not can be
arranged such that it is made independently of the instantaneous
capacity of the milk box. When the connection of teat 
cups and the milking of all animals to be milked in the milk
box by means of the milking robot proceeds without any
difficulty, the milking robot will have a certain capacity
left and animals can be milked earlier, whereas, when troubles
occur, animals which otherwise comply with the given
criteria for their being milked will still be sent back to
the animal stall in order to be able to give priority to
other animals whose last milking took place less recently.
Each of the criteria mentioned, especially the last criterion,
can be applied in conjunction with any other one of them.Hereinafter, the invention and, particularly, the
various criteria on the basis of which it is decided whether
an animal is admitted to the milk box or not, will be further
explained with reference to the following embodiment of the
invention and the accompanying drawings, in which:

<CLAIMS>
A construction for automatically milking animals
such as cows, provided with one or a number of rest boxes of

which at least one is laid out as a milk box (2) equipped
with a milking robot (19), while furthermore there is provided

a computer system (25) for controlling the milking
robot (19) and for automatically milking the animals, characterized

in that there is provided one or a number of sensors
(27, 28) to determine the size or change in size of the

udder, where
means are provided for registering

the sensor data in the memory of
the computer system (25) and

wherein said sensor data
are determinative to the decision

whether an animal is to be admitted to be milked automatically
by the computer-controlled milking robot or not.
A construction according to claim 1, characterized
in that a sensor is made up of picture recording means (26)

connected to the computer system, where the size or change in
size of the udder is determined by means of picture analysis,

and more particularly, contour analysis.
A construction according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that there are provided at least two sensors (27,

28), such as ultrasound or laser sensors, disposed approximately
on either side of the udder of an animal present

in a rest box, for determining the distance to the animal's
udder, from which data combined with the dimensional data of

the rest box (1) the size or change in size of the udder is
fixed.
A construction according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that there are provided two

rest boxes (1, 2) which connect with each other and have to
be passed through successively for milking.
A construction according to claim 4, characterized
in that the rear rest box (1) is arranged as a selection box

and the front rest box (2) is arranged as a milk box.
A construction according to claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that an automatic feeder is provided in the rear

box only.
A construction according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that there are provided means

for depressing the udder for a certain distance and means for
measuring the force required to do so, enabling the animal to

be sent on to the milk box (1, 2) if this force exceeds a
certain predetermined value.
A construction according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that in a cubicle is provided

for the animal wherein
there are provided signalling means which become

operative when in the most recent 24-hours' period an animal
has given a higher milk yield than in the preceding period.
A construction according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said sensor means are sensor

means through which it is possible to determine the distance
from either side wall of the box to either side of the udder

of an animal to be milked.
