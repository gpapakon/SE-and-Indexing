<ABSTRACT>
Now there are photo CD players on the market. Such players and 
photo CD's do have high prices. In addition, the user cannot 

store in his home photos on such photo CD's. Currently, there 
are 4-head VCR's on the market with excellent 'still picture' 

feature and frame by frame advance, the letter only in play 
mode.

 
According to the invention an automatic picture index management 

can be added to such VCR's. Usually, the VCR is connected to a 
TV set. If the VCR is switched to the photo mode, the VCR 

displays on the TV set user instructions for handling the 
storage and search of such photos on the VCR. The camera and/or 

an according input/output circuit within the VCR are adapted for 
receiving and output of such still pictures.

<DESCRIPTION>
Now there are photo CD players on the market (CD: compact disc). 
Such players and photo CD's do have high prices. In addition, 
the user can not store in his home photos on such photo CD's. 
Only a specific standard is allowed. It is an object of the invention to disclose a method for still 
picture recording which is cheap, uses cheap storage media and 
which can operate in the user's home. This object is reached by 
the method disclosed in claim 1. It is a further object of the invention to disclose an apparatus 
which utilises the inventive method. This object is reached by 
the apparatus disclosed in claim 4. Currently, there are 4-head VCR's on the market with excellent 
'still picture' feature and frame by frame advance, the letter 
only in play mode. For example, the VH 5270 type VCR of THOMSON 
is such a device.
 
According to the invention an automatic picture index management 
can be added to such VCR's. Usually, the VCR is connected to a 
TV set. If the VCR is switched to the photo mode, the VCR displays 
on the TV set user instructions for handling the storage 
and search of such photos on the VCR. The camera and/or an 
according input/output circuit within the VCR are adapted for 
receiving and output of such still pictures. Instead of a camera 
an optical sensor unit may be used in which the photo is inserted.  Of cause, the picture quality of such (analogue) recorded photos 
can not be as high as with a photo CD player, but there are applications 
in which the much cheaper and quicker solution should 
be preferred. This is especially true, where a user wants to record 
photos in his home without spending time and efforts for 
visiting a dealer. In principle the inventive method consists in still picture recording, 
wherein a tape recorder is used to store or replay 
still pictures received from an optical sensor unit - especially 
a camera - and wherein said still pictures are stored on or read 
from the tape using automatic indexing and possibly other picture 
related information and said still pictures are displayed 
on a display device - especially a TV set - on which also 
(intermediately) user guide information for storing or searching 
said still pictures and/or the index information and/or said 
other picture related information is displayed. Advantageous additional embodiments of the inventive method are 
resulting from the respective dependent claims. In principle the inventive tape recorder for still picture 
recording comprises an automatic indexing unit generating index
