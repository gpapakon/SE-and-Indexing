<ABSTRACT>
An oscillator having two synchronised oscillator rings (L1, L2) is described. Synchronisation is accomplished by circuitry (SC1, SC2, SC3) connected between the outputs of two aligned stages in coupled oscillator rings, the circuitry being operable to maintain outputs of the stages 180 DEG  apart in phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title of the Invention RING OSCILLATORField of the InventionThis invention relates to a ring oscillator.Background to the InventionNew manufacturing processes and new applications are forcing power supplies to lower voltages (3.3v now, with 2.4v and 1.5v being expected soon) . Advanced Phase-Locked Loops require stable oscillators which may be varied in frequency by a control signal.To help achieve frequency stability, oscillators integrated into a noisy VLSI environment often use a regulator to generate a quiet power supply. This usually has to be at an even lower voltage than the normal power supply.There is thus a desire to provide oscillators which can work at these very low supply voltages and still produce high quality, high frequency output signals. ,Summary of the InventionAccording to the present invention there is provided an oscillator comprising two oscillator rings, each oscillator ring comprising the same number of oscillator stages, each stage having a single input and a single output and being operable to provide at said output an output signal which is phase-shifted by a controllable amount relative to an input signal provided at said input, each stage having a current source arranged to receive a control signal to adjust said phase-shift, the input of each stage being connected to receive the output of a preceding stage, wherein the oscillator further comprises synchronisation circuitry connected between the outputs of two aligned stages in the 

coupled oscillator rings and operable to maintain said outputs 180° apart in phase.Where there is an even number of stages in each ring the rings are coupled by connection of the output of a last stage in each ring to the input of a first stage in the other ring.Preferably there is synchronisation circuitry between each set of two aligned stages.The synchronisation circuitry can comprise first and second cross-coupled transistors acting in a feedback arrangement between said outputs.Each stage can comprise first and second transistors, wherein the first transistor has a controllable path connected between an output node and a reference voltage and a control node acting as an input node to the stage and wherein the second transistor has a controllable path connected between the output node and the reference voltage and a control node connected to the output node, the current source being connected to said output node.For transistors of the same length, the width of the first transistor can be set to m times the width of the second transistor
