<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a flame retardative 
polycarbonate resin composition which comprises 100 parts 

by weight of an aromatic polycarbonate resin (A), 0.01 to 
0.5 part by weight of an alkali/or alkaline-earth metal 

salt of a perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid (B), 0.03 to 5 
parts by weight of an organopolysiloxane containing 

organoxysilyl group bonded to a silicon atom through a 
divalent hydrocarbon group (C), and optionally 5 to 120 

parts by weight of an inorganic filler. The above 
composition has excellent flame retardancy capable of 

preventing dripping thereof at the time of combustion of a 
thin-walled material made from the highly fluidized 

composition while maintaining the dimensional stability 
and the mechanical properties such as impact resistance 

that are inherent in polycarbonate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel flame
retardative polycarbonate resin composition. More
particularly, it pertains to a polycarbonate resin
composition excellent in flame retardancy and capable of
preventing dripping thereof at the time of combustion of
a thin-walled material made from the composition highly
fluidized while precluding the deterioration of the
mechanical properties such as impact resistance as well as
dimensional stability that are inherent in polycarbonate.A polycarbonate resin is excellent in mechanical
strength, particularly impact strength, electrical
properties, transparency and the like and is widely
utilized in a variety of fields of office automation
machinery, electric and electronic machinery, automobiles,
architecture and the like. Some of the above-mentioned
utilization fields typified by the fields of office
automation machinery and electric and electronic machinery
are required to have high flame retardancy.Of various thermoplastic resins, polycarbonate has
a high oxygen index and in general, a self-fire-extinguishing
property. However, in order to meet the 
requirement on the safety in various application fields
of office automation machinery, electric and electronic
machinery and the like, there is strongly required the
development of a resin composition which is further
enhanced not only in flame retardancy but also in fluidity
in view of the demand directed to thin-walled material.A polycarbonate resin has heretofore been imparted
with flame retardancy usually by being incorporated with a
flame retardant and a flame retardant aid. The most
prevailing flame retardant used for a polycarbonate is a
bromine-based flame retardant.However, the polycarbonate resin composition
incorporated with such a bromine-based flame retardant
involues the environmental problem that a gas generated
at the time of combustion, for example, a gas generated
at the time of combustion of the composition incorporated
with decabromodiphenyl ether or the like causes a fear of
containing dioxin which has been one of the most serious
problems in recent years due to its influence on human
bodies.Such being the case, investigation on a nonbromine-based
flame retardant is in progress for the sake of
flame retardation of a polycarbonate resin. For example,
Japanese Patent Publication NÂ°. 40445/1972 discloses a
polycarbonate resin composition which is incorporated with
an alkali metal salt or an alkaline earth metal salt of a
perfluoroalkanesulfonic acid, but the technique disclosed 
therein
