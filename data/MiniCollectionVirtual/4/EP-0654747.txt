<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape printing
device for printing desired bar codes on a tape.Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. HEI-5-177898
has proposed a tape printer including a keyboard,
a display, and a print mechanism. The print
mechanism is capable of printing characters, such as
letters, symbols, and the like, on different width tapes
(for example, 12 mm and 18 mm wide tapes) that are
housed in cassettes. In particular, the tape mechanism
is capable of printing bar codes on the tape with and in
addition to the characters. The tape printer described in
Japanese Patent Application Kokai No. HEI-5-177898 is
well-suited printing file names on tapes that can be
adhered to the back of files as identification labels.Recently, another Japanese Patent Application
Kokai No. HEI-5-185695 (JP-A-5 185 695) has proposed
a tape printer for printing numbered character
strings, made from inputted strings of numbers, on a
tape while numbering processes are performed to increment
numbering of successive character strings. This
publication has proposed a structure also capable of
performing numbering processes by incrementing or
counting up at a line order of alphabetic characters.With the popularization of office automation
equipment, there is a general demand to computerize
records of magnetic media, such as magnetic tapes and
floppy disks, or of vast numbers of books in libraries.
Keeping track of magnetic media or books can be easily
performed by producing bar codes with category codes,
that are for categorizing fields of magnetic media or
books, and number codes associated with these categories,
adhering the bar codes to the magnetic media or
books, and reading the bar codes with a bar code
reader.The printer described in Japanese Patent
Application Kokai No. HEI-5-177898 allows printing bar
codes based on effective characters that are made from
inputted numbers, characters, and the like. The printer
described in Japanese Patent Application Kokai No.
HEI-5-185695 allows performing numbering processes
on numbered character strings (made from strings of
numbers), but not on bar codes.From EP 0 550 269 A2 a bar code printer
capable of printing bar codes simultaneously with character
strings is known. the bar code printer comprises
input means for inputting data indicative of a bar code
desired to be printed on a tape, storage means for temporarily
storing the inputted data print data generation
means for producing print data for the desired bar code
and printing means for receiving the print data and for
