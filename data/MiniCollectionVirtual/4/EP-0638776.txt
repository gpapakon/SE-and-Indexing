<ABSTRACT>
A method for reducing the emission of odour and pollutants arising during the operation of a heating apparatus for vehicles is described, by which method the exhaust gases produced in the combustion chamber (1) of the heating apparatus during the combustion of the liquid fuel are guided over catalytically active layers arranged within the heating apparatus. Also disclosed is an arrangement having the two possibilities, which can be employed individually but also in combination, whereby   a) the layers forming the flow path for the exhaust gas within the heating apparatus, namely the outer surface of the flame tube (7) and the inner surface of the heat exchanger (12), are coated to be catalytically active and/or b) a catalytically active knitted fabric (21.3) is arranged in the space formed between flame tube and heat exchanger.

Arrangement for reducing the emission of odours
and pollutants, with a catalytically active section for

exhaust gases to flow through, when operating a heater
appliance for vehicles which is independent of the

engine and runs with liquid fuel, having a combustion
chamber (1) and a downstream flame tube (7), as well as

a heat exchanger (12) which is arranged concentrically
with respect to the combustion chamber and with respect

to the flame tube, in which the exhaust gas is diverted
after it has emerged from the flame tube (7) and is

guided through the heat exchanger (12) to the exhaust-gas
outlet piece (16), characterized in that a

catalytically coated, metallic knitted fabric (21.3) is
arranged in a section of the exhaust-gas flow path

between the combustion-chamber/flame-tube outer wall
and the heat-exchanger inner wall.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the knitted fabric (21.3) is metallically set

and is matched to the contour (21.2) of the heat
exchanger (12).
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized
in that an elastic intermediate layer is arranged

between the metallic setting of the knitted fabric
(21.3) and the heat exchanger (12).
Arrangement according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the intermediate layer consists of swellable-matt

material. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that a ceramic monolith is provided in

the catalytically active section of the exhaust-gas
flow path.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that an SiC body with a suitable

coating is provided in the catalytically active section
of the exhaust-gas flow path.
