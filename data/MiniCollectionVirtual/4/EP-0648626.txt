<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a coupling device for a flap arrangement which has two flap elements (2, 3), the swivelling axes (2', 3') of which are arranged essentially orthogonally with respect to each other, it being possible to convert, by means of the coupling device (4), a swivelling movement of the first flap element (2) into a swivelling movement of the second flap element (3) of the flap arrangement (1) by a control pin (6) of a first actuating element (5) of the coupling device (4), which actuating element (5) is connected to the first flap element (2), engaging in a radial cam (8) of a second actuating element (7) of the coupling device (4), which actuating element (7) is connected to the second flap element (3). Provision is made, according to the invention, for the control pin (6) of the first actuating element (5) of the coupling device (4) to have, at least over its longitudinal region which is in engagement, during the swivelling movement, with the radial cam (8) of the second actuating element (4), an essentially elliptical, and over the longitudinal region constant, cross-section.

A coupling device for a flap arrangement which has two flap elements 
(2, 3) whose axes of rotation (2', 3') are positioned essentially 

orthogonally to one other, whereby a rotating movement of the first 
flap element (2) can be converted into a rotating movement of the 

second flap element (3) of the flap arrangement (1) by the coupling 
device (4) by means of the engagement of a controlling pin (6) on a 

first actuating element (5) of the coupling device (4) connected to the 
first flap element (2) in a control curve (8) on a second actuating 

element (7) of the coupling device (4) connected to the second flap 
element (3), 
characterised in that
 at least the longitudinal section of 
the control pin (6) on the first actuating element (5) of the coupling 

device (4) which engages with the control curve (8) on the second 
actuating element (7) during the rotating movement has an essentially 

elliptical cross section which is constant over this longitudinal section. 
A coupling device for the flap arrangement in accordance with Claim 
1, 
characterised in that
 the principal axis of the elliptical cross 
section of the control pin (6) is equal to half of the minimum distance 

between two opposite guide surfaces (8a, 8b) on the control curve (8) 
on the second actuating element (7) of the coupling device (4). 
A coupling device in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that
 in the middle of the rotating movement of the second flap 
element (3), the principal axis of the elliptical cross section of the 

control pin (6) on the first actuating element (5) of the coupling  
 

device (4) is positioned orthogonally to the guide tracks (8a, 8b) of 
the control curve (8) on the second actuating element (7). 
A coupling device in accordance with Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 
in the middle of the rotating movement of the second flap element (3), 

essentially only the principal apexes (HS1, HS2) of the elliptical cross 
section of the control pin (6) engage with the guide tracks (8a, 8b) on 

the control curve (8) on the second actuating element (7) of the 
coupling device (4). 
A coupling device in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that
 the secondary axes of the elliptical cross section of the control 
pin (6) a
re determined in such a way that in the initial and final 
positions of the flap elements (2, 3) of the flap arrangement (1), the 

control pin (6) on the first actuating element (5) engages with the 
guide tracks (8a, 8b) on the control curve (8) on the second actuating 

element (7) of the coupling device (4). 
A coupling device in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
the control pin (6) forms an integral part of the first actuating element
