<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a filling device for cylindrical containers (8). In order to achieve a high-density filling of the container (8), for example with granular filling material, it is proposed to meter the filling material and to set the container (8) to be filled in shaking rotation by means of a receptacle executing rotary oscillation.

<CLAIMS>
Device for filling a cylindrical container (8) with 
shaped filling material (3), e.g. granule or tablet 

shaped, the container (8) being located in a receiving 
portion (7) and the filling material (10), introduced 

by a conveyor, falling in measured doses into the 
filling aperture of the container (8), characterised in 

that the receiving portion (7) vibrates in a rotary 
manner and consequently sets the container (8) into a 

shaking rotary movement about its axis (12), and in 
that the filling material (3) falls into the container 

(8) to one side of the axis (12). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the rotary vibration of the receiving portion (7) is 

produced by a separate drive independent of the 
conveyor. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the conveyor is a vibrating conveyor and in that the 

rotary vibration of the receiving portion (7) is 
produced by the drive of the vibrating convyeor. 
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the receiving portion (7) is secured on its outer edge 

(11) directly on the vibrating conveyor. 
Device according to claim 2, 3 or 4, characterised 
in that the vibration output of the drive is 

adjustable. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the receiving portion (7) 

is exchangeable.  
 
Device according to one of the preceding claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the receiving portion (7) 

is cup-shaped. 
Device according to claim 7, characterised in that 
the receiving portion (7) is equipped with a viewing 

window (9).
