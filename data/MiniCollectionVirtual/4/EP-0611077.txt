<ABSTRACT>
Thermoplastic polyurethane blends contain thermoplastic polyurethane and 
copolymer comprsing at least 5 weight percent of N-vinyl lactam units. Blends of 

the invention generally are compatible or miscible, and many exhibit clarity and 
other desirable physical properties, such as attractive tensile modulus, distortion 

resistance and impact resistance, which are improved over the properties of the 
thermoplastic polyurethane component of the blend or of thermoplastic 

polyurethanes blends in the art.

<DESCRIPTION>
Thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (TPPUE) may be described as 
multiblock copolymers of general structure represented by (A-B)n, where A and B 
are hard and soft segments, respectively, and n is >1, typically >10 and often >100. 
TPPUEs are prepared from mixtures of diisocyanates, diols, and, often, low 
molecular weight polyol or polyamine chain extenders, which after reaction yield 
the multiblock copolymers. TPPUEs also may be prepared from diisocyanates, 
polyester or polyether diols or diamines, and low molecular weight polyols, 
polyamines, or mixtures of polyols and polyamines. The soft segment (B) typically 
results from a polyether or polyester diol component while the hard segment (A) 
typically results from the diisocyanate component. A book, Polyurethane 
Elastomers, by C. Hepburn (Applied Science, London, 1982), particularly 
Chapter 9 
therein, broadly describes TPPUEs of the type related to the invention. The known TPPUEs and blends containing TPPUEs all suffer some 
drawbacks in one or more properties, including mechanical properties, color 
stability to heat and light, clarity, and useful heat distortion properties. For example, 
in TPPUEs, the hard segments tend to agglomerate to form glassy and semi-crystalline 
phases in an elastomeric matrix of the soft segments, often leading to 
microphase separation (often termed "nacreous effect") due to incompatibility 
between, for example, polyether or polyester soft (B) segments and the hard 
urethane or urea (A) blocks. Phase separation becomes visually obvious when the 
elastomers are dyed or pigmented. The occurrence of phase separation is disclosed, 
for example, in US Patent No. 4,179,479, wherein polymeric blends are prepared 
from acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene ("ABS")- graft copolymers, high molecular 
weight (500,000 to 1,500,000) acrylate polymers and thermoplastic polyurethanes. 
All of the '479 patent compositions showed evidence of the nacreous effect and poor 
low and room temperature mechanical properties. Phase-separated materials also 
generally show poor tear resistance; hence, molded articles with reduced wall 
thickness, such as ski boot fastenings, do not possess sufficient toughness to 
withstand severe stress conditions. Another problem is achieving toughness above 
about 40 M Pascal in TPPUEs or known TPPUE blends, and attempts to improve one 
property, such as toughness, often lead to degeneration of another property. For 
example, an attempt to improve the mechanical properties of TPPUEs (German
