<ABSTRACT>
In a cutter head, especially for a profile cutter, with a basic body (1) having at least two recesses (3) uniformly distributed around its circumference, cutter (5) can interchangeably be secured in the recesses by means of a clamping device having at least on clamping component (8) and at least one clamping screw acting therewith and with the basic body (1). In the region of its inner end section, each of the clamping components is supported by the basic body (1) to pivot about an axis parallel to the latter's axis of rotation (12) and pivotable and clampable by means of at least one of the clamping screws (10) by a tensile force generated thereby against a bearing surface (4) of the recess (3).

Cutter head, in particular a profile 
cutter head, 


a) comprising a basic body (1), which is 
provided with at least two recesses (3) 

uniformly distributed around the 
circumference thereof; 
b) in which cutters (5) can be secured in an 
exchangeable manner by means of a 

clamping device in each case, which 
clamping device comprises at least one 

clamping element (8) in each case and at 
least one clamping screw (10) cooperating 

therewith and with the basic body (1); 
c) in the region of the inner end section 
thereof, each of the clamping components 

is supported by the basic body (1) in 
such a manner that it can pivot about an 

axis parallel to the axis of rotation of 
the basic body (1) and can be pivoted and 

clamped by at least one of the clamping 
screws (10) in each case, by a tensile 

force generated thereby against a bearing 
surface (4) of the recess (3);  

 
d) each of the clamping elements (8) 
comprises a pressure zone which is turned 

towards the cutter (5) and which 
transfers the tensile force and which 

presses the cutter (5) against the 
abutment surface (4) of the recess (3); 
 
characterised in that 


e) the pressure zone of each clamping 
element (8) is formed as a flat pressure 

surface (9), which contacts the cutter 
(5) over its entire surface from near to 

the radially external blade thereof to 
near to the inner edge thereof; and 
f) each clamping element (8) is profiled in 
a manner corresponding to the associated 

cutter (5). 
Cutter head according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the pivot axis of the 

clamping element (8) is displaced in relation to 
the pressure surface (9) against the abutment 

surface (4). 
Cutter head according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that each clamping element (8) 

comprises, as mounting means, a semi-cylindrical  
 

material part (8') which projects beyond the 
pressing surface (9) and extends in the axial 

direction of the basic body (1) and engages in a 
groove (7) of the recess (3), which groove is 

semi-circular in cross-section. 
Cutter head according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that each of the 

clamping screws (10) engages on the clamping 
element (8) in the area between the mounting point 

of the clamping element (8) and the pressing 
surface (9) thereof which acts for the abutment of 

the cutter (5). 
Cutter head according to one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the basic body (1) is 

provided with a bore (6) for each clamping screw 
(10), which bore comprises a shoulder (6') which 

points away from the clamping element (8) and acts 
for the abutment of a head of the clamping screw 

(10) and is aligned with a threaded bore (17) of 
the clamping element (8) for the engagement of the 

clamping screw (10). 
Cutter head according to one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterised by a connection which is form-locking  

 
in the radial direction, between each 

clamping element (8) and the associated cutter 
(5); by a groove (11) which extends over the 

entire axial extension of the cutter (5) in the 
axial direction; and a material part (12) which 

engages therein and extends over the entire axial 
extension of the clamping element (10). 
Cutter head according to one of Claims 1 
to 6, characterised by the positioning of each of 

the cutters (5) in the axial direction by means of 
a pin which extends transverse to the axial 

direction of the basic body (1), which projects 
out of the abutment surface (4) of the basic body 

(1) for the cutter into the recess (3) and which 
engages in a corresponding recess (14) of the 

cutter (5). 
Cutter head according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the basic 

body (1) is profiled corresponding to the cutters 
(5) and the cutters (5) only project slightly over 

the basic body (1). 
Cutter head according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the basic  

 
body consists of light metal.
