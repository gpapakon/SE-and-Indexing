<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous dispersion 
comprising a silylated epoxy resin and a methods of using it. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to an aqueous dispersion 
comprising a silylated epoxy resin and its use in coatings for metal 
and glass and in adhesives. Epoxy resins in use today are limited by the ability to 
form a dispersion in water. It is highly desirable to have epoxy resins 
available in a form that is water stable and can be easily dispersed in 
water. Further, it is desirable to disperse the epoxy resins without 
the requirement of ionic or salt components such as carboxylic acids 
or amine salts that damage or corrode inorganic surfaces such as 
metal and glass. Also, it is desirable to avoid the use of dispersing 
aids such as nonionic, anionic, and cationic surfactants, since these 
surfactants interfere with the film forming properties of the epoxy 
resin. Furthermore, the avoidance of organic solvents is desirable 
because it reduces volatile organic compound emissions to the 
workplace and the environment and provide greater safety in the 
workplace because of reduced flammability and toxicity during 
production. Hence, there is an on-going need to provide epoxy resins 
that are easily dispersed in water. Common uses for these dispersions of epoxy resins are 
as ingredients in coatings for inorganic surfaces, such as siliceous 
materials, metals or metal oxides and in adhesives. Coatings 
produced from dispersions of epoxy resins are used to protect the 
surface from abrasion and corrosion. A typical use for these dispersions of epoxy resins is as 
ingredients in glass fiber coatings, often referred to as "sizes". Glass 
fibers are produced by melting glass in a furnace and allowing it to 
flow through small holes in a platinum/rhodium plate usually  
 
referred to as a bushing. After the molten glass passes through the 
holes it is cooled and drawn onto a collecting device at a very high 
rate of speed. During this process, there is considerable glass-to-glass 
abrasion or friction which can cause significant weakening of 
the glass fibers. To protect the glass fibers from abrasion, a sizing 
composition is applied to the glass fibers using an applicator as the 
fibers are drawn and before they are wound on the collector. These 
dispersions of epoxy resins also impart other desirable properties to 
the glass fibers, such as binding or gluing the individual fiber 
filaments into a fiber strand, improving fiber handling or processing 
to make a fiber
