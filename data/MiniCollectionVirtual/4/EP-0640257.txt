<ABSTRACT>
A combined programmable gain and integrating amplifier comprises an operational amplifier (12) having a non-inverting input terminal coupled to a reference voltage. A plurality of capacitors (C1... C63) are selectively connectable in parallel between the inverting input terminal and the amplifier output terminal. At least one terminal of each capacitor is connected to the inverting input terminal. A plurality of controllable switches (X1... X63) are connected in series circuit between a corresponding one of the capacitors and the amplifier output terminal for coupling the capacitors in circuit between the inverting input terminal and the output terminal. In a first operational state, each of the switches connects the capacitors between the input and output terminals. In a second operational state, the switches connect selected ones of the capacitors to the reference voltage. Another controllable switch (M2) is connected in circuit between the inverting input terminal and the output terminal for selectively short-circuiting the capacitors in order to reset the amplifier integration function.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electric signal
amplification circuits and, more particularly, to a
programmable gain amplifier which may include an
integrating preamplifier in a single circuit.EP-A-0 072 741 discloses a combined programmable gain and integrating amplifier comprising an operational amplifier, a plurality of capacitors and a plurality of controllable switching means.In some applications such as, for example,
computerized tomography (CT) data acquisition systems
(DAS), analog amplifiers are used to amplify small
signals to within a predetermined range before
coupling the signals to an analog-to-digital (A/D)
converter. Amplifying the signals lowers the
resolution needed by the A/D converter. U.S. Patent
No. 4,815,118, issued March 21, 1989 and assigned to
the assignee of the present invention, provides a
discussion of programmable gain amplifiers and their
use in CT data acquisition systems. As described
therein, such programmable gain amplifiers have
employed resistor switching or have used a plurality
of amplifiers in parallel, each having a different
gain and being individually selectable for a different
gain setting. These prior art amplifiers have a
settling time after a gain select, which is
undesirable, and may also exhibit thermal and
switching noise that can detrimentally affect circuit
response.The present invention provides a combined
programmable gain and integrating amplifier as described by claim 1, and a corresponding method as described by claim 6. This amplifier with noise compensation
is suitable for amplifying relatively small signals of
the type developed in CT scans. In an illustrative
form, the input signal is developed from charge 
transfer from a photodiode in a CT detection circuit
in which a full scale charge on the photodiode is
about 200 picocoulombs. The amplifier circuit
incorporates an operational amplifier having a
plurality of capacitors connectable in parallel
between an inverting input terminal and an output
terminal. A plurality of controllable switches are
connected in circuit with the capacitors and arranged
to selectively connect the capacitors between the
amplifier terminals or between one of the terminals
and a reference potential. A reset switch connected
between the input and output terminals is selectively
actuatable for short-circuiting the capacitors and
dissipating any residual charge prior to applying an
input signal to the amplifier. The circuit may also
include a noise compensating capacitor selectively
connectable between the reference
