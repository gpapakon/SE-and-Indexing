<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, in order to assemble a first component (2) and a second component (4), at least one carpet (6) of balls (8) is formed on the first component, the balls having substantially the same height, being spaced from one another and being fixed to the first component, at least one drop of an adhesive (10) able to adhere to the components is poured onto this carpet, the components are placed in contact with one another, in such a way that the adhesive adheres to the second component, and the adhesive is dried. Application to assembling integrated circuits.

<CLAIMS>
Method of joining together a first component
(2, 16) and a second component (4, 18), this method

comprising the following steps:

balls (8) are formed on the first component, these
balls having approximately the same height and being

fixed to the first component,
at least one drop of an adhesive (10) capable of
adhering to the first and second components is poured

onto the first component,
the first and second components are brought into
contact with each other so that the adhesive adheres

to the second component, and
the adhesive is dried in order to fix the first and
second components to each other,

characterized in that the balls form at least one mat
(6, 20) in which they are spaced apart with a defined

spacing and the adhesive is poured onto each mat, the
spacing with which the balls are distributed in the mat

being tailored to the viscosity of the adhesive in
order to allow this adhesive to be retained in the mat

by capillary effect, this adhesive thus spreading out
over this mat and remaining confined therein by

capillary effect.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the adhesive (10) is electrically insulating.
Method according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the height of the balls (8) is

chosen to lie within the range from 4 µm to 100 µm. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the balls (8) are distributed in

the mat (6, 20) with a spacing greater than the
diameter of the balls and is chosen to lie in the range

from 10 µm to 150 µm.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the adhesive (10) is poured onto

the mat (6, 20) by means of a microsyringe.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the mat forms a ring (20), this

mat delimiting a central region devoid of balls so
that, after the first component (16) and the second

component (18) have been fixed to each other, the
inside (22) of this ring is insulated from the outside

(24) of the latter.
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in
that the first component (16) and the second component

(18) are brought into contact with each other and the
adhesive (10) is dried under a defined pressure so

that, after the first and second components have been
fixed to each other, the inside (22) of the ring

remains under this defined pressure.
