<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to thermoplastic polymer alloy compositions 
which exhibit excellent low temperature properties coupled with heat and 
scuff resistance and to a process for producing such compositions. For many years films and laminates of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins 
have found utility in the production of thermoformed articles including, for 
example, videotape cases, food packaging, and beverage containers. In the 
automotive field PVC has been employed extensively in the fabrication of 
interior sheathing for automobiles, for example, in instrument panel skins, 
door panels, roof liners, and seat covers. Although performance has been 
adequate, there are certain disadvantages inherently associated with use of 
PVC in these applications. In particular, large amounts of plasticizers must 
be incorporated into the resin in order to enhance flexibility and low 
temperature properties, as well as to provide a soft surface texture. 
However, as a result of the high temperatures to which the interiors of 
parked automobiles are subjected, the plasticizers have a tendency to migrate 
to the surface of the PVC films and consequently the PVC sheathing 
becomes brittle. In addition, a film of plasticizer is gradually deposited on the 
interior surfaces of the automobile, particularly on the interior surfaces of 
the windows. A more recently recognized disadvantage of the use of PVC concerns 
the difficulty of disposal and recycle of the resin. Incineration results in 
generation of significant quantities of hydrogen chloride and heavy metal 
residues. In addition, the resin is not compatible with other plastics used in 
the manufacture of automobiles, thereby creating problems during recycling 
operations. Non-halogenated thermoplastic alloy compositions having good high 
temperature properties are known in the art, for example the 
polyolefin/ionomer blends disclosed in U.S.-A-4,871,810 or the blends of 
partially crosslinked ethylene/alpha-olefin copolymers with reaction products 
of ethylene copolymer ionomers and olefin/epoxy copolymers, disclosed in 
U.S.-A-4,968,752. Such compositions, however, are either deficient in 
softness or scuff resistance. Consequently there is a need in the art, especially in the automotive 
field, for a material which combines the low and high temperature resistance  
 
properties of plasticized PVC, can be recycled easily, and exhibits scuff 
resistance and softness equal or superior to that of plasticized PVC. In accordance with this invention thermoplastic alloys
