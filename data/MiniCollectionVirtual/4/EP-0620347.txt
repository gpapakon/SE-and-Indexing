<ABSTRACT>
A pivot hinge assembly to pivot a glass structure (20) 
such as a shower door includes a hinge member (26) having a 

pivot pin (46) projecting therefrom and secured thereto, the 
pin (46) being generally cylindrical but having two opposed 

flat surfaces (52) formed thereon and protruding into a bore 
(82) in a central block (74) which joins two flat plates (62, 

64) between which is clamped the glass structure, said plates 
(62, 64) and block (74) constituting a further hinge member 

(60) of the assembly, a plurality of parallel bores (104, 110) 
being formed in the block (74) perpendicular to, to intersect, 

the bore (82) and each containing pressure assemblies (118) 
to press on the flat surfaces (52) on the pivot pins (46) and 

bias the hinge assembly to a closed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hinge assemblies 
adapted for 
use with glass panes, used especially in shower doors and other glass 
structures. Document US-A-2 191 900 discloses a hinge 
assembly having the features of the preamble of claim 1. Hinge assemblies for glass doors are usually of the kind 
shown in US patent 5,079,798 issued 14 January 1992. Such 
hinge assemblies are placed on the edges of glass doors and 
are oriented in a vertical plane, to support the weight of the 
glass doors. A disadvantage of this type of hinge assembly 
is that it can exert undue stress on the glass, causing it to 
crack, and in addition it can be difficult to mount the fixed 
part of the hinge unless there is a sufficient structural 
support backing up the fixed part of the hinge. In practice, 
the fixed part of the hinge is usually attached through tile, 
marble or artificial stone, and unless there is a structural 
support behind this material, the fixed part of the hinge will 
not be adequately secured. In addition, the large hinges 
located along the height of the door are unsightly. To deal with this kind of problem, in some cases hinges 
are placed at the bottom and top of a shower door or the like, 
with their pivot pins extending vertically toward the top and 
bottom edges of the door, as shown in US patent 4,035,957 
issued 19 July 1977. With the arrangement shown in US patent 
4,035,957, the bottom hinge bears the weight of the door as 
a compressive force. Thus, the door is not hung on its edge,  
 
thereby reducing the likelihood that the door will crack. In 
addition, there is usually a structural support available 
below the bottom fixed hinge portion, facilitating 
installation of the hinges. The hinges, being at the top and 
bottom of the door, are somewhat out of the way visually and 
are usually less unsightly. A disadvantage of the kind of hinge shown in US patent 
4,035,957 is that it has not in the past been possible to 
provide in a simple way any self closing or detent features 
for such hinges. In some cases such hinges have been built 
with friction drums, but these simply make the door stiffer 
to open and close and do not provide any self closing forces. 
Therefore, shower doors which use top and bottom hinges have 
usually employed gravity forces for self closing. However 
this makes installation of the door more difficult, since it 
must be oriented at the correct angle, and in addition a 
stopper is needed on the door, usually in the form of a magnet 
or latch. This increases the cost.

A hinge assembly for glass panes comprising: 

a) a first hinge member (60) adapted to be clamped to 
the glass pane (20) and comprising: 


first and second plate portions (62, 64) each having a 
face (72,76) in use lying on a respective side of said 

glass pane (20) opposing each other, said opposing faces 
(72,76) lying parallel with one another and to the plane 

of the glass pane (20) and whereby an edge (70A) of each 
of said plate portions (62,64) lies in a common plane 

(70) perpendicular to said opposing faces (72,76), 
a block portion (74) adapted to lie between said plate 
portions (62, 64), in use the block portion (74) being 

connected to said plate portions (62,64) and being 
located in a cutout (86) of the glass pane (20) whereby 

a flat end surface (70B) of said block portion (74) lies 
in said common plane (70), said flat end surface (70B) 

thereby being flush with said edges (70A) of said first 
and second plate portions (62,64), said block portion 

(74) having first and second side surfaces (100, 102) 
opposing each other and extending at right angles to 

said flat end surface (70B) and to the planes of said 
parallel opposed faces (72,76) of said plate portions 

(62,64), 
said block portion (74) being of smaller lateral 
dimensions than those of said plate portions (62,64) 

such that the said first and second side surfaces 
(100,102) of the block portion (74) being connected to 

the first plate portion (62) are recessed inwardly from 
a respective side edge of the first plate portion (62),
