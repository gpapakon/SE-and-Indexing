<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide an ergonomical and practical, handle-equipped universal striking tool with exchangeable tool bits for use when centre-punching, driving cotter pins and nail heads and driving in clips of various kinds, i.e. for such activities where today a hammer is used for striking a separate thumb-grip held object or separate, thumb-grip held tools. The problems with the earlier known technique are a.o. inferiour accessibility, tool instability, inferior view, impact injury risks and overloading of the hand, and the problems of looking after a complete tool kit. This object is achieved in accordance with the present invention by a handle (1), which at least at one end is equipped with an at least in one plane pivotably arranged driver head socket (2), to which a driver head (3) is attached, said driver head socket being pivotably and lockably arranged in said handle. Exchangeable striking tool bits (10) for different work assignments are easily fitted to said driver head, and extra tool bits are magazined in said handle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hand-held tool holder for holding a
tool subjected to striking forces according to the
pre-characterising portion of claim 1. A tool holder of this
type is known from the document DE-B-1 266 247.When working with conventional nail drivers, centre punches,
mandrels and similar tools, intended for striking
with a hammer, and when nailing various types of cable
clips etc., one is confronted with a number of problems:
Limited access.The tool (or the clip, the nail etc.) can only be
held in a thumb grip.The hand blocks the view of the tool and/or the object
to be driven in and precision is impaired.The lack of view and the instability of the tool make
it easy to cause impact damage on the hand and on
the object.Stressing of hand muscles may - during prolonged
work - cause occupational injuries.By e.g. nail-drivers, centre-punches and other applications,
each tool can only handle a very limited
range of dimensions.Problems are encountered in equipping oneself with,
and looking after, a complete tool kit for a certain
work assignment at hand, due to the many separate
tools.Some attempts have been made before to improve the situation.
GB-A-2 171 342 shows a centre punch mounted in a
transversal bar that can be used as a handle for the
centre punch, but the handle at the same time functions
as a chuck wrench and is not very ergonomically shaped. DE-B-1 266 247 reveals a tool-holder comprising an elongate
handle housing different tools in a row of recesses covered
by a pivotable shell. one end of which holds a driver head,
beneath which the handle carries an exchangeable tool.US-A-5 138 917 concerns a holder for a chisel or the like
and includes a fixed jaw member, generally in the shape of
the letter C, one arm of which defines a threaded aperture
for mating with a threaded shaft, the throughgoing end of
which bears against the perimeter of a tool. Also US-A-640 696 shows a device where a centre punch or
chaser punch has been equipped with a side handle. This
tool is however shaped for one single, special purpose
and solves very few of the problems listed above.Furthermore, through DE-B-1 266 247 a hand-held tool is
known, having exchangeable tool bits attached in a fixed
position at approximately right angles to the longitudinal
axis of the handle. This device is however only intended
for nail countersinking and is not equipped for
universal use. Access is limited by all the nail drivers
being attached at a fixed angle relative to the handle.
Furthermore, only one nail driver at a

A hand-held tool
holder for holding a tool

subjected to striking forces in its axial direction,
said tool holder comprising a handle extending

in a mainly transversal direction
relative to the axial striking direction,


characterized
 in that said handle (1) at
least at one end is equipped with an at least in one

plane pivotably arranged driver head socket (2), in
which a driver head (3) is affixed,

in that one end of said driver head (3) is designed
gas an impact area (23) and in that it's middle portion

is designed with an attachement device (14) for
attachment to a corresponding device (12,13) in said

driver head socket (2), whereas it's other end comprises
an attachment device (15) for easily exchangeable

tool bits (10), and in that said pivoting driver head
socket (2) can be locked at different angles relative to the handle (1). 
A tool holder according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the easily exchangeable tool bits (10) at one
end have a device (16) for quick attachment to the

attachment device (15) of the driver head (3) and at
their other end have a tooling surface (24).
A tool holder according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that one pivoting plane of the driver head socket
(2) coincides with the longitudinal axle of the

handle (1). 
A tool holder according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the pivoting and locking functions of said driver
head socket (2) has been achieved by designing

one axle neck (4) of the driver head socket (2) like
a tooth-rimmed push-and-turn knob, said knob (4) normally

being held, through the action of a coil spring
(9) axially compressed between the bottom of a spring

housing (8) in an opposite axle neck (21) and a recess
(25) in one handle half (17), with it's sparse

teeth (6) interlocked with corresponding sparse teeth
(7) fixedly arranged in the other handle half (17),

whereas, when the knob (4) is pushed inwards against
the spring force, the teeth (6) on the driver head

socket (2) are displaced out of interlock with the
teeth (7) inside said handle half (17), whereby the

driver head socket (2) can be pivoted freely to a
wanted position relative to the handle (1), whereupon,

when the pressure on said knob (4) is released,
said sparse teeth (6) on the knob (4) are again

pushed into interlock with said teeth (7) inside said
handle half (17) and the driver head socket (2) is

locked in a new angular position.
A tool holder according to claim 4, 
characterized

in that said two handle halves (17) are identical in
shape and are mounted against each other with one

half turned 180 degrees relative to the other, thereby
creating two identical locations, each for one

driver head socket (2), and in that the handle (1)
has driver head sockets (2) fitted at both handle

ends. 
A tool holder
according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that said handle (1) is equipped with magazines
(11) for tool bits (10) and with holding devices (22)

for retaining said tool bits in said magazines.
