Conveyor device for sweets, with a gripper wheel (1), which 
rotates about a stationary centre axle (8) and comprises a housing 

(7) with a plurality of pivotable, cam-controlled retaining jaw pairs 
(3), for the picking up and transferring of the sweets (B), which are 

separated from a continuous mass strand by a cutting device, at a 
transfer wheel (6), wherein the retaining jaws (22, 27) of each 

retaining jaw pair (3) are mounted coaxially relative to one another 
and to be pivotable in common, characterised thereby that a pivot 

axis (X) of a pivot control transmission device for the retaining jaw 
pair (3) and a pivot axis (Y) for the retaining jaws (22, 27) of the 

clamping jaw pair (3) are arranged on an arc (K) with an equal radius 
(R) of rotation relative to the stationary centre axle (8) as pivot 

centre, wherein a relative position of the one pivot axis (X) to the 
other pivot axis (Y) on the arc (K) is settable and a central pivot 

control cam (10) for derivation of a pivot movement of the retaining 
jaw pair (3) is located on the central centre axle (8) and adjustable 

in circumferential direction relative thereto. 
Conveyor device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
the pivot axis (X) of the pivot control transmission device is formed 

by a shaft (14) mounted to be rotatable in a positioning ring (9), 
wherein the positioning ring (9) is located on the stationary centre 

axle (8) to be adjustable in circumferential direction. 
Conveyor device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby 
that the pivot control cam (10) is connected with an actuating device 

for the lockable adjustment in circumferential direction and with a 
setting scale (11) readable at the housing (7). 
Conveyor device according to at least one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby that the pivot control cam (10) 

is a double cam. 
Conveyor device according to at least one of the preceding 
claims 2 to 4, characterised thereby that the shaft (14) is rotatably  

 
mounted by a middle portion in the positioning ring (9) and has at 

its opposite ends at one end a roller lever (13) with rollers (12) 
for engagement with the pivot control cam (10) and at the other end a 

limb (15) of the pivot control transmission device. 
Conveyor device according to at least one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby that the pivot control 

transmission device has, for the pivot control of the retaining jaw 
pair (3) and apart from the roller lever (13) of the shaft (14), the 

shaft (14) and the limb (15), a connecting element (17) which is 
rotatably coupled with the limb (15) by a spigot (16) and which is 

rotatably mounted at its opposite end by a further pin (18), wherein 
the pin (18) is in turn rotatably mounted in a limb (19), which is 

rigidly connected with a hollow shaft (20) which is pivotably mounted 
in the housing (7) and rigidly connected outside the housing (7) with 

a carrier arm (21) of the inner retaining jaw (22) of the retaining 
jaw pair (3). 
Conveyor device according to claim 6, characterised thereby that 
the pivot control transmission device comprises a shaft (23), which 

is mounted in the hollow shaft (20) to be axially displaceable and is 
pivotable in common with the hollow shaft (20) and with which at one 

end a carrier arm (26) of the outer clamping jaw (27) of the clamping 
jaw pair (3) is fastened outside the housing (7) and which has at its 

inwardly disposed end a lever arm (24), which is rigidly fastened on 
the shaft (23) and carries at its free end a pin (25) which engages 

axially displaceably and resiliently biassed in a bore of the limb 
(19) rigidly fastened on the hollow shaft (20), for locking with the 

hollow shaft (20) in circumferential directions. 
Conveyor device according to claim 7, characterised thereby that 
the shaft (23) is acted on at the end face by an angle lever (29) by 

way of a pressure member (34), wherein the angle lever (29) is 
mounted to be pivotable and derives its pivot mounting about a 

fulcrum (30) from a control cam (33), which is fixed on the central 
centre axis (8), by means of a cam roller (32) mounted at the angle 

lever (29).  
 
Conveyor device according to at least one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 8, characterised thereby that the carrier arms (21, 26) 

of the retaining jaw pair (3) as well as the roller lever (13) are 
constructed as angle lever. 
Conveyor device according to at least one of the preceding 
claims 2 to 9, characterised thereby that there is provided a setting 

device for the positioning ring (9) with a pin (35), which is 
rotatably mounted at an end face in the housing (7), is connected 

with a setting scale (36) and has at its inner end an eccentrically 
arranged setting pin (38) in engagement with a recess (39) of the 

positioning ring (9). 
Conveyor device according to at least one of the preceding 

claims 1 to 10, characterised thereby that the outer retaining jaw 
(27) is shortened by a working width of a separating knife (5) of the 

cutting device (4) for the separating of the sweets (B) from the 
continuous mass strand and the inner retaining jaw (22) is lengthened 

by this working width as well as provided with a slot (40) for 
passage of the separating knife.
