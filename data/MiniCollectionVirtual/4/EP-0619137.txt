<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the production of fine-grained granules, a product melt (M) from a melt tank (2) is preferably supercooled and then metered or sprayed into a high-speed mixer (5) and brought into contact there with dry powder, powder mixtures or else centrifuged and then washed crystals (P) from a silo (6). As a result of crystallization, granules form which are discharged from the high-speed mixer (5) and are then dried and/or cooled in a drier (8), for example a moving-bed or fluidized-bed drier, and are then removed from the drier (8). Upstream of the cooling, the product melt (M) is mixed with a solvent (S) and as a result its viscosity is greatly decreased and its wettability with respect to the powder, crystals or powder mixtures (P) is significantly increased. Subsequently thereto, the product melt/solvent mixture is preferably supercooled to the metastable region of the solubility curve so that very rapid crystallisation begins in the high-speed mixer (5). The temperature of the product melt/solvent mixture is controlled in such a way that the mixture does not boil at the spray outlet (20) in the high-speed mixer (5).

Method for producing fine-grained granules, wherein a
product melt (M) from a melt tank (2) is cooled and then

dosed or sprayed in a high-speed mixer (5) and brought in
contact with dry powder, powder mixtures, or centrifuged

and subsequently washed crystals (P) from a silo (6),
whereby granules are formed by crystallization, which

granules are withdrawn from the high-speed mixer (5) and
then dried and/or cooled in a drier (8), for example a

fluidised bed drier and then removed from the drier (8),
characterized in that

the product melt (M) is mixed with a solvent (S) before
cooling, and thereby the viscosity of the product melt (M)

is greatly reduced and its wetting ability in relation to
the powder, the crystals or the powder mixtures (P) is

significantly increased,

the product melt/solvent mixture is cooled, so crystallisation
in the high-speed mixer (5) is effected swiftly, and

the temperature of the product melt/solvent mixture is
regulated such that the mixture in the high-speed mixer (5)

does not boil at the spray outlet (20).
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
product melt/solvent mixture is produced on-line as a

saturated solution by supercooling, whereby the product
melt/solvent mixture is supercooled by up to approximately

70Â°C starting from the solubility equilibrium temperature.
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that the
temperature of the saturated solution is maintained lower

than the boiling temperature of the solvent.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the mixing of the product melt (M) and the

solvent (S) is effected under high pressure, whereby an
overpressure of approximately 0 bar to approximately 5 bar 

is selected.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the mixing of the product melt (M) and the

solvent (S) is effected in a closed system without any gas
cushion.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the mixing of the product melt (M) and the

solvent (S) is effected in a static mixer (5).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that a polar solvent, for example methanol,

isopropanol or water, is used as the solvent (S).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the particle size of the granules is varied

by variation of the ratio of solvent (S) to product melt
(M).
Method according to claim 8, characterized in that the
ratio of solvent (S) to product melt (M) is regulated such

that the particle size of the granules is from approximately
0.15 mm to approximately 1 mm.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the product melt (M) is an antioxidant, a

stabilizer or a light stabilizer.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that by mixing the product melt (M) with the

solvent (S), the viscosity of the product melt is reduced
from, approximately 1,000 to over 100,000 mPas up to approximately

30 to 1.500 mPas, and that its wetting ability
in relation to the powder, the crystals or the powder

mixtures is significantly increased. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the product melt/solvent mixture is supercooled

in the metastable zone of the solubility curve.
