<ABSTRACT>
A rubber modified asphalt for use as a paving compound is formed by reacting very fine ground particulate rubber with paving grade asphalt and mixing the combination at between 300 and 400 degrees F. The resulting mixture reacts fully within 25 minutes or less to form a freely pouring mixture; the reacted mixture can be held at normal asphalt working temperatures for at least 96 hours without degradation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE OF THE INVENTIONIMPROVED RUBBER ASPHALT MIXTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to the field of rubber modified asphalts for use in sealing and paving materials.BACKGROUND ART It has long been recognized that the addition of particulate rubber to hot asphalt, where the rubber is blended and reacts fully or partially with the oils in the hot asphalt, provides a paving wear surface that has improved properties over that of asphalt alone as a paving material. In particular, rubber modified asphalts appear to have much longer effective lifetimes under a wide environmental condition, are less prone to the early development of stress cracking, and are more resistant to at least medium load traffic wear than plain asphalts, in addition, the rubber appears to have beneficial effects in reducing the evaporation of volatile oils from the asphalt, which is the principal predecessor to asphalt aging and failure, especially under the influence of heavy traffic, hot, dry climates, and excessive sunlight. It is now generally recognized that the initial success in using crumb sized rubber particles to mix with asphalt is in part due to the nature of the rubber used. Asphalts have long been recognized as having extremely varying properties depending upon the source petroleum from which they are derive, and these properties are largely dependent upon the nature of the complex heavy oil within the asphalt. Asphalt may in fact be blended and cut with various oils to improve 

their properties. A detailed description of the known prior art rubber asphalt mixtures and solution products is given in Huff, US Patent 4,166,049, incorporated by reference herein, which points out that the nature of the rubber type and the asphalt oil content has been considered material in the prior art coarse crumb rubber.Crumb rubber or particulate rubber is the product of reclamation processes, and has as a source material scrap rubber products.As a result, it is not a well defined material, and may consist of varying proportions of both natural rubbers and synthetic rubbers. Such rubbers are described more fully in Werner Hoffman, Rubber TechnoioÎ±v Handbook. Oxford University Press (1989) (English Trans.of Kautschuk-Technologie, 1980). Various natural and synthetic rubber compositions vary considerably in their solubility in various oils and solvents, and some are far more resistant to devulcanization, which must occur if the rubber is to react fully with asphalt. In the prior art, crumb rubber has generally only been widely available
