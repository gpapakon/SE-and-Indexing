<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for controlling the blade tip clearance in a rotating machine where the machine comprises a turbine part (1) and a compressor part (4) separate from the turbine part. The stator housing (15) of the turbine part is formed with a stator cone (16). The invention is characterized in that one or more bladed (5) turbine discs (2), during non-steady operation, for example during start-up, stop and load changes, are moved out of the stator cone such that the blade tip clearance is increased and that the turbine discs during continuous operation are moved into the stator cone such that the blade tip clearance is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rotating machine comprising a 
turbine part with at least one turbine disc attached to a 
rotor shaft where the outer part of the turbine disc in the 
form of a blade ring cooperates with a stator housing and 
where the turbine disc is connected via the rotor shaft to 
the rotor shaft of a compressor part. It is very important for the efficiency and performance of 
the turbine part that the distance, the clearance between 
the blade tips of the turbine disc and the stator housing of 
the turbine part, is as small as possible. This applies 
particularly to the continuous operating state in which the 
turbine is intended to be run. During start-up and load 
changes, the requirement for efficiency can be lowered. The elements comprised by the turbine part, for example 
rotor shaft, blades and stator housing, are heated and 
cooled differently rapidly during non-steady states, for 
example during start-up and load increases and during stop 
and load reductions. This is due to the fact that the 
elements have different mass and that they are influenced to 
a varying extent by the hot gas flow which passes through 
the turbine part. The heating of the elements results in 
linear expansion and deformations, which means that 
clearances between rotating and static elements during non-steady 
states are influenced. During the non-steady states, the blade tip clearance is 
reduced and can be completely eliminated if, in cold or in 
heated condition, it is chosen too small. This leads to 
contact and seizure, which is unacceptable. To avoid contact 
between rotating and static parts, a clearance between the  
 
blade tips and the turbine housing is chosen which is 
sufficiently large to prevent blade tip contact during 
start, stop and load changes and which is sufficiently small 
during continuous operation to prevent an unacceptably low 
efficiency. The clearance between the blade tips and the stator housing 
must thus be chosen on the basis of the operating state 
which gives the smallest permissible clearance taking into 
account the uneven temperature distribution, the extension 
of the blades because of the centrifugal force, etc. One way of reducing the blade tip clearance during continuous 
operation is to design the turbine such that expansion 
and deformation because of the temperature can be controlled 
by distributing the mass in the turbine such that 
movements and deformations are overcome or redistributed. Another way is to introduce operating restrictions to avoid 
the
