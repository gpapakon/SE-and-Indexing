<ABSTRACT>
Orthodontic appliances formed of a titanium alloy which 
substantially avoids toxic or allergic reactions in 

patients containing a β-stabilizing element including at 
least 12 wt% molybdenum to produce a stable β-monophase 

at body temperature are disclosed. The yield strength of 
the titanium alloy is within the range 1150 to 1450 MPa. 

The tensile strength of the titanium alloy is within the 
range 1350 to 1950 MPa. The elongation of the titanium 

alloy is within the range 10 to 14%. The titanium alloy 
may also contain about 5 wt% zirconium as another β-stabilizing 

element. It may also contain about 3 wt% 
aluminum to improve age hardenability by strengthening 

the α-phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to orthodontic appliances
adapted in the field of orthodontics for moving teeth in
a prescribed direction for the purpose of correcting
irregularities of the teeth, and more particularly to
orthodontic appliances made of a novel titanium alloy.Stainless steel has been the predominant alloy used in
orthodontic appliances. However, the nickel component of
stainless steel has a tendency to leach into saliva
inside the oral cavity. This may cause harmful
reactions, such as allergies and the like. Approximately
one in every 200 to 300 patients are known to be allergic
to nickel. Thus, there has been an effort to develop
orthodontic appliances that do not contain nickel.Recently, titanium has been considered as a substitute
for stainless steel. However, the use of titanium in
orthodontic appliances is not new. Titanium has been
used not only in dental materials, but also in medical
materials since the 1950s. Because of its affinity in
vivo, titanium has been used in implants and artificial
joints for years. Initially, pure titanium was used, but
this was not always satisfactory because even the
strongest grade had a yield strength of only 500 to 650
MPa (elongation 15%). In applications involving stress and in parts where
resistance is important, Ti-6Al-4V alloys have been used,
these being α + β type titanium alloys. Among these, Ti-6Al-4V-ELI
has often been used as a titanium alloy in
vivo. Ti-6Al-4V-ELI alloy was originally developed as a
refractory material by the aerospace engineering industry
before being used in vivo. This alloy decreases elution
of vanadium, aluminum and titanium molecules (corrosion
in industrial applications) by suppressing impurities to
an extremely low level. The 0.2% yield strength of Ti-6A1-4V-ELI
is 800 MPa (elongation 6%) according to the
ASTM Surgical Implant Standard. Such a yield strength is
generally insufficient for use in current orthodontic
appliances where the trend is toward miniaturization and
higher yield strengths.Currently, Ti-6Al-4V-ELI is considered the most proximate
in vivo metal material. However, with this alloy there
is still elution of metal ions caused by reactions with
biologic saline water and organic acids in the oral
cavity. The vanadium (V) component of the alloy even in
minute amounts is an element that is non-degradable in
the human body. Under increased local concentrations its
valency increases together with oxidation which results
in toxicity to the central nervous system as well as cell
toxicity. Also, when the
