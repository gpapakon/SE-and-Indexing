<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a Class-II restriction 
endonuclease which recognizes a specific sequence of seven 
bases in a double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
molecule and cleaves said DNA molecule at specific sites. Restriction endonucleases are endonucleases that are 
capable of recognizing a specific sequence of bases in a DNA 
molecule and cleaving the DNA strands at specific sites. 
Many kinds of restriction endonucleases have so far been 
found. As a result of the progress in molecular genetics and 
biochemistry, DNA was proven to be the carrier of genetic 
information, and since then restriction endonucleases have 
been extensively used for various purposes, such as in the 
clarification of genetic diseases in gene manipulation. Among them, class II restriction endonucleases, which 
can recognize specific DNA sequence and digest the DNA 
strand specifically within the sequence, are especially 
important and essentially used in genetic engineering 
techniques. More than 300 class II restriction endonucleases have 
been isolated, however, many DNA sequences having no cognate 
restriction endonucleases (can not be recognized by any 
known restriction endonuclease) still remain. Therefore, it 
has been needed to make effort for discovering novel class  
 
II restriction endonucleases having ability to recognize and 
digest these sequences, so that researchers have more chance 
to cut their DNA at positions suitable for each experiment. Moreover, restriction endonucleases with low cutting 
frequencies are more convenient for structural analyses of 
high molecular weight DNA such as genome analysis projects 
of several living things, and the discovery of the class II 
restriction endonucleases recognizing long DNA sequences 
more than six bases have been demanded. The purpose of this invention is to provide a novel 
restriction endonuclease of class II having an ability to 
recognize and cut a new DNA sequence, which is suitable for 
genetic engineering research including the analysis of high 
molecular weight DNA. In a first aspect of this invention, there is 
provided a restriction endonuclease capable of specifically 
recognizing the nucleotide sequence of the following formula 
1 in a DNA molecule and specifically cleaving the same, 
(wherein A, G, T and C represent adenine, guanine, thymine  
 
and cytosine, respectively). In a second aspect of the this invention, there is 
provided the reagents to be used in the genetic engineering 
method containing the restriction endonuclease described
