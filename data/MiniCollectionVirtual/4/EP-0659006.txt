<ABSTRACT>
A computer workstation receives multiple audio input streams over a 
network in an audio conference. The audio input streams are kept separate 

by storing them in different queues. Digital samples from each of the 
queues are transferred to an audio adapter card 28 for output. A digital 

signal processor 46 on the audio adapter card multiplies each audio 
stream by its own weighting parameter, before summing the audio streams 

together for output. Thus the relative volume of each of the audio output 
streams can be controlled. For each block of audio data, the volume is 

calculated and displayed to the user, allowing the user to see the volume 
in each audio input stream independently. The user is also provided with 

volume control for each audio input stream, which effectively adjusts the 
weighting parameter, thereby allowing the user to alter the relative 

volumes of each speaker in the conference.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the processing by a computer 
workstation of multiple streams of audio data received over a network. Conventionally voice signals have been transmitted over standard 
analog telephone lines. However, with the increase in locations provided 
with local area networks (LANs) and the growing importance of multimedia 
communications, there has been considerable interest in the use of LANs 
to carry voice signals. This work is described for example in "Using 
Local Area Networks for Carrying Online Voice" by D Cohen, pages 13-21 
and "Voice Transmission over an Ethernet Backbone" by P Ravasio, R 
Marcogliese, and R Novarese, pages 39-65, both in "Local Computer 
Networks" (edited by P Ravasio, G Hopkins, and N Naffah; North Holland, 
1982). The basic principles of such a scheme are that a first terminal or 
workstation digitally samples a voice input signal at a regular rate (eg 
8 kHz). A number of samples are then assembled into a data packet for 
transmission over the network to a second terminal, which then feeds the 
samples to a loudspeaker or equivalent device for playout, again at a 
constant rate. One of the problems with using a LAN to carry voice data is that 
the transmission time across the network is variable. Thus the arrival of 
packets at a destination node is both delayed and irregular. If the 
packets were played out in irregular fashion, this would have an 
extremely adverse effect on intelligibility of the voice signal. 
Therefore, voice over LAN schemes utilise some degree of buffering at the 
reception end, to absorb such irregularities. Care must be taken to avoid 
introducing too large a delay between the original voice signal and the 
audio output at the destination end, which would render natural 
interactive two-way conversation difficult (in the same way that an 
excessive delay on a transatlantic conventional phone call can be highly 
intrusive). A system is described in "Adaptive Audio Playout Algorithm 
for Shared Packet Networks", by B Aldred, R Bowater, and S Woodman, IBM 
Technical Disclosure Bulletin, p 255-257, Vol 36 No 4, April 1993 in 
which packets that arrive later than a maximum allowed value are 
discarded. The amount of buffering is adaptively controlled depending on 
the number of discarded packets (any other appropriate measure of 
lateness could be used). If the number of discarded packets is high, the  
 
degree of buffering is increased, whilst if the number of discarded 
packets is low, the degree of buffering is decreased.
