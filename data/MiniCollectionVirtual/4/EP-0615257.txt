<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a laminated structure (1) comprising a substrate 
(3) and a polymer layer (5). The polymer layer consists of conductive areas (7) having a 

sheet resistance of maximally 1000 Ω/sqaure. The adjacent parts of the polymer layer 
are substantially non-conductive and have a sheet resistance which is a factor of 10⁶ 

higher. An electrodeposited metal layer (9), for example of copper, is present on the 
conductive areas (7). 
A description is also given of a simple method of photochemically 
generating the conductive pattern (7) which can be reinforced in an aqueous metal-salt 

solution by electrodeposition of a metal layer (9). A description is given of, 
inter alia
, 
the patterned exposure of a layer of 3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene or polyaniline. The 

method can very suitably be used for the manufacture of metal patterns on insulating 
substrates, such as printed circuit boar

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a laminated structure.Structures obtained using such a method are used as printed circuit boards, in which a metal
layer (mostly copper) is provided in accordance with the desired conductive track
pattern. A substrate material is used which is made of, for example, synthetic resin, a
composite material such as glass fibre/epoxy, paper/phenolic resin or ceramic. The
substrate material is generally flat and plate-shaped, although it may alternatively be
formed by a flat or curved form of, for example, the synthetic resin housing of a
domestic appliance or shaver.A printed circuit board can be manufactured by providing a substrate with
a copper foil via an adhesive layer. The copper foil is provided with a photoresist layer
and, in succession, exposed to patterned radiation and developed, whereafter the
undesired copper is removed in a chemical etching bath. For reasons relating to the
protection of the environment, this method is less desirable. In accordance with another
method, the substrate, which is non-conductive, is provided with a copper layer in an
electroless process. To this end, the substrate is first activated with a noble metal, such
as palladium, and then immersed in an electroless metallization bath. Such a bath
contains an aqueous solution of, inter alia, a copper salt, a complexing agent such as
EDTA, and a reducing agent such as formaldehyde. The copper layer provided in an
electroless process is generally reinforced with a copper layer applied by means of
electrodeposition. In this process an external current source is used to electrodeposit
copper onto the copper layer forming the cathode from an aqueous copper-salt solution.However, electroless metallization has the drawback that the activation is
non-selective, so that the deposited uniform copper layer must subsequently be provided
with a pattern in a photolithographic process and by means of chemical etching, which 
is very laborious. Another drawback is that expensive noble metals (such as palladium)
are necessary to activate the substrate surface and that the metallization baths used
readily become instable. Moreover, said metallization baths contain toxic components
such as the above-mentioned complexing and reducing agents.A method of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph is
known from an article by S. Gottesgeld et al. in J. Electrochem. Soc. Vol. 139, No. 1,
L14 (1992). Using the known method, a structure is manufactured by providing a substrate with an

A method of manufacturing a laminated structure comprising the steps of:

a) providing an electrically insulating substrate;
b) applying a solution of an electrically conducting polymer and a
photochemical radical generator on the electrically insulating substrate to form a layer

of said polymer with a sheet resistance of maximally 1000 Ω/square;
c) irradiating the polymer layer, thereby forming a pattern of areas of
substantially non-conductive polymer whose sheet resistance is at least a factor of 10

A method of manufacturing a laminated structure as claimed in Claim 2,
characterized in that a layer of a solution comprising conductive polyaniline, a

photochemical radical generator and a solvent is provided on the substrate, whereafter
the layer is exposed to patterned radiation, thereby forming substantially non-conductive

polymer in the exposed areas, and then heated, after which the metal layer is
electrodeposited onto the conductive polyaniline from a metal-salt solution.
