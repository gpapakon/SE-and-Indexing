<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a series of bi-directional 
aseptic volume filler cylinders (22), that are able to provide 

measured volume fillers as the piston (25) is driven in both 
directions by providing an aseptic disk valve (34) which is able to 

direct material in the desired directions. Both sides of the 
chamber are able to draw material from a single passage (29,31) and 

out put material to a single passage (30,32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for providing a measured volume 
of material, a valve suitable for such an apparatus and a method of 
dispensing measured volumes of material. DE-C-823 555 discloses a multiway-valve construction in particular for the 
use in pressure air brake arrangements, door closing devices and pressure 
air wipers having at least three connecting channels and a pressure 
fluid passage. From the channels transverse bores extend to a slide valve 
face. The transverse bore for guiding the inflowing pressure fluid is 
provided on the slide valve axis whereas the other bores are provided 
on a circle line which is concentric to this axis. The slide valve face in 
turn has a circle segment groove and a radial control groove starting 
from the center thereof. Accordingly it is possible to establish different 
connections between the transverse bores in dependence from the particular 
position of the valve disk in regard to the bore housing. From DE-U-88 08 143 an apparatus for portioned filling liquids of 
different viscosities into packages is known. A piston is reciprocating 
within a chamber having a common inlet and a common outlet communicating 
with each other. In dependence of the motion direction of the 
piston a corresponding section line provides an associated output line 
with a specific material volume. The invention provides a bi-directional asseptic volume filler apparatus 
which is sterilizable and CIP able and which provides a predetermined 
volume of material as a piston moves in either direction during its stroke.  
 The invention provides a valve as defined in claim 1, and an apparatus as 
characterized in claim 2. The features of the inventive method for 
dispensing measured material volumes are mentioned in claim 6. Further advantageous developments are included in the dependent claims.
