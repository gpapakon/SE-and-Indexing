<ABSTRACT>
An object of the invention is to provide an 
apparatus which is simple in construction without 

the need of a motor and the like and is capable of 
easily and positively getting an umbrella received into 

an umbrella cover. To this end, the apparatus for 
getting an umbrella received into an umbrella cover 

according to the invention comprises a body (1) for 
receiving a number of umbrella covers, a movable 

support member (11) vertically movably provided in 
the body (1), a foot-operated pedal (16) for moving the 

movable support member downward, and an opening 
operating lever (22) for opening the opening portion of 

the umbrella cover by interlocking with the downward 
movement of the movable support. As a result, it is 

possible according to the invention to easily get an 
umbrella received into an umbrella cover. Also, since 

any motor and the like are not used unlike usual cases, 
it is possible to reduce manufacturing cost and to use 

the present apparatus even in a place where any power 
supply is not available. Besides, the present appa
ratus 
is quite practical because any power cable does not 

interfere with our movements and there is no fear of 
leakage of electricity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a storage device for wet
umbrellas that automatically wraps an umbrella and
places it in a sack. It can be used, for example, at
entrances of hotels, shops and department stores, so
that when it is raining, wet umbrellas can be adequately
handled and stored.When it is raining, synthetic resin sacks (plastic
sacks) have traditionally been used to wrap wet
umbrellas in order to avoid wetting clothes, floors or
goods, while customers walk around inside hotels, shops
or department stores with their wet umbrellasA wide variety of devices, which can open the openings
of storage sacks automatically and store umbrellas by
just inserting them into the openings, have been
proposed to ease their smooth storage. For example,
such devices are proposed in Japanese Patent Application
No. JP-A-60-134817, Japanese Utility Model Publication No.
62-125708 and Japanese Patent Application No. JP-A-4-31222.In the prior art mentioned above, it has been necessary
to include suction means and a number of links and/or
cam mechanism in order to provide a means for opening
each storage sack, and therefore, the prior art
constructions were generally complex.At the same time, since a vacuum pump or a motor is
used, the production cost is high, and such devices
cannot be used where a power source is not positioned
near the installed devices. Furthermore, power cords
are a hindrance and there is a danger of a short circuit
occurring when these devices are operated when it is
raining. Furthermore, since in the prior art, a number of storage
sacks are simply piled up to fill them in the storage
device, it is often difficult to store them due to them
becoming disordered. Consequently, extra labour or
other connected costs are involved in carrying or
retaining such storage sacks before they are used in the
storage device.It is known from JP-A-4-31229 to provide a storage device
for umbrella sacks
in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 and
comprising a device body for storing
a plurality of storage sacks.The present invention is characterised by a vertically
movable support member arranged in the device body; a
foot pedal which is connected to said movable support
member in order to lower it when the foot pedal is
depressed; and opening levers pivotally mounted to said support
member for insertion into and subsequent opening of said
opening in said foremost sack upon downward movement of the
movable support member.In accordance with the present invention, a number of
storage sacks may be stored in a box and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A storage device for umbrella sacks comprising a
device body (1) for storing a plurality of storage sacks

(5;104) having an opening in their upper
part (5a;104a), and means (22;222;328)

for opening the opening of the foremost one of said storage sacks 
characterised by a vertically movable support member

(11;114;214) arranged in the device body; a foot pedal
(16;217) which is connected to said movable support

member in order to lower it when the foot pedal is
depressed; and opening levers (22;222;328) pivotally mounted to

said support member for insertion into and subsequent
opening of said opening (5a;104a) in said foremost sack upon

downward movement of the movable support member (11;114;214).
A storage device for umbrella sacks according to
claim 1 including a plurality of storage sacks (5;104)

in a box (105) placed in the device body (1).
A storage device for umbrella sacks according to
claim 2 wherein said plurality of storage sacks (5;104)

are suspended from a hanger (107) in said box.
A storage device for umbrella sacks according to
claim 1, 2 or 3, comprising a pair of separate opening

levers (22;222) to move and rotate independently with
respect to said movable support member (11;114;214); and

means (25;224) for rotating each of said opening levers
in such a direction so as, in use, to contact a storage

sack (5;104) stored in the device body (1).
A storage device for umbrella sacks according to
claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said opening levers are

integrally formed on a substantially 'C'-shaped member
(328).
