<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a plated steel sheet with a Zn-Cr composite 
plating, which is preferably used for automobiles, 
excellent in corrosion resistance and glossiness. Various countermeasures have been taken for painting 
and vehicle body designs to increase the corrosion 
resistance of automobile bodies. A rustproof steel 
sheet is mainly used at present in view of reliability 
in rustproof performance over long periods of time. Among rustproof steel plates, a zinc-plated steel 
sheet or a zinc alloy-plated steel sheet is most frequently 
used. However, the development of a thin 
corrosion-resistant steel sheet which is capable of 
satisfying both requirements of low cost and high corrosion 
resistance has been desired. As the most promising coatings to achieve the above 
object, Zn-Cr composite platings disclosed in Jpn. Pat. 
Appln. KOKOKU Publication No. 2-51996 and Jpn. Pat. 
Appln. KOKAI Publication Nos. 64-55397, 64-55398, 
64-79393, and 3-240994 are exemplified. In these Zn-Cr 
composite platings, the corrosion inhibition effect by 
Cr present in the coatings is typical to provide a high 
corrosion resistance. Such a Zn-Cr composite plating is 
not passivated and maintains a relative base potential. 
For this reason, the so-called sacrificing corrosion 
protecting action is valid for a long period of time,  
 
and the Zn-Cr composite plating has a high corrosion 
resistance in a situation where the underlying steel is 
exposed. However, at a joint portion of a steel sheet, 
unlike a thick plating material, the Zn-Cr composite 
plating cannot be expected to fill the joint portion of 
a corrosion product. The joint portion of the steel 
sheet is exposed to a relatively severe, nonuniform 
environment in which the dry and wet conditions repeat. 
Even if the Zn-Cr composite plating is formed on the 
steel sheet, the resultant steel product has a lower 
corrosion resistance than that of a hot-dip plated steel 
sheet with a thick plating film. Although the Zn-Cr composite plating has a high 
potential for excellent corrosion resistance, no conventional 
coatings which manifest such performance have 
been proposed. An oxide layer is present on the surface of a Zn-Cr 
composite plating according a conventional method. 
Glossiness is not necessarily satisfactory due to the 
oxide layer. Since the thickness of the oxide layer 
easily changes depending on manufacturing conditions, 
the surface oxide layer becomes thick depending on plating 
conditions, and the
