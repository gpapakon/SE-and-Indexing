<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of phosphating 
metal surfaces, and more specifically, it relates to a 
treatment method for forming a phosphate coating on metal 
surfaces of a combination of iron steel and/or galvanized 
steel and an aluminum alloy. Conversion treatment of forming a phosphate coating, 
which is basically composed of zinc phosphate, on a metal 
surface for improving finishing in coating and a rust preventing 
function is generally well known in the art. While steel and galvanized steel are generally employed 
as metal materials which are subjected to conversion treatment, 
a material prepared by combining steel and/or galvanized 
steel with an aluminum alloy is recently employed in 
order to attain lightweightness in an automobile body or the 
like. Thus, awaited is a treatment method of simultaneously 
forming a phosphate coating which is basically composed of 
zinc phosphate on such a composite metal material, similarly 
to the conventional method. As to conversion treatment for such a metal material  
 
which is prepared by combining iron steel or galvanized 
steel with an aluminum alloy, each of Japanese Patent Laying-Open 
Nos. 63-15769 (1988) and 64-68481 (1989) discloses 
a treatment method employing a phosphate treatment solution 
containing a fluoride. In the technique disclosed in either 
gazette, however, it is impossible to form a homogeneous and 
excellent phosphate coating in any or all metal surfaces of 
the steel, the galvanized steel and the aluminum alloy, and 
no sufficient performance can be attained as a cation coating 
substrate. On the other hand, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 3-267378 
(1991) discloses a treatment method of forming a 
homogeneous phosphate coating on a structure which consists 
of steel, galvanized steel and an aluminum alloy while 
defining relations between the treatment temperature and 
amounts of fluorine ions and zinc ions. According to the 
method which is disclosed in this gazette, it is possible to 
form a homogeneous phosphate coating on metal materials of a 
combination of steel, galvanized steel and an aluminum 
alloy, thereby obtaining a conversion coating having excellent 
corrosion resistance. In recent years, however, awaited is a treatment method 
capable of forming a conversion coating having superior 
corrosion resistance, which exhibits excellent corrosion 
resistance also in a composite corrosion cycle test, being a  
 
severer corrosion resistance test. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
phosphatin
