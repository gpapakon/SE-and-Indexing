<ABSTRACT>
A packet conversion apparatus includes a detector (22) for 
detecting heads of transmission packet signals, a packetizer (21) 

responsive to the detecting means for packetizing the 
transmission packet signals by sequentially arranging them 

into one or more recording packets to specify positions of 
the prescribed number of transmission packets for one or more 

recording packets, a source (24) for supplying reserved data, and 

a combiner (23) for inserting the reserved data into a space of 
the recording packets where no transmission packet signals 

present.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packet conversion 
apparatus and a packet conversion system, and more 
particularly to packet conversion apparatus and system suited 
for use in a recording reproducing apparatus for recording 
transmission packet signals by converting the transmission 
packet format into a prescribed recording packet format. In a data communication field, a packet communication 
system which transmits information by breaking the 
information into blocks and adding additional information for 
identifying data has been so far adopted. In the digital 
visual communication, it is also attempted to transmit 
compressed image data by packetizing. FIGURES 1 and 2 are explanatory diagrams showing 
exemplified formats of transmission packets. FIGURE 1 shows an example of the transmission packet for 
use in transmission of data packets m, m+1, m+2, ... by 
sequentially arranging, but without synchronizing them with a 
prescribed sync signal. Each packet comprises a heador(H) 
for use in identifying data in the packet, transmission data 
and an error correction parity (P) for use in correcting 
errors in the packet. On the other hand, FIGURE 2 shows an example of 
transmission packet for use in transmission of packets M in  
 
synchronism with, for instance, a reference cycle of frames, 
etc, of video signals. In FIGURE 2, one frame is comprised 
of k packets of data corresponding to respective columns, and 
each data of the k packets is comprised of a header H, 
transmission data and an error correction parity P. Further, 
the heador H1 of the first packet (M = 1) also serves as the 
header for use in identifying an entire data of the k packets 
in the n-th frame. Further, the volume of header may vary 
according to its column position M. By the way, the volume of these packets and the recording 
unit of a recording apparatus may differ from each other. In 
this case, packet data are recorded by converting into a 
recording format. For instance, the Japanese Patent 
Application Tokkai-Hei 4-86181 titled as Recording 
Reproducing Apparatus discloses that transmitted packets are 
converted into recording packets with a recording format for 
VTRs. The recording packet disclosed in the Application 
Tokkai-Hei 4-86181 is comprised of a screen positional 
information MBA (Macro Block Address) and a sync block record 
start positional information MBP (Macro Block Pointer), both 
added into the transmission data in unit of a sync block. FIGURES 3 and 4 are block diagrams showing the 
construction of
