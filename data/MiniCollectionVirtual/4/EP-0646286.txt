<ABSTRACT>
Warpage in a bonded wafer is limited by maintenance of a stress compensation layer on the backside of the bonded wafer during device fabrication processing. One embodiment applies a sacrificial polysilicon layer over a stress compensation silicon dioxide layer for bonded silicon wafers. The fabrication processing consumes the polysilicon layer but not the stress compensation silicon dioxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic integrated
circuits and methods of fabrication, and, more particularly,
to a method of bonded wafer processing according to the preamble
of claim 1.The units "nich", "Angstrom" and "mil"
are used in the following specification.
The correspondance of these units is as
follows:
1 nich = 2.54 centimetres 1 Angstrom = 1A = 0,1 nanometre1 mil = 25.4 micrometres.Integrated circuits fabricated in
silicon-on-insulator substrates offer performance advantages
including freedom from latchup for CMOS structures, high
packing density, low parasitic capacitance, low power
consumption, radiation hardness, high voltage operation, and
the possibility of three dimensional integration. Indeed,
isolation trenches extending through the silicon layer down to
the insulation provide a simple approach to dielectric
isolation of integrated circuit devices. The sidewalls of such
trenches are coated with an insulator, usually silicon dioxide
("oxide"), and the remaining portion of trench opening, if any,
is filled with a filler which is usually polycrystalline
silicon. Diffused FN junctions can also be used for lateral
isolation.Additionally, silicon-on-insulator technology using
very thin films offers special advantages for submicron
devices. Scaling bulk devices tends to degrade their
characteristics because of small-geometry effects, such as
punch-through, threshold voltage shift, and subthreshold-slope
degradation. The use of silicon-on-insulator devices
suppresses these small-geometry effects. Therefore, even in
the submicron VLSI era, silicon-on-insulator technology can
offer even higher device performance than can bulk technology,
along with the inherent advantages of silicon-on-insulator.Silicon-on-insulator substrates may be fabricated in
various ways: a crystalline silicon layer may be formed over an  
existing oxide layer either by laser or strip heater
recrystalization of polysilicon deposited on the oxide or by
selective epitaxial silicon growth over the oxide. However,
the quality of such a silicon layer is generally inferior to
that normally associated with bulk silicon. Other approaches
form an oxide layer beneath an existing high quality silicon
layer either by oxidizing a buried porous silicon layer or by
oxygen ion implantation; however, such oxide is low quality and
the silicon top layer may be damaged during the oxide layer
formation.Another approach to silicon-on-insulator is wafer
bonding as described by J. Lasky et al., Silicon-On-Insulator
(SOI) by Bonding and
