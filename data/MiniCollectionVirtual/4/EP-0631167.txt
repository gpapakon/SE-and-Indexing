<ABSTRACT>
A head-up display includes 
an image display means and a hologram 

as reflection means for reflecting 
display beams emitted from the 

display, wherein an image is reflected 
inside a windshield and the 

image is formed at the front of, 
and outside, the windshield. Concave 

mirrors having different focal 
lenghts in different directions are 

recorded on the hologram as the reflection 
means so as to offset distortion 

of the display image resulting 
from the radius of curvature of 

the windshield. According to this 
construction, the display im
age free 
from distortion can be displayed on 

the windshield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image display
unit according to the preamble of claim 1, for displaying a virtual image, and more particularly, to
an image display apparatus used as in a heads-up display unit.A heads-up display unit, which enables a driver
visually monitor a meters or the like without averting his or
her eyes from the road, is known in the art. This device
projects an image of the meter onto the windshield, and forms
an image externally in front of the windshield through the
incidence of an image reflected by the windshield to the eyes
of the driver.However, such a display on the windshield causes
distortion of the virtual image because the windshield itself
is a curved surface having different curvatures in the
longitudinal and transverse directions. Furthermore, the
windshield is not always perpendicular to the display light.In addition, it is necessary to enlarge the display
light from the display because of the necessity of achieving
a compact display image forming means with a view to
downsizing the apparatus.As an example of solving these problems
JP-A-4-11525 discloses a method 
which provides a lens for correcting the distortion of the
image caused by the curved shape of the windshield, and
separately provides a lens that enlarges the display image
from the display unit.With such a construction in which a lens is
separately provided, the size of the entire apparatus becomes
large, and poses problems of image distortion caused by the
frequent passage of the display light through the lens and
losses in the tone clarity of the displayed image.The present invention was developed in view of the
circumstances as described above. A generic image display unit is known from EP-A-0 286 962 and
comprises: image forming means for forming a display image;
reflecting means for reflecting light emitted from said image
forming means; and display means for forming the display image
from light emitted from the image forming means and reflected
by the reflecting means, and having different curvatures in
longitudinal and transverse directions. The reflecting means
includes a hologram having recorded reflecting characteristics
in which focal lengths are different in the longitudinal and
transverse directions so as to correspond to the curvatures in
the longitudinal and transverse directions of said display
means.It is an object of the present invention to further develop an
image display unit according to the preamble of claim 1 such
that an enlargement of an image can be easily made with clear
