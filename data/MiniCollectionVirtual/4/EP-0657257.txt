<ABSTRACT>
A method of finishing a wooden surface (10). The method 
comprises applying to the surface a composition of a 

thermosetting adhesive and a mat (14). The mat comprises wood 
fibre, a thermosetting resin and at least one other fibre 

having a longer strand length than the wood fibre. Heat 
and pressure are applied sufficient to bond the 

components to each other and to the wooden surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of finishing a 
wooden surface. FR-A-2 667 264 discloses such a method. For the purpose 
of obtaining a smooth surface or a panel, solid rough 
wooden core layer is covered with a scrim and a mixture 
of wooden fibres and adhesive in a heated press. In any industry that involves the reduction in size of 
non-uniform materials at high speed, particularly in 
saw milling, the cutting action of the tool results in 
very rough surfaces and variable dimensions of the cut 
pieces. A saw mill cutting lumber to a nominal 
thickness of one inch will obtain actual thicknesses 
ranging from 0.5 to 1.25 inches. Laminating such pieces 
to produce larger members for structural or decorative 
applications requires that the pieces be planed to 
uniform thickness with smooth surfaces. Failure to 
finish in this way will prevent the application of an 
adhesive or the formation of a durable bond. The cost 
of processing the wood to obtain the requisite surface 
and the amount of waste generated are both high. The 
processing of nominal one inch lumber to meet the 
adhesion requirements can result in losses of wood 
fibre in the range 25 to 40 percent by weight of the 
original wood. The present invention seeks to provide a method of 
avoiding the above processing and thus the consequent 
waste. The invention seeks to avoid the waste involved in the 
above processing and is a method of finishing a wooden 
surface, said method being characterized in that the  
 
mixture comprises a thermosetting adhesive, and a 
prefabricated needled mat comprising in addition a 
wooden fibre, a thermosetting resin and at least one 
other fibre having a longer strand length than the wood 
fibre.  
 Although the present invention is useful in 
finishing any wooden surface, its preferred application 
is in the finishing of a rough wooden surface, such as 
would result from a saw cut. The thermosetting resin is preferably phenol-formaldehyde. 
However, other useful thermosetting 
adhesives include phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde resin, 
resorcinol-formaldehyde resin, urea-formaldehyde resin, 
melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin and melamine-formaldehyde 
resin. The wood fibre of the mat may be either mechanically 
refined without delignification or chemically refined 
with some degree of delignification. The wood fibre may 
be derived from virgin or recycled, including post-consumer, 
wood. In carrying out the manufacture of the 
wood mat, the fibre is treated with the thermosetting 
resin and dried. The dried,
