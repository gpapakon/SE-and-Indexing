<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a driver's cab series of modular construction with driver's cabs (1) of different lengths and heights and with different body extensions over the cabs, the driver's cab front wall (2) and the driver's cab rear wall (3) being identical components and the side walls (5) being of different heights. The height-variable driver's cab door (6) is of modular construction. In their lowest design the driver's cab series have a basic door (7) and all higher designs have a basic door (7) with a door top part (8) which is adapted to the top frame part (9) of the basic door (7) and is designed as a plug-in frame part, the basic door (7) and door top part (8) being of closed appearance.

<CLAIMS>
Cab model ranges of modular design with cabs of various lengths and 
heights and with different roof tops, the cab front and rear walls being 

identical parts and the side walls having different heights, characterised in 
that the cab doors (6) are of variable height and modular design. 
Cab model ranges according to Claim 1, characterised in that the lower 
version of the cab model ranges has a base door (7) and that all higher 

versions have a base door (7) with a door top adapted to the upper frame 
part (9) of the base door (7), which door top (8) is designed as a slot-in 

frame, base door (7) and door top (8) forming a complete whole. 
Cab model ranges according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the base 
door (7) and the slotted-in door top (8) are connected with each other by 

means of laser welding. 
Cab model ranges according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the base 
door (7) and the slotted-in door top (8) are glued together.
