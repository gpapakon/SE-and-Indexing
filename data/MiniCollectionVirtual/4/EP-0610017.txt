<ABSTRACT>
A poultry water feeder comprises a water feeder 
main body (3, 12), a plug (11) attached to the lower end of 

the main body and defining a water passage (14), a water 
feeder pin (15) fitted in the water passage defined by the 

plug to be vertically movable therein, the water feeder pin 
being tapered downward, and a valve (17) which normally 

closes the upper end of the water passage and opens it when 
the water feeder pin is raised.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a water feeder for use 
mainly in the poultry industry. The waters feeder systems used in poultry houses 
consist of a water supply pipe fitted with water feeders 
each having a feeder pin at its lower end. When a chicken 
lifts the tip of the feeder pin with its beak it is 
automatically supplied with water. Water feeders of this type are taught, for 
example, by Japanese Utility Model Public Disclosures Sho 
59(1984)-29179 and Hei 3(1991)-9150 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 
3,669,077 and 4,524,724. The water feeder according to U.S. Pat. No. 
4,524,724 is shown by way of example in Figure 7 of the 
attached drawings. The water feeder comprises a 
cylindrical housing 30 attached to a water supply pipe (not 
shown) and a plug 32 with an internal vertically movable 
feeder pin 31 is fitted into the lower opening of the 
housing 30. Inside the housing 30, a spherical valve 33 is 
pressed onto the top of the plug 32 by a small amount of 
water pressure and its own weight, thus sealing the upper 
opening of the plug 32 and closing off the supply of water. When a chicken raises the feeder pin 31 with its 
beak, the spherical valve 33 is raised to form a gap  
 
between the valve 33 and the edge of the upper opening of 
the plug 32. As a result, the low pressure water in the 
water supply pipe passes through the housing 30 and the 
plug 32 so that a drop of water forms on and falls from the 
pin 31. Although chicks require only a small amount of 
water at first, the amount they need increases gradually as 
they get larger. If the amount of water supply should 
become insufficient, the growth of a chick can be markedly 
stunted. With the prior art water feeders, since the 
practice has been to adjust the amount of water supplied to 
that appropriate for the chicks, such amount of water is 
insufficient for the fowl to prevent the fowl from fully 
growing. When the amount of water is adjusted for the 
fowl, however, there is a possibility of the chicks 
scattering excess water around the poultry house and, as a 
result, the floor of the poultry house gets wet. This 
promotes the propagation of bacteria and molds and thus 
increases the risk of the fowl contracting diseases. The 
amount of water supplied can be adjusted to some extent by 
regulating the water pressure, but this water supply 
adjustment has its own limitation. The problem with this is that the water spilled on 
the floor and remaining on the feeder pin 31 is scattered 
around the poultry house by the birds as they move about.

<CLAIMS>
A poultry water feeder comprising a water 
feeder main body (3, 12) adapted for connection with a 

water supply pipe (1), a plug (11) attached to the lower 
end of the main body and defining a water passage (14), a 

water feeder pin (15) fitted in the water passage defined 
by the plug to be vertically movable therein, and a valve 

(17) which normally closes the upper end of the water 
passage and opens it when the water feeder pin is raised, 

the poultry water feeder being characterized in that the 
water feeder pin is tapered downward. 
A poultry water feeder according to claim 1, 
wherein a portion of the-water feeder pin extending to the 

exterior of the plug is provided with means (19, 22) for 
preventing formation of a hanging drop of remaining water. 
A poultry water feeder according to claim 2, 
wherein the preventing means is a collar (19). 
A poultry water feeder according to claim 1, 
wherein the wall of the water passage is formed with a 

radially extending annular projection (18) for supporting 
the water feeder pin to be vertically movable, and the water 

feeder pin makes point contact with the water passage when it is tilted. 
A poultry water feeder according to claim 1, further 
comprising a feed amount adjustment pin (10) located above the valve. 
A poultry water feeder according to claim 5, wherein 
the feed amount adjustment pin has a lower portion tapered.
