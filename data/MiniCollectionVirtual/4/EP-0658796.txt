<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a camera provided 
with vibration detecting means for detecting the 
shaking of hands or the like. An interchangeable lens barrel, detachably 
mountable for example on a single-lens reflex camera, 
is equipped with a zooming mechanism for continuously 
varying the focal length of a phototaking optical 
system from a telephoto end to a wide-angle end, an 
auto focusing (AF) mechanism for automatic focusing to 
the object etc.. In particular the recent lens barrel is also 
equipped with an antivibration mechanism for 
compensating the shaking of the hands of the 
photographer, and is being developed toward multiple 
functions. Such lens barrel equipped with the antivibration 
mechanism is becoming further equipped, together with 
the above-mentioned progress toward the multiple 
functions, with a photo-optical system of various 
kinds, a driving mechanism and a control circuit 
therefor, and sensors for detection of various 
information, and, for this reason, the effective  
 
utilization of the space in the lens barrel is strongly 
desired for. The dimension of such lens barrel is determined, 
to a certain extent, by the diameter of the phototaking 
optical system to be incorporated therein, and an 
unnecessary increase in the dimension is undesirable. 
For this reason it is required to install various 
driving mechanisms including electric motors therefor, 
electric control circuits and sensors in efficient 
manner, utilizing the dead space in the lens barrel as 
far as possible. Fig. 11 is a cross-sectional view of a 
conventional camera provided with vibration detecting 
means. The lens of said camera is composed for example of 
optical systems L1, L2, L3; a focusing unit, an 
ultrasonic motor (USM) unit; an antivibration unit and 
a sensor unit. The focusing unit includes a fixed tube 1, a cam 
ring 2 provided on the external periphery of said fixed 
tube 1, a lens barrel 3 provided on the internal 
periphery of said fixed tube 1 and adapted to support 
the optical system L2, and a pin 4 fixed on the lens 
barrel 3 and adapted to engage with the cam ring 2, 
whereby the rotation of the cam ring 2 moves the 
optical system L2 in the axial direction through the 
pin 4 and the lens barrel 3 thereby effecting the  
 
focusing operation. The USM unit includes a stator 6 for generating a 
travelling vibration on the surface of an elastic 
member by the oscillation with a piezoelectric member, 
and a rotor 7 to be rotated by pressure contact with 
said stator 6. Said rotor 7
