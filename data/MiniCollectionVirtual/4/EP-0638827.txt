<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a structure for reinforcing an 
optical fiber (1), especially a bare fiber portion (1a) of the 

optical fiber (1) comprising a semi-cylindrical reinforcing 
member (10). The optical fiber (1) is placed in a groove (12) 

of the reinforcing member (10) so that the bare fiber portion 
(1a) of the optical fiber (1) is placed in a central portion of 

the groove (12) in a longitudinal direction. Further, the 
reinforcing structure comprises a heat-shrinkable tubing (14) 

adhered and fixed on a periphery of the reinforcing member (10) 
so as to cover the central portion of the groove (12). A part 

of the optical fiber (1) which is at the outside of the heat-shrinkable 
tubing (14) is fixed at the reinforcing member (10) 

by the adhesive (16). Further, the adhesive (16) seals ends of 
a hollow portion (18) defined by the reinforcing member (10) 

and the heat-shrinkable tubing (14). Therefore, the bare fiber 
portion (1a) of the optical fiber (1) in the hermetically 

sealed hollow portion (18) is protected from the external 
factors such as moisture, shocks or others.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
reinforcing an optical fiber, especially a bare fiber 
portion of the optical fiber, and an optical fiber 
reinforcing structure. In a general method of coupling optical fibers, 
first, the coating at the coupling ends of two optical 
fibers are removed to expose bare fibers. Next, the end 
faces of the bare fibers are butted against each other, 
and then heated by means of laser light, electric 
discharge, etc. to fuse the bare fiber ends together. A fusion drawing method of coupling optical fibers 
is well known. In the fusion drawing method, first a part 
of the coating of a plurality of optical fibers is removed 
to expose the bare optical fibers. Next, the exposed 
optical fibers are bundled through heating fusion in 
which they are twisted or arranged in parallel. 
Subsequently, the bundled portion is heated and drawn. 
Drawing is terminated when a characteristic such as a 
coupling ratio reaches a predetermined value, thereby 
forming a coupling portion.  In recent years, an optical waveguide which is flat 
and formed on a waveguide substrate has made a great 
advance, and a method of coupling an optical waveguide 
with optical fibers has been studied and improved. In the 
case of coupling the optical waveguide and the optical 
fiber, a part of the coating of the optical fiber is also 
removed to expose a bare fiber. As described above, in the fused and coupled optical 
fibers, or an optical fiber coupler having a fused and 
drawn portion, since the fused and coupled portion or the 
fused and drawn portion is a bare fiber, this portion is 
needed to be protected from external factors such as a 
shock, vibration, or others. A conventional reinforcing structure for a bare 
fiber portion of an optical fiber coupler is disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. SHO 63-271208 
(271208/1988). In this Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. SHO 
63-271208, a method in which only a drawn portion (small-diameter 
molten portion) of the optical fiber coupler is 
suspended and non-drawn portions (large-diameter molten 
portions) on both sides of the small-diameter molten 
portion are fixed to a case or a jig is disclosed. Further, a multi-fiber coupler reinforcing 
structure is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 
SHO 63-254406 (254406/1988). In this reinforcing 
structure, a pair of comb teeth-shaped fixing portions  
 
having a plurality of grooves are arranged on a 
substrate. The fixing portions are faced each other in a 
longitudinal direction of the
