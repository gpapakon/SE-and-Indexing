<ABSTRACT>
A drying apparatus (1) for a paper web (6) which passes through a rotary printing machine is arranged directly behind a printing unit of the printing machine and comprises a housing (2) which is passed through by the paper web as well as a blower arrangement and nozzle tubes (4) which extend transversely to the direction of movement of the paper web essentially over the entire width thereof and through which air taken in from the housing is blown onto the paper web by the blower arrangement. In order to considerably reduce the energy expenditure required for operating such a drying apparatus in relation to the drying capacity achieved, the nozzle tubes are arranged only on the freshly printed side of the paper web, and a guiding surface (9, 10) is provided on the side of the paper web opposite the nozzle tubes, on which guiding surface the paper web is supported without contact by means of an air cushion which is built up in an air gap (11) formed between the paper web and the guiding surface.

A drying apparatus for a web of paper which passes through a 
rotary printing machine, in particular a rotary intaglio printing 

machine, wherein the drying apparatus is arranged immediately 
downstream of a printing mechanism of the printing machine and 

includes a housing through which the web of paper passes, and a fan 
arrangement and nozzle pipes which extend transversely to the 

direction of movement of the web of paper substantially over the 
entire width thereof and through which air, that is sucked out of 

the housing by the fan arrangement, is blown onto the web of paper, 
characterised in that the nozzle pipes (4) are arranged only on the 

freshly printed side of the web of paper (6) and that provided on 
the side of the web of paper (6), that is opposite to the nozzle 

pipes (4), is a guide surface (9, 10) at which the web of paper (6) 
is supported in a contact-free manner by way of an air cushion. 
A drying apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the guide surface (9, 10) includes a flat surface region 

which extends substantially parallel to the web of paper (6) so 
that, with the web of paper, the surface region includes an air 

gap (11) of approximately uniform width, and that, at its end which 
is at the front in the direction of movement of the web of paper 

(6), the flat surface region (9) goes into a curved surface region 
(10) whose generatrices, transversely to the direction of movement, 

extend parallel to the web of paper (6) and which in the 
longitudinal direction is curved away from same in such a way that 

the air gap enclosed between it and the web of paper (6) increases 
in width towards the entry side of the web of paper (6). 
A drying apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2  
 

characterised in that the surface regions (9, 10) with which the 
guide surface is disposed opposite the web of paper (6) are together 

somewhat larger than the surface region with which the nozzle pipes 
(4) are disposed opposite the other side of the web of paper (6). 
A drying apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3 
characterized in that the guide surface (9, 10) is an outside 

surface of a hollow body (8) arranged beside the path of cement of 
the web of paper (6). 
A drying apparatus according to one of clams 1 to 4 
characterized in that there is a device for injecting air into the 

air gap enclosed between the guide surface (9, 10) and the web of 
paper (6). 
A drying apparatus according to claim 5 characterised in 
that the device for injecting air is arranged in the region of the 

curved surface portion (10). 
A drying apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that there is provided a device (18) for injecting 

steam into the air gap (11) between the guide surface (9, 10) and 
the web of paper (6). 
Apparatus according to claim 5 or claim 6 in conjunction 
with claim 7 characterised in that, in the direction of movement of 

the web of paper (6), the device for injecting air is arranged 
upstream of the device (18) for injecting steam. 
A drying apparatus according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the housing (2) is in the form of an almost  

 
closed unit with narrow entry and exit openings (14, 15) for the web 

of paper (6). 
A drying apparatus according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the drying apparatus is fed with heated air 

which is pre-charged with solvent, from a final drying section of 
the rotary printing machine. 
A drying apparatus according to one of claims 5 to 10 

characterised in that the heated air which is pre-charged with 
solvent from the final drying section is fed to the device for 

injecting air into the air gap enclosed between the guide surface 
(9, 10) and the web of paper.
