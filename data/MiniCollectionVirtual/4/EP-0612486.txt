<ABSTRACT>
An automatically locking slider (10) for slide 
fasteners is formed from a moldable plastics material 

and provided with an integral polygonal locking 
structure (26) including a spring portion (27), a 

locking prong portion (28) and an anchoring portion 
(29). The spring portion (27) is relatively short in 

length and has at one of its ends a bulged or ball-like 
projection (27a) extending outwardly beyond the region 

of the locking prong portion (28) for abutting 
engagement with the inner wall of a cap (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a slider for slide
fasteners and has particular reference to such a slider
which can lock itself automatically upon the slide
fastener.There are known a great many automatically
lockable sliders adapted to open and close slide
fasteners or zippers applied to various garment
articles. The majority of conventional automatically
locking sliders are fabricated from a metallic material
and provided with locking means comprising a locking
member and a resilient member typically in the form of a
leaf spring, the two members being separately
accommodated within a cap-like housing over a slider
body. Assembling such sliders is rather tedious, as the
resilient member is required to be carefully held in
abutting engagement with the inner wall of the housing
and accurately positioned relative to the locking member
to ensure proper operation of the latter. Advanced sliders of the automatic type are disclosed in
Japanese Utility Model Publications Nos. 46-4268 and 46-4269
in which the slider is provided with a leaf spring integrally
joined at one end to a locking member and folded back toward
the opposite end to bear against the upper inner wall of a
casing. Although this leaf spring is integrally formed with
the locking member, it is elongated such that its resilient
strength is reduced, leading to a malfunctioning locking
operation of the slider.A common problem with automatic locking sliders
incorporating metallic leaf springs is that they are costly
due to the use of relatively expensive resilient material.FR-A-2 174 848 discloses an automatically locking slider
for slide fasteners according to the preamble of the appending
claim 1. In this conventional locking slider, the locking
member is elongated and the reduced neck is connected with the
arcuate arm thereof by an intermediate straight portion. If
this conventional locking member is formed from a mouldable
plastic material it is difficult to retain the strength of the
locking prong of the locking member as well as the spring
force thereof, leading to reduced or insufficient strength
over the whole locking member and hence defective function of
the locking member.With the foregoing difficulties of the prior art in view,
the present invention seeks to provide an automatically
locking slide for slide fasteners which is made of a moldable
synthetic resin. The invention also seeks to provide an automatically
locking slider for slide fasteners incorporating structural
features such that a locking member can be supported stably
in position
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An automatically locking slider (10) for slide
fasteners which is formed from a moldable plastics material

and which comprises a slider body (11) having an upper
shield (12) and a lower shield (13) spaced apart in parallel

and interconnected at one of their ends by a connecting head
(14) to define therebetween a guide channel (15); a pull tab

(16) having a pintle (17) pivotally supported on said upper
shield (12); a locking member (26) for releasably locking

the slider (10) with respect to the fastener; and a cap (18)
secured to said upper shield (12) and encasing said locking

member (26), said locking member (26) comprising an integral
polygonal structure including a spring portion (27) having a

relatively short arcuate arm (27a) with a bulged end (27b),
a locking prong portion (28) having a locking prong (28a)

and a reduced neck (28c) merging with said arm (27a) and
engageable with said pintle (17) and an anchoring portion

(29) remote from said locking prong (28) for anchoring said
locking meber (26) relative to said slider body (11),
characterized in that
 said reduced neck (28c) also merges
with said anchoring portion (29), said locking prong portion

(28) and said anchoring portion (29) having an upturned
"U"-shape, said reduced neck (28c) being disposed in the

crest of said upturned "U". 
An automatically locking slider (10) according
to claim 1 characterized in that said bulged end (27b)

of said spring member (27) is in the form of a spherical
ball.
An automatically locking slider (10) according
to claim 1 characterized in that said bulged end (27b)

extends outwardly beyond said locking prong (28a). 
An automatically locking slider (10) according
to claim 1 characterized in that said reduced neck (28c)

is located intermediate between said locking prong (28a)
and said anchoring portion (29) for engagement with

said pintle (17).
