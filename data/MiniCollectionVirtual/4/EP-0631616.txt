Title: FATTY ACID MICROSPHERES CONTAININGENTEROCOCCUS FOR USE TO ENHANCE GROWTH AND IMPROVE CARCASS QUALITYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONGrowth enhancers in the form of antibiotics have been used extensively for poultry, namely chickens and turkey. Growth enhancers such as Stafac® and BMD ® (bacitracin methylene disalicylate) are known antibiotics and have been used at sub-therapeutic levels of for example, 10 grams per ton and 25 grams per ton as feed additives in order to promote desirable growth features in poultry. However, the use of antibiotics for these purposes has recently come under some criticism. One of the criticisms is the possibility that the poultry eventually develop tolerance to the antibiotics and eventually the antibiotic no longer works well for growth promotion. Other objections relate to health concerns from non- natural antibiotic additives and the adulterating effects they may have. Nevertheless, because of the advantages of antibiotic uses they are still commonly used in order to improve feed conversion, improve carcass composition, and enhance growth.It is known that certain bacteria are potentially beneficial when added to animal feeds. These bacteria are beneficial in that they supply a natural intestinal micro-flora. Some companies offer for sale direct-fed microbials which contain desirable bacteria. Direct-fed microbials, however, do have some difficulty in maintaining a stable product. Typically, the direct-fed microbial is used at a fairly low level, added to feed at perhaps a 0.1% level. However, unused direct-fed microbial 

containing feed or feed additive product is often stored by the farmers for long periods of time. This storage many times is under conditions where there is some moisture and high temperature. In many instances there is just enough moisture that the bacteria are activated or start to grow, but yet there is an in¬ sufficient amount of moisture to sustain them. As a result they die. Thus, the activity of the direct-fed microbial is stopped. In other instances, the addition of antibiotics to the direct fed microbial containing feed or feed additive adversely interacts with the bacteria, particularly if there are small amounts of moisture present and thus again bacteria are killed. Thus, there is a significant problem of long term storage stability for direct-fed microbials.In another environment, where the direct-fed microbial is added to, for example chicken feed, it is common to pelletize the material with the direct-fed microbial added before

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. A method of growth promotion animals comprising: adding to a normal animal feed ration a small .but growth promotion effective amount of direct-fed microbial consisting essentially of viable, stable, dried fatty acid microspheres of Enterococcus faecium 301, ATCC No. , and viable, stable, dried fatty acid microspheres of Enterococcus faecium 202,
ATCC No. .
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the fatty acid spheres are formed using a rotary disc.
3. The method of claim 2 wherein the direct-fed microbial is from about 30% to about 70% of one of said fatty acid microspheres with balance being the other.
4. The method of claim 3 wherein the fatty acid is a C..~ to C~ . free fatty acid.
5. The method of claim 4 wherein the fatty acid is stearic acid.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein each of said streptococci are present in about equal amounts.
7. The method of claim 1 wherein the amount of direct-fed microbial added to the feed ration is from about 0.5 pounds to about 2.0 lbs./ton of feed. 


 8. The method of claim 7 wherein the amount of direct-fed microbial is from about 0.8 lbs. to about 1.2 lbs./ton of feed.
9.
The method of claim 7 wherein the organism count
5 of the direct-fed microbial is from about 1 x 10
CFU/gm to about 2 x 10
8
 CFU/gm.
10.
The method of claim 9 wherein the organism count
5 of the direct-fed microbial is about 1 x 10 CFU/gm.
11.
The process of claim 1 wherein the animal is a chicken.
12.
The process of claim 1 wherein the animal is swine.
13.
A direct-fed microbial composition for growth enhancement of animals swine consisting essentially of viable, stable, dried fatty acid microspheres of
Enterococcus faecium 301, and viable, stable, dried fatty acid microspheres of Enterococcus faecium 202.
14.
A direct-fed microbial of claim 13 which has from about 30% to about 20% of one of said streptococci with the balance being the other.
15.
The direct-fed microbial of claim 14 wherein the free fatty acid is a C- ~ to C
2
- free fatty acid.
16.
The direct-fed microbial of claim 15 wherein the free fatty acid stearic acid. 


 17. The direct-fed microbial of claim 16 wherein the streptococci organisms are present in about equal amounts.
18. The composition of claim 13 wherein the animal is a chicken.
19. The composition of claim 13 wherein the animal is a swine.
