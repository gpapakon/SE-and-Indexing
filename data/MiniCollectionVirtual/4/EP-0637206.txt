<ABSTRACT>
An edible article, e.g. an ice lolly (1) having a temperature below -3  DEG C, at least part (3) of which is transparent and in a non-crystalline state. In preferred embodiments that part (3) is either in a non-solidified state at temperatures down to at least -5 DEG C or in a glassy state at temperatures between -5  DEG C and -20 DEG C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an edible article having a 
temperature below -3°C, in particular below -10°C and in 
general preferably below -15°C, at least part of which is 
transparent. The edible articles of the invention are 
frozen confections comprising a transparent non-crystalline 
part. It is known that tap water and aqueous solutions liberate 
dissolved gas on freezing, the liberated gas being one 
cause of opacity of ice cubes and frozen confections. 
Water ices and similar frozen novelties are mainly opaque 
due to differences in the refractive index of ice crystals 
and of the matrix of frozen sugar solution. The Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol.6, no.261 (C-141), 21 December 1982 
disclose the preparation of frozen food having a transparent ice shell. There is a continuing need for novel products in the area 
of frozen confections and an object of the invention is to 
provide an edible article such as an ice lolly, which is 
transparent at the temperatures as defined before. The invention provides thereto an edible article having a 
temperature below -3°C, at least part of which is 
transparent, wherein the bulk of the transparent part is in 
a non-crystalline state and the article is hand held with the aid 
of a stick positioned within the article. The storage and consumption 
temperatures generally are both below -10°C and often 
mostly below -15°C. In practice several options are available for maintaining 
the non-crystalline state, one being arranging that the 
transparent part is in a glassy state at temperatures above 
-20°C and preferably above -10°C, being the usual lower 
limit for the consumption temperature and another arranging 
that the bulk of the transparent part is in a non-solidified 
state at temperatures down to -5°C or below, and 
preferably below the usual storage temperatures. The 
former option can be realised in practice by having an  
 
adequate concentration of sufficiently low molecular weight 
solutes contained in that transparent part, the latter 
option by having sufficient solutes contained in that 
transparent part of depress the freezing point thereof to 
below the required temperature. Particularly in case of using freezing point depressants 
the perceived sweetness of the non-frozen transparent part 
may be reduced if it comprises a gelling agent in an amount 
sufficient to effect gelation at temperatures below -15°C 
and preferably below the usual storage temperatures, 
generally about -20°C. A preferred gelling agent for this 
purpose is gelatin and in
