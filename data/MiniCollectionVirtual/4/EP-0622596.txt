<ABSTRACT>
In a method of sintering cement clinker, raw material for cement 
is granulated in a spouted type fluidized bed granulating 

furnace (2) and the granules are sintered in a fluidized 
bed sintering furnace (3). The granules to be injected into 

said sintering furnace (3) are controlled to have a predetermined 
granule size range so that the operation of the sintering 

apparatus is stabilized and high-quality cement clinker 
is obtained. The granules discharged from the granulating 

furnace (2) are classified by blowing classifying gas into the 
granulating furnace (2) at a predetermined flow velocity, small 

size granules are returned to the granulating furnace (2), and 
granules having sizes larger than a predetermined size are 

injected into the sintering furnace (3) to be sintered.

<DESCRIPTION>
A first aspect of the present invention relates 
to a method of sintering cement clinker of a type using a 
spouted-type fluidized bed granulating furnace and a 
fluidized bed sintering furnace and a sintering apparatus 
for use to embody the sintering method. A second aspect of the present invention 
relates to an apparatus for discharging granules from a 
fluidized bed for cement clinker, such as a spouted-type 
fluidized bed granulating furnace or a fluidized bed 
sintering furnace. A third aspect of the present invention relates 
to a cement clinker sintering apparatus having an 
improved discharge chute for injecting, into a sintering 
furnace, substances granulated in a granulating furnace 
of a spouted bed type or a spouted-type fluidized bed 
type or a fluidized bed type. A fourth aspect of the present invention 
relates to an apparatus for sintering cement clinker 
comprising an improved discharge chute of a granulating 
furnace of a spouted bed type or a spouted-type fluidized 
bed type or a fluidized bed type. Cement clinker is manufactured in such a manner 
that raw material powder obtained by blending and  
 
grinding limestone or quartz sand is first granulated and 
then it is sintered and cooled. In recent years, the 
cement clinker has been usually manufactured by using a 
sintering apparatus comprising a spouted-type fluidized 
bed granulating furnace and a fluidized bed sintering 
furnace. The reason for this is that the cement 
sintering apparatus using the fluidized bed furnace 
exhibits excellent heat efficiency and advantages in 
terms of reducing required installation space, realizing 
a satisfactory fuel consumption and preventing harmful 
gases (NOX and CO2 and so forth) as compared with a 
conventional rotary kiln type sintering apparatus. 
Moreover, the foregoing furnace is considered suitable to 
manufacture many types of products in a small quantity. 
In addition, an apparatus of the foregoing type 
comprising the two furnaces as the essential portion 
thereof enables the granulating process and the sintering 
process to be individually controlled, causing an 
advantage to be obtained in that cement clinker 
exhibiting excellent quality can be manufactured. In the spouted-type fluidized bed granulating 
furnace, raw material powder, which has been previously 
heated and injected to the same, is fluidized by hot gas 
so that a portion of the fluidized raw material powder 
present adjacent to the surface is, with heat, melted and 
allowed to adhere mutually as to be allowed to
