<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to piperazine derivatives, to
processes for their preparation, to their use and to
pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The novel
compounds act on the central nervous system by binding
to 5-HT receptors (as more fully explained below) and
hence can be used as medicaments for treating humans
and other mammals.GB 2230781-A and GB 2230780-A disclose related
piperazine derivatives which exhibit 5-HT1A receptor
affinity.The novel compounds of the invention are those of the
general formula

and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts
thereof.In formula (I)
A is an alkylene chain of 1 or 2 carbon atoms
optionally substituted by one or more lower alkyl
groups,Z is a bicyclic oxygen-containing radical of the
formula
 
wherein the heterocyclic ring containing the oxygen
atom contains a total of 5 to 7 ring members, said
heterocyclic ring being saturated or unsaturated, being
optionally substituted (eg by one or more substituents
R5 where R5 has the meaning given for R4 below) and
optionally containing one or more hetero ring members
(eg -O-, -NR2- where R2 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, -S-
or -SO2-) in addition to the oxygen atom illustrated,R represents hydrogen or one or two same or different
lower alkyl groups
R1is an aryl radical or an aryl(lower)alkyl radicalR2is hydrogen or lower alkylR3is hydrogen, an alkyl group of 1 to 10 carbon atoms,
cycloalkyl of 3 to 12 carbon atoms,
cycloalkyl(lower)alkyl, aryl or aryl(lower)alkyl
orR2 and R3together with the nitrogen atom to which
they are both attached represent a saturated
heterocyclic ring which may contain a further hetero
atom (eg an azetidino, pyrrolidino, piperidino,
hexahydroazepino, heptamethyleneimine, morpholino or
piperazino ring which may be optionally substituted
by lower alkyl, aryl or aryl(lower)alkyl)R4represents hydrogen or one or more same or different
substituents selected from lower alkyl, halogen,
halo(lower)alkyl (eg trifluoromethyl), nitro,
nitrile, oxo, hydroxy, (lower)alkoxy, hydroxy(lower)alkyl,
(lower)alkoxy(lower alkyl), lower
alkanoyloxy(lower alkyl), (lower)alkylcarbonyl, 
(lower)alkylcarbonyl-(lower)alkyl, carbamoyl
amino, acylamino (eg loweralkanoylamino),
(lower)alkylamino or di(lower)alkylamino.The term "lower" as used herein means that the radical
referred to contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Preferably
such radicals contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of
alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl,
butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl and
isopentyl. When R3 is an alkyl
