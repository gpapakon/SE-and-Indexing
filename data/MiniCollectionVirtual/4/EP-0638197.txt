<ABSTRACT>
A data cartridge (10) of the type in which magnetic recording tape (21) is reversibly driven from one spool (18) to another (20) by an endless elastic drive belt (40) contacting the periphery of the tape spools, a drive roller (36), and two located rollers (42, 44) at opposite corners of the cartridge. Tape tension and drive force are controlled by predetermined drag resulting from magnetic brakes built into the corner rollers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a belt driven data cartridge and, in 
particular, to belt guide rollers used therein. The belt driven data tape cartridge of Von Behren, U.S. Patent No. 
3,692,255, on which the preamble of appended claim 1 in based has become a standard interface with computers where streaming and 
other off-line data back-up operations require rapid acceleration and deceleration 
of the tape. In these tape cartridges, a belt is driven by a drive roller along a belt 
path which includes a portion of the peripheries of the drive roller, a supply spool, 
a take-up spool, and two corner guide rollers positioned adjacent the tape spools, 
thereby reversibly driving the tape from spool to spool. A tape path extends 
between the spools and along one edge of the cartridge at which access to the tape 
and drive roller is provided. Belt driven tape cartridges must meet minimum tape tension specifications 
while simultaneously operating within maximum allowable drive force 
specifications. The tape tension must not fall below a certain level as the tape 
passes from spool to spool or contact between a read/write head and the tape will 
be insufficient to allow successful data transfer. The minimum tape tension should 
thus be as high as possible but, conversely, the maximum drive force, i.e., the 
force applied to rotate the cartridge drive roller, should be as low as possible so 
as to allow the use of an inexpensive, low-power motor in the associated drive. 
As these parameters are dependent on friction within the cartridge, all friction 
sources must be controlled. Furthermore, in the case of the corner rollers, it is 
desirable to maintain some non-zero level of friction between the rollers and their 
pivot pins. It is known that drag in the corner roller produces a differential in belt 
tension which in turn produces the required tension in the tape. The latter tension  
 
is produced because tension in the portion of the belt that presses on the take-up 
spool, being stretched by the drive roller, causes the belt to move slightly faster 
and that spool to similarly rotate slightly faster than the nominal belt speed. 
Conversely, as the belt is basically pushed by the drive roller and hence 
compresses as it contacts the supply spool, the belt there moves slightly slower and 
thus causes that spool to rotate slightly slower. The most common method of 
producing such belt drag is to apply friction to the belt or to the corner rollers 
about which the belt extends. In the vast majority of such

A belt driven data cartridge (10) of the type in 
which a magnetic recording tape (21) wound on a pair of 

tape spools (18,20), each mounted on a shaft (14, 16) 
affixed to a base (12), is reversibly driven from one said 

spool to the other by a thin, continuous flexible belt 
(40) in contact with the periphery of each said spool, and 

tension maintaining the belt in driving contact with the 
respective spools is provided by stretching the belt 

around at least a portion of the periphery of a drive 
puck, the respective spools, and at least one roller 

(42,44), 

wherein said roller includes an outer periphery (52) 
structured to contact said drive belt and an inner periphery 

(54) structured to rotate on a shaft (48) fixed to 
said base, 
characterized in that
said roller further includes in combination with said 
base, a magnetic brake assembly for controllably 
resisting 
rotation of said roller, thereby imparting controlled 

tension on said belt. 
A cartridge according to claim 1, wherein said at least one roller 
comprises a body having an inner sleeve (53) defining a bore adapted to receive 

a said shaft extending from the base to enable rotation of the roller thereabout, said 
body further having interior walls (54) defining a recess, and wherein said brake 

assembly comprises a permanent magnet assembly mounted coaxially with said 
bore within said recess, a magnetizable member (60) which is part of the base and 

extends radially around coaxially with said shaft, and means for separating a top 
surface of said magnetizable member from said permanent magnet assembly 

(56,58) such that rotation of the roller and magnet assembly mounted therein with 
respect to the magnetizable member imparts a predetermined amount of drag 

resisting said rotation. 
A cartridge according to claim 2, wherein said magnetizable 
member comprises a remanently magnetizable member, which in combination with 

said permanent magnet assembly, provides a hysteresis brake. 
A cartridge according to claim 2, wherein said separating means 
comprises a non-magnetic washer (78) coaxially affixed to the exposed face of the 

permanent magnet assembly and adapted to rotate against the face of the 
magnetizable member (84), magnetic attraction forces between the magnet 

assembly and magnetizable member thereby pressing the non-magnetic washer into  
 

frictional contact with the magnetizable member so as to provide a thrust bearing 
which also functions to provide a predetermined drag, depending on the magnetic 

attraction forces and frictional coupling at the rotating surfaces. 
A 
cartridge according to claim 1, wherein said brake assembly comprises a ring-shaped 

permanent magnet (56) coaxially positioned within said roller and a 
magnetizable member (60) affixed to said base coaxial with said shaft and spaced 

a predetermined distance from said first face, and wherein the magnet has a 
plurality of axially extending magnetic dipoles so as to present at a first face 

extending generally perpendicularly from the axis a plurality of alternating polarity 
magnetic poles (62, 64, 66). 
A cartridge according to claim 5, further comprising a magnetic 
shunt (58) coaxial with and adjacent to the opposing face of said magnet. 
A cartridge according to claim 5, wherein said magnet includes a 
plurality of discrete magnetic segments of alternating polarity. 
A cartridge according to claim 5, wherein said magnet comprises 
a homogeneous bonded magnet magnetized to have at least two, alternate polarity, 

axially extending, magnetic dipoles. 
A cartridge according to claim 5, wherein said ring-shaped 
permanent magnet is thicker at its outer periphery than at its inner periphery. 
A cartridge according to claim 9, wherein the inner periphery of 
said magnet is about 3/5 as thick as the outer periphery of said magnet.
