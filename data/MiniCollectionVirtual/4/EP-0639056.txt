<ABSTRACT>
A starch-thickened foodstuff having improved freeze-thaw stability and good texture comprising a native starch component and an amylopectin component. The amylopectin component is manufactured by subjecting the amylopectin component's source to shear forces. Preferred source of the amylopectin component is a waxy starch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to starch-thickened food-stuffs 
with improved freeze-reheat stability and having a 
smooth texture with low or negligible sliminess comprising 
a starch component and an amylopectin component, and a 
process for preparation thereof. Starches are widely used in food applications as thickeners 
or bodying agents of starch-thickened foods. By "starch-thickened 
foods" are understood, throughout this 
specification and the attached claims, any fluid, pasty or 
semi-solid food product in which a, preferably native, 
starch-based thickening agent is used to impart a degree of 
thickening. Examples of such foods include sauces, soups, 
gravies, creams, and the like. Starch consists of granules which have ordered structures 
which are semi-crystalline and birefringent. Chemically, 
starches mainly consist of two types of polysaccharides, 
amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is an essentially linear 
1-4-linked alpha-D-glucose and amylopectin is a highly 
branched macromolecule consisting of short chains of 
1-4-linked alpha-D-glucose with 1-6-linked branches. When starch granules are heated in water at a specific 
temperature (the gelatinization temperature, usually about 
55°C to 70°C), the granules swell irreversibly and the 
amylose is preferentially solubilized. During this 
gelatinization, the granule birefringence and crystallinity 
disappear and a viscous solubilized paste is formed. The 
swollen starch granules, upon cooling to room temperature, 
show a strong tendency to associate with each another  
 
through hydrogen-bonding between hydroxyl groups. This 
phenomenon is called retrogradation. In dilute starch 
solutions the amylose slowly aligns itself in parallel 
fashion to give insoluble bundles, which render the 
solution opaque and may cause precipitates. In more 
concentrated solutions (about 5% by weight and higher) the 
amylose molecules associate in random fashion and give a 
reticulated network of a gel. If the starch gel is frozen, the freezing causes the 
separation of discrete ice crystals and this water does not 
reconstitute uniformly when the system is thawed. As a 
consequence, the starch paste loses its water-retention 
capacity and a watery phase is separated by syneresis. If an appreciable level of native starch (containing 
amylose) is used in the food product, the product may lose 
its smooth creamy consistency upon freezing and become 
lumpy or curdled in texture and reheating will usually not 
restore the original appearance of the product. The
