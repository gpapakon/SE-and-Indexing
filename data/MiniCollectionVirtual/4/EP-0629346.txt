<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stabilized 
solid pesticidal composition containing acephate. Acephate (O,S-dimethyl acetylphosphoramidothioate) 
is an insecticidally active compound as 
described in the page 1 of The Pesticide Manual 8th 
edition (published from the British Crop Protection 
Council in 1987). Since this compound is effective to 
control various pests, it is now used as an active 
ingredient for agricultural pesticides. However, acephate pesticidal compositions 
may lack stability, so that acephate in the 
compositions decomposes violently, depending upon 
storage conditions. As a result, there are cases where 
the pesticidal activity of acephate cannot be used 
effectively. Therefore, there has been a demand for the 
development or stabilized pesticidal compositions 
containing acephate. The present invention is based on the 
discovery that solid pesticidal compositions containing 
acephate may be stabilized by adding thereto 
an effective amount of at least one of boron oxide, 
metaboric acid, aluminum oxide and the calcined 
product of synthetic silicon dioxide. The present 
invention provides a stabilized solid pesticidal 
composition containing acephate and a method  
 
for stabilizing the composition. The amount of at least one boron oxide, 
metaboric acid and aluminum oxide effective to stabilize 
acephate is generally 0.01 to 0.5 part by weight to 1 
part by weight of acephate. Of course, a higher amount 
thereof may be used. When the calcined product of synthetic silicon 
dioxide is used as the stabilizer, the amount of the 
stabilizer added is generally 0.05 part by weight or 
more to 1 part by weight of acephate. The calcined product of synthetic silicon 
dioxide used in the present invention is usually 
produced by adding a mineral acid such as hydrochloric 
acid and sulfuric acid to an aqueous sodium silicate 
solution to precipitate synthetic silicon dioxide 
and then calcining this precipitate usually at 
600째C to 900째C, preferably 700째C to 
800 째C. Commercially available products such as Carplex 
CS-7 (produced by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.), Carplex CS-5 
(produced by Shionogi & Co., Ltd.) and Finesil P-8 
(produced by Tokuyama Soda Co., Ltd.) may be used as 
they are. The solid pesticidal composition stabilized 
by the present invention usually contains (a) acephate, 
(b) at least one boron oxide metaboric acid, aluminum 
oxide and the calcined product of synthetic silicon 
dioxide and (c) a solid carrier for formulation. When 
the calcined product of synthetic silicon
