<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing double-stranded RNA, in which
process the simultaneous transcription is carried out of the

two complementary strands of a DNA sequence which are present
in the same reaction mixture and the immediate hybridization is

carried out of the two transcripts obtained.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the two
strands of DNA intended to be transcribed are under the control

of a promoter sequence recognized by the same RNA polymerase.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the two
strands of DNA intended to be transcribed are under the control

of promoter sequences recognized by two different RNA
polymerases.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the two DNA strands intended to be transcribed belong

to two different duplexes.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the two strands of DNA intended to be transcribed are

combined in the same duplex.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein the strands of DNA intended to be transcribed are

attached to a solid support.
The process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6,
which comprises, in addition, a step for the detection and/or

assay of the double-stranded RNA obtained.
A method for the detection and/or assay of a target
DNA sequence in a biological sample, which method comprises a

step during which the simultaneous transcription of all or part
of the two complementary strands of the said target sequence is

carried out by a process as claimed in any one of claims 1
to 7.
The method as claimed in claim 8, which comprises,
prior to the transcription step, at least one step during which

the amplification of the target sequence is carried out. 
The method as claimed in either of claims 8 or 9,
wherein at least one segment of the product of transcription of

the target sequence to be detected is in the form of single-stranded
RNA, and wherein the said transcription product is

attached onto a solid support via a single-stranded segment.
The method as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 10,
wherein several different target sequences are transcribed and

detected simultaneously in the same sample.
