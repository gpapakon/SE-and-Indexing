<ABSTRACT>
This invention simplifies a process of attaching a 
torsion coil spring 6 to an arm 22 of a lever 21. Each arm 

22 of the lever 21 is provided on its inner face with a ring 
slot 25 formed around a bearing hole 23 for accommodating a 

ring portion 6a of the torsion coil spring 6 and a pair of 
holding slots 26 and 27 communicated with the ring slot 25 

for accommodating end portions 6b and 6c. A raised guide 
29 is formed on the inner face of the arm 22 near an outer 

edge of the holding slot 27. The raised guide 29 has a ramp 
face 30 which continuously increases in height approaching 

the holding slot 27 and a precipice 33 contiguous to the 
outer edge of the slot 27. The arm 22 of the lever 21 may 

be provided on its inner face with a circular arc tool slot 
32 having a certain depth and extending from an end face of 

the arm 22 across a cam groove to the holding slot 27.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lever type connector assembly which 
interconnects and separates connectors by utilizing a cam action and more 
particularly to a lever type connector assembly in which a torsion coil 
spring for rockably biasing a lever to a given initial position is 
temporarily attached to one of the connectors. A lever type connector assembly has an advantage of 
interconnecting and separating connectors by a small force and 
particularly can be applied to multipole connectors. For convenience of explanation, a conventional lever type 
connector assembly will be explained below by referring to drawings. Figure 7 is an exploded perspective view of a conventional lever 
type connector assembly. Figure 8 is a perspective view of a lever shown 
in Figure 7, illustrating a torsion coil spring mounted on a side plate of 
the lever. Figure 9 is a perspective view of a female connector housing shown 
in Figure 7. Figure 10 is a fragmentary cross sectional view of the 
housing and lever shown in Figure 7, illustrating a position of which an 
end of the torsion coil spring engages with the housing. Figure 11 is a 
perspective view of a conventional torsion coil spring. Figure 12 is a 
fragmentary enlarged perspective view of the lever shown in Figure 8. 
Figure 13 is a cross sectional view of the lever shown in Figure 8, 
illustrating a process of attaching the torsion coil spring to the lever. 
Figure 14 is a longitudinal sectional view of the lever, illustrating a  
 
process of attaching an end of the torsion coil spring into a holding slot in 
the lever. An example of a conventional connector housing assembly, as 
shown in Figure 7, includes one (female) connector housing 1, a lever 3 
mounted rotatably on a pair of support axles 4 on the housing 1 and 
having cam grooves 3a, and the other (male) connector housing 2 having a 
pair of cam followers 5. The pair of connector housings 1 and 2 are 
coupled to and detached from each other when the lever 3 is turned about 
the axles 4 to move the cam followers 5. In the above lever type connector assembly, in order to bias the 
lever 3 to a given rotary direction, a torsion coil spring 6 shown in Figure 
14 is coupled to the lever 3 and female connector housing 1, as shown in 
Figures 8 to 10. At this time, a ring portion 6a of the spring 6 
(Figure 11) is disposed around a bearing hole 3b and on an inner face of a 
side plate or arm 22a of the lever (see Figure 8), an end portion 6b of the 
spring 6 engages with the inner face of the arm 22a (see
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A lever type connector assembly comprises: 

a pair of first and second connector housings (11,12); 
a lever (21) having a pair of arms (22) on opposite ends and 
mounted rotatably on said first connector housing, said arm being 

provided on its inner face with a cam groove (24) which engages with a 
cam follower (13) on said second connector housing, said first and second 

connector housings being connected with and detached from each other 
when said lever is turned to move said cam follower; 
torsion coil springs (6) having a central ring portion (6a) and a pair 
of first (6b) and second (6c) end portions extending from said ring 

portion, each torsion coil spring being coupled to said first connector 
housing and said arm of said lever to bias said lever toward a given rotary 

direction, said arm of said lever being provided on its inner face with a 
central ring slot (25) adapted to accommodate said ring portion of said 

central ring portion and a pair of first and second holding slots (26, 27) 
communicated with said central ring slot and adapted to accommodate said 

first and second end portions (6b, 6c) of said spring with said spring 
being biased; 
 
   characterised in that said assembly is provided with assuring means 

comprising a raised guide (29) which is formed near an outer edge of said 
second holding slot (27) said raised guide comprising a ramp face (30) 

which continuously increases in height approaching said second holding 
slot and a precipice (33) contiguous to said outer edge of said holding slot 

and an aperture (28) is formed in the arm of the lever, adapted so that a 
tool pin can be inserted through the aperture to transfer the second end 

portion (6c) of the spring (6) from the lever (21) to said first connector 
housing.
