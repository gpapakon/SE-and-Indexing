<ABSTRACT>
The auger device has an outer tube (10) and an inner tube (11) provided with an auger (30). The auger (30) delivers the cuttings under compaction from the bottom of the borehole into the following rectilinear section (32), in which the cuttings are displaced. To avoid the development of suction at the bottom of the borehole, the shank (30a) of the auger (30) is provided with a bore (36) which contains a non-return valve (38). The non-return valve (38) is transmissive in the direction of the bottom of the borehole. Pumping movements can be carried out with the auger in order to pump air through the inner tube into the borehole. The air is then used to assist the delivery of the cuttings.

<CLAIMS>
An auger drilling device comprising an outer
casing pipe (10) to be driven by a first rotating

and advance device (14) and an inner casing
pipe (11) to be driven by a second rotating and

advance device (15) and having a helical auger
(30) mounted on its front end,
characterized in

that the shank (30a) of the auger is provided
with a bore (36) connected to the channel of the

inner casing pipe (11), and that the bore (36)
or the channel of the inner casing pipe has arranged

therein a back-check valve (38) which
opens in the direction towards the front end.
The auger drilling device according to claim 1,
characterized in that the auger (30) comprises

three windings at the most.
The auger drilling device according to claim 1
or 2, characterized in that, at a distance behind

the auger (30), at least one supporting
auger (33) is arranged within the inner casing

pipe (11).
The auger drilling device according to any one
of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the

second rotating and advance device (15) is controlled 
to cause pumping movements of the inner

casing pipe (11) along with the auger (30).
The auger drilling device according to any one
of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the rotating

and advance devices (14,15) are displaceable
along a carriage (13) and that the

second rotating and advance device (15) can be
moved substantially over the complete length of

the carriage.
The auger drilling device according to any one
of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a percussion

drive (25) is provided for exerting
percussive movements onto the rear end of the

inner casing pipe (11).
The auger drilling device according to any one
of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the inner

casing pipe is provided as a telescopic bar
comprising a plurality of telescope pipes.
