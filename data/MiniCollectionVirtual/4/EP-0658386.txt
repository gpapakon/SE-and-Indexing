<ABSTRACT>
Foundry apparatus for automatic casting with 
pressurized ladle comprising a motorized means (15) which 

cooperates with a casting line with dies (10) and/or 
flaskless dies to be cast that are movable along first 

translatory guides (12); the motorized means (15) are 
movable along second guides (13) which are parallel and 

close to the first guides (12); the motorized means (15) 
furthermore support a pressurized ladle (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foundry apparatus
for automatic casting with pressurized ladle.Pressurized ladles are currently used in foundries;
one of them is the subject of Italian patent no. 1,225,409
in the name of the same Applicant.This pressurized ladle includes a steel plate
container which is internally lined with refractory
material and has a hermetic upper lid provided with means
for discharging and introducing pressurized gas.Two siphons, one for loading and one for casting, are
connected below the container and extend upwards.The first siphon has, in an upward region, a funnel-shaped
loading mouth; the second siphon is instead provided
with a basin with a casting hole in an upward region.The ladle includes optical devices for controlling the
level in the runner and a plug for closing the casting
hole.The molten metal is loaded by means of a secondary
ladle which is appropriately removed from a melting
furnace.When the container has been filled, pressurized gas is
injected therein; this reduces the internal level and
raises the levels in the siphons and therefore in the
runner.The level control device, combined with the plug for
opening and closing the casting hole, allows the material
to be cast into a die arranged below.Casting currently occurs by keeping the ladle fixed 
and by providing casting dies which are arranged in series
and movable along a rail.When one die has been filled, the assembly is
conveniently moved by one step so as to position the next
die for casting.This fixed-ladle system is in any case a poorly
flexible system from an operational point of view, since
only the dies to be cast are movable, and production times
are negatively affected if the movement is blocked for any
reason.The time for which the metal to be cast remains in the
ladle furthermore increases, and the metal consequently
cools to unacceptable limits.This problem is not solved by a foundry apparatus for
automatic casting such as that disclosed in DE-B-2429529.
In such apparatus comprising a motorized means supporting a
ladle, dies to be cast are movable along first translatory
guides and the motorized means are movable along second
guides, the second guides forming a circular path for the
ladle. The first and second guides are close and parallel
over only a short curved segment and therefore production
would be adversely affected if the movement of the dies
were to be blocked for any reason.A principal aim of the present invention is therefore
to provide a foundry apparatus for automatic casting
