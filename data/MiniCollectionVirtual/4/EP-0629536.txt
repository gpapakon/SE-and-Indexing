<ABSTRACT>
Displacement device for sliding walls of freight cars, which can be used under the conditions of use of high-speed bogies in freight car traffic in the highly restricted installation space of the longitudinal carrier, a sliding element (1) being mounted in a rolling fashion on the lower chord of the longitudinal carrier (12), the sliding element (1) being actuated with a lever device (7) and consisting of a rail component (13) on which the running roller (6) of the sliding wall rests and this rail component (13) closing the gap of the running rail (8) which is attached to the wagon and passes through and the roller thus being able to roll onto the running rail (8) when the wall is opened, and a movable rail (5) which is connected downstream closing the gap in the running rail (8) which passes through when the sliding element (1) moves into the cavity of the longitudinal carrier (12), and the sliding element (1) with supporting component and movable rail (5) with associated pull rod forming one constructional unit. This invention is particularly suitable for use in high speed services by virtue of its compact arrangement in the cavity of the longitudinal carrier (12) and by virtue of the movable rail (5) which is provided and which closes the interrupted outline of the outer running rail (8) in the moved-in state of the displacement device.

<CLAIMS>
Extension device for sliding panels of goods 
wagons, having a running rail interrupted in the shifting 

area, the sliding panel being provided with a supporting 
foot and a running roller which are supported on bearing 

elements, whereby a displacement into the closing plane 
is made possible, characterized in that a running roller 

(6) of a roller foot (11) of the sliding panel rests on 
a rail part (13), formed like the running rail, of a 

sliding body (1), which is arranged in a horizontally 
displaceable manner via roller-bearing rollers (2) on the 

bottom leg of a longitudinal member (12) and is connected 
via pins (9) and levers (7) to the actuating device of an 

adjusting lever (14) attached to a continuous shaft (10), 
a drag rail (5) being attached to the sliding body (1) 

via a drag link (3), which drag rail (5) fills the gap in 
the running rail (8) in the closed position of the 

sliding panel. 
Extension device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the sliding body (1) mounted on 

roller-bearing rollers (2) and the drag rail (5) having 
drag link (3), and the guide housing (4) form an assembly 

unit.
