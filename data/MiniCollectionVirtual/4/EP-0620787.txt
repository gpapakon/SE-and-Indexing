<ABSTRACT>
A two bus system to accomplish: (1) communication from contact pairs located at vehicle access points such as a vehicle door or trunk to a central controller (14); and (2) transmitting current for energization of actuators (18, 24) to implement respective commands such as normal lock or super lock. The contact pairs (26-32) function to provide entry ports for commands as well as providing status signals of various points of interest. The contact pairs are connected to individual output ports of a counter (14). Each contact pair is sequentially pulsed by a signal pulse of a pulse train provided by the central controller. If a contact pair is engaged or closed when pulsed, the pulse will cause a coincident bus loading to occur. The central controller (14) monitors bus loading and is appraised of the contact status by the coincidence (or lack thereof) of a pulse and a respectively loaded bus. Upon determination of the contact statuses, the central controller accesses a look-up table and then implements the respective commands by energizing one of several relays that define path for flow of current to respective actuators.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for controlling actuators using 
contacts having a remotely located controller and, more particularly, to a 
system incorporating a minimum number of wires for controlling actuators 
using contacts having a remotely located controller. Automobiles incorporate several contact pairs in the operation of 
vehicle doors. These contact pairs function as entry stations for commands 
to accomplish vehicle locking, unlocking, in addition to providing status 
information such as door ajar. These contact pairs communicate information 
to a remotely located controller. A conventional wiring harness 
interconnecting the contact pairs and controller requires a dedicated wire for 
each contact pair plus a common wire. As a result, substantial cost and 
weight is associated with the respective wiring harness. A reduction in 
weight may be accomplished by implementing a system incorporating a 
multiplexing concept in which each contact pair is connected through a 
common bus to the central controller. In such a multiplexing system each 
contact pair is provided with a module which generates a uniquely signatured 
signal which is then transmitted to the controller. The signal is then 
correlated by the controller to a respective command which the controller 
then implements by energizing actuators using a second bus. Such a system 
results in a reduction in wiring harness cost and weight but requires a 
substantial investment in the hardware necessary to produce the uniquely 
signatured signal. Alternatively, a multiplexing system disclosed in EP-A-0 
281 376 (the features of which correspond to the preamble of claim 1) 
teaches a contact pair connected to a bus wherein a control unit 
providing a pulse train along the bus is modified to provide indicia of the 
contact pair position. The control unit is arranged to detect any such pulse 
modification to identify the condition of a respective contact pair. Expensive  
 
and sophisticated electronics are required to perform in conjunction with each 
contact pair. Further, DE-A-35 40 945 discloses a system for energizing 
actuators according to a command provided by a series of switches. To 
implement, such a system requires a comparator function to be provided 
remotely or in the alternative an individual wire for each switch to be provided 
and connected to a single central comparator function. The cost of 
comparator and/or multiple wires is disadvantageous. Therefore there is a 
need to develop a low-cost, minimum weight system for
