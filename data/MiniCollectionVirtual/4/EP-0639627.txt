<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to non-chromate, 
non-fluoride, non-heavy metal coatings for metals. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to a treatment for metals 
which is free of chromate, fluoride and heavy metals which 
improves the corrosion resistance and adhesion properties of a 
metal surface. The present invention provides a treatment which 
may be dried in place and which is particularly effective at 
treating aluminum coil and formed aluminum. The purposes of the formation of a chromate conversion 
coating on a metal surface are to provide corrosion resistance, 
and improve adhesion of coatings. The conversion coating improves 
the adhesion of coating layers such as paints, inks, lacquers and 
plastic coatings. A chromate conversion coating is typically 
provided by contacting a metal surface with an aqueous composition  
 
containing hexavalent or trivalent chromium ions, phosphate ions 
and fluoride ions. Concerns exist regarding the pollution effects 
of the chromate or phosphate discharged into rivers or waterways 
by such processes. Because of the high solubility and the strongly 
oxidizing character of hexavalent chromium ions, conventional 
chromate conversion processes require extensive waste treatment 
procedures to control their discharge. In addition, the disposal 
of the solid sludge from such waste treatment procedures is a 
significant problem. Attempts have been made to produce an acceptable chromate 
free conversion coating for metals such as aluminum. Chromate 
free conversion coatings based upon complex fluoroacids and heavy 
metals are known in the art, however, they have not enjoyed wide-spread 
commercial acceptance. U.S. Patent No. 4,191,596 which 
issued to Dollman et al., discloses a composition for coating 
aluminum which comprises a polyacrylic acid and H₂ZrF₆, H₂TiF₆ 
or H₂SiF₆. The '596 disclosure is limited to a water soluble 
polyacrylic acid or water dispersible emulsions of polyacrylic 
acid esters in combination with the described metal acid at a pH 
of less than about 3.5. U.S. Patent No. 4,921,552 which issued to Sander et al., 
discloses a non-chromate coating for aluminum which is dried in 
place which forms a coating having a weight from about 6 to 25 
milligrams per square foot. The aqueous coating composition 
consists essentially of more than 8 grams per liter dihydrohexafluozirconic 
acid, more than 10 grams per liter of water soluble  
 
acrylic acid and homopolymers thereof and more than 0.17 grams per 
liter hydrofluoric acid.
