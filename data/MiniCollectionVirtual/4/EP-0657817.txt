<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic postage metering systems, and like
systems, having a microprocessor control system utilizing a programmable
microprocessor in bus communication with an integrated circuit.EP-A-0 359 235 describes a method for assigning the addressable area of a
memory to a memory address space in a programmable fashion. A microprocessor control system is conventionally
utilized in an electronic postage meter (EPM) to control
such system functions as printing, accounting, envelope
feeding and interface operation of the meter. The degree
of control system complexity varies depending on the EPM
model under control. For example, the Pitney Bowes Model
6900 series EPMs are a hand-feed stand- alone meter with
a very limited feature set, while the Pitney Bowes model
6500 series meter is a high-throughput metering system
which can be interfaced with scales and automatic
envelope feeding devices. Because of the variation of
system control requirements, it has been conventional to
develop a unique microprocessor control system for each
meter model. It should be noted that the variance
between systems is not only a matter of size and
functionality but, also, architecture. For example, the
Model 6900 series meters utilize flat bed printing
techniques while the Model 6500 series meters utilize
rotary drum printing techniques. Another printing
technique known suitable for use in postage meters is
thermal printing.As a result, it is customary for each meter model to
have a unique control system incorporating different
microprocessors, different application specific
integrated circuits (ASICs), different memory devices and
a variety of other electrical components. It should be
appreciated that the principal cost and time factor is in
developing, testing and qualifying the various ASICs.It is an object of the present invention to present
an ASIC having a programmable module such that a single
ASIC is suitable for application to a range of postage
meter models.It is a still further objective of the present
invention to present an ASIC having registers for
receiving parameter data from a programmable 
microprocessor whereby the respective modules of the ASIC
are re-configurable in accordance with the parameter data
such that a single ASIC is suitable for utilization among
a number of postage metering system having various
functionality sets.According to the invention, there is provided a control
system for generating control signals to control electrical
components of an electronic postage meter
