 UNIVERSAL NON-JAMMING MULTI-PLY MULTI-FOLD OUTSERT WITHOUT OPEN EDGES (AND RELATED METHOD)BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a universal package outsert, and related method, and more particularly, to a universal, multi¬ ply, non-jamming, package outsert having multiple folds, which is manufactured from an integral sheet of stock, the outsert having no open edges about its periphery, which are inserted into (or otherwise applied to) packages to provide printed information, instructions and/or warnings to the users of the product, for example, for pharmaceutical products, and the like.With respect to high-speed manufacturing of package outserts, a significant and important development is depicted in United States Letters Patent No. 4,812,195 issued March 14, 1989 titled "Method And Apparatus For Making Outserts" (to VIJUK) where outserts are taught to be initially manufactured in multi¬ ples (say, of two, four, or six across) and then slit into indi¬ vidual outserts. This particular reference is a major advance¬ ment in the prior art with respect to increased speeds of opera¬ tion of the associated machines and equipment used to manufacture folded outserts, as well as in the actual construction of the outsert itself, to facilitate high-speed manufacturing of the 

outsert. The completed outsert described in this patent is folded a number of times with the outermost fold of the outsert being glued tight to an inner fold to make a tight folded outsert having open edges about its periphery. Occasionally, open pe¬ ripheral edges of an outsert may become problematic with respect to any manufacturing process, as the edges may get snagged or otherwise caught by the equipment used. The more folds an out¬ sert contains, the thicker the outsert becomes, and the more problematic open edges of a completed outsert become. According¬ ly, it would be advantageous to develop a universal multi-ply, multi-fold compact outsert that has no open edges about its periphery and which is manufactured without the need to trim the completed outsert to an acceptable size.Esthetically, and practically, the copyspace of a multi-ply, multi-fold outsert is limited by the height of the outsert (i.e., limited to a maximum of about three inches high) and/or by the overall length of the outsert (i.e., limited to a maximum of about forty inches long) . The size of the lettering used for the printed informational material has become an indus¬ try trend at legible type size (i.e., six point type size). This problem has
