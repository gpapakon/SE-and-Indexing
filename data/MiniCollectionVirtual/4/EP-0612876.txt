<ABSTRACT>
A floor covering (1) formed from a flat web has on its underside (3) knobs (5) which resemble islands and are made integral and which consist of a multiplicity of individual fibres. On its top side (2), the floor covering (1) preferably has a structure. The structures of the two sides (2, 3) are formed by means of needling. During the laying of the floor covering (1), the knobs (5) come to rest on the floor base. This results, on the under side (3) of the floor covering (1), in a channel system which is beneficial to a flow-off of water. A floor covering (1) designed in this way is preferably used in the open, for example as the covering of a tennis court, and granulate can be introduced into the depressions on the top side.

<CLAIMS>
Non-woven floor covering (1) which has on its underside 
(3) which is intended to lie on the floor, raised parts (5) 

like islands, integrally formed from the floor covering (1), 
characterized in that the raised parts (5) cover only such a 

proportion of the surface of the underside that the predominant 
part of the underside is available for the formation of drainage 

channels, and that the upper side has a different structure 
to that of the underside. 
Floor covering according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, in the surface areas of the floor covering (1) opposite 

to an individual raised part (5), in each case an indentation 
(6) has been recessed. 
Floor covering according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the raised parts (5) are formed by needling. 
Floor covering according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the raised parts (5) are arranged in rows 

and columns. 
Floor covering according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the raised parts (5) contrast in colour 

with the rest of the floor covering (1). 
Floor covering according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the raised parts (5) are formed as burls, 

each individual burl (5) being formed from a multiplicity of 
individual fibres. 
Floor covering according to one of the preceding claims, 

characterized in that the upper side (2) of the floor covering 
(1) opposite the raised parts (5) has a structure formed by 

elevations (4).  
 
Floor covering according to Claim 7, characterized in that 
the structure is designed as a deposit zone for granulate. 
Method for producing a floor covering according to one of 
Claims 1 to 8, where, starting from a pre-needled flat fleece 

(10), the upper side of the flat fleece (10) is structured by 
needling in at least one operation, characterized in that, on 

the underside of the flat fleece (10), raised parts (5) are 
formed by needling, which cover only such a proportion of the 

surface of the underside that the predominant part of the underside 
is available for the formation of drainage channels, 

the upper side receiving a different structure in comparison 
with the underside. 
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in that, on a 
structuring needle machine, in a first operation the upper side 

of the flat fleece (10) is constructed by needling by means of 
at least a needle board (12) and a lamellar grid (13), that 

thereafter the floor covering (15) formed in this way is turned 
so that the original upper side comes to lie underneath that 

thereafter the needle board(s) (12, 12A) and the lamellar 
grid(s) (13, 13A) are adapted to the underside to be constructed 

or exchanged, and that thereafter the raised parts (5) 
on the underside of the floor covering (1) are constructed by 

means of needling. 
Method according to Claim 9 or 10, characterized in that 
the needling for constructing the raised parts (5) takes place 

from the side of the floor covering (1) opposite the raise 
parts (5) to be formed. 
Method according to one of Claims 9 to 11, characterized 
in that an individual raised part (5) is formed by plunging in 

a single needle (14) repeatedly, the floor covering (1) being  
 

continuously moved in one direction during the formation of 
these raised part(s) (5). 
Method according to Claim 12, characterized in that a multiplicity 
of raised parts (5) are formed simultaneously. 
Use of a floor covering which is formed according to one 
of the Claims 1 to 8, characterized in that it is used in areas 

in which regular precipitation or wetness occurs. 
Use of a floor covering according to Claim 14, characterized 
in that it is used as a tennis court covering outdoors. 
Use of a floor covering according to Claim 14, characterized 
in that it is used as an outdoors carpet, for example as a 

lawn carpet. 
Use of a floor covering according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that it is used as a dirt trap, for example in a dirt 

lock.
