<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for controlling a drive unit are proposed, execution of the driver's intention to adjust the engine power output being delayed during the transition from the overrun phase into the traction phase, vibrations and bucking in the transition from overrun to traction operation being prevented.

Method for controlling a drive unit of a 
vehicle, having a setting element (14, 16, 18) for 

influencing the power which is set on the basis of the 
driver's wishes (FP), on transition from overrun operation 

to traction operation the execution of the 
driver's wishes for setting the power taking place with 

a delay if the change (FP ˙) in the driver's wishes 
exceeds a maximum value (FP ˙max), characterized in that 

the maximum value (FP ˙max) of the change (FP ˙) in the 
driver's wishes depends on the transmission ratios (G) 

in the drive train. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the power is set by electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, 

etc. setting of the setting element on the basis 
of the driver's wishes recorded by the accelerator 

pedal actuation. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that on transition from overrun 

to traction operation, the delay is active until 
the traction phase actually commences. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the actual commencement of the traction phase is 

assumed when, in the case of an engine rotational speed 
change, a corresponding change in the wheel speeds of a 

driven wheel is recognized, taking account of the 
transmission ratios of the drive train. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the delay in the 

execution of the driver's wishes is active until a 
specified maximum time has elapsed after the actuation  

 
of the accelerator pedal in order to leave overrun 

operation. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that on the basis of engine 

rotational speed and engine temperature, a position 
value for the power setting element is specified which 

corresponds to overcoming the internal friction of the 
drive unit and the drive train, and in that overrun 

operation is assumed when the recorded position value 
of the power setting element is less than this value. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that after recognition of the actual commencement of 

the traction phase, the delay in the execution of the 
driver's wishes is stopped and the power setting 

element is set to correspond with the driver's wishes. 
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that, after the maximum time has elapsed, the delay in 

the execution of the driver's wishes is stopped and the 
power setting element is set to correspond with the 

driver's wishes. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that if the change in the 

driver's wishes is less than the maximum, the delay in 
the execution of the driver's wishes is stopped and the 

power setting element is set to correspond with the 
driver's wishes. 
Method according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the delay in the execution 

of the driver's wishes is carried out by controlling 
a setting value for the power setting element in 

accordance with a specified time function, linear, 
exponential or parabolic, etc. 
Appliance for controlling a drive unit of a 
vehicle, having a setting element (12, 14, 16) 

influencing the drive power, having a control unit (20) 
which sets the setting element to correspond with the 

driver's wishes (FP), the control unit (20) comprising 

means (64, 78, 66) which, on transition from overrun 
operation to traction operation, delay the execution of  

 
the driver's wishes (FP) for setting the power if the 

change (FP ˙) in the driver's wishes exceeds a specified 
maximum value (FP ˙max), characterized in that the 

control unit (20) comprises means (78) which prescribe 
the maximum value of the change (FP ˙max) in the driver's 

wishes as a function of the transmission ratios (G) in 
the drive train.
