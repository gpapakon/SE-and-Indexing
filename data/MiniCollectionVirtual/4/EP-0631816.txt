<ABSTRACT>
Bottles containing differing reagents for 
use in an automated analyzer using liquid reagents 

need to be kept in a prescribed position so that the 
correct solution is always drawn by the analyzer. 

This is conventionally achieved by either having 
bottles of differing sizes, which cannot be 

interchanged in the holder, or by sealing the holder 
so that the bottles cannot be re-positioned. 

Described herein is a bottle holder (10) for 
restrictively holding two bottles (B1, B2) in 

prescribed positions, the holder (10) comprising a 
base (12), a top member (30), and a sidewall (60) 

connecting the base (12) to the top member (30). The 
bottles (B1, B2) are mounted between the base (12) and 

top member (30), the top member (30) having a sliding 
fit with the sidewall (60). An interlock fit is 

utilised to effect sealing of the bottles (B1, B2) 
within the holder (10) which comprises at least one 

tooth (90) on the top member (30) which slides over a 
ledge (100) on the sidewall (60) until each tooth (90) 

fits under the ledge (100) in a locking manner to 
prevent disassembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to bottle holders for 
reagents. In an automated analyzer using liquid 
reagents in a reaction cuvette to assay for an analyte 
in a patient sample liquid, it is conventional to 
supply the different reagents from a plurality of 
different bottles held in a bottle holder. An example 
of such a holder is described in US-A-5 075 082. In such a holder, it is important that each 
bottle be kept at its prescribed position and that the 
user must not be able to re-position (i.e., switch) 
the bottles, either deliberately or by accident, lest 
the analyzer withdraw the wrong reagent from a given 
position in the holder. Such bottle position 
integrity is maintained by the construction described 
in US-A-5 075 082 by reason of a) the size differences 
between the bottles and the construction of the holder 
to receive only those sizes, and b) the use of welding 
to integrate the holder so that it cannot be later reopened 
and the bottles re-positioned. However, it is preferred that identical 
bottle sizes be available, rather than distinguishing 
positions in the holder solely by bottle size. This 
allows for bottle interchangeability, when filling the 
bottles during manufacturing. Further, a construction 
which requires the parts to be welded together to 
prevent bottle re-positioning, is obviously more 
expensive than a construction assembled simply by 
sliding parts together. However, any assembly by 
sliding can be undone by reversing the sliding, thus 
making it easy for a user to re-position the bottles. Therefore, it has been a problem prior to 
this invention to provide a bottle holder for use as 
described, which is more readily assembled than is  
 
possible by welding, and yet ensures substantial 
permanence in the assembly to prevent bottle re-positioning. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide a bottle holder which solves the 
problems mentioned above. More specifically, in accordance with one 
aspect of the present invention, there is provided a 
bottle holder for holding at least two bottles 
containing differing substances in prescribed 
positions, each bottle having a bottom end and an 
access end, the holder comprising:-
 
   a base with at least one recess formed 
therein and shaped to retain the bottom ends of the 
bottles;
 
   a top member disposed above and opposite the 
base and having at least one recess formed therein 
which is shaped to retain the access ends of the 
bottles; and
 
   a sidewall extending between and joining 
together the

<CLAIMS>
A bottle holder (10) for holding at 
least two bottles (B1, B2) containing differing 

substances in prescribed positions, each bottle (B1, 
B2) having a bottom end (42) and an access end (40), 

the holder (10) comprising:- 
   a base (12) with at least one recess (14, 

16) formed therein and shaped to retain the bottom 
ends (42) of the bottles (B1, B2); 

   a top member. (30; 30A) disposed above and 
opposite the base (12) and having at least one recess 

(34, 36, 38) formed therein which is shaped to retain 
the access ends (40) of the bottles (B1, B2); and 

   a sidewall (60; 60A) extending between and 
joining together the base (12) and the top member (30; 

30A); 
   characterized in that the top member (30; 

30A) and the sidewall (60; 60A) further comprise an 
interlock (90, 92, 94, 100, 102; 90A, 92A) shaped to 

substantially permanently secure the top member (30; 
30A) to the sidewall (60; 60A) with the bottles (B1, 

B2) within the recesses (14, 16, 34, 36, 38), the 
interlock further including a) on either one of the 

top member (30) and the sidewall (60A), at least one 
locking tooth (90; 90A) biased to project out beyond a 

portion of the top member (30) and the sidewall (60A), 
and b) on the other one of the top member (30A) and 

the sidewall (60), a recess (102) bounded by a ledge 
(100; 92A), the recess (102) being shaped and sized to 

capture each locking tooth (90; 90A) under the ledge 
(100; 92A). 
A holder according to claim 1, wherein 
the top member (30; 30A) and the sidewall (60; 60A)

sliding one on to the other so that each tooth (90; 

 
90A) slides past the ledge (100; 92A) into the recess 

(102) into a substantially permanent locked 
configuration so that the bottles (B1, B2) cannot be 

re-positioned.

(80, 84) on either one of the top member (30A) and 
sidewall (60), and a notch (82, 86) on the other of 

the top member (30) and sidewall (60A), the notch (82, 
86) being dimensioned so as to receive the rail (80,
