<ABSTRACT>
A misfire detection apparatus and method is 
provided for detecting misfire in cylinders of an 

internal combustion engine in a motor vehicle. The 
method includes sensing ionization current through spark 

plugs in either a distributorless ignition system or a 
distributor ignition system. The method also includes 

disabling ionization current sensing during ignition 
coil discharge time. The method further includes making 

and storing the combustion ionization measurements in 
order to determine if a misfire has occurred and if 

catalyst damage has occurred due to the misfire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
internal combustion engines and, more particularly, to 
a misfire detection apparatus and method for an internal 
combustion engine. The Clean Air Act (1955) required motor 
vehicle manufacturers to reduce exhaust emissions of 
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen 
from light-duty motor vehicles. To comply with the Act, 
most motor vehicle manufacturers have used catalytic 
convertors on production motor vehicles to control such 
exhaust emissions. Recently, regulatory agencies have proposed 
that passenger, light-duty and medium-duty motor 
vehicles with feedback fuel control systems be equipped 
with a malfunction indicator light that will inform the 
motor vehicle operator of any malfunction of an 
emission-related component that interfaces with an on-board 
computer of the motor vehicle. It is also 
proposed or required that an on-board diagnostic system 
identify the likely area of malfunction. Proposals or  
 
requirements have set forth catalyst, misfire, 
evaporative purge system, secondary air system, air 
conditioning system, fuel system, oxygen sensor, exhaust 
gas recirculation, and comprehensive component 
monitoring requirements. Misfire of internal combustion engines can 
damage the catalyst of a catalytic convertor. With 
respect to misfire, the identification of the specific 
cylinder experiencing misfire may be required. Some 
regulations provide that the motor vehicle manufacturer 
specify a percentage of misfires out of the total number 
of firing events necessary for determining malfunction 
for: (1) the percent misfire evaluated in a fixed number 
of revolution increments for each engine speed and load 
condition which would result in catalyst damage; (2) the 
percent misfire evaluated in a certain number of 
revolution increments which would cause a durability 
demonstration motor vehicle to fail a Federal Test 
Procedure (FTP) by more than 150% of the applicable 
standard if the degree of misfire were present from the 
beginning of the test; and (3) the degree of misfire 
evaluated in a certain number of revolution increments 
which would cause a durability demonstration motor 
vehicle to fail an Inspection and Maintenance (IM) 
program tailpipe exhaust emission test.  It is, therefore, one object of the present 
invention to provide an apparatus and method of misfire 
detection for an internal combustion engine. It is another object of the present invention 
to use an ionization circuit for misfire detection. It is yet
