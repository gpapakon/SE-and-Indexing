<ABSTRACT>
A motor-driven movement and angular positioning assembly for 
toolholder headstocks comprises a shaft (1), driven by a 

respective motor, for the transmission of rotary motion to a 
tool (4) mounted on said toolholder headstock (5); a first 

assembly of mechanical elements (7,9), rotating integrally with 
said shaft (1), and a second assembly of mechanical elements 

(12,16,18), rotating integrally one with the other around the 
axis of rotation of the shaft (1), attached whereto is an 

eccentric shank (28) wherewith said headstock (5) is provided, 
comprise mechanical elements (9,12) which can be engaged 

mechanically one with the other, under the action of an 
actuator governed by a control unit, in order to exploit the 

rotary motion of the shaft (1) for transmitting circular motion 
to said shank (28) for angularly positioning said toolholder 

headstock (5). A braking element (20) is moreover provided and 
which can be engaged with the mechanical elements (12,16,18) of 

the second assembly to block their rotary motion during their 
disengaging from the mechanical elements (7,9) of the first 

assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the present invention is a movement and 
angular positioning assembly for toolholder headstocks, 
particularly but not exclusively for machines for the 
processing of wood. Machine tools for the processing of wood are known wherein a 
tool, mounted on a toolholder headstock by means of a spindle, 
is made to rotate by a suitably motor-driven shaft, while the 
toolholder headstock is positioned angularly by means of a 
separate shaft which, via a pulley transmission or other moving 
part, drives rotation of the headstock. In these machines, since two separate shafts are provided, 
two respective electronic units are required to control their 
motion, which entails constructional complications and higher 
production costs. In view of the state of the art described, the object of the 
present invention is to provide a motor-driven assembly for a 
machine tool which, governed by a single electronic control 
unit, actuates both movement and angular positioning of a tool. In accordance with the present invention, this object is 
achieved thanks to a motor-driven movement and angular 
positioning assembly for toolholder headstocks, comprising a 
shaft, actuated by a respective motor, for transmission of 
rotary motion to a tool mounted on said toolholder headstock, 
characterised in that it comprises a first assembly of 
mechanical elements rotating integrally with said shaft and a 
second assembly of mechanical elements rotating integrally one 
with the other around the rotation axis of the shaft, attached  
 
whereto is an eccentric shank wherewith said headstock is 
provided, the mechanical elements of said first and second 
assembly being engageable mechanically one with the other, 
under the action of an actuator governed by a control unit, in 
order to exploit the rotary motion of the shaft to transmit a 
circular motion to said shank for positioning said toolholder 
headstock angularly, a braking element also being provided and 
which can be engaged with the mechanical elements of said 
second assembly in order to block the rotary motion of the 
mechanical elements of said second assembly during their 
disengaging from the mechanical elements of said first 
assembly. Thanks to the present invention, a machine tool can be built 
which only requires one electronic control unit for controlling 
the movement of the tool and that of the headstock which 
supports it. This simplifies the machine, and leads to a 
considerable saving in production and maintenance costs. These and other features of
