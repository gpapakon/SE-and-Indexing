<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a power transmission with two hydraulic motors (12, 13) which are connected to an adjustment pump (11) and act on an output shaft via a transmission, at least one of said hydraulic motors (12, 13) being constructed as an adjustment motor (12). In particular, the invention relates to the arrangement of the appropriate driver or output shaft (22, 23, 35). The intention is to provide an infinitely variable multi-range hydraulic power transmission which achieves high conversion ratios with constructionally simple means, is compact and has few components.

A drive, comprising two hydraulic engines (12, 13) 
connected in parallel feed to a variable-displacement 

pump (11) and acting on a gear system on an output 
shaft, which engines are paraxial and are arranged 

opposite one another on one side of a transmission of 
the output shaft, and at least one of which is designed 

as a variable-displacement engine, with a first 
hydraulic engine (12) designed as a variable-displacement 

engine having a drive shaft (22) which 
merges into the output shaft (35), and a clutch (26) 

being provided in the transition from the drive shaft 
to the output shaft, which clutch is surrounded by a 

hollow wheel (25) of a transmission which meshes with a 
spur wheel driven by the second hydraulic engine,
 
characterised in that
 
the hydraulic engines can be taken out of operation, 

that the output shaft (35) is connected at the head end 
via a spur wheel (32) and a pinion (33) to a pot-shaped 

housing (31) for a drive element (30) designed as a 
planetary gear, which has a closing crosspiece (36) 

which is mounted in the transmission housing (21), and 
that elements (17, 18 or 19) are provided by means of 

which the feed line (15) and the return line (16) of 
the hydraulic feed of the hydraulic engine (12 or 13) 

which is out of operation can be shut off. 
A drive according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the elements (17, 18) are hydraulic valves in the 

form of 4/2-path valves which are connected to the 
hydraulic engines (12, 13) designed as variable-displacement 

engines. 
A drive according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the elements (19) are control instruments of the  

 
hydraulic engines (12, 13) which are designed as zero-stroke 

engines. 
A drive according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised 
in that the hydraulic engines (12, 13) located on the 

side opposite the drive element (30) partially project 
into the transmission housing (21). 
A drive according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that a brake (41) is provided on the output shaft (35), 

supported on the outside of the transmission housing 
(21). 
A drive according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the pot-shaped housing (31) is the drum of a 

winch. 
A drive according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the pot-shaped housing (31) is the tumbler or the 

wheel of a land vehicle.
