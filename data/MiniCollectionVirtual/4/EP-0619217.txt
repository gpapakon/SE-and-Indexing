<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a side panel for commercial vehicles. The side panel comprises the actual side panel, mudguards and the securing elements required therefor. The object of the invention is to provide a side panel for commercial vehicles. The intention is for the side panel to be suitable to be usable as a side panel for all types of vehicle construction, such as platform lorries, high-capacity vehicles, interchangeable-body lorries and articulated vehicles. The object of the invention is achieved by virtue of the fact that the side panel is formed from self-supporting panelling elements (4), which extend between the mudguards (3, 5). The panelling elements (4) are secured directly to the mudguards (3, 5) or to the supporting elements (2) of the mudguards (3, 5). The panelling elements (4) are hence not actually secured to the vehicle frame (1) and are therefore not affected by the design of the frame (1), for example as regards the length to be panelled.

<CLAIMS>
Side-panelling for commercial vehicles, with a panelling 
member (4) which extends, in a longitudinal direction of a 

vehicle concerned (4), between fender members (3, 5) which 
are attached to a chassis (1) by means of support members 

(2),
wherein
 
a panelling member (4) is directly or indirectly attached 

onto support members (2) of fender members (3, 5), by means 
of a lateral member (25). 
Side-panelling in accordance with claim 1,
wherein
 
a panelling member (4) is disposed such that it can pivot 

about a longitudinal axis. 
Side-panelling in accordance with claim 1,
wherein
 
a panelling member (4) is developed such that it is self-supporting 

and can be cut to length on a basis of a standard 
measurement. 
Side-panelling in accordance with claim 1,
wherein
 
support elements (2) are formed of profiled members and 

fender members (3, 5) have a lateral member (25, 27) with a 
guidance member (17), which is formed so as to negatively 

correspond to a cross-section of a support member (2), such  
 

that a guidance member (17) surrounds a support member (2), 
whereby a fender member (3, 5) can be attached onto a support 

member (2) by means of a lateral member (25, 27), by being 
pushed onto a said support member (2). 
Side-panelling in accordance with claim 1,
wherein
 
a support member (2) has points of attachment (8, 13) for a 

fender member.
