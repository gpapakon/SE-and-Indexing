<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assembly for aspirating and 
dispensing a calibrated volume of fluid of the type as described 
in the preamble of claim 1. An assembly of this type is shown in EP-A-148 333. The known assembly 
includes a pipette, a probe, and a box-shaped carrier. 
The pipette has a longitudinally extending, tapered body open 
at both ends. Spaced apart from both ends the body is provided 
with a plurality of axially extending ribs, each terminating in 
a flat surface perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the 
body. The flat surfaces of the ribs act as control members for 
precision placement of the pipettes in an aperture of the carrier 
by engagement of the flat surfaces and the upper surface 
of the carrier around the apertures. Surrounding the upper 
opening the body has an outwardly tapered rim for permitting an 
easy access for the probe to be inserted into the upper opening 
and for permitting stripper means to easily come into engagement 
with the rim for stripping the pipette from the probe. US-A-4 824 641 describes an assembly for aspirating and dispensing 
a calibrated volume of fluid including a plurality of 
pipettes, a probe and a carrier. The carrier is ring-shaped and 
includes a plurality of apertures adapted to receive and hold 
the pipettes. The pipettes have a plurality of ribs forming a 
control member for precision placement of the pipettes within 
the apertures of the carrier. A plurality of conventionally 
shaped trays are shown which include a matrix arrangement of 
the wells into which the liquids to be taken up by the pipette 
tips may be deposited.  
 It is known to utilize pipette tips in an automated 
reagent analysis system wherein a plurality of pipettes are 
positioned in a pipette rack or carrier located on the system 
and an automated probe is mounted on the end of a robot arm, 
wherein the probe is positioned over one of the pipettes in the 
carrier and inserted in the pipette for engaging the pipette. In 
the prior art, the pipette included a tapered inner passageway, 
and insertion of a cylindrical probe into the pipette generated 
a wedge fit, whereby the pipette was mounted on the probe 
and a seal was effected between the probe peripheral 
cylindrical surface and the tapered annular inner wall of the 
pipette. The robot arm then lifted the probe and pipette and 
performed a series of movements and operations for aspirating 
and dispensing both patient samples and the reagents. Upon 
completion of the operations, the robot arm moved the
