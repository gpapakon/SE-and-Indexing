<DESCRIPTION>
This invention offers novel compounds which are useful for
treatment of diseases such as immunodeficiency and autoimmune
diseases caused by various immune disorders, and synthetic
intermediates therefor.Recently, many studies have been performed on mechanisms
and therapeutic agents for diseases caused by various immune disorders
or immune depression caused by adverse reactions of carcinostatic drugs.
It is known that thymulin, a nonapeptide produced in the thymus, forms
a complex with zinc and improves a depressed immunity. It is suggested
that it could be an effective drug on immunodeficiency and autoimmune
diseases (Med. Oncol. & Tumor Pharmacother. 6, 25-29, 1989).However, there remain many problems in practical use of
thymulin. For example, the availability of thymulin is limited due to a
small yield in the thymus and duration of the activity thereof is short
because thymulin is easily decomposed by endogenous enzymes.Therefore, synthetic compounds are desired which have a long
lasting activity and can be prepared in a large amount. But few studies
have been performed on such synthetic compounds having thymulin-like
activities.The inventors focused on the action mechanisms of thymulin
forming a complex with zinc and studied to synthesize various novel
compounds having sulfur atoms in the side chains.The inventors also examined the effect of the obtained novel 
compounds. As the result of the precise studies, the inventors found that
lactone or lactam compounds having sulfur atoms in the side chains
showed excellent thymulin-like activities. Although many studies have
been performed on lactone or lactam compounds, few compounds
having sulfur atoms in the side chains were known. EP-A-0139206
discloses γ-butyrolactone derivatives having α-mercaptomethyl
substituents, said derivatives exhibiting antibody formation potentiating
activity. JP-A-56-104864 discloses lactams which are substituted at the αposition
with alkylthiomethyl, said compounds being useful as
hypotensors and anesthetics. JP-B-41-6331 discloses a γ-caprolactone
having an ε-mercapto substituent (equivalent to a γ-mercaptoethyl-γ-butyrolactone).
EP-A-0326326 discloses acyclic N-mercaptoalkycarbonyl
cysteine derivatives, which compounds thus have two sulfur atoms.
These compounds exhibit immunosuppressive activity.As mentioned later, the structural characteristic of the
compounds of this invention of the formula [I] is that a sulfur atom exists
in two of the side chains of the lactone or lactam compounds. Such
lactone or lactam compounds
