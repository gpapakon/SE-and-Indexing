<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of fluoroalkanecarboxamide
derivatives.EP-A-529 482 refers to specific iminothiazolines, their production and use as
herbicides, and intermediates for their production.A herbicidal difluoroacetamide derivative and its production process are
disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 5,312,798. However, this process has a drawback in
that it requires difluoroacetic acid which can be obtained from tetrafluoroethylene in a few
steps-process but cannot readily be produced on an industrial scale (see, e.g., Org. Prep.
Proced. Int.,19, 468 (1987)). Accordingly, there has been a great demand for developing
an advantageous process for the production of fluoroalkanecarboxamide derivatives.The object of the present invention is to overcome
the drawbacks of the conventional processes. This object has been solved
by an advantageous process for the production of fluoroalkanecarboxamide
derivatives including the above difluoroacetamide derivative which
can provide the desired compound conveniently in one-pot conversion using a readily
available fluoroolefin.Thus, the present invention provides a process for the production of fluoroalkanecarboxamide
derivatives of the formula (I):
 
wherein R1 is a halogen atom, an alkyl group substituted with at least one halogen atom
or an alkoxyl group substituted with at least one halogen atom; R2 is a hydrogen atom or
a halogen atom; and R3 is a methyl group, an ethyl group, a chlorine atom or a bromine
atom; X and Y are the same or different and each of them represents a hydrogen atom, a
fluonne atom, a chlorine atom or a trifluoromethyl group, with the proviso that X and Y
do not simultaneously represent a hydrogen atom or a chlorine atom, which comprises the
steps of:
(a) reacting an iminothiazoline compound of the formula (II):

wherein R1, R2 and R3 are each as defined above, or a salt thereof with a fluoroolefin of
the formula (III):
XYC=CF2
wherein X and Y are each as defined above, in the presence of a primary or secondary
amine compound which may be substituted with an inert group and wherein 1 to 10 moles
of said amine compound are used per mole of said iminothiazole compound; and(b) reacting the resultant reaction mixture with water.According to the process of the present invention, fluoroalkanecarboxamide
derivatives of the formula ( I ) can be produced in a one-pot conversion using a readily
available fluoroolefin.In the fluoroalkanecarboxamide derivative of the formula ( I ), as the halogen
atom of R1 and R2, there
