<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
isolating and obtaining cDNA which is specific to a 
particular tissue or cell (hereinafter, the tissue and cell 
are referred to as "a cell" for simplicity purpose) by 
"subtraction". More specifically, the present invention 
relates to a method for isolating a gene which is 
specifically expressed in a particular cell by subjecting 
genes expressed in different two or more types of cell to 
substruction. The method for isolating a gene of the 
present invention is useful in gene manipulation, in 
particular, for preparing a cDNA library specific to a 
particular cell through acquisition of a cDNA corresponding 
to a gene specific to the cell and cloning the same. As a method of analyzing a gene, it is a usual 
procedure to synthesize cDNAs from mRNAs which directly 
encode proteins and clone the same. Cloning and analyzing 
of cDNAs are useful in research on gene expression, 
development, and differentiation as well as in production 
of useful substances. Isolation of cell-specific cDNAs and 
preparation of a cell-specific cDNA library would provide a 
useful source for investigating a useful gene. Subtracive hybridization for isolating, for example, a 
cDNA clone corresponding to mRNA which is expressed in 
mouse T cell but not in mouse B cell is well known in the 
art. However, it has been difficult according to the 
conventional method to efficiently obtain a gene that is  
 
cell-specifically expressed by subjecting genes expressed 
in different two or more types of cell to subtraction. Figure 1 is a flow chart depicting a specific example 
of the first isolating method of the present invention. Figure 2 is a flow chart depicting a specific example 
of the second isolating method of the present invention. Figure 3 shows an advantage of a method utilizing a 
labeled primer (biotinyl oligo (dT) fragment) in a process 
of cDNA synthesis. Figure 4 shows a disadvantage of a method utilizing an 
oligo (dT)-latex in a process of cDNA synthesis. In the dwawings, the abbreviations have the following 
means. 
(1): messenger RNA (mRNA) (2): antisense strand cDNA (3): sense strand cDNA  
Bi: biotin
 
Fe/Av: a Fe₂O₃ particle coated with avidin
 
   As a method for reparing a subtracted cDNA library, it 
has been recently proposed to use a oligo (dT)-latex made 
of a latex particle covalently linked to oligo (dT) primers 
(Nucleic Acids Research, Vol. 19, No. 25, 1991, p. 7097 - 
7104).  Since this method uses an oligo (dT)-latex as a means 
for isolating cDNAs
