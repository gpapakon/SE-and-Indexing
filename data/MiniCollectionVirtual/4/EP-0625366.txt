<ABSTRACT>
Filter devices are known in which filter bags, filter pockets or the like are cleaned by means of fixed cleaning nozzles operated by compressed air. However, the installation of the known cleaning nozzles is highly complex and therefore cost-intensive. This also applies to the production and operation of the cleaning nozzles. It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a filter device which can be manufactured and operated more cost-effectively. For this purpose it is provided that air outlet orifices, for example the cleaning nozzles, are arranged on a transportable carriage and are arranged in a row adjacent to each other transversely to the direction of motion. In order to achieve effective cleaning, considerably fewer cleaning nozzles are required by the invention so that, overall, more cost-effective manufacture results.
