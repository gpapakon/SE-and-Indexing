<ABSTRACT>
Procedure for the creation of mattress gabions for soil revetments, 
designed to halt erosion and/or to consolidate the soil, characterised 

by a protective vegetable revetment consisting of the structure within 
the mattress which retains the soil (7) inside each individual cell. The 

invention allows each cell of the container to be filled with earth (7) 
or another earth mixture, encouraging the growth of vegetation inside 

the mattress in order to afford a natural protection to the soil of 
banks or escarpments, etc. After it has been filled, the mattress is 

closed by a top cover (9) in double twist steel mesh, after laying a 
geosynthetic (8) sheet between the two to keep in fine materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a procedure for the creation of
artificial soil protection and lining structures in the form
of mattress-type gabions made of double twist wire netting
which are filled with soil to create a protective vegetable
revetment.It is known that revetments and other protective structures
are employed to halt soil erosion caused by runoff or
precipitation; these structures are constructed using so-called
mattress gabions, i.e. rectangular containers filled
with gravel, crushed stone and other material, fitted with a
cover and consisting of galvanised or galvanised and
plastic-coated double twist wire netting panels joined
together with ties or wire stitches; these structures are
corrosion-inhibiting and resistant to mechanical stresses.One particular, well-known system for the creation of the
above-mentioned structures consists in the construction and
use of large, thin "mattress gabions" designed to cover,
without any break, extensive tracts of land of the most
disparate conformation, as if they were actual "mattresses".
Preparation in the manufacturing plants consists of working
the wire netting, the mattresses being divided into cells by
means of vertical partition walls made with the netting of
the bottom sheet.Also known is the system which directly forms the transverse 
partitions, known as "ribs", obtaining them from the bottom
sheet by transverse folds the same height as those of the
"mattress", with similar folds for the long side walls and
short end walls.The connection together of the sides of each rib, obtained by
bending the bottom sheet, with the cover sheet and with the
side and end walls is accomplished using wire stitches, some
of them fitted in the factory assemblea structure and some
placed during installation.When the container is filled with soil to act as ballast,
there arises the problem of keeping the earth inside the
structure ang preventing leaching and dispersion.Attempts are made to overcome this problemi albeit with
relatively unsatisfactory results, by using sheets of
geotextile material extended under and around the gabion.The Patent WO-A-90/12160 discloses a multiple-cell structure
which is completely assembled in panels and covered with
geotextile. This structure, being used for emergency
operations, does not include a base and roof and the
"accordion" type of folding makes total pre-assembly possible
at the site.The purpose of this invention is to permit the creation of a
system designed to hold the soil inside each individual cell
in a mattress gabion,

PROCEDURE FOR THE CREATION OF MATTRESS TYPE GABIONS
FOR PROTECTIVE VEGETABLE REVETMENTS, comprising the steps of:


(a) forming a wire mesh structure having a bottom (1) and a plurality of
upwardly open cells defined between partitions (4) constituted by

upstanding folds of wire mesh unitary with the bottom and subdividing said
structure into said cells and longitudinal and transverse walls and wire

stitching (6) said partitions to said longitudinal walls;
(b) lining said partitions, said bottom and said walls internally of said cells
with a geotextile material (5) capable of retaining soil in said cells;
(c) filling said cells with a vegetation-growth supporting medium;
(d) applying a geotextile to said structure over said cells and said medium
after said cells are filled with said medium;
(e) affixing said geotextile to said structure by wire stitching it to said
partitions and said walls at upper edges thereof; and
(f) affixing a cover (9) of wire mesh over said structure after filling it with
said medium.
The procedure defined in claim 1 wherein said geotextile material fully
lines all of said bottom, said partitions and said walls; said process further

comprising the step of stitching said geotextile material to said wire mesh
structure at least at said walls and said partitions. 
The procedure defined in claim 2 wherein said geotextile material is affixed
to said partitions and said walls as separate panels.
The procedure defined in claim 2 wherein said geotextile material is affixed
to said partitions and said walls as a single continuous sheet.
