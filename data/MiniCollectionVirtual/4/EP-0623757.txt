<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connecting system having at least two parts, of which the first part is provided with at least one portion whose cross-section is adapted to the contour of an opening on the second part. In order to produce the connection, the first part is introduced relatively into the opening of the second part. The first part is provided with a plurality of latching protrusions which are arranged offset with respect to one another in the direction of the relative displacement of the two parts which takes place upon introduction of the first part into the opening of the second part. Which of the latching protrusions, in the end position of the second part, effects the fixing thereof, depends on the position of the second part in its end position relative to the first part.

24; 110, 124; 210, 224) of which the first part (10; 110; 210) is

provided with at least one portion whose cross-section is adapted
to the contour of at least one opening (26, 28; 126; 226) on the

second part (24; 124; 224) and to make the connection can be
relatively introduced into said opening (26, 28; 126; 226) by a

relative displacement between said two parts and is provided with
retaining projections (39; 139; 239) which in the connected position

of the two parts co-operate with at least one abutment surface (50;
52; 150) on the second part (24; 124; 224) to produce a positively

locking connection between the parts, wherein in their position of
making the connection the retaining projections respectively project

beyond the contour of the opening on the second part (24; 124; 224)
and the first part (10; 110; 210) is provided with at least two

elastically deformable retaining projections (39; 139; 239) which are
arranged in mutually displaced relationship at spacings parallel to

the direction in which relative insertion of the first part occurs

second part, and the spacings between the retaining projections (39;
139; 239) are so small that at least two different retaining positions

are available within the tolerance range of the two parts, and the
at least two retaining projections (39; 139; 239) are also arranged

in mutually displaced relationship transversely to the direction of
the relative displacement, characterised in that the retaining

projections (39; 139; 239) are carried by at least two teeth (40a-d,
41a-d; 140a-d, 141a-d; 240a-d) which are arranged comb-like

transversely to the direction of the relative displacement.
An arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in that
the abutment surface or surfaces (50; 52; 150) is or are formed on

the second part (24; 124; 224) by a wall portion (30, 32) of the 
second part, said wall portion adjoining the opening.
An arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in that
the at least two teeth (40a-d; 41a-d; 140a-d; 141a-d; 240a-d)

carrying the retaining projections (39; 139; 239) are associated with
an aperture (14; 16; 116) in the portion of the first part (10; 110;

210), which is adapted to the opening (26, 28; 126; 226) on the
second part (24; 124; 224), and said aperture is defined by wall

regions (36, 38) disposed at the front and at the rear in the
direction of the relative displacement and the teeth (40a-d, 41a-d;

140a-d, 141a-d; 240a-d) extend from one (38) of said wall regions
substantially towards the oppositely disposed wall region.
An arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in that
the boundary surfaces (45) of the teeth (40a-d; 41a-d; 140a-d; 141a-d;

240a-d) at the side of said first part (10; 110; 210) at which
the retaining projections (39; 139; 239) are disposed are arranged

to extend inclinedly relative to the direction of relative
displacement in such a way that in a direction towards the retaining

projections they increasingly project relative to the contour of the
first part.
An arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in that
the thickness of the teeth (40a-d; 41a-d; 140a-d;141a-d; 240a-d) in

the direction of the axis of the associated aperture (14, 16; 116) is
at least not substantially greater than the thickness of the portion

of the first part (10; 110; 210), which has the aperture.
An arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in that
the boundary faces (57; 157) of the teeth (40a-d; 41a-d; 140a-d;
