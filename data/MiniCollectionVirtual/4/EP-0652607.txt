<ABSTRACT>
A waterproof connector includes a rubber plug 
stakingly fixable to the leading end portion of a wire to 

be inserted into a terminal storage chamber formed in a 
connector housing by a metal terminal engageable with a 

lance provided in the terminal storage chamber and 
stakingly fixable to the wire by the metal terminal. The 

rubber plug has an end terminal plug for closing the rear 
opening edge of the terminal storage chamber, and an 

expansion and contraction portion capable of expansion and 
contraction in the axial direction of the rubber plug.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a waterproof connector.In an ordinary connector, a plurality of terminal storage
chambers are formed in the interior of a connector
housing and terminals are inserted from the rear portion
thereof. In the connector of this type, especially, in the
connector housing thereof to be used in a place which requires
a waterproof condition, waterproofing means is provided
in the rear portion of each of the terminals to be
inserted into their respective terminal storage chambers.As an example of such technique is disclosed in Unexamined
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Sho. 61-26272.
In this technique, cylindrical rubber plugs are respectively
fitted with electric wires to be connected to the
terminals and the rubber plugs are made to come into contact
with the whole peripheries of the inner walls of the
terminal storage chambers to thereby secure a sealed condition
between the rubber plugs and the terminal storage
chambers. More specifically, a metal terminal is fixed to
the leading end portion of a wire and a rubber plug having
a plurality of pleats on the outer periphery thereof is
disposed in the rear of the metal terminal and is staked
and fixed by the terminal fitting. As the terminal fitting
is inserted into a terminal storage chamber formed in a
connector housing, the pleats of the rubber plug are made
to come into close contact with the peripheral wall of the
terminal storage chamber, thereby sealing a clearance between
the wire and the peripheral wall of the terminal
storage chamber. Further, as a countermeasure to prevent
the terminals from being removed from their respective terminal
storage chambers, a retainer is mounted to the rear
portion of the connector housing. The retainer includes a
securing claw, that is, the retainer can be mounted to and
removed from the connector housing by means of engagement
and disengagement of the securing claw with respect to the 
housing. Also, in order that the retainer can be inserted
in a direction perpendicular to the respective electric
wires while avoiding interference with the wires, the retainer
includes a plurality of slits which are respectively
opened downwardly and are arranged in parallel to one another.
Further, a pair of flexible projections is projectingly
formed in the opening edges of each of the slits in
such a manner that they are opposed to each other with the
slit between them. This structure makes it possible not
only to press against the rear end of the rubber plug but
also to clamp the electric wire

wherein said expansion/contraction portion (6) of said rubber

plug (1) has a bellows shape and is arranged between
said fixing portion and said slidable portion of said rubber

plug (1).
The waterproof connector according to anyone of the
preceeding claims, wherein said end terminal plug (5) is

formed in an umbrella shape, the outer peripheral surface
of which provides a tapered surface gradually reducing in

diameter in a forward direction. 
The waterproof connector according to anyone of the
preceeding claims, wherein said connector comprises:


a plurality of terminals (102) respectively for receiving
a wire (106);
a plurality of rubber plugs (107) provided on the rear
portion of the respective terminals (102) for sealing the

respective wire (106);
a housing (101) including a plurality of terminal
storage chambers (105) respectively for storing the respective

terminals (102), and housing side hold portions for
holding the respective wire (106) in part; and
a retainer (103) removably mounted to the rear portion
of said housing (101), said retainer including wire insertion

grooves (114) cut in a direction perpendicular to the
draw-out direction of wires (106) to be drawn out through

their respective rubber plugs (107) from the respective
terminal storage chambers (105) and into which the wires

(106) can be inserted, and retainer side hold portions
(115) for holding the respective wire (106) in part,

wherein each of said housing side hold portions (109) holds
