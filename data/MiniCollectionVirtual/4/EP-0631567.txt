<ABSTRACT>
A discrete catalyst and processes for the isomerization of alkanes and alkenes and the alkylation of isoalkanes with alkenes under homogeneous fluid conditions. The catalyst is formed by contacting, under fluid conditions, a homogeneous fluid containing a paraffin hydrocarbon having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms (106) with a Lewis acid/protic Bronsted acid pair (182) and, if desired, a transition metal to produce a discrete catalytic complex that is soluble in the fluid (113). The discrete catalyst is the reaction product of the acid pair and alkanes and includes hydrocarbon ligands of limited chain length rendering it soluble in the fluid. The catalyst is active for the isomerization of alkanes and olefins, and the alkylation of isoalkanes (116), under homogeneous fluid conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention provides a process for converting a
hydrocarbon having at least four carbon atoms to a
different molecular structure (i.e. isomerising) or for
alkylating a hydrocarbon having at least three carbon atoms
with an isoparaffin having at least four carbon atoms.Typical unleaded motor gasolines sold in various
octane grades in the United States today are produced by
blending together various component streams that are the
end products of a variety of hydrocarbon refining
processes. For example, a typical gasoline blend may
contain, as its components, hydrocracker gasoline produced
by catalytic hydrogenation in a "hydrocracking" unit,
cracked gasolines produced by a fluidized catalytic
cracker, reformate produced by the catalytic reformation of
naphtha, isopentane produced 
by the catalytic isomerization of normal pentane,
alkylate produced by the acid alkylation of isobutanes
and olefins, normal butane produced from the
distillation of crude oil or natural gas, etc. In
order to produce gasolines having a specific octane
rating and other specific properties, such as vapor
pressure, the relative amounts of these component
streams in the gasoline blend are adjusted. For
example, if it is desired to produce a higher octane
rated gasoline, then a larger proportion of the higher
octane rated components will be added while lower
octane components will be reduced or removed from the
blend.By way of background regarding octane ratings, it
has long been recognized that highly branched
hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as
benzene, toluene and xylene, have high octane numbers.
This means that when these hydrocarbons are mixed with
air under temperature and pressure conditions
sufficient to permit complete vaporization, and the
mixture is ignited, they burn with a steady rate of
combustion and do not burn explosively. Explosive
combustion or "knocking" will cause damage to internal
combustion engines, if continued for any prolonged
period of time. The oil refining industry has
developed standards and methods for comparing the
combustion of various hydrocarbons and blends of
hydrocarbons. 2,2,4 trimethylpentane (commonly called
"isooctane") is arbitrarily assigned an octane value 
of 100 and all other gasoline blending components are
compared with this standard.Alkylates are produced by an acid catalyzed
reaction of an alkene with an isoalkane. The alkylate
product stream comprises a mixture of multiply
branched hydrocarbon compounds of increased carbon
number. Highly branched hydrocarbon
