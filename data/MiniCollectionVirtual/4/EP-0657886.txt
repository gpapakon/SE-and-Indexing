<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic tape cartridge includes a casing having a tape chamber 
defined therein for accommodating a reeled magnetic recording tape and, also, box 

arms protruding outwardly from a front wall section of the casing so as to leave a 
loading bay that opens upwardly, frontwardly and downwardly and is thus delimited 

by upwardly, frontwardly and downwardly oriented open areas. The casing 
includes a lid assembly for selectively concealing and exposing that portion of 

magnetic recording tape and including front, top and rear lids operatively linked 
together. The front and top lids are adapted to selectively open and close the 

frontwardly and upwardly oriented open areas of the loading bay, respectively, 
while the rear lid is positioned within the loading bay and adapted to selectively 

open and close a space delimited between the front and the rear lid. At least first 
and second, generally cylindrical bosses extend between the top and bottom panels 

of the casing and are positioned at respective points of intersection between inner 
side walls of the box arms, which confront the loading bay, and the front wall 

section so as to partially protrude laterally into the loading bay. Each boss has a 
positioning hole defined axially therein so as to extend exteriorly through one of the 

top and bottom walls of the casing and is comprised of upper and lower boss 
segments aligned axially with each other. The upper boss segment has an outer 

diameter smaller than that of the lower boss segment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a magnetic tape cartridge of
a type having a protective lid assembly and, more particularly, to a mechanism in
the magnetic tape cartridge for selectively opening and closing the protective lid
assembly for exposing and concealing portion of a length of magnetic recording
tape in relation to an in formation recording and/or reproducing head assembly.The magnetic tape cartridge of the type referred to above includes, for
example, an 8-mm video tape cartridge of a structure shown in Fig. 11. This
illustrated magnetic tape cartridge comprises a casing 1 includes generally rectangular
flat top and bottom panels, opposite side walls and front and rear walls, all
of said side, front and rear walls being disposed between the top and bottom
panels to keep them spaced apart a distance to define a tape chamber. The front
wall is set back inwardly to define a generally U-shaped loading bay 6 in the casing
1 while leaving box arms on respective sides thereof that protrudes forwardly in a
direction perpendicular to the longitudinal sense of the magnetic tape cartridge.
Specifically, the loading bay 6 is delimited by inner side walls 7 of the respective
box arms, that confront with each other, and the inwardly set-back front wall 8.
This casing 1 accommodates therein a pair of reels to which opposite ends of a
length of magnetic recording tape are anchored, respectively. A portion of the
length of magnetic recording tape 2 drawn from one of the reels 3 and emerging
outwardly from one of the box arms is adapted to travel towards the other of the
box arms across the loading bay 6 and is then turned around the other of the reels.The loading bay 6 is known as a space defined to permit various tape
loading and unloading elements, forming parts of a tape loading and unloading
mechanism in a magnetic recording and/or reproducing device with which the
magnetic tape cartridge works, to be selectively inserted thereinto or withdrawn 
therefrom in response to loading or unloading of the tape magnetic tape cartridge.
Specifically, when the magnetic tape cartridge is loaded in the magnetic tape
player, that portion of the magnetic recording tape 2 traversing the loading bay 6
between the box arms is drawn out of the loading bay 6 and turned generally
halfway around the rotary head-carrier cylinder in the tape player, but when the
magnetic tape cartridge is to be removed from the tape player, that portion of the
magnetic recording tape 2 is withdrawn into the loading bay 6.While the

<CLAIMS>
A magnetic tape cartridge which comprises:

a casing (1) including top and bottom panels and a
peripheral wall disposed between the top and bottom

panels to keep them spaced apart a distance to define
a tape chamber, said peripheral wall including

front (8) and rear wall sections and a pair of side
wall sections (24), all assembled together to render

the tape cartridge to represent a generally rectangular
box-like configuration and also including box

arms (4) protruding outwardly from the front wall
section (8) in communication with the tape chamber

so as to leave a loading bay (6) that opens upwardly,
frontwardly, and downwardly and is thus delimited

by upwardly, frontwardly and downwardly oriented
open areas;
a pair of freely rotatable reels (3) accommodated
within the casing;
a length of magnetic recording tape (2) having its
opposite end anchored to said reels (3), respectively,

and adapted to travel from one reel (3) to the
other reel (3), when the tape cartridge is in use

within a magnetic recording and/or reproducing apparatus,
with a portion (2a) of the length of magnetic

recording tape (2) traversing across the loading bay
(6) at a location spaced a distance from the front

wall section (8);
