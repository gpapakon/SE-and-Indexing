<ABSTRACT>
Sealed tube (11) containing a D-T gas mixture under low pressure, provided with a target (4) and an extraction/acceleration electrode (EAE) (2) and an ion source (1) having 2n Penning cells with anodes in a single cathodic cavity (77) and one permanent magnetisation system (PMS) (81 or 82, 86 or 87) per cell. The ions formed in the ion source (1) by means of the simultaneous presence of an electric and magnetic field, are accelerated by the EAE (2) and projected onto the target (4) in order to cause neutron emission therein. In this tube, half (n) of the PMSs (81, 86; 82, 87 respectively) are magnetised to their nominal value and the other half are magnetised to a low degree or not at all. Application: neutron tubes.

a Sealed neutron tube containing a deuterium-tritium or deuterium-deuterium 
gas mixture under low pressure and including an ion source, an extraction-acceleration 

electrode and a target electrode, the ion source consisting of 2n elementary 
emission cells of the Penning type, which cells have anodes arranged in a single cathode 

cavity provided with one extraction orifice per cell along the axis thereof, and each cell 
include a permanent magnetization system, the ions formed by electron bombardment on 

said gas mixture in the ion source being channelled by a confinement magnetic field 
created by said magnetization systems, extracted through the extraction orifices pierced 

in the cathode and accelerated by said extraction-acceleration electrode, and projected 
onto said target electrode in order to produce therein a fusion reaction leading to an 

emission of neutrons, characterized in that one half (n) of the 2n permanent 
magnetization systems is magnetized to a nominal value, allowing correct operation of 

the associated cells, and the other half (n) is magnetized to a zero or low value which 
does not allow the associated cells to operate, so that selective ion source magnetization 

is obtained. 
A neutron tube as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that each 
permanent magnetization system extends along the axis of a cell and includes two 

magnets arranged on either side of the cathode cavity, among which an annular magnet 
surrounds the extraction orifice. 
A neutron tube as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, in which said ion source, with 

a single cathode cavity, includes a common cylindrical anode with 2n anode holes which 
constitute the elementary cells and are situated substantially opposite the extraction 

orifices. 
A method of manufacturing a sealed neutron tube as claimed in any one of 
the Claims 1 to 3, containing a deuterium-tritium gas mixture under low pressure and 

including an ion source, an extraction-acceleration electrode and a target electrode, the 
ion source consisting of 2n elementary cells of the Penning type, all the 2n cells 

including a common anode in a single cathode cavity provided with one extraction  
 

orifice per cell along the axis thereof, and a permanent magnetization system, 
characterized in that the first step consists in mounting n elementary cells of the ion 

source with magnetization systems already magnetized with an initial induction of a 
given direction, the other n magnetization systems being mounted in the non-magnetized 

state on the other n cells. 
A method of manufacturing a neutron tube as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterized in that when the end of the lifetime of the target section bombarded by the 

n cells magnetized in said given direction is reached, a second step of magnetization of 
all the ion source by a predetermined value in a direction opposite to said given 

direction concomitantly deactivates the n cells previously active and activates the n other 
cells.
