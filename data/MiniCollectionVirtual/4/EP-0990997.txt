<ABSTRACT>
A method for processing a given database of digital images to
create an image database without any exact duplicate image, the method

comprises the steps of providing a database digital images; analyzing one or more
digital image in the database to automatically extract depictive-feature based

representations of the image; automatically detecting exact duplicate images in the
provided database of digital images by comparing the depictive-feature based

image representations of the digital images in the database; and automatically
eliminating the redundant exact duplicate images to create a duplicate-image-free

image database corresponding to the given database.

<DESCRIPTION>
The number and size of digital image data collections are rapidly
growing. Therefore, effective and efficient image data management technologies
are essentially needed. Most of the current R&D efforts in image database
management are concerned with similarity-based retrieval. Issues pertinent to the
management of image data redundancy have been largely neglected. Like
traditional databases, duplicated or redundant imagery data is undesirable in
image databases.Most content owners with several thousand digital images are
concerned with exact duplicate image files. Duplicate images are introduced into
image databases as the result of the ease with which image files can be copied
from file systems, CD media or even other image database systems to a desktop in
an organization. Multiple image files are often re-introduced into the same system
where they originated. CD media, such as Photo CD's are often copied within an
organization for easy distribution. When organizations establish image
management systems, duplicates of the same file are often introduced into the
management workflow. Whatever the source, the lack of an automated method
for identifying and eliminating the duplicated imagery data is the key bottleneck
in effectively managing large multimedia asset collections. For such a pre-existing
collection of imagery data, it is critical to employ a method capable of
automatically detecting and/or eliminating existing duplicated imagery data and
thus resetting the base-line for the collection. This is hereinafter referred to as
database cleansing. For a collection with the reset baseline (i.e., without any
duplicated imagery data), a method that permits insertion of only new or non-duplicate
imagery data into the collection is needed to ensure the collection never
contains any redundant imagery data.Another type of control and management of the digital imagery
data redundancy is needed for collections that contain unintentional (undesirable)
"near duplicates". A form of intentional (desirable) "near duplicates" is illustrated
by a kind of image sequence called "similars". For example, in several creative 
applications, a photo shoot mostly results in a set of images called "similars".
Usually, several frames of the same scene with minor variations in content are
captured. The variations maximize the use of the scene content to meet the
demands of a variety of customers. In other words, "similars" are valuable "near
duplicates". In these applications, the value of a digital image collection is raised

(c) automatically detecting exact duplicate images in the provided database
of digital images by comparing the depictive-feature based image representations

of the digital images in the database; and,
(d) automatically eliminating the redundant exact duplicate images to
create a duplicate-image-free image database corresponding to the given database.
A method as in claim 1 wherein step (b) further comprising the
step of organizing the depictive-feature based representations of digital images in

an index structure.
A method as in claim 2 wherein step (c) further comprising the
step of searching an index structure containing depictive feature based

representations of digital images to detect exact duplicate images.
A method as in claim 3 wherein step (d) further comprising the

assist in the creation of an image database without any exact duplicate images and

containing desired near duplicate images, the method comprising the steps of:

(a) providing a database of digital images;
(b) analyzing one or more digital image in the database to automatically
extract depictive-feature based image representations of the image;
(c) automatically detecting exact duplicate images in the provided database
of digital images by comparing the depictive-feature based image representations

of the digital images in the database;
(d) automatically detecting near duplicate images in the provided database
of digital images by comparing the depictive-feature based image representations

of the digital images in the database; and,
(e) eliminating the redundant exact duplicate images and the undesired
near duplicate images to obtain an image database with controlled redundancy.

(b) representing every digital image in the database in terms of the
associated depictive features;
(c) representing the given digital image in terms of the associated depictive
features;
(d) identifying an image in the provided database whose depictive feature-based
representation that substantially matches the depictive feature-based

representation of the given image to generate the set of candidates for duplicates;
and,
(e) identifying the exact duplicate images from the set of candidates
obtained in step (d).
The method as in claim 7 wherein step (b) further comprising
the step of employing an index structure to organize the depictive-feature based

representations of digital images in the database.

(a) providing a database of digital images;
(b) representing every digital image in the database in terms of the
associated depictive features;
(c) representing the given image in terms of the associated depictive
features;
(d) identifying an image in the provided database with depictive feature-based
representation that substantially matches the depictive feature-based

representation of the given image to generate the set of candidates for duplicates;
and,
(e) identifying the near duplicate images from the set of candidates
obtained in step (d).
