<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing ceramic components used for protecting 
semiconductor devices such as ICs, LSIs, etc., from an abnormal high 

voltage due to noise, pulse, static electricity, etc., which can eliminate 
and suppress radio frequency noise in a signal line by reducing the impedance 

of the devices. To accomplish this object, at least one pulse is 
applied between electrodes (2). The pulse has a maximum amplitude of 

not greater than 50 kV, a time interval of not greater than 200 nsec from 
its initial to maximum amplitude, a total duration of not greater than 1 

Âµsec, and energy of not greater than 0.5 Joule.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
producing ceramic parts used for protecting semiconductor 
devices such as IC and LSI used in electronic 
equipments and electric equipments against high-frequency 
noises and anomalous high voltages such as 
noise, pulse and static electricity. Recently, semiconductor devices such as IC and 
LSI have been widely used in electronic equipments or 
electric equipments for miniaturization of the devices 
and for giving multifunctions to the devices. However, 
the use of the semiconductor devices causes decrease in 
resistance of the electronic equipments and electric 
equipments against anomalous high voltage such as noise, 
pulse or static electricity. In order to ensure the resistance of 
electronic equipments and electric equipments against 
anomalous high voltage such as noise, pulse or static 
electricity, film capacitors, electrolytic capacitors, 
semiconductor ceramic capacitors, laminated ceramic  
 
capacitors are used. These have excellent characteristics 
for absorption and control of noises of relatively 
low voltage or high-frequency noises, but they 
exhibit no effect on pulses or static electricity of 
high voltage and sometimes cause wrong operation or 
rupture of semiconductor devices. In order to absorb and control pulses or 
static electricity of high voltage, SiC and ZnO type 
varistors are used. However, these have no effect for 
absorption and control of noises of relatively low 
voltage and high-frequency noises and are apt to bring 
about wrong operation. Under the circumstances, SrTiO3 type varistors 
have been developed to be effective against noises of 
relatively low voltage or high-frequency noises and 
pulses or static electricity of high voltage. However, owing to the high impedance of 
elements, the SrTiO3 type varistors also have the 
problems that they are low in the effects to absorb and 
control pulses of relatively low voltage or high-frequency 
noises applied to signal lines. The inventors have noticed that the high 
impedance is caused by a barrier formed at electrode 
part. Accordingly, the object of the present invention 
is to attain the high effects to absorb and control 
pulses of relatively low voltage and high-frequency 
noises applied to signal lines by reducing the impedance 
by destroying the barrier formed at the electrode part.  
 In order to attain the above object, the 
present invention provides a method for manufacturing a 
ceramic part according to which a pulse voltage having a 
maximum value of 50 kV
