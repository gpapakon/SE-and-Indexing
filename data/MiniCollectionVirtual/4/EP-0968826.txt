<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a printing apparatus (1) of a portable type, for example,
having a carriage (27) capable of moving print heads (15,16) back and forth in a printing area in

the main scanning directions while the print heads, aligned in the main scanning
directions, eject inks onto a print sheet (PP), and ink collecting devices for collecting waste

ink ejected from nozzles of the print heads during a flushing operation where the
nozzle openings are cleaned by ejecting the inks. In one embodiment, a first flushing

area (41) for the flushing operation is provided outwardly of the right-side end of the
printing area (43). The first flushing area (41) has an area corresponding to the right-side one

of the two print heads (15,16). A second flushing area (42) is provided outwardly of the left-side
end of the printing area (43), and has an area corresponding to the left-side print head (16).

Provision of the divided flushing areas (41,42) reduces the area needed for the movements of
the carriage (27).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a flushing mechanism for a print head of an ink jet
type or the like.Some ink jet printers that perform printing by ejecting ink from nozzles of a
print head while moving the print head back and forth have measures for preventing
nozzle clogging caused by increases in ink viscosity that are caused by, for example,
dry ink in nozzles that are less frequently operated, or the like. In such an ink jet
printer, the flushing operation for recovering the ink ejecting performance of all the
nozzles of the print head is periodically performed by withdrawing the print head into
a flushing area and causing the nozzles to eject ink to an ink absorber member
provided in the flushing area.In the flushing operating, all the nozzle openings of a print head are cleaned by
ejecting ink from the nozzles. Therefore, the flushing operation cannot be performed
in a printing area, so that a flushing area needs to be provided separately from the
printing area. In the ink jet printers of this type, a flushing area is provided
contiguously or continuously to an end of the printing area, and the print head is
moved beyond the printing area into the flushing area in order to perform the flushing
operation.Some ink jet printers have a plurality of print heads for performing color
printing by ejecting a plurality of color inks from the heads. In such ink jet printers, a
plurality of print heads are disposed in the main scanning directions on a carriage.
Therefore, in an ink jet printer having a plurality of print heads, all the print heads are
withdrawn to the flushing area in order to perform the flushing operation.However, since the flushing area is provided outwardly of the printing area,
the width of the printing apparatus becomes relatively great because of the space for
the flushing area in addition to the area needed for the carriage to reciprocate during
print operation. Therefore, the printing apparatuses, especially printing apparatuses
having a plurality of print heads, tend to become large in size and impede the pursuit
of a compact apparatus design, failing to meet recent user's demands for easy 
transportation of a printing apparatus (printer) together with a mobile-type personal
computer.Furthermore, the moving distance of the carriage also increases, which is
undesirable for improvement of paper throughput.Accordingly, one aspect of the invention is to provide a high-quality printing
apparatus capable of performing periodical flushing operation and performing a
clogging-free smooth printing
