<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes a process for forming an 
intermetallic layer (31, 32) and a device formed by the process. 

The process includes a reaction step where a metal-containing 
layer (21, 22) reacts with a metal-containing gas, wherein the 

metals of the layer and gas are different. In one embodiment of 
the present invention, titanium aluminide may be formed on the 

sides of an interconnect. The process may be performed in a 
variety of equipment, such as a furnace, a rapid thermal 

processor, a plasma etcher, and a sputter deposition machine. The 
reaction to form the intermetallic layer (31, 32) is typically 

performed while the substrate is at a temperature no more than 
700 degrees Celsius.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor 
devices, and in particular, to processes for forming an 
intermetallic by reacting a metal with a gas and devices formed 
by the process. An intermetallic material is a material that comprises a 
plurality of metallic elements. Intermetallic materials, in which 
one of the metallic elements is a refractory metal, are used in 
the aviation and aerospace industries. Refractory-metal 
intermetallics are sometimes used in aircraft parts because of 
their light weight and durability compared to other metals. In the 
aviation and aerospace industry, refractory-metal intermetallics 
are usually formed at temperatures of at least 800 degrees 
Celsius. Such a high temperature of formation is unacceptable for 
the semiconductor industry. The intermetallics are usually part 
of a contact, interconnect, or via and are formed relatively late in 
a semiconductor process flow (after a silicide layer or doped 
regions, such as emitter or source/drain regions, have been 
formed). Heating a substrate to a temperature higher than about 
700 degrees Celsius is generally undesired. Within the semiconductor industry, intermetallic materials 
are being investigated to examine their ability to reduce 
electromigration and oxidation of metals within contacts or 
interconnects. An example of an intermetallic used in the 
semiconductor industry is titanium aluminide (TiAl₃). Titanium 
aluminide may be formed by sputtering or evaporating a layer of 
aluminum, sputtering or evaporating a layer of titanium, and 
reacting the layers to form titanium aluminide. This method of 
forming titanium aluminide is actually a type of solid-solid 
reaction because one solid reacts with another solid.  Although the solid-solid reaction that forms titanium 
aluminide is typically performed at a temperature less than 700 
degrees Celsius, the process suffers from several detriments. As 
used in this specification, intermetallic step coverage is defined 
as the thickness of the intermetallic layer at its thinnest point 
along the side of a patterned metal layer divided by the thickness 
of the intermetallic layer formed on the top of the patterned 
metal layer. The intermetallic step coverage is expressed as a 
percentage. Using the solid-solid reaction that forms titanium 
aluminide, the intermetallic step coverage is typically no more 
than 10 percent and may even reach 0 percent in which case, the 
titanium aluminide is not formed along all of the sides of the 
aluminum layer.
