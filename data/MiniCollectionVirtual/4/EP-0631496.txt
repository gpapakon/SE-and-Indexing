<ABSTRACT>
An injectable or implantable material for soft tissue augmentation comprising a hydrogel containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains is prepared by copolymerizing a hydrophilic monomer, such as water soluble N-vinylpyrrolidone with non-water soluble monomers, such as N-vinyl carbazole, its derivatives, or a non-water soluble derivative of N-vinylpyrrolidone. Also suitable for injection into direct contact with body tissue are hydrogels prepared by cross-linking polyvinylpyrrolidone. The hydrogel may be either solid or composed of particles. The hydrogel may also be enclosed within a flexible porous or nonporous envelope.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROSTHESIS WITH IMPROVED BIOCOMPATABILITYBACKGROUNDThe present invention relates to improved implantable prostheses, compositions and methods used to reconstruct soft tissue. More particularly, the invention relates to soft tissue prostheses combining a hydrogel within an envelope in order to minimize capsular formation and contracture, and injectable or implantable hydrogel materials for augmenting or replacing soft tissue in mammals.Reconstruction of soft tissues using a silicone elastomer bag filled with silicone gel is a common surgical procedure. Additionally, soft tissue has been reconstructed or augmented by using autografts and homografts of bone, cartilage, fatty tissue or dermis, the insertion of alloplastic implants, or the injection of alloplastic materials, such as liquid silicone collagen, or body compatible polymers solution. All of these materials have undesirable side effects. However, they are used because better alternatives are not available.An implant composed of a silicone elastomer bag filled with a silicone gel was described by Cronin in U.S. Patent No. 3,293,663 for reconstruction of the human breast. However, after a short period of time a capsule composed of fibrous scar tissue forms around the implant. It is commonly believed that silicone gel "bleeding" through the 

 bag causes an inflammatory response which results in this capsular formation. Thickening and eventual contracture of the fibrous capsule results in hardening and spherical deformation of the implant and surrounding tissues. The implant becomes painful, aesthetically unacceptable and can cause erosion of the overlying tissues.The use of saline filled silicone elastomer bags and double-lumen implants with the outer chamber containing saline, decreases the inflammatory response. However, failure of the silicone elastomer bag, especially along folds, is more common with saline filled implants. This is due to abrasion of the bag against itself, frequent flexing of the material as the patient moves, the low viscosity of the filling material, and the decreased lubricity of the saline compared to silicone gel. Rupture of a saline filled implant allows the tissue cavity to shrink as the saline is absorbed into the surrounding tissues.U.S. Patent No. 4,157,085 to Austad discloses hydrophilic polymers, such as poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone, carboxymethylcellulose, or polyethylene glycol encapsulated within a membrane permeable to extracellular body fluids under osmotic pressure. The preferred material is a very thin silicone
