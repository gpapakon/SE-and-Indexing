<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for providing durable, high performance, probing of 
semiconductor devices having a large number of narrow pitch terminals. A single 

probe of the present invention provides flexible probing of a wide range of the 
devices having various sizes and terminal arrangements. In contrast, teachings of 

the prior art require a separate probe to be manufactured or a probe to be re-formed 
for each different size and terminal arrangement of the devices. The probe of the 

invention includes electrodes (B) electrically coupled with a test system in such a 
way so as to provide the devices to be probed with a selection of more than two 

arrangements in which device terminals contacting the probe electrodes are not 
shorted with each other by the probe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to electronic probing and more 
particularly relates to an apparatus and method for wafer probing in a wafer test 
of LSI devices and for pin probing in a test of multi-pin high density LSI packages. A test system is indispensable for guaranteeing quality of semiconductor 
devices and other electronic parts and for improving the manufacturing process 
thereof. While there are many semiconductor test systems in the market (ex. 
9480A, 9490 and others manufactured by Yokogawa and Hewlett Packard), an 
advanced inspection technology is needed. Because of progress in semiconductor technology relevant design rules, 
degree of integration and number of pins of I/O tend to increase every year. For 
example, a gate array having more than 1000 pins and less than 70 micron of pitch 
is expected to appear in the next few years (see "Study on Multi-pin Probe Card" 
by Ryoichi Takagi, Masahiro Ueda and Tetsuo Tada, National Convention of the 
Institute of Electronics Information and Communication Engineers (Spring), C-641, 
1990). Such rapid increase of the number of terminals and miniaturization of size 
of terminals will make it more difficult to probe wafer terminal pads in testing them 
and to probe terminal pins in testing multi-pin high density LSI packages. In a conventional wire type probe used in a wafer probing apparatus, probe 
needles are secured on a wired rigid epoxy probe substrate by a ring. This probe 
is used in characteristic tests of semiconductor devices by contacting the point of 
the probe and flowing test signals directly to terminals of the semiconductor device  
 
to be measured. While such probes provide some advantages, some limitations 
remain. It is difficult to package the probe needles on the substrate in multi-pin 
narrow pitch because a diameter of the needles is thick. Accordingly, it is difficult 
to use such a probe to probe wafers having more than 500 terminals, less than 100 
micron pitch, and small terminal pad size. Thinning of the probe needles is limited 
in conventional processing technology. However, even if the probe needle is thinned by employing a special 
processing technology, such thinning creates new difficulties. For example, wear 
due to several tens of thousands times of touchdown increases a contact 
resistance between the needle point and the terminal of the semiconductor device. 
Accordingly, it becomes difficult to obtain a stable conductivity. Also cracks are 
readily created at the needle points. Furthermore, regular
