<ABSTRACT>
In an exhaust gas purifying catalyst in diesel engines, 
platinum catalyst is loaded on the upstream side of an exhaust 

gas flow, and palladium catalyst is loaded on the lower stream 
side of the exhaust gas flow. HC and SOF in the exhaust gas 

can be burned and removed by the platinum catalyst at low 
temperature. SO₂ is not oxidized at low temperature. The 

exhaust gas is heated to high temperature at the upstream 
portion. HC and SOF is effectively oxidized and removed by 

palladium catalyst at high temperature. SO₂ is not oxidized 
even at higher temperature. Therefore, in the exhaust gas 

purifying catalyst of the present invention, HC and SOF can be 
removed at low temperature and SO₂ is not oxidized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exhaust gas purifying
catalyst for burning and purifying HC, CO and Soluble Organic
Fraction (SOF) contained in exhaust gases exhausted from diesel
engines (DE), and for decreasing emission amount of diesel
particulate and sulfate.Concerning gasoline engines, toxic substances in exhaust
gases are clearly decreased since exhaust gases are strictly
controlled and techniques are improved. However, concerning
DE, since toxic substances are mainly emitted as particulate,
control of exhaust gases and development of techniques are not
fully achieved. Therefore, it is desirable that the method for
firmly purifying exhaust gases are developed.Conventionally, two methods for purifying exhaust gases in
DE have been known. One is the method in which trapping is
used (without catalyst or with catalyst). The other is the
method in which open-type SOF decomposition catalyst is used.
In the former method, diesel particulate is trapped to control 
emission, and it is effective for exhaust gases having high
ratio of dry suits. However, this method requires a
regeneration treatment apparatus, so a crack of a catalyst
support at the time of regeneration, a block by ash and
complication of the system occur.As disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
(KOKAI) No. 38255/1991, open-type SOF decomposition catalyst is
the catalyst in which oxidation catalysts such as metals of the
platinum group are loaded on the catalyst loaded layer such as
activated alumina, so that not only CO and HC but also SOF in
diesel particulate is oxidized, decomposed and purified. The
open-type SOF decomposition catalyst has the disadvantage that
the rejection ratio of dry suits is low. However, it is
possible to reduce the amount of dry suits due to improvement
of DE and fuel, and the regeneration treatment apparatus is
unnecessary. Therefore, it is expected that the open-type SOF
decomposition catalyst is further improved.It is difficult for the open-type SOF decomposition catalyst
to reduce the emission amount of diesel particulate. Namely,
the activated alumina layer formed in the open-type SOF
decomposition catalyst has the characteristics for adsorbing
SO2 so that SO2 in exhaust gases in DE is adsorbed into the
activated alumina layer. When the temperature of the catalyst
becomes high, the adsorbed SO2 is oxidized by catalytic action 
of catalyst metals, or SO2 in exhaust gases is directly
oxidized. As a result, SO2 is emitted as SO3, and the
particulate amount is increased. This is why SO2 is not
me
