<ABSTRACT>
A variable light modifier provides rapid beam 
deflection and flipping with a minimum of noise, power 

consumption and heat generation. In one embodiment of the 
invention, a dual-sided reflector is pivotable along orthogonal 

axes by pan and tilt mechanisms. The pan and tilt mechanisms are 
driven by pan and tilt motors, one or both of which remain 

stationary with respect to the yoke. The variable light modifier 
can be used to deflect light beams generated by one or more light 

sources and can reflect the light from one or both reflective 
surfaces of the reflector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variable light modifier comprising a reflector
mounted in a yoke assembly, the reflector having first and second axes of rotation,
the second axis being substantially orthogonal to the first axis, the reflector being
rotatable 360째 about the first axis relative to the yoke assembly and first and second
drive means for rotating the reflector about the first and second axes respectively.Such a variable light modifier is known from GB-A-2106233.Motorized lighting instruments operable by remote control typically include a
variety of mechanisms for adjusting the instruments various parameters. For
instance, such instruments may include a motor for adjusting azimuth (pan) and
elevation (tilt). Lamp enclosure assemblies suspended between the arms of a yoke
may include a motorized color changing mechanism and a motorized mechanism for
altering beam dispersion properties. Instruments using an arc lamp as a source of
light may employ a motorized mechanical dimmer.Control of motorized lighting instruments typically is provided by an electronic
control circuit located within the instrument itself. Such control circuits receive
control signals, for instance, from a remotely located light system control console. In
modern systems, these control signals may be digital signals generated in response to
stored cue programs in the console or in response to manual adjustments to console
controls. The control circuitry residing in the luminaire, therefore, in many cases is
of the digital electronic variety. As is well known, such circuitry is extremely
sensitive to heat. Parameter change motors within motorized lighting
instruments frequently receive power from an internal power
supply. Likewise, a typical lighting instrument may include an
internal power supply for lamp electronics, as well as for the
lamp itself. Because of the enormous amount of heat generated by
the lamp, the electronics and the position-changing motors, one
or more fans usually are required to provide adequate cooling of
electronic components.In addition to the foregoing mechanical and electronic
components, a typical lamp enclosure also houses the luminaire's
entire optical system, including a lamp, a reflector, a color
changing mechanism, a beam dispersion mechanism, and a mechanical
dimmer. Depending upon the design of the lighting instrument,
the lamp enclosure may also house a tilt mechanism.One problem associated with housing electronics,
