<ABSTRACT>
In order to suppress the influence of extraneous radiation on radioactive measurement processes, the beginning and the end of the foreign radiation, as well as the moment when it reaches a stable state, are determined. The difference between the measurement results before the extraneous radiation begins and the measurement results after the extraneous radiation reaches its stable state are determined, and the thus determined difference is deduced from the measurement results as long as the extraneous radiation is present. As the thus determined difference corresponds to the modification of the measurement results caused by the extraneous radiation, the measurement results obtained by deducing said difference are equal to the measurement results which would be obtained if the extraneous radiation was absent.

A method of suppressing sporadically active extraneous 
radiation effects in radio-active measuring methods, 

characterised in that the difference between the measured 
result before the commence-ment of the extraneous radiation 

and the measured result after the extraneous radiation has 
attained a stable condition is determined and that for the 

duration of the extraneous radiation the measured result is 
decreased by the calculated difference. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that in 
the absence of extraneous radiation the measured value is 

continuously stored and the most recently measured value 
before commencement of the extraneous radiation is used for 

calculating the difference. 
A method according to claim 2, characterised in that the 
rate of change and the acceleration of change in the 

measured value before commencement of the extraneous 
radiation are determined and stored and that the most 

recently measured value is extrapolated to the time of 
calculating the difference by taking into account the stored 

rate of change and acceleration of change. 
A method according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the commencement of the calculation of 

the difference is made dependent on testing for the 
attainment of a stable condition in the extraneous 

radiation.  
 
A method according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
att
ainment of the stable condition in the extraneous 
radiation is determined by checking the rate of change 

and/or the acceleration of change in the measured value. 
A method according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the determination of the difference is 

initiated on expiry of a predetermined time interval 
following on the recognition of the extraneous radiation. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that a theoretical measured value is 

calculated between the commencement of the extraneous 
radiation and the attainment of the stable condition. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the commencement and/or the 

termination of the extraneous radiation is recognised 
through changes in the measured value. 
A method according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
commencement and/or termination of the extraneous radiation 

is recognised by the detection of a local radiation 
intensity exceeding the maximum possible local radiation 

intensity of the measuring radiation source. 
A method according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
commencement and/or termination of the extraneous radiation 

is recognised by the rate of change and/or an acceleration 
of change in the localised radiation intensity, which cannot 

be process-related. 
A method according to any one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the commencement and/or termination of 

the extraneous radiation is recognised by means of further 
radiation detectors which are not exposed to the measuring 

radiation.
