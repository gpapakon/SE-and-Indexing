<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for powering up and powering down at least one 
peripheral element of a microcontroller or a microprocessor. The apparatus transforms 

a generally very active control signal into a power up/power down signal for at least 
one peripheral element. Suitable control signals are the address latch enable (ALE), 

the WRITE signal and the READ signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automatic power down elements generally and 
to elements for automatically powering down peripheral devices of a power-downable 
microcontroller or microprocessor. With the explosion of portable, battery operated systems such as portable 
computers, cellular telephones, pagers, hearing aides, etc., it has become important that each 
system consume as little power as possible so as to extend the life of the battery which 
powers it. Most prior art portable systems comprise at least a host processor operating in 
conjunction with a plurality of peripheral elements. An example prior art portable computer 
is illustrated in Fig. 1, to which reference is now made. Reference is also made to Fig. 2 
which illustrates a prior art local controller system. The prior art portable computer comprises a plurality of system elements, such 
as a host processor 2 and a plurality of peripheral devices, such as a keyboard 4, monitor 6 
and disk drive 8. The peripheral devices are connected to the host processor 2 via a system 
bus 9, such as the AT bus. Each system element typically comprises a microcontroller unit (MCU) 10 (or 
a microprocessor 11 in the case of the host processor 2) and a plurality of peripheral elements 
12 connected together via a local bus 13. Peripheral elements 12 are typically single chip 
elements,such as memories, I/O ports, timers, etc.. An exemplary system element is detailed in Fig. 2. It comprises MCU 10, the 
local bus 13, shown as an address bus 14 and a data bus 16, a plurality of peripheral elements 
12, an address decoder 18 and an address latch 20. The host processor 2 typically controls the operation of the system as a whole  
 
and the individual MCUs 10 control the operation of the specific peripheral device. Thus, if 
the host processor 2 sends a message such as "read register 3245" to the disk drive 8, the 
MCU 10 of disk drive 8 will cause the requested action to occur. As is known in the art, as the number of components in each system increases, 
the power consumption of the system increases. In order to minimize power consumption, 
microprocessor 11, MCUs 10 and peripheral elements 12 have been provided with two modes, 
an operating mode, during which the system elements perform their functions and a "standby" 
mode during which no function is performed. An optional third "sleep" mode is often also 
provided in which reference signals are switched off, further reducing power consumption. Power saving modes of the 87C51GB microcontroller,
