<ABSTRACT>
The coating of rotating members (1) with a reaction mixture forming polyurethane can be improved by using as the application nozzle a slot die (3) which is set at an angle  alpha  parallel to the axis of rotation of the member (1), and by the reaction rate of the reaction mixture and the relative movement being coordinated with the circumferential speed of the rotating member (1) in such a way that the successive windings overlap in an imbricated form and join one another seamlessly.

<CLAIMS>
Method for coating a body (1, 31) rotating about an
axis, whereby a relative movement takes place in the

direction of the axis of rotation between the body (1,
31) and a nozzle (3, 37) which ejects a reaction

mixture forming a polyurethane, so that application is
effected in helical overlapping convolutions,

characterised in that a slot die (3, 37) is used which
is disposed parallel to the axis of rotation at an

angle α, and whereby the rate of reaction of the
reaction mixture and the relative movement are

synchronised with the circumferential speed of the
rotating body (1, 31) in such a way that the

successive convolutions overlap in scale-like manner
and connect together seamlessly, in that the angle α

is adapted to the angle of the shoulder which forms in
the course of coating, so that the nozzle aperture has

a spacing of 1 to 10 mm from the point of application,
and in that the circumferential speed at the largest

diameter of the coating to be applied is adjusted to
be less than the speed at which the reaction mixture

emerges from the slot die (3,37).
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that
reaction mixtures are processed having a pouring-time

from 0.3 seconds to 10 minutes.
Device for coating a body (1, 31) rotating about an
axis with a reaction mixture according to Claim 1 or 2

forming a polyurethane, consisting of a bearing and a
rotary drive (33) for the body as well as a slot die

(3, 37), whereby either the slot die (3, 37) is
provided with a feed drive acting parallel to the axis

of rotation of the body (1, 31) or a feed drive acting
in the direction parallel to the axis of rotation is 

assigned to the body (1, 31), characterised in that
the slot die (3, 37) includes together with the

surface of the body (1, 31) to be coated an acute
angle α opening out in the direction contrary to the

direction of feed.
Device according to Claim 3, characterised in that the
slot die (3, 37) is aligned in a plane parallel to the

axis of rotation.
