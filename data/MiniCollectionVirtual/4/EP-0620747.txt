<ABSTRACT>
Self-contained drip apparatus for the administration of a liquid contained in a drip pouch, said device comprising means for expelling fluid from the pouch and injecting it into the patient. The apparatus is characterized in that the expelling means consists of a plate (3) on which is disposed the drip pouch, the plate being placed in a housing (2) having a lid (4) which closes onto the plate. The plate is urged by resilient means (6), triggered by closure of the lid and tending to force the plate back onto the lid in order to expel the liquid from the drip pouch.

<CLAIMS>
Autonomous device for injecting to a patient
through perfusion a liquid contained in a perfusion

pouch, said device comprising means for expelling said

liquid from said pouch and injecting it to the patient,
said expelling means consisting in a plate (3) on which

the perfusion pouch is arranged, said plate (3) being
situated in a housing (2) provided with a cover (4) which

can be folded back to said plate (3), said plate (3)
being acted upon by a mechanism (6) being set by closing

said cover (4) and tending to force the plate (3) towards
the cover (4) so as to expel the liquid out of the

perfusion pouch, characterized in that said mechanism (6)
is formed with four arms (8, 10; 9, 11) hinged two by two

in their center at (12, 13) so as to form two squares,
each square being connected with each other symmetrically

through rotating rolls (14, 15), arranged at the ends,
respectively, of the parallel arms (8, 9; 10, 11), the

other ends of said parallel arms (8, 9; 10, 11) being
connected, respectively, with the housing (2) and the

plate (3), and the arms (8, 10; 9, 11) of each square are
connected by two springs (16, 17; 18, 19) arranged,

respectively, on each side of the hinges (12, 13).
