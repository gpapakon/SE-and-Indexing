Ultrasonically excited honing tool oscillating with its
eigenfrequency and having a free length equal to an

integer (n=1, 2, ...) multiple of the half wave length
(lambda/2) of the ultrasonic frequency, provided with a

cutting means coating (20), the provided contour (K
v
) in
inoperative condition being determined to be different

form the working contour (K
A
) in, the excited working
condition such that the working contour (K
A
) in
ultrasonically excited condition is determined by the

provided contour (K
V
) and the amplitude (A
R
) of the radial
oscillation component (f
R
), in which between the chuck end
(30) of the honing tool (1) and the portion of the honing

tool (1), on which said cutting means coating (20) is
provided, there is a tapering transition contour (K
UE
).
Honing tool in accordance to claim 1, characterized in
that the transition contour (K
UE
) is determined such that
the ratio of the amplitude (A
AO
) of the oscillation
component in axial direction at the chuck end (30) and

of the amplitude (A
A1
) of the same oscillation component
at the free end (40) results in an amplification

(A
A1
:A
Ao
>
1).
Honing tool in accordance to claim 1 or 2 characterized
in that the chuck end (30) of the honing tool (1) is

provided with an interior cone (22) for being clamped by
the end of a sound transmission body (4) of a spindle

assembly (5).
Honing tool in accordance to claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterized in that the honing tool (1) is provided

with a flange (1) with an outer thread (21) for pulling
off the honing tool. 
Honing tool in accordance to claim 1 or one of the
following, characterized that in the area of greatest

wear (B
GV
), which preferably includes the transition
between the conical area (K
K
) and the cylindrical area, it
(100) is provided with a bellied interior bore (121).
Honing tool in accordance to claim 1 or one of the
following, characterized by a non-circular interior or

exterior contour.
Method for readjusting of a honing tool in accordance to
one of the claims 1 to 6, when wear has occurred,

characterized by plastic deformation of the honing tool
in radial direction.
Method for readjustment of a honing tool in accordance to
claim 5 when wear has occurred, characterized in that

pressure is applied to the honing tool (100) in axial
direction by a pressuring device (141) in such a manner

that it (100) thereby is deformed plastically in radial
direction in the area of its bellied interior bore (121).
Method for readjustment of a honing tool in accordance to
one of claims 1 to 6, characterized by increasing the

oscillation amplitude (A
AO
) at the chuck end.
