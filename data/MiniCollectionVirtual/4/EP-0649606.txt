<ABSTRACT>
A smoking article has a pressure drop across it 
which is in the range 250-700 mmWG at 17.5 cm³s⁻¹. The 

purpose is to minimize the volume of smoke drawable by 
smokers per puff. The pressure drop may be achieved by 

an essentially impervious portion (4) of a filter (3) 
and/or by such a portion in the tobacco rod (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to smoking articles such 
as cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos. They will be 
referred to, for brevity, as "cigarettes" hereafter. Conventionally, cigarettes are designed to have 
a pressure drop usually in the order of 60-150 mmWG 
measured at the industry standard flow rate of 17.5 
cm³s⁻¹. These figures are chosen so that there is some 
resistance to the draw on the cigarette but not so much 
that the smoker cannot vary and thereby control the 
volume taken in per puff. It is a consistent feature 
of filter and tobacco rod design that resistances must 
be controlled and kept low. The tobacco rod may, as is 
conventional, include materials other than cut leaf, 
such as e.g. reconstituted tobacco, fillers and 
perfumes. A construction which does not have a pressure 
drop of the order of 60-150 mmWG is an unsuccessful 
one. See for example US-A-3621851 where, in columns 20 
and 22, comparative examples giving rise to pressure 
drops of 473, 566 and 567 mmWG are described as 
"totally unacceptable", but where in column 24 it is 
reasserted that a "very low pressure drop" is 
desirable. This doctrine however leads to disadvantages.  Smokers of conventional cigarettes having 
pressure drops of the order of 60-150 mmWG have puff 
volumes which vary from user to user by a factor of 5. 
Low volumes are about 20 cm³ and large volumes about 100 
cm³. Low volumes are achieved by the sharp application 
of a high pressure difference across the cigarette; the 
larger volumes tend to be achieved by the smoker taking 
a long draw at comparatively low pressure difference. The effect is that the amount and even the 
nature of the smoke generated per puff will vary widely 
from user to user, leading to radically different 
perceptions of identical products by different users. 
This leads to the marketing difficulty that cigarettes 
can be identified by brand only rather than by product 
characteristics. The present invention turns conventional wisdom 
on its head. It aims to reduce as far as is feasible 
the smoker's control over puff volume with the aim of 
reducing the volume of smoke generated per puff. To this end we provide a smoking article which 
has a pressure drop across it which is in the range 
250-700 mmWG at the flow rate of 17.5 cm³s⁻¹. This 
extremely high pressure drop may be achieved by using a 
high pressure drop filter or a flow impediment in or 
attached to the tobacco rod, or both. In either case, 
the flow through the filter or impediment is  
 
essentially axial. We find

<CLAIMS>
A smoking article having a pressure drop across 
it which is in the range 250-700 mmWG at a flow rate of

A smoking article according to claim 1 wherein 
the pressure drop is in the range 250-350 mmWG at said 

rate.

2 which has a filter (3) which includes a high pressure 

drop portion (6) and a low pressure drop portion (5). 
A smoking article according to claim 3 wherein 
the high pressure drop portion (6) is of essentially 

impervious material penetrated by at least one axial 
passage (7).
