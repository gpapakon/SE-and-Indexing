<ABSTRACT>
An image processing system comprises an image
shifting circuit (2,4) for shifting an image by processing an input

video signal (P1), a scene-change detecting circuit (6) for detecting
the presence or absence of a scene change in the input video

signal, and a control circuit (4) for controlling the amount in
which the image is shifted by the image shifting circuit,

according to the presence or absence of the scene change
detected by the scene-change detecting circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image-shake correcting system for correcting an image shake due to a vibration of a camera which occurred during photography, during a reproducing operation of a video reproducing apparatus, a receiving operation of a communication receiver or the like.The image-shake correcting system shown in Fig. 1 is described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. Sho 63-166370 as one example of an image-shake correcting system suitable for use in a video reproducing apparatus having the function of correcting an image shake due to a vibration of a camera which occurred during photography.Referring to Fig. 1, a video reproducing apparatus 1 is provided for reproducing a video signal and outputting a reproduced video signal P1. An image memory 2 is provided for temporarily storing the input video signal P1. A motion-vector detecting circuit 3 is provided for detecting a motion vector from the input video signal P1 and outputting a motion vector P2 and a maximum value P3 of a correlation coefficient of the previous image and the current image. A microcomputer 4 is provided for controlling the image memory 2 and an image enlarging circuit 5, and outputs a reading address P4 and digital data P5 indicative of an image enlargement ratio. The image enlarging circuit 5 is provided for enlarging an image read from the image memory 2 up to a normal image-plane size and providing an output video signal P6. Specifically, the motion of the image is detected from a displacement between a plurality of images stored in the image memory 2, and the area of the image memory 2 from which an image is to be read is shifted in a direction in which the motion can be cancelled. Accordingly, the size of the read image is smaller than the normal image-plane size, and the read image is enlarged up to the normal image-plane size.In the image-shake correcting system arranged in the above-described manner, the video signal P1 reproduced by the video reproducing apparatus 1 is temporarily stored in the image memory 2 and is also supplied to the motion-vector detecting circuit 3. The motion-vector detecting circuit 3 detects the motion vector P2 indicative of the moving speed of the image from the input video signal P1 and supplies the_ motion vector P2 to the microcomputer 4. The microcomputer 4 determines the reading address P4 of the image memory 2 on the basis of the information indicated by the motion vector P2, and reads image information indicative of an image smaller than the original image from
