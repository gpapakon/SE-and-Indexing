<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides multi-grade spirally 
wound paperboard tubes of enhanced flat crush strength 

construction. The multi-grade spirally wound 
paperboard tubes (10) of the invention include a plurality 

of structural paperboard plies having at least two 
predetermined densities including a lower density and a 

higher density wherein the higher density is at least 
about 3% greater than the lower density. The 

cylindrical bodywall (12) is defined in radial cross section 
by at least one centrally located paperboard layer (26,28) 

disposed between at least one radially inwardly located 
structural paperboard layer (30,32) and at least one radially 

outwardly located structural paperboard layer (22,24). The 
centrally located paperboard layer is formed from the 

higher density paperboard and the inwardly and 
outwardly located structural paperboard layers are 

formed from lower density paperboard.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to multi-grade paperboard tubes of enhanced crush strength construction. More specifically the invention is directed to multi-grade multiple ply paperboard tubes having the plies positioned within the wall of the tube at locations for enhancement of flat crush strength.Paperboard tubes are widely used in the paper, film and textile industries to wind material as it is manufactured. These tubes are manufactured continuously by spirally winding multiple paperboard strips or plies around a stationary mandrel. Paperboard tubes are also made in a convolute winding process by forming a multiple layer wrap of a wide paperboard sheet around a stationary mandrel. Although paperboard is relatively weak on a single layer basis, a tube constructed from multiple spirally wound or convolute wound paperboard layers can attain substantial strength.As with other materials, paperboard tubes exhibit different strength values depending on which strength characteristics are measured. These different strength characteristics, such as compressive strength, tensile strength and beam strength, can vary according to tube construction. The standard industry test to evaluate strength of paper tubes is the flat crush test This test involves compressing a tube along its sides by placing the tube between two flat plates. One plate is stationary while the other moves at a constant displacement rate transversely to the axis of the tube. The flat crush strength is the maximum.load obtained during the test.Paperboard is an orthotopic material. Thus, paperboard properties are different in the machine direction (MD) and in the cross machine direction (CD), wherein machine direction refers to the paper manufacturing process. The property difference between the MD and CD can be attributed to the tendency for more paper fibers to be aligned along the MD as compared to CD. The orthotopic properties of paper influence tube strength and complicate any accurate prediction of tube strength.In addition, the paperboard strips used to prepare spirally wound paperboard tubes are wound at varying angles, and tube properties depend, at least in part, on the general angle of the spirally wound strips. This in turn, increases the difficulty in accurately predicting paperboard tube properties from theoretical principals. Recently, a closed-form elasticity solution has been developed to predict stresses and strains in spiral paper tubes loaded axisymmetrically. In experiments to verify this theory, a load was applied via fluid to
