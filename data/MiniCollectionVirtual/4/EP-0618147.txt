<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (1) for delivering water based 
formulations as an aerosol spray provides for 

quantities of liquid and air to be pressurised by 
pump action in separate chambers (61,59) defined by 

integrally formed cylinders (14,10). Liquid is 
dispensed through an orifice (69) via a dispensing 

channel (67) which in one embodiment is purged during 
a terminal part of the actuating stroke by the 

release of air through the dispensing channel. In a 
second embodiment air and liquid are mixed during the 

actuating stroke so as to be dispensed together and 
during a return stroke air is sucked through the 

dispensing channel to remove residual liquid. The 
air purging action prevents the build-up of deposits 

in the dispensing channel and orifice.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dispensing apparatus 
for dispensing liquids by pump action as an atomised 
spray and in particular but not exclusively to 
apparatus for dispensing water based products. It is well known in the art that pressurised 
dispensers containing volatile propellants deliver 
optimum performance for hair sprays and other 
personal care formulations. However, because of 
environmental considerations, use of such propellants 
will be minimized in the near future. Pump 
dispensers are an acceptable alternative, providing 
that alcohol is used as a solvent of these 
formulations to minimize the tendency to clog. 
Nevertheless, alcohol is a volatile organic compound 
(VOC) and such compounds also create environmental 
damage. Future VOC standards will limit the use of 
VOCs. The obvious substitute for VOCs is water. 
Nevertheless, water based formulations cause known 
types of pump dispensers to clog, particularly when 
the formulations contain high percentages of solids. A further problem is that the discharge orifice 
can become obstructed, causing the dispenser to fail. It is proposed in US 5,110,052 with reference 
to Figure 14 to provide a dispenser which introduces 
air into the discharge spray at some point during 
actuation, followed by an air purging action which 
removes the remnants of the product from the spray 
path before such remnants come in contact with the 
air, solidify and obstruct the discharge orifice. A disadvantage of the proposed dispenser is 
that the air is pumped from a cylinder formed by 
cap-like handle of the actuating means containing 
complex multi-component valve structures.  
 Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a new and improved dispensing 
apparatus which is of simplified construction and 
improved performance. According to the present invention there is 
disclosed apparatus for dispensing liquid by pump 
action as an atomized spray, the apparatus comprising 
a body defining a first cylinder within which a first 
piston is reciprocatably located to define a first 
chamber of variable volume and which in use contains 
a quantity of liquid to be dispensed; 
   a second cylinder with a second piston to 
define a second chamber of variable volume which in 
use contains a quantity of air; 
   actuating means operable during an actuating 
stroke to effect relative movement between the 
pistons and respective cylinders in directions such 
that the volumes of the respective chambers are 
reduced and during a return stroke to effect
