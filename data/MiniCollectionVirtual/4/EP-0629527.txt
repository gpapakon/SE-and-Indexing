<ABSTRACT>
A one-piece moulded plastic closure element (12) 
for an inflatable air bag restraint system (10) including a 

face portion (14) in which two air bag release doors (50, 
52) are defined by tear lines (54). Confronting arms (26A, 

26C) for locking the element (12) to an air bag housing 
(32) are located adjacent door hinge sections (62, 64) 

which are integrally formed with reinforcement ribs (66) 
which act to restrain outward movement of the doors (50, 

52) and prevent undesired closure tearing upon inflation of 
the air bag (42). In addition to or instead of the ribs 

(66) the hinge sections (62, 64) may include integral 
thickened portions for the same purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to inflatable restraint
systems and, more particularly, to an improved closure for use with
an installation of an inflatable cushion, commonly referred to as
an air bag.Safety restraint systems which self-actuate from an undeployed
to a deployed state without the need for intervention by the
operator, i.e., "passive restraint systems", and particularly those
restraint systems incorporating inflatable bags or cushions, as
well as the use of such systems in motor vehicles have been the
subjects of much discussion as the desirability of the use of such
passive restraint systems has gained general acceptance in the
United States.It is well known to protect a vehicle occupant using a cushion
or bag that is inflated/expanded with gas, e.g., an "air bag", when
the vehicle encounters sudden deceleration, such as in a collision.
During deployment, the rapidly evolving gas with which the bag is
typically filled is an inert gas, e.g., nitrogen. In such systems,
the cushion is normally housed in an uninflated and folded
condition to minimize space requirements. Upon actuation of the
air bag system, gas is discharged from an inflator to rapidly
inflate the bag. The cushion, upon inflation, serves to restrain
the movement of the vehicle occupant as the collision proceeds. In
general, such air bags are commonly designed to be inflated in no
more than about 30-60 milliseconds.Inflatable restraint systems have been devised for automotive
vehicles in which one or more air bags are stored in one or more
storage compartments within the vehicle. In general, an air bag
provided for the protection of a vehicle driver, i.e., a driver
side air bag, is stored within a housing mounted in a storage 
compartment located in the steering column of the vehicle.
Whereas, an air bag for the protection of a front seat passenger,
i.e., a passenger side air bag, is typically stored within a
housing mounted in the instrument panel/dash board of the vehicle.
In either case, the housing of such an air bag assembly generally
has a cover or some form of closure panel member. The closure
commonly includes a face portion which, in the standard state,
provides closure to the assembly and which, upon activation of the
assembly and initial bag deployment, typically forms one or more
"doors" which form an opening through which the air bag will be
deployed.In order to reduce the likelihood of tampering with the
system, the closure panel member is commonly designed so as to
minimize the visual impression of the presence

<CLAIMS>
A closure element (12) for an inflatable air bag
restraint module comprising:


a break-open area defined by one or more tear ways (46)
adapted to tear and form at least one door (50, 52) for

releasing an air bag (42) when the air bag (42) is expanded
and at least one hinge section (62, 64) adapted to join the

at least one door (50, 52) with a mounting portion (24) of
the closure element (12) securable to a module housing (32)

wherein the at least one hinge section (62, 64) includes
tear prevention means (66, 74, 76) adapted to prevent

undesired closure tearing, characterised in that;
the tear prevention means comprises at least one
integral reinforcement attachment rib (66) extending from

the mounting portion (24) to the at least one door (50,52).
The closure element (12) as claimed in claim 1
wherein said tear prevention means (66, 74, 76) is adapted

to resist rotation of said at least one door (50, 52) prior
to the tearing action associated with opening of said

closure element (12) having advanced to the end of the or
each tear way (64) and into said hinge section (62, 64).
The closure element (12) as claimed in claim 1 or 2
wherein said tear ways (46) comprise thin regions (54, 56,

58) in a face portion (14) of said closure element (12) and
form a generally H-shaped pattern defining a
t least two air
bag release doors (50, 52). 
The closure element (12) as claimed in any
preceding claim wherein the mounting portion (24) comprises

at least one locking arm (26A...26D) for engaging said
housing (32) to secure the closure element (12) thereto.
The closure element (12) as claimed in claim 4
wherein the mounting portion (24) comprises a first pair

(26A, 26C) and a second pair (26B, 26D) of oppositely
disposed locking arms with at least said first pair (26A,

26C) comprising means (44) to engage with the housing (32)
securing the closure element (12) to the housing (32).
The closure element (12) as claimed in claim 4
wherein said tear prevention means includes at least one

said reinforcement attachment rib (66) which is integral
with one said locking arm (26A...26D).
The closure element (12) as claimed in claim 6
wherein the locking arm (26A...26D) with an integral

attachment rib (66) is adjacent one said hinge section (62,
64).
The closure element (12) as claimed in any
preceding claim wherein the tear ways (46) are adapted to

tear to define both first and second air bag release doors
(50, 52) with each of said doors (50, 52) joined to said

mounting portion (24) by means of one said hinge section
(62, 64) including at least two said integral reinforcement

attachment ribs (66), wherein the mass of said second air
bag release door is greater than that of said first air bag

release door and wherein the width (W) of the hinge section
joining said second door is less than that of the hinge

section joining said first door, the hinge section of said
second door including at least one more integral

reinforcement attachment rib (66) than the hinge section of 
said first door and wherein the ribs of said second door

hinge section are more closely spaced than those of said
first door hinge section.
The closure element (12) as claimed in claim 8

section (62, 64) is proportional to the mass of the
associated door.
The closure element (12) as claimed in any
preceding claim including an upper wall and a side wall

forming said mounting portion (24), said upper wall

including the break-open area adapted to tear and form said
at least one door (50, 52) while leaving part of a

peripheral area of the upper wall outside of the break-open
area connected to the side wall when the air bag (42) is

The closure element as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein said tear prevention means additionally comprises a
