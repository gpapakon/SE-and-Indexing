<ABSTRACT>
A high solids paint composition for an aerosol including a resin which is insoluble or sparingly soluble in conventional propellants such as propane or butane and also including a solvent for dimethyl ether which is a major proportion of the resin and is also a propellant.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PAINT COMPOSITIONThis invention relates to a paint composition which is particularly intended for use in pressurised containers, that is to say aerosol containers.It has been the practice for some years to provide paint compositions in aerosol containers. Packaged in this way paints can conveniently be applied to surfaces, such as parts of vehicle bodies and the like, by spraying and without requiring the use of a brush or other application means. The conventional paint compositions for aerosol containers generally comprise the paint itself consisting at least of pigment, a resin binder and a solvent therefor and a propellant. The propellant most commonly used at present is butane, propane or a mixture of both. Sometimes carbon dioxide is used as a propellant.There are two serious problems with the conventional compositions. The first is that the propellant itself does not really form part of the actual paint, it is included in order to expel the paint composition from the container. A typical formulation comprises 35% butane propellant, 55% solvent and 10% solids which is less than half the solids content of a standard paint that is to be applied with a brush. In other words the covering power of paint contents of 

 an aerosol container is limited because of the necessity of including a propellant.The second problem is that butane is a volatile organic hydro carbon (VOC) which is environmentally objectionable.. Every time the valve of a pressured container having a butane propellant is operated to release the contents, butane is also released to the atmosphere.. It is desirable to limit the amount of VOC's that are released into the atmosphere from pressurised containers.The present invention has been made in order to deal with these problems.According to the present invention there is provided a paint composition comprising a resin and a propellant wherein the propellant is also a solvent for a major proportion, of the resin solids.In a preferred embodiment of the invention the resin employed is a acrylic resin, a modified acrylic resin, nitro cellulose or cellulose derivative or blend of such resins which are insoluble or sparingly soluble in the propellants conventionally used for aerosol paint compositions, that is to say propane and butane, useful blends include cellulose/acrylic resin blends and cellulose/al yd resins blends. Acrylic resins are only 

soluble in a limited number of solvents such as alkyl substituted low boiling aromatic solvents for example toluene and xylene, trimethyl benzene

CLAIMS
1. A paint composition comprising a resin and a propellant characterised in that the propellant is also a solvent for at least a major proportion of the resin solids.
2. A paint composition as claimed in Claim 1, wherein other paint solids are present, a solvent being provided for at least some of said other paint solids.
3. A paint composition, wherein the paint comprises a resin selected from the group consisting of acrylic resins, modified acrylic resins, nitro cellulose, cellulose derivatives and blends thereof.
4. A paint composition as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the solvent for the resin is selected from alkyl substituted low boiling aromatic solvents, aliphatic esters, aliphatic ketones and aliphatic alcohols.
5. A composition as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the propellant is dimethyl ether.
6. A composition as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the propellant is present in the amount of from 15% to 60% by weight. 


 7. A composition as claimed in Claim 6, wherein the propellant is present in the amount of from 35% to 55% by weight.
8. A composition as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the total paint solids are present in the amount of from 15% to 45% by weight.
9. A composition as claimed in Claim 8, wherein the paint solids are present in the amount of from 20% to 30%.
10. A composition as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the solvent is present in an amount of from 25% to 35% by weight.
11. A composition as claimed in any preceding claim and comprising- up to 10% by weight of a propellant which is not a solvent for at least some of the resin solids.
12. A composition as claimed in Claim 11, wherein the propellant which is not a solvent for at least some of. the resin solids is propane or butane.
13. A composition as claimed in any preceding claim contained in a pressurised aerosol container. 


14. The container as claimed in Claim 13, fitted with a delivery valve for releasing the contents at below the normal rate.
