<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns a tape recorder mechanism 
characterized by a single control lever that automatically 

stops the tape winding motor at the end of the winding 
stage. 
Said lever is oscillated during play-back and fast rewind 
of the tape by the combined and synchronized action of two 

cams, both driven by means of gears, by the same pinion 
that winds the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a tape recorder mechanism for 
stopping the tape winding motor at the end of the winding 
stage. The peculiarity of the mechanism according to the invention 
being that it operates by means of a single control lever 
instead of the two or more levers generally used on similar 
standard mechanisms currently available. The mechanism according to the invention consists of an 
oscillating lever that during play-back and fast rewinding 
of the tape is oscillated around its pivoting pin by means 
of the combined and synchronized action of two rotating 
cams which interfere alternatively and in opposite 
directions on two different points of the lever thereby 
producing a brief rotation, in clockwise and anti-clockwise 
direction respectively. The first cam consists of a frictioning lever pivoted with 
a slight interference on clutch pinion so that said lever 
is rotated (together with the clutch) by the latter when  
 
the same does not undergo a braking force, thereby causing 
the same to stop immediately and being dragged on the 
clutch pinion to which it returns spontaneously and solidly 
upon termination of the braking action of the resisting 
force. The second cam consists of a revolving disk having a hooked 
prong along the perimeter fitted on the pin of a geared 
wheel engaging with the pinion which winds the tape during 
play-back. Said cam rotates and is housed in a practically elliptical 
slot on the body of the above oscillating control lever. The perimeter of said slot having a tooth shaped so as to 
be engaged, upon interference, by the hooked prong of the 
above revolving disk. During play-back and fast rewind of the tape, said 
oscillating control lever is oscillated around its own 
pivoting pin by the alternating and opposing thrusting 
action of the two above cams: the hooked prong of the 
second cam in fact pushes against the edge of the slot in 
which the cam is housed thereby causing a brief rotation 
of the lever in one direction, while the first cam, namely 
that fitted on the clutch pinion, causes a rotation of the 
lever in the opposite direction whenever it interferes with 
the same. It is important to note that the mechanism according to the 
invention is designed to ensure that while the first cam 
applies timed thrusts on the oscillation lever, the hooked 
prong of the second cam will not engage the tooth along the  
 
edge of the slot in which the second cam revolves in that 
the first cam rotates the oscillating lever in a direction 
that consistently

<CLAIMS>
A tape recorder mechanism for stopping the tape 
winding motor at the end of the winding stage consisting 

of: 

an oscillating lever (1) pivoted on a fixed pin (7) 
fitted into slot (1d) of the oscillating lever (1), 

translating with respect to its own pivoting pin (7) and 
overcoming the resistance produced by a return spring (8) 

hooked to pin (7) and on a tooth (1e) of the lever (1) with 
an almost elliptical through slot (1c) having a tooth (1b) 

along the edge; said lever (1) being fitted with an 
appendix (1f) interfering with the micro-switch (9) when 

the lever (1) translates forwards, thereby stopping the 
tape winding motor; 
a first cam (2) consisting of a fork frictioning lever 
fitted on pinion (4) of the clutch and having a tooth (2a) 

that presses continuously against an appendix (1a) of the 
oscillating lever (1) with sufficient force to rotate the 

same only when the latter (1) is free to oscillate; 
a second cam (3) consisting of a disk having a hooked 
prong (3a) along the perimeter, housed and rotating in a 

through slot (1c) of the lever (1); said cam (3) being 
keyed on the pin (5a) of an idle running wheel (5) engaging 

both with the drive wheel (6) whose pin (6a) winds the tape 
and with the driven gear (4a) keyed on the pinion (4) of 

the clutch; the combined and alternating action of cams (2 
and 3) occurring in such a way as to determine that while 

the first cam (2) performs timed thrusts on the oscillation 
lever (1), the hooked prong (3a) of the second cam (3) can 

not engage the tooth (1b) on the edge of the slot (1c). 
A tape recorder mechanism for stopping the tape 
winding motor at the end of the winding stage according to 

claim 1) consisting of: 
a cassette-ejection sliding block (10) that, when pressed, 

releases the hooking tooth (3a) of the corresponding 
holding tooth (1b) by interfering with the a
ppendix (1f) of 
the oscillating lever; said ejection sliding block (10), in 

interfering with appendix (1f), presses against the micro-switch 
(9), thereby taking the place of the appendix (1f).
