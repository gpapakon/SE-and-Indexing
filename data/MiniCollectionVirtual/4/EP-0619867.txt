<ABSTRACT>
In the method of the invention, an unknown mass fraction (F) of solid cryogen in a stored cryogenic refrigeration system is determined. The method includes the steps of adding mass (T) of a trace substance which is soluble in the liquid phase of the system. The total mass amount (M) of the cryogen in the system is determined at the time of charging the system. The initial mass concentration (CI) of the trace substance is determined by dividing (T) by (M). During operation of the stored cryogenic refrigeration system, a small sample of the liquid phase cryogen is extracted from the system. The sample is analyzed to determine the new concentration (CN) of the trace substance in the sample. The new concentration (CN) of the sample is dependent on the amount of solid cryogen which has been produced in the system. Thereafter, the mass fraction (F) of solid cryogen in the system is determined by solving the equation: F = 1 - (CI/CN).

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING THE SOLID FRACTION OF A STORED CRYOGENIC REFRIGERATION SYSTEMField of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for determining the solids content in a stored cryogenic refrigeration system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for determining the solids content in a stored cryogenic refrigeration system utilizing a trace substance which is soluble in the liquid phase of the system.Background of the Invention Stored cryogenic refrigeration systems are well known in the refrigeration industry. In general, these systems involve the use of a relatively large amount of refrigeration at cryogenic temperatures which is supplied on an intermittent basis by establishing a low temperature coolant reservoir of solid cryogen which can be economically created during a time period when there is low usage or the cost of electricity is lower. Buildup of refrigeration capacity in the reservoir can be accomplished relatively slowly, requiring fairly low power demands and relatively small capacity equipment. When the need for refrigeration arises, cold liquid cryogen is supplied at the necessary rate while taking advantage of the immediate availability of the capacity of the low temperature solid cryogen reservoir to remove the absorbed heat from a fluid stream returning to the reservoir. Such stored cryogenic refrigeration systems are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,224,801 and 4,127,008, both to Tyree, Jr.As indicated, stored cryogenic systems involve the use of mixtures of liquid and solid cryogen. The system generally consists of an insulated storage vessel containing a quantity of liquid cryogen, a gas compressor, and a liquid condenser. By using this 

 equipment in a closed cycle, mechanical refrigeration can be stored by the production and accumulation of solid cryogen in the storage vessel. This stored refrigeration is recovered by recirculating liquid cryogen from the storage vessel through an external thermal load by means of a heat exchanger. The heated liquid cryogen and any gases produced are returned to the storage vessel and cause the solid cryogen to melt. This concept of energy storage relies on the heat of fusion which is the amount of heat required to change a quantity of solid to its liquid phase.In such liquid-solid cryogen storage systems, it is highly desirable to be able to measure, on an intermittent or continuous basis, the solid fraction of the mixture which is a direct indication of the amount of
