<ABSTRACT>
A shaped multilayered product (1), in particular an internal liner for motor vehicles, has a supporting layer (2) of a substantially rigid film of a thermoplastic material and at least one surface covering (3, 4) of a textile sheet-like structure. The film (2) has perforations (7), at least on regions of the surface. These produce good damping of airborne sound.

centre to perforation centre, is approximately 0.5 to 3 cm, preferably 0.7

that the perforations (7) are deformed on shaped points of the sheet as a

function of the deformation of the sheet (2).
Laminate according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that perforations (7) are provided in those areas of the sheet (2), which

are intended to cover the cavities appropriate for sound absorption.
Laminate according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in

punching process.
Laminate according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that fibres of at least one surface layer (3, 4) are at least partly formed

from substantially the same type of thermoplastic material as the sheet (2)
and the surface layer (3, 4) is joined by the thermal bonding of said

fibres to the sheet (2).

surface layers (3, 4) are provided, which are preferably in each case connected

by thermal bonding to the sheet.

is made from essentially the same material as the sheet and in particular
polypropylene.
Laminate according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the sheet (2) and at least one surface layer (3, 4) is made from

thermoplastic polymers, which during the melting of the sheet, particularly
during reprocessing, are able to form a common melt.

a sheet web of a thermoplastic material is brought by surface heating to a

surface temperature in the tackiness range of the thermoplastic material

side is simultaneously thermostatically controlled and in particular cooled. 
Process according to one of the claims 17 to 22, characterized in that
