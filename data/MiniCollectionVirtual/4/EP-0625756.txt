<ABSTRACT>
A federated architecture and system are extensible and 
flexible for integrated access to heterogeneous DataBase 

Management Systems (DBMS) dispersed over a long haul network, 
allowing transparent access to a wide variety of DBMS while 

maintaining the local autonomy of the underlying DBMS. In 
addition, the system can run on top of different hardware, 

operating systems, network communications, and DBMS. The system 
can include new target DBMS with minimum changes and is not 

limited to integrate relational DBMS, but also to integrate 
legacy DBMS such as hierarchial or network DBMS, spatial 

information or text retrieval systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to an architecture
and method useful in computer data networks, and, more
particularly, to a federated (global) architecture and
system which are extensible end flexible for providing
users with transparent integrated access to heterogeneous
DataBase Management Systems (DBMS) dispersed over a long
haul network.During the past decade, large scale organizations and
environments have initially adopted heterogeneous and
incompatible information systems in an uncoordinated way;
independent of each other and without consideration that
one day they may need to be integrated. As a result,
information systems have become more and more complex, and
are characterized by several types of heterogeneity. For
example, different DataBase Management Systems (DBMS)
models may be used to represent data, such as the
hierarchical, network, and relational models. Aside from
databases, many software systems (such as spreadsheets,
multi-media databases and knowledge bases) store other
types of data, each with its own data model. Furthermore,
the same data may be seen by various users at different
levels of abstraction. Because of such differences, users
find it difficult to understand the meaning of all the
types of data presented to them. Analysts, operators and
current data processing technology are not able to
organize, process and intelligently analyze these diverse
and massive quantities of information. Their inefficiency
often results in late reports to decision makers, missed
intelligence opportunities and unexploited data.One of the needs is to access and manage existing and
new earth science data. The data is been collected and 
stored within a number of different DBMSs and image files
for the purpose of monitoring global earth processes. The
earth science data are collected by different information
systems including data concerning: climate, land, ocean,
etc., which are composed of relational databases, images,
and files. These systems were designed independently and
operate in completely different ways as to how the data are
stored and accessed. Moreover, they are tailored to
different hardware platforms. So, in order to access the
data, the users must learn how to access different systems.
This increases training costs and reduces user
productivity. In addition, the majority of users do not
have the level of computer science expertise necessary to
learn the different individual systems within a short
period of time, thus discouraging them from accessing
dispersed data, or in some
