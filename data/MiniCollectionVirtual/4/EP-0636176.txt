<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to nucleic acid sequences
encoding a human lymphocyte activation antigen termed HB15,
and to the proteins and polypeptides encoded by those
sequences.Many of the cell-surface molecules which regulate immune
responses contain conserved structural features similar to
those found in immunoglobulin (Ig). These molecules are
encoded by genes that are presumed to have evolved from a
common precursor and are therefore members of a large
superfamily (Williams et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol., 88:381-405
(1988)). Many of the Ig superfamily members are involved in
cell-cell adhesion and signal transduction. While most
members of this family contain multiple linearly-assembled
Ig-like domains, several proteins have been identified that
contain single Ig-like domains. Single Ig-like domain
proteins that are known or assumed to be involved in cell-cell
adhesion include: CD8α (Littman et al., Cell 40:237
(1985)), CD8β (Johnson et al., Nature 323:74 (1986)), CD7
(Aruffo et al., EMBO J. 6:3313 (1987)), Thy-1 (Williams et
al., Science 216:696 (1982)), CD28 (Aruffo et al., Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:8573 (1987)), CTLA-4 (Brunet et al.,
Nature 328:267 (1987)) and Po which is a structural protein
of the peripheral myelin sheath (Lemke et al., Cell 40:501
(1985)). In addition, others associate with the antigen
receptors of B and T lymphocytes forming multimeric signal-transducing
complexes including; CD3 γ, δ and ε chains (Gold 
et al., Nature 321:431-434 (1986); van den Elsen et al.,
Nature 312:413-418 (1984)), B29 (Hermanson et al., Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 85:6890 (1988)), and mB1 (Sakaguchi et
al., EMBO J. 7:3457-3464 (1988)).Two single Ig-like domain containing proteins found on
lymphocytes are preferentially associated with cellular
activation and are known to be involved in mediating cell-cell
interactions. CD28 is expressed much more on activated
than nonactivated T and B lymphocytes (Turka et al., J.
Immunol. 144:1646 (1990)), and CTLA-4 is expressed mostly,
if not exclusively, by activated T and B lymphocytes (Brunet
et al., Nature 328:267 (1987); Harper et al., J. Immunol.
147:1037-1044 (1991)). The role of CD28 as aT cell receptor
for the B7-molecule expressed by activated B cells has been
recently identified (Linsley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
USA 87:5031-503 (1990); Freeman et al., J. Immunol. 143:2714-2722
(1989)), as has a similar role for CTLA-4 (Linsley et
al., J. Exp. Med. 174:561-569 (1991)). As with CD28 and B7,
most of the Ig-like domain-containing receptors interact with
oth
