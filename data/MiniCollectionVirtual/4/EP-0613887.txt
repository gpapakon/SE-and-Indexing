<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to additive concentrates for use 
in preparing lubricating oil and fuel compositions. U.S. Patent No. 3,311,634 discloses 
7-Y-N-R₃-(R₄-5-norbornene)-2,3-dicarboximides and the corresponding 
norbornanes having the formulae 
wherein Y is a member selected from the group consisting of 
R₁ ,R₂- methylene 
R₁ ,R₂- spirooxirane 
R₁ ,R₂- methyl 
 
and R₁ ,R₂- methyl 
 
wherein the 7-carbon of the norbornene(ane) is further substituted  
with hydroxyl. Although none of the above formulae shows any group "R₄", at 
column 1, lines 40 to 45 it is stated:- "The R₃ substituents, other 
than hydrogen, are attached to the imide nitrogens by means of a 
single carbon-nitrogen bond and the R₄ substituents, when other 
than hydrogen, are attached to one or more of the available carbons 
on the ring nucleus.". R₁ and R₂ can be the same or different substituted or 
unsubstituted carbocyclic groups. R₁ and R₂ can further be 
heterocyclic groups containing from 4 to 5 carbon atoms interrupted 
by oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur linkages. R₂ can also be a 
saturated or unsaturated, substituted or unsubstituted, aliphatic 
group containing 1 to 7 carbon atoms. R₃ can be hydrogen, a lower alkyl, carbamoyl or 
hydroxyloweralkyl group, a heterocyclic group containing from 4 to 
5 carbon atoms interrupted by oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur linkages, 
or an aralkyl, aralkenyl, aryl, substituted aryl 
carbonylloweralkyl, aminoloweralkyl or loweralkylaminoloweralkyl 
group. R₄ can be any one or more of the substituents defined for R₁, 
R₂ and R₃ including hydrogen. R₄ can also be a lower alkenyl, 
lower alkynyl, cycloalkyl or cycloalkylloweralkyl group, optionally 
substituted with nitro, amino or hydroxyl groups or halogen atoms. 
It is stated at column 2, lines 25 to 28:- "Amino and hydroxyl 
substituents may be linked to the lower hydrocarbon group  
 
(represented by R₄) or they may be attached directly to the ring, 
i.e. they may be R₄.". R₄ may also be an oxygen atom attached 
through single bonds to each of the 5- and 6-positions of the 
norbornene-(ane) nucleus, i.e. an epoxy group. Although there are examples in the patent specification where 
one R₄ group is present, e.g. Examples XLVIII and LI, in each case 
the R₄ group is either an epoxy or hydroxyl group. In addition, 
the only Y groups exemplified contain at most a total of 14 carbon 
atoms, e.g. an o-methyldiphenylmethylene group as shown in Example 
XXXII. The compounds of the above formulae are said to be useful as 
intermediates in the
