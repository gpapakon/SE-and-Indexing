<ABSTRACT>
Hair care compositions are provided in which a silicone oil is dispersed in water by the action of a diquaternary polydimethylsiloxane. Polyvinylpyrrolidone may be included as a co-dispersant or stabilizer. The dispersed silicone oil combination is particularly useful in after-shampoo hair conditioner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is hair care 
compositions. More particularly, this invention relates 
to aqueous hair conditioning compositions containing 
silicone oil. In accordance with hair composition 
terminology, the term "silicone oil" is used herein to 
designate water-insoluble silicone polymers which are 
applied to hair to improve its feel or appearance. 
Silicone oils can provide the hair with a silky, 
lubricious feel. They can also provide a lusterization 
effect. These results are obtained by coating hair 
strands with thin films of silicone oil. Since silicone oils are substantially 
water-insoluble, after application to the hair they tend 
to remain thereon despite rinsing with water. Silicone 
oil can therefore be applied in a shampoo, or in a hair 
conditioner applied after shampooing, and then followed 
by water-rinsing. The two most common types of hair 
conditioning silicone oils are referred to in the 
International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary (CTFA) as 
"dimethicone" and "dimethiconol". Dimethicone is 
defined as a mixture of fully methylated linear siloxane 
polymers end blocked with trimethylsiloxy units. 
Dimethiconol is a dimethyl silicone polymer terminated 
with hydroxyl groups. Such hair conditioning silicone 
oils are relatively non-volatile liquids. Dimethicone 
and dimethiconol silicone oils are obtainable from 
commercial sources in the United States and other 
countries.  
 Since silicone oils have very limited 
solubility in aqueous products, they are usually applied 
in the form of aqueous emulsions or dispersions. For 
example, in a water-based shampoo or hair conditioner, 
the silicone oil may be dispersed with the aid of an 
emulsifying agent, and the dispersion or emulsion may be 
stabilized by the inclusion of thickeners. Cationic hair conditioning agents are also 
commonly used in hair treating compositions. Typically, 
cationic hair conditioning agents contain one or more 
cationic quaternary nitrogen groups, and one or more 
hydrophobic long chain aliphatic or silicone polymer. 
The cationic group can provide a degree of substantivity 
between the conditioning agent and hair. The long chain 
hydrophobic groups, which are derived from long chain 
fatty acids, or are silicone polymers, can provide hair 
conditioning functions. Silicone oils have been disclosed as 
ingredients of water-based shampoos which also contain a 
quaternary nitrogen-containing conditioning agent and an 
anionic surfactant. United States Patents 4,704,272, 
3,964,500, and 5,034,218 are
