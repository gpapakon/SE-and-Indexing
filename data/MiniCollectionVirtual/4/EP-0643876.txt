<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an em-wave antenna, particularly suitable for reception of DBS television signals. Known antennae are of the "dish" type and suffer from a number of problems such as size, wind-loading, lack of eye-appeal, expense of manufacture and difficulty of installation. The present invention, therefore, provides: a satellite antenna (5, 5d) comprising an elongate member in the form of a rod (10, 10d) and a horn (15, 15d), a first end (60, 60d) of the rod (10, 10d) being rigidly retained at or near a narrow end (61, 61d) of the horn (15, 15d), which end also provides connection means (65, 65d) for connecting the antenna (5, 5d) to receiving means, a second end (70, 70d) of the rod (10, 10d) extending outwardly of a wide end (75, 75d) of the horn (15, 15d), and wherein, in use, the second end (70, 70d) of the rod (10, 10d) is pointed substantially in the direction of the DBS satellite.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electromagnetic wave
antennae, and in particular to an antenna for receiving
electromagnetic signals from a satellite orbiting the
earth.There has been an upsurge in the past few years in
the availability of satellite television channels. This
is due to the launching of a number of DBS (Direct
Broadcast Satellites). These are a breed of high-powered
satellites which are specifically designed to beam
television signals direct to domestic and/or business
customers equipped with relatively small satellite
antennae - otherwise known as satellite dishes. These DBS
are positioned within the Clarke belt in a geostationary
orbit, i.e. they are positioned approximately 36000km
above the equator and travel in the same direction as the
earth's rotation in designated positions around the
equator. The result of this is that the satellite
effectively remains above the same point on the earth's
surface.A number of types of satellite dish antennae
presently exist, e.g. the prime-focus type, the offset
type and the flat plate type.Although most local authorities allow a householder
to erect one such dish up to 90cms in diameter without
planning permission, they are aesthetically displeasing to
the environment. Many householders are, therefore,
unhappy regarding installing such a dish, but have no
option if they wish to receive satellite television.The dishes are also awkward to install and expensive
to manufacture and consequently to purchase, and have in
some cases become a danger due to high wind-loading.EP-A-0330303 relates to an end fire aerial which comprises a solid block of dielectric
foam material which extends outwardly of a horn. The gain allegedly obtained from
this type of aerial is in the range of about 26.6B which results from increasing the
effective area of the aperture of the horn by mounting the dielectric block in the open
end of the horn.WO87/06066 describes a wideband horn antenna which comprises a dielectric rod
which is seated in the narrow end of a circular section horn. The free end of the rod
terminates adjacent the open end of the horn. The object of this antenna is to
produce a fixed beamwidth substantially independent of frequency over a wideband.US-A-2727233 describes a dielectric rod antenna which comprises a horn into which
is mounted a hollow elongate member which is formed from four dielectric rods, one
mounted at each corner of the horn. Each rod is connected to the two adjacent rods
by a sheet of dielectric material. It is an object of this antenna to provide
