<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for hydroxyalkylating aldoximes and ketoximes by reacting these oximes with unsubstituted or substituted ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate in the presence of a catalyst, which process comprises the use of catalytic quantities of an N-alkylated, stable, organic amidine base or of pyridine which is substituted by a secondary amine. The compounds are important intermediates for herbicidally active compounds.
