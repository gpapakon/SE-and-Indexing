Process for reducing the concentration of 
nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gas of combustion engines 

or incinerators, in which an ammonia-containing reducing 
agent is added to the exhaust gas and in which nitrogen 

oxides are converted to nitrogen and water in a catalyst 
unit (2) with exhaust gas flowing through it, characterized 

in 

that a first sensor element (12) which reacts 
both to nitrogen monoxide and to ammonia with an 

increase in conductivity is disposed in the 
exhaust gas stream downstream of the catalyst 

unit (2), 
that the resistance dependent on the nitrogen 
monoxide concentration and ammonia concentration 

or the electrical conductivity of the sensor 
element (12) is measured, and 
that an amount of reducing agent is added to the 
exhaust gas which is such that the electrical 

resistance of the sensor element (12) is a maximum 
or the electrical conductivity is a minimum. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that gaseous ammonia, ammonia in aqueous solution or urea 

is added to the exhaust gas as reducing agent. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the electrical resistance or the electrical 

conductivity is measured of a sensor element (12) composed 
of a metal oxide/vanadium oxide mixture. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the electrical resistance or the electrical conductivity 

is measured of a sensor element (12) composed  
 

of an aluminium oxide/vanadium oxide mixture or an iron 
oxide/vanadium oxide mixture. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the electrical resistance or the 

electrical conductivity is measured of a sensor element 
(12) composed of a vanadate MeVO
4
, where Me denotes a 
trivalent metal. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the electrical resistance or the electrical conductivity 

is measured of a sensor element (12) composed 
of aluminium vanadate or iron vanadate. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that a sensor element (12) is used which 

has a layer-type structure and is contacted by an electrode 
pair (11, 11'). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the sensor element (12) is actively 

heated and kept at a constant temperature. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that a second sensor element corresponding 

to the first sensor element (12) is disposed in 
the exhaust gas stream upstream of the catalyst unit (2) 

and is used to measure the nitrogen monoxide concentration.
