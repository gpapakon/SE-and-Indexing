<ABSTRACT>
Measurement of the caliper of a borehole, and/or 
of the standoff of a drilling tool from the walls of a 

borehole, during a drilling operation is made using an 
apparatus which includes three or more sensors (48), such as 

acoustic transducers, arranged circumferentially around a 
downhole tool (30) or drill collar. The transducers 

transmit ultrasonic signals to the borehole wall through the 
drilling fluid surrounding the drillstring and receive 

reflected signals back from the wall. Travel times for 
these signals are used to calculate standoff data for each 

transducer. The standoff measurements may be used to 
calculate the caliper of the borehole, the eccentricity of 

the tool in the borehole, and the angle of eccentricity with 
respect to the transducer position. The eccentricity and 

angle computations may be used to detect unusual movements 
of the drillstring in the borehole, such as sticking. 

banging, and whirling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
apparatus and method for measuring dimensions in a borehole
and, but not exclusively, to an apparatus and method for
acoustically measuring the caliper of a borehole, and the
standoff of a drilling assembly from a borehole wall during
a drilling operation.Modern petroleum drilling and production
operations require a great deal of information relating to
underground conditions. Such information typically
includes characteristics of the earth formations traversed
by a well, in addition to data on the size and configuration
of the borehole itself. Among the characteristics of the
earth formation of interest to drillers are the porosity and
density of the rock or strata surrounding the borehole.
However, the processes often employed to measure these
characteristics are subject to important errors unless
information on the borehole size and configuration is also
taken into account in their determination.The collection of information on downhole
conditions, often referred to as "logging" in the art, may
be accomplished in several ways. A sonde, or probing tool,
often having a number of detecting and sensing devices for
measuring various downhole parameters, may be lowered into
the borehole on the end of a cable, or wireline. The cable
serves to control the position of the sonde and conveys 
information collected by the detectors and sensors to the
surface where the data can be evaluated. Such wireline
techniques may be used for measuring the caliper of a
borehole by incorporating mechanical calipers in a sonde.
The calipers extend out from the sonde and contact the wall
of the borehole to measure its dimensions. It is also known
to incorporate acoustic devices in a wireline sonde for
measuring the caliper of the borehole.While wireline logging is useful in collecting
information on underground formations, it has a number of
drawbacks. In order to insert the sonde in the borehole,
the drillstring must be removed, resulting in considerable
cost and downtime for the driller. In addition, such
techniques do not afford data collection during the drilling
operation. Moreover, mechanical calipers may scratch or
damage the borehole or well casing, and are not suitable for
obtaining measurements during the drilling process.In recent years increasing emphasis has been placed on
the collection of data on downhole conditions during the
drilling process. In addition to information on weight on
bit, torque on bit, and direction of drilling, such
information typically includes
