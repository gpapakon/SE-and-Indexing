<ABSTRACT>
Producing edible gas hydrate by combining an aqueous liquid and a hydrate forming gas in a condensed state at a pressure above the minimum hydrate forming pressure but at a temperature above the maximum hydrate formation temperature, thereafter contacting the liquid with a surface having a temperature below said maximum temperature and moving the liquid with respect to said surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the manufacture of edible 
clathrates and more precisely the manufacture of solid gas 
hydrates. Various methods for manufacturing clathrates are known in 
the art, for example from US-A-4 347 707, US-A-4 487 023 
and US-A-3 217 503, but these methods all require a careful 
control of the reaction conditions and, what is more 
important, complicated and expensive equipment. Moreover 
the composition of the final product cannot easily be 
controlled, in particular not for the higher gas contents. The invention remedies these problems by providing a method 
requiring only the simplest of pressure vessels and by 
utilisation of commonly existing freezing facilities. To 
that end, the invention provides a method according to the 
main claim. DE 594562 (Geppert) discloses a method for the production 
of solid carbon dioxide hydrates under pressures equal to 
or greater than the dissociation tension at the temperature 
of production from a mixture of carbon dioxide and water. 
The mixture is kept circulating by means of a pump, the 
stream of liquid directed downwards in the mixing vessel 
depositing the solid carbon dioxide hydrate that is formed 
as a dense mass on a screen or filter. US 3,220,204 (Adler) relates to a process of producing 
carbonated ice using a cooled votator. The process is 
continuous and is operated to form a slush of small hydrate 
crystals. The resulting slush is then passed to another 
vessel, whilst kept under pressure, and reduced in 
temperature so the free aqueous liquid freezes to form 
water ice. The stability of the hydrate crystals follows 
from their encapsulation in water ice. US 3 220 204 thus  
 
teaches the production of a two phase product produced by 
a continuous process using two stages. In method according to the present invention preferably mixtures of the clathrate forming 
species are used, in the condensed and in particular in the 
liquid state and for obtaining the highest gas contents in 
approximately the ratio prescribed by the stoichiometric 
formula for the clathrates being prepared, eg 5.75H2O.CO2 
for CO2 gas hydrate. In practice this means that the liquid 
having the gas dissolved therein is in equilibrium with 
liquified gas. For obtaining high activity gas hydrates 
preferably a stoichiometric amount + or - 50% and more 
preferred + or - 10% is used. To prevent gas losses during 
manufacture in practice gas amounts ranging between below 
and up to stoichiometric amounts are used. Suitable temperature and pressure conditions

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing an edible gas hydrate which 
comprises combining an aqueous liquid, including pure 

water, and an edible gas hydrate-forming gas at a pressure 
sufficiently high to form a gas hydrate, but at a 

temperature preventing this, and thereafter reducing the 
temperature to form the solid gas hydrate, wherein the 

aqueous liquid as a continuous phase having the gas 
dissolved therein, is contacted with a surface which is at 

a temperature sufficiently low to form the solid gas 
hydrate while maintaining the liquid in movement with 

respect to the said surface characterised in that a thin 
film is formed from which the hydrate builds up 

progressively. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that the 
liquid having the gas dissolved therein is in equilibrium 

with liquified gas. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
aqueous liquid and the gas in a condensed condition are put 

in a vessel and pressurised, the wall of the vessel is 
cooled to below the temperature at which the solid gas 

hydrate is formed and the liquid and vessel wall are made 
to move with respect to each other. 
The method of claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that 
an amount of an aqueous liquid and about a stoichiometric 

amount of the hydrate-forming gas are arranged in a 
pressure vessel, which is closed, the vessel is kept at a 

temperature above the maximum clathrate forming 
temperature, and thereafter the temperature of the vessel 

is reduced to below the temperature at which the solid gas 
hydrate is formed, the amount of gas and the capacity of 

the vessel being such that a pressure is obtained 
sufficient for clathrate forming.  

 
The method of claim 4, characterized in that a 
stoichiometric amount + or - 50% and preferably + or -10% 

is used. 
The method of claim 4 or 5, characterized in that gas 
amounts ranging between below and up to stoichiometric 

amounts are used. 
The method of any previous claim which is effected in 
a mainly cylindrical vessel. 
The method according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the vessel has a length to diameter ratio of at least 5:1 

and preferably of at least 10:1. 
The method according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in 
that the vessel is rotated about its longitudinal axis and 

in a horizontal position.
