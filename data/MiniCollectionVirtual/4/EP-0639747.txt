<ABSTRACT>
The workpiece (22) is subjected to the drying process with a commencement temp. of at least approximately 45 deg. C., during the blowing with air jets is rotated, and in the chamber (10) during an evapn. period is subjected for between at least 8 seconds and at most 30 seconds to a vacuum. The air pressure in the chamber, starting from atmospheric pressure, during the total evapn. period is lowered at least continually to a min. value of approximately 4 mbar to approximately 0.5 mbar. The air for prodn. of the air jets is at least partly fed in a circuit (10,30,34,36) contg. a blower (36) and outside the chamber is at least partly dehumidified by cooling and droplet sepn.. The air during the evapn. period is fed in circulation via a by-pass (40) bridging over the chamber, and is thereby dehumidified.

Process for drying a single workpiece which has been 
cleaned with an aqueous cleaning fluid after machining 

and has surface areas with contours retaining cleaning 
fluid, in at least one chamber, wherein the workpiece is 

acted upon with jets of air to remove and distribute 
cleaning fluid, and the chamber is then evacuated to 

evaporate residual cleaning fluid, 
characterized in that
 
the workpiece (22; 22') is subjected at an initial 

temperature of at least approximately 45Â° C to the drying 
process, is turned while it is being blown with jets of 

air and is exposed to a vacuum in the chamber (10'; 10") 
for an evaporation period of at least 8 seconds and at 

the most 30 seconds, and in that the air pressure in the 
chamber (10'; 10") - starting from atmospheric pressure - 

is lowered during the entire evaporation period at least 
essentially continuously to a minimum value of from 

approximately 4 mbar to approximately 0.5 mbar. 
Process as defined in claim 1, characterized in that the 
air pressure in the chamber is lowered during the 

evaporation period to a minimum value of approximately 
3 mbar. 
Process as defined in claim 1, characterized in that the 
air pressure in the chamber is lowered during the 

evaporation period to a minimum value of approximately 
2 mbar.  

 
Process as defined in any one or several of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the evaporation period lasts 

approximately 15 seconds. 
Process as defined in any one or several of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the workpiece (22; 22') is 

arranged in a chamber (10; 10') while it is being blown 
with jets of air, and in that the air for generating the 

jets of air is at least partially circulated in a circuit 
(10, 30, 34, 36; 10', 34', 36', 30') comprising a fan 

(36; 36') and is at least partially dehumidified outside 
the chamber. 
Process as defined in claim 5, characterized in that the 
air is dehumidified by cooling-down. 
Process as defined in claim 5 or 6, characterized in that 
the air is dehumidified by means of a droplet separator 

(34; 34'). 
Process as defined in any one or several of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the workpiece (22) is blown with 

the jets of air in the chamber (10) to be evacuated. 
Process as defined in claims 5 and 8, characterized in 
that during the evaporation period the air is circulated 

in a circuit via a by-pass (40) bridging the chamber (10) 
and is dehumidified while circulating. 
Process as defined in any one or several of claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that the air for generating the jets 

of air is heated.  
 
Process as defined in any one or several of claims 1 to 

10, characterized in that the chamber (10; 10") to be 
evacuated is heated. 
Apparatus for carrying out the process as defined in any 
one or several of the preceding claims comprising a 

chamber (10; 10') for receiving the workpiece (22; 22') 
in which blow nozzles (26; 26') are arranged for blowing 

the workpiece, characterized by an air circuit (10, 34, 
36, 30; 10', 34', 36', 30') comprising the chamber (10; 

10'), the nozzles (26; 26') thereof, at least one fan 
(36; 36') and an air dehumidifier (34; 34'), and by a 

rotationally driveable workpiece carrier (20; 20') 
rotatably mounted in the chamber. 
Apparatus as defined in claim 12, characterized in that 
the air dehumidifier (34; 34') comprises a droplet 

separator. 
Apparatus as defined in claim 12 or 13, characterized in 
that the air dehumidifier (34; 34') comprises an air 

cooler. 
Apparatus as defined in any one or several of claims 12 
to 14, characterized by air circuit valves (32, 38) 

separating the chamber (10) from the air circuit, and by 
a vacuum pump (48) connectable via a valve (50) to the 

chamber (10). 
Apparatus as defined in claim 15, characterized by a by-pass 
line (40) which is arranged between the air circuit 

valves (32, 38), on the one hand, and fan (36) and air 
dehumidifier (34), on the other hand, and contains a 

shut-off valve (42).
