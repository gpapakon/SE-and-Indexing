<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides mutant neurotrophic factors
of the nerve growth factor family which have modified receptor
binding affinity and biological specificity. It is based, in part, on
the development of a model system which is useful for the
rational design of analogues and chimeras of neurotrophic
factors.The control of cell growth and differentiation requires
specific factors which exert their effects via interaction with
receptors on the surface of responsive cells. Despite the
increasing number of growth and differentiation factors that have
been discovered and characterized, the precise structures
involved in binding and biological activity and the sequential and
causal molecular events underlying the activation of multiple
receptors are largely unknown.Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a 118 amino acid polypeptide
which controls the survival, development and differentiation of
the sympathetic nervous system, as well as parts of the sensory
and central nervous systems (Levi-Montalcini and Angeletti,
1968; Thoenen and Barde, 1980; Whittemore and Seiger, 1987; 
Thoenen et al., 1987). The biologically active form of NGF is a
dimer of identical subunits each of which is produced from a
precursor molecule (Angeletti and Bradshaw, 1971; Angeletti et
al., 1973). A cDNA clone for NGF was first isolated in the mouse
(Scott et al., 1983). Subsequently, the NGF gene has been
characterized in a number of other species including several
mammals, birds, reptiles and fishes (Schwarz et al., 1989;
Hallböök et al., 1991).NGF belongs to a family of structurally and functionally
related molecules, collectively known as neurotrophins of the
nerve growth factor family, which includes at least three other
members, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Barde et al.,
1982; Leibrock et al., 1989), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) (Hohn et al.,
1990; Maisonpierre et al., 1990; Rosenthal et al., 1990; Ernfors
et al., 1990) and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) (Hallböök et al., 1991; Ip
et al., 1992).NGF interacts with a low-affinity receptor expressed on a
variety of cell types of both neuronal and non-neuronal origin
(Emfors et al., 1988; Yan and Johnson, 1988; Heuer et al., 1990;
Hallböök et al., 1990). The other three neurotrophins of the nerve
growth factor family can also bind to the low-affinity NGF
receptor (Rodriguez-Tébar et al., 1990; Ernfors et al., 1990;
Squinto et al., 1991; Hallböök et al., 1991). This receptor is
represented by a transmembrane glycoprotein of approximately
75,000 daltons (p75NGFR) which binds NGF with a Kd

<CLAIMS>
A mutant neurotrophic factor, said factor comprising a
wild-type neurotrophic factor wherein the only

modification in the sequence of the factor is the
replacement of one or more positively charged amino

acids in amino acids 30 through 34 or amino acids 93
through 98 and wherein said modification reduces the

ability of the mutant neurotrophic factor to bind
p75
NGFR
 as compared to the wild-type neurotrophic
factor, but the mutant neurotrophic factor maintains

the ability to bind to a tyrosine kinase (trk)
receptor.
