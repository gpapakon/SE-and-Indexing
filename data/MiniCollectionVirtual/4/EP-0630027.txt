<ABSTRACT>
Method and memory card (1) for making secure the writing of sensitive data into the EEPROM data storage memory (2) of the card, consisting, during each write, in performing the following operations in succession:   a) register the start address of the data area (Ze) of the card to which a write is to be performed, in an address field (Za) of the memory;   b) read the data present in this data area (Ze) of the memory;   c) store the data read in a save area (Zs) of the memory; d) write the "WRITING IN PROGRESS" datum to a flag area (Zd) of the memory;   e) perform the write to the data area (Ze) of the memory; and f) write the "NO WRITING IN PROGRESS" datum to the flag area (Zd) of the memory.

<CLAIMS>
A method of securing the writing of sensitive data in the EEPROM data
storage memory (2) of a memory card (1), the method being characterized in

that it consists, during each write, in performing the following operations in
succession:


a) writing, in an address field (Ze) of the memory, the starting address
of the card data zone (Ze) in which a write is to be performed;
b) reading the data present in said data zone (Ze) of the memory;
c) storing the data ace read in a backup zone (Zs) of the memory;
d) writing a "WRITING IN PROGRESS" data item in a flag zone (Zd) of
the memory;
e) writing in the data zone (Ze) of the memory; and
f) writing a "WRITING NOT IN PROGRESS" data item in the flag zone
(Zd) of the memory.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that, on each occasion that
the memory card is powered up, the method consists in performing the

following operations:

a) reading the "FLAG" data item in the flag zone (Zd) of the memory
and proceeding normally with the card operating program in the event that

said data item is equal to "WRITING NOT IN PROGRESS"; and
b) if the "FLAG" data item is equal to "WRITING IN PROGRESS":

copying the data stored in the backup zone (Zs) of the memory
into the data zone (Ze), starting from the address specified in the address

zone (Za), and then
writing the "WRITING NOT IN PROGRESS" data item in the
flag zone (Zd) of the memory.
A memory card for implementing the method of claim 1 or 2, the card being
characterized in that the following are provided in the EEPROM data storage

memory thereof:

a data zone (Ze) in which writing takes place;
an address field (Za) for having the starting address of said writing
recorded therein;
a backup zone (Zs) for temporarily storing therein data that has
already been written; and 
a flag zone (Zd) for having written therein either the data item
"WRITING IN PROGRESS" or the data item "WRITING NOT IN

PROGRESS".
