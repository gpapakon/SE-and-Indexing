<ABSTRACT>
2.1 In securing data traffic in known systems of this type, discrepancies occur between optimum protection against unauthorised intervention, even of an internal nature, on the one hand and hindrances to use, e.g. storage problems and the protection of personal data, on the other hand. 2.2 In the method according to the invention, a mutually exclusive division of the scopes of authorisation is carried out, in which one type a) relates to the operating system and to the guaranteeing of availability and reliability, and a second type b) serves to prevent and identify unauthorised intervention and to collect associated operator data. For this purpose, two separate databases with different methods of access are formed and a session number is set up as an aid to data integration. 2.3 The invention is suitable for all types of security management systems in distributed and complex data transmission, telecommunications and data processing systems, even for commercial payment transactions.

<CLAIMS>
Method to secure data traffic in complex telecommunication 
and data systems, where operators possess and verify 

differentiated scopes of authorization to the functions of the 
operational and security systems and where the operator's identity, 

the time of access and an identifier of the function used are 
recorded, 
characterized by the fact
 that a 
mutually exclusive division of the authorization scopes is made 

into 

a) those which apply to the operating system and the security components 
serving the purpose of ensuring availability and 

reliability, on the one hand, and 
b) such ones applying exlusively to those components of the 
security system which are used to prevent and detect abusive 

interventions or manipulations and to identify the associated 
operator data, on the other hand, 
 
and that recordings take place in two separate databases, 

the first of which contains 

aa) only a functional identity, the time of data traffic and an 
allocated session number and can be read exclusively with 

the authorization scope referred to under a), and the second of 
which contains 
bb) only operator identities in connection with allocated session 
numbers and is readable exclusively with the authorization 

scope referred to under b). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact that, 
in the definition of authorization scope and type of operators, 

use is made of chip cards being hardware-protected against readout, 
which contain a read-out capable certificate, at least for the 

operator's identity and his/her public, personalized key and 
identifiers of the issuing unit and a secret, read-out incapable 

operator key and the session-specific operator's authentication 
vis Ã  vis the system.
