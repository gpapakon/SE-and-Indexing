a development container for containing a developer (4); 

a magnet (1b) stationarily located in the development 
container (7) and having magnetic poles radially 

provided on a plurality of points; a rotational

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic 
brush developing apparatus for developing an electrostatic 
latent image, which is used in an electrophotographic 
recording apparatus or the like. Widely known as a developing method applicable 
to a developing apparatus is a two-component magnetic 
brush developing method using a toner or a colored 
powder, and a carrier or a magnetic powder as a 
developer. The carrier used therein imparts an electrostatic 
charge to the toner through a 
triboelectrification or the like thereof, and the toner 
is held by the electrostatic force for conveyance. Also, the developing roller functions to 
convey the developer to the developing section and holds 
the carrier by the magnetic force for conveyance, and 
thus the magnetic properties of the developing roller 
have a great influence on the image quality. The principle of the two-component magnetic 
brush developing method relevant to the present 
invention, will now be described with reference to 
Fig. 18. A developing roller 1 is constituted of a 
magnet 1b having a plurality of magnetic poles, and a 
rotational sleeve 1a which rotatably covers the surface 
of the magnet 1b. The magnet 1b is usually fixed, and a 
developer 4 is caught on the surface of the rotational 
sleeve 1a, through the magnetic force exerted by the 
magnet 1b, and carried to a developing section 9 in 
which a photosensitive drum 3 confronts the developing 
roller 1a, through the rotation of the rotational  
 
sleeve 1a. The developer restriction member 2, i.e., a 
blade is arranged opposite to the developing roller 1 
(rotational sleeve 1a) to restrict the amount of the 
developer 4 to be carried to the developing section 9. The amount of the developer 4 passing through 
the developer restriction member 2 is determined by the 
interval (a blade gap) between the developing roller 1 
and the developer restriction member 2, and the amount 
by which the developer head has been raised. Accordingly, 
the amount of the developer 4 which has passed 
through the developer restriction member 2 is determined 
by the height of the developer head. The developer head is the 
height of the developer brush carried on the surface of the sleeve 1a. The image quality is also influenced by the height of 
the developer head. Namely if the height of the developer is 
comparatively low and the amount of the developer to be carried to 
the developing section 9 is thus reduced, sufficient toner for a 
development is not supplied, which results in a deterioration of 
the
