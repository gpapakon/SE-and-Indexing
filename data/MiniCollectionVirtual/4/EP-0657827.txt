<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus are provided for converting a first document to a second 
document. The first document is in a first extended attribute grammar, while the second 

document is in a second extended attribute grammar. Determining means (22,24) determine 
the first and second extended attribute grammars. An extended attribute coupling grammar, 

determined by means (26), couples the first and second extended attribute grammars. The first 
document is converted to a first tree, by generating means (30), which is partially copied to a 

first copy. The first copy is completed by evaluating it's attribute with respect to the extended 
attribute coupling grammar. The first copy is then a partially attributed tree of the second 

document. The partially attributed tree is completed to form a second tree based on the 
second extended attribute grammar. The second tree is then converted to the second 

document.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for
transforming an attributed tree valid under an attribute
grammar to another attributed tree valid under another
attribute grammar.Some of the expected (but only partially realized)
benefits of electronic documents over paper documents
include enhanced document processing capabilities and
easier manipulation of documents, such as creation,
editing, updating, storage, access, and delivery of
documents. A key enabler for such enhancement in known
systems is their ability to represent not only the contents
of documents but also various meta-information about the
contents. For instance, document structures such as
chapter, section, and paragraph breaks can be explicitly
represented for enhanced browsing, retrieval, and component
reuse.However, one central technical problem involves how to
represent such meta-information in a way computers and
humans can easily manipulate. Once prominent approach to
this problem is to adapt formal grammars (used to describe
programming languages) to represent hierarchical structures
of documents (e.g., chapter, section, and paragraph
breaks). The Standard Generalized Markup Languages (SGML),
for instance, uses an extension of context-free grammars
for this purpose.Document EP-A-447157 relates to a data format
conversion system for converting a document according to
Open Document Architecture to a document according to
Compound Document Architecture. This conversion system
comprises profile conversion components that convert the
logical or layout structures of the source document to
those of the target format, content architecture conversion
components that convert the contents of the source document
to the target format and a main converter component that 
identifies the profile to which the compound document
conforms, the main converter component invoking the
required profile conversion component and the profile
conversion component invoking the content architecture
conversion components.This invention addresses two insufficiencies in the
existing grammar-based approaches to representing and
manipulating electronic documents. First, these approaches
have only a limited capability to specifying attributes and
their dependencies. For example, an attribute of "section"
may depend on certain attributes of "chapter". Second,
these approaches have an inadequate ability to specify and
compute document transformation. That is, they are unable
to fully transform document instances as derivation trees
of one grammar to document

<CLAIMS>
A method for converting a first document to a second document, the method
including:


specifying the class of a first document as an extended attribute grammar, where
the first document is represented by a first tree generated from the first extended attribute

grammar (S10);
specifying the class of a second document as an extended attribute grammar,
where the second document is represented by a second tree generated from the second extended

attribute grammar;
specifying an extended attribute coupling grammar between the first extended
attribute grammar and the second extended attribute grammar;
partially transforming the first document to the second document according to the
extended attribute coupling grammar between the first extended attribute grammar and the

second extended attribute grammar (S20); and
evaluating the remaining attributes of the first extended attribute grammar in
terms of the second extended attribute grammar (S30).
A method according to claim 1, where the extended attribute grammars comprise
logical and non-logical attributes, the non-logical attributes comprising imported, inherited and

synthesized attributes.
A method according to claim 2, wherein the step of partially transforming
comprises:


copying a first source tree of the first document generated from a first extended
grammar into a second source tree, 
keeping only those imported attributes of the extended coupling.
A method according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the step of evaluating comprises:

   evaluating the inherited and synthesized attributes of the second source tree in
terms of the extended attribute coupling to produce a partially attributed tree for the second

extended attribute grammar.
A method according to any one of claims 2 to 4, wherein the step of evaluating
comprises:


generating a first copy of the first tree of the first document, wherein only
imported attributes of the extended attribute coupling grammar are copied with the first copy;
evaluating remaining attributes of the first copy based on the extended attribute
coupling grammar;
producing a partially attributed tree of the second document based on the step of
evaluating remaining attributes of the first copy;
evaluating remaining attributes of the partial attributed tree based on the second
extended attribute grammar generating a second tree of the second document based on the step of

evaluating remaining attributes of the first copy.

remaining attributes of the partially attributed tree with respect to the second extended attribute
grammar, the partially attributed tree corresponding to the first tree partially transformed to the

second tree.
