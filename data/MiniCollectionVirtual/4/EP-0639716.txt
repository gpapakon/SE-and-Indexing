<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for pump stations comprising two or 
more pump units (4), (5). The pressure pipes (8), (9) from the pump 

units are connected via a shunt lead (10) which is kept open during 
short intervals at pump starts, thus obtaining a backward flow 

through the pump(s) which not operate at the moment, thereby flashing 
out pollutions through the inlet(s) of said pump(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
A Device to diminish the risk for clogging of pumps for sewage water 
and other liquids containing contaminations. The invention concerns a device to diminish the risk for clogging of 
the hydraulic parts in pump stations for sewage water and other 
heavily polluted liquids. A pump station for sewage water comprises a tank with inlets and 
outlets, that latter(s) from one or several pumps. The sewage water 
always contains a lot of pollutions such as sludge and elongated 
objects such as rags which easily clog pumps and pipes. In order to 
diminish this risk the hydraulic parts of the pumps are designed with 
large throughlets and the inlets sometimes being provided with cutting 
means which cut the elongated objects into pieces. An example 
is shown in the Swedish Patent No 820 5774-6. In order to diminish the risk for sludge banks being built up in the 
pump station it is known practice to arrange special mixers or valves 
which during certain periods obtain an agitation of the water. An 
example is shown in the Swedish Patent No 8900597-9. Another method which is used to take away elongated objects from the 
pump inlet is to operate the pump in reverse a short time before each 
pump start. In this way rags being stuck to the impeller may be 
flushed away. According to the invention is obtained a simple and reliable solution 
to the above mentioned problems by help of a special shunt lead which 
is stated in the claims. The invention is described more closely below with reference to the 
enclosed drawing. Here 1 stands for a pump station with inlet 2 and 
outlet 3 for sewage water. 4 and 5 stand for submersible pumps with 
inlet 6 and 7 respectively and pressure pipes 8 and 9 respectively 
10 stands for a shunt lead having a valve arrangement 11. 12 and 13 
finally stand for non-return valves.  The device according to the invention operates in the following way. When the water level in the pump station has risen so much that 
pumping shall begin, one of the pumps 4 starts to transport the water 
to the outlet 3. During the initial period of the pumping, some 
seconds, the valve 11 in the shunt lead is open. This means that a 
part of the pumped water goes through the shunt lead, downwards 
through the pressure pipe 9, backwards through the pump 5 and out 
through its inlet 7. The flow is very strong which means that rags 
etc being stuck within the pump will be flushed out. The flow will 
rotate the impeller backwards making objects being wound around the 
impeller to unwind which makes the cleaning

<CLAIMS>
1 A device to diminish the risk for clogging of the hydraulic 
parts in pumps arranged in a pump station comprising at 

least two pump units (4), (5) characterized in that it 
comprises a shunt lead (10) between the outlet pipes (8), 

(9) from the two pumps (4), (5), the shunt lead being provided 
with a valve arrangement (11) which keeps the shunt 

lead open under a certain period when one of the pump starts 
and at least one of the other pumps does not operate, thus 

obtaining that a part of the flow from the operating pump 
(4) goes backwards through the non-operating pump (5), 

thereby flushing pollutions in its hydraulic part through 
its inlet (7). 
2 A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
valve (11) is time controlled. 
3 A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
valve (11) is controlled by the flow.
