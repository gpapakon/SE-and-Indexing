<ABSTRACT>
A variable optical delay line which can delay an optical signal by a 
selected interval of time comprises an input wavelength router (12) connected to an 

output wavelength router (22) by means of optical waveguides (18
l
-18
N
) of 
different lengths. A wavelength shifter (13) coupled to the input of the input 

wavelength router shifts the wavelength of the received signal to a desired 
wavelength. Depending on the wavelength of the signal from the wavelength shifter, 

the received signal is directed to a specific one of the waveguides of different lengths 
to provide a delay which is controllable. The output wavelength router directs the 

optical signals from the various waveguides of different lengths to a common output 
waveguide (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical communications system. More
particularly, this invention relates to optical delay lines which are variable and can
be used in optical communications systems.Present day commercial lightwave systems use optical fibers to carry
large amounts of multiplexed information over long distances from one location to
another. Many transmission lines such as inter-office and intra-office links, local
area networks (LAN) and metropolitan area networks (MAN) are optical and,
therefore, the information that is being transmitted is carried over an optical fiber. A
major advantage of transmitting information in optical form is the very large
bandwidth and low losses associated with single mode optical fiber.In a communication network, it is normally required that signals from
many transmission lines be cross-connected or switched to other transmission lines
to provide flexibility and to permit traffic from one transmission line to be rerouted
to different destinations.Various architectures that are being investigated for use in photonic
switching in the time domain involve either fiber-loop or fiber-delay-line optical
buffering. In an article in OFC/100C'93 Technical Digest by P. Gavignet-Morin et
al., there is disclosed a high-capacity optical buffer based on a set of fiber delay lines
that realize in the photonic domain the equivalent of an electronic multibuffer shift
register with variable delays for packet storage and time-switching applications in
broad-band optical networks.Until now, there has been no convenient approach to providing an
optical delay line which can provide a variable delay and is economical to
implement.US-A-4 671 604 discloses a wavelength dependent, tunable, optical time delay
system for electrical signals having a conversion/tuning unit for converting an incoming
electrical signal into an optical signal as well as selectively varying the wavelength of
the optical signal; a single-mode, high dispersion optical fiber for receiving the optical
signal and through which the optical signal propagates at a speed dependent upon its
wavelength; and a detector-converter for converting the optical signal back to an
electrical signal.In accordance with this invention, a variable optical delay line has been
developed. The variable delay line in accordance with this invention may be based
upon photonic integrated circuitry which can provide a large range of time delay to
an optical signal, and this can be realized at a relatively low cost.In one example of the invention,
