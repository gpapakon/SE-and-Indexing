<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a novel raster output scanner (ROS) configuration that employs 
modulated laser diodes (50) as the light source. Each laser diode is coupled to a dedicated
 
driver (52) that modulates the light beam according to digital video signal data. The present 

invention employs a single-channel acoustic-optic cell (58) that deflects the multiple beams to 
maintain proper facet tracking. A single transducer (57) is coupled to the single-channel 

acoustic-optic cell that generates the necessary acoustic wave to maintain proper tracking.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to raster optical scanning (ROS) and, in
particular, to xerographic systems employing a facet tracked ROS architecture.Xerographic printing employing raster output scanners (ROS) has evolved along the
lines of greater efficiency, higher data throughput rates, improved print quality, lower cost of
manufacture, and smaller packaging. These metrics of improved xerographic printing are
influenced by various factors. The goal of designing a ROS system is to choose some
combination of factors that produces a system that optimizes these metrics.
Efficiency of a ROS system has, in general, two major components: power throughput
efficiency and scanning efficiency. Power throughput efficiency is defined as the ratio of the
power output of the laser to the power of the beam received at the photoreceptor, as
calculated in a "non-dynamic" mode (i.e. no polygon movement). Primarily, power
throughput efficiency is a function of the type of illumination the facet receives and of optical
element surface losses.Optical element surface loss is due to undesirable absorption, reflection, and
transmission in the various optical elements. While these factors can be controlled to some
extent, there comes a point at which no further efficiencies may be achieved at the optical
element level. Instead, there are certain system design choices that can be made with the goal
of maximizing scanning efficiency.Three methods of polygon facet illumination are currently practiced in ROS systems:
over-filled, under-filled, and facet tracked. As regards efficiency, facet tracking has certain
advantages over the other two designs. For example, facet tracking avoids the power
throughput loss of over-filled scanning while nearly adopting its perfect scanning efficiency.
Likewise, facet tracking avoids the scanning inefficiencies of under-filled scanning while
adopting its high power throughput. Thus, facet tracking is generally a better choice of
scanning techniques when designing an optimally efficient system.
As mentioned above, another metric of xerographic printing is data throughput. To improve
data throughput rates, many present systems employ multiple laser beams to concurrently
"write" on the surface of a photoreceptor. The speed-up of the printing process is generally
proportional to the number of independently addressable beams writing on the
photoreceptor.One prior art system employing multiple, independently addressable beams in a facet
tracked configuration is detailed in sagittal view in
