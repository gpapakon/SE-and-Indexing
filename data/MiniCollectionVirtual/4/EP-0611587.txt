<ABSTRACT>
A trap door, in particular a trap door which can be displaced on rollers (13), whose platform (6) is arranged such that it can be displaced vertically via cable pulls in the manner of block and tackle (4,5), exhibits, as drive of the block and tackles, a ball screw (2) which moves a carriage (3) which can be displaced along a guide frame (1) and the relative movement of which, transmitted via block and tackles (4,5), moves the platform (6) telescopically. For safety reasons, provision is made for a telescopic safety frame which, after the displaceable trap door has been set up, is extended and secured to the fixed frame.

Drop lift, in particular a movable individual drop lift, the platform 
(6) of which is vertically displaceably mounted on a guide frame 

(1) via ropes in the fashion of a pulley block (4, 5), and on 
opposite side walls of the guide frame (1) is provided a 

carriage (3), which is displaceable via a spherical spindle (2), 
for changing the height positioning of the platform (6) as a 

drive of the pulley blocks (4, 5) as a drive of the pulley blocks 
(4, 5), 
characterised in that
 the carriage (3) is designed 
between the guide frame (1) and the platform (6) as a guide of 

the platform (6), and the carriage (3) is clamped on one end of 
the pulley block (4, 5) whilst the other end is anchored in the 

platform (6), and the ropes of the pulley block (4, 5) are guided 
via rope rollers (7, 8, 9, 10) positioned on the top and bottom 

end of the guide frame (1). 
Drop lift according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the drop 
comprises a telescopable safety frame which surrounds the 

platform (6) on three sides and which is by devices of the 
movable drop moved upwards by locking to the platform (6) 

and in this state locked to the stationary frame.
