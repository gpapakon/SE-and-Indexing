<ABSTRACT>
Slits (46) are cut in a nozzle tape (40) and aligned 
with encapsulant beads (20) on a printhead (42). The 

slits (46) mechanically decouple portions of the tape (40) 
stuck to the beads (20) from a central portion of the tape 

(40) stuck to a nozzle plate (16), and thereby prevent 
lifting of the tape (40) off the nozzle plate (16) in the 

event that the tape (40) subsequently contracts. A method 
of attaching the tape (40) to the printhead (42) aligns 

blades (44) with the beads (20) on the printhead (42), so 
that the blades (44) cut slits (46) in the tape (40) that 

are aligned with the beads (20). The tape (40) is then 
adhesively secured to the printhead (42), preserving the 

alignment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to inkjet printheads and, in 
particular, to sealing nozzle holes in an inkjet printhead 
to prevent leakage of ink during shipping and storage. A plastic tape has been used on inkjet printheads 
mounted to a print cartridge to seal ink ejection nozzles 
during shipping and storage of the print cartridge. 
Sealing the nozzles is intended to stop ink from seeping 
from the nozzles and clogging the nozzles. Sealing also 
prevents evaporation of the ink as well as prevents the 
ink from being contaminated. Fig. 1 illustrates a prior art inkjet print cartridge 
10. Print cartridge body 12 contains liquid ink which is 
supplied to a substrate (not shown) secured to the back of 
a nozzle plate 16, which may be formed of metal, plastic, 
or any other suitable material. The substrate 
incorporates heater resistors located within ink 
vaporization chambers. When a heater resistor is 
energized, a drop of ink is ejected from an associated 
nozzle 17 formed in nozzle plate 16. A flexible circuit 18 comprises a polymer tape and 
has conductive traces (not shown) formed thereon having 
ends which are bonded to electrodes on the periphery of 
the substrate surface. The traces are bonded to the 
electrodes using an automated bonder. Raised epoxy beads 
20 are dispensed along the edges of nozzle plate 16 to 
protect and encapsulate the substrate electrodes and the 
ends of the traces. The other ends of the conductive traces terminate in 
contact pads 22, which contact electrodes of an ink  
 
printer when print cartridge 10 is installed in the ink 
printer. A flexible plastic nozzle tape 26 is adhesively 
secured over nozzle plate 16 during storage of print 
cartridge 10 in an attempt to prevent ink from seeping out 
of nozzles 17. Figs. 2A, 2B, and 2C are taken along line A-A in Fig. 
1 and illustrate a drawback of the prior art nozzle tape 
26 of Fig. 1. Nozzle tape 26 in Fig. 2A is positioned over nozzle 
plate 16 and pressed onto nozzle plate 16 with an 
applicator 30 (Fig. 2B). A substrate 32 is shown 
supporting nozzle plate 16. Tape 26 must seal securely on nozzle plate 16 to 
prevent leakage of ink from nozzles 17, and the adhesive 
on tape 26 must be a low-tack adhesive so that the user 
can easily remove tape 26 from nozzle plate 16 without 
damaging the printhead or leaving adhesive residue. Typically, tape 26 is wider than nozzle plate 16 and, 
therefore, extends over encapsulant beads 20. Adhesion of 
tape 26 to encapsulant beads 20 is stronger that the 
adhesion of tape 26 to nozzle

<CLAIMS>
A method for ink-sealing nozzles (17) in a 
nozzle plate (16), comprising the steps of: 


providing a printhead (42) having a nozzle plate 
(16) with one or more protruding beads (20) of 

material along one or more peripheral edges of said 
nozzle plate (16); 
providing a flexible tape (40) having a width 
which is wider than a width of said nozzle plate 

(16); 
cutting one or more slits (46) in said tape (40) 
which are aligned with said one or more protruding 

beads (20); and 
attaching said tape (40) to said printhead (42) 
so that a first portion of said tape (40) is affixed 

to a surface of said nozzle plate (16), said one or 
more slits (46) separating said first portion from a 

second portion of said tape (40) affixed to said one 
or more beads (20). 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said step of 
cutting includes aligning a cutting blade (44) with each 

of said one or more protruding beads (20) such that said 
one or more slits (46) are aligned with said one or more 

protruding beads (20). 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said one or more 
protruding beads (20) comprises two parallel beads, and 

said one or more slits (46) comprises two parallel slits 
aligned with said beads. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said printhead 
(42) is located on a print cartridge (10).  

 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said beads (20) of 
material are epoxy beads protecting conductors (18) along 

said one or more peripheral edges of said nozzle plate 
(16). 
A nozzle tape (40) secured to a nozzle plate 
(16) on an inkjet printhead (42) comprising: 


an adhesive tape (40) having one or more slits 
(46) cut therethrough, wherein said slits (46) are 

aligned with one or more protruding beads (20) of 
material along one or more peripheral edges of said 

nozzle plate (16) and mechanically decouple a first 
portion of said tape (40) that contacts said nozzle 

plate (16) from a second portion of said tape (40) 
that contacts said beads (20), said first portion 

acting to seal nozzles (17) in said nozzle plate 
(16). 
The nozzle tape (40) of Claim 6 wherein said 
beads (20) comprise two parallel beads along two edges of 

said nozzle plate (16), and said slits (46) comprise two 
parallel slits aligned with said beads.
