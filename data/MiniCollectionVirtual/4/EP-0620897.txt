<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a swash-plate-type air 
conditioning pump which is preferably adapted for use in an 
automobile. More specifically, the invention relates to a 
swash-plate-type air conditioning pump with double-acting 
pistons. The invention discloses an internal discharge 
cavity modification for such pumps, which suppresses 
pulsation during the discharge of refrigerant gas after 
compression. Most swash-plate-type refrigerant gas compressors used 
in today's automobile air conditioning systems syphon 
refrigerant gas returning from the air conditioning system 
in a multi-cylinder pump. There, the returning gas is 
compressed by pistons which are operated by a single rotary 
swash-plate. After compression, the refrigerant gas is 
discharged from cylinder bores into discharge chambers and 
is distributed via a discharge cavity through passageways 
toward a cooling circuit of the air conditioning system. During compression and discharge of the refrigerant 
gas, there is a pulsation in the discharge pressure of the 
gas imposed by reciprocating motion of the pistons. Among 
other factors, the frequency of pulsation per pump cycle is 
a function of the number of cylinder bores. Such pulsation 
requires suppression if noise and vibration problems are to 
be abated. Conventional approaches to such problems have provided 
a chamber with a substantial volume which acts as a muffling 
chamber. Such approaches are exemplified in U.S. Patent No. 
4,610,604 which issued on September 9, 1986. The disclosure 
of that patent is hereby incorporated by reference. As disclosed therein, after compression, refrigerant 
gas is choked by restraining orifices before entering a 
muffling chamber and undergoing rapid expansion. Following 
such teachings, sudden expansion and subsequent choking of 
refrigerant gas tends to suppress the pulsation caused by  
 
reciprocating motion of the pump's pistons. In such 
approaches, a relatively large volume of muffling chambers 
is needed to obtain the desired efficiency and frequency of 
suppression. United States Patent 4,407,638, on which the preamble of claim 1 is based, describes a swash plate 
type compressor including a partition plate mounted in a 
side cover for axially partitioning the interior of the side 
cover into two portions. One of said two portions 
interposed between the partition plate and a valve plate 
functions as a high pressure chamber, and the other portion 
interposed between the partition wall and a bottom wall 
surface of the cover functions as a

<CLAIMS>
An air conditioning pump for propelling 
refrigerant gas through a cooling circuit, comprising: 


a cylinder block assembly (16) including a front 
cylinder block (34) and a rear cylinder block (36) in mating 

relationship with the front cylinder block (34), wherein 
the cylinder block assembly (16) is provided with a 
plurality of reciprocating pistons (18), each piston being 

in communication with a swash-late (20) fixedly mounted on 
an axially extending rotatable shaft (22), each piston 

moving within a cylinder chamber adapted for syphoning, 
compressing, and discharging the refrigerant gas, wherein 

said plurality of reciprocating pistons (18) are displaced 
in a given activation sequence during each pump cycle; 
a cylinder head assembly (38) which receives the 
cylinder block assembly; and 
a refrigerant gas flow path defined within the cylinder 
block (16) and cylinder head assemblies (38) and being in 

communication with the plurality of reciprocating pistons 
(18), the gas flow path having: 
a discharge cavity (26) defined within the cylinder 
head assembly; 
a discharge cavity port (28) defined within the 
cylinder head assembly in communication with the discharge 

cavity (26); 
a pump discharge port (32) also defined within the 
cylinder head assembly; 
a discharge transfer cavity (30) connected to the 
discharge cavity port (28) for delivering the refrigerant 

gas via the pump discharge port (32) to the cooling circuit, 
wherein 
the discharge transfer cavity (30) associated with the 
rear cylinder block (36) extends arcuately, thereby 

connecting the discharge cavity port (28) and the pump 
discharge port (32) ; and 
the front and rear cylinder blocks together defining an 
axially extending discharge transfer cavity (44)  

 
approximately equalling the length of the arcuate extending discharge transfer cavity 

(30); 
characterised in that the distance between a cylinder chamber and its associated 
discharge cavity port in the front cylinder block (34) equals the distance between the next 

cylinder chamber in the activation sequence and its associated discharge cavity port in the 
rear cylinder block (36) thereby reducing pulsation within the air conditioning pump and 

minimising noise and vibration associated therewith. 
An air conditioning pump according to claim 1, wherein the plurality of 
reciprocating pistons (18) comprises an odd number thereof. 
An air conditioning pump according to claim 1, wherein each piston (18) has 
two ends, the air conditioning pump having an equal number of the plurality of 

reciprocating piston ends disposed within the front (34) and rear (36) cylinder blocks. 
An air conditioning pump according to claim 1, wherein the axially extending 
rotatable shaft (22) turns in a first direction, and the discharge cavity port (28) associated 

with the rear cylinder block (36) is located about 144 degrees from the pump discharge 
port (32), measured in a direction opposite from said first direction. 
An air conditioning pump according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the length of the axially extending discharge transfer cavity (44) 

plus the distance between the cylinder chamber and its associated discharge cavity port 
adjacent the front cylinder block equals the length of the arcuately extending discharge 

transfer cavity (30) of the rear cylinder block plus the distance between the next cylinder 
chamber in the activation sequence and its associated discharge cavity port adjacent the 

rear cylinder block.
