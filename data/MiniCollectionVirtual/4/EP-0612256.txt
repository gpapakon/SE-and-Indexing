<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for
performing partial liquid ventilation techniques.
Such apparatus can be used with
biocompatible liquid fluorocarbons in treatment of various
pulmonary conditions.Methods for performing partial liquid ventilation with
fluorocarbon liquids do not require complicated liquid-handling
ventilation equipment with associated oxygenators and
other paraphernalia; instead, traditional ventilation
equipment can be used. Perfluorocarbon liquid is instilled
into the lung and remains there in a quantity approximately
equal to or less than the functional residual capacity of the
lungs (the lung volume plus endotracheal tube volume upon
exhalation). Gas then moves into and out of the lung to
oxygenate the perfluorocarbon liquid in the lung. The
perfluorocarbon liquid permits respiration by the patient even
though the lungs are damaged or surfactant deficient.Lung surfactant functions to reduce surface tension
within the alveoli. It mediates transfer of oxygen and carbon
dioxide, promotes alveolar expansion and covers the lung
surfaces. Reduced surface tension permits the alveoli to be
held open under less pressure. In addition, lung surfactant
maintains alveolar expansion by varying surface tension with
alveolar size (The Pathologic Basis of Disease, Robbins and
Cotran eds. W.B. Saunders Co. New York, 1979). There are a
number of medical therapies or regimes that would benefit from
the use of surfactant supplements. For example, surfactant
supplementation is beneficial for individuals with lung
surfactant deficiencies. In addition, there are a variety of
medical procedures requiring that fluids be added to the lung,
for example, as a wash to remove endogenous or exogenous
matter. The use of a biocompatible liquid for these
applications would be advantageous. Routinely, balanced salt 
solutions or balanced salt solutions in combination with a
given therapeutic agent are provided as an aspirate or as a
lavage for patients with asthma, cystic fibrosis or
bronchiectasis. While balanced saline is biocompatible,
lavage procedures can remove endogenous lung surfactant.
Further, lavage with such aqueous liquids may not permit
adequate delivery of oxygen to the body. Therefore, it is
contemplated that the use of substances having at least some
of the functional properties of lung surfactant could decrease
lung trauma and provide an improved wash fluid.At present, surfactant supplements are used
therapeutically in infants when the amount of lung surfactant
present is not sufficient

An apparatus for introduction and removal of a
liquid from the lung of a patient, comprising:


an endotracheal tube (12) comprising a means (20) for introducing
a liquid into at least a portion of the lung (24)

wherein said introducing means (20) is adapted such that the
patient can simultaneously breath a gas into that same

portion of the lung (24); and
means for removing said liquid from the lung while the patient is simultaneously
breathing a gas, said removing means including a remover (26) adapted to

maintain a relatively constant volume of the liquid in the lung while simultaneously
breathing gas.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said introducing
means (20) is adapted to continuously introduce said liquid.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said introducing
means (20) is adapted to introduce said liquid simultaneously

with the inhalation of said gas.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said remover (26)
is adapted to remove said liquid during a portion of the

breathing cycle in which the lung (24) is substantially deflated.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said remover (26)
is adapted to be positioned in the patient's trachea (16) or in

close proximity thereto to remove liquid from the trachea (16)
that comes in contact with said remover (26).
The apparatus of claim 5, wherein said remover (26)
is located in said endotracheal tube (12) which is adapted to be

located at a fixed position in the trachea (16).
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a
gas/liquid separator (64) adapted to be interposed in the pathway

of fluid flowing into and out of the lungs (24). 
The apparatus of claim 7, wherein said gas/liquid
separator (64) is adapted to separate fluorocarbon liquid exiting

the lungs (24) from gas exhaled by the patient, so that at the
end of exhalation the liquid level in the patient's

breathing passageway extends substantially up to but not
beyond the gas/liquid separator (64).
The apparatus of claim 7, wherein said
endotracheal tube (12) is connected to said gas/liquid separator (64).
The apparatus of claim 5, wherein the introducing
means (20) is adapted to continuously introduce liquid, and

said removing means is adapted to remove the liquid
at a rate greater than or

equal to the rate of introduction by the introducing means (20).
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising means (52)
for pulsing the introduction of liquid into the lungs (24) in

synchrony with a portion of the breathing cycle.
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising means (44)
for pulsing the removal of liquid from the lungs (24) in

synchrony with a portion of the breathing cycle.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said apparatus
includes a temperature control device to control the

temperature of the liquid introduced into the lungs (24).
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising a
reservoir (30) into which said removed liquid is directed.
The apparatus of claim 14, wherein the introducing
means (20) is adapted to remove liquid from said reservoir (30) for

reintroduction into the lungs (24).
The apparatus of claim 15, further comprising
means (72) for separating contaminating material from the liquid

in the reservoir (30) prior to reintroduction into the lungs (24).

is adapted to separate floating contaminants from a
fluorocarbon liquid.
The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the reservoir (30)

the introducing means (10) removes fluorocarbon liquid from the
reservoir (30) from a point below the level of the

fluorocarbon/aqueous aspirant interface.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the introducing
means (20) and said remover (26) means are attached to said

endotracheal tube (12).
