<ABSTRACT>
A self-expanding stent (10) formed of stainless steel 
wire arranged in a closed zig-zag configuration includes an 

endless series of straight sections (13) joined at their 
ends by bends (14). The stent is compressible into a 

reduced diameter size for insertion into and removal from a 
body passageway. The bends of at least one end of the stent 

are formed into eyes (20) for connection with the eyes at 
one end of a similarly constructed stent to permit 

single-step introduction of several lengths of stent into 

the passageway. A stent can include a monofilament thread 
(40) passing through successive eyes at one end of the 

stent, the thread passing through each eye at least once and 
through some of the eyes a second time. The trailing ends 

(40a, 40b) of the thread extend from the stent and outside 
the body passageway. The stent can be retrieved from the 

body passageway by threading a tube (70) over the free ends 
of the thread until the tube is adjacent the stent. The 

diameter at one end of the stent is reduced by pulling the 
free ends of the thread through the tube. A sheath (75) 

concentrically disposed over the tube is introduced into the 
body passageway and over the remaining length of the stent 

to further compress the stent for removal from the 
passageway.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stents and 
in particular, the invention relates to 
modifications to the Gianturco Expandable Wire Stent. It is desirable in various situations to provide means 
for expanding a constricted vessel portion or for 
maintaining an open passageway through a vessel portion. 
Such situations arise, for example, in conjunction with 
arteriosclerosis that restricts or stops blood flow through 
a vessel, or in conjunction with diseases of the prostrate 
gland which restrict or stop flow through the urethra. A percutaneous stent developed by Dr. Cesare Gianturco 
is formed of a stainless steel wire arranged in a closed, 
zig-zag pattern, as more fully described in U.S. Patent No. 
4,580,568. The Gianturco stent, or the Z-stent as it is 
also known, is compressed into a reduced size shape with an 
outer diameter which is many times smaller its outer 
diameter in an expanded shape. The stent is positioned in a 
passageway by means of a sheath while the stent is retained 
in the compressed reduced size shape. A pusher or 
flat-ended catheter is used through the sheath to hold the 
stent in place in the passageway while the sheath is 
withdrawn, thereby allowing the stent to expand in the 
passageway into its expanded shape to hold the passageway 
open and enlarged. Thus, the Z-stent provides a 
self-expanding means for maintaining an open passageway. 
FIG. 1 illustrates the use of the well-known Z-stent wire 
within a body passageway. FIG. 2 illustrates the use of several Z-stents along a 
limited length of a body passageway. In illustrated 
arrangement, two stents are situated in an overlapping 
arrangement, while a third stent is disposed slightly 
downstream from the other two stents. As discussed more  
 
fully in the above-referenced Gianturco '568 patent, each of 
the three stents must be separately inserted using the 
sheath and pusher described above. Since the initial development of the expandable wire 
Z-stent, it has been discovered that over time a Z-stent may 
continue to expand to its maximum diameter even though it 
was originally deployed in a passageway that had a diameter 
somewhat smaller than the maximum outer diameter of the 
expanded stent. Thus, the end result has been in some cases 
that the stent becomes embedded deeply into the walls of the 
passageway. In an effort to address this particular 
problem, others in the art have modified the expandable 
Z-stent to form eyes at the bends or joints of the zig-zag 
configuration. A monofilament line is then threaded

<CLAIMS>
A stent assembly (10) comprising:
 
   a first wire formed into a closed zig-zag 

configuration including:
 
   an endless series of straight sections (13) 

having opposite ends, said straight sections being 
joined by bends (14) at said opposite ends to form a 

stent;
 
   a set of eyes (20) formed at several of said 

bends at one of said opposite ends; and
 
   a thread (40) passing through successive ones 

of said set of eyes,
 
   wherein said stent is resiliently contractible 

into a smaller first shape for conveyance through a body 
passageway; and
 
   wherein said stent is resiliently expandable into 

a second shape in which the straight sections press against 
the walls of the body passageway,
 
   characterised in that said thread includes a pair 

of free ends (40a, 40b), trailing from said stent. 
The stent assembly of claim 1, wherein:
 
   said second shape of said stent includes a 

circumference at said one of said opposite ends, said set 
of eyes being situated at said circumference; and
 
   said thread passes through successive eyes (20) 

at least 360° around said circumference. 
The stent assembly of claim 2, wherein said 
thread passes through successive eyes (20) approximately 

540° around said circumference. 
The stent assembly of claim 1, wherein said 
free ends (40a, 40b) are sufficiently long to extend  

 
outside the body passageway when said stent is situated 

within the passageway. 
The stent assembly (10) of claim 1, further

   a second wire (11'') formed into a closed zig-zag 

configuration including:
 
   a second endless series of straight sections 

having opposite ends, said straight sections being
