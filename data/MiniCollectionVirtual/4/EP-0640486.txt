<ABSTRACT>
In a thermal-transfer-type color printer, an ink ribbon (2) and 
a paper (6) are sandwiched between a thermal head (4) 

and a platen roller (12) 
so that a specific image is transferred onto the paper (6) in a 

specific color. The platen roller (12) is made by a rubber material 
which has a certain degree of hardness. On the surface of the 

ink ribbon (2), plural colors of ink are sequentially and repeatedly 
painted. Hence, after transferring an image onto the paper (6) in 

one color, the paper (6) is moved backward; and then, another image 
is transferred onto the paper (6) in another color. Thus, a multi-color 

printing is performed. In order to avoid a color shade or 
an printing error, in which a printing position of one-color 

image does not accurately match with a printing position of 
another-color image, the paper (6) should be accurately moved forward 

and backward. In order to do so, the thermal-transfer-type color 
printer provides a precise paper-feed mechanism which comprises a 

pinch roller (16) and a paper-feed roller (17). Around a surface of the 
paper-feed roller (17), micro projections are formed in predetermined 

size and shape, so that the paper (6) is certainly held between the 
pinch roller (16) and paper-feed roller (17). The micro 

projections can be 
formed at a selected surface area of the paper-feed roller (17). 

Those micro projections are formed by carrying out an etching 
process using a masking pattern formed at a certain surface area 

of the paper-feed roller (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal-transfer-type
color printer which transfers colored images onto a sheet member by
using an ink ribbon.FIG. 1 is a drawing simply illustrating an example of a
mechanical structure of a thermal-transfer-type color printer
conventionally known. In FIG. 1, an ink ribbon 2, which has not
been used yet, is wound around a ribbon-supply roller 1. The
overall area of the ink ribbon 2 is divided into a plenty of
areas in a longitudinal direction, wherein each of those areas is
painted with ink having a specific color. For example, three
colors (i.e., yellow color, magenta color and cyan color) of ink
are sequentially and repeatedly painted on the ink ribbon 2; or
four colors (i.e., yellow color, magenta color, cyan color and
black color) of ink are sequentially and repeatedly painted on
the ink ribbon 2.The ink ribbon 2, supplied from the ribbon-supply roller 1,
is led to a place between a thermal head 4 and a platen roller 5
by means of a guide roller 3. A paper 6 is wound around the
platen roller 5, so that the ink ribbon 2 comes in contact with
the paper 6. The ink, painted on the ink ribbon 2, is melted by
heat, applied by the thermal head 4, so that a specific image is
transferred onto the paper 6 with a specific color. After a
printing is performed, the ink ribbon 2 turns to a used ink
ribbon 7, which is then led to a ribbon-winding roller 9 by means
of a guide roller 8. Thus, the used ink ribbon 7 is wound up
around the ribbon-winding roller 9. The platen roller 5 is made by rubber materials and the
like. This platen roller 5 is sandwiched between pinch rollers
10 and 11.When transferring one-color ink (e.g., yellow-color ink)
onto the paper 6, the platen roller 5 is driven to rotate in a
forward direction. In this case, the paper 6 is held between the
platen roller 5 and the pinch rollers 10, 11 which are pressed
with each other; and the paper 6 is transported in a direction
"m". At the same time, the ink ribbon 2, supplied from the
ribbon-supply roller 1, is led to the place between the thermal
head 4 and the platen roller 5 by means of the guide roller 3;
and then, the used ink ribbon 7 is led to the ribbon-winding
roller 9 by means of the guide roller 8 and is wound up.In addition, the thermal head 4 is driven to move in a
direction "p" by a spring (not shown), so that the thermal head 4
is pressed against the ink ribbon 2. In synchronism with a speed
of carrying the ink ribbon 2 and the paper 6, heating elements of
the thermal head 4 are heated in response to
