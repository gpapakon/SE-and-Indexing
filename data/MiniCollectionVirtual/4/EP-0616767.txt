<ABSTRACT>
An aquarium tank filter flow regulator (60) is 
disposed in a pipe (50) between a first filter mechanism 

(30) for performing physical filtering and a second filter 
mechanism (40) for performing biological filtering. It 

includes a stationary tube (61) having its peripheral wall 
formed with a plurality of stationary slits (64S) and with 

a knob guide slit (64P), and an opening area adjusting 
member (67) disposed for rotation or axial sliding inside 

the stationary tube and having a knob (70) projecting 
through the guide slit and a plurality of rotary slits 

(69). The overlapping portions of the rotary slits and 
the stationary slits constitute an opening area that can 

be varied by moving the knob along the guide slit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a flow regulator for an 
aquarium tank filter used in an aquarium tank for keeping 
and displaying tropical fish or the like. The usual aquarium tank comprises a tank body, a 
cover, an illuminator, a filter, etc. Of these aquarium tank components, the filter serves 
to filter out contaminants from the water in the tank 
both physically and biologically. The illuminator and filter are designed so as to 
cover the open top of the tank body. Figure 5 is a schematic perspective view of a prior 
art aquarium tank, similar to that described in JP-U-5-82262, 
but including a second filter. Referring to Figure 5, reference numeral 1 
designates a tank body open at the top, and 11 a cover 
covering the open top of the tank body 1. The cover 11 
is equipped on its underside with an illuminator 12A 
fitted with fluorescent lamps and also has a filter 12B 
for filtering the water in the tank body 1. The illuminator 12A is disposed so as to cover the 
front part of the top of the tank body 1, while the 
filter 12B is disposed so as to cover the rear part of 
the top of the tank body 1. Figure 6 is a sectional view taken along line VI-VI 
in Figure 5.  
 Referring to Figure 6, the filter 12B includes a 
filter tank casing 13B, a cover 13C covering the open top 
of the filter tank casing 13B, a pump mechanism 20 partly 
accommodated in the filter tank casing 13B, a first filter 
mechanism 30 mostly accommodated in the filter tank casing 
13B, a second filter mechanism 40 disposed on the bottom 
of the tank body 1, and a connecting pipe 50 which 
connects the second filter mechanism 40 and pump mechanism 
20. The structure of the first filter mechanism 30 is not 
shown. The pump mechanism 20 includes a motor 21 
accommodated in the filter tank casing 13B, a cylindrical 
member 22 extending from the motor 21 into the tank body 
1, an intermediate frame 23 provided on the lower end of 
the cylindrical member 22 and accommodating a rotary vane 
assembly (not shown), and a water force-up pipe 24 
extending from the intermediate frame 23 into the filter 
tank casing 13B and having an end connected to the first 
filter mechanism 30. The first filter mechanism 30 serves to filter 
out floating matter from water W received from the force-up 
pipe 24 physically with chemical fibers or like 
filtering material. It is provided with an L-shaped drain 
pipe 31 for returning the filtered water W into the tank 
body 1. The second filter mechanism 40 serves to filter 
out organic matter dissolved in the
