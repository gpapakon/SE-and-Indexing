<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an apparatus (1) for changing the position of a gondola (10) which is suspended in a vertically adjustable manner by means of a travelling mechanism (13), the invention provides, for the vertical and/or horizontal adjustment of the gondola (10), two drive members (21; 31) which each have a flexible pulling member (22; 32). The drive members (21; 31) are fitted in a stationary manner on a structure (2) bearing the travelling mechanism (13), and the pulling members (22; 32) are fastened on the gondola (10) by means of their free ends. Furthermore, the drive members (21; 31) can be driven individually or together such they are made to move in the same direction or in opposite directions from one another. This configuration results in the drive members (21; 31) required to move the travelling mechanism (13) and to adjust the gondola (10) vertically being able to be arranged in a stationary manner, so that said drive members can be supplied with energy without difficulties.

An arrangement for moving along the wall sides of a building, having a 
guide rail attached to the construction, a gondola hanging from tension 

ties, at least one propulsion element for altering the height of the 
gondola by means of the tension ties and a running gear connected to 

the guide rail for the purpose of allowing the gondola to change its 
position horizontally,
characterised in that,
 
two propulsion elements (21; 31) are fixedly connected to the tension 

ties (22; 32) on either end of the guide rail (11) for the purposes of 
moving the gondola (10) vertically and/or horizontally, that the gondola 

(10) is suspended from the free ends of the tension ties (22; 32) and 
that the propulsion elements (21; 31) can be controlled in such a way as 

to be driven individually or in unison in the same direction as, or 
opposite directions to, one another (Fig. 1).

guide rail attached to the construction, a gondola hanging from tension ties, at 

least one propulsion element for altering the height of the gondola by means of 
the tension ties and a running gear connected to the guide rail for the purpose 

of allowing the gondola to change its position horizontally,
characterised in that,
 
two propulsion elements (21; 31) are attached to the gondola (10), with 

each propulsion element (21; 31) being connected to a tension tie (22; 

32), the free ends of which are fixed to the areas at the end of the guide 
rail (11) on the construction for the purposes of moving the gondola (10) 

vertically and/or horizontally and that the propulsion elements (21; 31) 
can be controlled in such a way as to be driven individually or in unison 

in the same direction as, or opposite directions to, one another (Fig. 2).

the guide rail for the purpose of allowing the gondola to change its 
position horizontally,
characterised in that
,
 
two propulsion elements (21; 31) are fixedly connected to the tension 

ties (22; 32) on either end of the guide rail (11) for the purposes of 
moving the gondola (10) vertically and/or horizontally, that the gondola 

(10) is suspended from the free ends of one tension tie (32) whilst the  
 

free end of the other tension tie (22) is fixed onto the running gear (13) 
and that the propulsion elements (21; 31) can be controlled in such a 

way as to be driven individually or in unison in the same direction as, or
