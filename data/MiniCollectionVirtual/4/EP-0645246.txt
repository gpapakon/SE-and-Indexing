<ABSTRACT>
When a recording head having an arrangement of plural 
ejection portions for ejecting ink is moved for scanning, 

coefficients for the calculation of blur correction are set 
according to the number of nozzles used during scanning 

(magnification), and image signals corresponding to nozzles 
at scanning boundaries are corrected by an amount selected 

according to the set coefficients. This method makes it 
possible to always obtain a good image in which stripes 

formed at such boundaries are reduced even if image 
recording conditions are changed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ink jet recording
apparatus and a recording method and, more particularly, to
an ink jet recording apparatus and a recording method for
performing recording by serial scanning.Ink jet recording apparatuses arranged to record images
by ejecting ink onto recording members are known. Recently,
such ink jet recording apparatuses have been developed
rapidly and have come into wide use because they can easily
be employed to perform multi-color recording, can easily be
reduced in size and have other advantages. In such ink jet
recording apparatuses, ink blurs on a recording medium
greatly influence image quality.In a serial scan type ink jet recording apparatus, as
shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), a scanning travel of a
recording head 9 in a direction of arrow A (in a main
scanning direction) for image recording of a width d is
repeated in the order of areas (1), (2), and (3). The width 
d is determined by the number of nozzles and the recording
density of the head; it is 16.256 mm if the recording
apparatus has 256 nozzles and a recording density of 400
dots/inch.If the amount of ink applied for recording is small,
the extent of blurring is small and the recorded image
width, i.e., the width of a recorded image portion formed by
one scanning travel of the head, is substantially equal to
the recording width d. In such a situation, at most only
minor image defects occur at junctures between recorded
image portions, which correspond to cycles of scanning in
which the head is moved in the direction of arrow B (in a
sub scanning direction) and is thereafter moved in the
direction of arrow A.However, in a high-density image portion, i.e., an
image portion having a large amount of ink, an ink blur
occurs such that the recorded image width is d + Δd. If the
scanning width in the direction B is d, then image portions
overlap each other by Δd to form a black stripe (banding)
Conversely, if the scanning width is previously set to d +
Δd, a white stripe is formed in a low-density image portion
where the amount of ejected ink is large.In view of this problem, the inventors of the present
invention have proposed image recording apparatuses in which
when a value of an image signal corresponding to a serial 
scanning boundary is larger, it is corrected by being
reduced to prevent formation of a black stripe, as described
in the specifications of U.S. Patent No. 5,225,849 (Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 2-3326 and 2-25338)
