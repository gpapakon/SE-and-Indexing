<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a weather guard (1) intended to be fitted externally to a window. The guard includes a frame and a cloth (2) coacting with the frame (4, 4a, 4b, 4c) and the frame is intended to abut parts of the building facade (A, A') that are located adjacent the window, such as to form a free space (B) between the window frame and the cloth (2). The frame comprises a plurality of frame-members which extend from a common securing device (3), and a number of these frame-members are pivotally connected to the securing device (3) so as to be movable between a mutually diverging, window-covering position in which the cloth is stretched-out, and a collapsed transport position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a weather guard for 
one or more windows, and particularly to a weather 
guard which is intended to be fitted externally onto a 
building and which is dimensioned to cover not only the 
window or windows, but also the window linings. The weather guard is of the kind which has the form of 
a frame which supports a cloth or fabric, wherein the 
frame and cloth are adapted so that the edges of the 
cloth can be brought into abutment with parts of the 
building facade located adjacent the window and to form 
a free, limited space between window frame, window 
lining or reveal and said cloth. Window guards of the aforedescribed kind are known to 
the art in several different forms, and have been 
proposed with the intention of enabling primarily 
maintenance to be carried out on window frames and 
external window linings or reveals, for example, 
painting, in principle the whole year round, by protecting 
said frames and linings against rain, heavy 
winds, snow and cold. One such known window guard used in practice (which is 
extensible and collapsible) is described and illustrated 
on an information sheet entitled "Mästartips", 
published by Mälaremästarnas Riksförening, No. 1, June, 
1986. The frame of this known weather guard consists in  
 
a number of frame members which include two mutually 
opposing frame-members which are mutually joined in a 
concertina-like fashion, and when in its extended or 
opened-out position and fitted to a window frame, the 
guard forms a box-like configuration on the outside of 
the window. A similar construction which comprises extruded aluminium 
profiled sections and a flame-proof and reinforced 
plastic sheet is earlier known from a product 
leaflet 4-4 published by BYGG TEMA AB, 
914 00 Nordmaling, Sweden. It is further to be mentioned that the present invention is considered developed 
from the arrangement disclosed in the Publication SE-A-445 571 where an arrangement 
according to the preamble of Claim 1 is previously known. As prior art can also be mentioning the arrangements disclosed in the Patent 
Publications; SE-B-445 378; SE-B-450 508; DE-C2-2 814 871 and US-A-2 834 441. The present invention also makes use of constructing elements found in common 
umbrella arrangements. When studying the known prior art, as described above, 
it will be see that a technical problem resides in the 
provision of an umbrella-like weather guard for the aforesaid purpose 
which is not only light in weight but which can also be 
readily extended,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A weather guard intended and adapted to be fitted by the use of a securing arrangement externally of 
a window and comprising a frame and a cloth or fabric 

which coacts with said frame, said frame being intended to 
abut with facade surfaces located adjacent the window, 

such as to form a free space between the window frame 
and the cloth, 
characterized
 in that the 
frame comprises a number of frame-members (4-4c) which extend 

from a common central securing device (3) in an umbrella-like manner, in that at least 
some of said frame-members (4-4c) are pivotally connected to 

said securing device (3, 32, 33) so as to enable said members to be 
swung to mutually diverging window-covering positions 

in which the cloth is extended, and a collapsed transport 
position, that said securing device (3, 32, 33) forms a part of 

said securing arrangement (3.32.33.11.10) and that edges of the cloth 
are formed to lie against parts of the building in a guard fitted position. 
A guard according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 in that all frame-members (4-4c) are pivotally 
connected to the securing device (32) and extend in elongated 

pockets or sleeves provided in the cloth. 
A guard according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that a number of frame-members comprise 

a straight-part (41) which extend from the securing 
device (32) and which are terminated with a curved or bent 

part (42). 
A guard according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the curved or bent part (42) defines 

an angle (a) of from 90-45°, preferably 60-80°, with said 
straight part (41). 
A guard according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized
 
in that the curved or bent part (42-44a) has a 

length of 5-25 cm, preferably about 15 cm.  
 
A guard according to Claim 1, 
charac-terized
 
in that the securing device (3) includes in a fitted position an 

inwardly extending rod (32) which has fastener means, for 
instance in the form of an eye (33), provided on the free 

end thereof. 
A guard according to Claim 1 or 5, 
characterized
 by tensioning means (11) provided between the 
securing device (3) and a post, which forms part of the 

window structure. 
A guard according to Claim 1 or 5, 
characterized
 
in that a post (10) comprises two mutually 

telescopic parts (10a.10b) which are separate from the window 
structure. 
A guard according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the cloth is dimensioned to 

extend beyond the free end of respective curved or bent 
parts, at least between mutually adjacent ends, through 

a distance of 3-10 cm, preferably about 5 cm.
