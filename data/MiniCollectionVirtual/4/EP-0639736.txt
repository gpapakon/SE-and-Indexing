<ABSTRACT>
Control valve comprising a housing (1) with a cylindrical valve chamber (2), the valve chamber (2) being provided with at least one inlet (3) and at least two outlets (4, 5, 6), the inlet (3) and the outlets (4, 5, 6) being at least partially closeable when required by means of a single common valve element (8) that can be rotated about an axis (7) and is arranged in the valve chamber (2), the valve element (8) being designed as a rotary slide and being actuable by a drive (9), the inlet (3) and/or at least one of the outlets (4, 5, 6) being surrounded on that side of the housing (1) which faces the valve element (8) by a seal (10) and the seal (10) being movable into sealing engagement with the valve element (8) with elastic prestress. The valve element (8) has an extent in the circumferential direction of the valve chamber (2) which is in each case limited by an edge (11, 12), the outflow edge (13), which travels over the inlet (3) as it opens, having an elliptical indentation (14) extending in the axial direction.

<CLAIMS>
A control valve, comprising a housing (1) with a 
cylindrical valve chamber (2), the valve chamber (2) 

being provided with at least one inlet (3) and at least 
two outlets (4, 5, 6), it being possible for the inlet 

(3) and the outlets (4, 5, 6) to be at least partially 
closed, if required, by only one common cylindrical valve 

element (8) which can be rotated about an axis (7) and is 
arranged in the valve chamber (2), the valve element (8) 

being designed as a rotary slide and being actuable by a 
drive (9), the inlet (3) and/or at least one of the 

outlets (4, 5, 6) being surrounded by a seal (10) on the 
side of the housing (1) facing the valve element (8), it 

being possible for the seal (10) to be brought into 
sealing engagement with the valve element (8) under 

elastic prestress, and the valve element (8) having an 
extent in the circumferential direction of the valve 

chamber (2) which is bounded in each case by an edge (11, 
12), characterized in that the flow-off edge (13) which 

moves over the inlet (3) while it is being opened has an 
elliptical recess (14) extending in the axial direction. 
A control valve according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the recess (14) is arranged in each case 

with spacing adjacent to the axial boundaries (15, 16) of 
the valve element (8). 
A control valve according to either of claims 1 
or 2, characterized in that the valve element (8) can be 

actuated by an electrically driven stepping motor, and in 
that the stepping motor is connected in a signal-conducting 

manner to an electronic control device. 
A control valve according to any of claims 1 to  
 

3, characterized in that the seal (10) is formed by an 
annular shaped-part seal made of PTFE and is supported on 

the side remote from the valve element (8) on a spring 
element (17) so as to be elastically flexible in the 

axial direction of the shaped-part seal. 
A control valve according to claim 4, characterized 
in that the spring element (17) is formed by an O-ring 

made of elastomeric material. 
A control valve according to any of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the housing (1) has an inlet (3) 

and three outlets (4, 5, 6). 
The use of a control valve according to claim 6 
in a liquid cooling system of an internal combustion 

engine, characterized in that the inlet (3) is connected 
in a liquid-conducting manner to the cooling-water outlet 

of the internal combustion engine, in that the outlet 
openings (4, 5, 6) are connected to the radiator circuit, 

the short circuit and the circuit for the vehicle 
interior heating, in that the outlet (4) to the radiator 

circuit on the one hand and the outlet (6) to the 
interior heating circuit on the other hand are arranged 

adjacent to the inlet (3) in the circumferential direction 
of the valve chamber (2), in that the inlet (3) and 

the outlets (4, 6) for the radiator and the interior 
heating can together be completely closed, and in that 

the outlet (5) of the short circuit is only completely 
closed by the valve element (8) when the inlet (3) and 

the outlets (4, 6) adjoining it on both sides in the 
circumferential direction allow complete throughflow.
