<ABSTRACT>
In the die-pressing method of the magnet powder and fine 
powder, the powder is filled at a high density in a rubber mold 

(10), is occasionally preliminarily magnetized (4a) in the rubber 
mold and is then compacted under magnetic field or without 

magnetic field. Cracking of the magnet green compact is 
prevented. A sintered compact having density of 90% or more can 

be produced using the fine powder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method 
for producing permanent magnet and sintered compact. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a method for 
compacting the permanent-magnet powder under magnetic field 
while enhancing the anisotropic property and hence enhancing 
magnetic properties of permanent magnets. The particles of the 
powder as compacted are oriented in the easy direction of 
magnetization. The so-oriented particles are then subjected to 
compacting and the particles are fixed by the compacting force. 
The green compact is then sintered to obtain the sintered 
magnet. Alternatively, resin is impregnated into the 
so-oriented powder so as to obtain the resin-bonded magnet. The 
permanent-magnet (hereinafter referred to as the "magnet") 
powder and resin may be compacted together to obtain the resin 
bonded magnet. In addition, the present invention relates to a method for 
producing a sintered compact by means of die-pressing the fine 
powder of the ordinary material, i.e., the material other than 
the magnet material, under no magnetic field and then sintering 
the green compact. More particularly, the conventional die-pressing 
method is improved such that the fine powder be 
compacted. In the powder-metallurgy technique, not only the 
density of a sintered compact increases but also the grain size 
of a sintered compact be refined by means of lessening the 
particle diameter of the powder. As a result, the such sintered 
materials as Al and Ti are considerably strengthened, and the 
magnetic properties of soft magnetic ferrous material are 
enhanced. However, the flowability of fine powder is very poor. 
When the powder having poor flowability is filled in a die 
under gravity, the bridging phenomenon is very liable to occur 
in the die, and the filling density greatly varies for each 
filling. The weight of each green compacts (hereinafter referred 
to as "unit weight") varies greatly and the average filling  
 
density of the powder lowers. The present invention is also related to a production 
apparatus of a green compact, which is subjected to the sintering 
or to the production of magnet. Although the CIP (cold isostatic pressing) is used for 
compacting the magnet powder, this method is not industrially 
carried out, because the compacting process is complicated, 
that is, the magnet powder is oriented in a rubber mold under 
the magnetic field, then the rubber mold is immersed in a 
liquid medium, and the particles of the magnet powder are 
isostatically compacted
