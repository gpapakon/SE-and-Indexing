<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a hose (10) which comprises at 
least one tubular layer (3) of plastic or rubber material, 

a mesh-network (4) of the chain type presenting mesh lines 
(5) and mesh rows (6) having a tubular shape being wound on 

the external surface of said inner layer, a possible external 
layer (7), and is characterized in that said mesh rows 

are slanted in relation to the longitudinal axis of the 
hose. According to a preferred embodiment the lines (5) of 

said meshes are slanted in relation to the longitudinal 
axis Y of the hose, following a direction opposite to the 

direction of the mesh rows (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a hose made of plastic or rubber 
material and reinforced with a mesh stocking for bearing 
fluids under pressure in the hydraulic sector or even in 
field of the distribution of fluids under pressure in open 
or closed circuits. It is a known fact that the hoses mostly made of plastic 
material and suitable to bear fluids under pressure, present 
a first internal tubular layer made of plastic material 
or rubber, which is lined with a tubular fabric having 
the purpose of increasing the pressure resistance of the 
hose, of reducing its deformation and of increasing its 
performances. One of the most used types of hose suited for the purpose, 
is the so-called "latticed" hose, in which the tubular 
layer of plastic material is reinforced with a series of 
threads wound in a spiral over the hose, said threads being 
arranged parallel, equally spaced and overlaying as many 
other transversal threads arranged at a symmetrical angular 
position in relation to an axis parallel to the hose axis, 
so as to form a regular rhombus lattice. This latticed 
fabric, wound on the external surface of said inner hose 
layer, is then attached through another external layer 
generally, but not necessarily, transparent which secures 
the latticed fabric to the hose itself. With this type of 
stocking the hose is suitable to bear a higher pressure 
than a hose without stocking, without any substantial 
deformations occurring, since the weaving does not yield 
and therefore prevents the inner layer of the hose from 
deforming. A limit of the just described latticed hose consists in 
that its flexibility is relatively low, i.e. the bending 
radiuses under which the hose can be subjected, are rather 
wide in relation to the meshed hoses. Another type of just as well-known flexible hose is the  
 
hose in which the stocking wound over the external part of 
the hose is made in the shape of a network. The EP-A 0 527 512 patent document, filed by the same 
Applicant, discloses an hose provided with a mesh made in 
the form of a series of trapezoidal loops with crossing 
filaments at the corners. With said mesh the hole increases 
the strength with respect to similar hoses. It is a known fact that the network is a special kind of 
weaving obtained with one or more threads which are linked 
together with more or less winding loops, also called 
"bushes" or "elementary meshes", which give to said mesh-network 
fabric a characteristic of high elasticity. The so-called "chain" mesh-network, consists of a series
