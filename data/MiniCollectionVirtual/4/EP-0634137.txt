<ABSTRACT>
A device for eliminating ringings in filtered ECG-signals 
comprises an A/D-converter (10) for converting analog input 

signals into a series of digital values and a filter unit 
(14, 16) connected to the output of the A/D-converter. The 

filter unit comprises a recursive IIR-filter (14) and a 
subsequent allpass-filter (16) with a phase shift which is 

equal to twice the phase shift of the IIR-filter. The 
allpass-filtration is performed time-reversed in relation to 

the IIR-filtration. In a method for producing an allpass-filter 
(16) with a phase shift which is equal to twice the 

phase shift of an IIR-filter (14) the zero points of which 
are situated on the unity circle in the Z-plane, which 

allpass-filter is suitable for use in the device according 
to the invention, the zero points of the IIR-filter are 

replaced by new zero points obtained by reflecting the poles 
of the filter in the unity circle in the Z-plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for eliminating 
ringings in filtered ECG-signals, comprising an A/D-converter 
for converting analog input signals into a series 
of digital values and a filter unit connected to the output 
of the A/D-converter. Different kinds of signal filtration are required for the 
analysis of ECG-signals. The ECG-signal recorded between two electrodes on the 
patient's body, e.g. on the arms and legs, also contains a 
DC potential, in addition to the ECG-signal, which may be 
much larger than the ECG-signal. These DC potential or low-frequency 
signals vary because of relative movements of the 
body and the electrode as a result of e.g. the patient's 
breathing movements. Two-pass filtering is one way to remove these DC signals 
and low-frequency signals from the ECG-signal. A filter with 
a linear phase is then provided by both forward and backward 
filtration of the signal with a filter with a non-linear 
phase, see e.g. GB patent 1 556 512, which describes this 
filtration with analog filters. A linear phase is desirable 
at the filtration, since phase distortion is then eliminated 
and with that a minor distortion of the ECG-signal's 
morphology results. However, the disadvantage of a filter 
with a linear phase is that the ringing problem is not 
completely eliminated. Ringings, whose morphology and 
duration depend on the filter's transmission function, will  
 
persist. A so-called FIR-filter can also be used for 
realizing a filter with a linear phase, but the steepness of 
the filter's slope must be sacrificed if the filter is to be 
implemented in a device with limited memory or limited 
computational capacity. The presence of high-frequency signals with small amplitudes 
on the microvolt level at the end of the QRS-complex in 
post-infarction patients has been shown to be a good 
indication of an increased risk of future life-menacing 
ventricular arrhythmias, see European Heart Journal (1991), 
12, pp. 473 - 480. High-pass filtration is needed in order 
to identify and analyze these late potentials. One problem 
is then the ringing induced by the QRS signal itself and 
which readily drowns out any late potentials. Several 
proposals to solutions of this problem have been presented. 
In Link and Trahms, "Highpass Filters for Detecting Late 
Potentials", Proc. Computers in Cardiology 1992, pp. 159 - 
162, the use of a non-recursive, monotone, binomial, high-pass 
filter for detecting late potentials is proposed. In US patent 4 422 459 is described a technic for
