<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a securing system with a drive-in plug (2) in the axial bore (5) of which engages a drive-in pin (1) during the driving-in process. The pin (1) makes it possible to drive a plastic plug (2) into masonry (8) without preliminary drilling in order, for instance, to secure an insulating board (9) to the wall surface (11).

A fixing system having a drive-in plug (2) for 
fixing insulating panels (9) or other articles to 

masonry (8) comprising aerated concrete or similar 
material without pre-drilling, characterized in that 

during the driving-in operation a drive-in ram (1) is 
inserted into the drive-in plug (2), which has an axial 

bore (5), and bears against the drive-in plug (2) in 
the axial direction, and the drive-in plug (2) has a 

tip (12) pointing in the driving-in direction. 
A fixing system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the tip (12) is in the form of a 

cone having an outer surface (13) forming an angle of 
less than 90Â°, viewed in cross-section. 
A fixing system according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the tip (12) consists of solid 

material and the drive-in plug (2) has a cylindrical 
axial bore (5) extending to the basal face (7) of the 

tip. 
A fixing system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the drive-in plug (2, 22) 

is manufactured from plastics as a one-piece injection-moulded 
part. 
A fixing system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the drive-in ram (1) 

rests on the bottom face (7, 77) of the axial bore (5, 
55) during the driving-in operation. 
A fixing system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a drive-in head (3) or 

other shank enlargement of the drive-in ram (1) bears  
 

against the periphery (4) of the opening of the axial 
bore (5). 
A fixing system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the diameter of the 

drive-in ram (1) is smaller than the diameter of the 
axial bore (5). 
A fixing system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the drive-in plug (21, 

22) has a bowed resilient flange (10) which projects 
laterally from the edge (4) of the opening of the axial 

bore (5). 
A fixing system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the drive-in plug (2, 22) 

driven into masonry (8) is reinforced by a core 
inserted in the axial bore (5, 55) thereof.
