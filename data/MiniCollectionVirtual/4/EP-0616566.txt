<ABSTRACT>
In a calibration method for an industrial robot (2-6), a calibration tool (8) supported by the robot hand (6) is brought into contact with pairwise opposite side surfaces of a calibration body (7) with a known edge length. Thereafter, the output signals from the position transducers of the robot axes are read and stored. This method is repeated a plurality of times with different robot configurations. Thereafter, the calibration parameters of the robot are calculated starting from the kinematic equations of the robot, a model of the relationship between axial position and position transducer signal, the known edge lengths of the calibration body, and the read and stored position transducer signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for calibration of a 
number of movement axes of an industrial robot, which has a 
plurality of movement axes with a position transducer for 
each one of the axes which is adapted to supply an output 
signal which defines the current position of the axis, and a 
robot hand for supporting a tool. A typical industrial robot is previously known from US-A-3 
909 600 and US-A-3 920 972. Such a robot has a stand which 
is rotatably arranged on a foot and which supports a first 
robot arm which is rotatable in relation to the stand. In 
the outer end of this arm, and rotatable in relation 
thereto, a second robot arm is arranged. In its outer end 
this second arm supports a hand which is provided with a 
tool attachment and which is rotatable in two or three 
degrees of freedom in relation to the other arm. The robot 
is provided with control equipment for controlling the 
position and orientation of the robot hand. For each one of 
the above-mentioned axes of rotation, servo equipment 
comprising a driving motor and a position transducer is 
provided, the position transducer delivering a signal which  
 
is a measure of the angle of rotation of the current axis in 
relation to a reference position. To the servo system of 
each axis there is supplied a desired value for the angle of 
rotation of the axis, and the driving motor of the axis 
causes the robot to move in the current axis until the 
angular position indicated by the position transducer of the 
axis corresponds to the desired value supplied to the servo 
system. For the position and orientation of the robot hand to 
correspond to the desired position and orientation, the 
mechanical structure of the robot and the data which 
describe it must be known with a high accuracy. This means 
that it is not sufficient for the nominal robot model to be 
known but also the individual deviations from the nominal 
model must be known. These deviations may be: variations in 
arm lengths, deviations in the orientations of the axes of 
rotation of the joints, and lateral displacements (offset) 
of the axes. These deviations arise in the manufacture of 
the different mechanical components and in the assembly of 
these. To this is also to be added that the angle indicated 
by the position transducer of an axis must with great 
accuracy correspond to the actual angle of rotation of that 
mechanical part of the robot which is controlled with the 
aid of the axis in question. Because of difficulties in carrying out the calibration in a
