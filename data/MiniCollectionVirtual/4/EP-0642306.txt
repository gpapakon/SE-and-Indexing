<ABSTRACT>
A flaying tool with a revolving blade has a driving motor (2) which drives a rotary guided revolving blade (4) mounted between two halves (12, 12') of a blade housing (1) by means of a mechanism (3). In order to obtain a compact and lightweight design, the mechanism (3) has a belt drive (6) with a driving wheel (11) directly or indirectly driven by the driving motor (2) and a blade bearing wheel (15) rotatively mounted between the housing halves (12, 12') and driven by a belt (24).

A flaying tool with a revolving blade which has a driving motor (2) which drives a rotary 
guided revolving blade (4) mounted between two halves (12,12') of a blade housing (1) 

by means of a mechanism (3), 
characterised in that
 the mechanism (3) has a belt drive 
(6) with a driving wheel (11) directly or indirectly driven by the driving motor (2) and a 

blade bearing wheel (15) rotatably mounted between the housing halves (12,12') and 
driven by a belt (24) and in that furthermore the revolving blade (4) and the axis of 

revolution of the driving motor (2) are within the one plane. 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the 
blade bearing wheel (15) has at least one and preferentially several drivers arranged 

distributed about its circumference. 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that the 
heads of cheese head screws (18) which pass through openings (20) in the revolving 

blade (4) serve as drivers. 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the blade bearing wheel (15) has a hub (16) mounted rotatably on a bearing pin (14) 

and in that the belt (24) of the belt drive (6) is driven by means of this hub (16) directly 
or by means of an attached belt wheel (17).  

 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in Claim 3 and 4, characterised in that 
the belt wheel (17) is located on a shoulder on the hub (16) and held by means of cheese 

head screws (18) distributed about the circumference and penetrating a collar (19) of the 
hub (16). 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that the 
bearing pin (14) is permanently press-fitted into one of the housing halves (12) and the 

other housing half (12') is screwed on at an exact clearance by means of a clamping 
screw (21) and in that the clearance between the housing halves (12,12') is defined by 

bearing surfaces (22) of bearing pin (14) and housing half (12'). 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the housing halves (12,12') have guide beads (23) for the revolving blade (4) at least 

partially concentric with the bearing pin (14) and revolving at a clearance from same. 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in that after 
undoing the clamping screw (21) and removing the housing half (12'), the revolving 

blade (4) rests easily changeable without special fastening on the blade bearing wheel 
(15). 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the 
driving wheel (11) of the belt drive (6) is rotatably mounted together with a bevel gear 

(5') between two bearings (9,9') arranged in the blade housing (1) and in that the bevel 
gear (5') operates together with a second bevel gear (5) driven by the driving motor (2).  

 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in that the 
driving motor (2) with the second bevel gear (5) and the bearing (9) adjacent to the first 

bevel gear (5') are accommodated in a part of the blade housing (1) which is connected 
together as one piece. 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in Claim 10, characterised in that the 
one-piece housing part of the blade housing (1) is continued in one piece in a centre wall 

(8) and in that the housing half (12) in which the bearing pin (14) is mounted is screwed 
to this centre wall (8) and in that one of the bearings (9') for the driving wheel (11) is 

also provided in this housing half (12). 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, characterised in 
that the belt drive (6) has a toothed belt (24) and in that the driving wheel (11) and the 

blade bearing wheel (15) have matched teeth about their circumference. 
A flaying tool with a revolving blade as claimed in Claim 12, characterised in that the 
driving wheel (11) is provided with two side rims (25) for belt guidance.
