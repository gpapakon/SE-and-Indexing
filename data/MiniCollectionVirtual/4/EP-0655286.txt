<ABSTRACT>
A sheet bending apparatus comprising a first fixed member 13 
having a clamping surface 14, a clamping anvil member 17 for 

holding a workpiece S in position and a second bending member 
16. The first and second members 13, 16 have intermeshing 

integral projections 23, 27 with arcuate slots 24 or openings 
28. A hinge pin 29 extends through the openings 28 and the 

arcuate slots 24 so that the hinge pin 29 is guided along the 
slots 24 such that the contacting portion 31 of the second 

member 16 remains substantially in the same position relative 
to the workpiece S. A handle member 19 for manipulating the 

clamping anvil member 17 is constructed to minimize the 
stresses thereon and to maximize the strength thereof. A 

stabilizing assembly 56, 60 - 66 is associated with the legs 
55 on which the clamping apparatus is mounted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sheet bending apparatus 
according to the preamble of claim 1. In recent years, various structures have been 
provided to form a portable sheet bending apparatus for 
bending metal or plastic sheets such as are used in siding on 
homes and buildings; see US-A-3,161,223, 3,481,173, 
3,482,427, 3,559,444, 3,817,075, 3,872,755 and 4,321,817. Such apparatus comprise a fixed member on which the 
sheet is clamped and a movable bending member for bending the 
sheet. A major problem with respect to such sheet bending 
apparatus is the tendency of the bending member to move 
relative to the portion of the sheet being bent and thereby 
mar the surface of the sheet. In US-A-3,161,223, the tendency to mar the surface 
of the sheet material was minimized by having the 
intermeshing integral projection between the fixed member and 
bending member which extend longitudinally and define the 
hinge that connects the bending member with the fixed member 
having the clamping surface, positioned so that all portions 
of the projections do not extend above the plane of the 
surface of the members when the surfaces are substantially 
aligned. US-A-3,481,174 and 3,482,427 were directed to an 
arrangement which included a floatable compensator on the 
bending member which engages the sheet material and as the 
bending member is swung to bend the sheet pivots so that the 
contact with the sheet material is maintained.  
 A sheet bending apparatus with the features of the 
preamble to claim 1 is known from US-A-4,557,132. It is an object of the present invention to amend 
the preknown apparatus and which is relatively light in 
weight, portable and low in price. The invention is defined in claim 1. The dependent 
claims show further developments. Briefly, the fixed and movable bending members each 
have substantially the entire length of the longitudinal 
edges thereof formed with longitudinally spaced intermeshing 
integral projections. The projections on the bending member 
have a plurality of aligned openings and the projections on 
the fixed member have a plurality of aligned openings in the 
form of slots. A hinge pin extends through the openings of 
said bending member and the slots of the fixed member. The 
slots have a configuration such that as the bending member is 
moved relative to the fixed member to bend a workpiece, the 
hinge pin is guided along said slots such that the 
contracting portion of the bending member remains 
substantially in the same position relative to the workpiece.

a base (15),
 
a plurality of C-shaped members (10) positioned on said 

base (15) at longitudinally spaced points,

(11) fixed to said base (15) and an upper arm (12) spaced 
from and overlying said lower arm (11),

substantially the entire length of the longitudinal edges 
thereof formed with longitudinally spaced intermeshing

member (13),

contacting portion (31) spaced from the projections (27),
  
 

said workpiece contact surface (31) being fixed relative 
to said hinge pin (29),

confines of the tubular body of the handle member. 
The sheet bending apparatus set forth in any of claims 1 
to 3 wherein said slots (24) have a configuration such 

that as the second member (16) is moved relative to said 
first member (13) to bend a workpiece (S), the hinge pin 

(29) is guided along said slots (24) such that the 
contacting portion (31) of said second member (16) 

remains substantially in the same position relative to 
the workpiece (S) during the bending operation.  

 
The sheet bending apparatus set forth in any of claims 1 
to 4 including a stabilizing assembly which comprises

and the positioning of this apparatus relative to 
the legs and rails of the stabilizing assembly 

produce a moment which is counteracted by the stabilizing 
assembly in connection with the floor where the apparatus 

is placed, yet when bending thicker metal, the force 
necessary for bending is not totally counteracted by such  

 
moment, so that the bending can only be achieved when the 

operator places a foot on the longitudinal rail (62)
