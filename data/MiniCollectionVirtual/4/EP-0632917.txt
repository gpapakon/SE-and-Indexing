comprising, in combination: 


two columns of fixed horizontal shelves (56) secured at each 
side to two vertical supports (61, 62) welded at their ends to 

upper and lower parts of the cabinet and at least one movable 
shelf for each column; 
means for supporting each stack of newspapers on its shelf; 
means for relative displacement and guidance of each discharge 
assembly (76) for the upper newspaper from a stack of 

newspapers relative to the shelf supporting said stack; 
means for guiding the newspaper forming a guide path from the 
edge of the stack from which it is removed, to the receptacle 

of the cabinet, and in that 
each column (54 or 55) of shelves comprises at least one fixed 
shelf (56) adjustable in height by a plurality of securement 

holes provided on the fixed vertical supports (61, 62), and a 
movable shelf (88) disposed at the base of the column, 

displaceable from a lower loading position to an upper 
position in which the stack of newspapers is exhausted. 
Vending machine according to claim 1, characterised in 
that each fixed shelf is formed from a horizontal plate (57) 

and mutually facing adjustable L-shaped lateral flanges (72, 
73), horizontal portions of the flanges bearing on the 

horizontal plate (57) by a counter plate (76), the vertical 
portions of the flanges comprising at least one hole for 

securement to the adjacent vertical support. 
Vending machine according to claim 2, characterised in 
that each shelf comprises moreover vertical corner members 

provided on at least one portion of the internal vertical rear 
edge of each of the flanges (72, 73) and adjustable in 

position by screw means movable along an opening. 
Vending machine according to one of claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the horizontal portions of the flanges 

are cut out in the form of staggered teeth (81). 
Vending machine according to one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that the counter plate (76) and the 

horizontal plate (57) of the shelf comprise an opening for the 
passage of a micro-contact (80) disposed below the horizontal 

plate. 
Vending machine according to one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the lateral flanges (72, 73) comprise 

vertical extensions that are adjustable in height.  

 
Vending machine according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that a movable shelf also comprises: 


four recesses in its plate for the passage of four vertical 
lateral guides (90) fixed at the top on inverted adjustable 

flanges (91, 92) turned downwardly and applied to the plate of 
the fixed shelf immediately above by a gripping counter plate; 
two vertical rear guides (94, 95) held by heels and passing 
through the gripping counter plate and the counter plate (76) 

of the movable shelf; 
a thickness plate (101) disposed between the counter plate 
(76) and the lower plate of the movable shelf; 
means for securement on bushes (102, 103) movable 
longitudinally relative to the vertical supports (61, 62) of 

the columns; 
return springs (104, 105) automatically to raise the shelf 
again into the upper position upon exhaustion of the stack. 
Vending machine according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that it also comprises, in combination with 

each stationary shelf (56), an assembly for discharge of the 
upper newspaper (76) of the stack of newspapers, arranged 

horizontally and secured on a slider displaceable vertically 
along a vertical guide means.  

 
Vending machine according to claim 8, characterised in 
that it also comprises an automatic displacement and return 

means comprising a central electromechanical control actuator 
(157), one cable per column of shelves which on the one hand 

passes freely through holes (155) in the sliders, combined 
with return pulleys and drive members (156) secured on the 

cable at a distance equal to the allowable height of the stack 
of newspapers and which, on the other hand, is secured at its 

end to a movable shelf (88) for lowering the movable shelf 
(88).
