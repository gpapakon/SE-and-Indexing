<ABSTRACT>
An improved clipper (212) for use in a packaging 
device (210) for filing flexible casing (224) with 

pumpable product, the clipper sequentially operating to 
gather the casing, apply spaced double clips to the 

casing, sever the connection between adjacent clips, and 
to then discharge the packaged link from the device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to double clippers for
continuously forming link product. In particular, the
double clippers are suitable for use with a packaging
device for filling formed and sealed tubular materials
with pumpable products such as food products and for
attaching double metal clips to the casing at intervals
thereby enclosing or sealing the product in link form.Various pumpable products, such as food products,
and especially sausage or cheese, are packaged in
tubular materials by attaching metal slips at spaced
intervals thereby sealing and closing product within the
tubular materials. US-A-3,383,754 discloses a device
especially adapted for applying U-shaped metal clips
about casing. Specifically, this patent teaches the use
of a punch for driving a U-shaped metal clip down a
channel against a die to thereby form the clip about
gathered casing retained at the bottom of the clip
channel.US-A-3,543,378 discloses the use of a pair of
clippers arranged in tandem and cooperative with opposed
movable casing gathering plates that define a pair of
clip channels. The gathering plates move in opposition
to each other to gather casing material into a
constricted form or mass. Two U-shaped metal clips are
then driven by punches about the gathered casing to seal
the ends of the casing. A knife then cuts the casing
between the clips to thereby separate the links defined
by the clipped casing. US-A-3,583,056 discloses another
clip attachment apparatus wherein a movable jaw pivots
against a fixed jaw to gather the casing in a
constricted region prior to attachment of a clip about
the casing. Other patents disclose various combinations 
of gathering mechanisms for gathering casing prior to
attachment of a clip or clips including US-A-3,783,583,
US-A-4,001,926, and in US Reissue Patent No. 30,196.To increase the efficiency and utility of such
clipping devices, it has been suggested in US-A-3,795,085
to mount a single clipper at a work station of
a rotating table. A filled bag or casing which is to be
clipped is placed on a nozzle at a first work station
associated with the table. The casing material is then
clamped as the table rotates to a second work station.
Air in the casing is then evacuated through a vacuum
system at a third station and ultimately, upon further
rotation of the table to the clip work station, a clip
is attached to the casing to seal the casing.In US-A-4,578,928 discloses yet another variation
on this theme wherein a circular table is provided for
gathering casing material fitted about a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A dual clipper, for attachment simultaneously of
two spaced U-shaped metal clips (406,408,409) about

casing, for the formation of stuffed chub products, the
clipper (212) comprising:


a mounting unit (260) defining two parallel clip
channels (262), defining a window (400) into the clip

channels for receiving separated clips and a chamber
(404) aligned with the window, and defining a throat

(227) for receiving casing, the clip channels defining
two partial pathways for clips driven by hereinafter

defined punches (266);
die means (281) along the clip channels for
deforming clips driven in the clip channels to the die

means by the punches;
dual clip punches (266) movable in the clip
channels past the window and chamber to the die means,

for driving clips to the die means;
punch drive means (268) for driving the clip
punches in the clip channels;
a short rail (402) extending between the clip
channels in the chamber aligned with the window and

defining an open space in each of the clip channels that
are aligned with the rail; and
clip rail means (264) for directing clips through
the window and chamber into the clip channels, the clip

rail means directing clips into the clip channels from
one direction only,

characterised in that the dual clipper additionally
comprises a gathering mechanism (285) defining the

throat (227) in association with the clip channels
(262), the gathering mechanism being movable to a closed

position to close the throat, for the gathering of
casing for clip attachment; 
gathering drive means (272) for driving the
gathering mechanism to the closed position; and
clip pusher means (384) (a) for pushing clips (409)
along the clip rail means (264) towards the window

(400), (b) for maintaining the clips under forward-directed
force during portions of the times of clipper

operation, and (c) for thereby suspending clips (406,
408) in each of the open spaces of the two clip channels

(262) by the forward-directed force in position to be
driven to the die means (281) by the clip punches (266),

whereby the clips (406,408) are suspended in the
open spaces of the clip channels without need of an

underlying bridging mechanism.
A dual clipper as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
height of the chamber (404) above the short rail (402)

is sized so as to prevent vertical movement and
subsequent locking or wedging of the clips (406,408,409)

in the chamber.
A dual clipper as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein
the short rail (402) has an upper surface which is

shaped to receive trapezoidal clips.
A dual clipper as in claim 1, 2 or 3 further
comprising means for controlling the pushing action of

the clip pusher means (384) and the driving action of
the punch drive means (268) such that forward-directed

force on clips (409) on the clip rail means (264) is
maintained except as released only during times in which

the clip punches (266) are past the window (400). 
A dual clipper as in any preceding claim, wherein
the clip pusher means (384) includes a clipleg-contacting

pawl (392) and reciprocating means (390,394)
for intermittently driving the pawl to push clips (409)

along the clip rail means (264).
A dual clipper as in claim 5, wherein the clip
pusher means (384) further includes a unidirectionally-rotatable

wheel means (398) in contact with the clips
(409) on the clip rail means (264).
A dual clipper as in any preceding claim, wherein
the short rail (402) has a length dimension, in the

direction of clip movement along the short rail, of an
integer number of clips (406,408,409).
A dual clipper as claimed in claim 7, wherein the
integer number is seven.
