<ABSTRACT>
Improved paper used in the printing industry and 
similar industries, made of a vegetal flexible laminar 

support coated on one of its sides by a film made of a 
plastic material which is in turn a support for the 

fixation of a printing material which is transferred 
through heat onto the surface of an object, together with 

the plastic film which protects such a printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This present invention refers to an improved paper 
mainly conceived to be used in the printing industry and 
similar industries, and even for color photocopiers. The new feature of the paper lies in its manufacturing 
proccess and the improvements as concerns its applications 
with regard to other known papers at present used in the 
commerce and/or industry. Every and all of the improvements of the paper object 
of this present invention are attained through a simple 
manufacturing proccess, thus being highly competitive 
within market. According to this invention, the paper is made of a 
laminar support in turn made of a vegetal flexible 
material. The above laminar support has a plastic film adhered 
to one side which in turns acts as the fixation support for 
a further material -e.g., either a liquid in ink form or a 
powdered material being the printing proccess with the 
latter carried out by color photocopying. Thus, the drawing printed on the support of the 
plastic film on its visible side is furthermore used for a 
given printing application which might for example be a 
transfer work onto the surface of an object. The powdered material is a printing material used on 
reprography and xerography. Since the plastic film is a support, it is furthermore 
the basic substance wherein the powdered material may be 
fully or partially integrated or the printing ink duly 
dispersed. When such a paper is applied at least to a transfer, 
the plastic film melts and protects the sketch or drawing 
transferred onto the surface of the object, since it is 
thus protected by the plastic film which coats the surface 
of the object itself. This is very important since the referred film 
deposited onto the surface of the drawing protects it and  
 
proveides for a longer life by preventing deterioration. In the aim to provide for an easy understanding not 
only of the manufacturing proccess but instead also of the 
use of such a paper object of this present invention, an 
embodiment of the same is referred herebelow, being such an 
embodiment merely enunciative and not limitative in any 
case whatsoever, all of which is shown in the attached 
drawings wherein: Figure 1 illustrates an extended view of a portion of 
the paper object of this present invention. Figure 2 illustrates a sectional view following line 
II-II shown on Figure 1. A concerns drawings, the following items are shown: 
paper 1 object of the present invention, having a support 
layer 2 made of a flexible vegetal material. The referred layer 2 has
