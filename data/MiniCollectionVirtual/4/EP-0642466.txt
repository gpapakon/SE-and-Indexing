<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved method and apparatus 
for preparing low-concentration polysilicate microgels, i.e., aqueous solutions having 
an active silica concentration of generally less than about 1.0 wt.%, which are 
formed by the partial gelation of an alkali metal silicate or a polysilicate, such as 
sodium polysilicate, having in its most common form one part Na₂O to 3.3 parts 
SiO₂ by weight. The microgels, which are referred to as "active" silica in contrast to 
commercial colloidal silica, comprise solutions of from 1 to 2 nm diameter silica 
particles which have a surface area of at least about 1000 m²/g. The particles are 
linked together during preparation, i.e., during partial gelation, to form aggregates 
which are arranged into three-dimensional networks and chains. A critical aspect of 
the invention is the ability to produce the microgels within a reasonable time period, 
i.e., not longer than about 15 minutes until the microgel is ready for use, without the 
risk of solidification and with minimum formation of undesirable silica deposits 
within the processing equipment. Polysilicate microgels produced according to the 
invention are particularly useful in combinations with water soluble cationic 
polymers as a drainage and retention aid in papermaking. Methods of producing activated silica sols are known from e.g., GB-A- 1 044 019 and 'Chemical Engineering Progress', Vol. 1, No. 1, 1947, p 27-33. The present invention is an improved method and apparatus for 
continuously preparing a low-concentration polysilicate microgel which comprises: 
(a) simultaneously introducing a first stream comprising a water soluble silicate 
solution and a second stream comprising a strong acid having a pKa less than 6 into 
a mixing zone where the streams converge at an angle of not less than 30 deg and at 
a rate sufficient to produce a Reynolds number of at least about 4000 and a 
resulting silicate/acid mixture having a silica concentration in the range of from 
about 1.0 to 6.0 wt.% and a pH in the range of from 2 to 10.5; (b) aging the silicate/acid mixture for a period of time sufficient to achieve a 
desired level of partial gelation, usually for at least 10 seconds but not more than 
about 15 minutes; and (c) diluting the aged mixture to a silica concentration of not greater than about 1.0 
wt.% whereby gelation is stabilized. For best results, the silica concentration of the water soluble silicate 
starting solution is in the range of from 2 to 10 wt.% silica, and the

An improved method for continuously preparing a polysilicate 
microgel in which the microgel comprises a solution of from 1 to 2 nm diameter 

silica particles having a surface area of at least about 1000 m²/g which are linked 
together into individual chains to form three-dimensional network structures and 

comprises: 

(a) simultaneously introducing a first stream comprising a water soluble silicate 
solution and a second stream comprising a strong acid having a pKa less than 6 into 

a mixing zone where the streams converge at an angle of not less than 30 deg and at 
a rate sufficient to produce a Reynolds number in the mixing zone of at least about 

4000 and a resulting silicate/acid mixture having a silica concentration in the range 
of from 1 to 6 wt.% and a pH in the range of from 2 to 10.5; 
(b) aging the silicate/acid mixture for a period of time sufficient to achieve a 
desired level of partial gelation, but not longer than 15 minutes; and 
(c) diluting the aged mixture to a silica concentration of not greater than 1.0 wt.%. 
The method of Claim 1 where the silica concentration is from 1.5 
to 3.5 wt.% and the pH is from 7 to 10. 
An apparatus for continuously producing a stable aqueous 
polysilicate microgel which comprises: 


(a) a first reservoir for containing a water soluble silicate solution; 
(b) a second reservoir for containing a strong acid having a pKa of less than 6; 
(c) a mixing device having a first inlet which communicates with said first reservoir, 
a second inlet arranged at an angle of at least 30 deg with respect to said first inlet 

which communicates with said second reservoir, and an exit;

device for pumping a stream of silicate solution from said first reservoir into said 

first inlet and, a first control means for controlling the concentration of silica within 
the range of from 1 to 6 wt.% in said silicate solution while said solution is being 

pumped; 
(e) a second pumping means located between said second reservoir and said mixing 
device for pumping a stream of acid from said second reservoir into said second 

inlet at a rate relative to the rate of said first pumping means sufficient to produce a 
Reynolds number within said mixing device of at least 4000 in the region where said 

streams converge whereby said silicate and said acid are thoroughly mixed;

of said acid into said mixing device for controlling the pH of the silicate/acid 

mixture in the range of from 2 to 10.5; 
(g) a receiving tank. 
(h) an elongated transfer loop which communicates with the exit of said mixing
