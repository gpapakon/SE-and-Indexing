<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and a device for treating pieces of rubber and/or plastic reinforced with metallic materials and/or fabric fibres, in particular preshredded steel radial ply tyres. The process is characterised in that the pieces of rubber and/or plastic (7) are intermittently clamped between two pressure elements (1, 2), of which preferably the pressure body (2) has a grid-shaped surface structure, with a compressive stress of over 5 t and are subjected to a shear stress by a relative movement of at least one of the pressure elements. The pressure elements preferably comprise a concavely designed pressure plate (2) and a convexly designed pressure body (1), the pressure body being such that it can be advanced intermittently by means of a gear mechanism towards the pressure plate and can be moved along the latter with play.
