<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to new isolated
immunoglobulins which are devoid of light polypeptide
chains. These immunoglobulins do not consist in the
degradation products of immunoglobulins composed of
both heavy polypeptide and light polypeptide chains
but to the contrary, the invention defines a new
member of the family of the immunoglobulins,
especially a new type of molecules capable of being
involved in the immune recognition. Such
immunoglobulins can be used for several purposes,
especially for diagnosis or therapeutical purposes
including protection against pathological agents or
regulation of the expression or activity of proteins.Up to now the structure proposed for
immunoglobulins consists of a four-chain model
referring to the presence of two identical light
polypeptide chains (light chains) and two identical
heavy polypeptide chains (heavy chains) linked
together by disulfide bonds to form a y- or T-shaped
macromolecules. These chains are composed of a
constant region and a variable region, the constant
region being subdivided in several domains. The two
heavy polypeptide chains are usually linked by
disulphide bounds in a so-called "hinge region"
situated between the first and second domains of the
constant region.Among the proteins forming the class of the
immunoglobulins, most of them are antibodies and
accordingly present an antigen binding site or several
antigen binding sites.According to the four-chain model, the antigen
binding site of an antibody is located in the variable
domains of each of the heavy and light chains, and 
requires the association of the heavy and the light
chains variable domains.For the definition of these four-chain model
immunoglobulins, reference is made to Roitt. I et al
(Immunology-second-Edition Gower Medical Publishing
USA, 1989). Reference is especially made to the part
concerning the definition of the four-chain
immunoglobulins, their polypeptidic and genetic
structures, the definition of their variable and
constant regions and the obtention of the fragments
produced by enzymatic degradation according to well
known techniques.The inventors have surprisingly established that
different molecules can be isolated from animals which
naturally produce them, which molecules have
functional properties of immunoglobulins these
functions being in some cases related to structural
elements which are distinct from those involved in the
function of four-chain immunoglobulins due for
instance to the absence of light chains.The invention relates to two-chain model
immunoglobul
