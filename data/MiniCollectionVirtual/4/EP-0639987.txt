<ABSTRACT>
A steriliser apparatus includes a chamber in which an article or material to be sterilised is placed and a sterilising gas or vapour is then introduced into the chamber to contact and sterilise the article or material. The free sterilant gas or vapour in the chamber is removed and the article or material subjected to a desorbing step during which the concentration of sterilising gas or vapour in the chamber is measured by a sampling device in which a sample of chamber atmosphere is exposed to microwave radiation and the absorption spectrum monitored to determine the concentration of sterilising gas or vapour present in the chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the sterilising of articles
to kill or destroy bacteria or other unwanted or toxic
bodies. The invention is of particular utility in the
sterilising of equipment used for medical or surgical
purposes, but may have other applications, for example in
industry. This invention also relates to the desorption of
gas or vapour from articles or material, and extends in
particular to apparatus and methods for measuring the
presence or concentration of sterilant, or the gas or vapour
to be desorbed in the above sterilising and desorbing
techniques. Such apparatus and methods may be used to
control sterilising and desorbing apparatus and improve
their operation.It is of course well-known to sterilise metal surgical
instruments by steam and it has also been common practice to
sterilise various articles in sterilising liquids. High
temperature steam sterilising is simple and effective for
certain metal objects, but has limitations and
disadvantages, for example it is inefficient in sterilising
any object within a sealed package, and the high
temperatures involved may cause degradation of plastic
articles. The use of sterilising liquids also has
limitations, for example air bubbles may be trapped within 
the object thus preventing full effectiveness, and it may be
difficult or impossible to remove all trace of the liquid
afterwards.It has also been common practice to sterilise medical
or surgical equipment by means of a toxic gas and many
existing sterilisers in hospital use, for example, involve
contacting the articles with Ethylene Oxide in a sealed
sterilising chamber. Ethylene Oxide is an extremely
effective bactericide, and is effective not only for metal
objects such as surgical implements, but also relatively
delicate instruments and equipment, including synthetic
plastics. The gas is effective at medium or low temperatures
and thus the effects of high temperatures on degrading
materials can be avoided. The gas penetrates or permeates
plastic wrappings and can thus be used to sterilise prepackaged
objects.Ethylene Oxide is, however, extremely toxic to human
beings and after its use for sterilising it is important
that steps be taken to remove all traces, as far as
possible. To this end it is known to flush out the interior
of the sterilising chamber or autoclave with fresh air after
the sterilising gas has been extracted. It has also been
proposed to "pulse" or vary the pressure of the flushing air
during the flushing operation.One of the problems involved is that the Ethylene Oxide
is
