<ABSTRACT>
For an electric motor, particularly for driving a fan impeller of a heating or air-conditioning system of a motor vehicle, it is provided that the support has a motor holder and an adaptor which can be fitted to the pole ring of the electric motor, and that supporting elements which are in the form of blocks and are made of elastomeric material are arranged between the adaptor and the motor holder.

<CLAIMS>
A mount for an electric motor (10), particularly for an electric motor for an
impeller of a heating or air conditioning installation of a motor vehicle with several

support elements (24') of rubber elastic material, distributed over the circumference of a
pole ring, wherein the support elements (24') are mounted between an adaptor (23')

fixedly attachable at least in axial direction on the electric motor (10), and a motor support
(22), and wherein also the support elements (24') fixed on the adaptor (23') in an axial

direction and in circumferential direction are connected at least in an axial direction to the
motor support and are disposed in one common radial plane, the said common radial plane

extending at least approximately through the axial centre of gravity of the unit constituted
by the electric motor (10) and the element driven by it, particularly the fan impeller (12),

the adaptor (23') consisting of a plurality of fingers (29') extending along generatrices of
the pole ring (21) of the electric motor (10), characterised in that the fingers at the end

remote from the driven element are connected to one another by means of bracing (40)
extending crosswise to the motor shaft (11) and, at their ends remote from the bracing

(40), merge into a ring (38) surrounding the pole ring (21) of the electric motor (10) and
in that the bracing (40) comprises at least one housing (42) for a fixing means which

secures the adaptor in an axial direction and in a peripheral direction on the electric motor.
A mount according to claim 1, characterised in that the support elements (24')
have an axial length which corresponds to one-third up to about one-quarter of the axial

length of the pole ring (10).
A mount according to claim 2, characterised in that the radial thickness of the
support elements (24') corresponds to about two-thirds up to about three-quarters of their

axial length.
A mount according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the adaptor (23')
and the motor support (22) can be fitted into one another in an axial direction, the support

elements (24') provided on the adaptor enter into and become locked in recesses (34) in
the motor support. 
A mount according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the motor support
(22) is provided with axially defined recesses (34) which, in shell-like fashion, surround

a support element (24').
A mount according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the support
elements (24') have substantially radially projecting catches (37) each of which engages

a cavity (36) in a recess (34).
A mount according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the support
elements (24') comprise a rubber elastic base body (43) which is provided with a slider

element (44) associated with the holder.
A mount according to claim 7, characterised in that the slider element (44) has a
sloping sliding surface (45) and a catch (37').
A mount according to claim 1, characterised in that the adaptor is a plastic
moulded part.
