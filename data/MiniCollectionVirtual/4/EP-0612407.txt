<ABSTRACT>
A metering device for multiphase fluid, for example, crude oil, comprises a  gamma  or X-ray densiometer incorporating windows for the metering radiation of boron carbide. The boron carbide windows can be provided by a sleeve guiding the fluid flow, the sleeve (51) being reinforced by a thin external layer (52) of carbon fibre embedded in expoxy resin. Alternatively, a steel tube (26) receiving the fluid flow has aligned transverse apertures (47) containing plugs (49) of boron carbide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a metering device for a fluid. Particularly in the context of oil extraction systems, 
it is required to measure the proportions of the components 
in a multi-phase fluid flow, for example, a crude oil flow 
containing gas and/or water in varying proportions. It has 
been proposed in WO 90/13859 (FD20) to provide a mixer 
apparatus for fluids incorporating a choke or venturi, and to 
associate measuring or metering equipment with the venturi to 
determine mass flow rates of the fluid phases flowing through 
it. Such metering equipment can include a densiometer 
employing a γ or X-ray source located at one side of the 
fluid flow for transmitting its radiation transversely 
through the fluid to a radiation sensor or detector located 
at the other side of the fluid flow. The use of a γ or X-ray source and detector presents a 
problem for such metering equipment in that the tubing within 
which the fluid flow is confined should be highly transparent 
to the metering radiation whilst being resistant to the fluid 
flow and having necessary strength and rigidity. The first 
of these requirements effectively precludes the use of steel 
tubing and it has been proposed in EP 0 236 623 to employ 
beryllium as the material of the wall of the tube across 
which the radiation is transmitted. The toxicity of 
beryllium however presents manufacturing problems. The present invention accordingly relates to a metering 
device in which radiation from a source is transmitted 
through a multiphase or other fluid to be entered to a sensor 
or detector responsive to the radiation from the source. The 
invention is concerned with the provision of a device of this 
kind in which tubing guiding a flowing fluid has appropriate 
mechanical and physical characteristics and does not unduly 
attenuate the radiation to be transmitted across it. The invention accordingly provides a metering device of  
 
the kind described in which the material of the tubing wall, 
or other tubing portion through which the radiation is 
transmitted, is boron carbide (B4C). Boron carbide has 
appropriate absorption (or transparency) characteristics 
for γ or X-rays and is not adversely affected by exposure to 
such multiphase fluids as are encountered in oil production 
systems, namely, oil mixed with variable proportions of gas 
and/or water. Boron carbide is not however ideal in respect of its 
mechanical properties. The invention accordingly also 
provides a metering device of the kind described in which the 
tubing comprises
