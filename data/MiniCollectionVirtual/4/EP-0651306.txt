It is described an apparatus (1) for preparing solutions 
substantially consisted of from at least one solvent and at least a 

solute that comprises in combination at least one measuring device 
(2) for detectinc the weighs or the pH value of components, at 

least a container (3) containing the solution components and located 
on the measuring device (2), means (5) for metering the solvent 

located above the container (3), at least a vessel (6) for receiving 
the solvent, means (7) for drawing solvent connected to the vessel 

(6) and to the means (5) and provided for moving the solvent into 
the same metering means and operating and control means (4) for 

operating and controlling all the steps and the data related to

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for preparing 
solutions particularly for chemical analysis laboratories. It is known that in all the analysis laboratories of every chemical 
branch, one of the most common operation is the preparation of 
"known titre solutions". This term refers to a mixture conisted of 
an amount measured in a very accurately way of a component 
comprising one or more substances called solute (e.g. liquid or 
solid salt), a volume, measured in the same accurate way, of one or 
more liquids called solvents. In fact, these solutions show a very accurate solid-liquid 
concentration ratio. In order to obtaining the aforementioned solutions it is necessary 
to weigh a sample (the solid can be generally found in a powder-like 
state) and then to transfer it into a glass container (usually 
called "matress") provided with an indentation located on the neck 
and provided for indicating a known volume (e.g. 100 ml or 1 liter). 
Thanks to the shape of the matress, the solvent volume cannot be 
modified and is an established parameter that fixes strictly the 
solute amount. Accordingly, it is very important to be extremely 
accurate during the weighings of the solute.  For example, if someone wishes to obtain a solution of one liter of 
sodium chloride in water having a concentration of 1 gram/liter, it 
is absolutely necessary to weigh one gram of salt. In order to 
obtained what has been just explained, it is essential to use a 
sufficiently accurate scale, to pour the salt little by little on a 
suitable sheet, whose tare has been measured, until the scale 
indicates one grams. If this amount is exceeded, it is necessary to 
take away the excess in order to obtain exactly one gram. At this 
time, it is necessary to pour carefully the salt in the matress for 
not leaving it on the sheet. After that, the solvent is added until 
the level gets to the measuring indentation on the matress neck. 
Obviously, if the indentation is passed by mistake, it is necessary 
to repeat all the process since it is not possible to know the 
effective volume of the solution since the matress has just one 
reference indentation. In view of what has just been described, it can be easily understood 
that the actually used process systems for preparing solutions show 
several drawbacks. For example, all the above described steps are carried out manually 
by an operator who must weigh the small amounts of solute and 
transfer them into the matress without loosing the solvent and pour 
it exactly to the
