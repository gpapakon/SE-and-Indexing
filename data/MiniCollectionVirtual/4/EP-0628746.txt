<ABSTRACT>
Torsional vibration damper comprising an essentially cup-shaped hub ring (1) made of deep-drawn sheet metal, the bottom (2) of which has at least one opening (3) to allow it to be fastened to a machine part (4) that can be subjected to torsional vibrations, the hub ring (1) being connected, with the ability for relative rotation, to at least one inertia ring (6) by means of at least one spring element (5) made from elastomeric material. The bottom (2) is provided with an annular centring collar (7) which extends in the axial direction and which surrounds the outer circumference (8) of the machine part (4), making partial contact with the latter, the centring collar (7) and the bottom (2) being designed in such a way as to merge integrally into one another.

<CLAIMS>
A torsional vibration damper comprising an 
essentially pot-shaped hub ring (1) of deep-drawn sheet 

metal, whose base (2) has at least one opening (3) for 
attachment to a machine part (4) which can be acted upon by 

torsional vibrations, the hub ring (1) being connected by 
means of at least one spring element (5) made of elastomeric 

material to at least one inertia ring (6) so as to be 
relatively rotatable, the base (2) being provided with an 

annular centring collar (7) which extends in the axial 
direction and engages around the outside circumference (8) 

of the machine part (4), and the centring collar (7) and the 
base (2) being designed to merge integrally into one 

another, characterized in that the centring collar (7) 
engages around the outside circumference (8) of the machine 

part (4), resting partially against it, in that the centring 
collar (7) is formed by at least two holding claws (9.1, 

9.2) which are uniformly distributed in the circumferential 
direction and are moulded out of the base (2), in that the 

cutouts (10.1, 10.2) formed by producing the holding claws 
(9.1, 9.2) are closed by seals (11) made of elastomeric 

material, and in that the seals (11) and the spring element 
(5) are designed to merge integrally into one another. 
A torsional vibration damper according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the inertia ring (6) is designed as a 

pulley (12).
