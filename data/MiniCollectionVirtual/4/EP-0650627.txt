<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to an array of
self-adhesive postage stamps presented on a currency
sized release liner to form an assembly that is
dispensable from an automatic teller machine or ATM.Various postage services have determined that it
would be convenient to serve the public with means to
purchase postage stamps through an automatic teller
machine or ATM.The postage stamp itself is a rather complex
device. To meet current user demands it must be
constructed of a face material or backing capable of
accepting high quality printing of complex design
stable under a variety of environmental conditions and
provide an ink cancelable surface, on which
cancellation ink dries rapidly, and which is removable
from its adhesive to meet the needs of stamp
collectors. In addition to being cancelable it should
have at its surface means to detect the stamp so that 
a properly stamped envelope can be cancelled in an
automated cancellation machine.Traditionally, a postage stamp has been
manufactured with a water soluble adhesive. It has
been the desire of the postal service to, no only
convert the adhesive to a self-adhesive or pressure
sensitive adhesive, but to also present the postage
stamps, as part of a laminate construction, which is
dispensable from an automatic teller machine.An automatic teller machine is designed to
dispense currency. Any postage stamp construction to
be dispensable must be dispensable as a laminate of an
array of stamps serving as the facestock or backing, an
interlayer of a self- or pressure-sensitive adhesive
and a continuous release liner which protects the
adhesive until the stamps are peeled therefrom and
still provide performance characteristics which
simulate the currency from which the ATM was configured
to dispense.No characteristic of the classic postage stamp can
be sacrificed, yet the laminate must behave like
currency in an automatic teller machine, otherwise the
ATM will not dispense the product.The first attempt at a automatic teller machine
dispensable stamp construction consisted of an array of
postage stamps formed of a taggant coated polyester
laminated to an acrylic based adhesive which was in
turn laminated to a polyester based release liner.
This arrangement did not meet with public acceptance in
the United States. The reason was attributed to the
environmentally unfriendly nature of its polyester
facestock.A second version featured a 45 pound clear
overcoated paper facestock and paper release liner.
Because of several problems, including thickness of the

<CLAIMS>
An automatic teller machine postage stamp
construction (10) which comprises a sheetlet formed of:


(a) a paper release liner having a top surface
(30) and an opposed undersurface (32), said undersurface

providing a first coefficient of friction;
(b) a plurality of die-cut stamps (14,18) adhered

by an ooze resistant pressure sensitive adhesive (28) to
the top surface (30) of the release liner, each of said

stamps (14,18) formed of a paper (24) having a top surface
and an opposed stamp undersurface, said top surface being

coated with a polymeric coating (22) having a second
coefficient of friction, characterised in that said

pressure sensitive adhesive has a storage modulus greater
than about 10,000 dynes/cm
2
 at a deformation rate of 10
-7

radian/second and said sheetlets have a curl no greater
than 40 mm along any axis, wherein the first coefficient

of friction is of a first amount and the second
coefficient of friction is of a second amount where the

first and second amounts and the difference therebetween
are determined so as to ensure the dispensing of single

sheetlets from an automatic teller machine.
A postage stamp construction as claimed in claim
1 in which the coating (22) on top surface of each stamp

(14,18) contains a means to detect location of the stamp
(14,18) on an envelope, such as zinc orthosilicate.
A postage stamp construction as claimed in claim
1 or 2 in which the coefficient of friction of the top

surface of the stamp (14,18) and the coefficient of
friction of undersurface (32) of the release liner differ 

by at least about 25%.
A postage stamp construction as claimed in claim
1, 2 or 3 in which the undersurface (32) of the release

liner is coated with a polymeric coating, optionally being
acrylic based coating.
A postage stamp construction as claimed in any one
of the previous claims in which the paper forming each

stamp (14,18) has a paper weight of about 56 g/m
2
 and the
paper forming the release liner has a paper weight of

about 50 g/m
2
.
A postage stamp construction as claimed in any one
of the previous claims in which the pressure sensitive

adhesive is an emulsion acrylic adhesive polymer.
A postage stamp construction as claimed in any one
of the previous claims in which the sheetlet has a

thickness of from about 4.3 (0.109 mm) to about 5 mils (0.127 mm), optionally
having a thickness of about 4.6 mils (0.117 mm).
A postage stamp construction according to claim 1,
wherein:


(a) the release liner formed of a paper having a
paper weight of about 50 g/m
2
, and the undersurface of the
release liner providing coefficient of friction of from

about 0.45 to about 0.7;
(b) the plurality of stamps (14,18) individually
adhered by an ooze resistant emulsion acrylic pressure

sensitive adhesive to the release liner, each of the
stamps (14,18) formed of an ink cancellable acrylic coat

(22) applied to a top surface of paper (24) having a paper 
weight of about 56 g/m
2
, said acrylic coating having a
coefficient of friction from about 0.45 to about 0.7 and

containing zinc orthosilicate present in a concentration
sufficient to enable detection of a stamp (14,18) location

on an envelope by a stamp cancellation machine, said paper
(24) further having, on the surface opposed of the top

surface, a water soluble primer in contact with the
pressure sensitive adhesive (28), said pressure sensitive

adhesive (28) being an emulsion acrylic polymer having a
storage modulus of at least 10,000 dynes/cm
2
 at a
deformation rate of 10
-7
 radians/second, said postage
stamps (14,18) being formed by die-cutting a laminate of

top coating, paper, primer and pressure sensitive adhesive
to said release liner, said construction has a thickness

of from about 4.3 to about 5 mils and a curl no greater
than 40 mm.
A postage stamp construction according to any one
of the preceding claims, wherein the first and second

coefficients of friction are greater than 0.45.
A postage stamp construction according to any one
of the preceding claims, wherein the stamp undersurface

provides a water soluble means to enable separation of the
stamp from the pressure sensitive adhesive (28) by soaking

in water.
A postage stamp construction according to any one
of the preceding claims, further including a removable bar

member (20) adapted to enable folding of the sheetlet upon
removal thereof, the bar member (20) separating the

plurality of stamps (14,18) into a first (14) and a second
(18) array of stamps. 
A postage stamp construction according to any one
of the preceding claims, wherein the sheetlet has a

substantially uniform opacity.
