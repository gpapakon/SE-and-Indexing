<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for monitoring and control
of a component connected to an electric power network according
to the precharacterising part of claim 1. Such a
component may, for example, be a filter arranged in a converter
plant for high-voltage direct current for filtering
harmonics or a capacitor bank for generating reactive power.A converter connected to an a.c. network, for example a converter
included in a converter plant for high-voltage direct
current, generates, by its principle of operation, harmonic
currents on its a.c. side and harmonic voltages on its d.c.
voltage side. In this context, in principle, only harmonics
to the fundamental frequency of the a.c. network of the orders
n=kp±1 occur on the a.c. side and of the orders n=kp on
the d.c. voltage side, p being the pulse number of the converter
and k being a positive integer. Harmonics of other
orders may also occur in power networks of this kind, caused
by, for example, unsymmetries between the phases of the a.c.
network. To reduce the stresses originating from the harmonics on
components included in the power network, and to fulfil the
requirements made on the effect on the network and telecommunication
disturbances, shunt-connected filters are therefore
generally installed to limit the propagation of the
disturbances in the power network. Harmonics of a lower order,
for example those which correspond to k = 1 and for 6-pulse
converters also k = 2, are generally filtered through
filters tuned to these harmonics whereas harmonics of a
higher order may be filtered through a high-pass filter. The
filters are composed of passive components, and during the
dimensioning it is also taken into consideration that the
filters on the a.c. side are to serve as members for generating
reactive power. In general, however, the requirements
for generation of reactive power in a converter plant for
high-voltage direct power result in the need to install one
or more further high-voltage capacitor banks on the a.c.
side. In certain cases, it may be necessary to install tuned
filters and high-pass filters also on the d.c. voltage side
of the converter. In a converter plant for high-voltage direct
current, these filters and the capacitor banks constitute
plant components which essentially influence the function,
volume and cost of the plant.The tuned filters are generally designed as series-resonance
circuits, comprising capacitive, inductive and sometimes
also resistive impedance elements, tuned such that, at one
or more of the harmonic
