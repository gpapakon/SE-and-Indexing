<ABSTRACT>
In a device for handling wafer-shaped objects in a handling plane of a local clean room, the aim is to ensure the process stages preceding and succeeding the processing and inspection of the wafer-shaped objects in the conditions of a local clean room using SMIF boxes. According to the invention, the structure of the handling plane (H-H) is in a fixed relationship to a reference plane (E-E) of at least one magazine-indexing device (42) comprising the magazine feed (33) according to their magazine compartments (43) and the wafer-shaped objects therein and is arranged above an intermediate floor (9) which divides the clean room into two superimposed parts (10, 11) in which one component of an airstream from the part (10) above the intermediate floor (9) is directed into the part (11) beneath the intermediate floor (9). The invention is applicable in the manufacture of integrated circuits, especially for handling purposes.

Apparatus for handling disc-shaped objects in a handling
plane of a local clean room which is divided into two

compartments (10, 11) lying one above the other by an
intermediate base (9) provided with openings for air to flow

over and which has a laminar air stream passing through it,
with air outlet openings in its outer wall (12), a magazine

receptacle (33) which is measurably adjustable in height
relative to a handling plane (H-H), at least one device for

indexing compartments (43) of a magazine (42) and disc-shaped
objects (44) contained therein and work stations (5, 6) lying

substantially in the handling plane (H-H) for processing and
inspection purposes, characterised in that the compartment

(10) above the intermediate base (9) contains the handling
plane (H-H) which in structural terms is in a fixed

relationship to a datum plane (E-E) of the indexing device,
and that the laminar air stream is directed onto the outer

wall (12), the air outlet openings (13) of which above the
intermediate base (9) have a smaller total cross-section than

the air outlet openings (14) below the intermediate base (9),
as a result of which an air stream component produced from the

air stream and directed out of the compartment (10) above the
intermediate base (9) into the compartment (11) below the

intermediate base prevents particles produced due to drive
elements in the compartment (11) below the intermediate base

from penetrating into the compartment (10) above the
intermediate base (9).
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that
in the air preparation plant (8), which in a common housing

(16) serving as plenum contains an axial fan (21) and a filter
(23) disposed one after the other in the flow direction

between an inlet opening (17) and an outlet opening (18), the
inlet opening (17) and the axial fan (21) are separated from

the plenum by a tubular casing (24) as far as an air outlet in 
the flow direction, and that the air outlet contains air

baffles which are placed in the air stream and counteract
rotating air stream components.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in that
the air outlet consists of cut-outs (27) in the shape of a

sector of a circle which are provided symmetrically with
respect to the axis of rotation (X-X) of the axial fan (21) by

machining into a plate (26) connected to the casing (24), the
air baffles being placed in these cut-outs so that they are

directed parallel to the blades (25) of the axial fan (21).
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that
the indexing device has an optoelectronic sensor consisting of

a transmitter (38) and a receiver (39) by means of which the
position of the magazine compartments (43) and also of the

disc-shaped objects (44) relative to the datum plane (E-E) is
detected using measurement techniques.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in that
that a measurement beam (41) emanating from the transmitter

(38) and lying with its central ray in the datum plane (E-E)
is guided through between opposing walls (45, 46) containing

the magazine compartments (43) and is directed onto
projections (48) of one of the walls (45, 46) which

projections shade the measurement beam (41), point into the
interior of the magazine (42), form c
ompartments and serve as
support for the disc-shaped objects (44), and that an image of

the magazine compartments (43) and also of the disc-shaped
objects (44) located in the magazine compartments (43) is

produced by a modulation of the measurement (41) due to the
height adjustment in the direction of the magazine

compartments (43) which lie one above the other and thereby
one after the other assume a common position with the datum

plane (E-E). 
Apparatus as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that for positioning of disc-shaped objects

(51) projecting out of the magazine (42) a wafer return device
(52) is provided, activation of which is associated with a

sensor signal from a second sensor, the measurement beam of
which is directed parallel to the disc-shaped objects (44, 51)

and which during the height adjustment of the magazine (42) is
immediately adjacent to the side thereof which serves for

removal and supply.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in that a
handler with a multi-member articulated arm serves for

handling, of which the axes of rotation are hollow shafts (59,
61, 68) and the front member has a vacuum holding device (66)

to accommodate the disc-shaped object (44), and there is a
direct connection from the vacuum holding device to a vacuum

present in the hollow shafts (61, 68).
