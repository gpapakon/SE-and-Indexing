<ABSTRACT>
Described are fibre-reactive, sulpho-containing mono-, dis- and polyazo dyes, such as trisazo dyes, which contain a fibre-reactive grouping of the general formula 
<
IMAGE
>
 in which X is chlorine or fluorine and the group -SO2-Y is in each case a fibre-reactive group of the vinyl sulphone series and which additionally possesses elsewhere in the dye molecule one or more further fibre-reactive groups of the vinyl sulphone series. They are very highly suitable for dyeing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing material, especially fibre material, such as wool and synthetic polyamide fibres and especially cellulose fibre materials, such as cotton.
