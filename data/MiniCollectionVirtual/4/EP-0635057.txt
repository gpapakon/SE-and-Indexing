<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are methods for producing substantially pure EG III cellulase from Trichoderma spp. In particular the methods of the present invention comprise separation of the EG III cellulase component from an aqueous mixture of enzymes by the addition of polyethylene glycol to the aqueous mixture to create a two-phase system and separating the EG III-rich phase. The present invention is also directed in part to methods for preparing substantially pure EG III cellulase component by fractionation or by a combination of the above two methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to methods for
producing a polyethylene glycol solution containing
substantially pure EG III cellulase component, xylanase component or a mixture thereof. In
particular, the methods of the present invention are
directed to the separation of EG III cellulase and/or xylanase
component from an aqueous mixture of cellulase proteins
containing EG III and/or xylanase by the addition of a specified
polyethylene glycol to the aqueous mixture to create a
two-phase system containing an EG III-rich and/or xylanase-rich polyethylene
glycol phase and an EG III-poor and/or xylanase-poor aqueous phase and
separating the EG III-rich and/or xylanase-rich phase.
The present invention is also directed
to the enrichment of a xylanase polyethylene
glycol phase from an aqueous mixture of cellulase
proteins also containing xylanase.Cellulases are known in the art as enzymes that
hydrolyze cellulose (β-1,4-glucan linkages) thereby
resulting in the formation of glucose, cellobiose, 
cellooligosaccharides, and the like. While cellulases
are produced (expressed) in fungi, bacteria and the
like, cellulase produced by certain fungi and, in
particular by the fungus class Trichodermaspp.
(especially Trichodermareesei), have been given the
most attention because a complete cellulase system
capable of degrading crystalline forms of cellulose is
readily produced in large quantities via fermentation
procedures.In regard to the above, Schulein, "Methods in
Enzymology", 160, 25, pages 234 et seq. (1988),
disclose that complete fungal cellulase systems
comprise several different enzyme classifications
including those identified as exo-cellobiohydrolases
(EC 3.2.1.91) ("CBH"), endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4)
("EG"), and β-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.21) ("BG"). The
fungal cellulase classifications of CBH, EG and BG can
be further expanded to include multiple components
within each classification. For example, multiple CBHs
and EGs have been isolated from a variety of fungal
sources.The complete cellulase system comprising CBH, EG
and BG components is required to efficiently convert
crystalline cellulose to glucose. Isolated components
are far less effective, if at all, in hydrolyzing
crystalline cellulose. Moreover, a synergistic
relationship is observed between the cellulase
components particularly if they are of different
classification.On the other hand, cellulases and components
thereof, used either singularly or in combination, are
also known in the art to be useful in detergent
compositions. For example,

A method for isolating a composition enriched in EG III
cellulase, xylanase or a mixture thereof from an aqueous

mixture containing cellulase proteins which method comprises
adding 0.5 to 10% (w/v) of polyethylene glycol to

the aqueous mixture of cellulase proteins such that substantially
all of the cellulase proteins, other than EG

III, are retained in an EG III-poor or xylanase-poor
aqueous phase and the EG III cellulase or xylanase component

is retained in a EG III-rich or xylanase-rich
polyethylene glycol phase, further comprising separating

the polyethylene glycol, EG III-rich or xylanase-rich

ethanol is added to the polyethylene glycol EG III-rich

or xylanase-rich phase to precipitate the EG III or xylanase.

to the aqueous mixture before the addition of the polyethylene

glycol.
The method of claim 2 wherein the added inorganic salt
is selected from the group consisting of sodium sulfate,

magnesium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, sodium phosphate
and potassium phosphate.
The method of claim 1 wherein the beginning aqueous mixture
is a filtered whole-cell extract.
