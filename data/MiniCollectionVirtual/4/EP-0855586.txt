<ABSTRACT>
A wavelength dependence correction
method for optical variable attenuators, by

which attenuation can be set over a wide
wavelength range with a high precision and

adjustment is easy to adjust. Light signals (20a)
generated by a white light source (20) are made

to enter a monochrometer (21). Under the
control of a CPU (24), a light signal (20b) with

a specific wavelength only is extracted and
made to enter an optical variable attenuator

(22) which attenuates the light signal (20b)
under the control of the CPU (24). The power

of the attenuated light signal (20c) is measured
by a power meter (23) under the control of the

CPU (24) to generate correction data. The
position of the optical variable attenuator (22)

is adjusted to obtain a required attenuation by
utilizing data on the number of pulses

corresponding to the rotation angle of a motor
for driving the optical variable attenuator (22)

based on the correction data.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wavelength-dependent compensation method
in a variable optical attenuator, and in particular to a wavelength-dependent
compensation method in a variable optical attenuator which attenuates the wavelength
of an optical signal over a wide range of wavelengths in the optical signal, measures the
power of the optical signal with attenuated wavelengths, and supplies compensation
data which compensates wavelength-dependent loss.It is known that the amount of attenuation of a natural density filter (herebelow,
abbreviated "ND filter") generally used to suppress the amount of light in a variable
optical attenuator depends on wavelength characteristics. In order to achieve an
accurate setting of the amount of attenuation, it is necessary to limit attenuation to a
single wavelength, to actuate an ND filter with a motor drive member, to produce
rotation of the motor by the input of the pulse of its motor drive, and either to
compensate only the number of pulses corresponding to the angle of rotation of the
motor with respect to the amount of attenuation, or to compensate the entire range of
wavelengths to be set by using compensating data for the amount of attenuation.The method of compensating wavelength-dependency of an ND filter used in
conventional variable optical attenuators is explained in Fig. 9.Fig. 9 is a block diagram showing a structure of a variable optical attenuator
applying a conventional compensation method for wavelength-dependency. In Fig. 9,
an optical signal 6a that transits ND filter 1 is attenuated so as to equal the preset value
of the amount of attenuation set by ND filter 1 and is transformed into attenuated optical
signal 6b. The motor 2 is actuated by motor drive member 3 under control of a CPU 4.If the wavelength of optical signal 6a transiting ND filter 1 is uniform, the
amount of attenuation of the ND filter 1 is proportional to the angle of rotation, and the
angle of rotation of motor 2 is proportional to the pulse number input into the motor
drive member 3. However, as is clear from the wavelength-characteristics graph of an ND filter
1 shown in Fig 2, where the abscissa is the pulse number and the ordinate is the amount
of attenuation (dB), generally in the attenuation of an ND filter 1, the correction of the
amount of attenuation is conventionally limited to a single wavelength (e.g., 1310 nm)
because there is wavelength dependency.Therefore, an accurate amount of attenuation of an optical signal differing from
the wavelength used for correction
