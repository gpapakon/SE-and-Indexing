<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spring steel for 
a high strength spring which is used for a valve spring 
of an internal combustion engine, a suspension spring 
and the like, and particularly to a spring steel for a 
high strength spring capable of being drawn or peeled 
without annealing after hot rolling, which nevertheless 
sufficiently satisfies the strength (hardness) after 
quenching and tempering required as one of important 
spring characteristics and also exhibits the excellent 
corrosion resistance required for a suspension spring. 
The wording "spring steel" of the present invention 
includes not only a steel wire, wire rod or bar before 
being formed into a spring but also a spring as the 
final product. The chemical compositions of spring steels are 
specified in JIS G3565 to 3567, 4801 and the like. By 
use of these spring steels, various springs are 
manufactured by the steps of: hot-rolling each spring  
 
steel into a hot-rolled wire rod or bar (hereinafter, 
referred to as "rolled material"); and drawing the 
rolled material to a specified diameter and then cold 
forming the wire into a spring after oil-tempering, or 
drawing the rolled material or peeling and straightening 
the rolled material, heating and forming the wire into a 
spring, and quenching and tempering it. Recently, there 
have been strong demands toward the characteristics of 
springs, and to meet these demands, alloy steels 
subjected to heat treatment have been extensively used 
as the materials of the springs. In manufacture of a spring, a rolled material may 
be subjected to drawing directly after descaling. 
However, in the case where the rolled material has a 
high strength more than about 1350 MPa, it causes 
problems of breakage, seizure and bending during the 
drawing, or it causes a problem of the reduced tool life 
in the peeling; accordingly, it requires a softening 
heat treatment such as annealing. The softening heat 
treatment such as annealing, however, causes an 
inconvenience in increasing the manufacturing cost due 
to an increase in the processing step. On the other hand, there is a tendency in the field 
of automobile toward the enhancement of the stress of a  
 
spring as a part of measures of achieving 
lightweightness for reducing exhaust gas and fuel 
consumption. Namely, in the field of automobile, there 
is required a spring steel for a high strength spring 
which has a strength after quenching and tempering of 
1900 MPa or more. However, as the strength of a spring 
is enhanced, the
