<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus are provided for inserting 
and removing a communication wire in and out of a pipeline by 

air flow, in which static electricity can be prevented from 
being generated, and a long communication wire can be inserted 

and removed. The communication wire is fed from a reel, and 
inserted into a pipeline through a blowing head. Compressed 

air is also sent from a compressor to the pipeline through the 
blowing head. A drop cylinder is attached to a T-branch on the 

way of the pipeline, conductive material stored therein is 
supplied into the pipeline at a controlled rate. A recovery 

bottle is attached to the outlet side of the pipeline so that 

the air flow blowing out of the outlet side is passed through 
a filter 11, and at the same time the conductive material is 

recovered. By making the conductive material pass through the 
pipeline together with the air flow, generated static 

electricity can be eliminated, and the communication wire can 
be prevented from contacting tightly with the pipeline because 

of the static electricity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for inserting a communication wire through a pipeline, in which 
the communication wire, such as an optical fiber cable or the 
like, coated with an insulating material is inserted through 
the pipeline by air flow, and particularly relates to the 
method in which the resistance of propelling the communication 
wire is reduced. In a method of inserting a communication wire material 
through a laid pipeline by air flow while blowing compressed 
air therein, it is important to reduce the friction coefficient 
between the communication wire and the inner wall of a 
pipeline. For example, in an optical fiber cable disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. Hei-2-50111, the 
friction coefficient is reduced by adding a solid lubricant to 
an outermost layer of a coating layer which is a contacting 
surface with the inner wall of a pipeline. In addition, a 
method of laying an optical fiber cable in which blowing powder 
talc as lubricant is disclosed in EP-A-108 590 (Japanese Patent Examined 
Publication No. Hei-2-22921) according to the precharacterizing parts of claims 1, 2 and 8.  
 In general, a pipeline through which a communication 
wire is inserted is made of insulating resin. The coating 
layer of the communication wire is made of an insulating resin. 
With respect to an optical fiber cable, for example, the cable 
is usually coated with foamed polyethylene and it is pressed 
and inserted into a polyethylene pipeline. As for the gas for 
propelling the cable, dried air or nitrogen is usually used in 
order to avoid increasing the frictional resistance due to 
moisture. There is therefore a tendency to cause static 
electricity by friction when a communication wire is pressed 
and inserted into a pipeline by air flow. If static 
electricity is generated, resistance is produced by the 
electrostatic force so that frictional resistance increases. 
In the above-mentioned methods, there is indeed an effort to 
reduce the friction coefficient, but there is no effort to 
reduce static electricity. Although a method of coating the 
surface of a coating layer of a communication wire with an 
antistatic material such as diethanolamine or the like has been 
reported, experiments made by the present inventor and others 
have proven that the antistatic material is shaved from the 
communication wire by friction against the pipeline. The 
antistatic effect is reduced if the insertion distance is 
increased, that is, the greater the insertion
