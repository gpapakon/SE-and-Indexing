<ABSTRACT>
A chop saw (10) comprises a table (12), a pivot member (14) on the 
table, a saw assembly (16) pivoted about axis (18) to the pivot 

member, a blade (26) journalled in said assembly, a motor (22) to 
drive the blade, an upper guard (32) to cover an upper portion of 

said blade, which upper guard is pivoted to said assembly, and a 
lower guard (40) to cover a lower portion of said blade, which lower 

guard is also pivoted to said assembly, both about the blade axis 
(28). 
A parallelogram lever (34) has a pivoted connection to the pivot 
member (38) and upper guard (36) to maintain the orientation of the 

upper guard in all pivot positions of the assembly. An extension (35) 
of the parallelogram lever co-operates a flange (100) on the lower 

guard such that, in a raised rest position of the saw assembly and in 
an unopened position of the lower guard, the extension engages the 

flange and prevents downward pivoting of the assembly. 
An actuator (94) opens the lower guard to an extent sufficient to 
rotate the flange out of abutment with the extension, whereupon 

subsequent downward pivoting of the saw assembly serves to 
engage the extension with a cam surface of the flange to open further 

the lower guard.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to circular saws of the type comprising a 
table, a pivot member on the table and a saw assembly pivoted about 
a pivot axis with respect to said pivot member, whereby said saw 
assembly carrying a motor driven blade can be plunged into a 
workpiece supported on the table. Such saws are known and described in published patent 
documents such as EP 0133666 and EP 0450400. These saws are 
useful and have numerous possibilities for enhancement to improve 
the capacity, capability and efficiency, not to mention cleanliness 
and safety of their arrangements. On the other hand, all these 
features add complexity and cost, and may render the saw user 
unfriendly. Both EP 0133666 and EP 0450400 mentioned above describe 
saws in which the saw assembly comprises an upper guard and a 
lower guard for the blade. The upper guard is formed from or on the 
housing of the assembly and permanently covers a top part of the 
blade. A bottom part of the blade is covered by the lower guard, but 
thus must be withdrawn in use so that the blade is exposed when 
required to perform cutting operations. A handle is disposed on the upper guard or housing by means of 
which a user can pivot the saw assembly up and down to perform 
cutting operations on a workpiece supported on the table. The lower guard may be opened entirely by an actuating lever 
disposed on said handle. Alternatively the guard may be opened  
 
automatically by pivoting of the saw assembly, there being provided 
a connection between the guard and the pivot member for this 
purpose. A further alternative is that the guard may be opened partly 
by either of these arrangements and only further opened by direct 
contact with a workpiece. None of these is ideal or covers every 
desirable eventuality. In particular it is desirable only to open the 
guard as much as is necessary to cut the workpiece and no more, 
otherwise the dangerous blade is needlessly exposed. In any event, 
it is desirable (and, indeed, essential in some jurisdictions) to provide 
the following two safety features: first, a lock on the lower guard so 
that it cannot be manipulated open except by proper operation of the 
saw; and second, a lock on the saw assembly so that it cannot pivot 
down from a rest position except by proper operation, involving a 
release of the lock. It is an object of the present invention to provide a saw of the 
type described above which provides a good compromise between 
the often conflicting requirements of ease of use versus safety of use.

<CLAIMS>
A saw comprising a table, a pivot member on the table, a saw 
assembly pivoted with respect to the pivot member, a blade 

journalled in said assembly, a motor to drive the blade, an upper 
guard to cover an upper portion of said blade, which upper guard is 

pivoted to said assembly, a lower guard to cover a lower portion of 
said blade, which lower guard is pivoted to said assembly, a 

parallelogram lever having a pivoted connection to the pivot member 
and upper guard to maintain the orientation of said upper guard with 

respect to pivot member in all pivot positions of the assembly with 
respect to said pivot member, and an extension of said parallelogram 

lever co-operating with said lower guard such that, in a raised rest 
position of the saw assembly with respect to said pivot member and 

in an unopened position of said lower guard with respect to said 
blade, said extension engages said lower guard and prevents pivoting 

of the assembly with respect to said pivot member, means being 
provided to open said lower guard to an extent sufficient to remove 

abutment thereof with said extension, whereupon subsequent 
pivoting of said saw assembly from said raised position serves to 

engage said extension with said lower guard to open further said 
lower guard. 
A saw as claimed in claim 1, in which said lower guard 
comprises a flange engaged by said extension and said guard 

opening means rotates said flange out of abutment with said 
extension and said flange has a cam surface engaged by said  

 
extension on said subsequent pivoting of the saw assembly to further 

rotate and open said lower guard. 
A saw as claimed in claim 2, in which said extension and flange 
co-operate sufficiently to open the guard only as much as necessary 

with typically found workpieces to avoid contact of the lower guard 
with such workpieces, the guard being capable of further opening on 

contact thereof with non-typical workpieces. 
A saw as claimed in claim 2 or 3, in which said means to open 
said lower guard comprises an actuator lever connected with said 

lower guard to open said lower guard a first amount sufficient to 
withdraw said flange from abutment with said extension. 
A saw as claimed in claim 4, in which said actuator lever has 
means engaging said lower guard such that said guard cannot be 

opened without first activating said lever. 
A saw as claimed in claim 5, in which the actuator lever is 
connected to said lower guard by a cable which has a small amount 

of dead-slack in it so that the guard is not opened until the lever 
disengages the guard. 
A saw as claimed in claim 6, in which the cable passes through 
an eye in said lever and is captivated on said guard so that the guard 

pushes the cable through said eye when the guard is further opened 

by said extension on said flange or by opening contact with a 
workpiece. 
A saw as claimed in any preceding claim, in which said 
assembly comprises a housing mounting said motor and an axle 

disposed in a wall of said housing, a hollow spindle journalled for  
 

rotation about said axle on one side of said housing and carrying said 
blade. 
A saw as claimed in claim 8, in which said lower guard is 
mounted on said axle on the other side of said housing. 
A saw as claimed in claim 9, in which said housing has a 
cylindrical section around said spindle and said lower guard has a 

cup-shaped part supported on said cylindrical section. 
A saw as claimed in claim 9 or 10, in which said upper guard is 
mounted on said axle beyond said lower guard with respect to said 

wall of the housing. 
A saw as claimed in any of claims 8 to 11, in which said motor 
drives said spindle through a belt surrounding said spindle.
