<ABSTRACT>
An image of one screen is recorded by repeating a 
recording operation which includes a main scanning 

operation performed by moving a recording head in which a 
plurality of recording elements are arrayed in a direction 

(a horizontal scanning direction) perpendicular to that in 
which said plurality of recording elements are arrayed and 

a vertical scanning operation performed by moving a 
recording medium in a direction perpendicular to the 

horizontal scanning direction through a distance 
corresponding to a recording width after the horizontal 

scanning operation is completed. When image data having a 
width narrower than the maximum recording width of the 

recording head is recorded, e.g., when a reduction 
recording is performed, plurality of image data each having 

the narrower width are combined so that image data having 
the maximum recording width can be recorded in one 

recording operation using the plurality of recording 
elements. When a reduction ratio is, for example, 50%, the 

image data for the first line is stored in a memory. When 
image data for the second line is input, the data for the 

first line is read from the memory and combined with the 
data for the second line, and the combined data is output 

to the recording head. Consequently, when image data  
 

having a width narrower than the maximum recording width of 
the recording head is recorded for, for example, reduction 

image recording, the image quality and the recording speed 
can be improved at a low cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of recording
images on a recording material using a recording head
having a plurality of recording elements as well as an
apparatus therefor.Conventional ink jet or thermal printers are designed
such that they record images first by performing main
(horizontal) scanning by moving a recording head in which a
plurality of recording elements are arrayed in a direction
(a horizontal scanning direction) different from that in
which the recording elements are arrayed and then by
conveying a recording medium in a direction substantially
perpendicular to the horizontal scanning direction through
a distance corresponding to a recording width after the
horizontal scanning is completed.Fig. 18 illustrates how such a printer performs
printing. Reference numeral 101 denotes a recording
medium. Reference numeral 102 denotes a recording head in
which a plurality of recording elements are arrayed. The 
recording head 102 is capable of recording an image
consisting of 128 pixels on the recording medium 101 in one
recording operation.To form an image of one screen using the above-described
type of recording head, recording of a width of
128 pxiels is first performed at a pretermined density
(period) by moving the recording head 102 in a direction
indicated by an arrow 103 at a predetermined speed (main
(horizontal) scanning) to form a band image having a width
of 128 pixels.After the recording medium 101 is moved through a
distance corresponding to the width of 128 pixels in a
direction indicated by an arrow 104 (sub (vertical)
scanning), recording is performed again by moving the
recording head 102 in a direction indicated by the arrow
103, whereby an image having a width of a total of 2 bands,
i.e., 2 x 128 pixels, is formed.An image of one screen is formed by repeating a
sequence of those operations a predetermined times.The above-described printer may be connected to a
reader so that it can record data representing an image of
an original read by a scanner. In such a case, a reading
head constructed such that the reading operation thereof is
associated with the operation of the above-described
recording head may be used, and one screen of the image of 
the original may be read in the same scanning method as the
scanning method of the recording head.More specifically, such a reading head has a sensor
capable of reading 128 pixels in one reading operation, and
the reading direction of the reading head corresponds to
the recording direction of the recording head.
Accordingly,
