<ABSTRACT>
A turntable (10) with a stepped drive, in which a table top (12) is rotatably fitted on antifriction bearings on the top of a housing (14). From the underside of the table top (12) project evenly drive pins (36) in staggered array at equal angular distances apart over the same diameter which engage in a control groove (34) in a motor-driven drive roller (32) fitted in a housing, the cycle of which determines the characteristic of the rotary movement of the table top (12). The diameter of the circular table top (12) is greater than the upper region of the housing (14) forming the bearing region (40). The region of the table top (12) projecting radially beyond the housing is thickened towards the bottom in such a way that it surrounds the bearing region (10) of the housing to some extent. The housing-side races of the antifriction bearing for the table top are formed in the radially outward-facing wall of the housing (14) in the bearing region (40). A bearing ring (50) is releasably secured to the downward-facing surface of the edge region of the table top downwardly surrounding the housing (14) in the bearing region and the race for the bearing elements (bearing balls 44) on the table top side, which lies partly in the surrounding outer table top edge region and partly in the bearing ring (50) are formed in the inner surface of the table top (10) opposite the races in the housing.

Rotary table (10) with a stepping drive including a table plate (12),
which is rotatably mounted by means of roller bearings on the upper surface of

a housing (14) and projecting from whose underside there is a plurality of drive
pegs (36), which are offset at uniform angular spacings and arranged on the

same diameter and which engage in a control groove (34) in a motor driven
drive roller (32) mounted in the housing (14), the shape of the control groove

(34) determining the characteristics of the rotary movement of the table plate
(12), characterised in that the circular shaped table plate (12) has a diameter

which is larger than the associated upper region, which is also of circular shape
and affords the bearing region (40), the housing (14), that the region (48) of the

table plate (12) which extends radially beyond the housing is of increased
thickness in the downward direction so that it somewhat engages around the

bearing region (40) of the housing (14) in the downward direction, that the races
on the housing side of the roller bearing (46) for the table plate (12) are formed

in the radially outwardly directed wall of the housing (14) in the bearing region
(40), that releasably secured to the downwardly directed surface of the edge

region (48) of the table plate, which engages downwardly around the housing
(14) in the bearing region, there is a bearing ring (50) and that formed in the

inner surface of the table plate (10) opposite to the races in the housing (14)
there are the races for the support of the rollers on the bearing plate side which

are situated partly in the overhanging outer edge region (48) of the table plate
and partly in the bearing ring (50).
Rotary table as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the races on the 
housing side of the roller bearing (46) are constituted by two vertically space
d
wire rings (47) of hardened steel wire, which are disposed in a groove (42) in

the upper bearing region (40) of the housing (14) and that the races on the table
plate side of the roller bearing (46) are constituted by two vertically spaced wire

rings (56) of hardened steel wire which are arranged in a groove (54) formed
partly in the inner surface of the annular overhanging edge region (48) of the

table plate (12) directed towards the housing and partly in the bearing ring (50).
