<ABSTRACT>
A transimpedance amplifier circuit for converting an input 
current to an output voltage includes a feedback resistor 

variable circuit (3) which is connected in parallel to a 
feedback resistor (Rf) and a load resistor variable circuit 

(4) which is connected to a collector of an amplifying 
transistor (Q1). The feedback resistor variable circuit 

includes a first resistor (R5) and a first P-N junction 
diode (D1) connected in series. After the first P-N junction 

diode (D1) turns on in accordance with the increase in 
the input current, the transimpedance is decreased. As a 

result, a wide input dynamic range can be achieved. The 
load resistor variable circuit (4) includes a reference 

voltage source (4) and a series circuit of a second P-N 
junction diode (D2) and a second resistor (R6). After the 

second P-N junction diode (D2) turns on in accordance with 
the increase in the input current, an effective load resistance 

value of the amplifying transistor is decreased, 
whereby the gain of the amplification transistor is decreased. 

The transimpedance amplifier circuit has an 
increased input dynamic range, a sufficient phase margin 

while low noise characteristics are maintained. Further, 
because the tran
simpedance amplifier circuit adopts a P-N 
junction diode, it is less susceptible to the influence of 

variations in characteristics of the elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a transimpedance amplifier
circuit for use as a front end amplifier of a burst-signal
adaptable optical receiver, which requires a wide dynamic
range, of an optical transmission system in a subscriber's
Passive Optical Network (PON) system and so on.In order to increase a dynamic range in an optical
receiver, it has been known to vary a feedback resistance
value of a transimpedance amplifier circuit, used as a
front end amplifier of a receiving circuit, in accordance
with the magnitude of an input signal level. Such technique
is disclosed in, for example JP-A-59(1984)-50632.One exemplary configuration of a conventional transimpedance
amplifier circuit of a variable feedback resistance
type will now be described. Fig. 1 shows a variable feedback
resistance type transimpedance amplifier circuit as
disclosed on page 177 of the Fourth Separated Volume of
Collected Lecture Theses from the Spring National Convention 
by the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication
Engineers (IEICE) of Japan in 1992. In this
variable feedback resistance type transimpedance amplifier
circuit, a light receiving element such as a photo-diode PD
is connected between a base of a first transistor Q10 and
the ground. A collector of the first transistor Q10 is
connected to a base of a second transistor Q20. A diode
D9, a resistor R9 and a constant-current source Iee are
connected in series between an emitter of the transistor
Q20 and the power source Vee. Also, a feedback resistor Rf
is coupled between the base of the transistor Q10 and the
connection node between the resistor R9 and the constant-current
source Iee. A diode D1 for varying a feedback
resistance value is connected in parallel to the feedback
resistor Rf and the resistor R9, thereby constituting a
variable feedback resistor circuit. One input terminal of
an output buffer 10 is connected to the emitter of the
transistor Q20, whilst the other input terminal thereof is
connected to a reference voltage generating circuit 20. An
output terminal of this output buffer 10 is connected to an
output terminal OUT of the transimpedance amplifier circuit.
A current flowing through the light receiving diode
PD increases in proportion to an increase in the intensity
or level of an optical input signal, and hence a current to
be inputted to the transimpedance amplifier circuit is increased. 
When the diode D1 turns on according to the increase
of the input current to the transimpedance amplifier
circuit, the transimpedance is decreased. As a
