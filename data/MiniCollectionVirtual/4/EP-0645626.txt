<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a measuring device (20), in particular for measuring the level of glucose in the blood, intended to be associated with a removable sensor (4) comprising at least one active zone (6). In particular, the invention relates to the electrical connection between the measuring device (20) and the removable sensor (4). Each electrical contact area (8, 10) of the removable sensor is associated with two electrical contact members (24, 26; 25, 27) in order to make it possible to check, before taking a measurement, the state of the electrical contacts between these electrical contact members and the corresponding contact areas.

Measuring device (20) intended to be used with a
removable sensor (4), having at least two electrical

contact surfaces (8,10), and comprising measuring means
(30;40) and connecting means (22) comprising at least two

first contact means (24,27) electrically connected to a
voltage source, these two first contact means (24,27)

being used respectively to establish an electrical
connection between said two contact surfaces of said

removable sensor and these measuring means, this measuring
device being characterized in that said connecting means

(22) also comprises at least two second contact means
(25,26), these two second contact means being used

respectively to connect electrically said two contact
surfaces of said removable sensor to testing means (32,34;

42,44,46) enabling said electrical connection between each
of said first contact surfaces and said measuring means to

be tested.
Measuring device according to claim 1, said
measuring means (30;40) enabl
ing an electric current (IC)
capable of flowing between these two first contact means

to be measured, this measuring device being characterized
in that said testing means (32,34) comprises an electrical

testing resistor (34) electrically connected in series
with said two second contact means (25,26) and comparing

means enabling the value of said electric current (IC) to
be compared to a first reference value, said testing means

being arranged to indicate that said measuring device used
with said removable sensor is not functioning when said

value of said electric current is less than said first
reference value.
Measuring device according to claim 2, said
removable sensor (4) comprising at least one active zone

(6;6a,6b,6c) intended to be placed in contact with a
substance to be analysed and electrically connected in

series with the two contact surfaces (8, 10), this active 
zone having a high resistance to the flow of an electric

current between the two contact surfaces when this active
zone is not in contact with any substance which is

electrically conductive in conjunction with said active
zone, this measuring device being characterized in that

said comparing means enables the value of said electric
current (IC) to be compared to a second reference value,

said testing means being arranged to indicate that said
measuring device used with said removable sensor is not

functioning when said value of said electric current is
greater than said second reference value.
Measuring device according to claim 1, characterized
in that said testing means (42,44,46) comprises a

first switch (44) capable of switching between a first
terminal (48) and a second terminal (50) and a second

switch (46) capable of switching between a third terminal
(51) and a fourth terminal (49), said first and third

terminals (48,51) being connected respectively to said two
first contact means (24,27), said second and fourth

terminals (50,49) being connected respectively to said two
second contact means (25,26), said measuring means

comprising a voltage supply intended to be electrically
connected in series to said first and second switches

(44,46) and enabling an electric current capable of
flowing between these first and second switches to be

measured, said testing means enabling said first and
second switches to be activated independently and

comprising comparing means enabling the value of said
electric current to be compared to a first reference

value, this testing means being arranged to indicate that
said measuring device used with said removable sensor is

not functioning when said value of said electric current
is less than said first reference value.
Measuring device according to claim 4, said
removable sensor comprising at least one active zone

(6;6a,6b,6c) intended to be placed in contact with a
substance to be analysed and electrically connected in 

series to said two contact surfaces (8,10), said active
zone having a high resistance to the flow of an electric

current between the two contact surfaces when this active
zone is not in contact with any substance which is

electrically conductive in conjunction with this active
zone, this measuring device being characterized in that

said comparing means enables the value of said electric
current to be compared to a second reference value, said

testing means being arranged to indicate that said
measuring device used with said removable sensor is not

functioning when said value of said electric current is
greater than said second reference value.
Measuring device according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that this measuring

device and said removable sensor with which it is used are
arranged to measure glucose levels in blood.
