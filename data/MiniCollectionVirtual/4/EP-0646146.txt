<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming extended chain polyesters and block or graft polyesters or copolymers which comprises the steps of (a) forming an intimate mixture of one or more polyesters, and an effective amount of one or more effective chain extension reagent compounds and (b) heating said mixture for a time and at a temperature sufficient to form said extended chain, or graft or block copolyester or polyester; wherein the polyester used in step (a) contains no or substantially no substances which comprise elements from groups VA and VIA of the periodic table in elemental form or any other form, for example, inorganic or organic compounds, complexes or salts.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the process for coupling 
polyester materials, thereby forming 
extended chain polyesters, and graft or block 
polyesters and copolyesters. Coupling as described 
above is referred to herein as a chain extension 
process. Chain extension or coupling as discussed 
herein includes the coupling of polyesters end-to-end, 
coupling one terminal group to a non-terminal group or 
coupling through polymers having only non-terminal 
reactive groups. Improved extended chain polyesters, 
and block or graft copolyesters of this invention lack 
discoloration attributes of many materials of the prior 
art. 
Extended chain polyesters, and block or 
graft polymers and copolymers prepared in accordance 
with the process of this invention are capable of being 
fabricated into useful shaped articles of manufacture, 
e.g. filaments, both mono- and multifilament, films, 
tapes, ribbons, rods, laminates and the like. U.S. Patent 4,568,720 discloses a 
process for preparing extended chain polyesters, and 
block or graft polyester or copolyesters by forming an 
intimate mixture of one or more polyesters and an 
effective amount of one or more chain extension reagent 
compounds, and thereafter heating the intimate mixture 
at a temperature and for a time sufficient to form the  
 
desired amount of the desired polyester or copolyester. One embodiment of the invention provides a process for forming extended 
chain polyesters and block or graft polyesters or copolyesters which comprises 
the steps of: 
(a) (i) forming an intimate mixture of one or more polyesters, and an 
effective amount of one or more phosphorus (III)-containing compounds; or (a)(ii) forming an intimate mixture of (1) one or more polyesters, (2) at 
least one polymer having a plurality, i.e. more than two, of reactive groups 
through which the polyester of (a) is grafted under process condition, and (3) 
an effective amount of one or more phosphorus (III)-containing chain extension 
reagent compounds; and (b) heating said mixture for a time and at a temperature sufficient to 
form said extended chain, or block or graft polyester or copolyester, wherein 
the polyester used in step (a) contains no or substantially no substances which 
comprise elements from groups VA and VIA of the periodic table in elemental 
form or any other form. Preferably the polyester used in step (a) is prepared in the absence of or 
substantial absence of antimony, arsenic, bismuth, tellurium or selenium. The process of this invention is advantageous since the
