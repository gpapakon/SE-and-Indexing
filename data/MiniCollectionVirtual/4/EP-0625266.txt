<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus which uses ultrasonic techniques to inspect critical pipe joints and other critical industrial areas that are normally inaccessible. A waveguide (20, 46) including one or more flexible fibers (72) is embedded in concrete (12) or whatever else embeds the piping which includes the critical area. One end of the waveguide (20, 46) is accessible so that an ultrasonic transducer (30) can be used to transmit ultrasonic signals along the waveguide (20, 46) and receive reflected echoes to provide an ultrasonic image of the critical area. In a case where the area to be inspected is submerged, the waveguide (20, 46) takes the form of a flexible fiber bundle which is manipulated until its end is adjacent to the critical area. Some of the fibers (72) in the bundle can be used to illuminate the critical area, and other fibers (72) can transmit optical images for display on a video monitor (78).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to ultrasonic imaging
and deals more particularly with the use of ultrasonic
techniques for the inspection of areas to which access is
restricted.In a variety of industrial processes, there are areas
that are inaccessible and yet at the same time critical
to the process. For example, pipes which conduct the
flow of process fluids are often embedded in concrete or
a similar material such that inspection of critical pipe
joints is impossible. If a faulty weld exists or if a
critical area should otherwise fail while the pipes are
in service, the lack of ability to carry out inspections
creates a situation where no warning is given of a possibly
dangerous condition. As an example, in a nuclear
power plant or other critical facility, if piping which
conducts cooling fluid should leak, disastrous consequences
can follow. If the piping is capable of being
inspected on a regular basis, the problem can be detected
early enough to allow corrective action to be taken
before there is a complete failure. Similar situations arise as to pipes and fittings that
are submerged in storage tanks for petroleum based liquids
and other types of liquids. Access to submerged
areas is restricted if not precluded altogether, so leaks
and other problems can arise without any warning because
inspections of the submerged areas are not practical and
perhaps not even possible. The same problems are presented
as to inspections in hostile environments such as
areas exposed to the high levels of radiation or toxic
chemicals.US-A-3 264 863 discloses a method and apparatus for detecting imminent boiling and cavitation utilizing ultrasonic techniques.The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus
for carrying out ultrasonic inspections and examinations
of locations that are normally inaccessible and
thus not subject to inspection. By way of example,
through the techniques employed by the present invention,
a critical pipe weld which is embedded in a concrete slab
can be inspected while the piping remains in service.
Accordingly, signs of problems in the weld can be detected
before they become so great that the weld fails. In
addition, submerged components and structures located in
hostile environments can be inspected to detect problems
before they have developed to the point of complete
failure.In accordance with the invention, a waveguide for transmitting
ultrasonic signals takes the form of at least one
and usually a number of quartz fibers arranged in a
bundle. In the case of a pipe weld or
