<ABSTRACT>
A sequential drawer slide comprising a supporting rail (12) to be fastened to a furniture carcass, a pull-out rail (3) to be fastened to the drawer and a centre rail (8) arranged therebetween, on each side of the drawer. The weight of the drawers is transmitted between the rails (3, 8, 12) by means of running rollers. There is provided a control belt (15) embodied as an endless belt, which is fastened to the supporting rail (12) and to the pull-out rail (3) and which, at the front and rear end of the centre rail (8), lies against the latter and is guided around the latter. Preferably, at the front and rear end of the centre rail (8) there is in each case arranged a rope deflection roller (7, 9) over which the control belt (15) is guided. A coupling having two separable coupling parts (4, 11) is provided, said coupling detachably connecting the control belt (15) to the pull-out rail (3).

Differential slide for drawers or the like, having a 
supporting rail (12) which is to be secured to the carcass of a 

piece of furniture, an extension rail (3) which is to be secured 
to the drawer, and a centre rail (8) arranged therebetween, on 

each side of the drawer, the weight of the drawers being 
transferred between the rails (3, 8, 12) by means of running 

rollers or the like, having a control belt (15) which is designed 
as an endless belt, is secured to the supporting rail (12) and 

to the extension rail (3) and at the front and rear end of the 
centre rail (8) bears against the latter and is guided around the 

latter, a respective deflection roller (7, 9) via which the 
control belt (15) is guided being arranged at the front end and 

at the rear end of the centre rail, characterised in that a 
coupling is provided which has an inner and an outer coupling 

part (4, 11) and detachably connects the control belt (15) to the 

extension rail (3), the inner coupling part (11) being 
constructed as an elongate part with at least one profiled 

surface (31) of sawtooth-like construction and a corresponding 
profiled surface (30) of the outer coupling part (4) being able 

to be brought into engagement with this profiled surface (31). 
Differential slide according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the outer coupling part (4) is of pincer-like design with 

two holding jaws (29). 
Differential slide according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the two holding jaws (29) have, on the inside, sawtooth-like 

profiled surfaces (30) which bear laterally against the two 
profiled surfaces (31), constructed with corresponding toothing, 

of the inner coupling part (11). 
Differential slide according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the inner coupling part (11) is of bar-shaped construction 

and has the control belt (15) passing through it in the 
longitudinal direction.
