<ABSTRACT>
Laser Doppler device for measuring the diameter and the velocity of a particle (1) moving in a flow within a measurement volume, the diameter of which particle is larger than approximately 1/5 of the extent of the measurement volume, the measurement volume being defined as the region in which at least two laser beams (2, 3), generated by a device and having a defined phase relationship with respect to one another, intersect having at least two detector units (4, 5), aligned with the measurement volume, for picking up and detecting laser beams scattered on the particle (1) to be measured and for emitting signals, the amplitudes of which depend on the intensity of the scattered radiation picked up, and having a signal processing device for determining the size of the particle (1) from the signals from the detector units (4, 5), the laser beams (2, 3) and the two detector units (4, 5) being arranged with a component of the flow vector such that the flow component, the propagation vectors for the laser beams (2, 3) and the detector direction vectors (6, 7) for the detector units (4, 5) lie in a common plane and such that the detector units (4, 5) are arranged with their detector direction vectors (6, 7) in the plane such that they both pick up scattered (stray) light from the same particle (1).

Laser Doppler device for measuring the diameter and
velocity of a particle (1) which is moving in a flow within a

test volume and of which the diameter is greater than about
1/5 of the dimension of the test volume, the test volume being

defined as the region in which at least two laser beams (2, 3)
which are produced by a device and are in a specific phase

relationship to one another intersect, with at least two
detector units (4, 5) orientated toward the test volume for

sensing and detecting the laser beams scattered on the
particle (1) to be measured and for transmitting signals of

which the amplitudes depend on the intensity of the sensed
scattered radiation and with a signal processing system for

determining the size of the particle (1) from the signals from
the detector units (4, 5), characterized in that the laser

beams (2, 3) and the two detector units (4, 5) are so arranged
with a c
omponent of the flow vector that the flow component,
the propagation vectors for the laser beams (2, 3) and the

detector direction vectors (6, 7) for the detector units (4,
5) lie in a common plane and that the detector units (4, 5)

with their detector direction vectors (6, 7) are arranged in
the plane in such a way that they both sense scattered light

from the same particle (1).
Laser Doppler device according to claim 1, characterized
in that the device for producing the laser beams (2, 3)

comprises an optical system by means of which the angle a at
which the laser beams (2, 3) each impinge upon one another at

the z-axis in the test volume can be varied and whereby the
test volume defined by the two laser beams (2, 3) can be

adjusted. 
Method of operating a laser Doppler device according to
claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the oscillations of the

signals of the detector units (4, 5) occurring in the test
volume owing to the movement of the particle (1) are recorded,

in that the phase difference between the oscillations of the
two signals of the detector units (4, 5) is defined and in

that the phase difference is converted into a measured value
defining the size of the particles.
Method according to claim 3, characterized in that a
determined phase difference is rejected if it is produced

during the egress or entry of the particle (1) into the test
volume and the detector units (3, 4) are so orientated that

the signals resulting either from the rear or front surface of
the particle (1) with respect to the direction of flow can be

distinguished.
Method according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that
the phase difference is rejected if the amplitude of the

oscillation of the signal from a detector unit (4 or 5) is
smaller than the product of a predetermined ratio value with

the maximum amplitude of the oscillation produced during a
movement of the particle (1) in the detector unit (4 or 5).
Method according to claim 5, characterized in that the
predetermined ratio value is 0.5.
Method according to one of claims 3 to 6, characterized
in that an approximate particle size is defined from the

signal height of at least one of the detector units (4 or 5)
and this value is used to eliminate ambiguities in the phase

difference with respect to 2π. 
Method according to one of claims 3 to 7, characterized
in that more than two detector units are arranged and the

phase differences between each two of these detector units are
defined and compared for conformity with respect to identical

particle size in order to eliminate uncertainties in the phase
differences with respect to 2π.
Method according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in that
the phase differences at which the uncertainties with respect

to 2π are eliminated are averaged to define an average
measured particle size.
Method according to one of claims 3 to 9, characterized
in that the phase differences defined during a passage of the

particle (1) through the test volume or the measured values
allocated to them for the size of the particle (1) are

compared with one another and any measured values picked up
during passage are rejected in the case of deviations lying

outside the measuring accuracy.
Method according to one of claims 3 to 10, characterized
in that the signals from the detector units (4, 5) are

compared, during passage of the particle (1) through the test
volume, with theoretical signal trends predetermined for

different particle eizes and velocities and in that the
measured values are rejected if the signal trends differ

greatly from the theoretical signal trends.
Method according to one of claims 3 to 11, characterized
in that a measured value distribution is determined from the

measured particle sizes and in that the measured value
distribution is corrected with respect to acceptance provided

by the test volume and losses owing to rejected measurements. 
Laser Doppler device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that it contains a computer for carrying out

at least one of the methods according to claims 3 to 12.
