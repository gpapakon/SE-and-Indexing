<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for obtaining an at least prevailing
or even exclusive expansion in the anterior sector

of the maxillary arch comprises two substantially
symmetrical components (1, 3) with arms (11, 12;

31, 32) fan-like stretching apart and to be
combined with orthodontic bands (40); said two

components (1, 3) are articulated to one another by
means of a hinge (5); an expansion screw (7) acting

between said two components (1, 3) is able to
stretch them angularly apart by progressive actions

to be exerted on the same screw.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an apparatus, that
is, an orthodontic screw, for obtaining an
expansion of the upper maxillary arch, said screw
being able to cause a prevailing or exclusive
expansion, especially of fast type, of the anterior
arch alone. Palates have often been found to
exhibit very small transverse diameters in the
anterior sector arch and almost normal diameters in
the molar arch. In these cases, it is not possible
to apply a traditional fast expansion screw which
stretches apart with a parallel movement, as it
would imply an increase of both the anterior and
posterior, that is molar, diameters.The invention refers to an apparatus allowing only
the expansion in the anterior sector, which has
proven to be very useful in such cases as LPS
(PALATE-LABIAL SCHISTASIS), alteration of
transverse diameters during children's growth and,
in adults, after corticotomy.The publication ZAHNARZTLICHE RUNDSCHAU No. 119 of
8 March 1964, HEIDELBERG DE. page 78 XP002031839
"Wipla Schwenk-Dehnschraube" discloses a fan-like
opening screw, with two arms from which appendixes
emerge for connection with the resin of two
corresponding plates intended to exert a pressure
on the inner side of teeth belonging to the arch
under treatment. This known apparatus is intended
to displace the teeth within their relevant sockets
for correction purposes, however, the structure of
the same apparatus does not allows a spreading
action for the detachment of the palate suture.
Such an effect is actually obtainable only with
apparatus fixedly applied to the teeth and able to
exert a fast spreading action through mobile
protheses of the type described above. Accordingly,
said known screw proves to be unsuited for the
correction of palate malformations characterized by
reduced transverse diameters in the front sector
and normal or approximately normal ones in the
molar sector.Also known from patent FR 981973 is a mouth
corrector comprising two orthodontic plates
connected betwwen them by elastic means to exert a
push onto the internal side of the teeth of the
arch under corrective treatment. But also this
known apparatus is intended to displace teeth in
their respective sockets without interesting the
relevant bony structures.Document WO 94/26196 discloses a palate expander
with linear action to achieve a uniform palatal
expansion only in a direction orthogonal to the
sagittal plane.The present orthodontic apparatus comprises two
substantially symmetrical components, with arms,
mostly fan-like stretching apart, to be combined

<CLAIMS>
Orthodontic apparatus, especially of fast expansion type, for the upper
maxillary arch, able to achieve at least a prevailing or even exclusive

expansion in the anterior sector, comprising two substantially symmetrical
comp
onents (1, 3) with arms (11, 12, 31, 32) fan-like stretching apart with
orthodontic bands (40) or equivalent means fixed to said arms, these

components being articulated to one another about a hinge (5), and an
expansion screw (7) acting between said two components (1, 3) being able to

stretch them angularly apart by progressive actions on the screw, said arms
being anterior arms (12, 32) and posterior arms (11, 31) 
characterized in that

the posterior arms (11, 31) are inclined about 75Â° to the axis (X-X) in a general
anterior direction, while the anterior arms (12, 32) are inclined a smaller

angle than the posterior arms with respect to the axis (X-X) in a general
anterior direction where the axis (X-X) is the anterior-posterior axis in the

sagittal plane. 
Orthodontic apparatus according to the preceding
claim, 
characterized in that
 the screw (7) is
engaged with bushes (9) articulated (at 10) to said

components (1; 3) to ensure the alignment thereof
with the same screw.
Orthodontic apparatus according to the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 each of the two
components (1; 3) has its arms oriented forwards

with respect to the hinge, when the apparatus is in
its applied condition.
Orthodontic apparatus according to claim 3,

characterized in that
 either or both components is
provided with two arms.
