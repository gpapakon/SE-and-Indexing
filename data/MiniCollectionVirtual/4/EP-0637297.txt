<ABSTRACT>
Compounds, compositions, and method for modulating processes mediated by Retinoid X Receptors using retinoid-like compounds which have activity selective for members of the subclass of Retinoid X Receptors (RXRs), in preference to members of the subclass of Retinoic Acid Receptors (RARs). Examples of such compounds are bicyclic benzyl, pyridinyl, thiophene, furanyl, and pyrrole derivatives. The disclosed methods employ compounds for modulating processes selectively mediated by Retinoid X Receptors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to intracellular receptors and
ligands therefor. More specifically, this invention relates
to compounds having selective activity for specific
retinoic acid receptors, and methods for use of such
compounds.The vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid has long been
recognized to induce a broad spectrum of biological
effects. A variety of structural analogues of retinoic
acid have been synthesized that also have been found to be
bioactive. Some, such as Retin-A® (registered trademark
of Johnson & Johnson) and Accutane® (registered trademark
of Hoffmann-LaRoche), have found utility as therapeutic
agents for the treatment of various pathological conditions.
Metabolites of vitamin A and their synthetic
analogues are collectively herein called "retinoids".Synthetic retinoids have been found to mimic many of
the pharmacological actions of retinoic acid. However,
the broad spectrum of pharmacological actions of retinoic 
acid is not reproduced in full by all bioactive synthetic
retinoids.Medical professionals have become very interested in
the medicinal applications of retinoids. Among their uses
approved by the FDA is the treatment of severe forms of
acne and psoriasis. A large body of evidence also exists
that these compounds can be used to arrest and, to an
extent, reverse the effects of skin damage arising from
prolonged exposure to the sun. Other evidence exists that
these compounds may be useful in the treatments of a
variety of severe cancers including melanoma, cervical
cancer, some forms of leukemia, and basal and squamous
cell carcinomas. Retinoids have also shown an ability to
be efficacious in treating premalignant cell lesions, such
as oral leukoplakia, and to prevent the occurrence of
malignancy.Use of the retinoids is associated with a number of
significant side effects. The most serious of these is
that, as a class, they are among the most potent teratogens
known. Teratogens are compounds that cause severe
birth defects during specific periods of fetal exposure.
Other side effects include irritation of the tissues
treated, which can be so severe that patients cannot
tolerate treatment.Various investigations have been undertaken to
elucidate the structure-activity relationships governing
the abilities of synthetic retinoids to induce the various
pharmacological consequences of retinoic acid exposure.
This has been a complicated task, however, since the
assays available to investigators have been bioassays,
carried out either in intact animals or in isolated
tissues. Technical
