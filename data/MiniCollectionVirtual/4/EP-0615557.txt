<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
making high strength, low shrinkage polyamide yarn 
in a coupled, high-speed spin/draw 
process which is useful for high volume production of 
industrial polyamide yarns. High strength polyamide yarns are useful for a 
wide variety of industrial applications including use 
as reinforcement in tires, conveyor belts, hoses, and 
other reinforced rubber goods, use in plastic-coated 
fabrics, and in ropes, cordage, webbing, and woven 
fabrics. For reasons including cost reduction, energy 
savings, fabric yield, and end use product safety, 
converters of polyamide yarns to such uses desire the 
yarn to have a combination of properties including 
high tenacity and low shrinkage upon heating. 
Particularly desirable properties are a tenacity of at 
least about 9.5 g/d and a shrinkage of less than about 
4.0%. This combination of properties is difficult to 
produce, particularly in a high speed, coupled 
spin/draw process for high volume commercial 
production. Known coupled spin/draw processes for making 
multifilament polyamide yarns of high tenacity draw 
the spun filaments in at least two stages. In some 
known processes, the yarn is first drawn without 
heating often using snubbing pins in a first drawirg 
stage. The yarn is then heated in a second draw stage 
to enable drawing to greater than 5.0X draw ratio 
required for high tensile properties.  
 In processes of this type, the shrinkage will 
usually be quite high (over 10%) unless process steps 
are taken to decrease the shrinkage to a desired 
extent. The shrinkage can be significantly reduced by 
heating the yarn at high temperature at constant 
length and subsequently allowing it to retract/relax 
at elevated temperatures. In the coupled 
spin/draw/anneal process described in U.S. Patent 
3,311,691, the yarn is annealed by the hot second (and 
final) stage draw rolls and allowed to relax by 
operating the tension letdown rolls at a slower speed 
than the second stage rolls. The amount of 
retraction/relaxation of the yarn obtained in a 
process of this type can be described as percent (%) 
letdown which is defined for the purposes of this 
application as: 
% letdown = final stage draw roll speed - tension letdown roll speed100final stage draw roll speed 
There is an inverse relationship between % letdown of 
the spinning process and the resulting yarn shrinkage, 
i.e., a high % letdown results in a low shrinkage. In the process of U.S. Patent 3,311,691, it is 
difficult to string-up and operate a high

Process for making a high strength polyamide yarn 
comprising the coupled step of spinning the yarn, drawing the 

yarn (1) at least about 5.0X in stages including at least an 
initial draw stage (2 to 6) and a final draw stage (7 to 13) 

in which the yarn is contacted by and advanced between rolls 
which are rotated at successively higher peripheral speeds, 

said final draw stage employing final stage draw rolls (12, 
13) which are heated to above about 200°C, relaxing the yarn 

by advancing the yarn on at least one tension letdown roll 
(14, 15) which is rotated at a lower peripheral speed than 

said final stage draw rolls (12, 13), and winding up (18) the 
yarn at a speed greater than about 1829 m/min (2000 ypm), characterized by 


heating said yarn tension letdown roll (14, 15) to 
above about 200°C; 
rotating said tension letdown roll (14, 15) at a 
peripheral speed which is at least about 11% less than the 

peripheral speed of said final stage draw rolls (12, 13); and 
contacting the yarn between said final stage draw 
rolls (12, 13) and said tension letdown roll (14, 15) with 

tension control means (19, 20) for increasing the tension on 
said yarn advancing onto said tension letdown roll (14, 15). 
The process of claim 1 wherein said tension 
control means (19, 20) increases the tension on said yarn 

advancing onto said tension letdown roll (14, 15) sufficiently 
to stabilize yarn tracking and prevent slippage on said 

tension letdown roll. 
The process of claim 2 wherein said tension 
control means comprises at least one stationary, generally 

cylindrical snubbing pin (19, 20). 
The process of claim 3 wherein said snubbing pin 
(19, 20) is cooled to below about 50°C. 
The process of claim 3 wherein said snubbing pin  
 

(19, 20) has a diameter of between about 12,7 mm and 50,8 mm (0.5 and 2.0 inches). 
The process of claim 1 wherein said tension 
control means comprises two stationary, generally cylindrical 

snubbing pins (19, 20), each of said pins contacting the yarn 
on a portion of the pin surface with a total wrap angle 

between about 80° and 180°. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said yarn is 
poly(hexamethylene adipamide) yarn. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said winding up 
(18) of the yarn is performed at a speed of greater than about 

2400 ypm. 
The process of claim 1 when said tension letdown 
roll (14, 15) is heated to at least about 220°C.
