<ABSTRACT>
A free-flowing powder of coated particles is produced by means of a spray drying plant using a hot drying gas or a spray cooling plant using cold drying gas. A coating composition in liquid form is supplied to the atomizing means of the plant, and the liquid coating composition is atomized into a flow of liquid droplets, which are allowed to collide with particles of a carrier material dispersed in a transport gas. The direction and rate of flow of the transport gas are adapted to prevent contact between the drying gas and the droplets, so that the liquid coating composition, before any substantial drying thereof, will form a continuous liquid coating layer on the particles. The thus applied continuous coating layer on the particles is then allowed to at least partially dry by contact with the drying gas before withdrawal of the coated particles from the spray-drying chamber of the plant to a moving bed in the form of loose agglomerates. Suitable coating compositions are fat-containing emulsions containing proteins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for coating 
particles in a spray-drying plant. Coating of powder particles is desirable for many different 
reasons. Thus, e.g., coating may protect particles against 
humidity or oxidation. In connection with particles which are 
to be ingested, release of components from the particles 
during passage of the particles through the gastrointestinal 
system can be controlled by coating, e.g., in such a manner 
that the components in question are not released until after 
passage of the stomach. Coating of particles may also be a 
way of obtaining a slower release of active substances from 
the particles. Coating may cover an undesired taste, colour 
or texture of the particles. Furthermore, the coating may act 
as a protection against light and gasses. As will be explained in the following, coating may also 
improve the possibility of spray-drying solutions or dispersions 
which are otherwise difficult or impossible to 
spray-dry, because the coating process may be utilized to 
expose the solutions or dispersions in a thin layer with a 
large surface, thus greatly enhancing evaporation. Coating of powder particles may improve the handling of 
mixtures of powder products in which the individual components 
are to take part in a reaction which is initiated by 
decomposition of the coating. A known technique for coating powder particles comprises the 
use of a fluid bed plant. By means of this type of equipment, 
the powder particles are fluidized in air, the coating 
composition is atomized over the fluidized powder particles,  
 
and the coated particles are dried by continued passage in 
the fluid bed plant. This type of fluid bed treatment is suitable only when 
coating powder particles have a size which is several times 
larger than the droplets of the atomized coating composition. 
When the particles are only a few times larger than the 
droplet size or smaller, an agglomeration occurs which 
results in the particles gluing together in clusters with 
large interstices of air, which is normally an undesired 
effect in a coating process. In another technique, which is especially adapted for coating 
of relatively heavy particles in a fluid bed plant, a spray 
nozzle is placed at the bottom of a vertical tube in the 
centre of fluidized powder particles and atomizes the coating 
composition upwards through the tube and concurrent with the 
powder particles, which particles are carried upwards through 
the same tube by means of an air flow. When the powder
