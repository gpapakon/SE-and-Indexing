<ABSTRACT>
To achieve superior desilvering property and reduced 
stains even with the use of a biodegradable bleaching agent 

in a dilute concentration, the processing is conducted with a 
processing solution comprising a ferric complex salt of the 

compound of formula (I) or (II) and, for example, a 2-carboxypyridyl 
and having bleaching ability. (In the 

formulae, R₁ to R₅ represent, for example, a hydrogen atom or 
a carboxyl group, L₁ to L₅ represent, for example, an 

alkylene group, G₁ and G₂ represent, for example, a carboxyl 
group or an aryl group and X represents, for example, a 

hydrogen atom).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
processing a silver halide color photographic material, which
is superior in view of environmental conservation. In
particular, it relates to a method for processing a silver
halide color photographic material, which achieves excellent
biodegradation, is susceptible little to a photographically
adverse effect such as stain, and exhibits superior bleaching
ability.In general, a silver halide black-and-white
photographic material is processed through processing steps
such as black-and-white development, fixing and water washing
after exposure, and a silver halide color photographic
material (hereinafter referred to as color photographic
material) is processed through processing steps such as color
development, desilvering, water washing and stabilization
after exposure. A silver halide color reversal photographic
material is processed through processing steps such as black-and-white
development after exposure and color development,
desilverization, water washing and stabilization after
reversal processing. In the case of color development, exposed silver
halide grains are reduced to silver by a color developing
agent and the oxidation product of the color developing agent
reacts with a coupler to form an image dye during the color
development step.In the subsequent desilverization step, the developed
silver generated during development is oxidized (bleached) to
silver salt by the bleaching agent (oxidizing agent) and then
removed (fixed) from the light-sensitive layer together with
unexposed silver halide by the fixing agent capable of
forming a soluble silver. The bleaching and fixing may be
conducted separately as the bleaching step and the fixing
step or may be conducted simultaneously as the bleach-fixing
step. The details on these processing steps as well as on
the processing compositions therefor are described in James,
The Theory of Photographic Process, 4th ed. (1977), Research
sclosure No. 17643, Items 28 and 29, ibid., No. 18716, from
left column to right column at 651, ibid., No. 307105, Items
880 and 881.In addition to the above-described fundamental
processing steps, various auxiliary steps may be provided so
as to maintain photographic and physical qualities of the dye
image or to ensure the safety in processing. Examples
thereof include water washing step, stabilization step, film
hardening step and stopping step. Further, the developed silver halide black-and-white
photographic material is processed with a reducer containing
an oxidizing agent
