<ABSTRACT>
A main conveyer structure 3 incorporates a controller 
40 having function to control rotation of conveyer rollers 2. 

The controller 40 incorporates a plurality of I/O ports 42 for 
exchanging data signal with respective controllers 40 of 

conveyer units 1 adjoining in four directions. The I/O ports 
42 stores the numbers registered for respective conveyer units 

1 in the course of transmitting and receiving the registerable 
number to and from the controller 42, and then, based on the 

registered numbers stored in the I/O ports 42, the controller 
40 prepares a table for designating direction of driving 

respective conveyer units 1. By referring to the prepared 
table designating registered numbers of the start conveyer 

unit 1 and the destination conveyer unit 1, the controller 40 
correctly determines the direction of driving the rollers 2 

based on data for conveyance yielded from the table.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates a conveyor unit for
conveying loads, said conveyor unit comprising a main conveyor
structure for supporting said conveyor unit, a drive unit for
driving said conveyor unit and a controller for controlling
said drive unit.Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model
Publication No. HEI1-118905 of 1989 discloses such a conveyor unit.
According to this prior art, the main conveyor unit is
equipped with a number of rollers for conveying load, a drive
unit such as a motor for driving the rollers, and a transmission
unit comprising a pneumatic cylinder for transmitting and
cutting off drive force from the drive unit to these rollers.
Operations of the drive unit and the transmission unit are
respectively controlled by a controller unit internally
provided for the main conveyor unit.In order to form a conveyor line by linking a
plurality of conveyor units with each other, conventionally,
power-supply lines for feeding power to the drive unit and the
controller unit provided for each conveyor unit, signal
exchange lines linked with the controller unit to transmit and
receive signals to and from adjoining conveyor units, and air-supply
ducts for feeding air to the transmission unit composed
of a pneumatic cylinder, are discretely secured to each 
conveyor unit independent of adjoining conveyor units. Since
the above prior art also discretely provides the power-supply
lines, signal exchange lines, and air-supply ducts independent
of adjoining conveyor units, when forming complex conveyor
lines, installation work involves a great deal of labor and
much working time. When changing formation of the conveyor
line, operator is obliged to change arrangement of conveyor
units, power-supply lines, signal exchange linges, and air-supply
ducts in order to properly restructure the conveyor
line. This also obliges operator to change software applicable
to the controller unit. Since software cannot readibly be
changed by operator, layout cannot easily be changed. In
addition, as the scope of automation further expands, the number
of drive units and sensors further increases to result in
the increased number of signal exchange lines. In consequence,
proper arrangement can hardly be achieved in operating site,
and yet, completion of restructuring work may eventually be
delayed.A conveyor unit of the kind referred to in the
opening paragraph of this description is further known from
DE-C-3 827 903. This document describes a modular conveyor
system in which individual modules are connected to each other
mechanica
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A conveyor unit (1) for conveying loads (52),
said conveyor unit comprising a main conveyor structure (3) for

supporting said conveyor unit (1), a drive unit (5) for driving
the conveyor unit (1) forwardly and reversely and a controller

(6) for controlling said drive unit (5);

   
characterized in that:
said controller (6) registers therein registered numbers
set for each conveyor unit (1);
said controller (6) is provided with data transmitter-receiver

circuits (42) respectively connectable to a controller
of each adjoining conveyor unit in four selectable directions in

a horizontal plane in which the loads (52) are to be conveyed
by said conveyor unit (1), said directions including branching

directions
running perpendicular with respect to the axis of the conveyor

unit
in which loads are branched off by a

branching device;
each of said data transmitter-receiver circuits (42)
stores therein registered numbers of all of the other conveyor

units to be connected in the directions of said data transmitter-receiver
circuits (42);
controllers of the conveyor units located at each end
of a conveyance path composed of a plurality of said conveyor

units (1) connected to each other are provided wish an operation
box (51) for setting conveyance data consisting of the

registered number of a conveyor unit which starts conveyance
of loads and the registered number of a conveyor unit which

finally receives the loads;
said controller (6) is provided with a function to
transmit conveyance data set by the operation box (51), or the

conveyance data input from an adjoining conveyor unit, to the
controller of an adjoining conveyor unit through the data

transmitter-receiver circuit (42); and
said controller (6) is coupled to decision means (48)
which decide the direction of conveyance of loads on the basis

of the registered numbers of all the other conveyor units
which are stored in each data transmitter-receiver circuit 

(42), and the registered number of the conveyor unit which
starts conveyance of loads, and the registered number of a conveyor

unit which finally receives the loads, both of said latter
registered numbers being input from an adjoining conveyor

unit through said operation box (51), or said data-transmitter-receiver
circuits (42).
A conveyor unit (1) as set forth in claim 1,
wherein said decision means (48) provided for the controller

(6) is adapted to store in the data transmitter-receiver circuit
(42) the registered number of another conveyor unit when

said registered number is input through said data transmitter-receiver
circuit (42), and to output said input registered

number of the conveyor unit through another data transmitter-receiver
circuit than the one provided to input said registered

number.
A conveyor unit (1) as set forth in claim 1,
wherein said decision means (48) provided for the controller

(6) is adapted, when the data transmitter-receiver circuit is
connected with a branching conveyor unit, to store conveyance

directional data on loads to be branched off to said branching
conveyor unit in addition to the registered number of said

branching conveyor unit.
A conveyor unit (1) as set forth in claim 3,
wherein said decision means (48) of the controller (6) is

adapted to identify conveyance-impossible directions on the
basis of the branching directional data of the branching conveyor

unit, and defines said conveyance-impossible directions as
drive-impossible directions in a control table, thereby to decide

the direction of conveyance of loads on the basis of the control table
and conveyance data.
