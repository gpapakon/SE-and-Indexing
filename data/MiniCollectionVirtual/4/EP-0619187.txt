<ABSTRACT>
A numbering box (10) for a press for printing bank notes has 
a stack of sensor boards (30) in one-to-one correspondence 

with a stack of numbering wheels (11-18) and each of the 
boards (30) has an edge area (40) at the printing face of the 

numbering box which carries an LED indicator (42) of a status 
of magnetic signalling means (26) of the respective numbering 

wheel. The boards are each connected to a motherboard (46) in 
the numbering box. Data processing means (68) in the 

numbering box may be connected to a remote computer by an 
optical fibre link (76). The sensor boards are closely spaced 

and each has an aperture (48) to accommodate a bulky 
component of an adjacent board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for printing a 
distinctive and different index code on each successive 
one of a succession of documents. The device is useful in 
the printing of documents such as banknotes. It may also 
be useful for printing serial numbers on product labels 
and tickets. In security printing, successive value documents such as 
bank notes have to be printed with an individual serial 
number which uniquely identifies the particular printed 
document. This purpose is frequently served by numbering 
boxes which feature a coaxial stack of numbering wheels, 
each of these wheels having around its circumference a 
plurality of printing indicia which may be numbers or 
letters. At least one of the wheels is moved between the 
operation of printing each successive document, so that 
each document has its unique combination of printed 
indicia. Often, each bank note carries two impressions of 
the same unique serial number. Bank note printing presses 
are particularly large and complex presses. They may 
contain as many as 120 such numbering boxes. GB 2243580 A 
includes a description of such numbering boxes. In the 
present specification, the expression "numbering box" 
should be understood to include any module for printing 
indicia (whether numbers, letters or other signs) and 
printing elements which are not necessarily in the form of 
numbering wheels. In FR-A-2320187 the numerical values 
displayed at two numbering boxes are compared and a warning 
is generated if the numbers are not the same. If there is a malfunction in one or other of the numbering 
boxes, leading to the printing of documents with an 
incorrect serial number, the result for the printer is 
inconvenience and delay, at the very least. It will often 
be an unacceptable hazard to permit incorrectly numbered 
documents to continue to exist. For this reason, it would 
be advantageous to monitor the rotational positions of the  
 
numbering wheels, and to arrange for the press to be 
operated under the control of data processing equipment 
which constantly monitors the correct operation of 
numbering wheels and interrupts the operation of the press 
in the event that there is a malfunction which leads to 
selection of incorrect indicia. Manual resetting of a multiplicity of numbering boxes is 
very time-consuming. During the printing press revolution 
when a positional error on one numbering box is detected, 
only that specific box will require manual resetting after 
the press has been stopped. Should an additional

<CLAIMS>
A printing device (10) for printing distinctive and different 
index code on each successive one of a succession of 

documents, the device comprising: 

a plurality of print elements (11-18), mounted for 
movement to bring a selected one of a plurality of print 

indicia present around a locus disposed on a peripheral 
surface of the print element, into registry with a print 

face of the device; 
means (28) for monitoring the position of the print 
indicia relative to the print face; and characterised by: 
indicated means (42) corresponding to each print 
element, for providing a visual indication adjacent the 

print element of any discrepancy between the monitored 
position of the print element and a desired position 

thereof. 
A printing device as claimed in claim 1, which is a 
numbering box for installation at a point on the print 

face of a printing press element, and removable therefrom 
for such purposes as cleaning and maintenance of the 

numbering box or press element, the printing device 
comprising: 


data processing means (68) carried on the numbering 
box for (a) executing a program which prescribes 

successive print elements positions (b) comparing the 
monitored positions of each print element with the 

positions of that element prescribed by the program, and 
(c) outputting from the numbering box to the indicating 

means a signal indicative of any fault condition 
indicated by a discrepancy between the monitored and 

prescribed positions. 
A printing device as claimed in claim 2 wherein the 
indicating means is a light-emitting device which emits 

light while it is receiving the said signal. 
A printing device as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein 
the print elements are numbering wheels (11-18). 
A printing device as claimed in claim 4, having a coaxial 
stack of numbering wheels (11-18); 

and 

a stack of component-carrying circuit boards (30) 
for processing sensed rotational position data to 

determine a condition of any said numbering wheel; and 
wherein 
at least some of the circuit boards in the stack 
contain at least one through aperture (48) to accommodate 

a circuit component which is bulky in the thickness 
direction of the circuit boards of the stack. 
A printing device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the indicating means (42) is mounted on the 

print face of the device.  
 
A printing device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims wherein the monitoring means rely on the Hall effect, 

with each monitored element carrying means (26) to generate a 
magnetic field. 
A printing device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims and including an optical/electrical transducer to 

permit the device to correspond with a remote data processor 
by means of an optical fibre. 
A printing device as claimed in claim 8 and including an 
optical fibre rotary joint by means of which the optical 

fibre link with the remote data processor can cross between a 
stationary printing press structure and a rotatory printing 

press cylinder on which the printing device is mounted. 
A printing device as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, with a stack of numbering wheel printing elements 

(11-18) and a corresponding stack of respective circuit 
boards (30), a first edge area (32) of each circuit board
