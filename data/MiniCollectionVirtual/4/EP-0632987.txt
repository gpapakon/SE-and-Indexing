The invention relates to a mechanism for vertically raising and lowering the curtain rail (rod), without using a ladder. The mechanism comprises the curtain rod (main rod), supports, a braking device, cords (ropes or belts) and optionally attached hooks. The curtain rod is raised and lowered with the aid of the cords to which it is bound, the cords being guided through the openings of the supports and through the opening of the braking device. The braking device can be equipped with a cord for the arresting or freeing of the brake, with the intention of improved and more reliable functioning thereof. The building materials of the abovementioned devices and their components comply with all of those which are available on the market today or will be available in the future, may be of any desired form or shape, uncoloured or coloured in any desired shade. In addition, these components (curtain rod, supports, cords) can be coated, patterned or striped.
