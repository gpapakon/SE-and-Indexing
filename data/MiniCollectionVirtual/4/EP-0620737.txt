<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the 
use of lactoferrin for the manufacture 
of a medical preparation for the treatment of rheumatism. Lactoferrin, a protein existing in milk or 
tears of human being, bovine, etc., is known to have 
pharmacological effects such as antibacterial effect and 
proliferating effect of lymphocytes (JP-48534/1990, 
JP-A-1135726, FR-A-2651433). Lactoferrin is also known to 
act against free radical (FR-A-2596986, FR-A-2641696, 
Arthritis and rheumatism, vol. 27, nÂ° 4, 1984, New York, 
U.S.A., p. 462-467). However, it is desired to study potential 
effects of lactoferrin, a natural product, and expand the 
applications thereof. Thereupon, we studied to find new 
pharmacological effects of lactoferrin and found that 
lactoferrin was useful for treatment of rheumatism. It is 
noted that the two following documents study the effects of 
lactoferrin in inflammatory joint diseace : Phil. Trans. R. 
Soc. Lon. (1985) B 311, p. 659-71 ; Scandinavian J. of 
Chemical Investigations (1986), vol. 46, p. 695-704. 
However, no clear conclusion can be drawn from these 
documents on the effective effect of lactoferrin on this 
kind of diseace. It is expected that lactoferrin, a natural 
protein, has a possibility to be applied for treatment of 
various diseases. However, as the pharmacological effects 
of lactoferrin, only antibacterial effect and proliferating 
effect of lymphocytes etc. have been reported. Therefore, 
we studied to find new pharmacological effects of 
lactoferrin and found that lactoferrin was useful for  
 
treatment of rheumatism. An inhibitory effect of a medical substance 
against collagenase activity can be used as an index to 
examine the utility thereof for antirheumatic agent. The 
relationship of inhibitory effect against collagenase 
activity and rheumatism has been reported (W. H. Johnson 
et. al., J. Enzyme Inhibition, 2, 1 (1987) ; Woolley D. E. 
et. al., Arthritis Rheum., 20, 1231 (1977)). Therefore, we 
examined the inhibitory effect of lactoferrin against 
collagenase activity. As the result, we found that lactoferrin 
significantly inhibited the degradation of collagen caused 
by collagenase and showed excellent inhibitory effect 
against collagenase activity. The detailed experimental 
data are shown in the article of pharmacological test. Thus, this invention proposes to use 
lactoferrin for the manufacture of a composition for 
inhibit the collagenable activity in or on tissues 
containing collagenase enzyme, the composition containing 
the lactoferrin in
