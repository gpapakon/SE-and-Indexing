<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the protection of a construction (building) against earthquakes. The invention applies especially to already-existing constructions. The response of the construction under the effect of vibrations of the ground is calculated during the duration of an earthquake and the foundations (F) of the construction (B) and the ground deep down are joined together by a plurality of ties (T) (ground anchors) which do not have a load-bearing nature, having a length of at least ten metres, and which are anchored into the ground either by a device located at the end of the ties deep down or by a continuous connection between the ground and the ties along the latter, the said ties optionally being tensioned by a few tonnes, this tension being insufficient to preload the mass of earth, at least some of the ties being inclined and at least some of the ties pointing in directions which intersect in projection in at least one vertical plane, the said inclined ties meeting points which, under the effect of the earthquake, have different amplitudes of movement, the positioning and sizing of the said ties being calculated for each orientation of the earthquake so that the set of ties gives the construction the smallest amplitude of movement.
