<ABSTRACT>
A system for allocating communication channels within a cellular radio system in which each channel seizure request is assigned a call type based upon the capabilities of the mobile station, the nature of the call and the characteristics of the subscriber. A first algorithm is used to select a communication channel group for the call and a second algorithm is used to select an available communication channel from within the selected channel group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cellular radio communication
systems and, more particularly, to the selection of radio
communication channels in such systems.When cellular radio systems were first implemented,
specific frequencies within a basic frequency range were
assigned for communication between fixed radio base
stations and mobile subscribers using analog modulation
techniques. Correspondingly, the mobile radio
transceivers available to mobile subscribers at that time
were capable of transmitting and receiving radio signals
only on the assigned radio frequencies within the basic
frequency range and could communicate only with analog
modulation techniques.As the use of cellular radio systems increased over
the years, the limited number of basic frequencies
assigned by the communications authorities for cellular
usage became increasingly congested. This led to the
frequent occurrence of call blockages due to the
unavailability of a communication channel frequency for
use by a calling or called subscriber. To decrease the
level of congestion in cellular radio systems, an
additional frequency range, referred to as the extended
frequencies, was assigned for use by cellular radio
systems. This addition made available an increased
number of communication channels in each system, the
added frequency channels all lying in the extended
frequency band, to accommodate a greater amount of 
traffic and an increased number of subscribers. However,
new mobile transceivers needed to be designed and
manufactured which would communicate not only on radio
channels within the "basic frequency" range, but also on
radio channels within the "extended frequency" range. At
this time all communications in both frequency ranges
took place using analog modulation. However, since there
would then be mobile transceivers operating within the
system which were capable of operating in both the basic
and extended frequency ranges, as well as mobile
transceivers which could only operate within the basic
frequency range, it became necessary to have each mobile
station identify to the system its frequency capabilities
upon seeking access to a communication channel so that a
channel assignment could then be made in accordance with
the specific frequency capabilities of the requesting
mobile transceiver.When digital modulation techniques began to be used
on the radio communication channels available between a
base station and a mobile, newer subscriber units were
provided with transceivers of the so-called "dual mode"
type. Such mobile
