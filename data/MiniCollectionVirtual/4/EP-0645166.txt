<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists of a slant top cabinet for a 
video game where the video monitor is located beneath a door. 

The side edges of the door mate with gutters such that liquid 
spilled into the seam of the door will drain into the gutters 

away from the monitor. A rubber seal is attached to and 
surrounds the monitor such that liquid spilled on the screen or 

game top will drain into the rubber seal. The rubber seal 
includes a port that connects to a conduit for draining liquid 

from the rubber seal away from the monitor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates, generally, to video game
machines and, more particularly, to a liquid drain system for
isolating the video monitor.Video games typically consist of a game cabinet
supporting a video monitor and a plurality of player operated
buttons. The video monitor displays a game as directed by the
game program and the player manipulates buttons to control play
of the game. The player operated buttons can consist of
mechanical buttons located on the cabinet or video "buttons"
displayed on the monitor for screen touch control or both. Where
screen touch control is used, the video monitor screen must be
exposed to allow the game player to touch the screen. It is
necessary in applications using screen touch control to isolate
the monitor and other game electronics from the external
environment to prevent electrical hazards.Video game machines are used to play a wide variety of
games including sports and fantasy games in arcades and the like.
Video games have also become widely used in casinos and other
legalized gambling sites for playing video poker, blackjack, keno
and the like. In some video games the video monitor is arranged
with its screen substantially vertical. For example, Fogelman,
U.S. Patent 4,440,457 ("Fogelman") describes an electronic video
game cabinet, including an upstanding box-like structure. In
contrast, in the machines used in gambling games the monitors are 
more typically arranged with the screen at approximately a 30Â° angle relative to the
horizontal. In these so-called "slant top" games, the player sits in front of the
machine with the video screen and cabinet top oriented like a desk.A particular problem with slant top games that use screen touch control is that
game players often spill drinks on the game and video screen. Because video
monitors operate at high voltage, the seepage of liquid into the electronics of the game
presents a safety hazard. In other forms of prior art, such as Rohne and Wolf, DD
267,862 ("Rohne"), an upright Cathode Ray Tube ("CRT") is disclosed with a dust
proof and splash proof seal installed between the screen diaphragm and the display
screen to attempt to prevent liquid from seeping into the CRT..Thus, a video game cabinet that protects the video monitor and game
electronics from liquid and, in addition, removes the liquid from the machine, is
desired.According to the present invention there is provided a seal and drain system
for a video game machine, comprising:
a game cabinet, said game cabinet housing a video monitor including a video

<CLAIMS>
A seal and drain system for a video game
machine (1), comprising:


a) a game cabinet (2),
b) said game cabinet (2) housing a video
monitor (10) including a video screen (16)

and supported in said game cabinet (2),
c) a seal (30) surrounding and secured to said
video monitor (10), said seal (30)

preventing the fluid from contacting the
video monitor (10),
characterized in that
 the top of said game cabinet (2) is slanted and
includes a door (14) moveable between a closed position and an

open position, said door having an aperture (12) located therein,
and said video screen (16) is exposed through said aperture (12),

and said seal (30) consisting of a flexible material and contacting said door (14) when it is in the
closed position, said seal also including a collector(38) for

collecting fluid spilled on the machine (1), a receptacle (40)
for receiving the fluid from the collector and delivery means (44) for delivering

the fluid to a location external to the game cabinet (2).
The seal and drain system according to claim 1,
wherein said seal (30) is substantially v-shape in cross section

having a first leg (32) fixed to the screen (16) and a second
leg (36) extending from the first leg (32), a trough (33) being 

created between the first leg (32) and second leg (36) for
receiving fluid therein.
The seal and drain system according to claim 1,
wherein when said door (14) is in the closed position a seam is

created between said door (14) and the rest of said game
cabinet (2), and further including a gutter (18,20) located below

the seam to prevent fluid from entering said game cabinet (2) via
said seam.
The seal and drain system according to claim 3,
wherein said door (14) includes a flange (24,26) that engages the

gutter (18,20).
