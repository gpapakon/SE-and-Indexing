<ABSTRACT>
An output driver circuit has a circuitry portion (70) which is 
used to generate a Drive-Hi control signal in response to an Output 

Enable, an optional Precondition signal, and a Data Input signal. A 
circuit portion (75) ensures that the Drive-Hi control signal is 

maintained at a voltage which is substantially equal to Vdd when 
the Output Enable is deactivated. Circuit portion (80) selectively 

controls the Data Output by driving Vdd onto the Data Output in 
response to the Drive-Hi control signal being activated. A circuit 

portion (100) functions to selectively drive the Data Output to a 
logic zero (ground potential) when a Drive-Lo signal is asserted. 

Circuit portions (90 and 95) generate the Drive-Lo signal in 
response to the Output Enable, the optional Precondition signal, 

and the Data Input signal. In general, the output driver circuit 
allows an integrated circuit powered at a first voltage to 

interface to another integrated circuit which is powered at a 
higher second voltage without loss of performance, without 

excessive leakage currents, without crossover current, and 
without increasing gate oxide stresses

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to semiconductor
circuits, and more particularly, to output buffers for integrated
circuits.Output driver circuits are designed into semiconductor
integrated circuits in order to allow integrated circuits to
communicate with circuitry external to the integrated circuit via
integrated circuit pins. In most cases, a group of output and/or
input conductors of an integrated circuit are referred to
collectively as a bus. A bus is a group of conductive lines that
interconnect several integrated circuits. In most cases, many of
the several integrated circuits contain driver circuits that
selectively influence the voltage potential of one or more
conductors within the bus. For example, a data line or data bus
may connect several integrated circuits into a system wherein
each integrated circuit is either a microprocessor, an analog
device, a memory device, or any other known integrated circuit.
Each of the integrated circuits may operate from a different
power supply voltage potential. For example, one integrated
circuit may operate at five volts, another integrated circuit may
operate at 3.3 volts, and yet another integrated circuit may
operate at two volts.Furthermore, in order to increase the number of transistors
on an integrated circuit, reduce power dissipation, and increase
circuit operational speed, circuit and device geometric
dimensions are being gradually reduced through time. The reduced
devices are less able to withstand internal integrated circuit
electric fields, and are vulnerable to damage and reduced
performance when high electric fields are present. In addition,
gate oxides of transistors are becoming thinner through time. 
Thin gate oxides are more susceptible to known and understood
reliability failure and breakdown problems than thick gate oxides.
Also, channel lengths are being reduced over time. Reduced
channel lengths result in known and undesirable hot carrier
injection (HCI) effects. In order to overcome the problems listed
above, integrated circuits are now being designed for use with
lower power supply voltages. For example, 3.3 volts is currently
replacing five volts in the industry, and voltages lower than 3.3
volts are expected to be widely used in the near future.The lower power supply voltages solved many of the
problems listed above, but resulted in a new problem that must be
solved. The new problem is that it is difficult to interface two
integrated circuits or two integrated circuit drivers which
operate at different supply voltages.To
