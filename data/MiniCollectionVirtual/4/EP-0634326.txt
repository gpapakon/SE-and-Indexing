<ABSTRACT>
A filling valve for use in a container-filling 
plant or the like is disclosed, which valve is provided 

with movable closure means (4) which are biassed to 
close the filling valve, characterised in that the 

filling valve further comprises: 

i) a flexible sealing member (10) adapted to 
provide a seal between the mouth of a container (6) to 

be filled and the filling valve when the filling valve 
is in use, and 
ii) opening means (7) adapted to move said 
movable closure means (4) by a predetermined amount so 

as to open the filling valve when a container (6) is to 
be filled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve for use in 
bottle and container filling equipment. In the bottling and filling industry, there is a 
need to be able to fill bottles and containers to a 
high degree of accuracy, particularly in the case of 
large filling plant, where even a very slight overfill 
per bottle can lead to a substantial erosion of profit 
margins over an extended period of time. It is 
particularly difficult when using existing filling 
machinery accurately to fill non-rigid containers such 
as plastic milk containers. Two main forces are necessary for the operation of 
a filling valve. The first force is that which is 
required to seal the top of the container against the 
filling unit. The second force is that which is 
required to open the valve. This second force is 
generally high in order to prevent leakage through the 
filling valve when closed. With existing filling 
valves, the container to be filled is used to apply 
both these forces. Since the force required to open 
the valve is large, this can lead to distortion of the 
container and consequently to inconsistent fill levels. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a filling valve which comprises a 
filling member provided with movable closure means, 
which closure means are urged by resilient means to 
close the filling valve, characterised in that there is 
provided: 
i) a flexible sealing member on said filling 
valve, which sealing member is adapted to provide a 
seal between the mouth of a container to be filled and 
the filling valve when the filling valve is in use, and ii) a controllable filling valve opening 
mechanism which is adapted to move said movable closure 
means against said resilient means by a predetermined  
 
amount so as to open the filling valve when a container 
is to be filled. According to another aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a filling valve provided 
with movable closure means, which closure means are 
biassed to close the filling valve, characterised in 
that the filling valve further comprises: 
i) a flexible sealing member adapted to provide 
a seal between the mouth of a container to be filled 
and the filling valve when the filling valve is in use, 
and ii) opening means adapted to move said movable 
closure means by a predetermined amount so as to open 
the filling valve when a container is to be filled. The flexible sealing member is arranged so that a 
container to be filled may be held against the filling 
valve in an air-tight manner

<CLAIMS>
A filling valve provided with movable closure 
means (4), which closure means (4) are biassed (1) to 

close the filling valve, characterised in that the 
filling valve further comprises: 


i) a flexible sealing member (10) adapted to 
provide a seal between the mouth of a container (6) to 

be filled and the filling valve when the filling valve 
is in use, and 
ii) opening means (7) adapted to move said 
movable closure means (4) by a predetermined amount so 

as to open the filling valve when a container (6) is to 
be filled. 
A filling valve as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the flexible sealing member (10) has a 

predetermined range of flexibility allowing the seal 
between the mouth of the container (6) and the filling 

valve to be maintained over a predetermined range of 
relative dispositions. 
A filling valve as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the opening means (7) is adapted to move the 

closure means (4) through a range delimited by the 
range of flexibility of the flexible sealing member 

(10). 
A filling valve as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 
3, wherein the opening means (7) is controlled by way 

of a cam rail (14). 
A filling valve as claimed in any preceding 
claim, further comprising override means (15) arranged 

to provide a secondary level of valve control in 
addition to the opening means (7). 
A filling valve as claimed in claim 5, 
wherein the override means (15) comprises a cam which, 

in use, may be actuated to control the movement of the 
movable closure means (4). 
A filling valve as claimed in any preceding 
claim, further comprising weighing means which, in use, 

is arranged to monitor the weight of a container (6) 
being filled. 
A filling valve as claimed in claim 7, 
further comprising control means which, in use, is 

arranged to control the opening means (7) in response 
to signals generated by the weighing means.
