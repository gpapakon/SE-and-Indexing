<ABSTRACT>
An input device (10) is provided for selecting a mixed beverage, in response to which a plurality of individual manually operated beverage dispensers (14) will dispense predetermined quantities of the beverages to make up a selected mix. Indicators (18) can also be used to inform the bartender that the dispenser is preset to measure the predetermined quantity. A calculating system (20) may be used to calculate the value of the consumption of the beverages, based on measured quantity and the kind of mixed beverage in which the various beverages are used. The system includes an improved bottle dispenser, electromagnetic valve bottle stopper code identifier, and anti-tamper circuit for use with the coded bottle stopper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for controlling 
the dispensing of beverages in a bar. Bar control systems according to the preamble of claim 1 are known in the art. US patent 
3,920,149 (Fortino et al.) describes a liquor bottle 
stopper and electromagnetic valve system which records 
use of up to seven different kinds of liquor. UK patent 
2,116,763 describes a bar system in which consumption of 
various beverages are monitored and controlled by a 
central system. It is also known to provide apparatus 
which automatically prepare a mixed drink. While these prior art systems can be used to effectively 
monitor beverage consumption in a bar for inventory and 
cost purposes or to prepare a mixed drink, they do not 
assist the bartender in his preparation of drinks, while 
allowing him to serve drinks of a variety of kinds from 
a variety of dispensers or containers. For example, a bar may have a wine dispenser and a soda 
dispenser. Each dispenser may be metered to monitor 
consumption for inventory and cost purposes. When a 
customer requests a glass of wine or a glass of soda 
water, the dispensers are used directly by the bartender, 
and charged accordingly. However, when the customer wants 
a spritzer (wine and soda mix), a smaller quantity of 
wine is mixed with a smaller quantity of soda to make up 
the mixed drink. In the prior art systems, consumption of 
the beverages is monitored without regard to how the 
beverages are used to determine what revenue should be 
generated from the loss in inventory for each separate 
case (the cost per 28 g (ounce) for the wine is more in 
a spritzer than in a simple glass).  
 It is an object of the invention to provide a system for 
controlling the dispensing of beverages in a bar, which 
monitors consumption and estimates revenue from the 
consumption. It is another object of the invention to 
provide a system which works with a plurality of 
individually operated beverage dispensers for metering 
and dispensing a plurality of beverages, so that the 
bartender may dispense in the conventional manner any of 
the beverages to make up a drink. According to the invention, there is provided a system 
for controlling the dispensing of beverages in a bar, 
comprising: a plurality of individual manually operated 
beverage dispensers for metering and dispensing a 
plurality of beverages upon command by a user ; characterised in that it comprises selecting 
means for selecting a preprogrammed beverage mix by the 
user; and control means for controlling the

<CLAIMS>
A system for controlling the dispensing of beverages 
in a bar, comprising: 


a plurality of individual manually operated 
beverage dispensers (14) for metering and dispensing a 

plurality of beverages upon command by a user; characterised in that it comprises : 
selecting means (10) for selecting a preprogrammed 
beverage mix by the user; and 
control means (16) for controlling said plurality of 
beverage dispensers to dispense preprogrammed quantities 

of beverage making up the selected preprogrammed beverage 
mix when the selecting means indicate that a mix has been 

selected; whereby the system allows the user to obtain 
quantities of beverages by use of the plurality of 

beverage dispensers without using the selecting means and 
to prepare a preprogrammed beverage mix by using the 

selecting means and the plurality of beverage dispensers. 
The system as defined in claim 1, further comprising 
a plurality of indicators (18) associated with said beverage 

dispensers (14) for indicating when the control means (16) have set 
the preprogrammed ones of the plurality of beverage 

dispensers to dispense preprogrammed quantities of 
beverage making up the selected preprogrammed beverage 

mix, such that the user is aware that the beverage 
dispensers whose indicators are active will dispense the 

preprogrammed quantity as controlled by the control 
means. 
The system as defined in claim 1, further comprising 
calculating means (20) for determining an estimated value of 

the beverages dispensed, based on metered quantities of 
the beverages dispensed and the state of the selection 

means, whereby a different value per volume of the 
beverages may be calculated for a given beverage making 

up the selected preprogrammed beverage mix.  
 
The system as defined in claim 2, wherein the 
indicators each comprise an LED. 
The system as defined in claim 1, wherein the 
selecting means comprise a keypad having an input key (12) for 

each beverage mix. 
The system as defined in claim 1, wherein the 
plurality of beverage dispensers (14) comprise coded 

electromagnetic valve bottle stoppers (24) and an activating 
coil means. 
The system as defined in claim 6, wherein said control 
means comprise measuring means for selecting a 

predetermined quantity to be dispensed by said stoppers 
and activating coil means, whereby measured quantities of 

beverages can be dispensed without using the selection 
means. 
The system as defined in claim 3, further comprising 
user identification means (26) for preventing unauthorized use 

of the beverage dispensers and for allowing the 
calculating means to determine the value of beverages 

dispensed for each of a plurality of users. 
The system as defined in claim 1, wherein said control 
means function as a cash register, the selecting means 

providing to said control means details of an order of 
beverages. 
The system as defined in claim 6, further comprising 
a magnet detection circuit for producing an output signal 

in response to a movement of a magnet, the control means 
producing a tamper alarm signal when said output signal 

is detected in the absence of said activator coil being 
energized.
