<ABSTRACT>
Injector for introducing solid objects (10), such as transponders, in 
living beings. To overcome the problem that the transponders must be 

kept in correct position near the extremity of the hollow needle of the 
injector clamping means are provided in the hollow needle or tube to 

engage the article. These clamping means (4) are realized such that the 
push rod (3) is not restricted in its movement whilst it is relatively 

easy to move the transponder out of engagement from the clamping means 
by this push rod.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to an injector for 
introducing solid objects, such as transponders, in living 
beings, comprising a hollow tube for receiving the object and 
a push rod displaceable in said hollow tube to transfer the 
object to be injected. Such an injector is generally known in the art. E.g. 
reference is made to the Netherlands patent application 
9100160. In this patent specification an injector is 
described in which a push rod removes transponders from a 
cartridge in a hollow tube. This tube has to be inserted 
under the skin of a living being after which either by 
displacing of the push rod or by retracting of the needle or 
by a combined movement the transponder is placed in position. However, it has been noticed that problems arise 
during transfer of the injector after the push rod has 
removed one of the transponders from the cartridge. The 
transponder can move freely in front of the push rod. Also in 
other embodiments wherein no cartridge is used, but instead 
of that the transponder is simply placed from the front end 
of the hollow needle in abutment with the transponder there 
is a substantial danger that the transponder gets astray 
during movement of the injector. It has been proposed to use an ointment to keep the 
transponder engaged within the hollow needle or tube. 
Although this will prevent getting astray of the transponder 
it will also result in that ointment will remain in the tube 
and can absorb dirt from the surroundings and germs of a 
disease and so on from the animal which can be subsequently 
transferred to the next animal which has to be provided with 
a transponder. To prevent this it is necessary to clean the 
needle tip after each injection or to odd strongly 
disinfecting components to the ointments which will, however, 
decrease its effect during injection in the related animal. Instead of using an ointment it is desirable to use a 
liquid. The chances that residues remain are less and it will  
 
not attract the surrounding dirt. Furthermore some 
medications are only available in liquid condition and not as 
ointment. The invention aims to provide a solution for the 
problem to keep the transponder in its position within the 
hollow injector tube and being free whether or not to add any 
ointment, liquid or nothing at all. According to the invention it is realized with an 
injector of the type described above in that clamping means 
are provided in the hollow tube to engage the object. 
According to the invention the object is kept mechanically
