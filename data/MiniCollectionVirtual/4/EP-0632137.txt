<ABSTRACT>
Process for the heat treatment of metallic articles such as steel components which distort easily, by means of a roller furnace and presses (so-called quenches) cooperating with the latter. The articles are raised to a predetermined temperature and cooled in accordance with a predetermined characteristic for the cooling rate. After reaching the predetermined temperature, the articles pass out at very high speed through a rapid discharge region of the roller furnace at an even higher temperature, the press parts exerting on the metallic articles pressures which vary as a function of time during the cooling process.

<CLAIMS>
Method for thermal treatment of easily deforming steel
parts such as sheet metal, rondes and similar materials by

means of a roller furnace and presses cooperating therewith
(so-called "Quetten"), in which the material


is brought to a predetermined temperature T, and
is cooled between press parts at a predetermined
developement of cooling rate,
wherein each steel part, having reached the predetermined
temperature T, passes through a region of rapid discharge

of the roller furnace at a temperature T

 being
about 100Â°C higher as the curing temperatures usually

striven for up to now (austenite forming temperature), at
a speed of 20 to 40 mm/s or of 150-300 mm/s,
wherein the press parts exert time-dependingly alternating
pressures on the steel part during the cooling process such

that after a phase of high pressure occurs a decrease of
the pressure, during which only the dead weight of the top

press part acts upon the steel part.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
press parts operate pulsatingly.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that the
press parts depending on the material are under pressure

for about 3 sec., whereupon follows a period of 3 sec.,
during which the presses exert only the dead weight on the

metallic material.
