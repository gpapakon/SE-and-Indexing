<ABSTRACT>
In a low floor railway vehicle with a stepless central passage in which adjacent coach bodies are connected to one another at one point so as to be spatially movable, a pair of wheels or wheel set being assigned to each end of a coach body and the pairs of wheels being connected to the pairs of wheels or to the wheel set of an adjacent coach body via a running gear frame or a bogey, and it being possible for the pairs of wheels or wheel sets to be driven or not driven, the pairs of wheels are guided by means of links between the running gear frames or bogey frames and coach body in such a way that the pairs of wheels assume an approximately or exactly radial position as a function of the position of the coach body in a bend in the track.

<CLAIMS>
A low-floor rail vehicle with a continuous central 
corridor without steps or ramps, in which adjacent wagon 

bodies (1,4,5,4',5',4'',5'') are joined together at a point 
so as to be movable spatially,
 
wherein a wheel pair (3,18, 19, 18', 19', 29, 30) or 

wheel set is associated with each wagon body end, and the 
wheel pairs (3,18,19;18',19') are connected to the wheel 

pairs (3,18, 19, 18', 19', 29, 30) or wheel sets of an 
adjacent wagon body (1,4,5,4',5',4'',5'') via a running 

gear frame (12,12',26) or a bogie, and the wheel pairs or 
the wheel sets are driven or non-driven,
 
characterised in that the wheel pairs 

(3,18,19,18',19',29,30) are respectively guided on a 
wheel guiding frame (16,16',27,28) which is connected via 

a primary suspension system (161,161') to the running 
gear frame (12,12',26) or bogie frame and to the 

associated wagon body (1,4,5,4',5',4'',5'') via links 
(10,10',11,11',24,25,24',25'), which are positioned 

obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, such 
that, during straight travel, all the links 

(10,10',11,11',24,25,24',25') are positioned at the same 
angle, and during travel round curves, the link on the 

inside of the curve in each case is deflected out more 
than the link on the outside of the curve. 
A low-floor rail vehicle according to Claim 1,  
 

characterised in that the wheel pairs 
(3,18,19,18',19',29,30) are connected longitudinally 

elastically to the running gear- or bogie frame 
(12,12',26) via the primary suspension system (161,161') 

and rigidly to the wagon body (1,4,5,4',5',4'',5'') via the 
links (10,10',11,11',24,25,24',25'). 
A low-floor rail vehicle according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the wheel pairs (3,18,19,18',19') 

are connected longitudinally elastically to the running 
gear- or bogie frame (12,12',26) via the primary 

suspension system (161,161') and longitudinally 
elastically to the wagon body (1,4,5,4',5',4'',5'') via 

links (10,10',11,11',24,25,24',25'), which are mounted 
with radial yielding in bushes (32). 
A low-floor rail vehicle according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the longitudinal characteristic of 

the spring system comprising the primary suspension 
system (161,161') and bushes (32) is adapted to the force 

resulting from the wheel-rail geometry such that the 
elastically linked wheel pairs (3,18,19,18',19',29,30) 

adjust over-radially in dependence on the radius of the 
curve.
