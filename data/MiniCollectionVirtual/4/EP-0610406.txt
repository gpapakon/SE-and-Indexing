<ABSTRACT>
Polyamide resin compositions containing 82-93 % by weight of a non-crystalline polyamide, 5-12 % by weight of an ethylene-propylene terpolymer, and 2.5-6 % by weight of a thermoplastic, semicrystalline polyamide resin are found to have high impact resistance and high energy absorption characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE POLYAMIDE RESIN COMPOSITIONS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to polyamide resin compositions having high impact resistance, high energy absorption characteristics, excellent moldability and coating properties, and low specific gravity. The compositions are useful in the production of the molded products requiring such characteristics.There are known impact-resistant polyamide resin compositions which are based on semi- or non-polyamides and compounded with at least 20% by weight of an ethylene-propylene terpolymer (called hereafter EPDM) for improving the impact resistance (see, e.g., Japanese Patent Kokoku 55-44108). Such compositions have been proposed for use in molded products requiring impact resistance, such as automotive bumpers, a fenders for automobiles, motorcycles, snowmobiles, traveling suitcases, trunks, helmets, or the like.Those polyamide resin compositions which are based on semi- or non-polyamides and compounded with EPDM, because of their high impact resistance, are suitable for the production of the molded products requiring impact resistance. If the products are molded thinner to reduce the weight, however, their elongation at break becomes low thus leading to a breakage of the molded products by small external force. Therefore, polyamide resin compositions have been demanded which have high elongation at break and nevertheless have high rigidity, thus exhibiting excellent energy absorption when an external force is applied.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a polyamide resin composition with high impact resistance and high energy absorption characteristics which consists of a polymer blend comprising 82 to 93% by weight of a non- crystalline resin, 2 to 12% by weight of EPDM, and 2.5 to 6% by weight of a thermoplastic, semicrystalline polyamide resin.The invention also provides a polyamide resin molded product wherein such polyamide resin composition is used in the production of the molded parts requiring the energy absorption characteristics. 

 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSFig. 1 is a graph showing a change in breaking energy relative to a change in the content of EPDM and 66 nylon in the polyamide resin composition. Fig.2 is a plan view of a helmet molded from the polyamide resin composition of the present invention.Fig.3 is a sectional view taken substantially along the lines I-I of Fig.2.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on the discovery that reducing to7.5-18% by weight the contents of EPDM
