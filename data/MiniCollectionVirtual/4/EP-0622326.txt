<ABSTRACT>
A balustrade assembly is provided having a shaped 
panel holder (28) for supporting a balustrade panel 

(24), an outer decking (60) and an inner profile (62). 
The inner profile, outer decking and panel holder 

include a clip apparatus (66) which enables the outer 
decking and inner profile to be attached to the panel 

holder in a constant aligned position, independent of 
the balustrade panel. A method of assembling a 

balustrade assembly is also provided including the steps 
of providing a balustrade panel for supporting a 

handrail (22), a shaped panel holder, an inner profile, 
an outer decking, and apparatus for clipping the panel 

holder, the inner profile, and the outer decking 
together. The steps further include attaching the outer 

decking to the panel holder with the clip apparatus, 
independent of the balustrade panel, attaching the 

balustrade panel to the panel holder, and attaching the 
inner profile to the panel holder with the clip 

apparatus, independent of the balustrade panel and in a 
constant aligned position with the outer decking and the 

panel holder.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to people moving devices in
general, and balustrades therefor in particular.Escalators, moving walkways, and other people
moving devices efficiently move a large volume of
pedestrian traffic from one point to another.
Passengers step on moving steps (or belts, or pallets)
and are transported along at a constant rate of speed.
For safety reasons, passenger handrails are provided,
travelling in the same direction and speed as the steps.
A balustrade assembly supports and guides one of the
handrails on each side of the steps.Each balustrade assembly includes balustrade panels
(typically glass) which extend up from a base to support
the handrail. Externally, the base consists of a number
of enclosure panels, including an outer decking, an
outer cladding, an inner profile, and a skirt panel.
The outer decking and outer cladding enclose the
mechanics on the side of the balustrade panel opposite
the moving steps. The inner profile and skirt panel
enclose the mechanics adjacent the moving steps.Within the base, there are a number of ways known
to support the balustrade and enclosure panels.
Typically, the balustrade panel is supported by a panel
holder fixed to a bracket welded to the frame of the
escalator. The enclosure panels are supported by
brackets fixed to the frame or by brackets fixed to the
panel holder. Alternatively, the enclosure panels may
be directly attached to the panel holders.It is known in the art that a desirable balustrade
design must provide a rigid structure which supports the
balustrade panel and prevents the public from accessing
the balustrade mechanics and moving handrail within. 
However, a desirable balustrade must also allow access
to the enclosed mechanics, must be easily manufactured
and assembled, and must be as inexpensive as possible.
These requirements, however, are often at odds with one
another. For example, a balustrade design which rigidly
supports the balustrade panel and provides a strong,
impenetrable enclosure is often expensive and difficult
to assemble. On the other hand, if lighter, less
expensive materials are used which rely on geometry to
provide rigidity, these structures often make access
within the balustrade difficult. What is needed is a
balustrade which provides a rigid support for the
handrail and which is easily manufactured and assembled,
while allowing ease of maintenance at a reasonable cost.US-A-4690264 discloses a balustrade assembly having
a balustrade panel for supporting a handrail,
comprising:
a shaped panel holder,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A balustrade assembly having a balustrade panel
(24) for supporting a handrail (22), comprising:


a shaped panel holder (28), having a length;
an inner profile (62);
an outer decking (60); and
means (66) for clipping said panel holder, said
inner profile, and said outer decking together, wherein

said clip means enables said inner profile and said
outer decking to be attached to said panel holder in a

constant aligned position, relative to said panel holder
and to each other, independent of the balustrade panel;

   characterised in that said clip means comprises:

an inner support (70), having a width, for
supporting and maintaining the position of said inner

profile relative to said panel holder, said inner
support having a trim clip (94) and an attachment clip

(96-100), wherein said attachment clip attaches said
inner support to said panel holder, and said trim clip

holds an inner trim molding (104) in between said inner
profile and the balustrade panel; and
an outer support (68), having a width (72), for
supporting and maintaining the position of said outer

decking relative to said panel holder, said outer
support comprising a retaining means (78), a snap clip

(76), and an attachment clip (74), wherein said
attachment clip attaches said outer support to said

panel holder, and said retaining means and said snap
clip attach said outer decking to said outer support,
