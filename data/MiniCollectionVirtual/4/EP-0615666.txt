<ABSTRACT>
A cable duct for horizontally drawn cables (13) includes a base part (4) which is intended to be mounted relative to a wall, and upper and lower shelves (5, 6) which extend out from mutually opposing longitudinal edges of the base part. The lower shelf (6) is provided with cable throughlets. The duct has a front covering (2, 3) which is divided along the length of the duct into two or more front parts, of which at least one front part (3) is movably mounted in at least one neighbouring front part (2), which in turn can be snapped into fittings (9) provided in the shelves (5, 6) adjacent their outer edges. The snap-over front part (2) includes flanges (16) which project out form a cover panel (15) which grip around longitudinally extending grooves (9) in the shelves (5, 6) and which have inwardly angled outer end-parts (17) which resiliently engage these grooves. Detachably insertable buckling-resistant spacing members (26) are fitted in the interspace between the shelves (5, 6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cable trunk or duct 
according to the preamble of Claim 1. A cable duct or trunk which includes concealed electric 
sockets, or corresponding outlets, is illustrated in CH-A-512,841. 
In the case of the known cable duct, the 
lower shelf has an inner shelf part which extends along 
the full length of the duct, and a plurality of mutually 
spaced intermediate shelf parts. These shelf parts are 
detachably hung on a strip which projects up from the 
outer edge of the inner shelf part, and support, in turn, 
detachably along their outer edge a rail which is 
provided in the upper side thereof with twin grooves 
which receive displaceable front covering parts. The 
front parts are guided in corresponding grooves provided 
in the underside of the upper shelf. The lower shelf is 
thus comprised of a relatively large number of different 
parts, and the front parts, the rail and the intermediate 
shelf parts are supported solely by said inner shelf 
part, resulting in complicated fitting and installation 
procedures and also in the inducement of considerable 
stresses in the inner shelf part. The object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel and advantageous cable duct or trunk construction 
with which the aforesaid drawbacks are at least essentially 
avoided. To this end, it is suggested that a cable duct is constructed 
in accordance with the characterizing features 
set forth in Claim 1. This inventive arrangement provides 
a cable duct which can be manufactured and installed 
simply and economically, and a cable duct which 
has an aesthetic appearance and which can be readily  
 
supplemented after manufacture with further electric 
sockets or corresponding electrical outlets when so required. 
Together with the spacing members, the snap-over 
front parts embracing the shelves provide a rigid construction 
in which any stresses that might occur are 
favourably distributed between the two shelves. Other characteristic features of the invention and 
advantages afforded thereby will be apparent from the 
depending Claims and from the following description of 
an exemplifying embodiment of the invention illustrated 
in the accompanying drawings, in which 
Figure 1is a perspective view of an inventive cable 
duct; Figure 2is a cross-sectional view of the duct shown in 
Figure 1; Figure 3is a side view of a spacing member, seen from 
the right in Figure 2; and Figure 4illustrates a starting blank from which the 
distance member shown in Figures 2 and 3 is 
produced. The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cable duct for horizontally drawn cables (13) for 
connection to electrical, telephone, computer apparatus, 

etc., in the form of an elongated box-profile comprising 
a base part (4) which is intended to be mounted preferably 

at windowback height in relation to and at least 
essentially parallel with a wall, shelves (5, 6) which 

project out from mutually opposite, longitudinally 
extending edges of the base part, of which shelves the 

lowermost shelf (6) in the assembled state of the cable 
duct is provided with cable throughlets (10) for cables 

(11) which pass between electric sockets or outlets (12) 
concealed within the duct to equipment, such as light 

fittings, telephones, computers, etc., connected to said 
sockets or outlets, and which duct further comprises a 

front covering (2, 3) which extends along the length of 
the duct between the shelf edges remote from the base 

part and which permits access to the duct interior, 
wherein the front covering is divided along the length 

of the duct into two or more front parts of which at 
least one front part (3) can be moved along the duct and 

along at least one neighbouring front part (2),
characterized
 in that the movable front 
part (3) is movably mounted in at least one neighbouring 

front part (2) which, in turn, can be snapped resiliently 
into fittings (9) which are formed in the shelves (5, 

6) adjacent the longitudinally extending outer edges 
thereof remote from the base part (4); in that the snap-in 

front part (2) has flanges (16) which project out 
from a covering panel (15) and which are intended to 

engage longitudinally extending grooves (9) in the 
shelves (5, 6) and which have inwardly angled outer end-parts 

(17) which resiliently engage said grooves (9); 
and in that removably insertable buckling-resistant 

spacer members (26) are fitted in the interspace between  
 

the shelves (5, 6). 
A cable duct according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the height or extension 

of the flanges (16) is greater than the distance between 
grooves (9) and the longitudinally extending outer edges 

of the shelves (5, 6) so as to form an interspace between the 
cover panel (15) and said outer edges, wherein the 

movable front part (3) fits into and is accommodated by 
said interspace. 
A cable duct according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
by electrical socket holders (22) 

capable of being snapped resiliently into fittings, 
preferably fittings in the form of grooves (7, 8) which 

extend longitudinally along the mutually facing sides of 
the shelves (5, 6). 
A cable duct according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the socket holders (22) have the 

form of a generally L-shaped, resilient profiled member 
comprising a staple (23) whose length slightly exceeds 

the distance between the mutually opposing sides of the 
shelves, and a base (24) which is angled from one end-part 

of the staple: in that the opposite end-part of the 
staple is intended to be received in a longitudinally 

extending groove (7) provided in the inside of one shelf 
(5), whereas the base (24) is intended to abut the inner 

surface of the other shelf (6) and has a part (25) which 
is angled in a direction opposite to the direction of 

the staple (23) and which is received in a longitudinally 
extending groove (8) provided in the inner surface 

of the other shelf (6). 
A cable duct according to any one of Claims 1-4, 

characterized
 in that the spacing members  
 

(26) are intended to be received in mutually opposite 
grooves (8) in the mutually facing sides of the shelves.
