<ABSTRACT>
A phonic book includes a speaking device mounted to a 
book. The speaking device has a phonetic integrated circuit 

chip which has memory built therein to store in each segment 
thereof the content of a page of the book. A page number 

code is attached to each page of the book to be contactingly 
engageable by a page number identifying arm in electrical 

connection with the phonetic integrated circuit via a number 
of address lines to provide an address signal associated 

with the page number to the phonetic integrated circuit 
chip. This allows the phonetic integrated circuit chip to 

access a specific memory segment associated with the page 
number, to read the content of the memory segment and to 

broadcast the content by a speaker.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a phonic 
book with sound speaking device for automatically reading 
out the contents of the book and a page number identifying 
device for selecting specific page to be read out. Currently, the commercially available phonic books 
include a separate recording medium, such as a cassette 
tape, for recording the contents of the books therein in 
advance to allow a reader to play back in reading the books. 
Such a conventional manner to provide audio signals of the 
contents of the books is inconvenient in that in general, 
the reader has no way to selectively read a specific section 
or page of the book directly for it is difficult for the 
reader to locate that section or page in the cassette tape 
by using a regular tape player. It is therefore desirable to provide an phonic book 
which has a page number identifying device incorporated 
therein to selectively read out specific pages of a book by 
a speaking device. It is therefore the principal objective of the present 
invention to provide a phonic book which has a page  
 
identifying device incorporated therein to allow a reader to 
identify the portion of the content of the book stored in 
storing device to be read out. It is also an objective of the present invention to 
provide a phonic book which has a page identifying device to 
allow the reader, particularly young children, to listen to 
the content of a selected page of the book. It is also an objective of the present invention to 
provide a phonic book which has a page identifying device to 
allow the blind to touch and listen to the content of a 
specific page of a braille book. To achieve the above objectives, there is provided a 
phonic book comprising a speaking device mounted to a book. 
The speaking device has a phonetic integrated circuit chip 
which has memory built therein to store in each segment 
thereof the content of a page of the book. A page number 
code is attached to each page of the book to be contactingly 
engageable by a page number identifying arm in electrical 
connection with the phonetic integrated circuit via a number 
of address lines to provide an address signal associated 
with the page number to the phonetic integrated circuit 
chip. This allows the phonetic integrated circuit chip to 
access a specific memory segment associated with the page 
number, to read the content of the memory segment and to 
broadcast the content by a speaker. Apparently, the present invention provides the 
following advantages:  (1) The phonic
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A phonic book comprising a book having a number of 
pages to each of which a page number code representing 

the page number thereof is attached and speaking means 
which comprises a phonetic integrated circuit chip 

having memory means built therein, said memory means 
having a number of segments each storing the content of 

one of the pages of said book therein and identified by 
an address, a
 power source for supplying power to said 
phonetic integrated circuit chip, a speaker in 

electrical connection with said phonetic integrated 
circuit chip for converting electrical signals sent out 

by said chip into audio signals with the power supplied 
by said power source and a page number identifying arm 

which is in electrical connection with said phonetic 
integrated circuit chip and contactingly engageable 

with the page number code to provide an address signal 
to said chip in response to the page number code 

engaged thereby to allow said chip to read the memory 
segment associated with the page number and to apply 

electrical signal associated with the content stored in 
the memory segment to said speaker. 
A phonic book as claimed in Claim 1, wherein an 
amplifying circuit is connected between said phonetic 

integrated circuit chip and said speaker. 
A phonic book as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said page 
number codes are made of an electrical conductive 

material, wherein each of said page number codes 
comprises a first strip and at least a second strip in 

parallel with and in electrical connection with said 
first strip, said at least one second strip being 

disposed at different locations with respect to said 
first strip and having a different quantity for each 

different page of said book to indicate the different 
page number of said book, and wherein said page number 

arm comprises a third and at least a fourth 
electrically conductive strips with said third strip 

associated with said first strip and said at least one 
fourth strip in correspondence with said at least one 

second strip of said page number code so that when said 
page number identifying arm contacts said page number 

code, electrical power is applied to said first strip 
from said third strip and back to said fourth strips 

through a combination of said second strips to form the 
address signal associated with the page number code for 

providing to said phonetic integrated circuit chip. 
A phonic book as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said page 
number identifying arm is movable relative to said page 

number code formed on each page of said book to allow 
turning of the pages.
