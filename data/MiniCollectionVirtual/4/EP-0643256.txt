<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates especially to a casing for a motor vehicle lighting or signalling device, of the type closed by a cover lens and enclosing at least one bulb and one reflector, the wall (13) of which casing adopts, in the region of an access opening (10), a substantially cylindrical shape, and which casing has a cover (2) for closing this opening (10). According to the invention, the cover (2) is formed by a semi-rigid material and it comprises at least one annular skirt (21, 22; 31, 32) directed axially, which can be positioned against the said wall (13) over an axially directed peripheral contact surface, the skirt (21, 22; 31, 32) having, over its entire circumferential extent, at least one lateral groove (221; 313), while the wall (13) comprises at least one boss (14) of complementary shape.

A casing for a motor vehicle lighting or indicator
unit, of the type closed by a cover glass and

containing within it at least one lamp and a reflector
and having a wall (13), which has a substantially

cylindrical form in the region of an access aperture
(10) and which carries a cap (2) for covering the said

aperture (10), the said cap having at least one annular
skirt portion (21, 22; 31, 32) directed axially,

adapted to adopt a position against the said wall (13)
by virtue of an axially directed peripheral contact

surface, and the skirt portion (21, 22; 31, 32)
having, over its whole circumferential extent, at least

one lateral recess (221; 313), while the wall (13)
includes at least one element (14) of complementary

form, characterised in that the cap (2) is made of a
semi-rigid plastics material, and in that the element

(14) of the wall (13) consists of a bead projecting
radially from the wall.
A casing according to Claim 1, characterised in
that the s
aid recess is in the form of a groove (221;
313), while the bead consists of a peripheral rib (14),

discontinuous or otherwise, the groove and the bead
each having a rounded profile.
A casing according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, which has
an inner skirt portion (22) and an outer skirt portion

(21), characterised in that the said recess (221) is
defined within the inner skirt portion (22). 
A casing according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 which
includes an inner skirt portion (22) and an outer skirt

portion (21), characterised in that the recess (221) is
defined within the outer skirt portion (21).
A casing according to Claim 3 or Claim 4,
characterised in that the outer wall of the inner skirt

portion (22) is chamfered.
A casing according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterised in that the recess (313) is bounded by a

so-called sealing zone (311) which consists of a
peripheral protrusion constituting a hard point during

introduction of the cap on the casing, and which is
extended by a terminal zone (312) of frusto-conical

cross section which is adapted to obtain "all or
nothing" closing.
In a motor vehicle lighting or indicator unit, a
closure cap adapted to be mounted on the access

aperture (10) of a casing bounded by a predetermined
wall (13), which extends substantially axially and has

a predetermined lateral bead (14) in the region of its
free end, the cap being of the type which includes at

least one annular skirt portion (21, 22; 31, 32)
extending substantially axially from a base wall (20;

300) and adapted to come into position in a
substantially complementary manner against the said

wall (13) of the casing, and being characterised in
that it is formed of a semi-rigid plastics material and

in that the said skirt portion (21, 22; 31, 32) has,
adjacent to the said base wall and over its

circumferential extent, at least one lateral recess
(221; 313) adapted to receive the said bead, the said

recess being open radially on the outside and being 
bounded, on the same side as the said base wall,

directly by an outward extension of the base wall.
A cap according to Claim 7, characterised in that
the recess (313) is bounded by a so-called sealing zone

(311) which consists of a peripheral protrusion
constituting a hard point during introduction of the

cap on the casing, and which is extended by a terminal
zone (312) of frusto-conical cross section which is

adapted to obtain "all or nothing" closing.
A motor vehicle headlight having a casing according
to one of Claims 1 to 6.
