<ABSTRACT>
A multi-piece sanding wheel (5) having two sanding members (7) mounted about peripheral portions of a disc-shaped support member (9) secured to a drive means (11). Each sanding member (7) includes a C-shaped backing portion (23) with a sanding strip (25) removably secured about its outer periphery. The sanding strip (25) also has two end sections (47) which are secured over ends (43) of the C-shape. The C-shaped backing portions (23) are attached to the disc-shaped support member (9) with ends (45) of the two C-shapes substantially adjacent to one another and pinching the end sections (47) of the sanding strips (25) therebetween. The disc-shaped support member (9) is separately and removably attached to the drive means (11) wherein the sanding members (7) can be removed from the support member (9) without having to disconnect the support (9) member from the drive means (11). In this manner, the sanding strips (25) and backing portions (23) can both be easily and quickly removed and replaced.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field Of The Invention - This invention
relates to the field of
multi-piece sanding
wheels.2. Discussion Of The Background - Sanding
wheels are widely used in a number of industrial
applications to finish wood and other materials. In
a typical operating setup, the sanding wheel is
mounted on a drive motor and rotated about an axis as
the piece to be worked is moved by it. The sanding
wheel itself may be of any number of designs including
single and multi-piece ones. In single piece designs,
the sanding element and its backing portion are simply
combined into an integral unit. In multi-piece
designs, a common approach is to have a sanding member
which includes a sanding strip and a contoured or
profiled backing portion wherein the strip is
positioned about the periphery of the backing portion.
The planar or flat strip then assumes the profile of
its backing portion. Alternately, the sanding strip 
itself can be contoured and mounted about a non-profiled
backing portion.In high volume operations, it is critical that
the design of the sanding wheel not only permit its
sanding element (e.g., a strip of sandpaper) to be
easily and quickly removed and replaced once it is
worn but also permit the backing portion or portions
to be quickly and easily removed and replaced. That
is, in large volume operations, downtime to replace
worn sanding elements or to replace one profiled
backing portion with another is absolutely crucial to
a successful and efficiently run shop. In this regard
and if the sanding station is simply one in a line of
operations, then essentially the entire assembly or
processing line must be shut down while the changes
are made to the sanding wheels. Current sanding
wheels do not permit quick changeouts and in
particular, do not permit a quick change of a worn
sanding element on a wheel or a quick change of one
profiled backing portion for another.For example, with the design of U.S. Patent No.
4,870,787 to Voorhees which uses a continuous sanding
strip, the strip can only be changed by loosening the
entire wheel from its drive, separating the top and
bottom halves of the wheel, inserting the sanding
strip between the halves, and then re-tightening the
halves together and onto the drive. The downtime to
do such a change is obviously quite substantial
particularly since the entire sanding wheel must be
removed from its drive each time the sanding strip is
changed or a new profile is needed.In a companion U.S. Patent No. 4,744,180,
Voorhees discloses a sanding wheel in which his
