<ABSTRACT>
A string for sports application, in particular for tennis, badminton, racquetball and squash racquets or the like comprises a center core and at least one ribbon-like wrap made of a highly abrasion resistant material which exhibits a higher melting point and at least one of a higher dynamic stiffness and a lower static stiffness than the core material. A preferred wrap material meeting the above criteria is poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide). The wrap should cover at least 25 %, and preferably at least 50 % of the center core's outer surface to reduce notching. Due to the reduced notching, superior combined properties of durability, playability and minimal loss of string tension are achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a synthetic string for
sporting applications such as tennis, badminton,
racquetball and squash racquets or the like.Racquet strings generally come in a variety of
nominal diameter sizes (gauge) and are tensioned between 4.5
and 38.5 kgs (10 to 85 pounds), the string gauge and the tension
depending upon the size of the racquet, the style of play
and preference of the player. Conventional racquets are
basically strung with either two-piece strings or one
piece string, the latter being preferable since only two
knots rather than four knots are required to tie the ends
of the string. Conventional racquet strings have two
string components, main-strings running generally
parallel to the length-wise direction of the racquet and
cross-strings running perpendicularly to the main-strings.
In stringing a conventional stringing pattern,
usually all of the main strings are positioned and
tensioned first and then each cross-string is woven
through the main string and tensioned. The cross-strings
in general are interwoven alternately with the main-strings
to form an interwoven mesh-like pattern.The performance of a string is categorized in
several ways. The three most important performance
categories are playability, durability and tension loss.
In prior strings, there was always a tradeoff between a
highly playable string which sacrificed durability and a
highly durable string which sacrificed playability. One
example of a highly playable string which sacrifices
durability is a natural gut string from sheep, cow, 
whale, and others. A natural gut string plays well
because it is highly elastic (low in static stiffness)
and highly resilient (low in dynamic stiffness).
Elasticity is defined as the ability of a material to
return to its original dimensions after the removal of
stresses. Resilience is defined as the potential energy
stored up in a deformed body. A natural gut string,
however, is very sensitive to humidity, causing the
string to either break or lose tension sooner and is
highly susceptible to fraying (peeling) from abrasion,
particularly at the string crossover locations, wearing
the string rapidly.An example of a highly durable string, but with less
than average playability is a synthetic string which
incorporates a highly abrasion resistant fiber such as
para-aramids (KEVLAR, TECHNORA, TWARON), melt spun liquid
crystal polymers (VECTRAN) and high molecular weight
polyethylene (SPECTRA). These materials are highly
abrasion resistant. However, they are also extremely
stiff and
