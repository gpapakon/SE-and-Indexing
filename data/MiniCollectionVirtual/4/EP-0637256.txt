<ABSTRACT>
A parenteral device (10) comprising a body (12) having a forward end (26) and a rearward end (34). The forward end (26) is capable of receiving a hollow retractable needle (20) therein so as to project therefrom. The retractable needle (20) is slidable relative to the body (12) and the body (12) also includes a chamber (14) capable of receiving parenteral fluid and capable of being reduced in volume to expel fluid contained therein. The needle (20) is capable of being manually retracted within the body (12) such that the chamber (14) reduces in volume to expel fluid contained therein and such that the needle (20) is retracted to be wholly contained within the body (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to an improved parenteral device.Throughout this specification the term "parenteral device"
shall be taken to include any device which can be used for
the conveyance of parenteral fluids which are to be
introduced into or drawn from the body through the skin and
shall include within its scope a syringe, a cannula, a
hypodermic needle, an intravenous infusion line, and like
devices.A primary characteristic of parenteral devices is the
provision of a sharp hollow needle to facilitate the
transfer of fluids to or from the body. The difficulty
created by the presence of such a needle arises from the
possibility of injury which may be caused to a user or to
medical staff when using the device, or indeed to any
person who may be required to handle the device before or
after use.Of course, the injury itself does not represent the major
concern, the major concern arising from the dangers of
infection from such injuries due to the presence of
pathogens which may be present on the needle as a result of
its use. Indeed, it has been proven that a number of viral
infections, notably the HIV virus and hepatitis B, can be
transmitted by the reuse of needles previously used to
inject an infected individual.These dangers have resulted in the development of very
careful and sometimes detailed disposal procedures being
adopted in institutions where such parenteral devices are
used. It has also resulted in attempts being made at
developing single use parenteral devices that are not
capable of being reused. However, the disposal procedures adopted by such
institutions are not able to be enforced in out-of-clinic
situations, such as those situations where individuals
inject recreational drugs. Further, the users of
recreational drugs are often capable of quite easily
manipulating a so called "one use" syringe to be able to
continue using that same syringe.It is an object of the present invention to provide
an improved parenteral device wherein operation of the
device in performing an injection alters the
configuration of the device such that the device becomes
extremely difficult to refill and also to reuse. A
further object is to provide a parenteral device having a
needle that retracts so as not to be exposed after use.US-A-4676781 discloses an injector for delivering a
predetermined dose into an animal.EP-A-0326983 discloses a parenteral device with
slidable retractable needle.The present invention provides a parenteral device
comprising a body having a forward end and a rearward
end, the forward

<CLAIMS>
A parenteral device (10) comprising a body (12)
having a forward end and a rearward end, the forward end

supporting a hollow needle (20) so as to project from the
forward end, the retractable needle being mounted in a

plug (16) to be slidable relative to the body, the body
also including a chamber (14) capable of receiving

parenteral fluid, wherein the needle projects through the
plug to provide communication between the chamber and the

hollow interior of the needle, 
characterised by
: the plug
(16) being sealingly supported in the body (12), the

chamber (14) being formed between the plug and a stopping
means (18), a retraction means (28) located rearwardly of

the stopping means (18) being connected to the plug for
moving the plug rearwardly towards to the stopping means

(18), to retract the needle (20) within the body while
expelling fluid contained in the chamber, wherein the

needle can be retracted to be wholly contained within the
body.
A parenteral device (10) according to claim 1,
wherein the stopping means (18) defines the rear extent

of the initial movement of the plug (16) and also
defines the rear end of the chamber (14).
A parenteral device (10) according to claim 1,
wherein the stopping means (18) is slidable relative to

the body and is in sealing engagement with the internal
walls of the body.
A parenteral device (10) according to claim 3,
wherein a greater force is required to move the stopping

means (18) than to move the plug (16) and thus expel the
fluid. 
A parenteral device (10) according to claim 4,
wherein the retracting means is a flexible line (28)

located internally of the body (12) of the parenteral
device, secured to the rear surface of the plug (16) and

passing through the stopping means (18).
A parenteral device (10) according to claim 5,
wherein the line (28) passes through the stopping means

(18) via a sealable aperture such that the plug (16) may
be pulled through the stopping means to urge the plug

rearwardly and initiate retraction of the needle (20).
A parenteral device (10) according to any one of
claims 1 to 6, wherein a resilient device is located

within a space defined forwardly of the plug (16), the
resilient device being able to contract to fill the

chamber (14) and thus able to expand under its normal
bias to reduce the volume of the chamber and expel the

fluid.
A parenteral device (10) according to any one of
claims 1 to 6, wherein a resilient device is located

within a space defined rearwardly of the plug (16), the
resilient device being configured so as to expand to fill

the chamber (14) with parenteral fluid and so as to then
be capable of contracting under its normal bias to reduce

the volume of the chamber and expel the fluid.
A parenteral device (10) according to claim 7 or
claim 8, wherein a trigger mechanism is provided to hold

the resilient device in its contracted position and to
allow the release and subsequent expansion of the

resilient device.
A parenteral device (10) according to any one of
claims 7 to 9, wherein the resilient device is a spring. 
A parenteral device (10) according to claim 1,
wherein the body includes an increased diameter portion

at or towards the rearward end thereof, said increased
diameter portion being capable of loosely receiving the

stopping means (18) or the stopping means and the plug
(16).
A parenteral device (10) according to claim 11,
wherein the increased diameter portion is defined by a

sudden increase in diameter so as to provide a shoulder.
A parenteral device (10) according to claim 11,
wherein the increased diameter portion is defined by a

smooth increase in diameter to provide a gradual taper
increasing in diameter towards the rear of the body.
