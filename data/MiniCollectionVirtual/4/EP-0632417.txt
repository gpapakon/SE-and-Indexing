<ABSTRACT>
A drive circuit (26) for use with an ambient 
condition detector (16) limits heat dissipation and 

associated temperature rises in the presence of varying RMS 
values of an applied AC signal. The drive circuit (26) 

includes a voltage doubler with a current regulator (36) 
located between first and second storage elements (32, 34). 

In the presence of a sensed ambient condition, which 
exceeds a predetermined threshold the regulator 36 is 

enabled permitting one of the storage elements (34) to be 
charged to a voltage on the order of twice the peak value 

of the applied AC voltage. A digital timer (40) is used to 
trigger a flashable visual indicator (30) from the stored 

DC voltage. The regulator (36) provides a substantially 
constant DC voltage to the visual indicator (30) in the 

presence of a varying AC line voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to smoke or gas
detectors usable to provide an alarm when a selected
condition exceeds a predetermined threshold. More
particularly, the invention pertains to such detectors
which produce as an alarm indicium a high intensity
light.There has been of late interest in smoke or
gas detectors which provide visual alarm indicators as
well as audible alarm indications. For example, it has
been recognized that hearing impaired individuals may
not hear a normal fire or smoke alarm. This is
especially the case when such individuals are sleeping.It has been known to couple high intensity
strobe lights to smoke detectors so as to provide a
visual output. Known circuits for driving such strobe
lights, such as xenon tubes, have suffered from both
variations in flash rate and also unwanted heat
dissipation in response to variations in applied AC
electrical energy.It would be desirable to be able to limit the
extent of heat dissipated in such circuits, along with
associated temperature increases, in spite of increases
in applied AC line voltage. Additionally, it would be
desirable to maintain a constant flashing rate in the
presence of variable applied AC voltage and also to
provide a uniform degree of illumination from the strobe
light notwithstanding such voltage variations. US-A-4 283 657 discloses an exit illuminating system
for illuminating an exit or exit sign with high intensity
light under emergency conditions. The system incorporates an
emergency condition detector which develops an activating
signal which energizes a high intensity xenon flash lamp. The
flash lamp is powered by a battery if line power is lost. In
the driver circuit of the US-A-4 283 657, the battery current
is converted into high voltage direct current. This high
voltage direct current is provided to an energy storage element
which discharges periodically into the xenon discharge
lamp under control of a lamp trigger circuit which senses
when the energy stored in the storage element has attained a
level sufficient to illuminate the xenon discharge lamp.The relevant features known from this prior art document
US-A-4 283 657 are mentioned in the preamble of attached
claim 1.From ELEKTRO, Vol. 10, No. 7/8, August 1984, Canterbury,
GB, page 776, a voltage doubler circuit connected to an
AC source for firing a xenon flash tube is known.According to the present invention as described in
the attached claims, a drive circuit usable to drive a strobe
light includes a voltage doubler having first and second energy
storage
