<ABSTRACT>
A heel jaw for a safety ski binding, having a housing (1) on which there is pivotably mounted a sole holder on which there acts at least one triggering spring (4), which can be pre-set via a setting screw (7), and having a base plate which is fixed to the ski and on which the housing (1) is guided in a longitudinally displaceable manner, and can be fastened by means of a latching device, spindle (13) or the like which can be supported on the housing. Furthermore, an essentially horizontally arranged thrust-action spring (12) is provided in the housing (1), which spring is mounted, by means of one end, on the latching device (13) and, by means of the other end, on a two-armed cam lever (19) which is arranged horizontally in the housing, is mounted such that it can be pivoted about an essentially vertical axis on the housing (1), is connected via one of its arms (23), by means of a connecting piece (20) arranged in the region of a side wall of the housing (1), to the setting screw (7) of the triggering spring (4), and engages on the thrust-action spring (12) by means of its second arm (22), which is designed as a cam.

A heel holder for a safety ski binding, comprising a 
housing (1) with a sole holder hinged thereon and subjected 

to the action of at least one release spring (4) selectively 
adjustable by means of an adjustment spring (7), and a base 

plate fixedly mounted on a ski and having said housing (1) 
mounted thereon for longitudinal displacement, the longitudinal 

position of said housing (1) relative to said base 
plate being adjustable by means of a detent, a spindle 

(13) or the like adapted to take support on said housing, a 
thrust spring (12) disposed in said housing (1) in a substantially 

horizontal position having one of its end supported 
on said detent, spindle (13) or the like, and its 

other end, on a two-armed cam lever (19) rotatably mounted 
in said housing with one (23) of its arms connected to said 

adjustment screw (7) of said release spring (4) through a 
connecting link (20) and its other arm (22) acting as a cam 

member in engagement with said thrust spring (12), 
characterized in that said cam lever (19) is horizontally 

disposed and mounted on said housing (1) for pivoting about 
a substantially vertical axis, and that said connecting link 

(20) is disposed adjacent a sidewall of said housing (1). 
A heel holder according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said cam lever (19) is integrally formed on both sides 

thereof with respective axle pins (21a,21b) mounted in bushings 
formed in said housing above one another. 
A heel holder according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that said laterally disposed connecting link (20) in said 

housing (1) is of angular configuration, with a first arm 
(24) extending substantially horizontal and a second arm 

(26) extending substantially vertical. 
A heel holder according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said horizontally extending first arm (24) of said  

 
connecting link (20) is guided in a slot formed between a 

lateral housing wall and a partition provided laterally of 
said thrust spring (12). 
A heel holder according to claim 3, characterized in 
that said vertically extending second arm (26) of said 

connecting link (20) is guided in a slot (27) provided in 
the housing wall. 
A heel holder according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the front end of said slot (27) acts as a stop (30) to 

be engaged by said vertically extending arm (26) of said 
connecting link when said release spring (4) is adjusted to 

its maximum permissible bias by means of said adjustment 
screw (7), at the same time setting said thrust spring (12) 

to its maximum bias. 
A heel holder according to any of claims 3 to 6, characterized 
in that said horizontally extending first arm (24) 

of said connecting link (20) has its end formed as a fork 
(25a,25b), with the free end of said first arm (23) of said 

cam lever being received between the two prongs of the fork. 
A heel holder according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that said connecting link (20) is connected to 

said adjustment screw (7) through an insert member (5) on 
which said release spring (4) takes support and which has 

provided thereon an indicator (10) for indicating the bias 
to which said release spring (4) is adjusted. 
A heel holder according to claim 8, characterized in 
that said connecting link (20) is provided with a horizontal 

projection (28) received in a recess (29) of said insert 
member (5) provided therein adjacent the housing wall.
