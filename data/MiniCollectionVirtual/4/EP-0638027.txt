<DESCRIPTION>
 ONE-PIECE UPPER TRACK FOR A POWER SEAT ADJUSTERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention: The present invention relates, in general, to seats, and, more specifically, to power seat adjusters for automobile seats.Powered seat adjusters are a popular option on many automotive vehicles and are frequently offered as standard equipment on higher priced vehicles. Such power seat adjusters are primarily used on the driver's seat and, sometimes, on the front passenger seat of the vehicle.Such power seat adjusters carry an upper support frame which supports the seat bottom and sometimes the seat back of the vehicle seat. The upper support frame is mounted on first and second, spaced track assemblies, each formed of an upper track which is connected to the upper support frame and which is slidably mounted in a lower track anchored to the vehicle floor. A drive mechanism, typically formed of a bi-directional electric motor, is mounted on the power seat adjuster and rotates a pair of drive shafts extending outward from the motor to a gear assembly or box mounted in each upper track. In one arrangement, the gear box rotates a lead screw extending below each upper track. A drive block mounted to the lower track threadingly receives the lead screw to cause reciprocal movement of the upper track and the attached upper support frame upon selective energization of the drive motor. Other drive mechanisms may also be incorporated into the power seat adjuster to provide vertical movement of the seat frame as well as pivotal movement of the seat back with respect to the seat bottom.Although such power seat adjusters provide easy fore and aft movement of the seat in the lower tracks, it is imperative that the seat remain in a fixed, stationary position during a collision in order to prevent injury to the vehicle passenger using the seat. As a result, the weight and size of the power seat adjuster components are selected to provide a 

maximum amount of strength to resist any movement under the high impact forces transmitted to the seat from occupant and seat weight inertial loads and, sometimes, through the seat belt during a vehicle collision. Thus, the individual tracks, the torsion tubes or bars typically extending between and interconnecting the spaced upper tracks into a rigid structure and the other components of the power seat adjuster are made with stronger materials and greater thicknesses and dimensions to provide the requisite amount of strength. Although this adds weight and cost to the seat, such efforts

<CLAIMS>
What is Claimed is:
1 1. An upper track for a power seat adjuster having
2 first and second spaced track assemblies, each including an upper
3 track reciprocatingly movable within a lower track by a drive
4 means and at least one tubular member extending between and
5 joined to the upper tracks of each of the first and second track
6 assemblies, the upper track comprising:
7 a one-piece elongated member;
8 the one-piece member having longitudinal side walls
9 slidably mounted within a lower track;
10 at least one pair of spaced first and second flanges
11 integrally formed as a part of the one-piece member and extending
12 outward from the one-piece member; and
13 coaxial apertures formed in the first and second
14 flanges for receiving and connecting a tubular member extending
15 between the first and second track assemblies to the one-piece
16 member.
1 2. The upper track of Claim 1 further comprising:
2 another pair of spaced first and second flanges
3 integrally formed as a part of the one-piece member and spaced
4 from the one pair of first and second flanges, each of the first
5 and second flanges of the another pair of flanges having coaxial
6 apertures formed therein for connecting another tubular member
7 extending between the first and second track assemblies to the
8 one-piece member.
1 3. The upper track of Claim 1 further comprising:
2 each longitudinally extending side wall of the one- - 3 piece member having a channel-like configuration slidably
4 engageable with a matingly formed side wall channel on the lower
>
 5 track.
1 4. The upper track of Claim 3 further comprising:
2 a plastic sleeve fixedly mounted in each channel of 


each lower track and interposed between opposed surfaces of the upper track and the lower track.
5. The upper track of Claim 1 wherein the first and second flanges comprise: a stamped and bent portion of the one-piece member.
6. A track apparatus for a power seat adjuster for a vehicle having a floor, the track apparatus comprising: first and second spaced track assemblies, each first and second track assembly comprising: a lower track fixedly mounted on the vehicle floor, the lower track including opposed side walls, each formed in a channel-like configuration; a one-piece elongated upper track slidingly mounted in the lower track; the upper track having opposed side walls formed in a channel-like configuration matingly engageable with the side walls of the lower track; at least one pair of first and second flanges integrally formed as a part of the one-piece upper track and extending outward from the one-piece upper track; coaxial apertures formed in the first and second flanges; and a tubular member extending between and mounted in the aligned apertures of the first and second flanges of each of the upper tracks of the first and second track assemblies.
7. The track apparatus of Claim 6 further comprising: another pair of spaced first and second flanges integrally formed as a part of the one-piece upper track and spaced from the one pair of first and second flanges, each of the irst and second flanges of the another pair of first and second flanges having coaxial apertures formed therein; and 



 another tubular member extending between and mounted in the aligned apertures of the another pair of first and second flanges of each of the upper tracks of the first and second track assemblies.
8. The track apparatus of Claim 6 further comprising: a plastic sleeve fixedly mounted in each channel-like side wall of each lower track and interposed between opposed surfaces of the upper track and lower track.
9. The track apparatus of Claim 6 wherein the first and second flanges comprise: a stamped and bent portion of the one-piece upper track.
