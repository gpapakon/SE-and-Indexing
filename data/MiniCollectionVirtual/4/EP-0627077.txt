<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a sensor for the determination of gas concentrations, in particular CO, NOx and HC in the emissions from internal-combustion engines. The sensor includes a measurement probe (10) located in a diffusion channel (23). The diffusion channel (23) is exposed to the gas mixture which passes through an exhaust-gas inlet (24) and to a reference gas which passes through a reference-gas inlet (25), the partial pressure of oxygen in the reference gas being greater than that in the gas mixture. An oxygen gradient is established in the diffusion channel (23), and in the opposite direction a gradient for the gas component to be determined. The measurement probe (10) is located at a point, with respect to the pollutant gradient and the oxygen gradient, at which oxygen is in excess.
