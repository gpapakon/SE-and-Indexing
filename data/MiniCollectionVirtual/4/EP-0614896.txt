<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the 
general formula (I): 


wherein R¹ and R² are, independently, a hydrogen atom, a 
saturated or unsaturated aliphatic acyl having 2 to 25 carbon 

atoms or benzoyl group and R³ is a hydrogen atom or alkyl group,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel esculetin
derivatives and pharmaceutical compositions, more particularly
an agent for protecting cartilage, i.e., a chondroprotective
agent.There are various types of arthropathy, for example,
rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic fever, and osteoarthritis. Many
people particularly suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis, and these diseases are considered the major
types of arthropathy. There are congenital and secondary
osteoarthritis, and further primary osteoarthritis caused by
degeneration of the articular cartilage along with aging.
Patients suffering from primary osteoarthritis have recently
been increasing along with the increase in the population of the
aged.Although there are considerable differences of the causes
and conditions between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis,
the articular function becomes eventually obstructed by the
destruction of the cartilage in both of rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis.The first choice of medicines for treatment of rheumatic
diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic fever,
systemic lupus erythematosus, or osteoarthritis, are analgesic
and anti-inflammatory agents, for example, aspirin or
indomethacin. Further, gold compounds (for example, Shiosol),
immunomodulators, steroids, or D-penicillamine is used as the
medicine for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.The above conventional analgesic and anti-inflammatory
agents, however, were not effective against the destruction of
the articular cartilage, and in fact, sometimes exhibited
adverse effect in the experiments using chondrocytes. Further,
no function to suppress the destruction of articular cartilage
was found in the above medicines for treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis.It was known that esculetin and 4-methylesculetin exhibit
the function to reduce cholesterol level, strengthening the
veins, and anti-oxidation (Japanese Examined Patent Publication
No. 42-16626). Further, it was also known that diesters of 4-methylesculetin
with carboxylic acids having 6 to 25 carbon
atoms, particularly, diesters of caprylic, lauric or palmitic
acid exhibit an effective anti-inflammatory action in the
treatment of skin disease (FR 2276819). However, it was not
known that the above esculetin and esculetin derivatives exhibit
a function to suppress cartilage destruction.Jurd et al. in Phytochemistry, Vol.10, no.12, 1971,
pp.2971 to 2974 disclose esculetin, esculetin
6,7-diacetate and 4-methylesculetin. Regarding
pharmacological effects, however, only the effects
