<ABSTRACT>
The microcontroller system comprises of a 
programmable microprocessor (13), a plurality of memory 

units (NVM1-3)having a plurality of addressable memory 
registers. The memory units are in bus communication 

with the programmable microprocessor (13) and an 
application specific integrated circuit (15). The 

application specific integrated circuit includes a 
circuit for dividing the memory units into a plurality of 

addressable regions in response to programming of the 
programmable microprocessor (13). The microprocessor is 

programmed such that the initial address for each of the 
regions is assigned by the most significant addressable 

bits, and the uppermost address for the region being 
programmably defined by uppermost address for the region. 

The circuit includes an address register. The 
microprocessor can address each of the memory registers 

and write a respective uppermost address in the 
respective one of the registers. Each of the addresses 

corresponding to the uppermost addressable registers of 
the respective memory device. A comparator circuit is 

provided for comparing the least significant bits of an 
address generated by the microprocessor (13) to the least 

significant bits of the uppermost address, and generating 
an output signal only if the address generated by the 

microprocessor is less than the uppermost address.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an address decoding 
system for a microcontroller system and, more 
particularly, to an address decoding system particularly 
suited for postage metering applications. European applications of even date are filed 
concurrently herewith corresponding to the following US 
applications commonly assigned to Pitney Bowes Inc.: US 
Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,627, entitled

ACCESS PROTECTION CIRCUIT WITH ENCRYPTION KEY; US Patent 
Application Serial No. 08/163,811, entitled MEMORY 
MONITORING CIRCUIT FOR DETECTING UNAUTHORIZED MEMORY 
ACCESS; US Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,771, 
entitled MULTI-MEMORY ACCESS LIMITING CIRCUIT FOR A 
MULTI-MEMORY DEVICE; US Patent Application Serial No. 
08/163,790, entitled ADDRESS DECODER WITH MEMORY 
ALLOCATION FOR A MICRO-CONTROLLER SYSTEM; US Patent 
Application Serial No. 08/163,810, entitled INTERRUPT 
CONTROLLER FOR AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT; US Patent 
Application Serial No. 08/163,812, entitled ADDRESS 
DECODER WITH MEMORY WAIT STATE CIRCUIT; US Patent 
Application Serial No. 08/164,100, entitled PROGRAMMABLE 
CLOCK MODULE FOR POSTAGE METERING CONTROL SYSTEM; and US 
Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,629, entitled 
CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AN ELECTRONIC POSTAGE METER HAVING A 
PROGRAMMABLE APPLICATION SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUIT. 
The content of all these European applications are 
incorporated hereby by reference.  In postage metering machine applications, and like 
machine applications, a microcontroller system is 
employed to control both machine control functions and 
system functions. System functions, for example, in the 
postage metering area, refers to such function as funds 
accounting, external device interface and user interface 
functions. Machine control functions, for example, 
refers to such functions as motor control, print control 
and sensor controls. In electronic postage metering machine, and like 
devices, it is customary to develop a specific 
microcontroller system for each model postage meter model 
to accommodate the unique control requirements of each 
meter model. Conventionally, a microcontroller system, 
of the type customarily used in postage metering 
applications, is comprised of a programmable 
microprocessor in bus
