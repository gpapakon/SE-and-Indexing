<ABSTRACT>
A method for making a shaft seal for a shaft (7) led out from a housing (6), in particular the crankshaft held in the crankcase of a motor vehicle, having a seal holder (2), fabricated as a metallic casting (20), with a through-opening (21) for the shaft (7), a dynamic shaft sealing ring (1) of an elastomeric material, which is fitted into the through-opening (21) of the seal holder (2), and a static seal (10), of the same elastomeric material as the shaft sealing ring (1), which is separate from the shaft sealing ring and is arranged on the side of the seal holder (2) facing the housing (6), is distinguished in that the shaft sealing ring (1) and the static seal (10) separate from it are moulded from the same side onto the seal holder (2) in one operation.

Method for the manufacture of shaft seal for a shaft (7) extending out of a 
casing (6) and in particular of acrankshaft received in the crankcase of a 

motor vehicle, with a gasket receptacle (2) in the form of a metal die casting 
(20) with a passage opening (21) for the shaft (7), a dynamic shaft seal ring 

(1) made from an elastomer material, which is placed in the passage opening 
(21) of the gasket receptacle (2) and a static gasket (10) made from elastomer 

material which is separate from the shaft seal ring and which is located on 
the side of the gasket receptacle (2) facing the casing (6), characterized in 

that the shaft seal ring (1) and the static gasket (10) separate therefrom 
are moulded in one operation and from the same side onto the gasket receptacle 

(2) via two separate moulding points (11, 13). 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that by means of at least 
one runner point (11) the static gasket (10) is moulded to the gasket receptacle 

(2) and the shaft seal ring (1) is moulded thereto by means of a circular 
channel (130) with a central moulding point (13), the spot runner (11) and the 

central moulding point (13) being supplied by multiple cavity dies of a single 
injection moulding tool. 
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that onto the casing (6) are 
moulded elastomer fitting elements (14, 15, 16) linked with the static gasket 

(10) for adapting the gasket receptacle (2). 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that on the 
die casting (20) machining only takes place of a face (27), perpendicular to 

said side of the casting (20) and which faces an oil sump (8) and on the 

static gasket (10) are moulded portions (114, 116) sealing towards said face 
(27). 
Shaft sal for a shaft (7) moved out of a casing (6) and in particular the 
crankshaft received in the crankcase of a motor vehicle, with a gasket receptacle 

(2) in the form of a metal die casting (20) with a passage opening (21) 
for the shaft (7), a dynamic shaft seal ring (1) made from an elastomer 

material, which is placed in the passage opening (21) of the gasket receptacle 
(2) and a static gasket (10) made from elastomer material which is separate  

 
from the shaft seal ring and which is located on the side of the gasket 

receptacle (2) facing the casing (6 ), characterized in that the gasket receptacle 
(2) has a conical face (25) concentric to the rotation axis (A) of the 

shaft (7) for centring in a moulding tool for the joint moulding of the separate 
gaskets (1, 10) on the gasket receptacle (2), as well as at least one 

runner bore (23) in the die casting (10) for forming a spot runner (11) for 
a static gasket (10). 
Shaft seal according to claim 5, characterized in that elastomer fitting 
elements (14, 15, 16) are constructed linked with the static gasket (10). 
Shaft seal according to claim 6, characterized in that the elastomer 
fitting elements (14, 15) line fitting bores (24) in the casting (20) of the 

gasket receptacle (2) and into which fit the fitting pins (61) located on the 
casing (6). 
Shaft seal according to claim 6, characterized in that the elastomer fitting 
elements are constructed as nipples (16), which fit into fitting bores of 

the casing (20). 
Shaft seal according to one of the claims 5 to 8, characterized in that 
onto the die casting (20) is cast at least one pressing rib (28), which is 

plastically deformed on closing the moulding tool for the moulding of the 
gasket (110). 
Shaft seal according to one of the claims 5 to 9, characterized in that 
the static gasket (10) is located in a groove (261) on the first face (26) of 

the gasket receptacle (2) facing the casing (6) and that the latter has a 
second face (27) perpendicular to the first face (26) and which engages on an 

oil sump gasket (5) of an oil sump (8) and the groove is open towards it and 
that the static gasket (10) is provided in the vicinity of the second face (27) 

with a sealing edge (110), projecting over the first face (26) towards the 
casing (6) and which is dimensioned in such a way that when the gasket receptacle 

(2) is pressed onto the casing (6) the elastomer material is displaced 
over and beyond the second face (26) downwards against the oil sump gasket in 

the form of a bead (117).  
 
Shaft seal according to one of the claims 5 to 9, characterized in that 
the shaft seal ring (1) is fastened by means of at least one web (101, 102) 

to an inwardly directed radial flange (29) of the casting (20).
