<DESCRIPTION>
Acne and seborrhea are two general classes of skin 
diseases which are marked by an abnormal function (usually 
hyperactivity) of the sebaceous glands in the skin. The subject 
of this invention is the use of compounds to inhibit acne and 
seborrhea. Acne vulgaris is a disease of the pilosebaceous unit 
in the skin and is chronic and inflammatory in nature. It is 
characterized by comedos (blackheads), papules, pustules, cysts, 
and nodules. The areas of the body most commonly affected by 
the disease are those which have the most sebaceous glands, 
i.e., the face, neck, back, and chest. Acne is very common 
disease in both men and women and usually appears at the 
beginning of puberty. Although, the disease is usually mild and 
resolves itself by the time most people reach their mid-twenties, 
it can in many instances be disfiguring and a source 
of great physiological distress. In some extreme cases, acne 
can be the source of severe infection and even life-threatening. The etiology and pathogenesis of the disease begins 
with cohesive hyperkeratosis in which cornified cells adhere and 
block the follicular canal between the sebaceous gland and the 
surface of the skin. The sebaceous gland under hormonal control 
(testosterone and dihydrotestostrone) are stimulated to enlarge 
and produce increasing amounts sebaceous secretions (principally 
in the form of triacylglycerols). These sebaceous secretions 
are trapped in the blocked, follicular canal and build up to 
form a closed comedo. At this stage, common, indigenous skin 
bacteria (principally, Propionibacterum Acnes) begin to 
metabolize the triacylglycerols to free fatty acids. These 
liberated fatty acids are inflammatory and results in the 
formation of a papule. This papule is often raised and is 
typical of an inflammatory lesion, i.e., red, edematous, and 
painful. The papule may continue to expand and rupture the 
follicle wall, thus forming a pustule or cyst. The pustule 
stage is very painful and unsightly and is often a site for 
secondary infection by opportunistic bacteria such as  
 
Staphorius. The pustules and cysts often lead to the scarring 
and disfigurement seen in severe cases of acne. There are several drugs available for the treatment of 
acne. For mild cases, benzoyl peroxide is used and is often 
moderately effective. Benzoyl peroxide is thought to work by 
inhibiting cohesive hyperkeratosis and by suppressing P. Acnes. 
although benzoyl peroxide is effective in mild cases of acne, it 
suffers from several drawbacks: first,
