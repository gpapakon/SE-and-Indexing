<ABSTRACT>
A pipe (10) of polyethylene is reinforced by two layers (12, 14) of polyethylene tape wound around the pipe in opposite directions under tension. The pipe contains carbon black and the layers are unpigmented and free from fillers and are transparent to infra-red radiation to which the first major surface (21) is exposed. The radiation is in the near infra-red region and has a substantial part of the radiant energy of a wavelength of less than 2.5 micrometers. Very little radiation is absorbed by the layers but a very high absorption occurs in the outer surface of the pipe. This causes the interface between the second major surface (36) of the layer (12) and the first major surface (38) of the pipe and between the second major surface (28) of the layer (14) and the first major surface (30) of the layer (12) to reach temperatures at which fusion welding in the layers welds them together and welds the layer (12) and the pipe (10) together.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods of joining bodies of
thermoplastic material, in which the first body is a pipe.US-A-4 419 304 relates to the bonding of heat shrinkable sleeves
to plastic substrates and the effecting of an hermetic seal
therebetween. In an example, a heat shrinkable plastic sleeve
having a transmittance of at least 50% to electromagnetic
radiation within a selected wavelength band is loosely placed to
overlie a) a tubular neck portion of an end cap which terminates
a telecommunications cable and which is comprised of a high
density high molecular weight polyethylene, with the tubular neck
portion fitting closely about the cable, and b) the portion of
the cable emerging from the tubular neck of the end cap, the
cable having a low or medium density polyethylene and vinyl
acetate with carbon black additive. The cable, sleeve and end
cap are located in an infrared heater that emits infrared
radiation in a wavelength band of from 0.5 to 5.0 microns and the
heater is energised for a period of time sufficient for the
sleeve to shrink down upon the cable jacket and tubular neck
portion of the end cap and for their interfacing surfaces to fuse
together and result in the sleeve hermetically sealing about the
cable jacket and the tubular neck portion.British patent specification No. GB-A-1147477 discloses a method
of causing a heat-recoverable article to recover, the article
comprising a tubular sleeve of a material having the property 
of elastic memory and a fusible insert positioned within the
sleeve, which comprises irradiating the sleeve and the insert
with light energy, the material and the wavelength band of the
energy being such that the material absorbs a fraction of the
energy and transmits the remainder to the insert, the transmitted
energy being sufficient to raise the insert to its fusing
temperature and the fraction absorbed by the material being
sufficient to raise the material to its recovery temperature.The fusible insert is a solder insert composed of 63% tin and 37%
lead and the sleeve was cross-linked polymeric material having
elastic memory. On heating, the sleeve recovered and shrank and
firmly gripped the electrical connectors which the sleeve
encircled while the solder melted and flowed and formed a
soldered connection between the electrical conductors.The specification states that:-"... where the --- sleeve itself
is transparent to infra-red radiation, and absorber can 
be added to it, for example, carbon black... can be added to
polyethylene".The specification was not

A method of joining first and second bodies, of
thermoplastic material, in which the first body is a pipe

(10) and said second body is a layer (12) superimposed on
the first body, said layer having a first and a second

major external surface (30) (36) separated by the thickness
of the layer, said layer being superimposed so that second

major surface (36) of the layer is adjacent a major
external surface of the pipe (10), said method comprising

subjecting said first major surface (30) of said layer to
exposure to radiation in the near infra-red region of a

wavelength chosen so that the layer (12) is transparent to
said radiation and said pipe (10) at least at or adjacent

its said major surface (38) containing an absorber of said
radiation so that said two adjacent major surfaces (36)

(38) are caused to reach a temperature at which they are
joined by fusion welding, said two adjacent major surfaces

being held together.
A method according to claim 1 in which a third body being
a second layer (14) is superimposed on said first layer

(12), said second layer having a first and a second major
external surface (21) (28) separated by the thickness of

the second layer, said second layer (14) being superimposed
so that its second major external surface (28) is adjacent

said first major external surface (30) of said first layer 
(12), and heat from said major external surface (38) of

said pipe (10) being conducted through said first layer
which, when combined with heat produced by partial

absorption of the radiation in the layers, and by the
reflections at said major external surface (38) of said

pipe and at said first major external surface (30) of said
second body, causes said two adjacent major surfaces (30)

(28) of said layers (12) (14) to reach a temperature at
which they are joined by fusion welding, said two adjacent

major surfaces (30) (28) of said layers being held
together.
A method according to claim 2 in which said first layer
(12) is wound on said pipe (10) under tension and said

second layer (14) is wound on said first layer (12) under
tension, the direction in which said second layer is wound

being opposite to that in which said first layer is wound
so that said adjacent major surfaces (36) (38) of said

first layer and said pipe are held together and said
adjacent major surfaces (30) (28) of the layers are also

held together, said pipe having an internal major surface
(42) which is undistorted by heat by said fusion welding.
A method according to claim 3 in which each of said layers
(12) (14) is tape carrying a number of reinforcing fibres

extending lengthwise of the tape and being evenly spaced
across the tape, each said tape being progressively wound

at an angle to the length of the pipe (10).

each of said tapes (12), (14), carries a number of

reinforcing fibres extending lengthwise of the tape and

A method according to any preceding claim in which the
layer (12), or at least one of the layers (12), (14),

contains pigment or other absorber to adjust the
transparency to said infrared radiation of the layer, or

of one or more of the layers.
A method according to any preceding claim in which both
bodies (10) (12) , or all the bodies (10) (12) and (14) are

composed of polyethylene, the pipe (10) containing carbon
black as absorber and the radiation having a wavelength
