<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for the quantitative measurement of impurities in special gas at a level of 
ultra-high purity. After 

inert gas of ultra-high purity is supplied to a sample-gas pipe (14) through a purifier (1) (a first gas supply 
source), the inside of 

said sample-gas pipe (14) is baked by heating means (22 to 24). Then, the inside of the sample-gas pipe 
(14) is kept in an atmosphere 

at a specified temperature and a first and second changeover valves (9, 10; 16, 17) are changed over 
so that a fixed quantity 

of special gas is supplied into the sample-gas pipe (14). Afterward, the special gas remaining in the sample-gas 
pipe (14) is discharged 

and the 1st and 2nd changeover valves (9, 10; 16, 17) are changed over so that impurities may be 
desorbed by baking the 

inside of the sample-gas pipe, and quantities of desorbed impurities are measured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a measuring method for 
determining amounts of impurities contained in special gasses 
(silane gas, disilane gas, and the like) for use in, for example, 
semiconductor manufacturing, in the case in which such a special 
gas is supplied through a pipe system, and furthermore relates to 
a device for use in such measurement. Recently, the progress in the field of semiconductor 
manufacturing technology has been striking, and in particular, 
the demand for ultrafine structures and high levels of 
integration has become pressing; however, in conjunction with 
this, the necessity has arisen to maintain the environment of the 
manufacturing device in a state of ultrahigh purity (that is to 
say, purity on the level of parts per trillion). As a result, in 
the case in which sample gas of common gas (for example, argon 
gas, nitrogen gas, or the like) or special gas (for example, 
silane gas) having the necessary degree of ultrahigh purity for 
the manufacture of silicon substrates is supplied through a pipe 
system which serves as a gas flow path, it is necessary to 
determine the amount of impurities such as moisture and the like 
which are contained in the sample gas, on the level of parts per  
 
trillion. Measuring methods for determining the impurity adsorption 
amount in common gasses (argon gas, nitrogen gas, and the like), 
which were commonly employed, include the connection of a trace 
gas analyzer (atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer) 
to the pipe end of a sample pipe through which this common gas is 
caused to flow, and measuring the amount of impurities flowing 
out of the pipe end of this sample pipe. However, in the case in which such a special gas had 
corrosive or flammable characteristics, damage was done to the 
measurement system, or the handling of this gas presented 
difficulties, so that it was impossible to employ the measurement 
method which was used in the case of common gasses. Accordingly, 
in the case of such special gasses, there was no method for 
confirming the relationship between impurity amounts and gas flow 
amounts, and the like, so that, in other words, only a rough 
estimate could be made, and this was insufficient for the 
purposes of the manufacture of semiconductors having the 
ultrafine structures discussed above. The present invention solves the problems which were 
present in the conventional technology discussed above, and has 
as an object thereof to provide a device which is capable of 
conducting, easily, and on a
