<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulically actuated diaphragm pump has a diaphragm (1) which consists of at least two individual layers (1a, 1b). In the central zone of the diaphragm (1) a shape-retaining (inherently stable) stiffening element (25, 26; 42) is provided which is kept in contact with the diaphragm (1) and moves together with the diaphragm (1). The inlet and outlet ducts (14, 15) of the diaphragm pump in this arrangement debauch, at least for the greater part, radially within the stiffening element (25, 26; 42) into the discharge chamber, so that they are correspondingly covered by the stiffening element (25, 26; 42).

Hydraulically driven diaphragm pump with a diaphragm 
(1) which is clamped circumferentially between a pump 

element (2) and a pump lid (3) and comprises at least two 
individual layers (1a, 1b), separates a conveying chamber 

(4) comprising separate inlet and outlet ducts (14, 15) for 
a medium to be conveyed from a hydraulic chamber (5) and 

can be reciprocated between a suction stroke end position 
and a pressure stroke end position by a hydraulic diaphragm 

drive in the form of an oscillating displacement piston 
(6), an inherently stable reinforcing element (25, 26; 42) 

being provided in the central region of the diaphragm (1), 
being held in abutment against said diaphragm (1) and being 

displaceable together therewith, and the inlet and outlet 
ducts (14, 15) opening into the conveying chamber at least 

for the most part radially within the reinforcing element 
(25, 26; 42), so that they are correspondingly covered by 

the reinforcing element (25, 26; 42), characterised in 
that, on the sides facing the conveying and hydraulic 

chambers a pump lid and a pump element abutment surface 
(29, 41) respectively are provided, which cooperate with 

the reinforcing element (25, 26; 42) in a pressure stroke 
or suction stroke limiting position in order to 

mechanically limit the stroke of the diaphragm (1) on both 
sides, pump lid and pump element diaphragm bearing surfaces 

(11, 10) are provided, which in the pressure stroke or 
suction stroke limiting position together with the 

reinforcing element (25, 26; 42) form an at least 
substantially continuous diaphragm support surface, which 

matches the natural diaphragm geometry, and at the 
geodetically highest and/or lowest point of the pump lid 

(3) a bore (35 or 36) is provided, which is connected to 
the outlet or inlet duct (15 of 14).  

 
A diaphragm pump according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the reinforcing element (25, 26) rests against the 

outer surface of the diaphragm (1). 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the reinforcing element 

comprises a coupling member (25) on the side facing the 
conveying chamber and a coupling member (26) on the side 

facing the hydraulic chamber, between which coupling 
members the individual layers (1a, 1b) of the diaphragm (1) 

are clamped and thereby mechanically connected with one 
another. 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the coupling members (25, 26) 

are constructed as rotationally symmetrical support disks, 
more particularly with flat end faces. 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the reinforcing element (25, 

26) is at least partially enclosed by a plastics material 
layer (40). 
A diaphragm pump according to one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that the coupling member (25) on the side 

facing the conveying chamber comprises a rod-like securing 
element (32), which passes through central through 

apertures in the diaphragm (1) and in the coupling member 
(26) on the side facing the hydraulic chamber and is 

secured to a control pushrod (19) of a leakage compensating 
device controlled as a function of the diaphragm position. 
A diaphragm pump according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the rod-like securing element (32) of the coupling 

member (25) on the side facing the conveying chamber passes 
through a continuous longitudinal bore inside the control  

 
pushrod (19) and is secured to the end of the control 

pushrod facing the displacement piston (6). 
A diaphragm pump according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that the coupling member (26) on the side 

facing the hydraulic chamber is integrally formed with the 
control pushrod (19). 
A diaphragm pump according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the reinforcing element (42) is arranged between the 

individual layers (1a, 1b) of the diaphragm (1) and is 
preferably securely connected thereto, more particularly by 

bonding or welding. 
A diaphragm pump according to claim 9, characterised 
in that the reinforcing element (42) is formed by a 

rotationally symmetrical flat disk. 
A diaphragm pump according to claim 9 or 10, 
characterised in that the reinforcing element (42) is 

displaceable between its suction stroke and pressure stroke 
end positions at least partially independently of a support 

plate (26') on the side facing the hydraulic chamber. 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the radius of the reinforcing 

element (25, 26; 42) is equal to or greater than half the 
radius of the diaphragm section lying in the conveying 

chamber. 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the inlet and outlet ducts 

(14, 15) open into the conveying chamber (4) in such a 
manner that the distance between the centre point of the 

inlet and outlet ducts (14, 15) and the central axis (27) 
of the conveying chamber (4) measures at the most 50% of 

the maximum conveying chamber radius.  
 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that, in the region of their 

openings on the side facing the conveying chamber, the 
inlet and outlet ducts (14, 15) are aligned parallel to the 

direction of movement of the diaphragm (1). 
A diaphragm pump according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the individual diaphragm 

layers (1a, 1b) comprise a corrugation (21, 21') in the 
region between the reinforcing element (25, 26; 42) and the
