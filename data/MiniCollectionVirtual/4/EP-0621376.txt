<ABSTRACT>
A road-cleaning vehicle has a pivotably mounted sweepings container (4) which has a sweepings inlet (17) connected to a suction nozzle on the road surface and an outlet (21) for the suction air of a suction blower (15). As a result of the fact that the suction opening (16) of the suction blower (15) is mounted in the cover (6) of the sweepings container (4) turned away from the accumulated sweepings (18) and directed upwards, an improved separation of the swept material (13) from the air sucked in through a pipe (10) is achieved.

Road-cleaning machine comprising a suction blower (15), a suction nozzle (9) and a 
refuse container (4) having a refuse inlet (17) connected to the suction nozzle (9) 

and an outlet (21) for the suction air, the suction intake (16) of the suction blower 
(15) being mounted in the upper part of the refuse container (4) so that it is directed 

upwards, characterised in that the suction intake (16) of the suction blower (15) is 
mounted centrally with respect to length and width in the upper part of the refuse 

container (4). 
Road-cleaning machine according to claim 1, characterised in that a screen grid (19) 
for the refuse (13) is fitted in the upper part of the refuse container (4) in the region 

of a substantially larger cross section of the suction air stream than the suction 

intake (16) of the suction blower (15) and that is mounted below the suction blower (15) the motor 
(20) thereof so that it is directed towards the collected refuse (18). 
Road-cleaning machine according to claim 2, characterised in that the screen grid 
(19) for the refuse (13) is fitted above the suction intake (16) of the suction blower 

(15). 
Road-cleaning machine according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
air outlet (21) of the suction blower (15) is connected to a unit (27) including the 

suction nozzle (9) via an elbow (22) in turn having an air outlet (25) and a movable 
valve (23) by means of which a proportion of between approximately 0 % and 75 % 

of the exhaust air can be fed to tile unit (27) including the suction nozzle (9) in 
order to facilitate the uptake of refuse. 
Road-cleaning machine according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 
suction nozzle (9) can be adjusted to different heights above the road surface (28).
