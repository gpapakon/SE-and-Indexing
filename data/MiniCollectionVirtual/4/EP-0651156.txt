<ABSTRACT>
An air-assisted single jet injector (1) in which a valve 
shutter (11) actuated by an electromagnetic actuator (7) 

controls the formation of jets of fuel through 
atomisation orifices (15) formed in a delivery element 

(5) downstream of which an auxiliary atomisation chamber 
(21) is arranged, defined internally at least in part by 

a frusto-conical surface (24b) into which open radial

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electromagnetically
controlled fuel injector, of the air-assisted single jet
type, for the fuel supply of a motor vehicle engine.In particular, the present invention relates to a "Pico"
type injector, operable to atomise the fuel by injecting
it through a delivery element which can produce a flow
through a thin wall.Electromagnetic fuel injectors for vehicle engines are
known in which fuel injection is regulated by an
electromagnetic actuator which controls the movement of
a valve shutter which controls the formation of jets of
fuel though atomisation orifices in a delivery element.
By causing the fuel to flow through the orifices, the
length of which is far smaller than their respective
diameter, aero-hydrodynamic effects on the liquid occur
to atomise it, reducing it to very small droplets. By
decreasing the thickness of the wall of the delivery
element to a dimension of the order of tenths of a
millimetre, it is possible to obtain droplets having a
diameter of 180-200 micrometres. It is difficult to
obtain a more forceful atomisation as any further
reduction in the thickness of the wall would involve
manufacturing problems and problems with clogging and
excessive wear of the orifices. For improving fuel atomisation, are known in the art, for
example from EP 0 480 329 Al, injectors in which the atomised
fuel jet is mixed with an auxiliary air flow before being
injected into the combustion chamber.However, the atomisation effect obtained with these
injectors is not very powerful and in addition their
structure means that they have a rather short working
life, since they generally wear quickly.The object of the present invention is to provide a fuel
injector that is free from the disadvantages of the prior
art, gives a fine atomisation of the fuel and is easily
produced simply by modifying the structure of prior art
injectors, adding or replacing a small number of
inexpensive parts.The invention thus provides an injector with a powerful
atomisation capacity, in particular for the fuel supply
of a motor vehicle engine, as defined in claim 1. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention
will become apparent from the following description of
two non-limitative embodiments with reference to the
appended drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is an elevation of a first preferred
embodiment of the present invention, sectioned
longitudinally along the axis of the injector;Figure 2 shows, on an enlarged scale and in section,
