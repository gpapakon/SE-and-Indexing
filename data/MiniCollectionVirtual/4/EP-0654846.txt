<ABSTRACT>
A feed horn (100) includes a top side (114) and a 
bottom side (116). A left side (118) connects one edge of 

the top side (114) with one edge of the bottom side (116). 
A right side (120) connects an opposite edge of the top 

side (114) with an opposite edge of the bottom (116). The 
improved feed horn (100) includes an attenuation device 

(130, 199) connected to an outer surface of at least one 
of the top and bottom sides (114, 116) for absorbing 

microwave energy of far-out side lobes. The attenuation 
means (130, 199) includes a plurality of fins (134, 200, 

202). The top and bottom sides are normal to an electric

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to feed horns and, more
particularly, to feed horns including an attenuation fin
blanket.Horn antennas or feed horns have been widely used as
a feed element for large radioastronomy, satellite
tracking and communications dishes which primarily operate
using microwave frequencies. In addition to the utility
of the feed horn as a feed for reflectors and lenses, the
feed horn is a common element of phased arrays and serves
as a universal standard for calibration and gain
measurement.Radio Engineering and Electronic physics, Vol. 25,
No. 12, December 1980, Washington, U.S., discloses a
feed horn and attenuation means connected to an outer
surface of at least one of the top and bottom sides of
the horn, including a plurality of fins.The total field radiated by the feed horn is a
combination of a direct field and diffractions from edges
of an aperture of the feed horn. Edge diffractions,
particularly those occurring at edges which are normal to
an electric field, influence the radiation pattern of the
antenna. The diffractions generate microwave energy in
main (or on-axis) lobes, near lobes, far-out side lobes
and back lobes. However, the microwave energy generated
by the diffractions in the far-out side lobes and back
lobes has a much greater and undesirable effect. By
reducing far-out side lobes and back lobes, the effects of
radio frequency interference can be reduced significantly. Optimum feed horns maximize the main (or on-axis) lobe
and minimize far-out side and back lobes. Conventional
methods of reducing the effects of diffraction include
corrugations on the inside surface of the feed horn,
curving the walls of the feed horn near the aperture, and
connecting a C-shaped metal attachment to the outer
surface of the feed horn.However, such prior approaches have been undesirable
due to increased weight which can be critical in satellite
applications. Attenuation of the far-out side and back
lobes has been insufficient to meet commercial needs for
reduced radio frequency interference. In addition, feed
horns typically require an aperture cover to provide
thermal stability and to prevent contamination. However,
fitting the aperture cover over the aperture of feed horns
with curved walls has proven to be difficult.Therefore, it is desirable to design a lightweight
feed horn producing radiation patterns with highly
attenuated far-out side and back lobes without significant
weight increase.According to the present invention there is provided a feed horn that
absorbs microwave energy
