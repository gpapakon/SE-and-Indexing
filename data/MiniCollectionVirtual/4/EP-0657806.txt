<ABSTRACT>
A programmable microprocessor control system 
includes a microprocessor (13) in bus communication with 

a plurality integrated of circuit modules (ASIC) (15), 
one of which integrated circuit modules is a interrupt 

controller (700). The microprocessor (13) is also in bus 
communication with memory units (Mu). Each of the 

integrated circuit modules generates a plurality of 
control signals in response to data placed on the bus by 

the microprocessor (13) and also generates one or more of 
a plurality of interrupt signals of one or more of a 

plurality of status types (INTR-0 through INTR-7), the 
interrupts representing a respective status of the source 

circuit module. The interrupt controller (700) includes 
a first group of programmable registers for enabling 

respective one of the interrupts (INTR0-INTR7) for each 
of the respective source circuit modules. and generating 

a respective masked interrupt signal (IMR(1)-IMR(6) of 
that type upon receiving an interrupt signal of that type 

from any one of source circuit modules. A prioritizing 
circuit is provided for receiving the masked interrupt 

signal (IMR(1)-IMR(6) and generating one of a plurality 
of priority interrupt signal (IP1-IP3) in response to a 

respective one of the masked interrupt signal (IMR(1)-IMR(6) 
wherein the number of priority interrupt signal 

(IP1-IP3) is less than the number of masked interrupt 
signals (IMR(1)-IMR(6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuit 
systems and, more particularly, to integrated circuit 
systems having a plurality of operating modules and a 
means of prioritizing the interrupt signals generated by 
the respective modules signalling a module condition or 
state. European patent applications of even date are filed 
concurrently herewith corresponding to the following US 
applications commonly assigned to Pitney Bowes Inc.: US 
Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,627, entitled 
MULTIPLE PULSE WIDTH MODULATION CIRCUIT; US Patent 
Application Serial No. 08/165,134, entitled DUAL MODE 
TIMER-COUNTER; US Patent Application Serial No. 
08/137,460, entitled DYNAMICALLY PROGRAMMABLE TIMER-COUNTER; 
US Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,774, 
entitled MEMORY ACCESS PROTECTION CIRCUIT WITH ENCRYPTION 
KEY; US Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,811, 
entitled MEMORY MONITORING CIRCUIT FOR DETECTING 
UNAUTHORIZED MEMORY ACCESS; US Patent Application Serial 
No. 08/163,771, entitled MULTI-MEMORY ACCESS LIMITING 
CIRCUIT FOR A MULTI-MEMORY DEVICE; US Patent Application 
Serial No. 08/163,790, entitled ADDRESS DECODER WITH

Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,812, entitled 
ADDRESS DECODER WITH MEMORY WAIT STATE CIRCUIT; US Patent 
Application Serial No. 08/163,813, entitled ADDRESS 
DECODER WITH MEMORY ALLOCATION AND ILLEGAL ADDRESS 
DETECTION FOR A MICRO-CONTROLLER SYSTEM; US Patent 
Application Serial No. 08/164,100, entitled PROGRAMMABLE 
CLOCK MODULE FOR POSTAGE METERING CONTROL SYSTEM; and US 
Patent Application Serial No. 08/163,629, entitled 
CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AN ELECTRONIC POSTAGE METER HAVING A 
PROGRAMMABLE APPLICATION SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUIT.  The disclosure of these co-pending European 
applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference. It is conventional to use integrated circuit systems 
to control system operation such as employed in 
electronic postage metering (EPM) systems. It is 
customary to develop a unique control system for each 
specific model of an apparatus. For example, each 
postage meter model has a microcontroller system 
specifically designed for controlling the function set of 
that electronic postage meter model. The microcontroller 
system is customarily comprised of a microprocessor in 
bus communication with a number of memory units and an 
applications specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It is 
now considered advantageous to develop a single 
microcontroller for a plurality of meter models
