<ABSTRACT>
A quick tripping switch, particularly for an 
automobile power window device, comprising:

 
   a housing (1) of plastic material containing at 

least two facing fixed (14,15) contacts;
 

   at least one mobile contact (22) substantially in 
form of a lamina, said mobile contact being power 

supplied and interposed between the two fixed 
contacts so as to engage one at a time;

 
   a control push button (2), movable against the 

bias of a spring. 
The mobile contact lamina consists of two 
branch portions (23,29) jointed forming an L, and is 

pivotally mounted proximate to its angle on its 
branch portion engaged by the control push button.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a switch for 
actuating an electric device. Particularly, the 
invention relates to a quick tripping switch for 
actuating an automobile power window. Such a switch according to the preamble of claim 1 is described for example in FR-A-2 221 801. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a switch of the aforesaid kind having a 
quick tripping regardless of the actuating speed, 
wherein the tripping stroke is variable according to 
requirements. Also, it is an object of the invention 
to provide a switch capable of performing a sliding 
effect on the contacts so as to clean same, and 
capable of providing such a sliding effect both in 
closing and opening the contact. It is a further object of the invention to 
provide such a switch constructed with the least 
parts possible, well protected with respect to 
atmospheric agents and having particularly reduced 
overall dimensions. Further, it is an object of the 
invention to provide a switch that can be 
constructed as much as possible through automatic 
production cycles. In order to attain the aforesaid objects, the  
 
present invention provides a quick tripping switch 
for controlling an electric device, particularly an 
automobile power window device, comprising: 
a housing of plastic material containing at 
least two facing fixed contacts; at least one mobile contact substantially in 
form of a lamina, said mobile contact being power 
supplied and having a first branch portion 
interposed between said two fixed contacts so as to 
engage one at a time; a control push button mounted oscillating on 
the housing, said push button being adapted for 
actuating a second branch portion of said mobile 
contact;  
characterised in that the mobile contact lamina 
consists of two branch portions jointed forming an 
L, and is pivotally mounted proximate to its angle 
on the branch portion engaged by said control push 
button, said fixed contacts being disposed vertical 
within the housing, the first branch portion of the 
mobile contact being adapted for moving between said 
fixed contacts responsive to pressure applied to 
said push button against the bias of an elastic 
member. Further characteristics and advantages will be  
 
more apparent hereinafter from the following 
description with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which: 
FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a switch 
according to the present invention;  FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 
II-II of FIG. 1; FIGS. 3 to 5 are partial 
cross

<CLAIMS>
A quick tripping switch for controlling an 
electric device, particularly an automobile power 

window device, comprising: 

a housing (1) of plastic material containing at 
least two facing fixed contacts (14,15); 
at least one mobile contact (22) substantially in 
form of a lamina, said mobile contact being power 

supplied and having a first branch portion 
interposed between said two fixed contacts so as to 

engage one at a time; 
a control push button (2) mounted oscillating on 
the housing (1), said push button being adapted for 

actuating a second branch portion of said mobile 
contact; 
 
characterised in that the mobile contact lamina 

consists of two branch portions (23,29) jointed forming an 
L, and is pivotally mounted proximate to its angle 

on the branch portion engaged by said control push 
button, said fixed contacts (14,15) being disposed vertical 

within the housing, the first branch portion of the 
mobile contact (22) being adapted for moving between said 

fixed contacts responsive to pressure applied to 
said push button against the bias of an elastic 

member.  
 
A switch according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the push button (2) has curved edges (4) enveloping the 

upper part of the housing (1). 
A switch according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the lamina of the mobile contact (22) is pivotally 

mounted to a support having an abutment laterally 
displaced with respect to the pivoting point, said 

abutment being adapted for co-operation with said 
second branch portion (29) for urging said first branch 

portion (23) upwardly when pressure is exerted on the 
push button (2). 
A switch according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the pivoting point is a folded portion integral 

with the second branch portion of the of the mobile 
contact (22). 
A switch according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the elastic member is a tongue (26) obtained 

integral with the lamina of the mobile contact (22). 
A switch according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the lamina engages a third fixed electric 

contact located within the housing (1). 
A switch according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a further fixed electric contact (33) is located 

within the housing (1) for co-operation with said second 
branch portion of the lamina.  

 
A switch according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the push button (2) has an appendix extending 

towards the inside of the housing, said appendix 
having an end adapted for co-operation with a spring 

member (35) fitted to the bottom of the housing (1) so as 
hold the push button in at least one predetermined 

position.
