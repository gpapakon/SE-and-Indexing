<ABSTRACT>
New aminoacid derivates have the general formula (I), in which the group B stands for A2 - NR2R3 or R5; the group R5 stands for one of the groups (II), (III) or (IV), and R1, A1, A2, R2, R3, R6, R7, R8, R9, X, Y, Z, t and u have the meanings given in the description. Also disclosed are the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these compounds, as well as their production and use. These new compounds are precious neuroquinine (tachyquinine) antagonists.
