<ABSTRACT>
The lighting (illumination) for the refrigerated space, which can be closed by means of a door or flap, of a refrigerator or freezer consists of a bulb (12) which is held in a socket. So as to prevent a contact spark from being produced when a bulb (12) is exchanged when the door of the refrigerator or the freezer is open, the bulb (12) is enclosed by a releasable (detachable) and at least partially transparent cap or hood (7) which seals, in a hermetically tight manner, the space which accomodates the bulb (12). A locking device of the cap (7) or the cap (7) itself interacts with a switch (13, 14) in such a manner that the overall circuit or the circuit of the bulb is interrupted when the cap (7) is released, before the sealing of the space is broken (lifted, neutralised), with the result that the overall device or the bulb can be operated only with a hermetically sealed cap.
