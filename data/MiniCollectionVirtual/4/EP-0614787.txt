<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a driver-side airbag restraint system for vehicles a pressurised gas container (12), for filling the airbag (18) arranged on the steering-wheel hub, is arranged outside the steering wheel. At its transition to the steering wheel the gas inlet is sealed off by an annular sealing gap (30), between a gap-limiting surface formed on the steering-wheel hub and an opposite gap-limiting surface on a wall, which is fixed with respect to the vehicle body, without these gap-limiting surfaces coming into contact with each other. By virtue of its dimensions and arrangement relative to the flow direction of the gases, the sealing gap (30) makes it possible for external air to be sucked in by the action of the gas flow in the interior of the gas inlet.

A driver-side gas bag restraining system for vehicles,
comprising a compressed gas storage (12) arranged outside

the steering wheel (16) for filling the gas bag (18)
arranged on the steering wheel hub (16A) and a gas duct

means arranged between the compressed gas storage (12) and
the inlet port of the gas bag (18), in which at its transition

to the steering wheel (16) the gas duct means is sealed
off by an annular sealing gap (30) between a first gap

defining surface formed on the steering wheel hub (16A) and
an oppositely arranged second gap defining surface on a wall

(24A), which is stationary in relation to the vehicle bodywork,
of the gas duct means without contact between these

gap defining surfaces, in which the sealing gap (30), owing
to its dimensions and its arrangement in relation to the

direction of the flow of the gases, renders possible the
entrainment of air from the surroundings through the sealing

gap (30) under the action of the gas flow inside the gas
duct means as a result of a jet pump effect and in which the

gas duct means comprises a pot-shaped distribution chamber
(24) which annularly surrounds the steering shaft (14) and

on which the second gap defining surface is formed, the
sealing gap between the gas duct means and the surroundings

constituting a substantially linear flow path, characterized
in that the second gap defining surface is formed by a

flexible sealing lip (40; 50) which in the rest condition
is arranged parallel to the first gap defining surface. 
The gas bag restraining system according to claim 1,
characterized in that the sealing gap (30; 30E) is able to

be closed by the sealing lip (40; 50) able to be deflected
owing to the flow pressure in the gas duct means during

filling of the gas bag (18).
The gas bag restraining system according to claim 2,
characterized in that on decreasing gas pressure and/or

opposite direction of flow in the gas duct means the sealing
lip (40; 50) clears the sealing gap (30; 30E) again and

renders possible escape of the gas from the gas bag (18).
The gas bag restraining system according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the compressed

gas storage (12) comprises a generally cylindrical elongated
pressure container arranged parallel to the steering column

(10) and connected with the interior space of the distribution
chamber (24) by a pipe (22) arranged parallel to the

steering column (10) and outside the same.
The gas bag restraining system according to any one of
the preceding claims, for a steering wheel able to be

adjusted axially, characterized in that the pipe is made
up of telescoping sections (22A, 22B).
The gas bag restraining system according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that the sealing gap

(30) is formed between the cylindrical peripheral part (24A)
of the wall defining the distribution chamber (24) and the

inner side of a skirt (16B) surrounding the distribution
chamber (24) and formed integrally with the steering wheel

hub (16A).
The gas bag restraining system according to any one of
the preceding claims, characterized in that in the hub (16A)

of the steering wheel, between lands (28) arranged spoke-like,
a plurality of gas penetration openings (26) is formed 

which each has side surfaces converging towards the distribution
chamber (24).
A steering wheel for a gas bag restraining system according
to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in

that it constitutes a premounted assembly (60) together with
the gas bag (18A) which is in the form of a ring of hose, is

folded up and is provided with a cover (20A).
