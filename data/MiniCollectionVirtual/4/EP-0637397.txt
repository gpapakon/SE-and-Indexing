<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an integral burst sensing disk assembly (8) wherein a disk (10) forms an integral part of the burst sensing circuit (24, 26, 28, 30, 32). The improvement of the instant invention comprises using a rupture disk to form a complete circuit between a wire (26) connected to the burst membrane portion (14) of the disk, through the disk to another wire (28) connected to the outer surface (20a) of the disk. When the disk bursts to relieve an overpressure situation, the circuit is broken and a signal sent to indicate that the disk has burst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rupture disks that obturate
a relief port in a fluid system, and more particularly to
an assembly for sensing when a rupture disk bursts.Rupture disks are commonly used in industry as safety
devices. In order to indicate that a closed system has
been relieved of an over-pressure condition the rupture
disks can operate in conjunction with sensing devices.
Whether the fluid system is a positive or negative pressure
system, the disks function to relieve pressure by bursting
when a designated pressure (or vacuum) is reached. The
rupture disk can be connected to a sensor and signalling
device, which alerts operators that the disk has burst.
Disks and sensors vary in design and in the materials used,
but typically have an outer annular mounting portion
surrounding an inner, pressure-sensitive membrane portion
that blocks a flow of fluid in a relief port. The typical
sensor and signalling device operating in conjunction with
the disk is triggered when the disk bursts and breaks an
electrical circuit, creating a signal at, e.g., a
monitoring station.US 4978947 discloses a non-integral rupture disk and
sensor assembly in which a U-shaped conductor is
encapsulated within a resinous rupture member.The instant invention provides an advantageous and
improved integral rupture disk and sensor assembly. By
integrating the sensor and disk into a single factory
assembled unit, high quality performance can be assured by 
factory testing prior to shipment to a customer. This
simplifies installation procedures and thus reduces risk of
error and damage during installation. When the disk leaves
the factory it is ready for immediate and uncomplicated
installation between standard pipe flanges. The disk
assembly is highly tamper-proof and significantly reduces
the possibility of failed signals due to accidental
maintenance of a closed circuit after burst. To achieve the advantages of the instant invention there is provided an
integral rupture disk and sensor assembly comprising a rupture disk that is made
of a conductive material, preferably graphite. which has a fragmenting pressure
sensitive membrane portion and an outer circumferential surface. a first conductor
secured to the pressure sensitive membrane portion and a second conductor
secured to the outer circumferential surface. The conductors are adapted to form
a complete circuit through the disk, i.e., the rupture disk itself is part of a
complete circuit, such that when the pressure sensitive portion fragments or
bursts, the circuit is broken.
