<ABSTRACT>
An azo color for color filters which has at least one monosubstituted sulfonamide group in its molecule and is 
soluble in an aqueous alkali solution and organic solvents, and a process for producing a color filter having a number 

of colored filter elements which comprises the step (a) of forming an adherent layer by coating a substrate with a 
solution of a photoresist composition containing the azo colors in an organic solvent and drying the coating, the step 

(b) of exposing a predetermined part of the adherent layer to a radiation, the step (c) of forming a colored pattern by 
the alkaline development of an exposed or nonexposed area, and the step (d) of repeating the steps (a) through (c) 

with each of the different colors contained in the above composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to azo dyes for use in
color filters, and more particularly to magenta-colored,
red-colored or yellow-colored azo dyes for use in color
filters.Color filters, particularly the color filters
used in solid-state image sensors such as charge
combination device (CCD), liquid crystal display device
(LCD) and the like, are usually produced by first
forming a pattern from a photoresist and subsequently
dyeing the pattern. However, this method is disadvantageous
in that the dying process is complicated and
difficult to control. Thus, JP-A-4-163552 and JP-A-4-128703
have proposed methods for producing color filters
by patterning a photoresist containing a dyestuff such
as pigment or dye. However, the method of JP-A-4-163552
is not suitable for production of color filters for use
in CCD requiring a high resolution, because the pigment
itself used therein contains particles of about 1 µm
size. On the other hand, the method of JP-A-4-128703 is
inferior in the stability of colored pattern. In
addition to the above, these methods both involve 
another important problem. That is, usual dyestuffs
exist as an extraneous matter different from the alkali-developable
resist. In the case of producing a color
filter, the preferable thickness of resist film is 1 µm
or less, unlike the case of producing a semi-conductor.
For this reason, a large amount of dyestuffs must be
added to a resist composition comprising an alkalisoluble
resin and an organic solvent. Actual dyestuffs,
however, are soluble in neither of aqueous alkali
solution and organic solvent, and therefore it is
difficult to prepare a fine color pattern having a
desired spectrum and a small film thickness from such
dyestuffs.EP-A-132 577 refers to blue-green monoazo dyes comprising a
group of the formula -NH-SO2-R2.EP-A-003 376 discloses photographic materials and dyestuffs
comprising a group -SO2-NH-.US-A-3 346 550 discloses azo dyestuffs containing an SO2NH-group.FR-A-2 407 498 discloses a color sensitive photographic film
and azo compounds containing a sulfonamido group.CH 567 550 discloses azo pigments containing a sulfonamido or
a sulfamoyl group. This invention solves the above-mentioned
problem by providing an azo dye as claimed in claim 1 for use in color filters
excellent in spectral characteristics such as light
absorption characteristic, permeation characteristic,
etc. which can be used for preparing a resist composition
for color filters excellent in properties such as
resolution and free from scum, namely undeveloped
residue,
