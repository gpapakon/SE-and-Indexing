<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition 
with a novel pharmaceutical use containing a histamine-added 

gamma-globulin as an effective component. 
The invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition 
containing a histamine-added gamma-globulin used as an 

immunomodulating agent, a suppressive agent for eosinophilia, an 
antiinflammatory agent, etc. 
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention has 
an immunomodulating action which is clearly different from the 

conventional immunosuppressive agents. Accordingly, said composition 
is useful as a pharmaceutical agent for the therapy of the 

diseases with abnormal immune system such as, for example, chronic 
articular rheumatism, systemic lupus erythematosis, multiple 

sclerosis, etc. and various types of immunodeficiency syndromes. 
In addition, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention 

also exhibits a suppressive action on a hypereosinophilicity 
and can be used as a therapeutic agent for infectious diseases, 

parasitic diseases, respiratory diseases, autoimmune diseases and 
eosinophilia caused by malignant tumor, etc. as well as an excellent 

antiinflammatory agent wherein said composition is very 
useful

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel use of a histamine-added
gamma-globulin as a
pharmaceutical and, more particularly, it relates to an immunomodulating
agent, a suppressive agent to hypereosinophilicity and
an antiinflammatory agent containing the histamine-added gamma-globulin
as an effective component.The product used in the present invention is known as a histamine-added
gamma-globulin preparation, and exhibits the action of
recovering the histamine fixing ability which is lowered in the
patients suffering from allergy and asthma and is used as an
agent for nonspecific hyposensitizing therapy for bronchial
asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic skin diseases such as
urticaria, chronic eczema, atopic dermatitis, etc. It has been
also known that this agent exhibits a suppressive action to a
histamine liberation and, since it has no side action of antihistaminics
and adrenocortical hormones used as symptomatic remedies,
it has been widely used as a pharmaceutical agent with high
safety.An object of the present invention is thus the use of histamine-added
Î³-globulin for the manufacture
of a medicament
effective as an immunomodulating agent, a
hypereosinophilicity suppressive agent and an antiinflammatory agent.The present inventors have conducted an extensive investigation
on said histamine-added gamma-globulin and found its novel
pharmacological action, i.e. an immunomodulating action and a
suppressive action to hypereosinophilicity, whereby the present
invention has been achieved. Histamine-added gamma-globulin,
the effective component of the present invention
can be manufactured by an adequate mixing of a gamma-globulin
component with a histamine component. Human gamma-globulin
used in the present invention may be prepared from serum
or from placenta plasma or the like by conventional means while,
with respect to a histamine component, free histamine or a pharmacologically-acceptable
salt thereof (e.g. hydrochloride,
phosphate, picrate, etc.) may be utilized. In the manufacture of
the product of the present invention, 100 to 200 mg (preferably 5
to 50 mg) of gamma-globulin may, for example, be mixed with 0.01
to 2 micrograms (preferably 0.05 to 0.5 microgram) of histamine
component by a suitable means.The product of the present invention is mostly used as an
injection and, therefore, it can be made into a pharmaceutical
composition as an isotonic solution using distilled water for
injection or a physiological saline solution. In its manufacture,
additives such as auxiliary solubilizers,
