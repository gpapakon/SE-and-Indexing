<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for changing the scale of a pattern 
printed from a total internal reflection hologram (9) into a 

photosensitive layer (13) that includes reconstructing an image 
from the total internal reflection hologram by illuminating 

said total internal reflection hologram with a scanning beam (17) 
and moving at least one of the hologram and photosensitive 

layer such that the magnitude of movement of the hologram 
relative to the photosensitive layer is equal to that of the 

scanning beam multiplied by the change of the scale required 
and also such that if the change of scale is a magnification 

the direction of the movement of the hologram relative to 
the photosensitive layer is the same as that of the scanning 

beam whereas if the change of scale is a compression then 
the direction of the movement of the hologram relative to 

the photosensitive layer is opposite to that of the scanning 
beam, and optionally comprising also introducing 

convergence or divergence into the scanning beam so that the 
image locally reconstructed from the TIR hologram possesses 

the change in the scale.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of microlithography, in
particular to microlithography based on total internal
reflection holography.Devices composed of microstructures, most notably integrated
circuits and active-matrix liquid crystals displays, largely
depend on photolithographic methods for their manufacture.
The most common form of photolithography executes a transfer
of a pattern of features defined in a mask into a
photosensitive layer on a substrate surface. Following
development of the photosensitive layer the substrate is
subjected to a chemical treatment such as an etching,
deposition or implantation, in order that the pattern
recorded in the layer is transferred into a material that
will provide the required device characteristics. For most
device applications this sequence is performed not just once
but several times using different mask patterns and
different post-exposure treatments to construct the complex,
many-layered structure of the device.For these multi-exposure processes it is important that the
features in each layer are accurately registered, or
aligned, with respect to those in other layers. Quantifying
this, the alignment must typically be carried out to an
accuracy of ∼1/5 of the dimension of the smallest feature. 
Lithographic equipment performs alignment by measuring the
degree of misalignment between reference marks included in
the mask and on the wafer and then translating and/ or
rotating the mask (or wafer) to its aligned position, after
which exposure can proceed.There are cases however where this procedure is insufficient
for ensuring accurate overlay of features over the entire
exposure field, at least not without compromising the size
of the field. Some post-exposure treatments, especially
thermal processings, can cause an appreciable expansion or
shrinkage of the substrate material which may be as large as
1 part in 104, whereby a 50 cm substrate may expand by as
much as 50 µm.One way of achieving good overlay in these cases is to
reduce the size of the exposure field so that the increase
in substrate dimensions over that field becomes negligible
compared to the overlay accuracy required. For large
substrates however this would demand a large number of
exposure operations to cover the complete substrate area,
and this, for a commercial process where throughput is of
paramount importance, would be undesirable. The preferred
approach is to measure the magnitude of the substrate
expansion or shrinkage using the reference alignment marks
and then to magnify or
