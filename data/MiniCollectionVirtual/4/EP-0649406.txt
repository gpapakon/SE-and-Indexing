<ABSTRACT>
Novel carbazole derivatives of formula (I) in which R1 is H, benzyl, alkyl; R2 and R3 are carbethoxy, acetyl, nitrile, ( alpha ), H, R2 and R3 however cannot together be H, or R2 and R3 form the following rings: (a), (b), (c), R4 is H, Cl, methoxy, nitrile, nitro; R5, R7 and R8 are H or methoxy, R6 is H or methyl; provided that if R2 and R3 form the ring (c), at least one of R1, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 does not denote H. The invention also concerns the use in cosmetics of these novel compounds as pigments, and especially in cosmetic compositions for the treatment and/or colouring of keratin substances.
