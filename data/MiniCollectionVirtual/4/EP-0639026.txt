<ABSTRACT>
A method of analyzing color film, comprising the steps of 
displaying images of a plurality of pictures in a matrix 

pattern on an image display device, specifying one of said 
color images of said plurality of picture frames and 

displaying a cursor overlapping a part of said specified 
image, said cursor having a color which is different from the 

color of said part of said specified image, wherein said 
cursor has a color which is changed from an identical 

positive color of said part to a negative of said part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
used for analysing or inspecting color films.Video type color film analyzers are well known in the art.
One example disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
No. JP-A-62 - 141,530 has a color TV camera for providing color image
data of picture frames of a number of rolls of color films
spliced one another. The color image data of the respective
picture frames are stored in a memory. The color image data of
each picture frame read out from the memory is, after having
been transformed in gradation based on its large area
transmittance density (LATD) and transformed from negative form
to positive form, sent to one of a plurality of CRT displays
arranged in a line to display a simulated color image thereon.
Color film analyzer of this type can display a plurality of
color images, simulated and to be simulated, on the CRT
displays in a line. The center CRT display displays a color
image under inspection and/or correction and the remaining CRT
displays, in particular on one side of the center CRT display,
color images inspected and corrected if needed and, on the 
opposite side of the center display, color images to be
inspected. Therefore, the simulated color image on the center
CRT display can be estimated comparing with adjacent corrected
and uncorrected color images.In another color film analyzer of this type disclosed in, for
example, U.S. Patent Nos. US-A-4 364 084 and US-A-4 531 150, the color
images simulated or to be simulated are displayed in a matrix
pattern. Any one of the displayed color images, if undesirable
in color and/or density as a printed image, is specified with
such as a light pen to correct exposure. Image data of the
specified image is transformed in gradation according to the
corrected exposure so that the color image is correctly
changed in color and/or density.The image data of picture frames to be displayed are written
in and read out from an image memory as is disclosed in, for
example, European Unexamined Patent Publication No. EP-A-0 108 158.Such video type color film analyzers are associated with
various drawbacks. Because a roll of color film often
includes frames bearing unintended principal subject images,
blurred images or the like which usually need not be printed.
The color film analyzers heretofore used are hard to specify
an image or images which are unnecessary to print from visual
inspection. It is therefore often to repeatedly specify
picture frames having no necessity of print.A cursor, usually used

<CLAIMS>
A method of analyzing a color film having a plurality of picture frames, comprising the
steps of:


displaying images of a plurality of picture frames in a matrix pattern on an image
display device,
converting said images into image signals and transforming same into numerical
data,
specifying one of said color images of said plurality of picture frames,
displaying a cursor overlapping a part of said specified image,
comparing the numerical image data of said cursor with the numerical image data
of said image part where said cursor is displayed,
and changing the color of said cursor by one of increasing and decreasing said
image data of said cursor by a constant amount if said image data of said cursor is similar

to the image data of said image part of the specified image.
