<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
methods for producing polycarbonates utilizing a
single component tertiary amine catalyst system. More
particularly, the invention relates to methods for producing
high molecular weight polycarbonate resins
by a solventless melt condensation reaction
between diphenyl carbonate (DPC) and bisphenol A (BPA) in
the presence of tertiary amine catalyst.EP-A-0535261 discloses a process for producing a
polycarbonate by melt polycondensing a dihydric phenol
and biphenyl carbonate in the presence of a catalyst
selected from electron donative amine compounds and a
catalyst selected from alkali metal compounds and
alkaline earth metal compounds.A number of catalytic systems have been examined for
application to melt polycarbonates. Most of these
methods require either a variety of co-catalysts or the
subsequent addition of a catalyst quencher to ensure
polymer stability. The need for high purity, high
quality thermoplastic resins requires the reduction of
residual contaminants in the final resin. This need for
minimal residual impurities is particularly acute in
optical quality (OQ) grade polycarbonate resins. One
approach towards elimination of residual solvent
contamination (particularly methylene chloride)
implements a solventless (melt) process.Most current melt technology programs employ a two
component catalyst system. The first component is 
tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH or β-catalyst) which
is used to initiate oligomer formation in the melt. The
TMAH decomposes in the first two reactors to produce a
variety of products, some of which contaminate the final
polymer. The second catalyst is sodium hydroxide
("sodium" or Na; the α-catalyst) which is the finishing
catalyst. Due to its intrinsic stability, the α-catalyst
must be quenched. This quenching process requires the
addition of yet another component to the polymer
formulation. All the materials from the quenching
process remain in the final resin, further contaminating
the final polymer.The use of a thermally stable, volatile tertiary
amine catalyst circumvents the degradation problem of the
β-catalyst and the need for additional reagents due to
the use of an α-catalyst. Volatile amines provide the
advantage of being "self-quenching", i.e., these
catalysts slowly distill from the resin over the course
of the reaction. As a result, no additional quencher is
needed and no detrimental catalyst residue is left in the
final resin.A variety of basic tertiary amine catalysts were
examined for their efficiency to form high
