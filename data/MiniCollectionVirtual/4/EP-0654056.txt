<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for improving the polyurethane-forming reactivity of a propylene oxide-based ethylene oxide-free polyol produced using a double metal cyanide complex catalyst by incorporating therein a minor amount of a base prior to employing the polyol in a polyurethane-forming reaction. Also claimed is the base-containing polyol composition produced in accordance with the present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to polyols
produced using double metal cyanide complex catalysts
and, more specifically, to a process for improving the
reactivity of double metal cyanide complex catalyzed
polyols.The use of double metal cyanide complex ("DMC")
catalysts in the preparation of polyols having low
ethylenic unsaturation is well-established in the art,
as illustrated, for example, by US-A-3,829,505.
The polyols prepared using these catalysts can be
fabricated to have a higher molecular weight and/or a
lower amount of end group unsaturation than can be
prepared using commonly-employed potassium hydroxide
("KOH") catalysts. The '505 patent discloses that these
high molecular weight polyol products are suitably
reacted with polyisocyanates to prepare rigid or
flexible polyurethanes.Unfortunately, it has now been found by the
present inventors that, when utilizing polyols other
than ethylene oxide ("EO")-capped polyols, the
reactivity of the polyols made with DMC catalysts is
less than otherwise might be desired in the subsequent
reaction of the polyol with an isocyanate to produce a
polyurethane.A solution to this problem of less-than-desired
reactivity would be highly desired by the DMC-catalyzed
polyol manufacturing community. The present invention
provides one solution to this problem. In one aspect, the present invention relates to a process for enhancing the
reactivity of a polyol free of ethylene oxide capping produced using a double metal cyanide catalyst which comprises
incorporating into said polyol between 0.5 and 10 ppm based on the weight of said polyol of a base selected from an alkali
metal hydroxide, alkali metal alkoxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide, alkaline earth
metal alkoxide, or a combination thereof.In another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for producing a
base-containing polyol having enhanced reactivity toward polyisocyanates which comprises
the steps of:
(a) forming a polyol having a backbone comprising moieties selected from
the group comprising ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and combinations thereof, said
polyol being produced using a double metal cyanide catalyst and being free of ethylene oxide capping and removing any residual
double metal cyanide catalyst by treating the polyol with hydrogen peroxide(b) incorporating into said polyol between 0.5 and 10 ppm based on the weight of said polyol of a base as
described above.These and other aspects will become apparent upon
reading the following detailed description of the
invention.It has now
