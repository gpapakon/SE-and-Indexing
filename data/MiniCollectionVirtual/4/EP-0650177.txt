Method for driving a plurality of relay operating 
coils which are connected in parallel to a common voltage 

source and can each be switched on and off by relay 
circuit means assigned to them, the relay operating coils 

(Rel 1, Rel 2) to be switched on in each case being 
driven at a duty ratio (Tx,/Ty), after reaching their 

pull-in state (t1) , via relay circuit means from a common 
clock generator (TG), in such a manner that a steady 

state holding current which is less than the pull-in 
state occurs, characterized in that the relay operating 

coils (Rel 1, Rel 2) can be switched off by common 
switching-off means (s0), the respective relay operating 

coil switching means remaining closed for those relay 
operating coils which are intended to continue to operate 

with the holding current in a steady state (Fig. 5), so 
that a briefly rising pull-in current (i2(t)) occurs in 

the associated relay operating coil (Rel 2) which, after 
a predetermined time (t1) is driven once again by the 

clock generator (TG) at a duty ratio (Tx/Ty). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the predetermined time is governed by the time 

duration required for the respective relay operating coil 
to reach the pull-in state. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the relay operating coils used are of the same type. 
Method according to Claims 1 and 3, characterized 
in that, if only a sub-group of relay operating coils are 

of the same type, the method is applied to this type 
group.  

 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the predetermined time duration is calculated and 

set by a microprocessor. 
Use of a circuit arrangement for carrying out the 
method according to Claim 1, one diode (D1, D2) in each 

case being connected in parallel with the respective 
relay operating coil (Rel 1, Rel 2), each diode being 

connected in the reverse direction to the voltage source 
(Ub) via a common zener diode (Z) connected in series in 

the reverse direction, common switching-off means (s0) 
being connected in parallel with the zener diode.
