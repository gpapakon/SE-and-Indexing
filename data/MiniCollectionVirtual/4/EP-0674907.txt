<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a soluble conjugate wherein a carrier protein is covalently linked 

to a monoclonal antibody, a pharmaceutical preparation comprising such 
a conjugate and a 

method for the preparation thereof. The conjugate of the invention 
is useful e.g. for active immunotherapy of a mammal, particularly a human. 
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the conjugate comprises 
CRM197 and an antibody containing the light chain and/or heavy chain 

variable regions of the antibody designated MK2-CHγl 
or the antibody designated MK2-23.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a soluble conjugate of a monoclonal antibody and a carrier 
protein. The present invention further provides a method for preparing such an 
antibody-carrier protein conjugate, a pharmaceutical preparation comprising said 
conjugate and a method for evoking an antibody response in a mammal. A monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody is an antibody reactive with an antibody variable 
region epitope (idiotope). Therefore, an anti-idiotypic antibody is often designated as Ab 2 
(antibody 2) while the immunizing antibody used for the production of Ab 2 is referred to 
as Ab 1 (antibody 1). Since an antibody (Ab 1) has multiple idiotopes, some associated 
with its antigen binding site (paratopes) and others associated with framework 
determinants of the variable region domain, the complementary antibody response thereto 
is functionally and structurally heterogeneous and can be divided into three major 
categories (H.C.J. Ertl and C.A. Bona, Vaccine 6, 80-84 (1988)). One of these categories 
refers to Ab 2 recognizing a paratope-associated idiotope as Ab 2β. An antibody of this 
category carries the internal image of the antigen to Ab 1 and therefore is commonly 
designated as internal image-type (anti-idiotypic) antibody. Criteria distinguishing an 
internal image-type anti-idiotypic antibody from a "normal", i.e. non internal image-type 
anti-idiotypic antibody, include immunochemical criteria, such as inhibition of binding of 
Ab 2 to Ab 1 by antigen, and functional criteria, e.g. induction of an antigen-specific 
immune response in a mammal which has never before encountered the antigen (H.C.J. 
Ertl and C.A. Bona, supra). Based on its ability to mimic an antigen, an internal image 
antibody is capable of inducing in a variety of systems antigen-specific antibodies, also 
referred to as anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies or Ab 3 (antibody 3). Systems wherein an Ab 3 
response may be engendered are e.g. humans and animal test systems, such as mice and 
goats. Anti-idiotype-based approaches include the use of an idiotype for passive immunotherapy 
of T-cell leukemias or B-cell lymphomas (S. Müller, H. Köhler, D. Anderson in 
Recombinant DNA vaccines: Rationale and Strategy, R.E. Isaacson (ed.), Marcel Dekker, 
New York, 1992, p. 345-346) and the use of an anti-idiotypic monoclonal, e.g. as a 
vaccine to induce immunity to a viral, parasitic or bacterial pathogen, as cancer 
immunotherapeutic agent, as therapeutic agent in immunregulatory disorders and as 
agonistlantagonist in
