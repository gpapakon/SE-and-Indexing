<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic adjusting device for fluid-flow engines (turbo-engines) in which a hydraulic fluid (liquid, medium) which presents no risk to the pumping medium is applied to a rotating joint (connection, seal) which is arranged in the region of the adjusting propeller and is exposed to the pumping (pumped) medium.

<CLAIMS>
Hydraulic adjusting device for controllable pitch 
propellers of fluid-flow machines, transmission elements 

for feeding and discharging and also for conducting a 
hydraulic fluid being arranged in a shaft driving the 

controllable pitch propeller (3), and the hydraulic fluid 
being fed through separate lines (8, 9) from an external 

source via a rotary transmission leadthrough (7) into the 
shaft (1) of the fluid-flow machine, characterized in 

that a space (4) connected to the delivery medium adjoins 
the controllable pitch propeller (3) and accommodates the 

shaft (1), and in that the rotary transmission leadthrough 
(7) for the hydraulic fluid is attached in this 

space (4). 
Use of the adjusting device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the hydraulic fluid used corresponds 

in its composition to the liquid constituent of the 
delivery medium. 
Use of the adjusting device according to Claim 2, 
the hydraulic fluid being water.
