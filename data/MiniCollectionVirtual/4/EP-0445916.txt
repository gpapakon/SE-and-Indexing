<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording 
head and a recording apparatus using 
thermal energy produced by heat 
generating element as in a thermal transfer type or ink 
jet type. In a thermal recording head of a heat-sensitive 
type or a thermal transfer type and an ink 
jet recording head wherein droplets of ink are ejected 
using thermal energy and are deposited on the recording 
medium, the properties of the 
individual heat generating elements of such a recording 
head are not uniform due to the manufacturing variation 
and due to the long term use. This would result in 
non-uniform image density in the recorded image. Therefore, it is known that the properties of 
the heat generating elements are inspected at regular 
intervals or as desired, that in accordance with the 
properties detected, the waveform of driving pulses 
applied is set for the respective heat generating 
elements, by which the quantities of the heat by the 
elements are corrected to avoid the non-uniformity of 
the image density. However, in the known system, the image  
 
signal, that is, the signal indicative of the application 
of the driving pulse or the non-application of the 
driving pulse, that is, formation of a record dot or non-formation 
of the dot on the recording sheet, is used as 
the driving pulse signal. Therefore, in the drive control of the recording 
head, the control of the waveform is carried out for the 
driving pulse for each of the heat generating elements 
at a signal transfer frequency which is required for the 
record image signal. As a result, the circuit structure 
for the waveform control is bulky and costly. Generally, the waveform of the driving pulse is 
represented with plural bits. For example, when the 
pulse width of the waveform is modulated, 16 pulse widths 
can be provided by four bits. Then, where the image 
signal is used as the waveform signal for the driving 
pulse, as described above, and it is transferred at the 
image signal transfer frequency, 4 bit parallel transfer 
is required because of the speed at which the waveform 
control is effected. This results in bulky and 
complicated structures of the recording head because of 
the numerous signal lines in the electric interface. US-A-4574293 discloses an arrangement in which 
electric energy to be applied to each heating element of 
the thermal head is controlled by taking into account the 
energy applied to the heating element one scan period 
before as well as the effect of heat accumulated in  
 
heating elements surrounding
