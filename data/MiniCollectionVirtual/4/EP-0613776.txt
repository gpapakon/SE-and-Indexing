<ABSTRACT>
In a profile (1) for guiding a roller chain (11) for the paper feed in a web-fed rotary printing machine, the object consists in preventing permanent accumulation of a mixture of ink and paper dust in the running path of the profile. According to the invention, this is achieved in that at least one limb has openings (17) which pass through the limb and are spaced apart in the running direction of the roller chain.

<CLAIMS>
A profiled rail, in particular comprising a C-shaped 
profile, having a base body and two mutually parallel limbs (3, 

4; 21, 22) extending at right angles thereto and each having a 
longitudinal groove (14, 16) for receiving and guiding a roller 

chain (11) which is movable in the profiled rail (1, 19) for 
drawing paper into a web-fed rotary printing machine, 

characterized in that at least one limb (3 or 4; 21 or 22) has 
openings (17, 18; 23) which pass through the limb (3, 4; 21, 22) 

and are spaced from one another (a, c) in the direction (B) in 
which the roller chain (11) runs. 
A profiled rail according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the openings (17, 18; 23) comprise slots (17, 18; 23) which pass 

through the entire length (h) of the limb (3, 4; 21, 22) 
extending at a right angle from the base body (2). 
A profiled rail according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the openings (17, 18; 23) comprise slots (17, 18; 23) which pass 

through part (f, g) of the limb (3, 4; 21, 22) extending at a 
right angle from the base body (2). 
A profiled rail according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the openings (17, 18, 23) in the groove (14, 16) receiving the 

rollers (9) of the roller chain (11) are arranged to have a width 
(e) of a running track (7, 8). 
A profiled rail according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the openings (17, 18; 23) pass through a second limb (22 or 21) 

and the base body (2) as far as the first limb (21 or 22). 
A profiled rail according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the slots (17, 18; 23) are arranged at a right angle to 

the longitudinal axis (12, 13) of the groove (14, 16).  
 
A profiled rail according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the slots (17, 18; 23) are arranged obliquely to the 

longitudinal axis (12, 13) of the groove (14, 16). 
A profiled rail according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the openings or slots (17, 18; 23) run in the shape of 

a straight line. 
A profiled rail according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the slots (17, 18; 23) run in a curved shape. 
A profiled rail according to Claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that through bores corresponding to the slots (17, 18; 23) are 

used. 
A profiled rail according to Claims 1 to 10, characterized 
in that the profiled rail (19) has a curved shape with a 

curvature (r, R).
