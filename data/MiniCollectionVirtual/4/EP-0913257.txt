<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an inkjet print cartridge (18) which includes an ink supply (30) and a
substrate (88) having a plurality of individual ink ejection chambers (94) defined by a barrier

layer (104) formed on a first surface of the substrate (88) and having an ink ejection element (96)
in each of the ink ejection chambers (94), for ejecting drops of ink. The ink ejection chambers

(94) arranged in an array spaced so as to provide greater than 500 dots per inch printing. A
nozzle member (79) having a plurality of ink orifices (82) formed therein, is positioned to overlie

the barrier layer (104) with the orifices (82) aligned and associated with the ink ejection
chambers (94). An ink channel connects the supply of ink (31-34) with the inlet channel (132).

A group of the ink ejection chambers (94) in adjacent relationship form a primitive in which a
maximum of only one ejection chamber (94) in the primitive is energized at a time and the

primitive is one of a plurality of primitives on the substrate (88). First circuit means on the
substrate (88) is connected to the ejection elements (96) and second circuit means on the

cartridge are connected to the first circuit means for transmitting ejection signals to the ink
ejection elements (96) at high frequency. The first circuit means applies primitive select signals

to select one or more of the primitives and applies address line select signals to enabling devices
associated with ejection elements (96) in one or more selected primitives such that a maximum

of one ejection chamber (94) in any selected primitive is activated at a time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/960,927,
filed concurrently herewith, entitled "Multi-Drop Merge on Media Printing System";
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/960,928
filed concurrently herewith, entitled "Apparatus for Generating Small Volume, High
Velocity Ink Droplets in an Inkjet Printer" and
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/796,835, filed February 6, 1997, entitled
"Fractional Dot Column Correction for Scan Axis Alignment During Printing," now U.S. Patent No. 5,923,344. The
foregoing commonly assigned patent applications are herein incorporated by reference. The present invention generally relates to inkjet printers and more particularly
to apparatus and methods for generating photographic quality images on a color inkjet
printer.Thermal inkjet hardcopy devices such as printers, large format plotters/printers,
facsimile machines and copiers have gained wide acceptance. These hardcopy devices
are described by W.J. Lloyd and H.T. Taub in "Ink Jet Devices," Chapter 13 of
Output Hardcopy Devices (Ed. R.C. Durbeek and S. Sherr, San Diego: Academic
Press, 1988) and U.S. Patents 4,490,728 and 4,313,684. The basics of this technology
are further disclosed in various articles in several editions of the Hewlett-Packard
Journal [Vol. 36, No. 5 (May 1985), Vol. 39, No. 4 (August 1988), Vol. 39, No. 5
(October 1988), Vol. 43, No. 4 (August 1992), Vol. 43, No. 6 (December 1992) and
Vol. 45, No.1 (February 1994)]. Inkjet hardcopy
devices produce high quality print, are compact and portable, and print quickly and
quietly because only ink strikes the paper.An inkjet printer forms a printed image by printing a pattern of individual dots
at particular locations of an array defined for the printing medium. The locations are 
conveniently visualized as being small dots in a rectilinear array. The locations are
sometimes termed "dot locations", "dot positions", or "pixels". Thus, the printing operation
can be viewed as the filling of a pattern of dot locations with dots of ink.Inkjet hardcopy devices print dots by ejecting very small drops of ink onto the
print medium and typically include a movable carriage that supports one or more
printheads each having ink ejecting nozzles. The carriage traverses over the surface of
the print medium, and the nozzles are controlled to eject drops of ink at appropriate
times pursuant to command of a microcomputer or other controller, wherein the timing
of the application of the ink drops is intended to correspond to the pattern of pixels
