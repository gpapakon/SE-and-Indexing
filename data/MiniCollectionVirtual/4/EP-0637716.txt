<ABSTRACT>
The light drive has a trafficator light zone (B1) which is coloured yellow and an adjacent reversing light zone (B2) which is clear. The trafficator light zone yellow colour extends into the reversing light zone, so that this has alternating yellow and transparent strips (GB,GK). The entire outer surface of the reversing light zone is transparent, the yellow strips lying at the rear of the light disc, each having a prism surface (P) providing diffracted light beams intersecting the light beams passing through the transparent strips.

A light cover lens of a vehicle lamp comprising a plurality of light functions, having 

a first region (B1) constituting the flashing indicator function which has a yellow 
colour, having a second region (B2) which is disposed adjacent to the flashing 

indicator function and which constitutes the reversing light function, and which is 
clear, wherein the yellow colour of the first region (B1) continues in the second, clear 

region (B2) in the form of strips so that clear strips (GK) alternate with yellow strips 
(GB) in the second region (B2) and the yellow strips (GB) consist of the same 

transparent yellow material as the first region (B1) of the cover lens, characterised 
in that the outer face (A) of the cover lens as seen in the direction of the light (L) is 

of clear construction in the whole of the second region (B2) constituting the reversing 
light function, that the yellow strips (GB) are injection-moulded into the clear second 

region (B2) from behind, that the yellow strips (GB) have a light-deflecting prismatic 
lens (P) on their front face as seen in the direction of the light (L), and that the light 

rays (LS) which pass through the yellow strips (GB) intersect the light rays (LS) 
which pass through the clear strips. 
A cover lens according to claim 1, characterised in that the prismatic lens (P) is a 
rear reflector lens which is optically inactive. 
A cover lens according to claim 2, characterised in that the inactive rear reflector lens 
continues in the first region (B1) in the form of strips. 
A cover lens according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the light entry 
faces of the prismatic lens (P) are provided with a dulled finish. 
A cover lens according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that lenses (SL) overlie 
the light entry faces of the prismatic lens (P).  

 
A cover lens according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the light entry faces of the clear strips (GK) are lenses (SL) which scatter light 

vertically or horizontally. 
A cover lens according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the light rays (LS) which are incident on the cover lens have a forward direction 

which is necessary for the generation of the reversing light function. 
A cover lens according to claim 8, characterised in that the forward direction is 
produced by a reflector or an additional cover lens. 
A cover lens according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the yellow strips (GB) have a width which is less than that of the clear strips (GK). 
A cover lens according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterised in that 
the yellow strips (GB) adjacent to the other light functions have a yellow border (R).
