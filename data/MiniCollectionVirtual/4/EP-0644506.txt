<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape printing
apparatus for printing desired characters and symbols onto a
tape to thereby produce a tape label.US-A-5,066,152 has proposed a tape printing apparatus
for printing characters and symbols on a tape (for example,
with a width of 10mm or 24mm). As shown in Fig. 1, the tape
printing apparatus of this document has a keyboard portion
100, a control portion (not shown), a liquid crystal display
portion 101, and a printing mechanism portion 102 integrated
with one another. This tape printing apparatus is suitable
for use in printing file names on a tape which may be used as
a label to be adhesively attached to the back of a file.This conventional tape printing apparatus is that of
an integral type, in which the keyboard portion, the control
portion, the liquid crystal display portion, and the printing
mechanism portion are integrated with one another. The key
board portion is for inputting code data indicative of
characters and symbols desired to be printed on a tape. The
crystal display portion is for displaying the desired
characters and symbols inputted through the operation of the
key board portion. The control portion is for controlling 
the printing mechanism portion, according to the code data,
to print the desired characters and symbols onto the tape.
The printing mechanism portion is provided with a thermal
head. The printing mechanism portion is detachably loaded
with a tape cassette containing the tape that is suitable for
printing the desired characters and symbols. The printing
mechanism portion is controlled by the control portion to
drive the thermal head so as to print the desired characters
and symbols onto the tape contained in the tape cassette.The present inventor has motivated to separate the
print mechanism portion from the keyboard portion, the
control portion and the display portion. Such a separate
type tape printing system can be constructed from a
combination of: a data generating device formed from a
keyboard, a control portion and a display; and a tape
printing device formed from the printing mechanism portion.
The data generating device and the tape printing device may
be connected with a connecting line. According to this
separate type tape printing system, the data generating
device can employ a large display such as a CRT display as
the display portion. It is easy to operate with the large
display. The large display cooperates with the control
portion to enable not only to process the code data of
characters and symbols inputted
