<ABSTRACT>
In a method for bidirectional transmission of data signals between a stationary device (11) and a vehicle device (13), the stationary device (11) emits a signal at a predetermined frequency (fT), the vehicle device (13) transmits the emitted signal back, in particular according to the semi-passive transformer principle, with at least one modulation frequency (f1, f2) and modulated with data, and the stationary device (11) receives the signal which was transmitted back and evaluates it in order to determine the transmitted data. This method permits the determination of the vehicle speed from the communication signals by establishing the relationship between the received modulation frequencies in both sidebands (USB, LSB) and the predetermined frequency (fT) of the originally emitted signal, and by deriving a speed information item for the relevent vehicle (14) from frequency differences of the associated modulation frequencies in the two sidebands (USB, LSB).

Method for the bidirectional transmission of
data signals between a stationary device (11) and a

vehicle device (13), in which the stationary device (11)
sends out a signal of a predetermined frequency (f

vehicle device (13) sends back the signal sent out,

particularly in accordance with the semipassive
transponder principle, modulated with data with at least

one modulation frequency (f

device (11) receives the signal sent back and evaluates

it for determining the transmitted data, characterized
in that the received modulation frequencies in both

sidebands (USB, LSB) are brought into relation with the
predetermined frequency (f

sent out and a speed information for the relevant

vehicle (14) is derived from frequency differences of
the associated modulation frequencies in both sidebands

(USB, LSB).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the received modulation frequencies (f
1

converted down into the baseband and in that a frequency

difference between the down-converted modulation frequencies

Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that pulses from signals in the upper and lower

sideband (USB, LSB) are counted for evaluating the
frequency difference.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in

sideband (USB), a timer (29) is started and when the
predetermined count is reached in the other sideband

response signal which is formed by modulation of the

signal sent out with at least one frequency for
transmitting data, a mixing device (21) and an

evaluating device (22) for determining the transmitted
data, characterized in that, in the mixing device (21),

receiving device (20) are demodulated mixed by using the

predetermined frequency (f
