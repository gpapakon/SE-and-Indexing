<ABSTRACT>
There is described herein a ligating clip applier 
which contains: a handle assembly (20); a jaw assembly 

connected to the handle assembly and containing a shaft 
and a pair of jaws (12). The shaft defines a longitudinal axis 

which lies in a central horizontal plane. A magazine (18) of 
clips (14) is stored on one side of the plane. The jaws are 

positioned so that they are on the opposite side of the 
plane. This configuration allows the clip to be loaded 

into the jaws across the plane, resulting in greater 
visibility of the clips as they are loaded into the jaws. 

Further, there is provided a jaw closure mechanism 
operable in connection with the jaws of this device so 

that the jaws contact the legs of a ligating clip first 
distally and then proximally. Thereafter the jaws are 

parallel at least once during closure, and the closure of 
the clip legs is, indeed, distal and then proximal. This 

improved procedure insures that in virtually all 
instances, the angle included between the clip legs at the 

crown is 0°. Motion of the clip feeding and jaw closing 
mechanisms are accomplished without lost motion, via a 

pair of interengaged mechanisms connected by a single 
tension spring (40) to one another, and
 operating separately 
from the body of the device. This configuration results 

in a more efficient, easier to operate more reliable clip 
applying device.

<DESCRIPTION>
Generally, this invention relates to ligating clip
appliers capable of performing the crushing of the legs of
a metallic ligating clip between the jaws of the device,
in order that the ligating clip may either ligate and
occlude a blood vessel or other lumen, or approximate
tissue.Ligating clip appliers or applicators have become
quite common in the operating room. These appliers are
generally able to engage a ligating clip between a pair of
opposed jaws. Thereafter, the jaws crush the clip by
applying a lateral pressure thereto. The clip is placed
around a blood vessel to occlude or ligate the vessel, or
alternately, the clip may be used to approximate severed
tissue. Clip appliers may engage and clamp a single clip
(and thereafter be reloaded), apply multiple clips
simultaneously, or multiple clips seriatim, from a stack
of clips held in a clip magazine on the clip applier.Certain clip appliers which may be considered
"automatic" are disclosed in the art, and for purposes of
distinguishing with the invention claimed in this
application, are discussed herein. Each of these devices
has a pusher bar (for loading clips) and a camming channel
(for closing clips) which move in opposite directions of
one another, in order to provide more efficient clip 
closure and loading between the jaws. For instance,
Deniega, U.S. Patent No. 4,598,711 presents a clip
applying device wherein a mechanism for loading clips is
moved proximally while a separate mechanism for closing
clips is moved distally, to close a clip between a pair of
jaws. Then, these motions are reversed, in order to load
a new clip between the pair of jaws. But, in Deniega,
there are certain perceived drawbacks. First, the
respective loading and closing mechanisms are operated in
conjunction with a series of links and gears. These
mechanisms require precise interaction of moving members,
and are perceived as relatively cumbersome to operate
properly. Second, a single tension spring controls the
mechanism, to reverse the motion of the loading and
closing operations, but this spring is attached to the
housing of the device. In contrast, it would be desirable
to employ an improved spring system which would not
require special attachment to, or interaction with, the
housing. Such a design could be more easily manufactured.
Further, it would be advantageous to provide such improved
spring system that could be operated more easily, more
quickly, and more reliably.Alternately, another mechanism which functions quite
similarly to the Deniega patent is

<CLAIMS>
An automatic feed ligating clip applier comprising:

a handle assembly (20);
a jaw assembly connected to said handle assembly, and containing a shaft (16)
upon which are mounted a pair of jaws (12), said shaft (16) defining a

longitudinal axis containing a bisecting plane and said jaws (12) defining an axis
placed at an angle transverse to said longitudinal axis; and
a clip magazine (18) containing a plurality of clips (14) capable of being loaded
into said jaws (12), said magazine (18) placed on one side of said plane and said

jaws (12) placed on the opposite side of said plane;
a jaw closure mechanism for closing said jaws (12), said jaw closure
mechanism containing a longitudinally reciprocating bar (106) capable of

moving along a path and feeding a clip (14) between said jaws (12);
said handle assembly (20) including a mechanism for operating said jaw closure
mechanism; and
a lockout mechanism held in place by
the clips (14) stored in said magazine (18);

characterised in that said lockout mechanism
comprises a leaf spring (130),

said leaf spring (130) activated after closing of the last of said clips (14) to move
into said path and across said path, whereby said leaf spring (130) blocks

subsequent movement of said longitudinally reciprocating bar (106).
The applier (10) of claim 1, wherein said jaw closure mechanism (54) causes
said jaws (12) to contact said clip (14) first distally and then proximally, such that said

jaws (12) are parallel during at least one position during closure, and such that said leg
proximal ends contact one another so that the angle included therebetween is

The applier (10) of claim 1 or 2, wherein said jaws (12) angle away from said
first plane at an angle of about 30°. 
The applier (10) of claim 1 or 2, wherein said clip magazine (18) is placed
immediately adjacent said first plane.
The clip applier (10) of claim 2, wherein said jaw closure mechanism (54)
causes said jaw proximal ends to become closer to one another than said jaw distal ends

during at least one position during closure.
The applier (10) of any preceding claim, wherein said lockout mechanism (130)
is a first lockout mechanism and said applier further comprises a second lockout

mechanism (140) connected to said shaft (16) and activated by activation of said first
