<DESCRIPTION>
 ENHANCED IMPLANTATION, DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF EMBRYOS USING LEUKAEMIA INHIBITORY FACTORThe present invention relates to the use of Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) in the enhancement of development and maintenance of animal or mammalian embryos and the use of same to enhance impregnation.LIF is a protein that has previously been cloned, produced and purified in large quantities in recombinant form from both E__coli and yeast cells (International Patent Application No. PCT/AU88/00093). LIF has been defined as a factor, the properties of which include:1. the ability to suppress the proliferation of myeloid leukaemic cells such as Ml cells, with associated differentiation of the leukaemic cells; andthe ability to compete with a molecule having the defined sequence of murine LIF or human LIF (defined in International Patent Application No. PCT/AU88/00093) for binding to specific cellular receptors on Ml cells or murine or human macrophages.A major difficulty associated with present in 301IQ fertilisation (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) programs, particularly in humans, is the low success rate "achieved" on implantation of fertilised embryos. Currently, in human IVF programs, the implantation rate may be as low as 10%, leading to the present practice of using up to four fertilised embryos in each treatment which, in turn, leads occasionally to multiple births. Accordingly, there is a need to improve the implantation rate in human IVF programs. Similarly, in IVF and ET treatments in domestic animals such as sheep, cattle, pigs and goats, it is highly desirable for economic reasons to have as high an implantation rate as possible so as to reduce the numbers of fertilised embryos lost and unsuccessful treatment procedures performed. Furthermore, as with human IVF 

procedures, the practice of transferring more than one embryo to the recipient animal to ensure pregnancy can result in unwanted multiple births.One major constraint with embryo transfer is the need to hold embryos in culture media for either relatively short periods of time, perhaps only a few hours prior to transfer or for longer periods of some days, after micromanipulation.In the development of a mammalian embryo, the fertilised egg passes through a number of stages including the morula and the blastocyst stages. In the blastocyst stage, the cells form an outer cell layer known as the trophectoderm (which is the precursor of the placenta) as well as an inner cell mass (from which the whole of the embryo proper is derived). The blastocyst
