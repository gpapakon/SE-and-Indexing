<ABSTRACT>
To improve quality control a cigarette filter manufacturing line 
is provided with a testing station (28) which periodically removes a 

filter to test the diameter (at 34) and resistance to draw (at 33). 
The mean diameter and RTD of a number of filters is calculated (at 

36) and compared to acceptable ranges. Adjustments are made to the 
manufacturing line to correct any unacceptable values according to a 

set of priorities dependent on the degree and sense of the 
inaccuracies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the control of the manufacture of 
cigarette filters to optimise production quality; more 
particularly it is concerned with the removal of filters from a 
production line, for example for testing. One known quality control system for cigarette filter 
manufacture is sold under the trade mark QUARTET by Filtrona 
Instruments and Automation Limited. This system provides an 
automated statistical analysis of current quality trends which 
enables a machine operator to take whatever corrective action is 
deemed necessary. The system operates by picking up filters from 
the production line, measuring a number of filter parameters for 
each filter, displaying the measured parameters and developing a 
statistical analysis of the filter parameters. The system has a 
disadvantage in that it leaves the corrective action necessary to 
the machine controller to determine and implement. This is both 
slow and prone to inaccuracies. A system for evaluating the condition of rod-shaped articles such 
as cigarettes is known from GB-A-2178293 and a device for removal of filter 
samples from a production line using a vacuum source is known from 
GB-A-2068870, to which latter the preamble of claim 1 corresponds. According to the invention there is provided apparatus for 
conveying cigarette filters from a production line to a remote 
location, comprising a shuttle, 
means for 
rotating the shuttle between a first position in which it can 
receive filters from a reservoir, and a second position in 
which a received filter can be ejected by compressed gas to a tube 
for delivery to the remote location, wherein the 
filters in the second position are orthogonal to the filters in 
the reservoir, characterised in that a hopper is arranged between the 
drum reservoir and the shuttle, the hopper being arranged to 
receive a filter from the drum reservoir holding filters taken off 
the production line, and to guide the filter to the shuttle.  
 A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described 
with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a sketch of the process for manufacture of 
cigarette filters; Figure 2 is a block diagram of a control apparatus for 
control of the production of cigarette filters; Figures 3 and 4 show a filter pick-up device embodying the 
invention;  
 Figures 5 and 6 show, schematically, an RTD gauging head for 
use with the apparatus of Figure 2; and Figure 7 is an exploded view of the gauging head of Figures 
5 and 6. Referring to Figure 1, tow

Apparatus for conveying cigarette filters from a production 
line to a remote location comprising a shuttle (56), 

means (58, 60) for rotating the shuttle 
between a first position in which it can receive filters from a 

reservoir, and a second position in which a received filter can be 
ejected by compressed gas to a tube (66) for delivery to the 

remote location, wherein the filters in the second 
position are orthogonal to the filters in the reservoir, 

characterised in that a hopper (54) is arranged between the drum 
reservoir (52) and the shuttle (56), the hopper (54) being 

arranged to receive a filter (50) ejected from the drum reservoir 
(52) holding filters taken off the production line and to guide 

the filter to the shuttle.
