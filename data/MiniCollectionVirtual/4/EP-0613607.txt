<ABSTRACT>
A superconducting or non-superconducting compact isochronic cyclotron (1) in which the particle beam is sectorally focused. The cyclotron comprises a solenoid forming a magnetic circuit which inlcudes at least 3 pairs of sectors (3 and 3') known as "ridges" where the air gap is reduced, and separated by sector-shaped spaces (4) known as "valleys" where the air gap is larger. Said magnetic circuit is energized by at least one pair of circular main coils (6) surrounding the solenoid poles. Said cyclotron is characterized in that the air gap (8) between two ridges (3 and 3') has a substantially elliptical curved profile which completely closes off the radial end of the ridges (RC) at the centre plane.

Superconducting or non-superconducting compact 
isochronal cyclotron (1) in which the particle beam is 

focused by sectors, comprising an electromagnet comprising 
two poles and constituting the magnetic circuit which 

includes at least three pairs of sectors (3 and 3') 
called "hills" where the air gap is reduced, these being 

separated by spaces in the form of sectors (4) called 
"valleys" where the air gap has a greater dimension and 

which is energized by at least one pair of main circular 
coils (6) surrounding the poles of the electromagnet, 

this cyclotron being characterized in that the air gap 
(8) located between two hills (3 and 3') has an essentially 

elliptical changing profile which tends towards 
complete closure at the radial extremity of the hills, 

called the hill radius (R
c
), on the mid-plane (10). 
Cyclotron according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the air gap (8) between two hills (3 and 3') closes 

up completely at the hill radius (R
c
) on the mid-plane 
(10). 
Cyclotron according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the air gap (8) between two hills (3 and 3') has a 

slight opening, at the hill radius (R
c
), preferably less 
than the vertical dimension of the beam to be extracted. 
Cyclotron according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that a magnetic shunt (9) produced in continuity 

with the poles of the electromagnet is placed 
between each pair of hills (3 and 3') beyond the radial 

extremity (R
c
) of the hills. 
Cyclotron according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that at least one magnetic shunt (9) is equipped with at 

least one opening (11) so as to enable the extracted beam 
to pass. 
Cyclotron accosting to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the magnetic shunts (9) are in the form 

of a metal screen having a thickness lying between 2 and 
10 mm and preferably of the order of 6.5 mm. 
Cyclotron according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the extraction system  

 
associated with the cyclotron is composed of a single 

electrostatic deflector followed by preferably two or 
three focusing electrostatic channels. 
Use of a cyclotron according to any one of the 
preceding claims for accelerating protons to an energy 

greater than 150 MeV.
