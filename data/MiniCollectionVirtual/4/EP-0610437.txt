<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides that where a main underground pipeline or passageway (10) is lined by means of a lining tube which extends over the connection of a lateral pipe (12) with the main pipeline or passageway (10), the said lateral connection can be readily located and the lining tube (44) cut to re-establish the connection, if a means (42), such as a steel ball or a deposit, which is radiation detectable, is placed on the surface of the pipeline or passageway (10) at a predetermined distance (77) from the said lateral connection.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Improvements Relating to- the Lining of Pipelines and PassagewaysThis invention relates to the lining of pipelines and passageways, wherein a lining tube is applied to the pipeline or passageway surface, and on completion of the lining operation remains in this position so as in effect to resurface the passageway. The lining may serve any of a number of functions, for example structurally to enhance the pipeline or passageway, to act as a barrier to liquid ingress or egress in relation to the passageway, to restore the flow characteristics of the passageway and to enhance the pipeline or passageway for carrying an alternative medium, for example to enable a pipeline or passageway to carry a corrosive medium where before its surface was unsuitable for carrying such medium. The lining may of course perform any combination of these functions and there may also be additional functions which it can perform.Many, and probably the majority of these pipelines or passageways, have what are called lateral connections, being connections to spur or Eeeder pipes or passageways which branch from the main pipeline or passageway. In the case of a sewer the lateral connections typically are the individual waste pipe connections to individual homes and other buildings used by the public.One of the problems concerned with the lining of underground pipelines or passageways which have lateral connections, is that when the lining is placed in position, it is not possible, beforehand, to make cut outs which will register with the lateral connections, and it is usual therefore for the lining tube to extend over the lateral connections, and subsequently to cut the tube at locations in register with the lateral connections to re-establisn these connections. This 

 cutting is done by placing in the lined pipeline or passageway a cutting device which is moved so as to register with the lateral connection, and to cut the lining to re-establish the lateral connection.The difficulty which one experiences in the operation is the accurate placement of the cutting apparatus for the location of the lateral connection as it is covered by the lining. It is known to insert a T.V. camera to inspect the pipeline or passageway before lining takes place, to locate and record the positions of the lateral connections, and it is also known to transport an inspection camera through the pipeline or passageway after the lining operation in order visually to examine the lining, because if, as is frequently adopted, the lining is placed in position

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
1. A method of facilitating the locating of a lateral pipe which meets a main pipeline or passageway which has been lined with a lining tube which extends over the lateral pipe/main pipeline or passageway connection, wherein, by means of a suitable apparatus, radiation sensitive means is deposited on the main pipeline or passageway before the lining operation, at a pre-determined distance from the lateral connection, so that following the lining operation, means can be inserted in the lined main pipeline or passageway by which the location of the radiation sensitive means and hence the location of the lateral connection can be radiation sensed.
2. A method according to Claim 1, wherein the radiation sensitive means is light, magnetic, sonic or electric radiation sensitive.
3. A method according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein the radiation sensitive means is positioned on the main pipeline or passageway by locating the edge of the lateral connection using a feeler and the radiation sensitive means is positioned by a positioning arm located at a pre-determined distance from the feeler.
4. A method according to Claim 3, wherein the radiation sensitive means is a deposit of radiation sensitive fluent material.
5. A method according to Claim 4 wherein the positioning arm has a deposit pad and is connected to the feeler by means of a lever arrangement so that when the feeler has detected the edge of the lateral connection, the lever is pivoted 


 which causes the pad to be brought into deposit contact with the pipeline or passageway surface to make the deposit.
6. A method according to Claim 3, wherein the radiation sensitive means is an element of rigid, metallic form.
7. A method according to Claim 6, wherein the element is a small steel ball.
8. A method according to Claim 6 or 7, wherein the element is placed in a hole drilled in the pipeline or passageway surface.
9. A method according to Claim 8, wherein said feeler also comprises a drill bit and after the feeler has located the edge of the lateral connection, it is moved by said pre-determined distance and is used to drill said hole in the passageway surface.
10. A method according to Claim 9, wherein said positioning arm is arranged with said feeler on a rotary head at diametrically opposite positions equi-distant from the axis of of rotation of the head, and the positioning arm inserts the element in said drilled hole after drilling of same and after rotating the head by 180 degrees.
11. A pipeline or passageway to which a radiation sensitive means has been applied in accordance with the method of any one of the preceding Claims.
12. A pipeline or passageway according to Claim 11, after the application of a lining tube thereto.
13. A method according to any of Claims 1 to 10, 


 including the step of lining the main pipeline or passageway with said lining tube.
14. A method according to Claim 13, including the step of locating the lateral connection using a radiation sensor which senses the radiation sensitive means.
15. A method according to Claim 14, including the step of cutting the lining tube to re-establish the connection of the lateral to the main pipeline or passageway.
16. A pipeline or passageway lined according to the method according to any one of Claims 13, 14 and 15.
