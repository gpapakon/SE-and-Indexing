<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus (10) for transferring or deflecting articles (16) for transport stages (40) having conveyors (30, 32, 34), with a disc-shaped basic body (50) which can be arranged level with the conveyors (30, 32, 34) and is rotatable about an axis (52) and which cooperates with at least one pivotable switch (60, 62, 64, 66) codetermining the conveying direction of the articles (16). The apparatus (10) forms the junction point between at least two conveyors (32-38). The switches (60-66) are pivotable in relation to the basic body (50) between a tangential and an approximately radial working position.

Apparatus (10, 11, 13) for charging and discharging, or
respectively deflecting, articles, which apparatus includes a

conveyor path (40, 42, 46) formed by a pair of conveyors (30, 36,
39) which has an advancing conveyor and a returning conveyor, a

disc-like basic body member (50), which is disposable with its
operating area on a level with the conveyors of the pair of

conveyors and is rotatable about an axis, as well as at least one
pivotable guide means (64, 68, 74), which co-determine the

direction of conveyance of the articles, the basic body member
(50) being so shaped that articles from the advancing conveyor can

pass to the rotating basic body member, where they rotate about
the axis until such time as the guide means protrudes substantially

radially into the operating area of the basic body member and
discharges the article, 
characterised in that
 an additional conveyor
(38), or respectively an additional conveyor path formed by an

additional pair of conveyors (32), is provided, this guide means
(64, 68, 74) being associated with the inlet of said conveyor or

path so that the article is discharged onto this additional conveyor,
or respectively additional conveyor path, when the guide means

protrudes into the operating area of the basic body member, and 
in
that
 the article returns to the returning conveyor of the original
conveyor path (40, 42, 46) via the basic body member when the

article is to be transported to no additional conveyor and when the
guide means is therefore in its tangential operating position. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the axis (52,
54, 58) of the basic body member (50) extends parallel to the

pivotal axis (80 to 94) of the guide means (64, 68, 74).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that

the axes (52, 54, 58) extend vertically and are spaced from one
another, the pivotal axes (84, 88, 94) being disposed externally of

the basic body member (50).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that

the axis (52, 54, 58) of the basic body member (50) intersects the
central axis (100 to 106, 114) of at least one conveyor path (40, 42,

46) or is disposed centrally between two conveyors.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that

the diameter of the basic body member (50) corresponds to at least
the width of the conveyor path (40, 42, 46).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that

the number of guide means (60 to 70, 74) corresponds
substantially to the number of pairs of conveyors forming the

conveyor paths.
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that

the side (122) of the guide means (68, 74) facing the basic body
member (50), when viewed with respect to the tangential position

of the guide means (68, 74), is arcuate. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that

the radius of curvature of the guide means (68, 74) corresponds to
the radius of curvature of the basic body member (50).
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that

the sides (130) of the guide means (68) remote from the basic body
member (50), when viewed with respect to the tangential position

of the guide means, are substantially rectilinear.
