<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel polypeptides having potent
gastrointestinal motor inhibitory activity useful in the treatment of conditions
characterized by elevated plasma motilin levels such as infectious diarrhea and
Crohn's disease.Motilin is a gastrointestinal linear polypeptide hormone which stimulates the
gastric antrum, duodenum, and colon. Although its effects are not completely
known, motilin plays a role in increasing gastric motility and stimulating pepsin
output and may also be important in regulating the interdigestive myoelectric
complex. Human motilin has not yet been purified, but its immunologic properties
strongly suggest that it is very similar to porcine motilin. Porcine motilin contains
22 amino acid residues and may be represented by the formula:
Porcine motilin has a hydrophobic region from positions 1 to 5, a
hydrophilic region from positions 11 to 22, and a connecting region from positions
6 to 10. Porcine motilin also has an α-helical secondary structure from residues 9
to 20 of the primary sequence [Khan et al., Biochemistry29, 5743-5751 (1990)].Administration of motilin to healthy human subjects accelerates
intestinal transit time and enhances gastric emptying. In vitro, motilin stimulates
contractions of human and rabbit duodenal smooth muscle strips and isolated
gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells. In addition, motilin and some of its
derivatives compete with radiolabelled motilin for binding sites on human and
rabbit antral tissue suggesting that stimulation of specific receptors in the
gastrointestinal tract is responsible for the physiological effects of the hormone.
Infusion of motilin has been reported to stimulate the emptying of solids and liquids
in patients with diabetic gastroparesis [Peeters et al., Gastroenterology100, A480
(1991)]. In addition, motilin has been used to treat patients with paralytic ileus
caused by carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract [Meyer et aL., Med. Klin. 86, 515-517
(1991)]. Motilin has a relatively short half-life (t½) of 4.5 minutes in humans,
Christofides et al., Gastroenterology76, 903-907 (1979), which makes it necessary
to administer the hormone by continuous infusion to induce a therapeutic effect.The N-terminal amino acid sequence and certain residues of the mid-portion
of motilin are essential for contractile activity, [Macielag et al., Peptides13, 565-569 (1992); Peeters et al., Peptides13, 1103-1107 (1992); Poitras et al.,
Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 183, 36-40 (1992)]. Motilin-like polypeptides
