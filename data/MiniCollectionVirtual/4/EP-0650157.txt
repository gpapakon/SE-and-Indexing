<ABSTRACT>
A disklike magnetic recording medium having a magnetic layer containing a magnetic substance on a non-magnetic 
support, 

and a layer containing a pigment whose optical characteristics are changed by the irradiation of energy beam and interposed 
between the non-magnetic support and the magnetic layer. A continuous servo signal is recorded on the concentric tracks on the 

pigment-containing layer in accordance with variation of the optical characteristics of the pigment. This medium can be manufactured 
at a low cost, and has a large recordable area. Accurate tracking can be done by a single detector.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording
medium suitable for tracking by an optical means and a
recording/reproducing method therefor as well as an
information processing apparatus by means thereof.Floppy disk devices are used in a large quantity for
information recording of e.g. computers or
wordprocessors. Usual floppy disk devices had a problem
that since positioning of the head is conducted by an
open loop control using a step motor (control without
feedback), positioning precision is poor, and it is
impossible to increase the track density.In recent years, it has been proposed to provide
grooves on a magnetic recording medium and monitoring the
position of the head by reading the groove position by an
optical sensor provided integrally with the head.
According to this method, positioning of the head is
conducted by a closed loop control (feedback control),
whereby positioning precision can be improved, and it is
possible to realize a track density higher by one figure
than the conventional devices. One example of a floppy disk utilizing this principle
is shown in Figures 11 and 12. Reference numeral 19
indicates a floppy disk, and Figure 12 is an enlarged
view of a part of the magnetic recording medium 4 of
Figure 11. Figure 14 is a cross-sectional view vertical
to the medium plane, illustrating a servo-signal reading
system of an optical track servo-mechanism. On the
surface of the magnetic recording medium 4, numerous pits
5 are formed in accordance with a track pitch. Through
an aperture formed in the center of a head 6, a light
from a light-emitting element 8 is projected on the
surface of the magnetic recording medium 4. Tracking is
carried out by reading a reflected light thereof by a
light receptor 10 via an optical system 9.An optical detector and a tracking error detecting
circuit used for this purpose are shown in Figures 13 and
15, respectively. In the following description, P
represents a track pitch.The light receptor 10 is composed of four unit
elements arranged in a square lattice pattern and upon
receiving the above-mentioned reflected light, outputs
four signals A to D. When the head is located at the
track position (radius R), signal B is deducted from
signal A by a differential amplifier 11 to obtain a
signal proportional to cos(2πR/P)Likewise, signal D is
deducted from signal C by a differential amplifier 12 to
obtain a signal proportional to sin(2πR/P). On the other 
hand, binary codes for target value T are input to
address terminals of ROM 13 and 14 in which a
