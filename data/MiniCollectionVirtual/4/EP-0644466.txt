<ABSTRACT>
A patch image is formed on the photoreceptor under a patch 
image forming condition which is different from a recording 

image forming condition. The recording image forming condition 
is controlled by adjusting at least one of a charging device, 

a developing device and an electric bias in accordance with 
the density of the patch image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus for controlling image forming conditions by a
density signal which is obtained by detecting a patch image.
More particularly, the present invention relates to the
control of image forming conditions at the time of color image
formation.In an image forming apparatus, the apparatus is provided
with developing units in which developers are accommodated. A
toner image is formed on an image carrier when reversal
development etc. are conducted by the developing units. Then,
the toner image is transferred onto a recording material and
an image is recorded.When a color image is formed, the apparatus is provided
with four developing units in which each of yellow (Y),
magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (BK) developers are
accommodated. When a mono-color toner image formed by the
reversal development of each developing unit is superimposed 
on the image carrier, a color toner image is formed. This
color toner image is transferred onto the recording material
and a color image is recorded.In this case, it greatly affects the quality of the image
whether the image density of the image recorded on the image
carrier is stably maintained or not in the case where a large
number of sheets are copied.Further, at the time of the color image formation, the
color image is formed by superimposing a plurality of mono-color
toner images. Accordingly, the reproducibility etc. of
the color image are largely affected due to whether each mono-color
toner image is developed into an image having well-balanced
image density. Specifically, it is difficult to
stabilize the secondary colors (red(R), green (G), and blue
(B), etc.) which are made by superimposing the primary colors
of Y, M and C.Therefore, the image forming apparatus is provided with a
control means for controlling the image density of the toner
image.As a control means for the image density of the toner
image, the following means are widely known. First, a means
in which a tablet-shaped patch image having a standard density
corresponding to the toner image is formed on the image
carrier, and image forming conditions are controlled by a
density signal obtained by detecting the patch image (Japanese
Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection No. 
106,672/1988). Next, a means for controlling the number of
revolution of the developing sleeve of the developing unit
corresponding to the humidity in the apparatus (Japanese
Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection No.
186,368/1990).An optical detection means composed
