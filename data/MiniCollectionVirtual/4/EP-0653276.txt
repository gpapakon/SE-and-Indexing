<ABSTRACT>
Device for moving a scraper (1) in relation to a roll (3), to be stripped by the scraper, of a roll mill having at least two rolls, in particular on roll mills for the ceramic preparation of clays or similar compounds, between an operating position and a maintenance position, the scraper being pivoted by a drive arrangement (11) having a pivoting drive out of the operating position about a fixed pivot spindle (13), parallel to the axis of rotation of the roll, to an easily accessible maintenance position, away from the roll nip.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for moving two scrapers (1), each of 
which is associated with one of two rolls (3, 3) of a 

roll jaw crusher, more particularly for preparing 
ceramic materials, each scraper (11) being pivotable, 

by means of its own pivoting drive (11, 14), out of an 

operating position (8) in which it scrapes the 
associated roll, about a fixed pivot axis (7) parallel 

to the axis of rotation of the roll (3), into a readily 
accessible standby position (9) remote from the roll 

gap, characterised in that each pivoting drive (11, 14) 
comprises two drive elements, namely one pivoting drive 

element (11) pivotally connected to the associated 
scraper (1), and an auxiliary drive element (14) 

pivotally connected to the pivoting drive element (11). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised by a 
control for the two pivoting drives for pivoting the 

two scrapers (1) either independently of one another or 
simultaneously and in the same way. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the lines of action of each pivoting drive 

element (11) and of each auxiliary drive element (14) 
extend in pairs substantially perpendicularly to one 

another and perpendicularly to the pivot axes (7). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the drive elements (11, 

14) are hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that an articulation (13) of  

 
the pivoting drive (11, 14) on the associated scraper 

(1) is situated axially outside the length of the 
scraper (1). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that each scraper (1) 

comprises a scraper tool (5) extending parallel to the 
axis of rotation of the rolls (3), said scraper tool 

being held at each of its opposite ends by a scraper 
arm (4) mounted on the pivot (7). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that drive elements (11, 14) 

coupled to one another are provided axially on either 
side of each scraper (1). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the auxiliary drive 

element (14) is articulated on a point of the pivoting 
drive element (11) situated between the articulation 

(13) and a stationary supporting point (12) of the 
pivoting drive element (11). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the pivoting drive 

elements (11) are disposed symmetrically to the plane 
of symmetry of the pair of rolls (3, 3). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a common auxiliary drive 

element (14) is provided for both scrapers (1) and is 
connected at its opposite ends to the two pivoting 

drive elements (11).
