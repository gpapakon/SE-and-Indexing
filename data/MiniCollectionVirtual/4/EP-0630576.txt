<ABSTRACT>
Animal feed comprises: a) a basic feed; and b) a mixt. of 30-95 wt. % of 1 or more collagen hydrolysates and 70-5 wt. % of 1 or more oligofructoses. Mixt. b) pref. has 75-95 wt. % collagen hydrolysate content and 25-5 wt. % oligofructose content. High purity, neutral-tasting hydrolysed protein from connective tissue is used. Oligofructose is composed of 2 or more, pref. up to 9, fructose units linked beta(1-2)-wise and having fructose or glucose as the terminal unit. The basic feed is pref. zero or as low as possible content of egg yolk, lactose, wheat gluten, purine contg. materials and yeast.

<CLAIMS>
An animal feed of drinkable or chewable
consistency, consisting of a base substance

conventional in animal feeds and characterised by an
additional content, added to the base substance, which

is a mixture of one or more collagen hydrolysates and
oligofructoses, the content of collagen hydrolysates

being in the range from 30 to 95% by weight and the
content of oligofructoses in the range from 70 to 5% by

weight in the additional content.
An animal feed according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the content of collagen hydrolysates is in the

range from 75 to 95% by weight and the content of
oligofructoses in the range from 25 to 5% by weight in

the added mixture.
An animal feed according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the collagen hydrolysates are

highly purified, neutral-tasting hydrolyzed proteins
from connective tissue.
An animal feed according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the molecules of the

oligofructoses consist of two or more, preferably a
maximum of nine, fructose molecular units which are

Î²(1-2) bonded, the terminal molecular unit being a
fructose or glucose molecular unit.
An animal drink according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the above mixture is

dissolved in drinking water in a proportion of 5 to 60%
by weight. 
An animal drink according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that vegetable oil(s) having a

high content of unsaturated fatty acids are added to
the animal drink in a proportion of 1 - 5% by weight.
A chewable animal feed according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that a proportion of

5 to 85% by weight of the above mixture is added to
existing animal fodder.
A chewable animal feed according to Claim 7,
characterised in that the prepared animal feed has a

moisture content of 5 to 35% by weight.
