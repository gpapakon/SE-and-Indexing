<ABSTRACT>
A distributed amplifier (100) comprises an input side 
circuit (100a) including a plurality of distributed constant 

lines (3a,3b,3c) connected in series between an input 
terminal (1) and ground and a plurality of source-grounded 

FETs (11a,11b) for switching operation having drains 
connected to junctions between the distributed constant 

lines (3a,3b,3c), an output side circuit (100b) including a 
plurality of distributed constant lines (3d,3e,3f) connected 

in series between an output terminal (2) and ground, and a 
plurality of source-grounded amplifier FETs (7a,7b) having 

gates connected to junctions between the distributed 
constant lines (3a,3b,3c) of the input side circuit (100a) 

via capacitors (9a) and drains connected to junctions of the 
distributed constant lines (3d,3e,3f) of the output side 

circuit (100b). In this structure, since the input side 
circuit (100a) also serves as a distributed switch, when a 

T/R module is fabricated using the distributed amplifier, it 
is not necessary to add a distributed switch for controlling 

signal input and output, so that the chip size of the T/R 
module is reduced compared to the conventional T/R module. 

In addition, the signal transmission loss is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a distributed 
amplifier and a bidirectional amplifier including the 
distributed amplifier. Figure 7 is a circuit diagram illustrating a structure 
of a prior art distributed amplifier. In figure 7, a 
distributed amplifier 700 comprises an input side circuit 
70a disposed between an input terminal and ground, an output 
side circuit 70b disposed between an output terminal 2 and 
ground, and source-grounded FETs 70c and 70d disposed 
between the input circuit 70a and the output circuit 70b. 
The input side circuit 70a comprises three distributed 
constant lines 3a to 3c, a terminal resistor 8 of 50 Ω, and 
a bypass capacitor 9 which are connected in series between 
the input terminal 1 and ground. The output side circuit 
70b comprises three distributed constant lines 3d to 3f, a 
terminal resistor 8 of 50 Ω, and a bypass capacitor 9 which 
are connected in series between the output terminal 2 and 
ground. The source-grounded FET 70c includes a gate 
connected to the junction of the input side distributed 
constant lines 3a and 3b and a drain connected to the 
junction of the output side distributed constant lines 3e 
and 3f via a distributed constant line 10. The source-grounded  
 
FET 70c includes a gate connected to the junction 
of the input side distributed constant lines 3b and 3c and a 
drain connected to the junction of the output side 
distributed constant lines 3d and 3e via a distributed 
constant line 10. Each of the source-grounded FETs 70c and 70d is 
illustrated as an equivalent circuit comprising a gate-to-source 
capacitance 4, a current supply 5 controlled by a 
gate bias voltage, and a drain-to-source capacitance 6. In the distributed amplifier 700, if the distributed 
constant lines 3a to 3c of the input side circuit 70a on the 
gate side of the source-grounded FET 70c (70d) is regarded 
as an inductance (Lg), the gate-source capacitance (Cgs) 4 
of the FET and the inductance (Lg) form a circuit equivalent 
to a distributed constant line on the gate side of the FET. 
Similarly, if the distributed constant line 10 connected to 
the drain of the source-grounded FET 70c (70d) is regarded 
as an inductance (Ld), the drain-source capacitance (Cds) 6 
of the FET and the inductance (Ld) form a circuit equivalent 
to a distributed constant line on the drain side of the FET. A description is given of the operation. Assuming that the input or output side characteristic 
impedance be Zo, the following equation (3) is achieved on 
the gate side of the
