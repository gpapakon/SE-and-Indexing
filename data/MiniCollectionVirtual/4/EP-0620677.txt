<ABSTRACT>
A halftone screen and method in which the processing order of 
unprocessed image pixels of a continuous tone image is performed 

according to a randomized, space-filling, two-dimensional curve. 
The randomized, space-filling, two-dimensional curve can be a 

fractal curve. 
The curve can have different tone dependencies. The halftoning 

processing can involve an error diffusion algorithm.

<DESCRIPTION>
A number of reproduction methods are only capable of reproducing 
a small number of image tones. For example, offset printing or 
electrophotographic printing methods are only capable of printing 
two tone values i.e. deposit ink or toner or not. In order to 
reproduce images having continuous tones, a halftoning or screening 
technique is used. A halftoning technique converts a density value into a geometric 
distribution of binary dots that can be printed. The eye is not 
capable of seeing the individual halftone dots, and only sees the 
corresponding "spatially integrated" density value. Two main classes of halftoning techniques have been described 
for use in the graphic arts field. These two techniques are known 
as "amplitude modulation screening" and "frequency modulation 
screening". According to amplitude modulation screening, the halftone dots, 
that together give the impression of a particular tone, are arranged 
on a fixed geometric grid. By varying the size of the halftone dots 
the different tones of an image can be simulated. Consequently this 
technique can also be called "dot size modulation screening". According to frequency modulation screening, the distance 
between the halftone dots is modulated rather than their size. This 
technique, although well known in the field of low resolution plain 
paper printers, has not obtained much attention for offset printing 
and other high end printing methods, probably because of the 
disadvantages to be discussed further on. Both classes of halftone techniques are used in combination with 
a digital film recorder. A typical digital film recorder consists 
of a scanning laser beam exposing a photosensitive material at high 
resolution. The "grid" that defines the resolution at which the 
laser beam can be switched ON or OFF, usually has a pitch in the 
range of 1/1800 of an inch. The photosensitive material can be a 
photographic film, from which later on a printing plate is prepared 
by means of photomechanical techniques. The smallest addressable  
 
unit on a recorder is often called a "micro dot", "recorder 
element", or "rel". The two classes of halftoning techniques, each with some of 
their variants, will now be reviewed, and their advantages and 
disadvantages will be discussed. The most important characteristics 
of a screening or halftoning technique for faithfully reproducing a 
continuous tone image include : 
1) The rendering characteristics, more specifically the ability to 
render spatial detail in the original image content
