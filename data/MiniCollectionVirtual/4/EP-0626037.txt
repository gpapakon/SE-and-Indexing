<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling the mass of air and fuel delivered to an internal combustion engine per cylinder per cycle by first determining the required fuel per cycle for the existing engine operating conditions, and then setting the air supply to the engine to provide the required air/fuel ratio for the determined fuel per cycle requirement. Thereafter, determining the actual air supply to the engine, and adjusting the fuel per cycle so the actual air/fuel ratio is greater or less than predetermined limits of the required air/fuel ratio. A look-up map can be provided in an electronic engine management system with preset air/fuel ratios against engine speed and load. The map is arranged with the predetermined limits of the required air/fuel ratio selected to prevent a specific condition such as engine misfire or for catalyst and/or emission considerations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the controlling of the air/fuel ratio of the
combustion mixture for a fuel injected intemal combustion engine. In the
specification, the reference to air/fuel ratio is in relation to the overall air/fuel ratio
for each engine cycle and does not refer to air/fuel ratio at any particular location
within the combustion chamber of the engine.Conventional homogenous charge intemal combustion engines normally
utilise an air/fuel delivery system in which the amount of air flowing to the engine
is controlled by the operator and the amount of air-flow in tum determines the
amount of fuel to be delivered to the engine. Thus the amount of air flowing to the
engine directly determines the power output of the engine. This is true for both
carburetted and fuel injected systems. For example, with a typical fuel injected
system an air-flow meter is employed to determine the amount of air flowing to the
engine. The fuel to be injected to the engine is then determined by reference to,
inter alia, the measured air-flow.However, with recent developments in intemal combustion engine
technology there is a tendency to stratify the air/fuel mixture within the
combustion chamber. This is particularly true of some two-stroke cycle engines.
When a stratified charge mixture is utilised there will be an excess of air within
the combustion chamber which will not be involved in the combustion process.
Thus the total amount of air flowing to the engine is, in general, not directly
related to the engine power output as is the case for a homogenous charge
engine. In such a case it is desirable to de-couple the fuel flow to the engine from
the air flow to the engine so that the air and fuel flows can be independently
controlled. One such method of achieving this de-coupling is described in
European Patent Application No 0 239 095 (compare with the features of claim 1, first part). In the method described in EP-A-0
239 095 the fuel supplied to the engine is determined in accordance with engine 
operating conditions, and the engine air supply is controlled to achieve a desired
air/fuel ratio. To attempt to reduce harmful emissions air/fuel ratios between 15
and 18 are avoided.Another method of de-coupling is known as a Drive-By-Wire (DBW)
system with engine fuel control. In a conventional DBW system the operator
does not directly control the air or the fuel but merely generates a signal
("demand" signal) which indicates the operators requirements (e.g. increase or
decrease in power output from the engine). This

<CLAIMS>
A method of controlling the mass of air and fuel delivered to an intemal
combustion engine per cylinder per cycle comprising:


determining a required amount of fuel per cycle for delivery to the
engine in response to engine operating conditions;
setting the air supply to the engine to provide a required air/fuel ratio for
the required amount of fuel per cycle at said operating conditions; and
determining a value for the actual air supply to the engine by measuring

the air flow at a position within the engine system;

   characterised in that the required amount of fuel delivered to the engine
is corrected if a secondary air/fuel ratio, based on the measured air flow

and the required amount of fuel, is outside predetermined limits of the
required air/fuel ratio.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the required amount of air per
cycle is determined in response to said required amount of fuel per cycle and

engine operating conditions, the air flow to the engine is adjusted in response to
said required amount of air per cycle and it is determined whether the measure

air flow to the engine is within set limits of said required air flow and, if not,
correcting said required amount of fuel per cycle.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the method is
implemented by an electronic engine management system programmed with a

look-up map having pre-set required air/fuel ratios for given engine speed and 
load conditions.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein said
predetermined limits of the required air/fuel ratio are set to prevent a specific

engine malfunction.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein said
predetermined limits of the required air/fuel ratio are set to avoid differing engine

malfunction throughout the operating range of the engine.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein a
specific look-up map is provided for wide open throttle.
A method as claimed in claim 6, wherein said specific look-up map is
selected by an input signal responsive to wide open throttle.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 7, wherein the air supply
to the engine which is adjusted to provide the required air/fuel ratio is a by-pass

air supply.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the required
air/fuel ratio is adjusted in accordance with a condition selected from the group

consisting of high-altitude engine operation and filter blockage.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein a fuel
per cycle map is provided which is adapted to be reset in response to continued

sensed changes in an engine operating condition.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
required values of said air/fuel ratio are adaptive over time.
