An antifouling paint composition containing, as a 
vehicle component, a resin obtained by grafting a 

hydrolyzable polyester (A) having (a) an oxyacid and/or 
its condensate, (b) a polybasic carboxylic acid 

containing no hydroxyl group and/or its acid anhydride 
and (c) a polyhydric alcohol reacted so that the 

equivalent ratio of the total hydroxyl groups in (a) and 
(c) to the total carboxyl groups in (a) and (b) is from 

1/0.9 to 1/1.1, to a vinyl copolymer (B') containing, as 
a constituting component, at least 10 mol% of a 

polymerizable unsaturated monomer having a functional 
group reactive with a hydroxyl group in (A), said resin 

having free carboxyl groups blocked by a blocking agent 
so that the acid value is not higher than 20.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antifouling paint
composition containing, as a vehicle component, a resin
having a polyester hydrolyzable in sea water grafted to a
vinyl copolymer through or without through a polybasic
carboxylic acid and/or its acid anhydride.Various marine-organisms settle on the surface of
exterior plates at the bottoms of ships, marine
structures or fishing nets located below the sea water
surface. This creates problems such that in the case of
ships, efficient operation will thereby be hindered, and
in the case of marine structures or fishing nets, the
useful life will thereby be substantially shortened. As
a measure to cope with such problems, it is common to
employ underwater antifouling paints containing various
antifouling agents.Typical conventional antifouling paints include, for
example, an insoluble matrix type antifouling paint
having an antifouling agent incorporated to a vehicle
component comprising a resin such as a vinyl resin, an 
alkyd resin or chlorinated rubber, which is insoluble in
sea water and rosin which is soluble in sea water, and a
soluble matrix type antifouling paint containing, as a
vehicle component, a copolymer comprising, as a
constituting component, a triorganotin-containing monomer
which gradually undergoes hydrolysis in sea water, and
having an antifouling agent incorporated, as the case
requires.However, with the insoluble matrix type antifouling
paint which is designed to provide antifouling effects by
dissolution of the antifouling agent together with rosin
in sea water, constant antifouling effects for a long
period of time can not be expected. Besides, after
dissolution of rosin and the antifouling agent, the resin
component insoluble in sea water will remain as a coating
film and will form a skeleton structure. Thus, it has a
drawback that especially when it is used for ships, the
frictional resistance of the coated surface with the sea
water increases to reduce the speed or to increase the
costs for the fuel. On the other hand, the above-mentioned
soluble matrix type antifouling paint has
problems from the viewpoint of hygienic safety and
protection of environment, although it has adequate
antifouling effects.Further, as an intermediate type between the above-mentioned
two paints, an antifouling paint has recently
been developed which contains, as vehicle components, a 
hydrolyzable polyester resin and a water-insoluble resin
without using an organotin-containing resin (Japanese
