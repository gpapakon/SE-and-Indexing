<ABSTRACT>
A fat-cleaving lipase is used for the enzymatic degradation of resin 
in chemithermomechanical fluff-pulp (CTMP-fluff) by hydrolysis of the 

triglycerides present in the resin to fatty acids readily washable from 
the pulp, with the intention of improving the liquid absorbency of the 

fluff pulp when forming from said pulp such sanitary articles as soft 
paper, disposable diapers or the like. The lipase is supplied either:

or to chips intended for a CTMP-process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chemithermomechanical pulp
(CTMP) for the manufacture of sanitary articles, a method of manufacturing
CTMP suitable for the manufacture of sanitary articles, the use of a fat-cleaving
lipase for the enzymatic degradation of resin in CTMP, and sanitary articles.It is known that some types of cellulose pulp made from wood have a
high resin content, e.g. various types of mechanical pulp and pulp made by a
sulphite process.Mechanical pulping, alone or combined with a gentle chemical
treatment, is widely used in the manufacture of pulps. Thus, chemithermomechanical
pulps (CTMP) are produced by refining chemically pre-treated chips with yields of
85-95%. This chemical pre-treatment normally comprises impregnating the chips with
an alkaline sulphite solution. The chips, thus impregnated with chemicals, are heated
to temperatures above 100°C and thereafter refined under pressure. The pulp is then
normally screened and bleached. Bleaching is most often effected with hydrogen
peroxide in an alkaline environment. One use for CTMP is found in the manufacture
of sanitary articles, such as disposable diapers and similar absorption products. The
processes used for producing mechanical pulp (such as CTMP) occur at pH in the
range 4-9, and the components of the wood undergo relatively small chemical
changes; the pulp therefore has a considerable content of resin.The resin can create disturbances in the process of pulp manufacture
and may also have a negative effect on the properties of the final pulp product. The
ability of fluff-pulp to absorb aqueous liquids is of particular importance, The rate at
which absorption takes place is also of particular significance. Since fat has a water-repelling 
nature, a high fat content will have a negative effect on the absorption rate.
Further, agglomerated resin may cause paper breakage during paper manufacture
or during printing.Resin of wood material is soluble in organic solvents and, to a large
extent, is comprised of hydrophobic components. It is known that the hydrophobic
part of resin contains considerable amounts of triglycerides, more commonly known
as fats, and other esters. The triglycerides play a large part in rendering the resin
hydrophobic, therewith making it less possible to wash the resin from the pulp. It
would be desirable to hydrolyse these as the hydrolysis products are more easily
removed in aqueous systems.Triglyceride hydrolysis can be achieved by treating the wood with a
strongly alkaline liquid, similar to what takes

<CLAIMS>
A chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP) for the manufacture
of sanitary articles, such as soft paper and disposable diapers, having improved

liquid absorbency, characterized in that the proportion of triglycerides in the pulp
resin has been reduced by enzymatic hydrolysis of the triglycerides with the aid of

a fat-cleaving enzyme, a lipase, such as to form free fatty acids which can be readily
washed from the pulp, said lipase-treatment being carried out either:


on wood chips prior to pulp manufacture, by treating the chips with a dilute
lipase solution in a quantity corresponding to 15-30 KLU/kg of absolutely dry

chips, preferably about 25 KLU/kg chips, and subsequently maintaining the
chips at a t
emperature of 30-50°C, preferably at about 40°C, over a time
period from 10 hours to 1 calendar day, or
during pulp bleaching or on bleached or unbleached CTMP-fluff at a
temperature within the range of 20-80°C, preferably 30-60°C, and at a pulp

consistency of beneath 60% by weight and a pulp pH within the range of 3-12,
preferably 7-10.
A method of manufacturing CTMP suitable for the manufacture of
sanitary articles, such as soft paper and disposable papers, having liquid

absorbency, by refining chemically pretreated wood chips, optionally screening,
washing and bleaching the thus produced pulp, followed by flash drying the pulp,

characterized by adding to wet CTMP during pulp bleaching or on bleached or
unbleached CTMP or to chips intended for a CTMP-process a fat-cleaving enzyme,

a lipase, such as to degrade triglycerides present in resin, by enzymatic hydrolysis
of said triglycerides to fatty acids capable of being readily washed from the pulp,

said lipase-treatment being carried out either: 

on wood chips prior to pulp manufacture, by treating the chips with a dilute
lipase solution in a quantity corresponding to 15-30 KLU/kg of absolutely dry

chips, preferably about 25 KLU/kg chips, and subsequently maintaining the

instance, of a tower or a pulp chest, preferably in the form of an aqueous
preparation of the lipase, said lipase having been supplied to the pulp as a thinner

container for a period of up to one calendar day, preferably for a period of 10-20

hours, at a pH of 9-9.5, and thereafter having been further treated in a following
stage, e.g. a flash dryer, in a manner known per se.
