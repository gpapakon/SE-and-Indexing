<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for transferring filter rods into a pneumatic conveying line by means of a troughed drum which removes the filter rods from a stock, transversely to their axis, and terminates with a lengthwise axis in the enclosing region of the sealing block. The object is to reduce the wear on such a device and to improve its performance. This is achieved by means of a troughed drum (1) which is mounted free of contact with respect to adjoining circumferential and end surfaces (17 and 19 respectively) and maintaining a play or gap (25 and 31 respectively). This arrangement lengthens the service life of the adjoining sealing block and, by means of a defined, permanent by-pass air-flow, achieves an increased selection frequency of the filter rods.

Device for transferring tube-shaped articles of the
tabacco processing industry, in particular filter tubes, from a

store into a pneumatic conveying line, having a rotatable
conveying drum provided with receiving cavities, the receiving

cavities of which drum communicate, on the drum circumference,
in a feeding zone B in an axially transverse manner with a

storage container and, at the front end of the drum, in a
delivery zone C in an axially longitudinal manner with the

stationary conveying line, and also having a sealing block which
can be lowered and which embraces the conveying drum in the

delivery zone C in a stationary manner in the form of an arc of
a circle, characterized in that the conveying drum (1) with its

rotatably moved external drum surface is arranged without making
contact relative to the counter-surfaces (18, 19) arranged

adjacent in a stationary manner in the delivery zone C.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that
coaxial, stationary, support bushes (19, 21) through which the

drum axis (7) mounted without play passes are associated with the
conveying drum (1) at its end faces, the circumferential surface

of which support bushes, matching the radius of the sealing
surface (18) of the sealing block (17), has a diameter which is

slightly greater than the drum diameter of the conveying drum
(1).
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized by two
pressure pistons (39) engaging with the sealing block (17)

radially and centrally relative to the support bushes (19, 21).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the
pressure pistons (39) pass through a carrier body (28) which is

formed as a supply plate and which accommodates the sealing block
(17) in the region of the compressed-air supply with the 

intervening arrangement of a resilient seal (37) and, together
with said carrier body (28), form a friction-type connection (42)

in the radial approach direction of the sealing block.
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in that the
friction-type connection (42) between the pressure pistons (39)

and the carrier body (28) has a defined degree of play.
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 5, characterized
in that the support bushes (19, 21) are rigidly connected via

tie-bars (24) to a fixed assembly plate (26) to which the drives
of the pressure pistons (39), which are formed as compressed-air

cylinders (29), are secured.
Device according to one of Claims 4 to 6, characterized
in that the carrier body (28) has parallel guides (27) which are

arranged on the assembly plate (26).
Device according to one of Claims 3 to 7, characterized
by a vertical alignment or working direction of the parallel

guides (27) or the pressure pistons (39).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterized
in that a centring pin connection (43) is provided between the

sealing block (17) and the carrier body (28).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized
in that a guiding ramp (48) rising in the transfer direction

(arrow 47) of the filter tubes (3) relative to the sealing
surface of the support bush (19) is provided on the guiding

surface of the sealing block (17), adjacent to the conveying line
section (46) of the pneumatic conveying line (16) extending in

the region of the support bush.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that a discharge bevel (50) inclined downwards

towards the front face of the sealing block (17) is provided at 
one end on the flank (49) of the sealing block, located on the

discharge side, relative to the direction of rotation (13) of the
conveying drum (1).
