<ABSTRACT>
The addition of an amine functional poly(vinyl alcohol) in a process 
for making recycled paper products results in improvements in both the wet 

and dry strength of the resultant products. The amine functional 
poly(vinyl alcohol) used in the process is formed by the hydrolysis of 

vinyl acetate/vinyl amide copolymers or vinyl acetate/allyl amine 
copolymers, or optionally may be formed by the reaction of poly(vinyl 

alcohol) with an amino-aldehyde dialkyl acetal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making paper of increased
wet and dry strength from a feed comprising recycled paper without sacrificing repulpability.Cellulosic pulp based products comprise one of the largest and most
important commodity articles of commerce. The technology for cellulosic
pulp based paper products is well developed for virgin pulp and many
additives are employed to improve various properties. These properties
include wet and dry tensile strength, wet and dry tear strength, wet and
dry burst strength, oil resistance, fold resistance, stain resistance,
printability and the like. The use of recycled paper based materials is a
large emerging application area of considerable importance to the pulp and
paper industry. The utility of recycled pulp based products include both
100% recycled products as well as in admixture with virgin pulp.Both areas will generally require additives to upgrade the physical
properties of the resultant paper, cardboard or tissue (e.g. dry strength,
wet strength, burst strength, tear resistance) as the recycled paper will
show diminished properties in these categories. In some cases, the loss in
physical properties could be counterbalanced by utility of more recycled
pulp (higher basis weight). However, the added weight is not desired in
cases where light weight products are required or where increased shipping
weight would not be economically acceptable. In many cases, the standards
for container packaging require certain physical property conditions which
have been established for virgin pulp based products and cannot be readily
achieved with 100% recycle or recycle/virgin combinations. Polymeric
additives (e.g. cationic starch, cationic poly acrylamides) are often added
to improve dry strength, however, offer only limited applicability to wet
strength. Wet strength additives (e.g. poly(amido amine/epichlorohydrin)
require a thermal treatment or long aging at ambient conditions to generate
wet strength via crosslinking reactions. Once crosslinking has occurred,
the paper product cannot be easily repulped unless special treatments are
conducted to break-up the chemical crosslinks. Another common wet strength
additive is a formaldehyde based polymer (urea-formaldehyde and melamine
formaldehyde resins). These polymers not only have repulpability problems
but another environmental concern, namely, formaldehyde emissions. These
polymers have recently fallen out of favor because of formaldehyde
emissions and are being rapidly replaced. An additive offering
