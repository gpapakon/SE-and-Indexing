<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus is provided for separating a flock of 
animals into groups, prior to being slaughtered in a 

slaughterhouse. The apparatus comprises an oblong 
corridor (5) which is wide enough to allow the animals 

to turn around in the corridor, and at least one 
transverse wall (7; 8; 9) protrudes from one side wall 

of the corridor so far into the corridor that two 
animals cannot pass through the gap between the 

transverse wall and the other side wall of the 
corridor at the same time, whereas one animal has free 

access through the gap.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for
separating a flock of animals into groups.Usually, animals to be slaughtered are delivered
to a slaughterhouse in the form of fairly large flocks
of animals. In a known system a flock is separated
into smaller groups, each group being treated
separately.For example, in GB-A-2211389, pigs to be
slaughtered are divided into groups in pens in which
they are kept, until they are driven out and into a
stunning apparatus. A system of separating walls in
the pens serves to divide a flock of animals into
smaller groups. The separating walls are also used
when the animals are being driven out of the
slaughterhouse pens for stunning. The separation
process of the system is not very fast and may stress
animals when they are not willing to enter of their
own accord.An object of the invention is to provide
apparatus for achieving a high capacity separating
system acceptable to the animals giving an undisturbed
separation of a flock of animals into groups without
stressing the animals.According to the invention there is provided an apparatus
for separating a flock of slaughter animals into groups,
comprising an oblong corridor with at least one transverse wall,
the oblong corridor being wide enough to allow the animals to
turn around in the corridor, characterised in that the said
at least one transverse wall protrudes from one 
side wall of the corridor so far into the corridor
that two animals cannot pass through the gap between
the transverse wall and the other side wall of the
corridor at the same time, whereas one animal has free
access through the gap.The apparatus may be applied at the unloading
area of a slaughterhouse to separate a delivered flock
of animals into smaller groups before they are stalled
or handled further, but it may especially be applied
in connection with the separation of a flock of
animals from the pen area of the slaughterhouse into
smaller groups, which are to be driven into and
stunned in boxes which have room for one group of
animals in each box.The apparatus of the invention has proved to be
able to provide the separation in a very short time,
so that a supply of more than 720 animals per hour may
be achieved by means of fairly simple equipment.
Furthermore, the apparatus may be automated, so that
it becomes independent of operators. This
contributes to an increased capacity of separation,
since the animals are willing to enter the corridor of
their own accord, when there are no human beings in
the area.Means are preferably provided to

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for separating a flock of
slaughter animals into groups, comprising an oblong

corridor (5) with at least one transverse wall
(7; 8; 9), the oblong corridor being wide enough to

allow the animals to turn around in the corridor,
characterized in that the said at least one transverse

wall (7; 8; 9) protrudes from one side wall of the
corridor so far into the corridor that two animals

cannot pass through the gap between the transverse
wall and the other side wall of the corridor a
t the
same time, whereas one animal has free access through

the gap.
Apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterized in that means are provided to close the

gap between the transverse wall (7; 8; 9) and the
other side of the corridor.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
characterized in that transverse walls (7; 8; 9)

protrude alternately from one and from the other side
wall of the corridor.
Apparatus according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the floor area

between two transverse walls (7; 8; 9) in the corridor
is large enough to accommodate a group of 3-15,

preferably 4-8, animals.
Apparatus according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the transverse

wall (7; 8; 9) is designed with or as sliding walls.
Apparatus according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the transverse

wall (7; 8; 9) is of a grille construction, and 
preferably comprises of vertical bars fastened in a

frame.
Apparatus according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the apparatus

includes a registration unit which is designed to
register the number of animals in at least one of the

areas formed between two transverse walls (7; 8; 9),
preferably by means of a vision system.
