<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical pulse generation 
and, more particularly, to an optical pulse generator for 
use with the soliton propagation mode of intelligence 
bearing optical pulse trains. In the propagation of optical pulses over extreme 
distances, such as, for example, transoceanic distances, 
numerous parameters associated with such transmission limit 
the capacity of the optical fiber cable system through 
which the optical pulses are transmitted and, hence, the 
amount of intelligence that can be transmitted. The most 
obvious of such parameters is fiber loss, which degrades 
and diminishes the pulses passing therethrough. In 
general, such loss can be compensated by periodic pulse 
regeneration and amplification. Thus, in an extremely long 
cable transmission system, spaced regenerators are used for 
periodically restoring the pulses to a viable condition. 
Most recently, the use of erbium doped fiber amplification 
incorporated in the transmitting optical fibers has made it 
possible to transmit multi-gigabit per second pulse signals 
over extreme distances, such as transoceanic, without the 
necessity of regeneration of the signals. Thus, cable or 
fiber loss can be substantially eliminated as a factor in 
the transmission of pulse signals, leaving the parameters 
of fiber dispersion, fiber nonlinearities and amplifier 
noise as the limiting factors. As discussed in U.S. patent 
5,157,744 of Korotky, optical fibers are not strictly 
linear, but have a small amount of nonlinearity in their 
transmission characteristics which make possible a pulse  
 
transmission mode in the optical fiber that is effectively 
immune from the aforementioned pulse degradation factors. 
As will be discussed more fully hereinafter, this mode, 
known as "soliton propagation", effectively balances out 
the aforementioned factors provided the pulses have a 
required power level and hence velocity of propagation and 
a pulse shape in both the time and frequency domains that 
is optimum for compensating dispersion at a given power 
level and for reducing interference and cross-talk among 
pulses. Coupled with erbium doped amplification, which 
maintains the power required for soliton propagation, it is 
possible to transmit over large distances with minimum 
pulse degradation and loss resulting from the 
aforementioned factors as well as cross-talk. In soliton 
propagation, there is very little interaction among 
differing wavelength channels, hence, an additional 
significant advantage of such propagation is that
