<ABSTRACT>
A support exhibits a vertically adjustable column (13) and an adjustment device (11) which exhibits a through-passage (21). The column (13) is guided in the through-passage (21) of the adjustment device (11). The position of the column (13) can be fixed by a sleeve (23). For this purpose, the column (13) exhibits a multiplicity of spaced-apart grooves (25) into which the sleeve (23) fitting into the through-passage (21) can latch by means of protrusions (27). The sleeve (23) has a stop (29) and a plurality of resilient fingers (31). The fingers (31) exhibit, on the inner surface, protrusions (27) which have a shape corresponding to the groove (25). In order to adjust the column (13), all that has to be done is for the column (13) to be raised out of the adjustment device (11) and the sleeve (23) to be displaced to the desired position until the protrusions (27) latch in one of the grooves (25). Thereafter, the column can be lowered again as far as the stop.
