<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a device for mounting a wheel disc on 
a rim for a vehicle wheel. The fastening system for the wheel 

disc is made out of plastic and comprises peripheral beads (16) 
facing the rim and engaging one or several recesses or the 

like on the rim. The beads are supported by resilient tongues 
(13a, 13b) which are a flexible part of the fastening system 

and the beads cooperate with a resilient ring (19) pressing the 
beads against the recess. The tongues (13a,13b) are parts of a 

peripherally arranged cylinder shaped flange (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for mounting a wheel 
disc on a rim for a vehicle wheel, the fastening system of the 
wheel disc being made out of plastic and comprising peripheral 
beads facing the rim and engaging one or several recesses or 
the like on the rim the beads being supported by resilient 
tongues which are a flexible part of the fastening system in 
which the beads cooperate with a resilient ring pressing the 
beads against the recess. Devices of the type described above are previously known. 
These devices usually comprise spring elements in the form of 
tongues extending perpendicular to the plane of the wheel disc 
the outer ends of the tongues supporting the resilient ring. In 
order to achieve sufficient flexibility of the tongues and to 
prevent them from braking off during mounting they have to have 
a rather great length which means that the wheel disc demands 
for a certain axial extension of the rim resulting in 
difficulties to store and to transport the wheel discs. It also 
happens that the tongues are so much bent outwardly that the 
ring comes loose. Another drawback which the previously known 
devices have is that they presuppose the use of a closed 
resilient ring. Manufacturing such rings is complicated since 
it comprises a welding operation which, with respect to the 
material content of the ring can only be made by few producers. The purpose of this invention is to achieve a compact 
fasening system for a wheel disc that is a system having a 
small extension in the axial direction and which is easy to  
 
manufacture. Another purpose of the invention is to avoid the 
use of a closed ring and instead to use a ring which is open, 
the resilient elements holding the ring only having the 
possibility to yield a certain distance radially outwards. This is achieved by means of a device which has the 
caracteristics mentioned in the claims. An embodiment will now be described with reference to the 
accompanying drawing in which Fig. 1 in a perspective view 
shows a fastening system according to the invention, Fig. 2 is 
a section on the line II-II in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 shows one of the 
resilient elements in the construction in the same view as the 
element shown in Fig. 3 whereas Fig. 4 is a side view of the 
element shown in Fig. 3. As appears from Fig. 1 said fastening system comprises a 
plastic detail 11 which is shaped in one single piece with the 
wheel disc 12 or which in a suitable way is mounted on a wheel 
disc of any material. The detail comprises a peripheral
