<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
head substrate and an ink jet head using the same
wherein ink is ejected through an orifice in the form
of a droplet, more particularly to an ink jet head
substrate and an ink jet head using the same in which.
an ink jet head substrates ejecting the ink in a
direction perpendicular to the substrate having a
plurality of heat generating resistors for ejecting
the ink, are arranged on a flat plate staggeredly,
and/or, an ink jet unit having nozzles and ejection
outlets are staggeredly disposed on said ink jet head
substrate.An ink jet printing method as disclosed in
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 51837/1979,
for example, has peculiar features as compared with
other ink jet printing method in that the power for
ejecting the ink is thermal energy applied to the
liquid.More particularly, the recording or printing
method disclosed in the Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application, the liquid is heated by the thermal
energy to create a bubble, and the expanding force of
the bubble eject the liquid through an orifice at an
end of the recording head to the recording material so 
that a desired recording of information or pattern is
carried out. Generally, the ink jet head therefor,
comprises an orifice for ejecting the liquid, and a
liquid passage including heat acting portion where the
thermal energy for ejecting the droplet through the
orifice is applied to the liquid, which constitute a
liquid ejecting portion. It further comprises a heat
generating resistor layer (electrothermal transducer)
for generating thermal energy, an upper protection
layer for protecting the heat generating resistor
layer from the ink and a lower layer for accumulating
sheet.As disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application No. 95154/1984, the orifice plate is
bonded to the substrate, so that a recording head of
the type in which the liquid is ejected in a direction
perpendicular to the heat acting portion, is provided.Figure 8 shows a typical example of such a
type of recording head. A substrate (heater board)
100 has an elongated ink supply port (not shown) at
the center thereof. A plurality of heat generating
resistors are juxtaposed with the ink supply port
therebetween such that the distances between the heat
generating resistors and the ink supply port are
substantially the same. The ink is supplied from the
backside of the substrate 100. The electric wiring is
provided to supply the electric energy to the heat 
generating resistors, and is electrically connected
with
