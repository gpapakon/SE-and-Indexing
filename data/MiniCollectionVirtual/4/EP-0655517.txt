<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for modifying a surface material which can easily modify the characteristics of a surface material 
(e.g. control of the chemical composition of the surface material) and can develop a novel field of utilization of ultra-pure 

water. 
The method is characterized in that a surface material formed on a metal material is brought into contact with ultra-pure 

water 
in an oxygen-free atmosphere. The amount of eluted oxygen is preferably up to 1 ppm, and ultra-pure 

water is preferably 
boiled. The apparatus includes at least a chamber having inert gas introduction means for introducing an inert gas thereinto, and 

inert gas discharge means for discharging the inert gas therefrom, a container for ultra-pure 
water, disposed inside the chamber, 

for holding ultra-pure water, and means disposed in the chamber, for heating ultra-pure 
water held in the ultra-pure water container.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
modifying surface material. Conventionally ultra-pure water is used for diluting 
chemicals ( for instance for diluting 98 % sulfuric acid to a 
desired density) or for preparing chemicals ( for instance 
dissolving sodium hydroxide to prepare a 1 N sodium hydroxide 
sodium), for washing vessels such as a beaker or a tank, or for 
removing a chemical solution or residue of a chemical solution 
from a surface of a silicon wafer steeped into a chemical 
solution. Alsoultra pure water is used as a raw material for 
obtaininghydrogen or oxygen by means of electroanalysis. Thus, a 
range of use of ultra pure water is rather narrow. On the other hand, modification of characteristics of a 
surface material formed on a metallic material (such as control 
of the composition of the surface material) is executed by 
controlling a gas element or a reaction temperature when the 
surface material is formed, or making the surface react with 
other gas after the surface material is formed. Fig.13 shows an XPS analysis diagram for a surface material 
in a case where composition control is executed by changing the 
gas after a reaction for generation of the surface material. 
Fig. 13A is an XPS analysis diagram for a case where SUS 316L is 
reacted to fluorine gas for 8 minutes under a temperature of 
220°C, and Fig,13B shows a case where a thermal processing is 
executed, after the processing in Fig.13A, for 24 hours in a 
nitrogen atmosphere under a temperature of 400°C. In case of the 
surface shown in Fig.13A, a ratio of Fe vs F is 1:2.27 indicating  
 
a non-stoichiometric structure, while the surface shown in 
Fig.13B has an Fe vs F ratio of 1:2.00 indicating a 
stoichiometric structure of FeF₂. Fig.14 shows a result of comparison between a compound having 
a stoichiometric structure and that having a non-stoichiometric 
structure by exposing them to a fluorine gas and checking the 
barrier effect to the fluorine gas in termsof consumption 
pressure of a fluorine gas. As clearlyshown in Fig.14, in case 
of a surface having astoichiometrlc structure as indicated by the 
white circle, a pressure of fluorine is constant, and consumption 
of fluorine gas is notobserved, however, in case of a non-stoichiometric 
structure as indicated by the black circle, a 
pressure of fluorine gas decreases in association of elapse of 
time, which indicates consumption of fluorine gas. Namely a 
surface not having a stoichiometrlc structure dose not have a 
barrier effect
