<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates, in one aspect, to a process for preparing a storage-stable dispersion of a biocide which comprises the steps of: (a) mixing a plastisol, comprising a resin and a carrier, and a biocide to provide a mixture of said plastisol and said biocide (b) heating said mixture of plastisol and biocide to an elevated temperature of between about 30  DEG C and about 100  DEG C to provide a homogeneous, storage stable dispersion, and (c) cooling the dispersion to a temperature of between about -20  DEG C and about -40  DEG C to provide a storage-stable mixture having a viscosity of between about 2,000 and about 30,000 centipoise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
delivery system for polymer additives, and, more
specifically, to a process for providing physically
stable dispersions of a biocide in a carrier/resin
composition.Various methods for incorporating biocides into
resin compositions have been disclosed in the prior
art. By way of illustration, U.S. Patent 4,086,297
discloses a process for forming a solid thermoplastic
composition containing a microbiocide utilizing very
high levels of the microbiocide and two thermoplastic
resins in conjunction with melt blending processing.As another illustration, U.S. Patent 4,663,359
discloses a process for preparing a microbiocide
concentrate which is useful in plastisol systems. The
process comprises mixing a porous thermoplastic resin
powder with a high concentration of microbiocide at an
elevated temperature sufficient to melt the biocide and
open the pores of the resin, and incorporating the
melted biocide into the pores of the porous resin,
optionally in the presence of a carrier. The resulting
product is provided as a dry, free-flowing powder
containing the microbiocide in a high concentration at
least about 20 times greater than the normal upper usage
concentration for the microbiocide.Unfortunately, the products produced in
accordance with the above-mentioned '297 and '359
patents are solids which are frequently more difficult 
to process into a finished product than might be
desired. Liquid dispersions would avoid such solids
handling problems in subsequent processing steps.
Heretofore, however, suitable methods for incorporating
insoluble or difficult-to-solubilize additives, such as
biocides, into liquid dispersions has represented a
challenge to the plastics manufacturing community. The
solids in such liquid dispersions tend to settle out
over time, thus causing a non-uniform distribution of
the additive in the dispersion.In view of the above, new methods for
incorporating insoluble or difficult-to-solubilize
biocides into plastics resins that avoid the settling
and/or viscosity increase problems of the prior art
compositions would be highly desired by the plastics
manufacturing community.The present invention relates, in one aspect, to
a process for preparing a storage-stable dispersion of a
biocide which comprises the steps of: (a) mixing a
plastisol, comprising (preferably consisting essentially
of) a resin and a carrier, and a biocide to provide a
mixture of said plastisol and said biocide (b) heating
said mixture of plastisol and biocide to an elevated
tempe

A process for preparing a storage-stable dispersion
of a biocide characterized by the steps of:


a) mixing a plastisol, comprising a resin and a
carrier, and a biocide to provide a mixture of said

plastisol and said biocide,
b) heating said mixture of plastisol and biocide to
an elevated temperature of between 30°C and 100°C to

provide a homogeneous, storage stable dispersion, said
dispersion containing said biocide in an amount of between

1 and 30 weight percent based upon the weight of said
dispersion, said resin being present in an amount of

between 5 and 75 weight percent based upon the weight of
said dispersion, with the proviso that when the weight

percent of said resin in said dispersion is between 30%
and 75%, then said elevated temperature is between 30°C

and 45°C, and with the further proviso that when the
weight percent of said resin in said dispersion is between

5% and 29%, then said elevated temperature is between 46°C
and 100°C.
c) cooling the dispersion to a temperature of
between -20°C and 40°C to provide a storage-stable mixture
