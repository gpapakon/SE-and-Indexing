<ABSTRACT>
A method for suppressing a bitter taste of material to be 
placed in mouth or in contact with mouth, such as foods, 

drinks, pharmaceuticals, comprises adding an acidic phospholipid 
or an acidic lysophospholipid to the material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of certain substances
in the manufacture of a material to be placed in mouth or in
contact with mouth, such as foods, drinks, pharmaceuticals
for oral administration, and toiletries.A great number of foods, drinks, pharmaceuticals for
oral administration, toiletries which have a bitter taste
are known. Particularly, most of pharmaceuticals have a
bitter taste, and some difficulty or pain arises when
such pharmaceuticals are orally administered. Accordingly,
suppression of a bitter taste of pharmaceuticals have
been problems to be solved. Until now, the following
methods have been known. Typically, addition of a sweetener
or flavor has been employed. Japanese Patent Provisional
Publication No. 2-56416 discloses addition of
aspartame to pharmaceuticals, Also known are microcapsulation
and coating using material soluble in stomach.
Further known is chemical modification of a pharmaceutically
active component. Japanese Patent Provisional Publication
discloses use of a clathrate compound. These
methods are employable only for specific compounds or the
suppression of a bitter taste accomplished by these method
appears insufficient.For the suppression of a bitter taste in pharmaceuticals,
the addition of a lipid is also known. For instance,
Japanese Patent Publication No. 55-8966 discloses
addition of lecithin(phosphatidylcholine) and cephalin
singly or in combination. Japanese Patent Provisional 
Publication No. 62-265234 discloses addition of lecithin
(phosphatidylcholine). These methods, however, are still
insufficient to give the desired suppression of a bitter
taste.Patent Abstracts of Japan: JP 20 279 43 describes edible
oil and fat compositions containing a phosphatidic acid/lysophosphatidic
acid containing excipient. Patent Abstracts of
Japan: JP 3 206 855 describes the use of lysophosphatidic acid
in the manufacture of bread. Patent Abstracts of Japan: JP 2
312 550 describes the application of phosphatidic acid in food,
cosmetic and medicine. Finally, it is known from Derwent publications
Ltd., London, GB; AN 92-361373 & JP-A-4 262 761 that
phosphatidic acid may be used in the manufacture of mayonnaise.Infants and aged persons sometimes reject oral administration
of solid pharmaceutical preparations. For
this reason, syrup preparations are frequently employed.
However, no appropriate methods to suppress a bitter
taste of syrup preparations have been known.In foods and drinks, there are certain bitter substances.
For instance, bitter tastes of amino acids prepared
by

Use of an acidic phospholipid or an acidic lysophospholipid
in the manufacture of a material to be placed

in mouth or in contact with mouth for suppressing a bitter
taste.
The use as defined in claim 1, wherein the
acidic phospholipid or lysophospholipid is added to the

material in the form of a lipid mixture containing at
least 20 wt.% of the acidic phospholipid or lysophospholipid

therein.
The use as defined in claim 1, wherein the
acidic phospholipid or lysophospholipid is added to the

material in the form of a lipid mixture whose neutral
lipid content is less than 30 wt.%.
The use as defined in claim 1, wherein both
the acidic phospholipid and lysophospholipid are added to

the material.
The use as defined in claim 1, wherein the
acidic phospholipid or lysophospholipid is added to the

material in the form of a lipid mixture whose neutral
phospholipid content is 2 weight parts or less per 1

weight part of the acidic phospholipid or lysophospholipid.
The use as defined in claim 1, wherein the
acidic phospholipid or lysophospholipid is added to the

material in the form of a lipid mixture whose neutral
phospholipid content is 0.2 weight part or less per 1

weight part of the acidic phospholipid or lysophospholipid. 
The use as defined in claim 1, wherein the
acidic phospholipid or lysophospholipid is phosphatidic

acid or lysophosphatidic acid, respectively.
The use as defined in claim 1, wherein the
material is selected from the group consisting of foods,

drinks, pharmaceuticals for oral administration, tooth
paste, and mouthwash.
The use as defined in claim 1, wherein the
acidic phospholipid or lysophospholipid is coated on the

surface of the material.
The use as defined in claim 1, wherein the
acidic phospholipid or lysophospholipid is added in an

amount of 0.01 to 60 weight parts to one weight part of
the material.
The use as defined in claim 1, wherein the
acidic phospholipid or lysophospholipid is added in an

amount of 0.05 to 30 weight parts to one weight part of
the material.
