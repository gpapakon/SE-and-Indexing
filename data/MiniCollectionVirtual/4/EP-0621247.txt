<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the technical domain of annulus
cementing of oil, water and geothermal wells or the like.These operations have been very well known in the art, as well as in
their principle that in their performance ; the great difficulties of their
performance have been also well known.Thus, these data would be really uselessly recalled here. That is why
only the essential will be briefly mentioned below.The well cementing operation consists schematically of preparing at the
surface a cement slurry which is then pumped under pressure into the tubing
or casing. Such downwardly pumped slurry displaces the drilling mud which
circulates up the surface (where it is carried off) through the annulus, i.e. the
area between the borehole and the casing.The cement slurry is itself displaced by an inert fluid, the pumped
volumes computations being so as the pumping is stopped when the mud has
been replaced by the slurry in the annulus, while a inert fluid is into the inside
of the casing. The cement slurry is then let to set into the annulus. This set
cement has then two functions : isolation of the different underground zones
and casing mechanical support.It has been appreciated that, to succeed in carrying out such an
operation, the mastering or monitoring of the slurry rheology is of primary
importance.The control of very numerous parameters is also of prime concern : fluid
loss, free water, settling, thickening time (or "TT"), development of
compressive strength, especially at the beginning of the settling, etc..., cement
permeability testing against the fluids which degrade it, etc....It must also be appreciated that, since the temperature and pressure
cycles to which the cement slurry is submitted, i.e. surface → downhole →
surface, are entirely specific of the considered industry, the preceeding
subjects are extremely difficult to solve. Further more, the adjustment of the cement slurry density is also very
important for ensuring the hydrostatic equilibrium. If the density is too low, the
risk is that external fluids may migrate towards the casing and may be then the
cause of damages. If, on the contrary, the density is too high, the risk is that
fracturing fragile formation may occur with serious consequences. These risks
and their inherent requirements are also very specific of the considered
industry. All this is also very well known in the art.Numerous additives of different kinds are also known and they are used
in the art alone or in various combinations in order to design the better

A cement slurry for cementing oil, water, gas geothermal wells and the like,
comprising a mixing fluid such as water and an insoluble particulate mixture comprising

of at least three size-distinctive particulate materials selected from a group consisting of:

(i) particles having an average particle size greater than 1 mm, for example glass
maker sand or crushed wastes ('very large');
(ii) particles having an average particle size of from 200-800µm, for example sand or
crushed wastes ('large');
(iii) particles having an average particle size of from 10-20 µm, for example materials
of the type of hydraulic material or other binder, or crushed wastes ('medium');
(iv) particles having an average particle size of from 0.5-10 µm, for example micromaterial,
or some micro fly ashes or some other micro slags ('fine');
(v) particles having an average particle size of from 0.05-0.5 µm for example a latex
or some pigments or some polymers like a usual fluid loss control agent ('very

fine');

colloidal well dispersed silica or alumina ('ultra-fine').

binder such as cement, at least one of the selected particulate material is of an average

dimension finer than cement, the relative proportions of the size-distinctive particulate materials are

combination of solid materials and the concentration of solid particulate materials in the
mixing fluid is such that the slurry exhibits a hindered settling state, where the solid

particles behave collectively like a porous solid material.
