<ABSTRACT>
A stealth interface for an intelligent front-end communication system which couples a plurality of actively redundant process control computers to a computer network. The stealth interface in each of the actively redundant process control computers includes a multi-ported memory for storing dynamic data associated with the physical process and for transferring this data to a front end computer which is in communication with the computer network. The multi-ported memory also includes a mailbox section for storing messages sent between the front end computer and its actively redundant process control computer. The stealth interface also includes a guardian circuit which ultimately controls the ability of the front end computer to write information to specific memory locations in the multi-ported data memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to "front-end" 
communication techniques between process control 
computers and a plant/local area network. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to a "stealth" 
interface for a front-end communication system which is 
capable of transparently handling rapid data transfers to 
and from a process control computer with very high 
reliability and security. In chemical manufacturing plants and other 
relatively large processing plants, a network of control 
computers and operator workstations may be needed to achieve 
automated control of an ongoing physical process in the 
plant. For example, the Jones et. al U.S. Patent No. 
4,663,704, issued on May 5, 1987, shows a distributed 
processing system for a plant in which a single data highway 
connects all the various input/output terminals, data 
acquisition stations, control devices, record keeping 
devices and so forth. Similarly, the Henzel U.S. Patent No. 
4,607,256, issued on August 19, 1986, shows a plant 
management system which utilizes a plant control bus for the 
purpose of transmitting data to physical computer modules on 
the network. In some of these process control computer networks, 
redundant process control computers are employed to enhance 
the reliability of the plant control and monitoring system. 
For example, the Fiebig et. al U.S. Patent No. 5,008,805, 
issued on April 16, 1991, shows a networked control system 
which includes a "hot standby" redundant processor that 
synchronously processes a control schedule table for 
comparison with control messages from a sender processor 
that are transmitted on the network. The redundant listener 
processor maintains a duplicate configuration in its memory 
ready to take over control of the system in the event of a  
 
failure of the sender processor. As another example, the 
McLaughlin et. al U.S. Patent No. 4,958,270, issued on 
September 18, 1990, shows a networked control system which 
employs a primary controller and a secondary controller. In 
order to maintain consistency between-the primary data base 
and a secondary image of the data base, only predetermined 
areas changed are updated as a way of increasing the 
efficiency of the update function. Similarly, the Slater 
U.S. Patent No. 4,872,106, issued on October 3, 1989, shows 
a networked control system which employs a primary data 
processor and a back-up data processor. Normally, the back-up 
processor will be in a back-up mode of operation, and it 
will not operate to exercise
