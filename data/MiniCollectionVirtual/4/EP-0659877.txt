<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a stable, concentrated fabric rinse composition comprising 0.1 to 20, 
preferably 1 to 10% by weight of a UV absorber selected from a 

hydroxyaryl-1,3,5-triazine, a sulphonated-1,3,5-triazine, an o-hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole 
or a 2-aryl-2H-benzotriazole, based on the total weight of the composition, and a fabric 

care ingredient, preferably a fabric softener, a stain release or stain repellant ingredient or 
a water-proofing agent, the remainder being substantially water. The fabric rinse 

composition is preferably a fabric softener composition comprising 5 to 25, preferably 10 
to 20% by weight of a cationic fabric softening agent and 0.1 to 20, preferably 1 to 10% by 

weight of a UV absorber selected from a hydroxyaryl-1,3,5-triazine, a 
sulphonated-1,3,5-triazine, an o-hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole or a 2-aryl-2H-benzotriazole, 

each based on the total weight of the composition, the remainder being substantially water.

comprising applying, to the previously washed article, the said fabric rinse composition, 
preferably the rinse cycle fabric softener composition, whereby the SPF value of articles 

so treated can be significantly increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition for the treatment of textiles, in particular to
a fabric care composition containing a UV absorber; and to a method of treating textiles
with the composition, which method imparts to textile fibre material so treated, in addition
to an excellent sun protection factor (SPF) value, and other desirable properties.It is known that light radiation of wavelengths 280-400 nm permits tanning of the
epidermis. Also known is that rays of wavelengths 280-320 nm (termed UV-B radiation),
cause erythemas and skin burning which can inhibit skin tanning.Radiation of wavelengths 320-400 nm (termed UV-A radiation) is known to induce skin
tanning but can also cause skin damage, especially to sensitive skin which is exposed to
sunlight for long periods. Examples of such damage include loss of skin elasticity and the
appearance of wrinkles, promotion of the onset of erythemal reaction and the inducement
of phototoxic or photoallergic reactions.Any effective protection of the skin from the damaging effects of undue exposure to
sunlight clearly needs to include means for absorbing both UV-A and UV-B components
of sunlight before they reach the skin surface.Traditionally, protection of exposed human skin against potential damage by the UV
components in sunlight has been effected by directly applying to the skin a preparation
containing a UVA. In areas of the world, e.g. Australia and America, which enjoy
especially sunny climates, there has been a great increase in the awareness of the potential
hazards of undue exposure to sunlight, compounded by fears of the consequences of
alleged damage to the ozone layer. Some of the more distressing embodiments of skin
damage caused by excessive, unprotected exposure to sunlight are development of
melanomas or carcinomas on the skin.One aspect of the desire to increase the level of skin protection against sunlight has been
the consideration of additional measures, over and above the direct protection of the skin.
For example, consideration has been given to the provision of protection to skin covered
by clothing and thus not directly exposed to sunlight.Most natural and synthetic textile materials are at least partially permeable to UV 
components of sunlight. Accordingly, the mere wearing of clothing does not necessarily
provide skin beneath the clothing with adequate protection against damage by UV
radiation. Although clothing containing a deeply coloured dye and/or having a tight weave
texture may provide a reasonable level of protection
