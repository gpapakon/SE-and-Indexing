<ABSTRACT>
Piston rods (34a, b) are coupled to respective 
pistons (32a, b) movably disposed respective cylinder 

chambers (30a, b) defined in a cylinder body (12). The 
piston rods have distal ends connected to an end plate (36) 

mounted on a slide table (16) which is mounted for movement 
along a guide rail (14). When the piston rods (34a, b) are 

displaced by the pistons (32a, b), the slide table (16) is 
also displaced axially of the cylinder body (12). When the 

slide table (16) is positioned at either end of its stroke, 
a load is applied by the weight of a workpiece supported on 

the slide table (16) and the weight of the slide table 
itself to the cylinder body (12) through the guide rail 

(14). The slide table (16) is thus prevented from being 
unduly flexed under the load. The length of the slide table 

can be set to a desired length irrespective of an increase 
in the displacement of the slide table. Even if the 

displacement of the slide table is increased, the slide 
table is not flexed and hence remains highly rigid against 

flexure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an actuator operable for
smoothly displacing a slide table through linear guide
mechanismus.Actuators with slide tables coupled thereto often find use in
an application for feeding a workpiece from one position to
another.US patent 3,439,581 discloses a slide unit according to the
preamble of claim 1. The slide table, however, is mounted on
top of the cylinder body, thereby necessarily increasing the
height of the actuator unit.Further, various actuators with slide tables have been
proposed in the art as disclosed in Japanese laid-open utility
model publications Nos. 2-31902 and 62-185905, for example.According to Japanese laid-open utility model publication No.
2-31902, a piston rod is displaced when a cylinder in an
actuator body is moved. A slide table having a substantially
L-shaped cross section has one end held on a distal end of the
piston rod, and a linear guide mechanism is disposed between
the actuator body and the slide table.According to Japanese laid-open utility model publication No.
62-185905, a pair of brackets on opposite ends of an actuator
body is coupled to two piston rods, and a slide table which 
functions virtually as a cylinder body is disposed on an upper
surface of the actuator body. The slide table is reciprocally
movable along the actuator rods between the brackets. The actuator with the slide table has a linear
guide mechanism including balls rollingly movable between a
guide rail and the slide table which is displaceable along
the guide rail for thereby smoothly displacing the slide
table.Japanese laid-open utility model publication No.
1-63817 discloses a linear guide mechanism comprising a
guide rail having a ball rolling groove, a guide block
having a ball rolling groove confronting the ball rolling
groove of the guide rail and a through hole parallel to the
ball rolling groove for passage of balls therethrough, an
end cap having a semiannular ball circulation path and
joined to an end of the guide block, a plurality of balls
rollingly inserted in the ball rolling grooves, and a
retainer for retaining the balls.Specifically, as shown in FIG. 1 of the accompanying
drawings, the disclosed linear guide mechanism has a
guide block 2, an end cap 4 joined to an end of the guide
block 2, and a retainer 6 inserted in an hole defined in the
end cap 6. The guide block 2, the end cap 4, and the retainer
6 jointly define a ball circulation path 8.With the actuator disclosed in Japanese laid-open
utility model publication No. 2-31902, when the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An actuator (260) comprising:

a cylinder body (262) having a cylinder chamber (30) defined
therein in an axial direction thereof for a predetermined

length and a recess (26) defined therein on an extension of
the axis of the cylinder chamber;
a guide rail (14) mounted on said cylinder body (262) and
extending in the axial direction from one end to another end

of the cylinder body;
a slide table (276) mounted on said guide rail (14) for
movement along the guide rail;
a piston (32) movably disposed in said cylinder chamber (30);
a piston rod (34) coupled to said piston (32) for movement
along said recess (26) in response to movement of said piston;

and
an end plate (278) mounted on an end of said slide table (276)
and holding a distal end of said piston rod,
characterized in that
 said cylinder body (262) has a land
(264) displaced to one side thereof from a central axis

thereof and extending longitudinally of the cylinder body,
said land having an upper surface lying substantially flush

with an upper surface of said slide table (276).
An actuator (260) according to claim 1, wherein only one
piston (32) is movably disposed in said cylinder body (262). 
An actuator (260) according to claim 1, wherein said
cylinder body (262) has another set of a cylinder chamber

(30), a recess (26), a piston (32) and a piston rod (34), a
distal end of said other piston rod being held by said end

plate (278).
