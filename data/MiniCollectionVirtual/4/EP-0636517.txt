<ABSTRACT>
A double-wall structure having an insulating layer which is situated in regions between a base wall and a covering wall is produced in that an insulating layer material is placed/bonded to selected sections of the surface of the base wall, on/to which the covering wall is placed/bonded on a plane extending over a relatively large section of the surface. This composite structure is then jointly thermoformed, the insulating layer material acting, on account of its stability under pressure, as a mould, which causes the double-wall structure to become a profile body. Beyond the insulating layer surface sections the base wall and the covering wall are bonded to one another. Bitumen is used in particular as an insulating layer material. This does not just result in a considerable increase in the rigidity of the component, but also in a considerably improved acoustic behaviour.

A method of producing a vehicle body part which over at least some areas 
has a double wall structure with an intermediate insulating-layer, the base 

wall or sheet (1) and the cover sheet (2) of the double wall structure being 
initially secured together with interposition of the insulating-layer (3) and 

then jointly shaped, especially deep-drawn, characterised by the following 
features: 


a suitable insulating-layer material (3) is placed only on selected areas of the 
flat base sheet (1), followed by a flat cover sheet (2) which extends over a 

greater area, wherein the material forming the insulating-layer (3), at least 
in the edge region thereof, is sufficiently pressure-resistant to hold the base 

sheet (1) apart from the cover sheet (2) in the insulating-layer area, in spite 
of the shaping process, 
the insulating-layer material (3) is stuck to the base sheet (1) and the cover 
sheet (2), and/or the base sheet (1) and the cover sheet (2), before being 

jointly shaped, are secured to one another at least at places, at a distance 
from the insulating-layer (3), and 
the base sheet (1) and the cover sheet (2) are stuck together at least at 
edge regions (6) of the double-wall structure. 
A method according to claim 1,
 
characterised by at least one of the following features: 


the adhesive required for sticking is applied in the form of a sheet or sealing 
cord or rolling or spray film or adhesive bead or drops, 
the base sheet (1) is stuck to the cover sheet (2) by a spot-weldable  
 

adhesive, especially a hot-melt adhesive, which is set by controlled local 
heating over certain areas or spots (13) at a distance from the places where 

weld points (8) are subsequently made, 
the base sheet (1) and the cover sheet (2) are stuck by a contact adhesive 
in addition to a hot-melt adhesive, 
some of the joints (5, 6) between the base sheet (1) and the cover sheet 
(2) are spot-welded, 
an only slightly shapable insulating-layer board is cut or notched at the 
places where shaping is extensive, 
before joint shaping, an adhesive bead (14) is applied in an edge region of 
the double-wall structure and has a thickness such that after the base sheet 

(1) and the cover sheet (2) have been shaped or joined by spot welding 
(weld 8) or clinching, the adhesive bead (14) exerts a bending and 

compressive stress in the base sheet (1) and/or the cover sheet (2) in a 
region between the adhesive bead (14) and the intermediate layer (3), 
after shaping, only the cover plate (2) is cut at the side of an adhesive bead 
(14), a clamp engaging in the region of the bead (14), 
at edge regions (6) of the double-wall structure, the base sheet (1) and the 
cover sheet (2) are joined positively by local indentation (10) or by 

production of undercut regions (11), 
after shaping, a swelling process is initiated in the insulating-layer (3) and/or 
the insulating-layer material is softened, 
(complete) setting of the adhesive and/or the swelling process is brought  
 

about by heat treatment after shaping, e.g. when the body part is being 
lacquered, and 
attached parts are attached by welding at a joint (5) between the base sheet 
(1) and the cover sheet (2). 
A vehicle body part made by the method according to claim 1 or claim 2 and 
characterised by at least one of the following features: 


the insulating-layer (3) is of bitumen or plastics material or cardboard or is 
in the form of hardboard or pressboard or comprises a knobbed metal sheet 

or a knitted wire fabric, 
the edge of the insulating-layer region is formed by an inserted wire (9), 
especially a square-section wire, 
functional parts such as guides, ducts, threaded sleeves or the like are 
inserted in the insulating-layer, 
the thickness (d) of the insulating-layer varies over the area thereof and is 
adapted to the loads which occur, and 
the insulating-layer (3) is in a number of thicknesses, optionally graduated 
in size.
