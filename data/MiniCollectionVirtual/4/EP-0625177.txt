<DESCRIPTION>
 NOVEL REFRIGERANT COMPOSITIONSBACKGROUND OP THE INVENTIONFluorocarbon based fluids have found widespread use in industry for refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump applications.Vapor compression cycles are one common form of refrigeration. In its simplest form, the vapor compression cycle involves changing the refrigerant from the liquid to the vapor phase through heat absorption at a low pressure, and then from the vapor to the liquid phase through heat removal at an elevated pressure.While the primary purpose of refrigeration is to remove energy at low temperature, the primary purpose of a heat pump is to add energy at higher temperature. Heat pumps are considered reverse cycle systems because for heating, the operation of the condenser is inter¬ changed with that of the refrigeration evaporator.The art is continually seeking new fluorocarbon based fluids which offer alternatives for refrigeration and heat pump applications. Currently, of particular interest, are fluorocarbon based mixtures which are considered to be environmentally acceptable substitutes for the presently used chlorofluorocarbons. The latter, such as monochlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22) are suspected of causing environmental problems in connection with the earth's protective ozone layer. 

 The substitute materials must also possess those properties unique to the chlorofluoroσarbons including similar refrigeration characteristics, chemical stability, low toxicity, non-flammability, efficiency in-use and low temperature glides.By "similar refrigeration characteristics" is meant a vapor pressure which is plus or minus 20 percent of the reference refrigerant at the same temperature.The characteristic of efficiency in-use is important, for example, in air conditioning and refrigeration where a loss in refrigerant thermodynamic performance or energy efficiency may have secondary environmental impacts through increased fossil fuel usage arising from an increased demand for electrical energy.Low temperature glides have the following described significance. The condensation and evaporation temperatures of single component refrigerant fluids are defined clearly. If the small pressure drops in the refrigerant lines are ignored, the condensation or evaporation occurs at a single temperature corresponding to the condenser or evaporation pressure. For mixtures employed as refrigerants, there is no single phase change temperature but a range of temperatures. This range is governed by the vapor-liquid equilibrium behavior of the mixture.
