<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an automatic cutting installation for cutting sheet material, and comprising at least one cutting device (40) and at least one device (42) for stacking the sheets (124) to be cut. The cutting device comprises a frame (44), a cutting head (62) mounted on displacement means (64). The frame comprises, from its infeed end to its discharge end, a cutting area (54) under which is mounted the suction cutting conveyor (60) and a discharge conveyor (58). The turbine means (66) for creating the suction are arranged under the discharge conveyor, and the cutting head (62) is mounted on the face of the displacement means (64) turned towards the infeed end of the frame.

<CLAIMS>
An installation for automatically cutting sheet material, the installation 
comprising at least one cutting device (40, 130) and at least one stacking device 

(42, 132, 134) for stacking sheets (124) to be cut, the cutting device comprising a 
bench (44) having a feed end (46) suitable for co-operating with the outlet end of 

the stacking device and an end (48) for unloading sheets that have been cut out, a 
cutting head (62) mounted on means (64) for displacing it relative to the bench, a 

cutting conveyor (60) using suction created by turbine means (66) and an 
unloading conveyor (58), the installation being characterized in that the bench 

includes a top face (50) that, running from its feed end to its unloading end, defines 
a cutting zone (54) beneath which the suction cutting conveyor (60) and an 

unloading conveyor (58) are mounted, in that the turbine means (66) for creating 
suction are disposed beneath the unloading conveyor, in that said cutting head 

(62) is mounted on the face of the displacement means (64) that faces towards the 
feed end of the bench, and in that means (68) for supporting at least one roll of 

impermeable film (70) are mounted about said top face of the bench, substantially 
at its feed end (46). 
The automatic cutting installation according to calm 1, characterized 
in that said means for supporting rolls of film are suitable for simultaneously 

supporting two rolls (70, 72), optionally of different width. 
The automatic cutting installation according to any one of claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that to allow a support sheet (110) to be placed on the 

spreading table (42, 130) beneath the stack of sheets (124) to be transferred, the 
installation further includes, between the feed end and the cutting zone (54) a zone 

(52) for receiving the stack of sheets to be cut, said zone being short and being 
provided with perforating means (74) for perforating said support sheet as it 

advances together with said stack of sheets (124) towards the cutting zone (54). 
The automatic cutting installation according to claim 3, characterized 
in that said perforation means (74) comprise a cylinder (112) provided on its lateral 

face with perforation tools (114), said cylinder being mounted free to rotate about a 
horizontal axis (116) perpendicular to the displacement direction of the stacks of 

sheets, and means (122) for displacing the axis of said cylinder between an active 
position in which it perforates the support sheet (110) and an open position in 

which it is possible to insert said support sheet.  
 
The automatic cutting installation according to any one of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the turbine suction means (82) include control means (88, 

92) for producing a first level of suction while said conveyors (58, 60) are in use, 
and a second level of suction, higher than the first, during the operation of cutting 

by means of said cutting head. 
The automatic cutting installation according to claim 5, characterized 
in that said turbine suction means include silencer-forming means (80) and 

additional means (96, 100, 102) for cooling the motor (88) which means are also 
designed to deliver a flow of air into the duct (86) connecting the outlet of the 

turbine (82) to the silencer, which flow of air is at a temperature that is lower than 
the temperature of the air at the outlet from the turbine. 
The automatic cutting installation according to any one of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that it comprises a plurality of stationary stacking devices (132, 

134) disposed parallel to one another, a cutting device (130), means (136, 138) for 
guiding displacement of the cutting device perpendicularly to said stacking 

devices, and means (142, 144, 146) for controlling the displacement of the cutting 
device and for stopping it successively in register with each stacking device. 
The automatic cutting installation according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said cutting device (130) includes a first 

electrical connection assembly (152), and in that each stacking device (132, 134) 
includes a second electrical connection assembly (150) designed to co-operate 

with the first electrical connection assembly when the cutting device is in register 
with the corresponding stacking device. 
The automatic cutting installation according to claim 8, characterized 
in that said first electrical connection assembly (152) includes means (154) for 

adjusting its position along the displacement direction of the cutting device relative 
to the second electrical connection assembly (150) of the corresponding stacking 

device. 
The automatic cutting installation according to claim 9, 
characterized in that the first connection assembly (150) includes a first connector 

portion (236) and a cam-forming assembly (272), and in that the second 
connection assembly (152) includes an indexing element (264), said two members 

being mounted on a set of two moving supports (244, 248) suitable for enabling 
said two members to move in two orthogonal directions, said indexing element 

being suitable for co-operating with said cam-forming assembly.
