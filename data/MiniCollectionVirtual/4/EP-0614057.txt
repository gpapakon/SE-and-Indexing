<ABSTRACT>
The boiler arrangement (2) has a frame (5) in which the boiler (3) is held. The frame legs (7) are telescopically extendable. Owing to the extendability of the frame legs (7), simple installation of the boiler arrangement (2) in niches of residential rooms is possible, as well as a stretcher-like construction of the boiler arrangement (2) for its transportation. A shelf can be fitted in the space bounded by the frame legs (7). By using a one-piece boiler heat insulation (1), there are no heat losses due to the stack effect, as in the case of multi-piece insulations. In addition, the insulation can be removed simply by cutting it open. An advantageously designed sacrificial-electrode arrangement permits easy mounting and dismounting.
