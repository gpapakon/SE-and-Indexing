<ABSTRACT>
An antidiabetic agent contains a spherical carbon (for example, an activated 
spherical carbon or a spherical carbonaceous adsorbent) as an active ingredient. The 

antidiabetic agent can be used for treating diabetes, preferably by oral administration 
and may be not painful to a patient conventional as opposed to injections of insulin. 

Unlike conventional antidiabetics, the antidiabetic agent may not induce hypoglycemia.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antidiabetic agent comprising a spherical
carbon as an active ingredient.Diabetes include primary diabetes which is mainly induced by hereditary
causes and which is primarily caused by insulin deficiency, and secondary diabetes
which is induced by acquired causes. A sympton common to the two types of diabetes
is hyperglycemia, which causes complications such as neurophathy or retinopathy. The
progress of these complications results in deuteropathies such as serous infection, sudden
death, blindness, heart failure, cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, and the like.
Therefore, sufficient care must be given to chronic complications. Insulin and the orally
administrable medicines such as sulfonylurea agents and biguanide agents are
conventionally used as antidiabetics.However, insulin is completely ineffective when administered orally, and is
nowadays clinically administered only by injection, which is painful to the patient. In
addition to the pain, redness, swelling, induration, itching, etc. sometimes occur at the
site of the injection. Further, repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site
sometimes cause lipodystrophy such as atrophy or hypertrophy of subcutaneous fat.
Hypoglycemia may also occur as a serious side effect of taking insulin. Specifically,
sufficient care should be taken not to cause hypoglycemia due to over-injection.
Careful
administration is required for the patient in order to avoid condition which is liable to
cause hypoglycemia.The above mentioned orally administrable antidiabetics cannot substitute
completely for insulin insulin is still indispensable, because the orally administrable
antidiabetics have no effect on diabetic conditions such as diabetic coma, juvenile
diabetes, diabetes with ketoacidosis and serious infection.Medicines of the sulfonylurea agent group include tolbutamide,
chlorpropamide, acetohexamide, tolazamide, glibenclamide, etc., all of which sometimes
cause serious and delayed hypoglycemia and, thus, must be carefully administered.Medicines of the biguanide agent group include buformin, metformin, etc.,
which sometimes cause serious lactic acidosis or hypoglycemia and, thus, must be
carefully administered. It is an object of the present invention to provide an antidiabetic agent
comprising a spherical carbon comprising an activated carbon, as an active ingredient.It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of treating
diabetes which avoids the problems caused by insulin injections and
