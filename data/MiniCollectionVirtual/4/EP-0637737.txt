<ABSTRACT>
A method of inspecting a pipe liner bag is provided 
for efficiently and accurately performing in parallel 

inspections for a hardened condition and air-tight 
sealing effect of the pipe liner bag. A main pipe (1) 

and a branch pipe (2) are lined with hardened pipe liner 
bags (3, 4), and then all open ends of the pipe liner 

bags are air-tightly sealed by air plugs (5, 6, 7) to 
define an air-tight sealed space (S) within the pipe 

liner bags. Then, while the pressure within the sealed 
space is
 decreased, the inspections are made for a 
hardened condition and air-tight sealing effect of the 

pipe liner bag. If the pipe liner bag includes 
incompletely hardened portions, such portions will be 

deformed due to compression buckling, so that the 
deformed portions can be readily found by a TV camera 

(10) equipped with a light emitting unit. In this 
manner, a hardened condition of the pipe liner bag can 

be accurately inspected. Also, if the pipe liner bags 
do not provide a sufficient air-tight sealing effect, 

the inner pressure within the sealed space (S) will be 
increased, so that monitoring the inner pressure within 

the sealed space by a vacuum gauge (24) permits an 
inspection to be readily and accurately made for an 

air-tight sealing effect of the pipe liner bags.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pipe lining techniques, and
more particularly to a method of inspecting a pipe liner bag.When an underground pipe, such as a pipeline or passageway,
becomes defective or too old to perform properly, the pipe is
repaired and restored without digging the earth to expose the
pipe and disassembling the sections of the pipe. This non-digging
method of repairing an underground pipe has been known and
practiced commonly in the field of civil engineering. Typically,
the method is disclosed by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 60-242038.According to the method described in the above-mentioned
publication, the pipe repair method comprises inserting a
sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag into the pipe to be
repaired by means of a pressurized fluid, such as air or water. The
tubular liner bag is made of a flexible resin-absorbent material
impregnated with a thermosetting resin, and has its outer surface
covered with an impermeable plastic film.More particularly, according to the publication, the tubular
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, and then the closed
end of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open
end of the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked
(anchored) at the end of the defective or old pipe in a manner 
such that the wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly
covers and closes the pipe end; a portion of the liner is pushed
into the pipe; then, the pressurized fluid is applied to the
portion of the tubular liner such that the fluid urges the tubular
liner to enter the pipe. Since one end of the tubular liner is
hooked at the end of the pipe, it remains there while the rest of
the flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds deeper
in the pipe. (Hereinafter, this manner of procedure shall be
called "everting".) When the entire length of the tubular liner
bag is everted (i.e., turned inside out) into the pipe, the
control rope holds the closed end of the tubular liner bag to
thereby control the length of the tubular liner in the pipe.
Then, the everted tubular liner is pressed against the inner wall
of the pipe by the pressurized fluid, and the tubular flexible
liner is hardened as the thermosetting resin impregnated in the
liner is heated, which is effected by heating the fluid filling
the tubular liner bag by means of hot steam, etc. It is thus
possible to line the inside wall of the defective or old pipe with
a rigid

<CLAIMS>
A method of inspecting a pipe liner bag for use in
repairing a pipeline, comprising the steps of:


lining the inner wall of a pipeline (1) with a
hardened pipe liner bag (3);
air-tightly sealing all open ends of the pipe liner
bag;
decreasing an inner pressure within the sealed pipe
liner bag; and
inspecting a hardened condition and/or an air-tight
sealing effect provided by the pipe liner bag.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that at least one of the open ends of said pipe liner

bag (3) is air-tightly sealed by an air plug (6) having
a stopper (19).
A method as claimed in claim 2, characterized in
that said air plug (6) comprises an air bag (18), a

vacuum pipe (17) and a stopper (19), said air bag being
coupled to a compressor (C) such that said compressor is

driven to supply compressed air to said air bag, said
air bag being inflated by the supplied compressed air to

air-tightly seal the open end of said pipe liner bag (3).
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that at least one of the open ends of

said pipe liner bag (3) is air-tightly sealed by a
movable air plug (5), said movable air plug being

equipped with a TV camera (10) having light emitting
means mounted in a front end portion thereof, said TV

camera having light emitting means being used to monitor
