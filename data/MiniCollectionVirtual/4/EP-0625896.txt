<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the mechanical arts. 
In particular, it relates to an improved passenger lift 
integrating safety features. There is an increasing sensitivity to the need 
for facilitating the mobility of all members of our 
society, including people who have difficulty in walking 
and people who use wheelchairs. Such people often have 
difficulty moving between different levels, such as 
getting into and out of vehicles and using stairways. 
Consequently, there is a great need for passenger lifts 
to transport people into and out of vans and buses and 
between the floors of buildings. Passenger lifts, perse, are well known in the 
art. Representative passenger lifts are described in 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,534,450 and Re. 31,178 (reissue of 
U.S. Patent No. 3,913,759). To be effective, passenger 
lifts must be reliable, cost effective and, most 
importantly, safe. Among the various types of safety features 
which have been included in wheelchair lifts are 
restraining devices, such as restraining belts and 
barrier plates -- plates attached to the sides and 
ends of a lift platform, perpendicular to the platform's 
surface. These restraining devices help prevent 
wheelchairs from rolling off lifts when the lifts are in 
operation. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,141,089 
discloses a swimming pool lift installation for carrying  
 
a wheelchair, wherein seatbelts secured to rails are 
provided for use by a swimmer. Also, U.S. Patent No. 
4,726,730 discloses an assembly for lifting and tilting 
a wheelchair. The wheelchair and its passenger are held  
 
in place by safety belts passing along platform sides 
and over the wheelchair and its occupant. Ricon 
Corporation, Pacoima, California offers wheelchair lifts 
incorporating restraining belts extendable between a 
pair of handrails and barrier plates along the front and 
side edges of the lifts' platform. U.S. Patent No. 
5,026,244 discloses a wheelchair lift having both a 
retention strap, drawn across the front of a wheelchair 
and attached to a handrail, and a barrier plate 
positioned at the front edge of the platform. U.S. Patent No. 5,052,521 discloses a 
stairway lift accommodating either a wheelchair or a 
fixed seat. The lift contains two guard arms lowered 
during operation and three platform flaps raised during 
operation. The distal end of each guard arm is provided 
with an inwardly directed right angle bend, such that a 
rigid, substantially rectangular, outer perimeter is 
formed by the arms in conjunction with the lift's 
vertical
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An assembly for lifting a passenger (10) having a mobile 
platform (14) having a lift surface (30) that is driven to transport 

passengers between different levels, a drive means (16, 114) for 
actuating the platform (14) between the different levels, and including 

a manual switch (82) for controlling the drive means; spaced-apart 
side passenger supports (60, 62, 111, 113) extending above said lift 

surface (30); a restraining belt comprising a buckle (64) connected to 
one of the side passenger supports (60, 111); a strap (68) attached to 

the opposing side passenger support (62, 113) terminating in a tab (70) 
adapted to matingly interlock with the buckle (64), the buckle and the 

strap fixed along the side passenger supports, so that when the buckle 
(64) and tab (70) are matingly interlocked a safety restraint is 

provided for the passenger on the platform (14); 
characterised in that a safety interlock is disposed in the buckle, for 

disabling the manual switch (72) of the actuating means, unless the 
buckle (64) and the tab (70) are interlocked. 
The assembly in accordance with Claim 1, wherein the 
safety interlock comprises a normally open electric switch (73). 
The assembly in accordance with Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the mobile platform (14) is adapted to lift passengers into 

and out of the vehicles. 
The assembly in accordance with Claim 3, wherein the  
 

mobile platform (14) is adapted to lift passengers in wheelchairs. 
The assembly in accordance with Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the mobile platform (14) is adapted to lift passengers between 

floors of a building. 
The assembly in accordance with Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the mobile platform (14) defines a lift surface (30) with a 

front edge (32) and two opposing sides (34) such that the safety 
restraint is formed between the passenger and the front edge (32) of 

the mobile platform (14). 
The assembly in accordance with Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the platform (14) comprises a chair (112) and the restraining 

belt is adapted to cross the lap of a passenger occupying the chair 
(112). 
The assembly in accordance with Claim 7, wherein the 
chair (112) is adapted to lift passengers between floors of a building.
