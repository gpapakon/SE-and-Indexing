<ABSTRACT>
A galvanized and coated roll formed tube (20) has several 
slideway channels (24) formed therein. Edges (40,42) of the sheet material. 

forming the tube are folded back and interlocked in a hook 
arrangement to form a seam (44). The seam is located radially 

inwardly from the inner circumferential surface of the tube, 
preferably on a wall of one of the channels. Strengthening 

ridges (38) are also formed in the tube. The tube is attached to 
an awning and supported at each end by poles or outriggers. 

The awning is also attached to a wall so as to be rollable 
around the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to roll-up awnings for
travel trailers or recreational vehicles, and in particular
to a roller tube which forms the front of the awning assembly.It has long been recognized roll-up awnings have been
useful in the recreational vehicle field. Such awnings are
particularly useful when trailer homes or recreational
vehicles are parked at a campsite. While parked, there is a
need for a protected area in which users may take cover from
inclement weather. A spring-biased, roll-up awning has long
been used in the field.A roll-up awning generally comprises a canopy connected
at one end to the side of the recreational vehicle, and at the
opposite end connected to a roller tube. The roller tube is
pivotally supported by extended arms which are pivotally
mounted to the side of the recreational vehicle. In a stored
position, the canopy is rolled about the roller tube and
secured to the recreational vehicle's side wall. When the
awning is in use, the canopy is unrolled and is supported by
the roller tube which is in turn supported by the extended
side arms. In the unrolled position, the roller tube must not
only support the weight of the canopy, but also the weight of
other attachments (such as a screen or a valance), as well as
resist the forces of nature (such as wind and rain). A roller 
tube, therefore, must be able to resist significant amounts
of both normal force and bending stress.In the past, when the awning was of long span, the roller
tube would sag between its end supports. This situation was
remedied by adding extra supports or by increasing the
strength of the roller tube. One method of increasing the
strength of a roller tube is to fabricate the tube from
extruded aluminum. Extruded aluminum roller tubes have
performed satisfactorily but are expensive to manufacture.
Extruded steel roller tubes are also known in the art.
However, because awnings are usually exposed to the elements,
it is desirable to use steel which is electrogalvanized on
both sides and specially coated for corrosion resistance.
Extrusion does not permit the use of electrogalvanized or
precoated steel. Furthermore, steel extrusion requires a
steel having a lower yield strength than is suitable for
awning support.To reduce costs and improve performance, it is preferable
to roll form the awning tube using a high strength material
which is galvanized and painted prior to forming. Roll
forming of aluminum is possible, but requires a softer and
lower strength aluminum which is not adequate for awning
support

An awning assembly, comprising a roller tube (20)
of rigid sheet material having two longitudinal edges (40,

42) and formed in an elongated, hollow, and generally
cylindrical shape having an inner surface (22) defining a

circumference; a seam (44) comprising the edges being
joined in an interlocking arrangement; and an awning (14)

having first and second ends, the first end being
attachable to a wall or support (12) and the second end

being attached to the roller tube, the awning being
rollable around the roller tube, characterized in that the

seam (44) is disposed radially inwardly from the inner
circumference (22).
An awning assembly according to claim 1, further
comprising a crimp (50) formed in the seam to frictionally

engage surfaces of the seam.
An awning assembly, according to claim 1, further
comprising a pair of hooks (46, 48) disposed at the edges

so as to interlock the edges to form the seam.
An awning assembly according to claim 3, wherein
the hooks comprise the edges of the sheet being folded back

on themselves. 
An awning assembly according to claim 1, further
comprising at least one longitudinal channel formed in the

sheet material of the roller tube.
An awning assembly according to claim 5, wherein
the seam is disposed in the channel.
An awning assembly according to claim 5, wherein
the seam is disposed so as to form a wall of the channel.
An awning assembly according to claim 5, wherein
the channel forms a slideway.
An awning assembly according to claim 8, wherein
the slideway comprises at least one wall formed so as to

define an opening smaller than the channel.
An awning assembly according to claim 9, wherein
the slideway comprises a base wall and two side walls.
An awning assembly according to claim 10, wherein
the seam is disposed on the base wall (32a).
An awning assembly according to claim 8, wherein
the seam is disposed in the slideway.
An awning assembly according to any of the
preceding claims, further comprising a plurality of 

channels formed in the tube and spaced around the tube in
respect of the seam so as to balance the tube during

rolling.
An awning assembly according to any of the
preceding claims, further comprising a plurality of

longitudinal ridges formed in the surface of the tube.
An awning assembly according to claim 1, further
comprising a wall of a vehicle to which the awning is

attached.
An awning assembly according to any of the
preceding claims characterized in that the wall is a wall

of a vehicle (10), the first end of the awning is attached
to said vehicle wall and a support arm (21) extends between

the vehicle and the tube.
A method of forming a roller tube (20) for an
awning, comprising the steps of roll forming a sheet of

rigid material having two generally parallel longitudinal
edges (40, 42) into an elongated, generally cylindrical

tube having an inner surface (22) defining a circumference;
folding the edges back to form hooks (46, 48); and engaging

the hooks in an interlocking arrangement to form a seam
(44) which closes the tube, characterized in that the hooks

(46, 48) are disposed radially inwardly from the inner
circumference (22). 
A method according to claim 17, further
comprising the step of forming a channel in the tube

wherein the seam is located in the channel.
A method according to claim 18, wherein the
channel is formed by bending one edge inwardly; bending the

one edge back outwardly; and bending the other edge

inwardly; and the seam is formed by bending one of the
edges inwardly; folding back the other edge to form a hook;

inserting the one edge into the hook; and folding back the
one edge to form a second hook.
