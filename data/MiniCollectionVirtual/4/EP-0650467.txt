<ABSTRACT>
The invention refers to a method for preparing ceramic mixed oxide materials, particularly intended to be used as matrix material in composite ceramic products, by mixing and co-milling of a metal and a ceramic oxide material and subsequent reaction-sintering in an oxidizing atmosphere. For obtaining an improved homogeneity between metal and oxide materials, the invention suggests that the metal is used in the form of an alloy with an element which is to be present in the final mixed-oxide material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a method for preparing 
ceramic mixed-oxide materials, particularly intended 
to be used as matrix material in composite ceramic 
products, by mixing and co-milling of a metal and a ceramic 
oxide material and subsequent reaction-sintering in an 
oxidizing atmosphere. In the preparation of ceramic oxide materials of 
the kind referred to by mixing and co-milling of a metal 
and a ceramic oxide material and subsequent reaction-sintering 
it has always been desirable to use the metal in a 
particulate form with as small particle size as ever possible. 
Therefore, in many cases it has been attempted to 
use milled aluminium of flake shape. A disadvantage has 
been, however, that said flakes smear and adhere to the 
milling bodies due to the softness of the metal and hence 
also mostly remain in flake shape. See e.g. Nils Claussen 
et al. "Low-shrinkage Reaction-Bonded Alumina", J. Europ. 
Ceram. Soc., 5, 1989, pages 29-35. It might also be 
referred to other articles of and with Nils Claussen and 
his research group such as the international Application WO-A-8909755 or "Tailoring of Reaction-Bonded 
Al2O3 Ceramics", Ceram. Eng. Sci. Proc., 11, pages 806-820, 
1990. Another way to achieve a better homogeneity between 
metal and oxide materials in the present connection 
has been suggested e.g. by the US firm Lanxide Corp., 
Newark, Del., USA and implies that an oxidation of the 
metal is carried out in melted form. See "Formation of 
Lanxide ceramic composite materials", J. Mater. Res., 1, 
1986, pages 81-89. Furthermore it is to be referred to the  
 
Swedish patent No. 8103269-0 which refers to a method in 
preparing shapes of silicon nitride based materials. Since it thus is the fine-division of the metal 
which in most cases constitutes the step which is difficult 
to surmount for achieving the goals aimed at, the 
present invention now suggests a different way of overcoming 
the difficulties and the feature essentially distinguishing 
the present invention is that the metal is 
used in the form of an alloy with an element which is to 
be present in the final oxide material. In this connection 
it is a particular advantage of the invention when the 
element with which the metal is to be alloyed, is selected 
such that the alloy obtained becomes brittle so as to 
facilitate the milling. The subsequent reaction-sintering 
furthermore can be improved by adding a catalyst metal to 
the alloy. Thus the basic idea of the present invention is to 
mill, together with a suitable
