<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the invention is a water-jet propulsion device for ships which are intended for use in shallow waters. A semiaxially bladed rotor (3) with a vertical axis of rotation is rotatably arranged in a well-shaped housing (1). The drive (4) for the rotor (3) is inserted into the housing from above through a cover plate, and the housing is closed at the bottom by a base plate (6) which has a water inlet (7) arranged in the centre for the axial flow towards the rotor (3) and has at least one water outlet (8, 9, 10) inclined at a small angle. Arranged between the discharge end of the feed passages of the rotor (3) and the at least one water outlet is a distributor (5) in which the water delivered by the rotor (3) is fed to the at least one outlet nozzle without the conversion of flow energy into pressure energy. The distributor forms an annular passage without blading. The water inlet (7) is of asymmetrical design. The base plate with water inlet (7) integrated in it and the at least one water outlet (8-10) is endlessly rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the housing (1) in both peripheral directions, either as part of the housing, rotatable as a unit, or relative to the housing, which in the latter case can be part of the supporting structure of the ship.

<CLAIMS>
A water-jet drive for ships, also for use in 
shallow water, wherein a vaned impeller having a 

vertical axis of rotation is rotatably disposed in a 
well-like pressure casing into which the drive for the 

impeller is inserted from above through a cover plate, 
the bottom of the casing being closed by a baseplate 

having at least one water outlet at a small angle and a 
central water outlet for the axial oncoming flow 

towards the impeller, wherein a distributor is disposed 
between the at least one water outlet and the outlet 

end of the delivery ducts of the impeller,
 
characterised in that the distributor has a vaneless 

annular duct between the pressure casing (12) and the 
impeller casing (13) concentrically with the impeller 

axis and in which the flow from the semiaxial 
direction, on leaving the impeller (3), is converted 

into an outlet flow from the distributor, at an angle 
between about 160 and 200Â° to the axial oncoming flow 

against the impeller. 
A water-jet drive according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the annular duct is a ring 

diffuser. 
A water-jet drive according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the cross-section of the annular 

duct is constant or decreases in the direction of flow. 
A water-jet drive according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the outer contour of the annular 

duct is directly determined by the pump casing (12).  
 
A water-jet drive according to any of claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the inner contour of the 

annular duct is directly determined by the impeller 
casing (13). 
A water-jet drive according to any of claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that the annular duct at the 

downflow end terminates in outlet nozzles (8 - 10) 
incorporated in a cover plate (6) of the drive casing. 
A water-jet drive according to any of claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that the pump inlet (7) is 

asymmetrical and disposed preferably in the cover plate 
(7). 
A water-jet drive according to any of claims 1 to 
7, characterised in that the entire drive is pivotable 

around the longitudinal axis or the axis of rotation of 
the impeller (3). 
A water-jet drive according to any of claims 1 - 
8, characterised in that the distributor follows a 

semiaxially vaned impeller (3).
