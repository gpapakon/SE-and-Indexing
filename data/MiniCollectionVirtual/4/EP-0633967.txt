<ABSTRACT>
Injection system for the sealing of joints in concrete structures having joint surfaces arising from stepwise casting of such structures and extending between an outer or upper side (the water pressure side) and an inner or lower side (the dry side), for the purpose of preventing penetration of moisture from the water pressure side. The system comprises a per se known profile (1) having a lengthwise through injection passage (3) with an opening (4, 5) to that side of the profile which is to face the joint surface (6), in combination with a per se known swelling material (8, 9) attached to the profile on that side thereof which is to face the water pressure side of the concrete structure. The swelling material (8, 9) shall be disposed along the full length of the profile (1) and around at least one of the end faces of the profile. The opening (4, 5) from the injection passage (3) may be in the form of a continuous slot (4) opening into a widened portion (5) adapted to receive a porous barrier against the intrusion of concrete mass to the injection passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an injection system for the 
sealing of joints in concrete or similar structures, such 
joints resulting e.g. from stepwise concrete casting. In 
particular, but not exclusively, the invention finds its use 
for the sealing of joints in the transition between a foundation 
sole and a foundation wall. It is commonly known that cracks, crevices etc. may occur in 
concrete structures, in particular in connection with joints 
resulting from stepwise concrete castings. These cracks and 
crevices are, by way of example, caused by lack in homogenity 
or other consistency deficiency in the concrete or as a result 
of the setting shrinkage of the concrete, and may lead to 
penetration of water. In order to repair such crack and crevice damages to the 
concrete and to achieve sealing of the concrete against 
penetration of water, suggestions have been made to effect a 
point by point injection of a sealing material, e.g. in the 
form of a polymer. Other injection materials which may be 
used for this purpose are polyurethanes, epoxies, acryl gels 
and micro-cements. There are also several suggestions for 
injection tubes or hoses which are to be cast-in into the 
concrete to permit a subsequent injection of sealing material 
or which may be placed along a joint face of an already cast 
section of the structure, e.g. on a foundation sole, prior to 
the casting of the subsequent section, e.g. a foundation wall. 
Examples of such injection tubes or hoses are disclosed in US 
4.449.713 and 4.499.925, EP 0.125.696 and 0.501.004 and 
WO-A-9 216 696.  
 The present invention is aimed at an injection system for the 
sealing of joints in concrete structures having joint surfaces 
arising from stepwise casting of such structures and extending 
between an outer or upper side which may be under water 
pressure and an inner or lower side, for the purpose of 
preventing penetration of moisture from the water pressure 
side, whereby the placing of the system becomes substantially 
simpler and safer and whereby the effect becomes substantially 
enhanced. The characteristic features of the injection system 
of the invention are primarily that it comprises 
a) a longitudinal profile having a lengthwise injection 
passage therethrough which opens to that side of the profile 
which is to face the joint surface, in combination with b) a per se known swelling material attached to the profile 
on that side thereof which is to face the water pressure 
side of the concrete structure, and that c) the

Injection system for the sealing of joints in concrete 
structures having joint surfaces arising from stepwise casting 

of such structures and extending between an outer or upper 
side which may be under water pressure and an inner or lower 

side, for the purpose of preventing penetration of moisture 
from the water pressure side, characterised in that it 

comprises 

a) a longitudinal profile (1) having a lengthwise 
injection passage (3) therethrough which opens (at 4,5) to that side 

of the profile which is to face the joint surface (6), in 
combination with 
b) a per se known swelling material (8,9) attached to the 
profile on that side thereof which is to face the water 

pressure side of the concrete structure, and that 
c) the swelling material (8,9) is disposed along the full 
length of the profile (1) and around at least one of the 

end faces of the profile. 
Injection system according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the opening (4,5) from the injection passage (3) is in 

the form of a continuous slot (4) opening into a widened 
portion (5) adapted to receive a porous barrier against the 

intrusion of concrete mass to the injection passage. 
Injection system according to claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the profile (1), on that side thereof 

which is to face the joint surface (6), is provided with a lip 
or flange (7). 
Injection system according to claim 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the profile (1) on that side thereof which is to face 

away from the joint surface (6) and on that side which is to 
face towards the water pressure side of the concrete structure, 

is provided with a lip or flange (10) for the protection 
of the swelling material (8,9) against mechanical influence 

from above.
