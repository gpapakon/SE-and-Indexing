<ABSTRACT>
The equipment allows heavy loads to be handled from a carrying vehicle. The latter receives two jibs (7) located on either side and laterally on the carrier, each jib being articulated to a mast (8) with the aid of a lifting ram (11). The jibs, via their upper part, allow the movement of load-translating travellers (13), these travellers being associated with carrying means (MP) capable of raising the load. The carrying means surround the load and comprise balance arms (P) which receive means for taking hold of and gripping the said load. The carrying means are capable of pivoting through 90@ relative to their loading/unloading position on the carrier in order to assume a position between the jibs, when the carrying vehicle is running around empty.
