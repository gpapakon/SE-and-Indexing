<ABSTRACT>
An enantiomer of a fused ring system compound is disclosed that contains an epoxide group on one side of the fused rings and an enediyne macrocyclic ring on the other side of the fused rings. The enantiomeric compounds have DNA-cleaving, antimicrobial and tumor growth-inhibiting properties that are enhanced over their racemates. Chimeric compounds having the enantiomeric fused ring system compound as an aglycone bonded to (i) a sugar moiety as the oligosaccharide portion or (ii) a monoclonal antibody or antibody combining site portion thereof that immunoreacts with target tumor cells are also disclosed. Compositions containing an enatiomeric compound or an enantiomeric chimer are disclosed, as are methods of preparing an enantiomeric compound.

ENANTIOMERIC DYNEMICIN ANALOGS, PREPARATION AND USE THEREOFDescriptionTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to novel DNA- cleaving, c totoxic and anti-tumor compounds, and particularly to enantiomeric fused ring compound systems that contain an enediyne macrocyclic ring and also an epoxide ring, as well as chimeras that contain such a fused ring compound system.Background Art Dynemicin A (Compound 1 shown below) ,where Me is methyl, is a potent antibacterial and anticancer agent recently isolated from Micromonospora chersina [(a) Konishi et. al, J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 112:3715-3716 (1990); (b) Konishi et al., J. Antibiot.. 42.:1449-1452 (1989)]. Its striking molecular structure combines characteristics of both the enediyne [Golik et al., J. Am.
