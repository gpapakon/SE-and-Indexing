<ABSTRACT>
An information processing apparatus has a 
plurality of computational nodes. Each computational 

node is provided with at least one wavelength 
multiplexer for multiplexing signals of a plurality of 

wavelengths and simultaneously transmitting the 
multiplexed signals and at least one wavelength 

demultiplexer for demultiplexing the transmitted 
signals in the plurality of wavelengths. The apparatus 

further comprises a concentrator connected through a 
transmission line medium with each of the plurality of 

computational nodes. The concentrator includes a 
wavelength demultiplexer for demultiplexing the signals 

of the plurality of wavelengths transmitted through the 
wavelength multiplexer from each of the plurality of 

computational nodes; a wavelength multiplexer for 
multiplexing signals of the plurality of wavelengths 

and simultaneously transmitting the multiplexed signals 
to each of the plurality of computational nodes; a 

connector for connection of a signal for data transfer 
between the plurality of computational nodes connected 

with each other; and an arbiter for performing an 
arbitration operation for use of the transmission line 

in the data transfer. A signal for arbitration for use 
of the transmission line transmitted between the 

computational nodes and the arbiter and the signal for 
data transfer between the computational nodes are  

 
transmitted in a multiplexed manner on the transfer 

line medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates mainly to an 
information processing apparatus such as a parallel 
computer system consisting of a plurality of 
computational nodes interconnected in a star-shaped 
configuration using a star coupler. There are two conventional methods for each 
computational node to use an interconnected network in 
a parallel computer system employing the star-shaped 
topology for the interconnected network: a method 
without performing an arbitration operation (or without 
providing an arbiter), in which individual 
computational nodes each check circumstances of use of 
transmission line (whether it is open or not), and a 
node uses the transmission line if it is open, but 
continues checking whether any collision is caused in 
the transmission line, if it is in use; or a method 
with an arbiter, in which a signal line for arbitration 
in the interconnecting network is stretched between 
each computational node and the arbiter, the arbiter 
performs arbitration to avoid any collision in the  
 
transmission line in response to requests for use of 
the interconnecting network from the individual 
computational nodes, and the computational nodes each 
use the transmission line, based on authorization of 
use from the arbiter. Among the above conventional examples, the 
method without an arbiter, however, needed means for 
checking if the transmission line is open or not, means 
for detecting occurrence of collision, recovery means 
in detection of collision, etc., which caused a 
drawback that processing or apparatus became complex. On the other hand, the method with an arbiter 
for arbitration had a problem in respect of the number 
of connecting lines between the computational nodes and 
the arbiter. Especially in the case of the star-shaped 
interconnecting network, the arbiter was normally 
located at the center of connecting network and 
therefore signal lines for arbitration and signal lines 
for actual data transfer were needed between the 
individual computational nodes and the center of 
connection network, which increased the number of 
connection lines. In order to avoid an increase in 
number of connection lines, there is a method employing 
the packet transmission method for data transfer, 
thereby reducing the number of signal lines (connection 
lines) for actual data transfer. Even with this 
method, double interconnections for data transfer and  
 
for arbitration were required between the respective 
computational nodes and the center of connection 
network. For solving
