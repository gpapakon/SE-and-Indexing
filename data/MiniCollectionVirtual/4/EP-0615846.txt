<ABSTRACT>
Described is an ink jet recording apparatus which includes a 
recording head (7) communicated via an ink supply needle (9) 

with an ink tank (120) and including electrodes (130,131) for 
detecting a remaining amount of ink and being responsive to a 

print signal for spouting ink drops to recording paper, a 
capping unit (80) abutting against the front of said 

recording head (7) for holding the nozzle openings in an 
airtight state, and a suction pump (13) for supplying 

negative pressure to the capping unit (80). The apparatus 
further comprising a resistance value detection circuit for 

detecting electric resistance across the electrodes (130,131) 
for detecting a remaining amount of ink, a reference value 

storage unit for storing a resistance value across the 
electrodes (130,131) relative to the remaining amount of ink 

in the ink tank, a resistance value comparison unit for 
comparing the resistance across the electrodes (130,131) with 

the reference value, and a pump control unit responsive to 
the resistance value comparison result for controlling a 

pulse motor driving the suction pump (13). The resistance 
value detected by the resistance value detection circuit is 

compared with the reference value stored in the reference 
value storage unit to determine whether or not an ink tank is 

mounted, remounted, how much ink is in the ink tank, etc. 
Based on the determination result, the motor is controlled by 

the pump control unit for selecting the suction mode of ink 
from the recording head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet recording 
apparatus. An on-demand ink jet recording apparatus which jets ink 
pressurized at a pressure generation chamber through a nozzle 
onto recording paper as ink droplets for recording print data 
exhibits substantial problems. Among these problems are a rise 
in viscosity caused by evaporation of an ink solvent from 
nozzle openings and print failure caused by drying of ink, 
adhesion of dust, and mixing of air bubbles. Thus, an ink jet 
recording apparatus of this type is generally provided with a 
capping device for sealing the nozzle openings when no printing 
is being performed and a device for cleaning around the nozzle 
openings as required. A proposed capping device includes a slider which is moved 
by a carriage to a home position along a slant guide face 
disposed on a frame to the nozzle opening face side of a head, 
and a cap disposed on the surface of the slider is pressed 
against the recording head for sealing the nozzle openings, for 
example. Such an arrangement is disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open No. Hei 1-125239.  
 For such an ink jet recording apparatus, an ink tank is 
furnished in cartridge form which provides a convenient ink 
supply. When the ink has been consumed, the ink cartridge is 
replaced with a new one. One such ink cartridge is disclosed 
in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 2-187364, in which a 
porous substance forming an ink absorber is housed in the ink 
cartridge. Annular packing material is disposed on the tip of 
an ink outlet for sealing. Since ink can be easily supplied by 
simply changing ink cartridges, the ink cartridge is very 
useful in preventing pollution caused by ink leakage, etc., at 
the ink supply. On the other hand, the ink cartridge has a 
disadvantage in that air bubbles are prone to enter the ink 
cartridge by piston action between an ink supply needle on the 
main unit side and the ink outlet of the ink cartridge when the 
ink supply needle is inserted. Further, because of the ease of changing the ink supply, 
the ink cartridge is prone to be removed and then remounted even when ink 
remains in the cartridge. As a result, air bubbles enter the 
ink cartridge by the piston action and cause print failure to 
occur. Document EP-A-0 452 119 discloses an ink jet recording apparatus with a 
recording head, capping means for abutting against a front of the recording head and 
suction means for supplying negative pressure to the capping means. It is therefore an object of the invention to
