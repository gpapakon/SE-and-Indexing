<ABSTRACT>
In a broad form, the 
invention comprises illuminating a selected portion of the cornea, 

moving a slit across the cornea and generating Tyndall image ray 
paths for enabling analysis of the optical density of the cornea 

and the thickness of the cornea. This is accomplished through a 
series of digitally-encoded television images of the optical 

section of the cornea produced by a multiple slit projector and 
which images are then subjected to digital analysis. A locus of 

each of the significant elements of the reflected image of the 
anterior portion of the eye is defined. In this way, the optical 

character of the cornea/air interface is compared with the 
corrected reflectance of the stroma and the endothelium, in order 

to determine relative transparency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to certain new and useful
improvements in ophthalmic pachymeters for aiding in the
determination of the thickness and relative optical density of the
cornea of the eye on a real-time basis.Planning for anterior segment surgery is a topic which has
received increasing attention in recent years, as, for example, in
a paper by Lehrman, et al., "Measurement of Anterior Chamber
Diameter" and "Biometry of Anterior Segment by Scheimpflug Slit
Lamp Photography", reported in Investigative Ophthalmology and
Visual Science, Volume 32, No. 3, March 1991, pages 529-532.The slit lamp is an instrument employed by many optometrists
and ophthalmologists for examination of the anterior portion of the
eye. Many different versions of the instrument have been produced
over the last century, but all of the slit lamps have three major
elements in common and which include a projector for providing a
collimated image of an optical slit focused on the eye, a bio-microscope
or camera for viewing the image and a mechanical support
system. In this slit lamp system, the bio-microscope or camera is
designed to view the image formed by the projector and is confocal
with the projector. The mechanical support system must be
elaborate to at least support the subject and the projector and
viewing system. Furthermore, the elements must be positioned 
relative to one another for appropriate examination of the eye.Pachymetry attachments are available for the slit lamp to be
used in clinical environments. These attachments operate so as to
displace half the image by a plane parallel glass block interposed
in the viewing path. In this way, corneal thickness is measured at
a single point. The reading of the drum forming part of this
attachment is then recorded by hand as the local corneal thickness.
While these modified forms of slit lamps, which operate as
pachymeters, can accurately define corneal thickness at an unknown
location, they are slow, expensive and fragile. Moreover, they are
quite difficult to operate, and require substantial training on the
part of the operator. One of the principle problems in the prior art was the fact
that it was not possible to accurately measure various
physical parameters of the cornea, such as depth of tissue
in the cornea and the like, without invasive techniques. As
a simple example, it was very difficult to accurately
measure a distance between a first surface of eye tissue
and a second surface of an eye tissue.Therefore, the present invention has the principle object
to
