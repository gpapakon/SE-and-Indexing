<ABSTRACT>
Radiation and peroxide-curable oligomeric emulsions are 
prepared by mixing water, an α, β-ethylenically unsaturated oligomer 

(e.g. an unsaturated polyester), a reactive, nonionic surfactant 
containing allyl unsaturation, and a metallic salt drier under high 

shear agitation until a stable emulsion is formed. Coatings prepared 
from these emulsions are tack and mar free and demonstrate good 

resistance to organic solvents and water.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coating systems. In one aspect, the
invention relates to coating systems based on α, β-ethylenically
unsaturated oligomers while in another aspect, the invention relates
to such systems in an emulsified form. In yet another aspect, the
invention relates to such emulsified systems comprising a nonionic
surfactant containing allyl unsaturation.The increasing demand for coating systems with reduced
volatile organic compounds (VOC) have brought radiation and
peroxide curable coatings to the forefront. These systems can be
formulated with little, if any, solvent, and they cure rapidly to form
highly crosslinked polymeric structures.The resins commonly used in radiation and peroxide curable
coatings are low to medium molecular weight unsaturated polyesters,
and acrylate and methacrylate esters of polyethers, polyesters,
epoxies and polyurethanes. In order to render these relatively viscous
oligomers suitable for application by conventional coatings
techniques, they are diluted in low viscosity reactive monomers such
as trimethylolpropane triacrylate, 1,6-hexanedioldiacrylate, N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone,
tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate, ethyleneglycol
dimethacrylate, styrene, and the like.Peroxide and radiation curable coatings suitable for roll coater
or spray application usually contain from about 30 to 60 percent by
weight of such reactive diluent monomers to achieve sufficiently low
viscosities for application of a smooth film. However, since monomer-diluted
coatings undergo, relative to solvent-diluted coatings, little
volume reduction through evaporation, it is difficult to achieve very
thin films with conventional application equipment, e.g. films with a
thickness of less than about 12.7 µm.Such large amounts of reactive monomer generally result in a
reduction in a cure rate, decrease in physical properties of the cured
film, unpleasant odor, and an increase in toxicity of the coating.Many of the most effective monomers for reducing viscosity and
maintaining good film integrity have the highest levels of toxicity.
Higher molecular weight monomers with higher reactive group
content have less effect on rate of cure and film properties, but do
little for reducing viscosity. The replacement of reactive monomer with water offers a route
to lower viscosity, reduced odor, rapid cure and better film
properties.Water-soluble oligomers containing hydrophilic groups such as
polyethylene glycol or neutralized acidic groups achieve some of the
above-mentioned goals, but are inherently water
