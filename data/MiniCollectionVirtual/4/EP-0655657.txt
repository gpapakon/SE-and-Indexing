<ABSTRACT>
A toner in which a small amount of magnetic powder 
is disposed in a resin medium for fixing which comprises 

a cationic polar group-containing copolymer resin or a 
resin composition. A distinguished feature resides in 

that the toner does not contain a charge control agent. 
The toner is positively charged and exhibits very good 

spent resistance. The toner further exhibits favorable 
electrophotographic properties such as transfer 

efficiency despite there is contained no charge control 

agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
positively-charging toner for a two-component-type 
magnetic developing agent having excellent spent 
resistance. More specifically, the invention relates to 
a toner which contains no charge control agent, does not 
scatter during the developing, enables the image to be 
efficiently transferred, makes it possible to form image 
of a high density, and helps extend the life of the 
toner and the carrier. A so-called two-component-type magnetic developing 
agent has been extensively used for developing 
electrostatic charge image formed on an 
electrophotosensitive material. The two-component-type magnetic developing agent 
comprises a composition of a magnetic carrier of an iron 
powder or ferrite grains and an electroscopic toner 
composed of a coloring resin composition. To carry out 
the developing, the magnetic carrier and the toner are 
mixed together to electrically charge the toner grains 
to a predetermined polarity, the mixture is carried to 
the photosensitive material in the form of a magnetic 
brush, the surface of the photosensitive material is 
rubbed by the magnetic brush, and the electrically 
charged toner is adsorbed and held by the charge image 
on the surface of the photosensitive material to form a 
visible image. A charge control agent is usually contained in the 
toner grains in order to control the polarity of the 
toner gains by frictional charging. A negative charge  
 
control agent such as a metal-containing complex salt 
dyestuff or a metal complex of oxycarboxylic acid is 
used for the negatively-charging toner (e.g., see 
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 67268/1991), 
and a positive charge control agent such as an 
oil-soluble dyestuff like Nigrosine or an amine control 
agent is used for the positively-charging toner (e.g., 
see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 
106249/1981). It has long been known to use a magnetic toner as a 
toner for the two-component-type magnetic developing 
agent. For instance, the above Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publication No. 106249/1981 and Japanese 
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 162563/1984 disclose a 
magnetic powder-containing toner which contains a 
magnetic powder therein. The above Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publication No. 67268/1991 discloses a magnetic 
powder-carrying toner obtained by adding and mixing a 
silica powder and a magnetic powder to the toner. It has been known that the two-component-type 
magnetic developing agent exhibits satisfactory 
electrically charging
