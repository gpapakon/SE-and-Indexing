<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for producing TiO₂ by reacting O₂ and 
TiCl₄ in a reactor tube wherein pressure fluctuations in the flow 

of fluids through the reactor tube are sensed and output signals 
are generated proportional to the sensed pressure fluctuations. 

The flow of at least one of the TiCl₄ or O₂ is then varied through 
the reactor tube in response to predetermined pressure fluctuations 

so as to increase the efficiency of the reaction between TiCl₄ and 
the O₂. The efficiency of the reaction between O₂ and TiCl₄ in the 

reactor tube is achieved by a control apparatus operably connected 
to the reactor assembly which is capable of monitoring pressure 

fluctuations in TCl₄ and O₂ through the reactor assembly so that the 
flow of at least one of the TiCl₄ or O₂ can be varied in response 

to predetermined pressure fluctuations. The control apparatus 
includes a sensor assembly, a signal conditioning unit and a signal 

processing unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of TiO2, and
more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to a method and
apparatus for monitoring and controlling pressure fluctuations of
fluids in a reactor vessel during formation of TiO2.In the production of titanium dioxide (TiO2), heated titanium
tetrachloride (TiCl4) and heated oxygen (O2) are combined in a
reactor vessel, commonly referred to as an "oxidizer". A portion
of the operating procedure heretofore employed in the production of
titanium dioxide has been to adjust the flow rate of reactants
until "flutter" sounds are heard by the operator and then to
increase the flow rate by a small amount for the production run."Flutter" is a descriptive word used in the burner art to
denote sounds of uneven combustion. This term was established
years ago when burners produced audible chugging sounds. While
modern burners are relatively quiet in operation, the term is still
used but "flutter" now refers to roughness and/or fizzing sounds
produced in a burner assembly. Flutter also is used to refer to
the fluttering motion on the pointer of a pressure gauge located at
the upstream end of a burner assembly or reactor vessel. In the production of titanium dioxide, the current
process is to tune the reactor in response to sounds that the
operator hears as to "flutter". While this procedure is
workable, it is not very accurate because flutter detection
is a "learned" procedure that requires subjective evaluations
of subtle differences between normal and abnormal reactor
sounds.Because of the difficulty in flutter detection in
modern reactors, attempts have been made to sense the flutter
of the reactor with a microphone, for example, located near
the reactor. The signal from the microphone is amplified and
conditioned by an audio equalizer and then sent to the
control room. Another approach proposed in the prior art is
to display the sound spectrum on a computer screen. However,
the use of the microphone and the sound spectrum have been
only marginally acceptable because the results are generally
inconclusive. Thus, a need still exists for a system capable
of detecting and monitoring the flutter of modern reactors
which is not dependent on the subjective evaluations of the
operator between normal and abnormal reactor sounds. It is
to such a system that the present invention is directed.According to one aspect of the present invention, there
is provided a method for producing TiO2 by reacting O2 and
TiCl4 in a reactor tube, which includes providing a flow
