<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a moulded multilayered product, in particular an internal liner for motor vehicles. The multilayered product (1) has a substantially rigid supporting film (2) of thermoplastic material. This is covered at least on one side, preferably on both sides, with a surface covering (3, 4) in the form of a nonwoven fabric. In this arrangement, the bonding between the nonwoven fabric and the plastic film is a thermal adhesive bond. For forming the adhesive bond, the nonwoven fabric consists at least partly, preferably completely, of a plastic of a similar type to that of the film. The invention also relates to a method and an apparatus for producing the multilayered product. For forming the adhesive bond, the film is heated on at least one side to a temperature in the adhering range of the thermoplastic material, the interior of the film being kept at a lower temperature level. By proceeding in this way, the structure of the nonwoven fabric is not damaged during the adhering and shaping operation. The invention allows single-type multilayered products to be produced in a simple way, so that they can be easily recycled again in their entirety, as can the pieces of scrap occurring during their production.

Internal lining part for motor vehicles in the form of a shaped laminate
(1), with a support layer (2) formed from a substantially stiff,

extruded sheet of polypropylene and at least one surface layer (3, 4) of a
textile fabric, characterized in that fibres of at least one surface layer

(3, 4) at least partly comprise a thermoplastic material of substantially
the same type as the sheet (2) and the surface layer (3, 4) is joined to

the sheet (2) by thermal bonding of said fibres, and that at least one side
of the sheet is covered in full surface manner with an open-pore layer (5)

of a thin web material serving as a support web, shaped in accordance with
the sheet (2) and the at least one textile surface layer (3, 4).
Internal lining part according to claim 1, characterized in that two
textile surface layers (3, 4) are provided, both of which are preferably

joined by thermal bonding to the sheet.
Internal lining part according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
at least one surface layer (3, 4), particularly a decorative layer (3), is

made from substantially the same material as the sheet and in particular
from polypropylene.
Internal lining part according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that it is made from materials compatible with one another with

respect to recycling.
Internal lining part according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the sheet (2) and at least one surface layer (3, 4) are

made from thermoplastic polymers, which on melting the sheet, particularly
during reprocessing, are able to form a common melt.
Internal lining part according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that it has a substantially type-pure structure.
Internal lining part according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that at least one surface layer (4'), particularly a backing, is

at least partly and preferably mainly made from fibres, which are not
fusible with the material of the sheet (2), the surface layer (4') having a 

proportion of fibres made from the same type of material as the sheet
adequate for thermal bonding, the fibres suitable for thermal bonding to

the sheet (2) preferably being present in larger numbers in the side of the
surface layer facing the sheet.
Internal lining part according to one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that the layer (5) of the web material is placed between the
surface layer (3), particularly a backing, and the sheet (2) and is preferably

so thin and the pore width so large that the adhesive bond between
the sheet (2) and surface layer (3) penetrates the pores of the layer (5).
Internal lining part according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the web material (5) is formed by a hidden supporting web,

which remains in the laminate (1).
Internal lining part according to one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the sheet (2) has, at least on surface areas, perforations

(7) and preferably at least one surface layer (3, 4) is free from perforations
and covers the perforations (7) of the sheet (2).
Internal lining part according to claim 10, characterized in that the
perforations (7) are deformed as a function of the deformation of the sheet

(2).
Internal lining part according to one of the claims 10 or 11, characterized
in that the perforations (7) are provided on those areas of the

sheet (2), which cover cavities suitable for sound absorption.
Process for the production of an internal lining part for motor
vehicles in the form of a shaped laminate with a support layer of a substantially

stiff, extruded polypropylene sheet and at least one surface
layer of a textile fabric by joining and shaping at elevated temperature,

particularly according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that a polypropylene sheet web having on at least one surface a temperature

in the tackiness range and in the interior a lower temperature in the range
of the plastic deformability of the thermoplastic material is covered on 

at least one side in full surface manner with an open-pore layer of a thin
web material serving as a support web, is joined to at least one textile

surface layer of substantially the same thermoplastic material as the sheet
by bonding, the temperature level in the interior being utilized for deforming

the sheet.
Process according to claim 13, characterized in that at least one
surface of a firm sheet web of polypropylene is brought by surface heating

to a surface temperature in the tackiness range of the polypropylene in
such a way that the temperature in the interior of the sheet does not

significantly exceed the temperature necessary for the plastic deformation
of the sheet.
Process according to claim 13 or 14, characterized in that as the
surface layer use is made of a textile fabric, particularly a needle web,

whose fibres are at least partly formed from a similar type of plastic to
the sheet, the melting range of the plastics being substantially the same.
