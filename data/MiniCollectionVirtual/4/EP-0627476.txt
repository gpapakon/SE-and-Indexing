<ABSTRACT>
A photopolymerization initiator for a visible ray polymerizable adhesive, and a visible ray polymerizable 
adhesive comprising the initiator, an aliphatic tertiary amine and a radical-polymerizable monomer. The adhesive has 

a good adhesiveness, a good transparency free from discoloration after photopolymerization, and such an excellent 
light resistance that it is minimized in the discoloration and deterioration in the ultraviolet radiation test. The adhesive 

is also excellent in the photopolymerizability by not only visible rays but also near-ultraviolet rays and is minimized 
in the problem of the transparency being impaired by coloration or discoloration when irradiated with either of the 

rays.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photopolymerizing
adhesive which polymerizes when visible light is irradiated,
and to a photopolymerization initiator therefor. More
specifically, the invention relates to the adhesive having
such an excellent photopolymerizing activity as
polymerizability for a short time by irradiation of visible
light; excellent, colorless and transparent appearance after
photopolymerization; and excellent light resistance after
adhesion.Conventionally, as photopolymerizing adhesives
ultraviolet light(UV)-polymerizing ones were used, which were
obtained by adding a UV polymerization initiator that
generates free radicals by absorbing UV, such as
benzoinalkylether, 1-cyclohexylphenylketone, to a
polyfunctional radical polymerizing monomer (e.g., 1, 6-hexanedioldi(meth)acrylate,
bisphenol-A-epoxy modified
di(meth)acrylate), or a monofunctional radical polymerizing
monomer (e.g., N-vinylpyrrolidone
hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate).The UV-polymerizing adhesives are usually one-liquid
type, and show a long pot life and such a practical adhesive
property as polymerizability by irradiation of UV for a short
time, e.g., a few minutes. Accordingly, they are excellent
in handling and in adaptation to a prompt adhering operation 
so that they have been widely used in replace of adhesives
such as epoxy resin adhesives which require mixing a main
agent with a curing one or heating at an adhesion step.Lately, however, fast and simple adhesion as obtainable
by conventional photopolymerizing adhesives has been
increasingly required for opaque materials and UV-absorbing
materials such as colored glass, ceramics, polycarbonates and
polyvinyl chloride.Furthermore, it has been pointed out that UV so far used
for polymerization of conventional photopolymerizing
adhesives has problems. One problem is that UV has a strong
chemical action against a human body and causes danger at
work. The other problem is that UV ray apparatus must have
facilities such as a specialized power supply and exhausting
duct. This will require much cost and make the scale of the
facilities bigger. Thus, photopolymerizing adhesives have
been increasingly expected which can be polymerized by a
safer and simpler light source.Recently, a new type visible light-polymerizing
adhesive, which polymerizes by using visible light, has been
used as a photopolymerizing adhesive which meets the above
purposes.As this adhesive, for example, an adhesive comprising at
least one ketone selected from fluorenone and diketone and at
least one organic
