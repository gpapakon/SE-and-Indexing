<ABSTRACT>
Method for storing a coolant fluid (1) comprising two phases (1a, 1b) of one and the same substance in melting equilibrium, according to which the said fluid is arranged in a storage enclosure (2), in which the coolant fluid stored settles into a liquid lower layer (1b) and a solid upper layer (1a), the coolant fluid to be stored is introduced (3) into the enclosure (2) at the level of the lower layer (1b) and the coolant fluid to be removed from storage is extracted (4) from the enclosure at the level of the upper layer (1a), characterised in that, in combination, on the one hand, a gaseous atmosphere (6) is established between the upper layer (1a) and the upper wall of the enclosure (2) and, on the other hand, the coolant fluid to be removed from storage is extracted from a withdrawal zone (8) located at the level of the interface between the upper layer (1a) and the gaseous atmosphere (6) by a vertical flow (7), with generation of a vortex.

Method for storing a coolant fluid (1) comprising 
two phases (1
a
, 1
b
) of one and the same substance in 
melting equilibrium, according to which: 


a thermally isolated enclosure (2) for storing the 
said fluid is used, in which the coolant fluid 

stored settles into a lower, relatively liquid, 
layer (1
b
) and an upper, relatively solid, layer 
(1
a
); 
the coolant fluid to be stored is introduced into 
the enclosure (2); 
a gaseous headspace (6) is set up between the upper 
layer (1
a
) and the upper wall of the enclosure (2); 
and the coolant fluid to be removed from storage is 
extracted from a withdrawal zone located in the 

storage enclosure at the level of the upper layer 
(1
a
); 
 
characterized in that a cone (8) for pouring out the 

coolant fluid stored is made, within the enclosure and at 
the level of the withdrawal zone, and an ascending or 

descending vertical flow of the fluid to be removed from 
storage is formed, starting from the pouring cone, thus 

generating agitation or turbulence in the coolant fluid 
extracted, at the location where said fluid is drawn off. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the coolant fluid to be removed from storage is 

extracted by at least one of the following vertical flow 
modes, namely upward suction and downward descent of said 

fluid. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that after having introduced the coolant fluid to be 

stored in the enclosure (2), this fluid is directed 
vertically and it is distributed in a plurality of 

horizontally and/or vertically directed jets. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the gaseous atmosphere present in the gaseous 

headspace (6) is recycled into the storage enclosure (2), 
at least at the level of the lower layer (1
b
). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in  
 

that the gaseous atmosphere present in the gaseous 
headspace (6) is recycled into the storage enclosure (2), 

on several staged levels (151, 152, 153) in the 
enclosure. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the coolant fluid is recycled into the storage 

enclosure (2) and, for this purpose, said fluid is 
withdrawn at the level of the lower layer (1
b
), the fluid 
withdrawn is cooled outside the enclosure (2), and the 

cooled coolant fluid is reintroduced into the storage 
enclosure at the level of the upper layer (1
a
). 
Device for storing a coolant fluid (1) comprising 
two phases (1
a
, 1
b
) of one and the same substance in 
melting equilibrium including: 


a thermally isolated storage container (2) forming 
a storage enclosure for said fluid; 
a means (3) for introducing the coolant fluid to be 
stored; 
a means (4) for extracting the coolant fluid to be 
removed from storage, at a level located in height 

at the upper part of the container; 
 
characterized in that in combination, on the one hand a 

gas source (5) is associated with the container for 
setting up a gaseous headspace (6) at the upper part of 

said container and, on the other hand, the extraction 
means (4) is arranged vertically inside the container, 

and comprises a vertical pipe (7) ending in a pouring 
cone (8) for the coolant fluid stored, capable of 

agitating said fluid or making it turbulent when it is 
drawn off. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the means (4) for extracting the coolant fluid to be 

removed from storage comprises an agitation means (9) 
acting inside the pouring cone. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the means (3) for introducing the coolant fluid to 

be stored comprises a vertical pipe (10) ending at the 
upper part of the container in a means (11) for ejecting 

the said fluid.  
 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the means (11) for ejecting the coolant fluid to be 

stored comprises a boom (11

nozzles (12) for ejecting the coolant fluid, in a 
horizontal and/or vertical direction. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in
