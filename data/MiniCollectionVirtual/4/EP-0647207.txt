<ABSTRACT>
High temperature superconductors (e.g. Y-Ba-Cu-O) can be formed at commercial quantities with high phase purities by conducting the coprecipitation process at a constant pH. By selecting a precipitate (e.g. oxalates) which confers plastic properties to the precipitated product, a variety of shaped HTSC compounds can be made.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE SUPERCONDUCTINGOXIDESBY COPRECIPITAΗONAT CONSTANTPH.FIELD OF THE INVENTION THIS INVENTION relates to superconductors and particularly high temperature superconductors and to an improved preparation of high temperature superconductors and fabrication of articles containing high temperature superconductors. BACKGROUND ARTHigh temperature superconductors were first disclosed in 1987 and are characterised by having superconductor transition temperatures (Tc) above the temperature of liquid helium and many with a Tc above the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77.3K). The three broad families of high temperature superconductors (HTSC) are as follows -(i) the Y-Ba-Cu-0 system (ii) the Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-0 system; and (iϋ) the Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-0 system.The system (i) which is reported in Phys. Rev.Lett. !5£J 405 (1987) is easy to synthesise and has a wide composition range over which superconductivity may appear. It has a relatively low Tc which is approximately 90°K.System (ii) does not contain rare earth elements and has a high Tc which is approximately 108K.However it has a narrow composition range which permits superconductivity. System (ii) is reported in Japan J. Appl. Phys 27 L 1041 (1988).System (iii) which is reported in Nature 332 138 (1988) has a high Tc which is approximately 120K but the toxicity of thallium is of concern.Other high temperature conducting systems include -(a) The 214 system, ie. (La,Ba)2Cu04(b) 124(YBa2Cu408) and 247 (Y2Ba4Cu7015) 

(c) The Bi2Sr2Cu06 (CaCu02)n (N=0,l,2) system and its variants with Pb stabilisation(d) The Tl2Ba2CuO6(CaCuO2)n(n=0,1,2,3) system(e) The (Nd,Ce)2Cu04 system and its variants. The two main techniques to form HTSC are grinding the respective HTSC precursors together or solution co-precipitation of the respective HTSC precursors.Grinding HTSC precursors is a lengthy process and requires several grinding and sorting stages to obtain a particle size distribution and mix which will be suitable for formation of the HTSC. However, it is difficult to obtain phase purity and repeatable results. Phase purity is critical in the efficiency of the HTSCs and with many HTSC families, even slight variations from the correct ratio of the various components will result in loss or degradation of HTSC properties.Solution co-precipitation is a technique to prepare precursor (for example of HTSC compounds) compounds so that they are mixed in a very intimate manner, perhaps as closely as on a molecular level. In solution co-precipitation, the various precursor components are
