<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
production of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (to be referred to as
"FBP" hereinafter).In the living body, glucose metabolism is effected by
the glycolytic pathway in which an enzyme called
phosphofructokinase (E.C. 2.7.1.11) (to be referred to as
"PFK 1" hereinafter) plays an important role as a regulatory
factor. FBP is a factor which directly activates PFK 1, and
carbohydrate metabolism is regulated by the activation of PFK
1. Thus, it has been confirmed in recent years that FBP
plays an important role in the living body as a carbohydrate
metabolism-related factor.In general, FBP is produced either by organic
synthesis or enzymatic synthesis. In the organic synthesis
process, FBP is produced, for example, by firstly
synthesizing fructose 1,2-cyclic, 6-bisphosphate (to be
referred to as "FCP" hereinafter) from a starting material,
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (to be referred to as "FDP"
hereinafter), using dicyclohexyl carbodiimide as a catalyst.
The thus synthesized FCP is subjected to partial alkali
hydrolysis to form FBP (E. Van Schaftingen and H. G. Hers,
European Journal of Biochemistry, vol.117, p.319, 1981; K. 
Uyeda, E. Fruya and A. D. Sherry, Journal of Biological
Chemistry, vol.256, p.8679, 1981; and JP-A-60-161994). The
term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published
Japanese patent application". As an example of the enzymatic
synthesis method, E. Fruya and K. Uyeda (Journal of
Biological Chemistry, vol.256, p.7109, 1981) disclose a
process in which FBP is produced from fructose 6-phosphate
(to be referred to as "F6P" hereinafter) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate
(to be referred to as "ATP" hereinafter) by the
action of fructose 6-phosphate 2-kinase (E.C. 2.7.1.105) (to
be referred to as "PFK 2" hereinafter).With regard to a process for the isolation of FBP,
the present inventors are not aware of any report concerning
the isolation of FBP in a high yield in the form of high
purity powder. A primary reason for this is that FBP is
extremely unstable in aqueous solutions especially under
acidic conditions, and decomposes completely within several
minutes even in a weakly acidic aqueous solution. Because of
this, steps for the purification of FBP cannot be effected
easily. Also, when FBP is synthesized using the
aforementioned organic synthesis process, conversion ratio of
FCP into FBP by hydrolysis is low (about 15%), and the
isolation of FBP is quite difficult because of the extremely
similar physical properties of the by-product FDP to those of
the
