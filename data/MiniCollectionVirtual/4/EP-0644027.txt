<ABSTRACT>
A face block (10) for an injection blow molding 
machine of the type used in producing thermoplastic 

containers. The face block has a lateral series of 
openings (14) extending axially therethrough, and each 

opening receives an end portion of an elongate tubular 
core rod (16). The core rod has an annular bushing 

(18) secured to the end portion that is received in the 
opening, and the opening is sized to permit radial 

movement of the annular bushing therein to permit the 
core rod to move relative to the face block. The 

annular bushing has an annular recess (18a) in an end 
surface thereof and the recess carries an elastomeric 

O-ring (20) which sealingly engages an inturned annular 
flange (14a) at the rear of the opening. The core rod 

is axially positioned relative to the annular flange to 
maintain the O-ring in sealing engagement therewith by 

a U-shaped retainer (22) which is secured to the front 
of the face block. The retainer has legs (22a, 22b) 

which engage a recess (16a) in the outside of the core 
rod. The end of the core rod is radially pre-centered 

or pre-positioned, and preferably in a resilient 
manner, within the opening by at least three, and 

preferably four coil springs (30) carried by screws 
(28) which are threaded into radial openings (26) 

extending through the face block around each axially 
extending opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for producing 
containers or other hollow objects from a thermoplastic 
material by an injection blow molding process. More 
particularly, this invention relates to an improved 
sealing arrangement between the core rod of the mold 
tooling used to produce a specific blow molded object, 
such as a container of a specific size and shape, and 
the face block of the molding apparatus used to produce 
containers or other objects in a variety of sizes and 
shapes. It is known that thermoplastic containers and 
other hollow objects can be produced by a process known 
as the injection blow molding process in which closed 
end, hollow preforms or parisons are produced by an 
injection molding process at a first station on a 
rotary molding machine. In this process each preform 
is injection molded around the exterior of a long, 
narrow member, which is usually called a core rod. The 
core rod, or, typically, a multiplicity of like core 
rods in a multiple cavity molding machine, are inserted 
into a face block member of a rotary turret of the 
molding machine, and the rotary turret with the core 
rods inserted into its face block is indexed, after the 
parisons are formed on the core rods, to a blow 
molding station. At the molding station, the parisons, 
while still at a suitable molding temperature, are 
blown into the configuration of containers or other 
hollow objects against the internal surfaces of mating 
mold sections. In a process of this type, each core  
 
rod is hollow, and compressed air for the blowing 
operation is introduced from the molding machine 
through the face block into each object being blown 
through the core rod for that object. Because of the need to maintain a positive 
pressure within a container or other object while it is 
being blown to accomplish the blowing operation, it is 
necessary to provide a suitable seal between each core 
rod and an opening in the molding machine face block 
which receives an end of such core rod. Heretofore, it 
was customary to effect such seal by inserting an 
elastomeric O-ring in an annular groove in the inside 
surface of each core rod receiving opening of the face 
block. Such an O-ring would then seal against an 
outside diametral surface of the core rod, and would 
serve to prevent blowing air leakage from the molding 
machine through an annular opening between the inside 
of the face block opening and the outside of the core 
rod. However, the use of such a seal limits radial 
movement of the core rod
