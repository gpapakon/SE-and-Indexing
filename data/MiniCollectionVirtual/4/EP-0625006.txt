<DESCRIPTION>
 RA SGENIC COTTON PLANTS PRODUCING HETEROLOGOUS BIOPLASTICField of the Invention The present invention relates to the field of plant genetic engineering. In particular, the present invention relates to the creation of transgenic cotton plants containing a heterologous bioplastic.BackgroundBioplastics Bioplastics are biologically produced polymers with many of the properties of petroleum-derived plastics. Bioplastics are long carbon and oxygen chain polyesters, the basic chemical structure of which is:The carbon to oxygen linkage is in the ester form. If the R group of the structure described above is an alkyl group/ the structure is a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) . Most typically, R is a carbon chain of between 1 and 10 residues. R groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl have been found in bioplastics.Poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) is a form of PHA found as an intracellular storage compound in many species of bacteria. PHB was identified in Bacillus mega erium in 1925. (Lemoigne, M. Ann Inst. Pasteur. Paris..35:144,1925). Referring to the structure described above, if R is a methyl group, the compound is PHB. PHB is a 

 biodegradable .thermoplastic that serves as a carbon and energy source for the bacterium. Due to its high degree of crystallinity, PHB is hard and brittle. Holmes, et al. , U.S. patent 4,393,167, discusses the use of PHB and PHB blends.In many bacteria, PHB is synthesized via a three-step metabolic pathway in which the enzymes ketothiolase, NADP- dependent acetoactyl-CoA reductase, and PHB synthase (PHB polymerase) catalyze the conversion of acetyl CoA to PHB (Dawes and Senior, Adv. Microb. Phvsiol. 10:135-266,1973). The genes corresponding to these three enzymes have been cloned from Alcaliσenes eutrophus. E. coli can be made to synthesize PHB after transformation with these genes (Slater et al. , J. Bacteriol. 170:4431-4436, 1988; Schubert et al., J. Bacteriol. 170:5837-5847, 1988; Slater et §_!_. , Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 58:1085- 1094, 1992; Peoples and Sinskey, J. Biol. Chem.. 264:15298-15303, 1989; Peoples and Sinskey, J. Biol. Chem.. 264:15293-15297, 1989). Bacterial genera producing bioplastics includeAlcaligenes, Athiorhodium, Azotobacter, Bacillus, norcardia, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Spirillium, Zoogloea and Rhodococcus (Haywood e_t al.. Biotech. Lett. 11:471-476, 1989). Depending on the nutrient source, the bacteria incorporates hetropolymers of the D-isomer of the beta- hydroxyalkanoates. (Brandl et. a . , Int. J. Biol. Macromol. , 11:49-55, 1989;
