<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the technical field of 
apparatus for controlling use equipments and 

particularly concerns a device for the remote adjustment 
of peripheral equipments which comprises a base unit (8) 

installed close to the peripheral equipment and provided 
with a microprocessor (4) and a modulation-demodulation 

circuitry (7), which base unit, through a double-wire 
line (9 and 10), supplies and exchanges data to a remote 

unit (21) in turn provided with a microprocessor (20) 
and a modulation-demodulation circuitry (11) to which 

adjustment parameters can be remotely inputted by acting 
on the operating mode of the peripheral equipment, all 

that being adjusted by a sequence of signals that, 
conveniently distributed, enable the peripheral-equipment 

adjusting actuators to be turned on and off.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the remote 
adjustment of peripheral equipments. It is known that in the field of electronically adjusted 
apparatus there is the problem of carrying out a remote 
adjustment of the peripheral equipments, such as for 
example boilers, air-conditioners, coolers and the like, 
bath in a domestic and industrial environment, without 
being obliged to regularly come close to the site where 
these equipments are installed, which would be time-consuming 
and would involve use of man-power to this 
end. In addition, in this type of adjustments a wide variety 
of application fields is to be provided, in that a 
diversification between the so-called domestic users and 
industrial users is impossible, due both to economical 
reasons and installation reasons. Moreover, it may happen that the particular 
adjustment adopted is suitable to a given type of boiler 
for example, and cannot be used for others. At the present state of the art no specific embodiments 
exist that are capable of meeting the above requirements 
in a consistent manner from the point of view of plant 
engineering, offering at the same time reasonable prices 
and very simple technical solutions. There are for example boilers provided with adjustment 
microprocessors which are then connected, through 
connecting means, to remote control boards enabling the 
remote inputting of the adjusting parameters. This type 
of adjustment is very onerous in terms of circuits, 
installations and prices and in addition it is not 
always adapted to the several different types of  
 
peripheral equipments. The object of the present invention is to eliminate the 
above drawbacks typical of the apparatus presently in 
use, by providing a device for the remote adjustment of 
peripheral equipments, in which device, located close to 
a peripheral equipment, nhe whole circuitry relating to 
the control functions of the peripheral itself has been 
incorporated, said peripheral being connected via a 
double-wire line to remote units so that the control 
operations carried out by the device are made quick, 
reliable and practically feasible. The above and still further objects that will become 
more apparent in the course of the following description 
are achieved by a device for the remote adjustment of 
peripheral equipments as claimed in the first main claim 
and in the following dependent claims. Further features and advantages will be best understood 
from the detailed description of a preferred embodiment 
of a device
