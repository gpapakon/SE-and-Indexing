<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medicines for
potentiating the immune function of the human, animals or
the like so as to protect them from infection, and a process
for the production thereof.Owing to the recent advancement of immunology, various
disorders or infectious diseases of the human and animals
have come to be considered to be caused by reduction or
failure in immune function.In the case of the human, for example, immune function
is reduced or brought to failure by bronchial asthma,
allergic diseases, articular rheumatism, autoimmune
diseases, nutritional disorders, surgical operations,
advanced age, pregnancy, etc. in many cases, so that
infectious diseases such as respiratory infection, sepsis
and urinary tract infection are developed at the same time.
Various kinds of antibiotics have heretofore been
administered against these disorders and infectious
diseases.In livestock and marine products industries on the
other hand, large-scale operation or overcrowded breeding 
has been conducted in order to rear livestock, poultry or
cultured fishes with high efficiency. The massive
administration of antibiotics have been adopted in such
breeding.Under such circumstances, Japanese Patent Application
Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 286923/1987 discloses the fact that
proline (pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid), which is a sort of
amino acid produced by the decomposition of a protein, has
an immune-enhancing action. Further, Japanese Patent
Publication No. 38985/1988 discloses the fact that
glutamine, which is a derivative of proline, has an immune-enhancing
action.Riboflavin useful in the practice of the present
invention is phosphorylated invivo to form twenty-odd
flavoenzymes such as amino acid oxidases and xanthine
oxidases as coenzymes (for example, flavin mononucleotide
and flavin adenine dinucleotide), so that it participates in
the oxidation-reduction mechanism of organism and plays an
important part in metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids,
proteins, etc.In the case of the human, it has been known that the
lack of riboflavin leads to cheilitis, acute chronic eczema,
solar eczema, seborrheic eczema, conjunctivitis, angular
cheilitis, glossitis, pellagra or the like. Accordingly,
riboflavin is used for preventing and treating these
deficiency diseases of vitamine B2. Derivatives of riboflavin have been known to have
substantially the same pharmacological action as that of
riboflavin and to be applied to the same disorders or
diseases.When a specific antibiotic is used continuously, its
resistant bacteria

<CLAIMS>
The use of an immunopotentiation and infection protection
amount of riboflavin and/or a riboflavin derivative excluding

flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, or a
pharmacologically permissible salt of riboflavin, for the

preparation of a pharmaceutical for immunopotentiation and
infection protection, wherein said riboflavin and/or

riboflavin derivative is used as the sole immunopotentiation
and infection protection agent.
The use of riboflavin and/or a riboflavin derivative
excluding flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine

dinucleotide, or a pharmacologically permissible salt of
riboflavin, and a synergistic amount of proline and/or

glutamine for the preparation of a pharmaceutical for
immunopotentiation and infection protection.
The use of a riboflavin and/or a riboflavin derivative
excluding flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine

dinucleotide, or a pharmacologically permissible salt of
riboflavin and a synergistic amount of antibiotic for the

preparation of a pharmaceutical for immunopotentiation and
infection protection.
The use of an immunopotentiation and infection protection
amount of riboflavin and/or a riboflavin derivative excluding

flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, or a
pharmacologically permissible salt of riboflavin and an

enhancing amount of water-soluble polymer or lecithin for the
preparation of a pharmaceutical for immunopotentiation and

infection protection.
The use according to claim 4 wherein the water-soluble
polymers, one or more water-soluble polymers selected from the

group consisting of polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sodium
carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl

cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, sodium chondroitin
sulfate, polyethylene-hardened castor oil, polyoxysorbitan

fatty acid esters and polyvinyl alcohol.
The use according to claim 4 wherein the lecithin is one
or more lecithins selected from the group consisting of yolk

lecithin, soybean lecithin and hydrogenated lecithins thereof.
The use of riboflavin and/or a riboflavin derivative
excluding flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine

dinucleotide or a pharmacologically permissible salt of
riboflavin for the preparation of a vaccine.
A vaccine preparation comprising riboflavin and/or a
riboflavin derivative excluding flavin mononucleotide and

flavin adenine dinucleotide or a pharmacologically permissible

salt of riboflavin and a vaccine.
The use of an immunopotentiation and infection protection
amount of riboflavin and/or a riboflavin derivative excluding

flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide or a
pharmacologically permissible salt of riboflavin, for the

preparation of a pharmaceutical for the treatment of diseases
selected from the group consisting of: in humans, leukopenia,

autoimmune diseases, sepsis and urinary tract infection; in
swine, diarrhea, epidemic pneumonia, atrophic rhinitis and

infectious gastroenteritis; in domestic fowl, pneumonia and
Marek's disease; in bovines, diarrhea, pneumonia and udder
