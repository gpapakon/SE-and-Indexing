<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the process by which 
three-dimensional images, moving or stationary, may be transformed 
and transmitted, and then reconstructed for viewing 
purposes by the use of optical wavelength reconstruction 
techniques; and particularly to the use of holograms for such 
purposes. The process of optical wavelength reconstruction 
is generally referred to as holography. Techniques for 
producing holograms vary, but in essence they entail what is 
shown in Figure 1 as follows: a source beam of coherent light, 
usually a laser 1, is passed through a beam splitter 2 
producing two distinct beams: an object beam 7 and a reference 
beam 8. With the aid of lenses 3 and 4, each beam of coherent 
laser light is spread to form a wavefront of light. The 
object beam 7 wavefront is directed at a mirror 5 which 
reflects the wavefront onto the object 6. The currently 
accepted recording device, film 10, then receives the object 
beam 7 reflected from the object 6 and reference beam 8 and 
records the image as a pattern on photographic film. The reflected illumination from the object is in 
the form of expanding spherical wavefronts, derived from the  
 
interaction of the coherent light wavefront and every point on 
the object, producing an irregular wavefront that contains 
certain information about the object. When the second beam, 
the reference beam 8, from the same coherent light source, is 
directed to the recording device without being reflected from 
the object, the two beams form an interference pattern on the 
film. This interference pattern is formed by the constructive 
and destructive interference of the object and reference beam 
wavefronts on the film. This interference pattern, as shown 
in Figure 2, is comprised of intensity variations in the 
phases and amplitudes of the two wavefronts. In summary, the 
recording and subsequent reillumination of an interference 
pattern of the object and reference beams of coherent light is 
a hologram. Holograms differ from conventional photography in 
two important ways. Conventional photography records an image 
of reflected incoherent visible light by focusing the image, 
through the use of a lens, on film. When developed this image 
is then visible to the naked eye using any standard non-coherent 
light source. A standard holographic recording uses 
no focusing device to form an image, but rather records the 
interference patterns of coherent light. When developed, a 
hologram produces a non-recognizable image when viewed by the 
naked eye
