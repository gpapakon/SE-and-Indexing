<ABSTRACT>
Figure 1 shows a magnetic measuring system (1), the magnetoresistive elements (5) of which are arranged at an angle ( beta ) to the measuring direction X in a scanning unit (4). The magnetoresistive elements (5) are magnetically biased with the aid of an auxiliary magnetic field (Y) which acts perpendicularly to the measuring direction (X).

Position measuring device (1) for measurement of the 
relative position of two objects movable to one 

another, in which a periodic magnetic measurement 
graduation (3) provided on one of the two objects is 

scanned in the direction of measurement (X) by a 
scanning unit (4) provided on the other of the two 

objects by means of several magneto-resistive elements 
(5) to generate position-dependent output signals 

(SIN, COS), from which position measured values are 
formed in an evaluation system, said magneto-resistive 

elements (5) being arranged in the scanning unit (4) 
in a plane parallel to the measurement graduation (3) 

and inclined at an angle (β) to the direction of 
measurement (X) and said angle (β) differing from 0° 

and 90°, and the magneto-resistive elements (5) are 
arranged one behind the other in the direction of 

measurement (X) at distances of fractions of 
graduation periods (P) and are circuited together to 

form electrical bridges, characterised in that the 
length of the magneto-resistive elements (5) arranged 

in this manner measured in the direction of 
measurement (X) amounts to a fraction of the 

graduation period (P), in which case the fraction is 
determined by the reciprocal of the upper harmonic to 

be eliminated, and the magneto-resistive elements (5) 
are magnetically biased by a magnetic auxiliary field 

(Y) acting perpendicular to the field of scatter 
caused by the scale magnetisation.

their displacement in the direction of measurement (X) 
is stepped according to a COS function so that the

a filter function for filtering upper harmonics, and

perpendicular to the field of scatter caused by the
