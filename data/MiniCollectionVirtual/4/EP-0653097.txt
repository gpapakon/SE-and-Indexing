<ABSTRACT>
A latching electromagnet is provided. The electromagnet (300) includes a core (305) having a pole face, a coil of windings (325), and an armature (330). Advantageously, the core has a geometry that locally increases the magnetic flux density to saturation levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a control mechanism with an 
electromagnet comprising a core that operates with a portion of 
the core in magnetic saturation. Latching electromagnets are used in a variety 
of applications. In one application, a control 
circuit may require that an electromagnet "latch" a 
moveable member to a detent position. Further, the 
control circuit may also require that the moveable 
member be "de-latched" from the detent position by a 
mechanical device that provides a predetermined force. 
However if the "latching" force of the electromagnet 
varies, then the mechanical device may not have 
sufficient force to overcome the electromagnetic 
force. Consequently the moveable member remains 
latched to the detent position, possibly causing the 
control system to malfunction. In another application, an electromagnet may 
be provided to latch a control lever of an electrohydraulic 
control at a detent position. The control 
lever is latched at the detent position until; either 
the electromagnet de-energizes, or an operator 
manually de-latches the control lever from the 
energized electromagnet. If the later occurs, the 
operator must apply a force to the control lever that 
overcomes the electromagnetic force. Unfortunately, prior electromagnet designs 
do not produce a substantially constant  
 
electromagnetic force. For example, a prior 
electromagnet 100 is shown in Fig. 1. The 
electromagnet 100 includes a core 105, a coil 110 and 
an armature 115. Upon being energized, the coil 110 
produces an electromagnetic force which "latches" the 
armature 115 to the core 105. Upon deenergization of 
the coil 110, a spring 120 biases the armature to a 
neutral position. Shown in Fig. 2, is a Force vs. Current 
curve which illustrates the relationship between the 
electromagnetic force and the coil current (when the 
armature is latched to the core). During operation, 
the coil current fluctuates between a minimum and 
maximum value. The current fluctuation is caused by 
changes in coil temperature and voltage. Due to the 
"steepness" of the curve, the resulting 
electromagnetic force may vary between a force that is 
too small - allowing for inadvertent de-latching of 
the control lever; to a force that is too large - 
yielding a force too great for the operator to 
overcome. Another undesirable feature of the prior 
electromagnet design pertains to a varying air gap 
length. For example as shown in Fig. 1, the armature 
115 is designed to latch "flush" with the 
electromagnetic core. However
