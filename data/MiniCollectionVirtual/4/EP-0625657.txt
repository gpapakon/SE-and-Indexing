<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a cup-shaped or rolling membrane (diaphragm), particularly for brake cylinders which differs from known membranes of this kind in that it is not, as usual, formed by a fabric coated on both sides with an elastomeric material but by a fabric coated on only one side with said material. Both cost savings in production and functional improvements during use as intended are thereby achieved.

Method of producing a cup-shaped or roll-shaped diaphragm for
automotive vehicle brake cylinders, which diaphragm is formed from a

fabric ply (15) coated with an elastomer layer (14) and has a substantially
flat base (11), said diaphragm being displaceable in the axial direction

towards its outer edge (6), which can be clamped in position in the brake
cylinder, by inward and outward movements of its flexible walls and

having a support layer of concentric annular ribs, correspondingly
annularly disposed knubs or similar raised portions (17, 17') on its internal

surface (15.2), which is supportable in the position of use on a rigid piston
plate, characterised in that the diaphragm body (3) is formed from a fabric

ply (15), which is unilaterally coated with an elastomer layer (14) only on
its external surface (15.1) facing away from the piston plate in the position

of use, portions of the elastomer layer (14) being pushed through the fabric
ply (15) and being vulcanised onto the fabric ply (15) on the internal

surface (15.2) in the form of concentric annular ribs, correspondingly
annularly disposed knubs or similar raised portions (17, 17').
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that, during the
formation of the diaphragm body (3), portions of the elastomer layer (14)

are pushed through the fabric ply (15) and vulcanised onto the fabric ply
(15) on the internal surface (15.2) as a thin elastomeric covering.
Cup-shaped or roll-shaped diaphragm for automotive vehicle brake
cylinders, which diaphragm is formed from a fabric ply (15) coated with

an elastomer layer (14) and has a substantially flat base (11), said
diaphragm being displaceable in the axial direction towards its outer edge, 

which can be clamped in position in the brake cylinder, by inward and
outward movements of its flexible walls and having a support elastomer

layer of concentric annular ribs, correspondingly annularly disposed knubs
or similar raised portions (17, 17') on its internal surface (15.2), which is

supportable in the position of use on a rigid piston plate, characterised in
that it is formed from a fabric ply (15), which has a cuating formed from

an elastomer only on the side forming the external surface (15.1) of the
cup-shaped or roll-shaped diaphragm, and is uncoated on the side forming

the internal surface (15.2) of the cup-shaped or roll-shaped diaphragm, so
that the raised portions and possibly a thin elastomeric covering are

formed on the internal surface (15.2) from portions of the elastomer layer
(14) which are pushed through the fabric ply (15) during the formation of

the cup-shaped or roll-shaped diaphragm.
Cup-shaped or roll-shaped diaphragm according to claim 3,
characterised in that the width (b) of the annular ribs (17) is 1 - 2 mm.
Cup-shaped or roll-shaped diaphragm according to one of claims 3
to 4, characterised in that the internal spacing (a) between two annular ribs

(17) is substantially 1 mm.
Cup-shaped or roll-shaped diaphragm according to one of claims 3
to 5, characterised in that the height (h) of the annular ribs (17) is

substantially 1 mm.
