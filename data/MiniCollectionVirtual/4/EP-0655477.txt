<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for forming articles for 
immunological assays. A large number of current chemical-clinical evaluations are based 
on so-called solid-phase immunological assays. As is known to the 
expert of the art, solid-phase immunological assays utilize 
articles, generally constructed of polymeric material and more 
specifically of polystyrene, which perform the double function of 
containing the fluids and reagents for the analysis, and of acting 
as an interface on which the reagents for originating the reaction 
on which the analysis is based are initially fixed. These 
articles can be of different forms, the most common of which are 
test tubes, spheres, microwells formed in a single plate and 
strips of microwells fixed onto a frame. A typical immunological 
analysis scheme comprises fixing (technically known as 
"adsorbing") for example an antigen onto microwells. The sample 
to be analyzed, which can contain the antibody for this antigen, 
is then added. In this case the antigen and antibody form a 
complex, the presence of which is detected by adding suitable 
reagents which generally develop a coloration used as the 
analytical signal. If the presence of a given antigen is to be 
detected, a suitable antibody has to be adsorbed onto the surface 
of the article used for the solid-phase immunological assay. From this brief description it is apparent that the effectiveness 
and sensitivity of a detection system for the immunological assay 
require the combination of certain important aspects. Firstly the  
 
antigen-antibody biochemical system must be optimized, as must all 
the reagents used for detecting the analyzed substance. Again, 
the surface of the solid phase, consisting of the article used for 
the immunological assay, must have high capacity for adsorbing 
biological molecules. This characteristic results in precision 
and reproducibility of the measurement, even when working with 
very low concentrations of the analyzed substance. A further 
desirable characteristic of the article is that it maintains the 
bond with the biological molecules even in the presence of 
surfactants, which are normally used in immunological assays 
during washing to eliminate those weakly and unstably adsorbed 
biological molecules which could provide spurious signals during 
detection. In addition, as the analytical signal is generally 
detected by spectrophotometric measurements, the solid substrate 
must have a high degree of transparency. Basically the 
fundamental characteristics
