<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is described for discharging material 
through an elongate aperture (12) in a substantially constant 

amount per unit length of the aperture (12). According to the 
invention the apparatus comprises a screw discharging unit 

(2) having an inlet end (6) and including a screw housing (3) 
with a casing wall (4) and a screw (5) rotatably mounted in 

the screw housing (3). The elongate aperture (12) is provided 
in the casing wall (4) and extends substantially parallel to the 

axis (11) of rotation of the screw (5). The screw (5) has a core 
(13) and at least one screw blade (14) extending around the 

core (13) and having a predetermined pitch for feeding the 
material from the inlet end (6) to the elongate aperture (12). 

The core (13) and the casing wall (4) define therebetween a 
space (16) having an annular cross section area successively 

decreasing the direction of feed of the screw (5).
