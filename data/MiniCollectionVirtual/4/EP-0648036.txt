<ABSTRACT>
Of special application in digital radiocommunications systems with 
time division multiple access. 
A bandpass input signal (S) is received which is split into two identical 
branches by a divider (1) in order to obtain, by frequency conversion means 

(2), two low pass signals, one in-phase and one in quadrature (Is,Qs), which 
are applied to adaptive filtering means (3) that equalise the communications 

channel, presenting an equalised signal (Rc) at its output which is finally 
demodulated in differential demodulation means (4) the output of which 

(Rd) is sent to decision means (5) that generate the output data signal (D). 
This output data signal (D), the demodulated signal (Rd) and the 
equalized signal delayed by one symbol period (Rt), are used by the 

adaptive filtering means (3) in order to update the coefficients used in the 
adaptive filtering.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a digital radio receiver that receives a 
bandpass signal with phase modulation and which, without recovering the 
carrier, regenerates the transmitted data by means of baseband differential 
demodulation from the in-phase and quadrature components previously 
equalised to compensate for linear distorsion produced in the 
communications channel. It is of special application in burst transmission systems with 
multipropagation that require channel equalisation and in which the system 
efficiency is of vital importance, this efficiency being understood as the ratio 
between the useful information bits and the total bits sent. In communications systems with multipropagation, such as the case of 
point to multipoint systems, the antenna of the central station is usually of 
the omnidirectional type since the terminal equipments can be distributed 
over a determined area whereby, although these terminal equipments have 
directional antennas, the received signal, both at the central station and by 
the terminal equipments, is usually subject to selective fading which notably 
deteriorates the quality of the received signal. In order to overcome this impairment and assure the quality of the 
communications, equalizing circuits are employed that have a variable 
transfer function that depends on internal parameters, and the purpose of 
which is to compensate for the linear distorsion of the communications 
channel over which the signal is transmitted, so that this signal does not 
suffer channel impairment. Nevertheless, for these systems to work correctly in baseband, it is 
necessary to recover the carrier which requires a certain time and this is 
usually incompatible with burst transmission systems, which try to minimise 
the part with non-useful information and thereby boost the efficiency of the 
system. On the other hand, in the compromise between quality and efficiency, 
differential demodulators are used. The block diagram of a baseband 
differential demodulator can be seen in the article "Implementation of Coded 
Modems" by Shuzo Kato et al., IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE,  
 
December 1991, pages 88 to 97. In this type of demodulator it is not necessary to recover the carrier, 
for which reason it concerns an extremely fast demodulator in which the 
output data can start to appear with a delay of only one bit. The frequency error in the local oscillators must, in any case, be 
limited to a value that makes the extra phase shift produced in a bit period, 
as a consequence of
