<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photosensitive resin composition
and a photosensitive resin composition for an i-line
stepper which contains a photoinitiator.In the semiconductor industries, inorganic materials have
conventionally been used for interlaminar insulation.
Recently, organic materials having an excellent heat-resistance
such as a polyimide resin have been put to use as
materials for interlaminar insulation because of properties
thereof.A process for forming a pattern in a semiconductor integrated
circuit or forming a pattern of a circuit on a print
substrate comprises complex and various steps such as film
formation of a resist material on a substrate surface;
exposure of required portion to light; removal of unnecessary
portion by etching or the like; and washing of the
substrate surface. Therefore, development of heat-resistant 
photosensitive materials have been desired, which
enables the required portion of the resist material to be
remained as such and used as insulating materials even
after the pattern is formed by exposure to light and development.As such a material, heat-resistant photosensitive materials
comprising, for example, a photosensitive polyimide or a
cyclized polybutadiene as a base polymer have been proposed.
The photosensitive polyimide has particularly
attracted attentions since it has an excellent heat-resistance
and impurities contained therein can easily be
removed.As such a photosensitive polyimide, for example, one which
comprises a polyimide precursor and a bichromate has been
proposed for the first time in Japanese Patent Publication
No. 17374/1974. This photosensitive polyimide has an
advantage that it has a photosensitivity suitable for practical
uses and also has a high film-forming ability.
However, it also has a disadvantage that it has a low
preservability and a low stability and that a chromium ion
remains in the polyimide, and therefore it has not been put
to practical use.As another example, a photosensitive polyimide precursor in
which a photosensitive group is introduced into an polyamic
acid (polyimide precursor) by an ester bond has been proposed
in Japanese Patent Publication No. 30207/1980. This
material has a disadvantage that a finally obtained product
contains a chloride since a step for introducing the photosensitive
group comprises a dehydrochlorination reaction.In order to avoid these problems, for example, a process
for mixing a compound which contains a photosensitive group
with a polyimide precursor is disclosed in Japanese Provisional 
Patent
