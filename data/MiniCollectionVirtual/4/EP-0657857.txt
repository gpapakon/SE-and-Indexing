<ABSTRACT>
A traveling control system for a motor vehicle includes 
a detector for detecting an object which exists in front of 

the motor vehicle to follow a vehicle traveling ahead. The 
system further includes a first curse determination device 

for estimating a first course on which the motor vehicle will 
travel hereafter, an identification device for identifying an 

first target vehicle among the objects existing on the first 
course, and a second course estimation device for estimating 

based on the first target vehicle a second course on which 
the motor vehicle will travel hereafter at least while the 

first target vehicle is outside of the first course. The 
identification device identifies a second target vehicle 

among vehicles which travel on the first or second courses 
while the first target vehicle is outside of the first 

course.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a traveling control
system for a motor vehicle, and in particular to a traveling
vehicle which can follow up another vehicle traveling ahead of the
vehicle and can avoid a contact with the another vehicle.The conventional obstacle detection system used in such
traveling control system for the motor vehicle is
disclosed in for example Japanese Patent Publication No. 51-7892.
The conventional obstacle detection system includes a
radar device which detects an obstacle such as a vehicle
traveling ahead by transmitting radar waves such as an
ultrasonic wave and an electric wave toward the front
direction of the vehicle, a rotation device for rotating the
radar device in a horizontal direction, and a steering sensor
for detecting a steering angle of the vehicle. According to
the steering angle detected by the steering sensor, the radar
device is rotated by the predetermined horizontal angle by
the rotation device and the radar wave is transmitted in the 
same direction as the direction in which the vehicle is
traveling.Recently a scanning-type radar device has been
developed. The scanning-type radar device scans a wide scope
in the horizontal direction and picks up only the information
of the obstacle located on a traveling course on which the
vehicle is supposed to travel hereafter. The traveling
course is estimated by the driving conditions of the vehicle
such as a steering angle and/or a vehicle speed.The above-mentioned conventional obstacle detection
system estimates the traveling course based on the driving
conditions of the vehicle, when the radar device detects the
other vehicle traveling ahead on the estimated traveling
course. Therefore, there is a problem in the conventional
obstacle detection system. Namely, when the other vehicle
traveling ahead goes into the curved road from the straight
road and the vehicle equipped with such detection system
is still traveling on the straight road, the another vehicle
traveling ahead has left the estimated traveling course. As
a result, the vehicle with the detection system can not
detect in an early stage a vehicle which newly enters into
the curved road and travels between the another vehicle
ahead and the vehicle with the detection system. The US 4,158,841 discloses a method and an apparatus for the control of the
safety distance of a vehicle with respect to preceding objects. The apparatus
comprises a radar system which is able to detect obstacles in front of the
vehicle. The method and the apparatus of US 4,158,841
