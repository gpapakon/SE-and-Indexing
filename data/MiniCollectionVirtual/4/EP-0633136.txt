<ABSTRACT>
An ink-jet printing apparatus having a first 
printing head 2 at an upper position with respect to a 

cloth-conveying direction and a second printing head 2' 
at a lower position with respect to the cloth-conveying 

direction, scans the printing heads in a direction 
orthogonal to the cloth-conveying direction. An image 

printed by the first printing head is complemented by 
the second printing head. If a stop of printing is 

instructed during the printing by the first printing 
head, the printing by the first printing head is 

stopped, and printing by the second printing head is 
continued till the position of the image printed by the 

first printing head is printed by the second printing 
head. In this manner, a printed image completed to the 

end of the image can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
Present invention relates to an ink-jet printing
apparatus and method for printing a color image on a
recording medium based on received image data and,
printed matter obtained by the ink-jet printing
apparatus and a processed article obtained from the
printed matter.Conventionally, ink-jet printing apparatuses have
been developed for printing color images on a large-sized
recording medium such as a cloth, see EP-A-0 558 236 which represents a prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC. Desired images
are printed on, e.g., wall paper and textiles, using
these apparatuses.In printing, to convey such large-sized recording
medium, the printing apparatus has a printing-medium
conveying mechanism and a printing mechanism,
constructed separately, further, upper and lower ink-jet
heads. The lower ink-jet head performs printing based
on thinned image data, and the upper ink-jet head
performs printing based on residual image data to
complete the image. This reduces the amount of ink to 
be discharged on a predetermined area on a cloth as the
recording medium, thus raises ink-absorbing rate and
drying efficiency.In the above-mentioned conventional apparatus,
synchronization between the printing mechanism and the
cloth-feeding mechanism is important. When the printing
apparatus has upper and lower printing heads, and cloth
is fed from a lower position to an upper position, when
the printing operation is terminated at one point, a
portion printed by only the lower printing head remains
incomplete. The printing operation must be continued to
complete the printed image of this portion.Further, if the apparatus uses only one controller
for controlling the cloth-feeding mechanism for
conveying a large-sized recording medium and the
printing mechanism, a long time period is required for
conveying the recording medium, and printing efficiency
is lowered. For example, upon printing, the printing
head carriage on which the printing head is mounted must
precisely move at a high speed while the cloth is
conveyed precisely by rotating a motor. To control
these operations simultaneously, a high-speed CPU is
necessary, and the control becomes complicated.Furthermore, a large-sized cloth has seams,
normally risen from other portions. Since the space
between the end portion of the ink-jet head and the 
recording medium is very small, if the image is printed
on the seam, the end portion of the ink-jet head
contacts the risen portion, and the seam gets soaked
with ink from the head nozzles by capillary action and
the recording medium

<CLAIMS>
An ink-jet printing apparatus (
3001
, 
3002
) for
performing printing by scanning a printing head (
2
, 
2'
) in
a predetermined direction over a printing medium (
103
)
having a seam, comprising:


scan means 
(3-5)
 for scanning the printing head in
said predetermined direction;
detection means (
3013; S71
) for detecting the seam of
the printing medium;
conveying means (
3002, 3014; S73
) for conveying the
printing medium; and
control means (
S83-S86
) for causing said scan means to
move the printing head from a position above the printing

medium, if said detection means detects the seam of the
printing medium, and for causing said conveying means to

convey the printing medium so that the seam is positioned
outside of a printing head passing area, after said scan

means has moved the printing head from the position.
An apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 said conveying means are provided separately from
printing means (
3001
) having communication means for
performing communication with communication means of said

conveying means in accordance with a predetermined
communication protocol; wherein said printing means outputs

an instruction for conveying the printing medium to said
conveying means via said communication means; waits for

completion of conveying the printing medium by said
conveying means and starts a next operation. 
An apparatus according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 said conveying means have instruction means (
3015

instructing an emergency stop of printing operation, and

said conveying means disables the communication to said
printing means by the emergency stop by said instruction

means.
An ink-jet printing method for performing printing
by scanning a printing head (
2, 2'
) in a predetermined
direction over a printing medium (
103
) having a seam,

An apparatus according to any one of the preceding
Claims 1 to 3 or a method according to Claim 4,


characterized in that
 said ink-jet printing head has
heat-generating elements which generate thermal energy, as

energy utilized for discharging ink, to cause film-boiling
