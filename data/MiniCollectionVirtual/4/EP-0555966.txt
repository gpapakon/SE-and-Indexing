<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a device that can 
obtain fresh water from fog. The fog water collecting 

device comprises a vertical shaft (11), windmill elements 
(13) for producing rotational force from wind, a 

cylindrical rotating structure (12) supported so as to 
rotate about the said vertical shaft, a water collecting 

vessel (15) secured at the bottom of this rotating 
structure, a plurality of flexible rods (14) one end of 

each is fixed at the upper portion of said rotating 
structure and the other end of each is directed toward 

said water collecting vessel and, a receiving conduit for 
obtaining water collected in the said water collecting 

vessel. When the said rotating structure turns from fog 
containing wind, water droplets sequentially adhere and 

accumulate on the said flexible rods, then collect in the 
said water collecting vessel, and are subsequently 

directed toward an external destination via the said 
conduit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for collecting
water from naturally occurring fog.In arid regions of earth, such as the Arabian
Peninsula, fresh water is obtained from sea water by such
processes as ion exchange and distillation.The previous methods require large scale facilities
and are not suitable for conveniently obtaining fresh
water.Also, since sea water is pumped from the sea and
processed, facilities are required for procuring the
pretreated water and disposing of the post-treated water.The object of the present invention is to provide a
device which enables obtaining fresh water from fog.
The prior art document US-A-2,761,292 discloses a windmill operated heat exchanger for condensing water from air.In order to achieve the above object, the present
invention provides a fog water collecting device which
comprises:
   a vertical shaft, a rotating structure,
having windmill elements which turn by
rotational force produced by wind supported said vertical
shaft so as to rotate about said vertical shaft, a water
collecting vessel secured at the bottom of said rotating structure, a
plurality of flexible rods one end of each being secured
to the upper portion of said rotating structure, and the
other end of each being directed toward said water collecting
vessel, and a conduit for receiving water
from said water collecting vessel, whereby fog containing wind turns the
rotating structure so that condensed water droplets sequentially adhere to and accumulate on said flexible rods, and are then collected in said water collecting vessel, and obtained via said conduit. When wind containing fog blows, rotational force is
produced in the windmill elements, which then turn about
the vertical axis of the rotating structure. As a
result, the flexible rods directed from top to bottom of
the rotating structure also rotate together with it. By
their own mass, centrifugal force causes the flexible
rods to flex in the perpendicular direction from the
vertical axis, i.e., in the horizontal direction. When
the rods rotate, water droplets contained in the moisture
laden air adhere to exteriors of the rods and fall as
water drops into the collecting vessel. Water collected
in the water collecting vessel flows into the conduit,
then via the conduit to the exterior of the device.As mentioned above, according to the present
invention, when fog containing wind strikes the rods
mounted to the rotating structure, fog droplets adhere
and accumulate on the rods, after which the condensed
water is collected. The device of this
