<ABSTRACT>
Motor vehicle gearbox of the "power shift" type with two intermediate shafts (3, 4) for alternately transmitting an input torque to an output shaft (5). The intermediate shafts each present a pair of lockable gear wheels (10, 11 and 15, 16, resp.), rotatably mounted on respective shafts and lockable by means of coupling means (12, 13 and 18, 19 resp.), said gear wheels engaging with a pair of gear wheels (20, 21) common for both the intermediate shafts, mounted rotatably on the output shaft and drivably coupled together in order to allow torque transmission from said one intermediate shaft (3) to the other intermediate shaft (4) via either one or both of the common gear wheels (20, 21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor vehicle gearbox 
according to the preamble of claim 1. Two main types of gearbox of the above mentioned type are known 
for example from SE 464347 (EP-A-0 354 890) and SE 467426 
(WO-A-92/108067). Both these gearbox types are so-called "power 
shift" gearboxes in which the torque is transmitted alternately 
via both the intermediate shafts to the output shaft, which 
means that whilst the torque is being transmitted by one of the 
intermediate shafts the next gear is preselected on the other 
intermediate shaft, whereby gear changing itself occurs in that 
the first intermediate shaft is disengaged and the other is 
engaged. This can be achieved either by driving the input shaft 
of each of the intermediate shafts and alternately engaging the 
input shafts via a pair of clutches outside the gearbox as 
shown in the aforementioned SE 464347 (EP-A-0 354 890), or by 
driving both intermediate shafts from a common input shaft via 
friction clutches arranged within the gearbox housing as shown 
in the aforementioned SE 467426 (WO-A-92/08067). A characteristic of these known gearboxes is that the torque in 
a gear stage, namely the lowest gear, is transmitted via both 
intermediate shafts by means of a common gear wheel. In this 
way an additional reduction stage is achieved compared with the 
torque transmission, via only one intermediate shaft at a time, 
which allows the possibility of higher gearing in the lowest 
gear than can otherwise be obtained. Alternatively, for a given 
gearing, larger gear wheels can be used than with torque 
transmission via an intermediate shaft. The construction gives 
an extra gear stage without the gearbox needing to be 
complemented with additional cooperating gear wheels. The 
result is a very short and compact gearbox with a large number 
of gears. The object of the present invention, starting from the gearbox 
described in the introduction, is to achieve a compact gearbox  
 
with many gear stages and with larger span, that is to say 
larger separation between the lowest and highest gears than can 
practically be obtained with the described known gearboxes. This is achieved according to the invention in a motor vehicle 
gear box having the characterizing features of claim 1. By creating an additional reduction stage in this way with a 
second common gear wheel which is smaller than the first common 
gear wheel, an extremely high gearing can be achieved in the 
lowest gear. Moreover two additional gears are obtained which,

Motor vehicle gearbox, comprising two parallel intermediate 
shafts (3,4) for transmission of an input torque to 

an output shaft (5), whereby a first and a second gear wheel 
(10,15), rotatably mounted on a first and a second 

intermediate shaft, respectively, and lockable by means of 
coupling means (12,18) on respective shaft, are in engagement 

with a first common gear wheel (20) rotatably mounted with 
respect to the output shaft and lockable for rotation 

together with the output shaft, said gear wheels being 
arranged to transmit torque from one intermediate shaft to 

the other in the disengaged position of the first common gear 
wheel, 
characterized in
 that at least a third and a fourth 
gear wheel (11, 16) on the first and the second intermediate 

shaft (3, 4), respectively are in engagement with at least a 
second common gear wheel (21) which is drivably coupled to 

the first common gear wheel (20) in order to allow torque 
transmission from said first gear wheel (10) on said first-mentioned 

intermediate shaft (3) to said fourth gear wheel 
(16) on the second intermediate shaft (4) via both the common 

gear wheels (20, 21), and in that the second intermediate 
shaft (4) is divided into two parts (4a, 4b) rotatable 

relative to each other, said parts being engageable with each 
other by means of coupling means (19) for rotation as a unit. 
Gearbox according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the 
second intermediate shaft (4) comprises an input shaft 

portion (4a) and an output shaft portion (4b) which, in the 
shaft portions' disengaged position, allows torque 

transmission from the input shaft portion to the output shaft 
portion via the first and second common gear wheel (20 and 21 

resp.). 
Gearbox according to either of claims 1 or 2, 

characterized in
 that the second common gear wheel (21) has a 
smaller diameter than the first common gear wheel (20).  

 
Gearbox according to any one of claims 1-3, 
characterized 
in

when the first common gear wheel (20) is disengaged from the 

output shaft (5) - to transmit torque via first gear's 
gearing with a locked first gear wheel (10) on said first 

intermediate shaft (3) and locked second gear wheel (16) on 
the second intermediate shaft (4). 
Gearbox according to any one of claims 1-4, 
characterized 
in
 that the second common gear wheel (21) is arranged to
