<ABSTRACT>
A sealed electrical connector (14) includes a 
housing (40) having an interior cavity (26) for sealingly 

receiving a mating connector (12). A latch arm (42) 
engages the mating connector for holding the connectors in 

mated condition. A passageway (50) communicates the 
interior cavity with the environment. A seal (31) closes 

the passageway. The latch arm includes a release portion 
(52) for biasing the seal and opening the passageway to 

release air entrapped in the cavity automatically as a 
function of mating the connectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to an environmentally
sealed connector, such as a waterproof connector or the
like, according to the preamble of claim 1.Environmentally sealed electrical connector
assemblies generally include a pair of mating connector
housings, such as male and female housings, wherein one of
the housings mounts some form of 11011 ring seal which is
compressed against the housing of the mating connector to
seal the mating interface between the housings. In addition,
each matable connector housing mounts a plurality of
terminals or contacts which are respectively terminated to a
plurality of electrical wires. The wires and/or terminals
project through sealing blocks which are effective to seal
the interior of the connector housings from the environment
in the area of the exiting wires. A typical sealed connector
of this type is shown in US-4,395,085.One of the problems which continues to plague such
sealed connector assemblies concerns the buildup of pressure
within the connector housings during mating of the
connectors, as well as the creation of a vacuum during
unmating of the connectors. In other words, with such sealed
connectors, especially in larger connector assemblies, high
mating and unmating forces often are experienced because of
the pressure buildup due to air trapped within the connector
housings during mating, as well as a vacuum created within
the connector housings during the unmating process. Such
pressure buildups within the connector housings also may
cause leaks, because the pressure buildup may unseat or
distort the seals.A sealed electrical connector with the features of
the preamble to claim 1 is known from GB-A-2,198,596. Air
entrapped in the cavity of the mated electrical connector 
assembly is released by annular thin elastomeric probe seals
which act as pressure relief valves for the entrapped air.
Such pressure relief valve does not open to allow air to
enter the cavity during unmating of the connectors.The present invention is directed to solving these
problems by providing a very simple release mechanism which
creates a pressure relief to allow air to escape or enter
the connector housings during the mating and unmating
processes, the pressure relief being effected automatically
in response to mating and unmating the connectors.An object, therefore, of the invention is to provide
a new and improved sealed electrical connector of the
character described.The invention is defined in claim 1.Generally, the sealed connector disclosed herein
includes a housing having
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A sealed electrical connector (14) which includes

a housing (40) having an interior cavity (26) for
sealingly receiving a mating connector (12),
latch means (32) for holding the connectors (12, 14)
in mated condition,
passageway means (50) communicating the interior
cavity (26) with the environment,
seal means (31) for sealing and closing the
passageway means (50) and,
release means (52) to release air entrapped in the
cavity (26) during mating of the connectors (12, 14),

characterized in that

   said release means (52) is operatively associated
between the latch means (32) and the seal means (31) for

acting upon the seal means (31) and opening the
passageway means (50) when said latch means (32) of the

sealed connector (14) is depressed.
The sealed electrical connector as set forth in claim 1,
wherein said latch means (32) comprises a latch arm (42)

having a latch boss (46) for latchingly engaging the
mating connector (12) and a leg (52) defining said

release means.
The sealed electrical connector as set forth in claim 2,
wherein said housing (40) is fabricated of molded

plastic material and said latch arm (42) is integrally
molded therewith.
The sealed electrical connector as set forth in claim 3,
wherein said latch arm (42) comprises a first and a

second end, said first end (44) being integrally molded 
with the housing (40) so as to have the arm

cantilevering and adapted to flex and have the second
end acting as said release means (52).
The sealed electrical connector as set forth in any of
claims 1 to 4, wherein said seal means (31) is snugly

fit within recess means (58) of the housing (40), said
passageway means (50) communicates with the recess means

(58), and said release means (52) is adapted for biasing
the seal means away from a wall of the recess means

(58).
The sealed electrical connector as set forth in any of
claims 2 to 5, wherein said latch arm (42) is a

resilient arm.
