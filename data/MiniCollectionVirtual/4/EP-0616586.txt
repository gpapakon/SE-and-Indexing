<ABSTRACT>
Either filled or empty cylindrical containers enter this labeling machine (10) upright on a conveyor (23) which slides beneath them as they are restrained and accumulated in a straight line against a gate (24) for individual admission to a synchronization wheel (25) and timed release between a series of moving parallel belts (26, 28) and stationary pads (27, 29) which laterally engage the container and propel it at various linear and rotational speeds during certain stages of the labeling operation so that the container achieves its greatest linear speeds before and after labeling, its slowest linear but greatest rotational speed during labeling, and moderate linear speeds to enter and exit the machine, thereby resulting in virtual label transfer within one container revolution while maintaining a constant and continuous high speed labeling operation therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Des i t i nAutomatic High-Speed Labeling Machine Employing Various Linear and Rotational Speeds of The ContainerTechnical Field This invention pertains to automatic high-speed labeling machines for labeling cylindr cal containers which are linearly fed through the machine in a straight line, but are caused to rotate about their vertical axes through a point of contact with a rotating cylindrical label transporting drum which results in the transfer of a label to a container and thereby causing the container to wrap said label around itself.Bac ground ArtThe prior art is replete with descriptions of labeling machines for cylindrical containers which all accomplish the same purpose but by different means.For example, in U.S. Patent 4,108,710 <1978), Hoffman describes a high-speed labeling apparatus for cans which are fed into and clamped onto the periphery of a rotating drum which moves individual cans past a first adhesive station where an adhesive is applied to each can at a predetermined location thereon and the cans are then moved on to a labeling station. Labels, previously cut from a continuous st ip, ar e held by a pour us rotating vacuum disc or drum whereon the trailing edge of said label receives adhesive and then it is moved into position where the leading edge of said label 

 engages a can at the location of adhesive on the can. As both can and label are moving in the same direction and at the same speed, the vacuum hold on the label is released thereby allowing the label to move away with the can to a wrapping station where the can is released and rolled along a track by a gripping conveyor belt thereby wrapping the label and its trailing edge around the can. This so-called "flagging" method of labeling was the state of the art for many years and was commonly used in the labeling of soup cans, however the flagging method, as described, is essentially limited to containers which can be gripped by the rotating drum in a manner that adhesive may be applied to the container while it travels through the machine for wrapping by a sturdy label such as paper.In U.S. Patent No. 4,500,386 1985), Hoffman discloses a "rollâ€”on" pad opposite and concentric to a rotating vacuum drum between which cylindrical containers are fed by a rotating star wheel. As the container comes into tangential contact with the rotating vacuum drum, a glue- containing label held on the drum is transferred to the container and the container is rotated about its vertical axis by the drum causing the label to be pressed onto

Clai s 1. An automatic high-speed labeling machine for labeling cylindrical containers, said machine comprising in ombinat ion: A. means for dispensing individual labels from a continuous strip of labeling material, said dispensing means comprising: a label unwind support disk for unwinding a roll of labeling material; a pair of label web guide rollers in combination with a label unwind brake control arm to keep the continuous strip of labeling material taut as it moves between them; a label drive wheel in tangential cooperation with a label drive tension wheel for pulling the continuous strip of labeling material from the label unwind support disk; a vacuum assisted rotating cutter head in cooperation with a cutting system engagement blade for cutting an individual label from its continuous strip of labeling material; a label transport wheel having a porous surface and internal vacuum causing the individual label to releasably adhere thereto as said label is received from the cutting system; a hotmelt glue applicator wheel in conjunction with a hotmelt glue pumping system for application of glue to the rear side of an individual label as it is turned on the label transport wheel to tangentially meet the side of an incoming container; B. means for receiving, propelling and discharging either filled or unfilled cylindrical containers traveling upright and in a straight line through the machine but at different linear and rotational speeds during various stages of the labeling operation, said means comprising: a linearly moving 



 conveyor chain for receiving containers upright but also sliding beneath said containers as they are' accumulated and forced against a product control gate in a straight line; a product control gate to regulate passage of individual containers to a container synchronization wheel; a container synchronization wheel turning clockwise to receive a container from the product control gate for properly timed release to a container drive belt; a container drive belt turning also clockwise but in partial parallel cooperation with a stationary infeed container drive pad for laterally receiving a container from the container synchronization wheel, but causing said container to begin slowly rotating counterclockwise as it is rapidly propelled linearly at the same speed as the container drive belt; a set of parallel upper and lower bottle spinning belts traveling clockwise but in slightly slower partial parallel cooperation with the container drive belt, all said belts laterally receiving a container from the stationary infeed container drive pad thereby causing it to rapidly rotate around its vertical axis but also slowing the container's linear speed as it approaches the label transport wheel, said label transport wheel with porous surface and internal vacuum for releasably holding a label while said wheel is turned at the same peripheral speed as the linear speed of the bottle spinning belts which causes tangential contact between the glue coating of the label thereon and rotating container thereby enabling the container to remove the label from said wheel and wrap the 


 label around itself in a linear distance traveled by the container as it makes essentially one revolution 'or in a linear distance traveled by the container equal to 107. of the label's length, whichever is less; a stationary discharge container compression pad parallel to and in cooperation with the moving container drive belt for receiving a labeled container from the label transport wheel and for causing said container to be rolled around its vertical axis thereby pressing the label firmly thereon, but also rapidly increasing the container's linear speed to quickly exit away from the label transport wheel by decreasing the rotational speed of said container; a linearly moving discharge conveyor chain for receiving labeled containers from the stationary discharge compression pad and container drive belt causing the containers to exit the machine.
2. An improved automatic high-speed labeling machine of the type in which opposite sides of upright cylindrical containers are engaged by parallel belts, one of which move in a slower linear direction than the other for rotating an linearly propelling containers tangentially past a rotating label transport means for transferring a label to a container, the improvement comprising:
A. a pair of stationary pads, one positioned linearly ahead of and the other positioned linearly behind the slower moving parallel belt, for laterally engaging one side of a container thereby causing its 1 inear speed to increase but its rotational speed to decrease as the container is rolled 


 along said pads for rapid entrance and exit from a label transport means; and wherein '
B. said rotating label transport means rotates at the same peripheral speed and in cooperation with the linear speed of the slower moving parallel belt for receiving a container and said container trapped between said parallel belts is forced to decrease its linear speed while increasing the container's rotational speed to equal that o the said rotating label transport means so that a container may lift and wrap a label around itself while essentially i tangential contact with said rotating label transport means.
3. The labeling machine of claim 2 including a timing means for releasing individual containers to said parallel belts.
4. The labeling machine of claim 2 wherein the rotating label transport means includes an internal vacuum means for holding labels until they are transferred to containers.
