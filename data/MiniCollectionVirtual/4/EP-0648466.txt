<ABSTRACT>
In a radiographic imaging apparatus and method capable 
of operation in a fluoroscopic mode, an operator inputs 

commands to control operation of the system including use 
of selectors (44, 70, 72, 74, 76). When in the 

fluoroscopic mode and based on the selected investigation, 
a specific fluoroscopic control procedure (62-62
n
) is 
selected from a fluoroscopic procedure storage (60) to 

control the values of kV and mA (and pulse width when in 
pulsed fluoroscopy) applied to an x-ray tube (A) producing 

the required radiation beam. By such a procedure, the 
image received by a video camera (22) and viewed on monitor 

(26) is optimized for each selected investigation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radiographic imaging
apparatus, more particularly radiographic imaging apparatus
capable of operating in a fluoroscopic mode.In a fluoroscopic/radiographic imaging system, a
radiation source such as an x-ray tube directs x-rays
through a patient onto an input surface of an image
intensifier tube. The image intensifier tube converts a
relatively large area of x-rays into a relatively small
brightened visual image which corresponds to the x-ray
pattern emerging from the patient. The image from the
image intensifier tube is converted to a video signal by a
video camera.In a fluoroscopic/radiographic imaging system, the
video signals from the video camera can be used in a
variety of manners. First, the video signals can be sent
directly to a viewing monitor which produces an image. In
another option, the video signals can be directed to a
variety of display processing components including digital
acquisition systems, video tape recorders, and video disc
recorders. These components digitize, enhance, and store
the video signals so that they may be played back on a
monitor at a later time.The x-ray tube includes an x-ray generator power
supply which provides both a voltage across the anode and
cathode of the x-ray tube in kilovolts (kV) and a filament 
current. The filament current heats the cathode filaments
boiling off electrons that are drawn by the voltage across
the cathode and anode toward the anode. The electron flow,
generally on the order of milliamps, is known as the tube
anode current or mA. The tube anode current (mA) is
controlled by adjusting the filament current. Both the
tube voltage or kV and the tube anode current or mA are
selectively adjustable. A timer times the selectable
duration of each exposure, normally measured in seconds
(s).The contrast of the x-ray image depends
significantly on the kV peak. The intensity of the x-ray
dose or exposure is proportional to the product of the
anode current mA and time at a given kV. This product is
commonly denoted as the mAs value. In operation, the
operator may set the kV value such that the resultant image
has a selected contrast. In a fully manual operation, the
operator commonly sets either the mAs value, or the anode
current and the exposure time in order to develop an x-ray
output. In theory, the resultant output, for a given kV
value, should be the same for a selected mAs value
regardless of whether a longer exposure time and a lower
anode current or shorter exposure time and a higher anode
current are
