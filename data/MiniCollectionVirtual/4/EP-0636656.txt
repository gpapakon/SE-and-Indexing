<ABSTRACT>
The properties of polyphenylene ether-polyarylene sulphide mixtures are 
improved by the addition of an agent as is known for the improvement of the 

properties of polyphenylene ether-polyamide mixtures, such as an aliphatic 
polycarboxylic acid or a derivative thereof. A suitable acid is citric acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a polymer mixture comprising a polyphenylene 
ether, a polyarylene sulfide and an agent to improve the homogeneity as used 
for polyphenylene ether-polyamide polymer mixture. Polyphenylene ether-polyamide mixtures 
are described in various patent publications: 
US-A-4,021,596; JP-A-55/129422 (see WPI Acc. No. 
80-83415 C/47); JP-A-62/065351 (see WPI Acc. No. 
80-120241/17); JP-A-55/135160 (see WPI Acc. No. 
80-87164C/49); JP-A-50/156,561 (see CA, Vol. 84, 1976, 
page 35, No. 84:106514 v). Polymer mixtures comprising a polyphenylene ether and a polyarylene 
sulphide have a combination of properties which each of the individual 
components does not have, for example, a combination of certain mechanical 
properties, a good resistance against organic solvents, a better processability 
and flame-retarding properties. In accordance with the desired combination of 
properties, the two polymers were used in a variety of mixing ratios. The disadvantage of the known polymer mixtures is that the two 
polymers do not form a homogeneous mixture. Products manufactured, for 
example, from these polymer mixtures by injection moulding, show a tendency 
of delamination. This often leads to a surface having pearl gloss. It also often 
appears that the addition of further additives, for example, agents to improve 
the impact strength, to non-homogeneous polymer mixtures, only results in a 
small improvement of the properties. The invention provides polymer mixtures which have a better 
homogeneity. The invention is based on the discovery that aliphatic polycarboxylic 
acids or derivatives thereof as defined in claim 1 are suitable agent to improve 
the homogeneity. EP-A-262901 describes polymer blends comprising as dispersing phase a polyphenylene ether, a crystalline 
thermoplastic resin matrix phase and a mutual compatibiliser. 
The crystalline thermoplastic resin can be a polyphenylene sulfide. 
The mutual compatibiliser can be chosen among a great number of 
compounds for example unsaturated acids such as fumaric acid.  
 The polymer mixture according to the invention is characterised in that it 
comprises as an agent to improve the homogeneity aliphatic polycarboxylic 
acids or derivatives thereof of the general formula: 
(R1O)m R(COOR2)n(CONR3R4)s, wherein R is a saturated hydrocarbon group 
having 2 to 20 carbon atoms with a linear or branched chain; R1 is a hydrogen 
atom or an alkyl group, aryl group, acyl group or carbonyldioxy group having 1 
to 10 carbon atoms; each R2 independently of
