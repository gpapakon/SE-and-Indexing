<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a peristaltic pump of the type 
having a flexible tube (3) stretched over a roller 

assembly comprising a number of rollers (2a, 2b) 
mounted on a rotatable support (1), the tube being 

stretched over the roller assembly in such a manner 
that where the tube is compressed against a roller it 

is occluded and rotation of the roller assembly causes 
fluid contained in the tube and trapped by occlusion to 

be moved along the tube, wherein the tube extends 
through substantially 360째 around the roller assembly. 
There is also disclosed a humidity control system 
using such a pump and an incubator using such a 

humidity control system.

<DESCRIPTION>
Peristaltic pumps are well known and are used for 
various applications where a fluid is required to be 
pumped through a tube. Peristaltic pumps are able to 
control the flow rate of the fluid through the tube and 
can allow it to be dispensed in precise discrete 
volumes. Peristaltic pumps are considered advantageous 
as there is no contact between the fluid and the pump 
so contamination is avoided, back flow of liquids 
through the pump is inherently prevented and stripping 
and cleaning of the pump is not required - merely the 
quick and easy rinsing or exchanging of the tube. There are two main types of known peristaltic 
pump. In the first the pumping action is achieved by 
compressing a flexible tube between rotating rollers 
and a fixed, profiled former. The fixed former is 
often semi-circular and the flexible tube is fixed so 
that it lies against the inside of the semi-circular 
shape. Rollers, usually two or three in number, are 
mounted on a rotating assembly concentric with the 
semi-circular former such that the tube is compressed 
by each roller in turn by the rotation of the assembly, 
which causes fluid trapped between two or more 
occlusions to be moved through the tube in the 
direction of rotation of the assembly. Such pumps 
require a considerable accuracy of manufacture to 
ensure that the correct clearances are maintained to 
completely occlude the tube without causing unnecessary 
deformation. The second type of peristaltic pump, which is 
generally the one used for low duty applications, is 
where occlusion of the tube is achieved by stretching 
it over a rotating assembly consisting of three or four 
rollers. In this case it is the tension in the tube 
which causes the compression against the roller and 
thus the occlusion. This system, although much simpler  
 
in construction, has certain disadvantages. A fairly 
high tension is required to ensure occlusion of the 
tube and, since the tube is usually stretched only over 
one side of the roller assembly the tension causes 
appreciable side loading on the roller assembly, and 
its bearing shaft and associated motor, shortening the 
pump's useful life and increasing torque requirements. The present invention overcomes or substantially 
mitigates the problems associated with known 
peristaltic pumps. According to a first aspect of the present 
invention there is provided a peristaltic pump of the 
type having a flexible tube stretched over a roller 
assembly comprising a number of rollers mounted on a 
rotatable support, the
