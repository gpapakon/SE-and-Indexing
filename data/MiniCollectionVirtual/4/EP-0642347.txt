<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF 2-HALO ADENINE DERIVATIVESAS THERAPEUTIC AGENTS AGAINSTCHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIADescriptionTechnical FieldThis invention relates to a novel treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia. More particularly, this invention relates to a process for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia involving the administration of a 2-halo-2'-deoxyadenosine.Background of the InventionAn adult human has about 7000 white blood cells per microliter (μl) of blood. Of those white cells, about 65 percent are granulocytes (about 4500/μl) , about 30 percent are monocytes (about 2100/μl) and about five percent are lymphocytes (about 350/μl) . Gey on. Textbook of Medical Physioloσv. Seventh ed. , .B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia (1986). The above cell numbers are, of course, generalized average values, and granulocyte counts for normal patients; i.e., patients that do not have DML or a similar disease exhibiting an increased or decreased granulocyte count, typically have granulocyte counts ranging from about 2000 to about 7000 cells/μl.Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) , also known as chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) , is a neoplastic disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell. In its early phases it is characterized by leukocytosis, the presence 

of increased numbers of immature granulocytes in the peripheral blood, splenomegaly and anemia. These immature granulocytes include basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils. The immature granulocytes also accumulate in the bone marrow, spleen, liver, and occasionally in other tissues. Patients presenting with this disease characteristically have more than 75,000 white blood cells per microliter (μl) , and the count may exceed 500,000/μl. CML accounts for about 20 percent of all leukemias in the United States. About 15 new cases per million people are reported each year, leading to about 3r000 to 4,000 new cases per year. The disease is rare in humans below age 45, rises rapidly to age 65, and remains high thereafter. The median life span of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia from the time of diagnosis is approximately four years.Patients with chronic CML have usually been treated with alkylating agents such as busulfan or by treatment with hydroxyurea. In recent years treatment with α-interferon has been used.These therapeutic agents can have serious side effects. For example, busulfan can cause a serious complication known as "busulfan lung" that leads to bronchopulmonary dysplasia with pulmonary fibrosis.Although these therapeutic agents improve the quality of

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A process for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia that comprises administering to a host mammal having chronic myelogenous leukemia a therapeutically effective amount of a substituted adenosine derivative as an active ingredient dissolved or dispersed in a pharmacologically acceptable carrier, said adenosine derivative having a structure represented by the formula:
wherein Y is halogen, and X is hydrogen or fluoro.
2. The process of claim 1 wherein Y is chlorine.
3. The process of claim 2 wherein X is hydrogen.
4. The process of claim 1 wherein said administering provides said adenosine derivative in the plasma of said host mammal in an amount of about 0.04 to about 1.0 milligrams per kilogram of host mammal body weight per day. 


 6. The process of claim 1 wherein said adenosine derivative is administered parenterally.
7. The process of claim 1 wherein said host mammal is a human.
8. A process for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia that comprises administering to a human having chronic myelogenous leukemia an amount of about 0.04 to about 1.0 milligrams per kilogram of body weight of a substituted adenosine derivative as an active ingredient dissolved or dispersed in a pharmacologically acceptable carrier, said adenosine derivative having a structure represented by the formula:
wherein X is hydrogen or fluoro.
8. The process of claim 7 wherein X is hydrogen.
9. The process of claim 8 wherein said administering provides said adenosine derivative in the plasma of said host mammal in an amount of about 0.05 to about 0.20 milligrams per kilogram of host mammal body weight per day. 


 10. The process of claim 9 wherein said adenosine derivative is administered parenterally.
