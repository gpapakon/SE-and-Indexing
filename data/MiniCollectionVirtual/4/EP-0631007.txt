<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a method of producing a melt spun synthetic 
polymeric filament which has the superior deep dyeability thereof. 

The method includes the steps of application of a dye dispersed in 
water to the filaments during the drawing of the filament, and heat 

setting the surface dyed filaments to uniformly diffuse the 
throughout the total cross section of the filaments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for dyeing
melt spun synthetic polymeric filaments. The process of the
present invention is used to produce a highly oriented filament
having a uniform dyed cross-section.It is well known in the art that dyeing melt spun synthetic
polymer filament is affected by numerous variables including
drawing and heat treating of the filaments as well as the selected
dyeing process. Each of these processes are interrelated and
necessary for production of melt spun synthetic polymeric
filaments.Generally it is known to produce melt spun synthetic
polymeric filaments by the steps of melt spinning the polymer to
form filaments, drawing the filaments to obtain desired tensile and
thermal properties, annealing the filaments, crimping and drying
the filaments. It is well known that annealing of the filaments 
may be combined with the drying the filaments at elevated
temperatures.Drawing occurs when the melt spun filaments are elongated.
In particular, drawing is defined as the stretching of continuous
filament yarn or tow to increase the average axial alignment of the
polymer molecules of the filament resulting in improved tensile and
thermal properties. Such yarns are termed drawn or tensilized
yarns.During the drawing process the polymer molecules in the
filament or fibers become oriented and more closely packed
generally referred to as orientation in the filaments. This
increases the specific strength and modulus of the filaments. The
actual amount of drawing necessary is determined by the amount of
orientation developed in the spinning process and also by the level
of tenacity desired in the final product. For example, in
US-A-3,216,187, Chantry et al describe a polyester process
designed to minimize orientation in the melt spun polyester yarn
and then the use of high draw ratios, e.g. 6.7:1, to obtain a very
strong yarn for use in, for example, reinforcing automobile tires.
Conversely, U.S. Patent 4,134,882 describes spinning at very high
stresses to maximize spun yarn birefringence or spun molecular
orientation and thereby minimize or eliminate the drawing step. Generally, drawing is done at a temperature of the tow from
60°C to 80°C i.e. at temperatures near the glass
transition temperature of the polymer.Further improvements in yarn strength and shrinkage
characteristics result from annealing the drawn yarns at
temperatures significantly above their glass transition
temperatures. Generally, annealing of polyester filaments occurs
immediately subsequent to the drawing

<CLAIMS>
A process for dyeing of melt spun synthetic filaments selected
from poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(trimethylene terephthalate),

poly(tetramethylene terephthalate), copolymers thereof and
polyamide consisting essentially of the steps of:


application of a disperse dye dispersed in water to said
melt spun synthetic filaments resulting in surface dyed

filaments; then
drawing the surface dyed filaments forming drawn filaments;
then
annealing said drawn filaments at a temperature from 75 °C
to 240 °C for up to 10 seconds to evaporate the water from

the filament surface, and to affix said dye to the surface
of the filament forming surface dyed drawn filaments; and

heat setting said surface dyed drawn filaments at a temperature
from 100 °C to 180 °C for at least 10 minutes to

uniformly diffuse the dye throughout the total cross-section
of the filament.
The process of claim 1 wherein said filament is annealed from
190 °C to 210 °C for 5 seconds and heat set from 160 °C to 180 °C

for 10 minutes.
