<ABSTRACT>
A conditioning shampoo containing an anionic 
surfactant, a long-chain fatty alcohol, a cationic 

polyethyleneimine, and optionally a non-volatile 
silicone material has extended product stability, 

excellent cleansing and foaming properties, and 
provides excellent and improved overall conditioning to 

human hair, particularly superior wet and dry combing 
properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a hair
conditioning shampoo composition and to a method of
treating hair with the composition to cleanse the hair
and, at the same time, to provide the hair with
improved wet-stage and dry-stage conditioning
properties as well as other conditioning properties,
such as softness, without residual buildup of
conditioning agents on the hair. More particularly,
the present invention is directed to a hair
conditioning shampoo composition including one or more
anionic cleaning surfactants, such as ammonium lauryl
sulfate; one or more non-volatile silicone oils, such
as a polydimethylsiloxane compound; a long-chain fatty
alcohol, preferably predominantly C12, C14, and/or C16
fatty alcohol(s); and a cationic (protonated)
polyethyleneimine. Surprisingly, the combination of
one or more long-chain (C8-C18) fatty alcohols, and a
cationic polyethyleneimine effectively increases foam
volume and conditioning properties while maintaining
excellent cleansing in a composition that is stable
over extended periods of time at elevated temperatures. Soiled human hair is shampooed to remove
sebum that is naturally secreted by the head, as well
as soil and other atmospheric contaminants that
accumulate on the hair. Sebum, in particular,
accumulates on the hair in a relatively short period of
time leaving the hair with a greasy, dirty feel and
poor manageability. The most effective shampoos for
cleansing the hair for removal of the atmospheric
contaminants and sebum are those that contain high
lather synthetic anionic detergents, such as the long-chain
alkyl sulfates and the partially ethoxylated
long-chain alkyl sulfates. These synthetic anionic
detergents are very effective for cleansing the hair
but, after rinsing with water, leave the hair with a
dried touch, usually called "creak" and result in hair,
when wet, that is in an extremely tangled and
unmanageable after-shampoo condition.Thoroughly cleansed hair is extremely
difficult to comb in either the wet or dry state
because the individual hair fibers tend to snarl, kink,
and interlock with each other. Particularly prior to
complete drying of thoroughly cleansed hair in this
after-shampoo stage the hair is very difficult to comb
or brush. Even after complete drying, the thoroughly
cleansed hair remains difficult to comb or brush and
does not set well. Thoroughly clean, dried hair also
has undesirable electrostatic properties in a low
humidity atmosphere that causes the hair to "fly away,"
thereby further reducing the combing or brushing

<CLAIMS>
A hair conditioning shampoo composition
comprising an emulsion of water; about 5 to about 65

percent by weight of an anionic cleaning surfactant;
from 2 to 10 weight percent of a long-chain

fatty alcohol having predominantly 8 to
18 carbons in the long chain; and from about 0.01

to 4.0 weight percent of a cationic
polyethyleneimine, said composition having a pH of

4 to 8.
The composition
according to Claim 1, further including 0.1 to

about 10% by weight silicone conditioning agent.
The composition according to Claims 1
or 2, wherein the polyethyleneimine is included in

an amount of 0.01% to 1% by weight.
The composition according to anyone of
Claims 1 to 3, wherein said long-chain fatty

alcohol is present in an amount of 2 to 5
weight percent of said composition
The composition of anyone of Claims 2 to 4, wherein the
silicone has a viscosity at 25°C of at least 5

centistokes and a boiling point at 760 mm Hg pressure
and 25°C of at least 250°C. 
The composition of anyone of Claims 1 to 5 wherein the
anionic cleaning surfactant is selected from the group

consisting of alkyl sulfates; alkyl sulfonates; alkyl
ether sulfates and alkyl ether sulfonates.
The composition of anyone of Claims 1 to 6, wherein the
cationic polyethyleneimine has a weight average

molecular weight in the range of 700 to
70,000. 
A method of shampooing and conditioning
hair which comprises applying to said hair the

composition of anyone of Claims 1 to 7.
A method of manufacturing the
conditioning shampoo composition of anyone of Claims 1 to 7

comprising:

heating a mixture of water, an
anionic surfactant and a cationic

polyethyleneimine to a temperature
above the melting point of a fatty

alcohol;
adding the fatty alcohol to
said mixture until said alcohol is

completely melted to form an
aqueous fatty alcohol and

polyethyleneimine surfactant
solution;
adding a silicone conditioning
agent to said solution to form a

two-phase composition; and
vigorously agitating the two-phase
composition to break up the

silicone into droplets and suspend
said silicone droplets.
