<ABSTRACT>
A synchronous adder is used for clock synchronisation in
a multicarrier receiver. In a system with four subcarriers, the I

and Q components of the respective subcarriers are squared and fed
into the adder. In this way an envelope signal is formed, which is

used for the clock synchronisation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a synchronous
adder device for making synchronous addition for
the power of a sampled receive signal for symbol identification,
for example, in a receiver for digital
communication, and more particularly to such a synchronous
adder device which is realized with small circuit
scale.On a receiving side in the digital communication,
a receive signal level at a point of time
corresponding to the instant of time of transmission of
a symbol ("1" or "0") on a transmitting side is extracted
from a receive signal. The extracted signal
level is compared in magnitude with a threshold value
to reproduce an original symbol.In the case where digital data is transmitted
in a narrow band, transmission with Nyquist characteristic
is made and both a transmitting side and a
receiving side generally use filters which have the
same Nyquist characteristic. In such digital transmission,
so long as a limiter amplifier is not used as a
receiving amplifier, a symbol timing for extracting a
symbol from a receive signal can be obtained from a 
point at which an envelope of the receive signal becomes
the maximum.On the receiving side, the receive signal is
digitized at a sampling frequency which is N (integer)
times as high as a symbol clock (or symbol transmission
frequency). Thereafter, the square value of each
sample is calculated and the square value for every
N-th sample in such digitized samples is subjected to
synchronous addition so that the every N-th sample providing
the maximum value of addition is detected as a
sample representing a transmit symbol.In the digital communication, multivalued
transmission using a plurality of subcarriers with
carrier frequencies slightly shifted from a center
frequency is made in order to improve the efficiency of
communication. In the case of this communication
system, the performance of detection of a symbol timing
can be improved by using the sum of envelopes of the
respective subcarriers.The conventional synchronous adder device
for performing the above-mentioned synchronous addition
is shown in Fig. 1. The device includes an A/D converter
2 for digitizing an in-phase component (or I
signal) 1 of a receive signal for each subcarrier at a
sampling frequency which is N times as high as a symbol
clock, an A/D converter 4 for digitizing an orthogonal
component (or Q signal) 3 of the receive signal for
each subcarrier at the above-mentioned sampling frequency, 
frequency converters 7 to 10 for performing
frequency conversion corresponding to the respective
su
