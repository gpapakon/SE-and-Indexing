<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel group of imidazole compounds, processes for
the preparation thereof, the use thereof in treating cytokine mediated diseases and
pharmaceutical compositions for use in such therapy.There has been much interest in the past few years in compounds which are
cytokine-inhibitors, for use in treating disease states which are associated with the
excessive or unregulated production of cytokines. Compounds of the general formula
(A):
Wherein Ra is pyridyl, Rb is optionally substituted phenyl and W is a partially or fully
unsaturated fused 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring, such as pyrrolyl, pyridyl,
dihydropyrrolyl, dihydropyridinyl, dihydrothiazolyl or tetrahydrotriazinyl, are inhibitors
of the cytokines IL-1 and TNF (see WO88/01169, WO90/15534, WO91/00092,
WO92/10190, WO92/10498 and WO92/12154, published after the filing of this
application). In addition, these compounds are also inhibitors of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase.
We have now surprisingly found that if the ring W is replaced by certain
substituents at the 2-position, cytokine-inhibitory activity is maintained. Such
compounds are generically 2-substituted-4-aryl-5-heteroaryl-imidazoles. Compounds
within this class have already been extensively investigated, as anti-inflammatory
agents, acting principally as cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, as described in, for instance,
US patents 3,707,405 and 3,929,807. The latter discloses compounds of the general
formula (B):
Wherein one of Ra and Rb is optionally substituted phenyl and the other is a 6-membered
heterocyclic ring with 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms and Rc represents lower alkyl,
cycloalkyl or phenyl optionally substituted by halogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy, in
particular the compound 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-imidazole.
These compounds are said to have 
anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. There is however no mention that
these compounds may be cytokine inhibitors.Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I):

wherein:
R1 is 4-pyridyl;
R2 is hydrogen, OH or methyl;
R3 is phenyl substituted at the 4-position with a substituent selected from
-(CR10R20)nY2 wherein n is 0, 1,2 or 3 and Y2 is -OR8, -S(O)m'R11,, -NR8R9,-C(O)R8,
-CN, -NR10S(O)mR11;
m is 2;
m' is 1;
R4 is phenyl or phenyl substituted at the 4-position with tluoro and/or substituted at
the 3-position with fluoro, chloro, C1-4 alkoxy, methane-sulfonamido or acetamido;
R8 is hydrogen;
R9 is hydrogen;
R10 is hydrogen;
R11 is methyl;
R20 is hydrogen;
