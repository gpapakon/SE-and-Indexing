<ABSTRACT>
An electrical protection device is formed by the association of a circuit breaker (12) having a first switching circuit (16) and of an effector (14) having a second switching circuit (18), which is connected to the fixed contact (20) by a first linking region (50), and to a change-over switching electrode (38) by a second linking region (42). An insulating gap (42) separates the electrode (38) from the fixed contact (20), and the moving contact (22) is connected to the input terminal (28) via the bimetallic thermal trigger (26). The electrode (38) is connected to one of the ends (34a) of the coil (34) of the electromagnetic trigger (36), the other end (34b) being linked to the output terminal (32). The effector (14) has no voltage applied in the open state of the circuit breaker. Excitation of the coil (34) is maintained during the phase of shunting of the effector (14) when the arc migrates on the change-over switching electrode (38).
