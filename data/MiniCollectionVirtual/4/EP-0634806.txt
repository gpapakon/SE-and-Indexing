<ABSTRACT>
In an antenna attached to a casing of a radio apparatus, 
the antenna is used being extended during communication 

but retracted during no-communication. The antenna 
includes a first coil-shaped antenna element (10) and a second 

rod-shaped antenna element (14), and these two antenna elements 
are coupled to each other via a trap circuit (12,16,18;40,50). When 

extended, both the first and second antenna elements (10,14) 
project outside the casing, so that only the second antenna 

element (14) is connected to a radio circuit via a feeding 
member. When retracted, the second antenna element (14) is kept 

inside the casing and only the first antenna element (10) is 
kept outside the casing, so that only the first antenna 

element (10) is connected to the radio circuit via the feeding 
member (30). The trap circuit (50) is a parallel resonance circuit 

composed of a capacitance (40) and an inductance (12). The resonance 
frequency of the trap circuit is determined to be an 

intermediate value between those of the first and second 
antenna elements. Owing to the presence of the trap 

circuit, both the first and second antenna elements can 
function independently.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio antenna, and 
more specifically to a radio antenna suitable for use with 
a radio apparatus for transmitting and/or receiving two 
signals of different frequencies (e.g., as a call signal 
frequency and a communication signal frequency). In more 
practical way, the present invention relates to a radio 
antenna which can be extended and retracted so as to be 
suitable for a portable radio apparatus and further which 
can receive a call signal under the condition that the 
antenna is kept retracted within a casing of the radio 
apparatus. In the radio apparatus such as a portable telephone 
set, recently, there exist the following features: two 
different frequencies are used for a call signal and a 
communication signal; the radio apparatus casing is reduced 
in size so as to be suitable for a portable apparatus; and 
in addition the antenna is extended only during communication 
but retracted when not used for communication. 
Furthermore, it is required for the radio apparatus to 
receive a call signal when the antenna is kept retracted 
in the apparatus casing. An example of these conventional radio antennas is 
disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined (Kokai) Application 
No. 3-245603. In this conventional radio antenna, a 
coil-shaped antenna element is connected to a rod-shaped 
antenna element; the rod-shaped antenna element is housed 
inside a casing so as to be extensible and retractable from 
and into the casing; when the antenna is extended, the base 
end portion of the rod-shaped antenna element is brought 
into elastic contact with a feeding member at the feeding 
point; and when the antenna is retracted, only the coil-shaped  
 
antenna element is left projected outside the casing 
and further the base end portion of the coil-shaped element 
is brought into elastic contact with the feeding member. The above-mentioned conventional radio antenna is 
suitable for a portable radio apparatus because the antenna 
can receive a call signal under the condition that the 
antenna is kept retracted. However, the conventional radio 
antenna involves the following drawbacks: since the coil-shaped 
antenna element and the rod-shaped antenna element 
are kept connected to each other irrespective of when the 
antenna is kept extended or retracted, the feeding point 
is different from each other between when the antenna is 
kept extended and retracted. Therefore, the output 
impedance of the antenna at the feeding point changes 
according to the extension and
