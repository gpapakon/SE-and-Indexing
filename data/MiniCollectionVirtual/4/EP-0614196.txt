<ABSTRACT>
The contaminated concrete floors or walls or brick walls are first cleaned of dust and loose particles by means of a vacuum cleaner. Subsequently, dilute phosphoric acid in a concentration of preferably 5 % is applied to the surface to be decontaminated by means of a brush or roller or by means of an atomiser. During a time of about 5-10 minutes, this phosphoric acid reacts with the calcium-containing substrate to form a foam which consists essentially of water, mobile particles and tricalcium phosphates. By means of an apparatus, the contaminants which have been released and held in the mobile phase are brushed off and simultaneously sucked off.
