<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and method for
ultrasonic sealing disposable diapers and, more particularly, to
sealing with an orbitally movable horn and anvil.It is known that ultrasonic sealing is commonly used in
many applications to weld various types of web materials
together. A majority of these applications utilize a stationary
mounted ultrasonic member (power supply, converter, booster,
horn) in connection with a rotating patterned anvil roll
member. The horn is the part of the vibratory or ultrasonic
member that comes in contact with the product and effects
sealing in combination with the anvil. The vibratory energy is
transferred directly to the webs as they pass through these
members causing them to melt and bond to each other. This
approach, because of its tangential contact time, is limited to
speeds and construction that require a minimal seal time. An example of this type of apparatus is shown in document GB-A-2 257 652
on which the pre-characterising parts of claim 1 and 11 are based.One current apparatus employs a shuttle mechanism to
increase sealing time. The vibratory member clamps down on the
web with an anvil member underneath and travels with the web for
a predetermined distance where it releases -- having sealed a
specific area -- and returns to the starting point for another
cycle. This is a chain drive system with complicated dynamics
which makes it difficult to control.Ultrasonic sealing on the fly has been successful
because of the small area that the vibratory member has been
required to seal, i.e., tangential contact to the patterned
anvil roller. The drawbacks to this system are limited web
speed, the product orientation required for a good seal and is
limited to putting a good seal only on small areas.The problem is that many product constructions, such as
training pants, require a substantial increase in seal time due
to the multiple webs and the increased sealing area. To run
these on present systems would require a slower web feed rate
making it more costly and changing the orientation of the web or
product as it passes.The invention
which is more particularly set out in the appended claims
solves the above shortcomings by applying
orbital motion to the ultrasonic member. Optionally there may also be an adjusting
of the centerline distance between them. This varies the distance
traveled while the horn and anvil are in contact.This adjustment allows the two members to contact the
web at various angular positions and travel with the web,
resulting in an increase in
