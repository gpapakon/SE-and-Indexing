<ABSTRACT>
In conjunction with the diagnosis of conditions in and 
treatment of the lungs, a small amount of NO is supplied to 

the lungs in some cases. A gas mixture is used according to 
the invention, in which an inert, non-toxic trace gas is 

present in an exact concentration in relation to NO, in 
order to simply and safely control the amount of NO then 

supplied to the lungs. The amount of NO supplied can be 
determined here by determining the concentration of trace 

gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas mixture intended for
delivery, together with a breathing gas, to the lungs of a
living being, said gas mixture containing a pre-defined
concentration of NO.The invention also relates to a device for supplying a predetermined
amount of NO to the lungs of a living being.All exchanges between blood gases and the atmosphere take
place in the lungs, more particularly in the pulmonary alveoli.
When the lungs are defective or diseased, the pulmonary
alveoli may be afflicted by dysfunction which impairs or
prevents the exchange of gas between the blood and the
atmosphere. This is also the case in defects or disease
affecting blood vessels in the lungs. Resistance to the flow
of blood through the lungs could then increase, thereby
increasing the load on the heart. Very small amounts of
nitric oxide (NO) can be supplied to the lungs in order to
diagnose pulmonary function and treat the lungs. Nitric
oxide relaxes smooth muscle in blood vessels and bronchi.
Relaxation of the vascular musculature increases the flow of
blood through the vessels, thereby improving the exchange of
gas between the blood and the atmosphere and reducing the
load on the heart. Resistance to flow through the lungs can
be determined by measuring the pressure in the pulmonary
artery. As a result, the effect of NO administration can be
directly measured. If no effect is measurable, the capillaries
are either already fully dilated or heavily calcificated.
Relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchi counteracts
bronchospasm and asthma. Nitric oxide gas also diffuse
through the lung membrane and can be absorbed by the blood
in unlimited quantities, in principle, thereby making it 
possible to measure the diffusion capacity of the lungs by
determining the amount of diffused nitric oxide. NO can also
be used in different types of respiratory treatment of
adults and children and in the monitoring of respiratory
treatment and other diagnostic measures.In WO 92/10228 the use and effects of NO are described in
detail. The document also describes how NO in a mixture of
N2 and O2 can be delivered to a patient's lung with a ventilator.In EP-A- 0 570 612 is described a device for delivering very
small gas flows to a patient. An accurate concentration of
e.g. NO can be supplied to a patient's lungs with a very
small flow of gas.Since the amounts of nitric oxide supplied are very small,
i.e. generally from one or two ppm up to about 100 ppm,
measuring the concentration of nitric oxide supplied to a
patient's lungs is
