<ABSTRACT>
A method of fabricating a microfuse, deletable by laser 
pulses utilizes laser pulses of a predetermined spot diameter 

and beam alignment accuracy. A fusible link forming 
a portion of the microfuse is defined such that its length 

is at least equal to the sum of the laser spot diameter 
and the beam alignment accuracy and its width is no greater 

than half the laser spot diameter. A method of deleting 
the microfuse (20) by laser (30) pulses is provided 

where the microfuse has a predetermined composition, 
length and width having an axis bisecting the width and 

parallel to the length and is covered with a passivation 
layer at least 3 µm thick. The method includes adjusting 

the diameter (D) of the beam of laser light (32) first to 
at least a minimum diameter of W + Δ P
W
, where W equals 
the width of the microfuse fuse link and Δ P
W
 equals the 
accuracy of the beam in the direction of W and second to 

no more than a maximum diameter of L + Δ P
L
, where L 
equals the length of the microfuse fuse link and Δ P
L
 
equals the accuracy of the beam in the direction of L.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the fabrication 
and laser deletion of microfuses and more particularly to 
a process for fabricating a microfuse within an integrated 
circuit and deleting such microfuse by one or more laser 
pulses. The use of microfuses in digital integrated circuits is 
well known for the purpose of selectively disconnecting 
unwanted components from the circuit. A known technique 
for deleting such fuses from the circuit involves the 
application of a laser light beam to the microfuse fuse 
link having sufficient energy to melt the fuse link. Such 
a technique has traditionally involved reducing or removing 
any passivation oxide present over the fuse link 
structure, thereby creating a window to facilitate the 
deletion of the fuse. During the fuse-deletion process, a 
crater is typically formed exposing the remains of the 
disintegrated fuse to the surrounding area. This process 
has the potential to cause many adverse effects to the 
portion of the integrated circuit in proximity to the 
deleted fuse, such as delamination of the circuit, contamination 
of the circuit with deleted particles, and corrosion. 
In addition, it has been difficult to obtain a 
satisfactory yield of deleted fuses using such prior techniques. A feature of the present invention is the provision of a 
process for deleting microfuses from an integrated circuit 
structure with a laser light source which eliminates the 
need for opening a window to gain access to the fuse.  Another feature of the present invention is the provision 
of such a method of deleting a microfuse for interconnecting 
the components of an integrated circuit in a desired 
manner which yields a high rate of deleted fuses. A further feature of the present invention is the provision 
of such a method of deleting microfuses for interconnecting 
the components of an integrated circuit in a desired 
manner which eliminates adverse effects to the surrounding 
integrated circuit areas such as delamination, 
contamination, and corrosion. Yet another feature of the present invention is a method 
of fabricating a microfuse which is deletable by laser 
pulses of a predetermined spot diameter and beam alignment 
accuracy to achieve the aforementioned features. Accordingly, a method of fabricating a microfuse deletable 
by laser pulses of a predetermined spot diameter and beam 
alignment accuracy is provided for interconnecting the 
components of an integrated circuit in a desired manner. 
The method includes the steps of: (a) depositing a
