<ABSTRACT>
An electronic equipment, such as a recording and/or reproducing 
apparatus for recording and/or reproducing an information signal in 

and/or from a recording medium, includes a drive mechanism portion 
(40), a chassis (2), an upper lid (12), a lower lid (11), a panel frame 

(13) and a battery compartment portion (5). The chassis (2) is shaped 
as substantially square and frame by bending a band-shaped sheet metal. 

The chassis (2) supports therein the drive mechanism portion (40) 
through a damping mechanism. The upper lid (12) is made of a metal 

material and attached to one surface side of the chassis (2) so as to 
open and/or close the drive mechanism portion (40). The lower lid (11) 

is made of a metal material and attached to the chassis (2) so as to 
close the other surface of the chassis (2). The panel frame (13) is 

substantially U-letter in shape and made of a synthetic resin. The 
panel frame (13) has a plurality of operation buttons (18) provided 

thereon and is attached to the outside of the chassis (2). The battery 
compartment portion (5) has substantially the same thickness obtained 

under the condition that the lower lid (11) is attached to the chassis 
(2) and that the drive mechanism portion (40) is closed by the upper 

lid (12). The battery compartment portion (5) is made of a metal 
material and attached to one side wall of the chassis (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electronic equipment
and, particularly to electronic equipment having a
chassis.Recently, for electronic equipments, such as disc
players or tape cassette players, small and thin electronic
equipments that are excellent in portability are now very
popular on the market.To make these portable electronic equipments small and
thin, it has been proposed to simplify a drive mechanism portion
of electronic equipment as much as possible. However, there is
a limit to such efforts to simplify the drive mechanism portion
of the electronic equipment.Under the above-mentioned situation, to make these
portable electronic equipments smaller and thinner, it is
proposed to simplify the structure of a chassis on which the
drive mechanism portion is supported.However, if the chassis is simplified in structure, then
the chassis is lowered in strength. Therefore, it is not
possible to provide electronic equipments that can be used
satisfactorily in actual practice. European Patent Specification No. 0528420 discloses a disk
loading system for a disk recording/reproducing system. The loading
system includes a base plate that carries a disk drive, and a cartridge
holder pivotally attached to said base plate. A battery compartment is
also provided.According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided
electronic apparatus comprising:
a substantially square chassis;a drive mechanism supported on the interior of the chassis; anda battery compartment connected to the chassis, one or more
batteries being receivable in said compartment to power the apparatus;
   characterised in that:
said battery compartment is of rigid material and is connected to
the outside of the chassis; andin that said chassis is annular and comprises a u-shaped unitary
member bent from sheet metal and having an open end, a cross-piece
being attached to the u-shaped unitary member to close the open end
thereof, said battery compartment being attached to the outside of a
wall of said chassis to inhibit flexure of said chassis.Since the chassis is made frame in shape by bending the sheet
metal, even when the chassis structure is simplified, it is possible to
increase rigidity of the chassis by attaching the battery compartment
portion to the chassis as a rigid member. Since the chassis which
supports thereon the drive mechanism portion is simplified in
structure, the electronic equipment can be miniaturized and made
thinner.The invention is diagrammatically illustrated by way of example
in the accompanying drawings, in which:-
