<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for the kinematic high-frequency treatment of a material or material mixture is arranged in the form of a cylindrical arrangement of at least two comminuting-member rings seated on holders, surrounding one another and rotatable in opposite directions relative to one another, the outer comminuting-member ring (5) having teeth (8) and the inner comminuting-member ring (3) having at least two outer faces (7), and a working gap (6) being defined between the inner faces of the teeth and the outer faces of the inner comminuting-member ring. The inner faces (9a, 9b) of the teeth (8) and the outer faces (7) of the inner comminuting-member ring (3) each have two edges (58 and 10a), and the working gap (6) has, at least in places, non-parallel regions. Such an apparatus results in a higher efficiency than previously known apparatuses and, above all, in the case of solid/liquid systems, solid fractions can be processed with larger diameters and without prior coarse grinding.

<CLAIMS>
Device for the kinematic high-frequency treatment of a
material or a mixture of materials, comprising


an outer support for a cylindrical crown of outer
comminution teeth (8, 13, 22, 27, 31);
an inner support (1, 3, 10, 49, 51, 53) for inner
comminution teeth (3, 33, 37, 38, 39);
the crown of outer teeth surrounding the inner teeth;
the inner surfaces of the outer teeth (8, 13, 22, 27, 31)
and preferably also the outer surfaces of the inner teeth

(3, 33, 37, 38, 39) comprising two edges (58, 10a) each, and
the outer and the inner support being rotatable relative to

each other in opposite directions; and
a working gap (6) being formed between respective outer and
inner teeth when they approach each other;

characterised in that
the inner surfaces (9a, 9b, 14, 21, 28a, 28b, 32) of the
outer teeth (8, 13, 22, 27, 31) and the outer surfaces (7,

23, 26, 36, 40) of the inner teeth (3, 24, 33, 37, 38, 39)
are so shaped and adjusted to each other that in the

maximally approached condition of a respective outer and
inner tooth, the associated working gap is substantially

narrowed in its centre.
Device according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the inner surfaces (21, 32) of the outer teeth (22, 31) or
the outer surfaces (7, 23, 40) of the inner teeth (3, 39) 

have a flat configuration and are disposed tangentially, and
in that
the associated outer surfaces (26, 36) of the inner teeth
(24, 33, 37, 38) resp. inner surfaces (9a, 9b, 14, 28a, 28b)

of the outer teeth (8, 13, 27) are provided with two flat or
two concave surfaces adjoining at an obtuse angle, or

cambered.
Device according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the inner support (1, 10, 49, 53, 54, 55, 57) comprises two
inner teeth (3) which are disposed opposite each other.
Device according to claim 3,

characterised in that

the inner support is in the form of a vertically extending
plate (10, 49, 53, 54, 55, 57), and in that the narrow sides

(23) of the plate form the two opposing inner teeth.
Device according to claim 4,

characterised in that

the plate (10, 49, 54, 55, 57) is essentially rectangular.
Device according to claim 4,

characterised in that

the plate (3. 51, 53) is essentially U-shaped and comprises
parallel flanks.
Device according to claim 4,

characterised in that

the cross-section of the plate (10, 49, 53, 54, 55, 57) is
recta
ngular, or tapered or rounded at the narrow sides.
Device according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the surfaces of the teeth are smooth, rough, ribbed, or
otherwise treated, and/or provided with recesses (52) or

with a point (50), or with combinations thereof.
