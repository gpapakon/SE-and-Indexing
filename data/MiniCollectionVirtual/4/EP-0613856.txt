<ABSTRACT>
Separate removal of S cpds. (I) and CO2 from gas comprises redn. of the S content to max. 3000, pref. max. 1500, esp. up to 1000 ppm catalytically and then to less than 10 mg/cu.m over doped activated charcoal (II); followed by removal of CO2 to a residual content less than 10(wt.)%, pref. between 0 and 5%, by pressure swing adsorption (PSA).

Process for the separate removal of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from gas, by 
conversion of higher concentrations of hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur in a first 

catalytic stage and conversion of lower concentrations of hydrogen sulfide into elemental 
sulfur in a second stage on activated charcoal activated with iodine, and subsequent 

removal of carbon dioxide by pressure swing adsorption, characterized in that gas to be 
purified is passed in a first stage through a catalyst zone, within which part of the 

hydrogen sulfide present, is catalytically oxidized to sulfur dioxide by addition of oxygen 
in such a quantity that a ratio of hydrogen sulfide to sulfur dioxide of approximately 2 : 1 

is obtained, whereby hydrogen sulfide preferably is in excess, that by catalytic 
conversion of the gases hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide the sulfur content is reduced 

down to 1000 ppm, that in a second stage gas of a sulfur content of â‰¤ 3000 ppm is 
reduced to a sulfur content of 
<
 10 mg/m
3
 on activated charcoal, doped with iodine and / or 
compounds of iodine. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that gas to be purified is synthesis gas. 
Process according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that as a iodine compound 
potassium iodide is used. 
Process according to claims 1 - 3, characterized in that the gas is treated with water 
before desulfurization.
