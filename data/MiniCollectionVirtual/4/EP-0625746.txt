<ABSTRACT>
Increasing the processing power by means of parallel preparation of, in each case, two instructions which do not need the operand preparation stage (RM) or the subsequent instruction unit (EX1) simultaneously for implementation, and by doubling the preparation stages (PF, AC) preceding the operand preparation stage (RM) by forming two parallel processing lines (A and B), which optionally feed the subsequent common stage (RM) with prepared instructions, so that sequences of jump instructions can be prepared at an early time via the respective other processing line, parallel to the linear sequence of instructions, until the jump decision has been made.
