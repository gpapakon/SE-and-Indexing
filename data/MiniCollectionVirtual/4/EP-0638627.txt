<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of coal liquefaction.Fig. 4 shows a schematic flowchart of conventional method of
coal liquefaction. According to the conventional method, a
pulverized coal and a coal liquefied oil (solvent) obtained from the
distillation step described later are charged into the slurry tank
2, where they are mixed together under agitation to prepare a coal
slurry. The coal slurry is pressurized and mixed with a gas
(recycle hydrogen gas) consisting mainly of hydrogen which was
separated in the gas purifying step described later, and they are
introduced to the heating furnace 3. The coal slurry entered into
the heating furnace 3 is brought into a state of 1.01 x 107 Pa (100 atm) or more and
400 °C or more, and fed to the coal liquefaction reactor 4. The
coal liquefaction reactor 4 conducts a liquefaction reaction under
a hydrogen positive pressure and at an elevated temperature.The product of the liquefaction reaction leaving from the
reactor 4 enters into the gas separator 6 where the product is 
separated to a gas and a liquefied slurry containing liquefied oil
and non-liquefied matter.The liquefied slurry contains lots of ash and non-liquefied
matter consisting mainly of un-reacted organic residue. Since
those non-liquefied matter induces troubles in the succeeding
treatment such as distillation, the liquefied slurry is sent to the
filter 30 to separate the non-liquefied matter. The liquefied
solution free of non-liquefied matter is sent to the distillation
unit 8 to fractionate into light oil and fuel oil, and to recover
the liquefied oil. A part of the liquefied oil is charged to the
slurry tank 2 as the solvent for preparing coal slurry. The filter
cake separated at the filter 30 is sent to the hydrogen
manufacturing facility 31 as the raw material for hydrogen
production, and is gasified there.On the other hand, the gas separated in the gas separator 6 is
sent to the gas purification unit 7 for purification. Since the gas
consists mainly of hydrogen, the gas is recycled and is added to
the coal slurry which is fed to the liquefaction reactor 4.
However, solely the hydrogen recycled is not sufficient to carry
the liquefaction reaction, the hydrogen obtained by gasification of
the filtrate discharged from the hydrogen manufacturing facility 31
is added to the coal slurry. The hydrogen manufacturing facility 31
consists of many treatment stages including the gasification stage
where the filtrate is completely decomposed under the presence of
oxygen, the purification stage
