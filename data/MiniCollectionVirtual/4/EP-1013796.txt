<ABSTRACT>
A thermal barrier coating (TBC) system, comprising a metallic bond
coat on an article surface (14) and an outer ceramic TBC is repaired by

renewing without removing the bond coat. The outer ceramic TBC is removed
to expose a bond coat substrate. At least one discrete local surface area (16,18)

of the article surface (14) subject to bond coat degradation is selected from a
thermal pattern unique to the article surface from service operation. At least one

renewal metal selected from Pt, Rh, and Pd is applied at least to the selected
discrete local surface area (16,18) and heated to diffuse the renewal metal into

the bond coat substrate. An environmental resistant coating selected from
aluminides and alloys including aluminum is applied at least to the discrete

local surface area (16,18) over the renewal metal. Thereafter, an outer ceramic
TBC is applied to the article surface (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to renewal of a protective coating on an article, and, more particularly, to renewing a thermal barrier coating (TBC) system by renewing a bond coat beneath the TBC.Certain components or articles operating in the gas path environment of a gas turbine engine are subjected to significant temperature extremes and degradation by oxidizing and corrosive conditions. It is common practice in the gas turbine engine art to apply a thermal barrier coating (TBC) system to surfaces of such components to protect them from such environment, while also affording the opportunity to improve the efficiency of the engine by enabling increase in operating temperatures.TBC systems generally are comprised of a metallic environmental inner coating, generally and herein called a bond coat, applied to an article surface, and an insulating ceramic outer layer, generally applied directly over the bond coat. Typical of such TBC outer coatings is one based on zirconia stabilized with yttria, for example about 92 wt. % zirconia stabilized with about 8 wt. % yttria. One preferred method for application or deposition of a TBC coating is by electron beam physical vapor deposition although plasma spray processes are widely used for turbine engine combustor applications. Apparatus is sold commercially for such uses. This general type of TBC system has been reported for some time as evidenced by such U.S. Patents as 4,055,705 - Stecura et al. (patented October 25, 1977); 4,095,003 - Weatherly et al. (patented June 13, 1978); 4,328,285 - Siemers et al. (patented May 4, 1982); 5,216,808 - Martus et al.(patented June 8, 1993) and 5,236,745 - Gupta et al. (patented August 17, 1993).Most frequently used bond coats for gas turbine engine turbine airfoils and combustor components have been classified into two general types. One is an overlay M Al type in which M is at least one element selected from Fe, Ni, and Co, for example MAI, MAlY, MCrAl, and MCrAlY; the other is diffused aluminide coatings. Both of these types have been widely used and reported in connection with the gas turbine art. MCrAlY type coating has been applied by physical vapor deposition, including sputtering, cathodic arc, and electron beam, as well as by plasma spray processes. Coating composition, microstructure and thickness are controlled by processing parameters. Diffused aluminide coatings have been applied by a variety of methods including, as used in the art, pack cementation, above the pack, vapor phase, chemical vapor deposition and slurry
