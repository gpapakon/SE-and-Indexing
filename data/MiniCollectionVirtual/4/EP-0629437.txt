<ABSTRACT>
A novel organic amine-impregnated activated carbon 
composition is disclosed which may be used in breathing gas 

filters to enhance removal of various toxic 
perfluorocarbons. Three processes for impregnating 

activated carbon with organic amines are also disclosed. 
One of these processes comprises the steps of placing the 

amine in contact with substantially dry activated carbon, 
subjecting the carbon and amine to an environment devoid of 

oxidizing gases or vapors (such as oxygen gas), and then 
heating the carbon and amine for an extended period while 

maintaining this oxidizer-free environment. Pretreatment 
procedures to enhance both the shelf-life and service-life 

of the amine-impregnated activated carbon are also 
disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a breathing gas filter
composition comprising activated carbon impregnated with
an organic amine compound to improve the performance of
the activated carbon against toxic perfluorocarbons,
particularly trifluoronitrosomethane (TFNM), and to
processes for impregnating activated carbon with organic
amine compounds.Activated carbon has been used in breathing gas filter
canisters of gas masks for the removal of toxic gases
both commercially and in military applications. For the
removal of specific poisonous gases such as hydrogen
cyanide (HCN) and cyanogen chloride (CNCl), activated
carbons are used which typically contain certain metals
(copper, chromium, and silver) usually in the form of an
oxide crystallite. Typically, these adsorbents are
known in the trade as ASC Whetlerite carbon or ASC/TEDA
if the carbon also contains triethylenediamine, TEDA.
The function of these metals or metal compounds is
primarily to break down HCN or CNCl by chemical
reaction(s) into innocuous gaseous products and/or
products which are readily physisorbed or chemisorbed
onto the activated carbon.Trifluoronitrosomethane (TFNM), is a perfluorocarbon
which is blue in colour and has a boiling point of -84°C.
Under sunlight (UV irradiation), this gas dimerizes, and
loses its intense blue hue to become faintly yellow.
TFNM is sufficiently toxic to be a high hazard, even to
subjects protected by standard carbon adsorbent filters.
The amine-impregnated activated carbon described herein
was found to be particularly effective in chemisorption
of this type of compound. From a methodology viewpoint, there are several ways to
apply an organic amine to the surface of activated
carbon. One proposal for applying TEDA to the surface
of activated carbon is found in US patent No. 4,531,953,
which was issued to J.E. Groose et al on July 30, 1985.
The Groose patent proposes the direct sublimation of TEDA
onto the activated carbon surface at atmospheric
pressure. Such a process eliminates the subsequent
drying procedure because no solvent is involved.
Another method for applying TEDA onto the surface of
activated carbon under reduced pressure has been detailed
in US patent No. 5,145,820, which was issued to S.H.
Liang et al on September 8, 1992.It is an aim of the invention to provide an organic amine
impregnated activated carbon, by which toxic
perfluorocarbons, particularly TFNM, can be effectively
removed from the breathing air stream, and having an
enhanced shelf and service life.In one aspect the invention resides in
