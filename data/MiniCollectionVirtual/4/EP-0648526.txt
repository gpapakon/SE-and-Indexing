<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mixing apparatus having a mixing vessel which comprises a stationary first mixing vessel part equipped with drivable mixing tools and a transportable second mixing vessel part, the two mixing vessel parts being able to be clamped together and the whole mixing vessel being able to be pivoted about a horizontal axis between a starting position and a mixing position. In order that the two mixing vessel parts can be clamped together relatively rapidly and reliably with relatively low expenditure in terms of construction, at least two clamping lugs are arranged fixed distributed about the periphery of the second mixing vessel part and the first mixing vessel part bears at least two combined lifting-clamping elements in its peripheral region which can be engaged with the clamping lugs in the sense of lifting the second mixing vessel part and clamping the two mixing vessel parts together.

<CLAIMS>
Mixing device comprising 

a) a mixing vessel (1) consisting of two mixing vessel 
parts (1a, 1b), of which the first mixing vessel part 

(1a) which is equipped with drivable mixing tools (5) is 
held stationary and the second mixing vessel part (1b) 

which is provided with a base outlet (6) is constructed 
so as to be transportable, 
b) a clamping device for reciprocal clamping of the two 
mixing vessel parts to form the mixing vessel (1), the 

second mixing vessel part (1b) being capable of being 
lifted relative to the first mixing vessel part (1a), 
c) a stationary frame (2) on which the first mixing vessel 
part (1a) is mounted so as to be pivotable about a 

horizontal axis of rotation (3) in such a way that the 
entire mixing vessel (1) can be pivoted by approximately 

180Â° between a starting position in which the first 
mixing vessel part (1a) forms the lid of the vessel and 

a mixing position in which the first mixing vessel part 
forms the base of the mixing vessel, 
 
characterised by the following features: 


d) at least two clamping projections (9) are fixed and 
distributed over the periphery of the second mixing 

vessel part (1b); 
e) the first mixing vessel part (1a) bears in its 
peripheral region at least two combined lifting and 

clamping devices (10) which correspond to the peripheral 
distribution of the clamping projections (9) on the 

second mixing vessel part and which can be brought into  
 

engagement with the clamping projections of the second 
mixing vessel part for the purpose of lifting the second 

mixing vessel part and clamping the two mixing vessel 
parts (1, 1b) against one another. 
Mixing device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the clamping projections (9) are fixed on the peripheral 

wall (1b'') of the second mixing vessel part (1b). 
Mixing device as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in 

that the clamping projections are constructed in the form of 
trunnions (9) and project outwards approximately horizontally 

from the peripheral wall (1b'') of the second mixing vessel 
part (1b), and in the starting position of the mixing vessel 

(1) they are provided above the centre of gravity of this 
second mixing vessel part but a sufficient distance below the 

upper end (1b') thereof. 
Mixing device as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in 
that in the arrangement of two trunnions (9) these latter are 

fixed, preferably welded, on the outer peripheral wall (1b'') 
of the second mixing vessel part (1b) so that they lie 

diametrically opposite one another. 
Mixing device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the lifting and clamping devices (10) have clamping hooks 

(11) which can be brought into engagement with the trunnions 
(9) of the second mixing vessel part (1b) as well as 

mechanical stroke adjustment means (12). 
Mixing device as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in 
that the mechanical stroke adjustment means are constructed in 

the form of threaded spindle drives (12). 
Mixing device as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in 
that the stroke adjustment means (12) are connected to a  

 
common drive motor (13). 
Mixing device as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in 
that each stroke adjustment means is associated with its own 

drive motor. 
Mixing device as claimed in Claim 1, wherein a guide 
arrangement is provided for positioning the transportable 

second mixing vessel part in the starting position below the 
first mixing vessel part, characterised in that - viewed in 

relation to the feed direction (8) of the second mixing vessel 
part (1b) - at least two guiding strips (15) which project 

downwards in the starting position of the mixing vessel (1) 
for positioning of the second mixing vessel part (1b) are 

firmly attached approximately in the rear peripheral region of 
the first mixing vessel part (1a), whilst at least one 

locating lock (16), which is capable of being fixed and in the 
starting position is movable downwards against the outer 

periphery of the second mixing vessel part (1b), is attached 
in the front peripheral region of the first mixing vessel 

part. 
Mixing device as claimed in Claim 9, characterised in 
that the locating lock (16) can be actuated manually or with 

the aid of its own drive.
