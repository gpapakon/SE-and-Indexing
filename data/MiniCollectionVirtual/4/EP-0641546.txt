<ABSTRACT>
A surgical staple (170,50,90) for securing a purse string 
suture (80) to human tissue comprises a staple body of 

deformable material formed into a loop through which the 
purse string suture is threaded. The staple body 

includes a pair of legs which are deformable into an 
overlapping configuration upon insertion into the tissue 

to secure the staple body and the purse string suture to 
the tissue. Alternatively, the staple body includes two 

or more legs including barbed ends for anchoring the 
legs to the tissue. To secure the purse string suture, 

a plurality of staples is positioned about the periphery 
of the tubular section of tissue, the purse string 

suture is threaded through the loops in the staples, and 
the staples are driven into the tissue to secure the 

purse string suture thereto. In addition, surgical 
instruments for open surgery and endoscopic surgery are 

provided for applying the staples and the purse string 
suture to the tissue. The instruments include a pair of 

staple cartridges each having a row of staple receiving 
slots intersected by an elongated central slot which 

allows the purse string suture to be attached to the 
staples in the cartridge prior to the operation of the 

instrument.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
surgical instrument and staples for applying purse 
string sutures to human tissue and, more particularly, 
to a surgical instrument and method in which a purse 
string suture is secured to human tissue by a plurality 
of staples. In addition, this invention relates to a 
surgical staple for securing a purse string suture to 
human tissue in which the staple body is adapted to be 
slidably attached to the purse string suture. In an alternative aspect, this invention 
relates to endoscopic instruments and methods and, more 
particularly, to an endoscopic surgical instrument and 
method for applying purse string sutures to body tissue 
by a plurality of staples. In the prior art, it is known to use a purse 
string suture to close a tubular section of tissue, 
e.g., intestinal tissue, prior to the performance of an 
end-to-end anastomosis with a circular suturing 
instrument. The purse string suture is attached to a 
surgical needle which is used by a surgeon to manually 
stitch the purse string suture about the periphery of 
the tubular section of tissue. After the purse string 
suture is stitched to the tissue, the ends of the purse  
 
string suture are pulled to tighten the stitches and 
draw the tissue together. Then, the purse string suture 
is wrapped and tightened about the tubular section of 
tissue. In the manual stitching of the purse string 
suture, it is difficult to obtain uniform penetration of 
the purse string suture into the tissue. It is also 
difficult to obtain stitches which are uniform in length 
and are evenly spaced apart. As a result, some of the 
stitches may rip away from the tissue when the ends of 
the purse string suture are pulled. Purse string suture devices are known in the 
prior art which comprise a pair of serrated tissue 
clamping jaws provided with teeth for clamping the 
tissue to be sutured therebetween. Such devices include 
needle passages which extend through the teeth on each 
jaw for receiving a needle attached to a suture to be 
threaded through the tissue. In use, the tissue to be 
sutured is clamped between the jaws and the needle is 
manually passed through the needle passages in both jaws 
to thread the suture through the tissue. Thereafter, 
the jaws are opened and the purse string suture is 
tightened and wrapped to draw the tissue together. 
Because the tissue may be gathered unevenly between the 
jaws, it is sometimes difficult to obtain uniform 
penetration of the needle and suture into the tissue. 
Thus,

<CLAIMS>
A surgical staple for securing a purse 
string suture to tissue, comprising: 

   a staple body comprising an elongated strip of 
deformable material including a pair of legs adapted to 

be inserted into the tissue, said legs being deformable 
upon insertion into the tissue to secure the staple body 

to the tissue; and 
   said staple body including means for slidably 

attaching the purse string suture to the staple. 
The staple of Claim 1, wherein: said 
receiving means comprises an eyelet formed on said 

staple body through which the suture is threaded. 
The staple of Claim 2, wherein: 
   said eyelet is located on the opposite side of 

said staple body from said legs. 
The staple of Claim 2, wherein: said 
eyelet is located on the same side of said staple body 

as said legs. 
The staple of Claim 1 wherein: 
   said legs are deformable into an overlapping 

configuration to secure said staple body to the tissue. 
A surgical stapler for endoscopic use comprising: 
   an endoscopic portion being insertable through a trocar 

cannula, said endoscopic portion including a pair of jaws, 
at least one of said jaws being movable between an open 

position and a closed position; 
   a handle portion connected to said endoscopic portion; 

   a staple cartridge in each jaw for holding a plurality 
of purse string staples and suture; 

   a closer mechanism in each cartridge for closing said 
staples; 

   a jaw actuator in said handle portion for moving said 
movable jaw between said open and closed positions; and
