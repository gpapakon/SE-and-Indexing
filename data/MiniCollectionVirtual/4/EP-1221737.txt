<ABSTRACT>
A compact antenna comprises a core which is a hard
linear member having a predetermined shape corresponding

to resonance characteristic, a conductor film which covers
at least a portion of an outer surface of the core and which

has higher electric conductivity than that of the core,
and a substrate which closely surrounds and holds the outer

surface of the core covered with the connection film. A
film thickness of the conductor film is equal to a skin

depth and thus, it is possible to inexpensively maintain
reliability, and to prevent radiation efficiency from being

lowered.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to producing method of a compact antenna according to claim 1.Figs. 26 show an outline structure of a conventional compact antenna used for a portable terminal. An antenna 301 shown in Fig. 26A has a meander-shaped radiating section 301a, and the radiating section 301 a is surrounded by a dielectric 301b. The radiating section 301a is continuously formed with a terminal 301c to be connected to a circuit board. Similarly, a compact antenna 302 shown in Fig. 26B has a helical-shaped radiating section 302a surrounded by a dielectric 302b. The radiating section 302a is continuously formed with a terminal 302c.To enhance the radiation efficiency of the antennas, it is necessary to enhance the electric conductivity of each of the radiating sections 301a and 302a as high as possible. That is, if the electric conductivity of each of the radiating sections 301a and 302a is low, a rate of electric power supplied to the radiating sections 301a and 302a which becomes thermal energy and is lost is increased. Therefore, it is preferable that the electric conductivity is as high as possible.FR 2 766 396 A teaches that electrical and elecronical elements can be mounted more appropriate by improving soldering characteriscs. The soldering characteristics are improved by coating a terminal or pad with a connection film.US 5,772,103 A discloses a composite structure consisting of a body with a surface and a cladding which is in intimate contact with the surface. The composite structure also includes a shape memory alloy. The structure can be used to form an antenna.The prior art reference US 5,825,334 A discloses an antenna structure and a method to manufacture this antenna. The antenna basically consists of a metal strip with slots stamped or punched into the strip.EP 1 085 597 A2 discloses an antenna package for use in a mobile communication device. A planar antenna is formed as a paddle with connecting leads, which are encapsulated by a dielectric material.It is an object of this invention to provide a producing method of a compact antenna capable of enhancing the radiation efficiency.It is another object of this invention to provide a producing method of a compact antenna capable of being mounted strongly to a circuit board, and to provide a producing method of the compact antenna.According to the invention, a producing method of a compact antenna according to claim 1 is provided.The connection film has a film thickness equal to or greater than a skin depth delta specified by the following
