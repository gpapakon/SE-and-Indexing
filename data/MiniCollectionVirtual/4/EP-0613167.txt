<ABSTRACT>
A display device such as a color phosphor display 
panel has a panel assembly comprising a faceplate, a pair of 

spaced side plates, and a backplate 1c which are joined together 
to provide an evacuated interior space. The display 

device includes a color filter layer comprising red, green, 
and blue filters disposed on the inner surface of the faceplate, 

the filter layer containing fine particles of inorganic 
metal compounds. A plurality of phosphor layers of ZnO 

: Zn are disposed on the color filter layer. A grid is disposed 
in spaced relation between the phosphor layers and a 

cathode for controlling a flow of thermions emitted from the 
cathode toward the phosphor layers. The fine particles of 

inorganic metal compounds have a particle size ranging from 
0.01 µm to 0.02 µm. Preferably, the red filter contains fine 

particles of Fe₂O₃, the green filter contains fine particles 
of TiO₂·ZnO·CoO·NiO, and the blue filter contains fine particles 

of CoO·Al₂O₃. The phosphor layers are made of ZnO : Zn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display device
for use as a color phosphor display panel, for example, in a
speedometer on an automobile, for example.There have heretofore been known color phosphor
display tubes comprising a combination of a bluish green
phosphor ZnO : Zn and color filters. The materials of the
color filters that are used have to be thermally stable because
a heat treatment process is usually carried out at
about 500°C when such a color phosphor display tube is manufactured.
The color filters for use in those color phosphor
display tubes are thus made of inorganic materials, rather
than organic materials that are used in liquid crystal display
panels, for example.It is preferable that the color filters have a high
transmittance so as not to reduce the intensity of light
emitted from the phosphor, and also have a low reflectance.The materials that have found wide use in the art
are metal colloids (see, for example, "Two-color Graphic
FLVFD with Internal Color Filters" by Yoshihisa Tsuruoka &
Yoshinari Okamoto, proceeding Japan Display, P1-2 (1992)).However, as shown in FIG. 1 of the accompanying
drawings, red and blue filters of the conventional materials 
transmit light having wavelengths other than those of red and
blue light. Therefore, the chromaticity points on a CIE
chromaticity diagram shown in FIG. 2 of the accompanying
drawings are represented by red: x/y = 0.347/0.281, bluish
green: x/y = 0.235/0.405, and blue: x/y = 0.260/0.297, resulting
in a narrow color reproducing range. Consequently,
no satisfactory colors can be produced by the conventional
color phosphor display tubes.In the US-A-4,392,077 an image display is disclosed which has a faceplate with a viewing
screen including a patterned layer of phosphor particles disposed contiguous on an inner
surface thereof. For minimizing loss of contrast caused by reflection of ambient light from
the layer there is provided a shallow, random, clumped, discontinuous, open dispersion of
contrast-enhancing particles of pigment having a body color corresponding generally to
said predetermined color located directly on the faceplate beneath the layer and not significantly
admixed with the phosphor particles. The particles of pigment are selected from a
group consisting of cadmium sulfoselenide, iron oxide, cobalt aluminate, cobalt silica zinc
and chromic oxide.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a phosphor display device which is capable of reproducing colors in
a wide color reproducing range
and which allows
