<ABSTRACT>
A microwave food heating package (10) for food pieces (44) such as french fried potatoes or fish sticks is described. The package (10) includes one or more susceptor sheets (42) folded in alternately opposite directions to provide accordion folds (41) therein which define V-shaped pockets that serve as heating chambers for individual pieces (44) of food. The susceptor sheet (42) is formed from a microwave energy-absorbing material adapted to heat, brown or crispen the surfaces of the food sticks (44). The heating chambers preferably enclose the food sticks (44) on all major surfaces and can be made by layering, i.e., stacking, segments of the accordion-pleated susceptor sheet material (42) one above another to form individual heating chambers for the food pieces (44) to crispen, toast or brown their surfaces during heating.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microwave food
heating package and more particularly to a food heating
package containing a folded microwave interactive
susceptor sheet that enhances the heating of food in a
microwave oven.A number of devices have been developed to enhance
the taste and aesthetic quality of food cooked in
microwave ovens either by ensuring uniform heat
circulation (Patent 4,121,510), by browning and searing
foods through creating and control of electrical fields
using conductive metals (Patent 3,946,187) or by
converting microwave energy, by way of resistive film,
to heat energy which is transferred to the food surface
by way of a corrugated metal sheet (Patent 4,398,077).
These devices are all cooking utensils. By contrast,
the invention is concerned with disposable packaging,
typically formed from paper and plastic film.Laminated sheets known as susceptors have been
previously proposed for heating foods with microwave
energy by absorbing a portion of the microwave energy
and transferring it by conduction to a food product. In
some cases sheet material of this kind from which the
susceptor is formed is stiff, brittle, subject to
breakage, and not adapted for use in lightweight
packaging products which should be disposable and low in
cost. In other cases the laminated susceptors, while
interacting with the microwave energy present in an
oven, do not adequately heat the food product. Still
other laminates can heat only one side of the food
product. So, for example, if the food product is
rectangular in shape, two or more sides remain unheated. The application of heat to at least two sides of
each piece of food, and more preferably to all sides, is
highly beneficial because it has been found that when a
food piece such as a french fried potato is placed in an
ordinary paperboard carton and heated in a microwave
oven, the potato pieces become soggy. This occurs even
if an effort is made to allow steam to vent from
openings at the top of the package. As a result,
attempts have been made to develop susceptors for lining
food cartons to augment the heat provided by direct
microwave interaction with the food. For example,
Patents 4,612,431 and 4,735,513 describe laminates
comprised of polyester to which thin, semiconductive
layers of metal have been applied. These laminates are
bonded to a wall of the package for absorbing microwave
energy and transferring the energy to the food product
as heat. Tests have shown, however, that these
laminates and the resulting packages are not effective
in

A microwave heating package (10) comprising a packaging enclosure

formed from a material that is at least partially transparent to microwave energy,

   
characterized in that
 the microwave heating package (10) further
comprises at least two susceptor segments (42) each comprising a laterally extending

susceptor material for absorbing microwave energy to heat, brown, and crisp food
pieces (44) within the package, each susceptor segment (44) being folded to have a

plurality of alternately oppositely directed parallel folds (41) to provide a zigzag
configuration defining adjacent panels (40) on either side of each fold (41), the folds

and adjacent panels (40) defining a plurality of V-shaped pockets (40a), and

   
in that
 the segments being stacked in co-operating relationship with the V-shaped
pockets of one segment co-operating with the V-shaped pockets of the other

segment to form food-containing chambers.
The microwave package of claim 1, further comprising at least three
susceptor segments (42) configured to define parallel rows of chambers,

wherein the chambers in a first row of chambers is staggered relative to the
chambers of a second row of chambers.
The microwave package of claim 1 or 2, wherein the susceptor
segments (42) comprise a continuous susceptor sheet.
The microwave package of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein susceptor
segments (42) are made of a laminate comprising two paper sheets (42a)

adhesively bonded to both sides of a base sheet of plastic film (42b) coated
with a microwave interactive material (42c).
The microwave package of claim 1 or 2, wherein the susceptor
segments (42) are physically connected and are different portions of a single 

susceptor sheet that is folded between adjacent segments and the folds are
boundaries of segments.
The microwave package of claim 1 or 2, wherein the susceptor
segments (42) are physically disconnected such that each segment is a

separate susceptor sheet.

segments (42) containing the food pieces (44) are arranged in a stack, the

stack is surrounded circumferentially by a paper band (71) that is joined at the
ends to form a fin seal (72) that provides a tab which can be used as a handle

to lift the food after heating.
The microwave package of claims 1 or 2, wherein the susceptor
segments (42) enclosing the food pieces (44) are contained in a paper pouch

(12) that is sealed at its ends.
The microwave package of claim 10, wherein the pouch (12) is made
