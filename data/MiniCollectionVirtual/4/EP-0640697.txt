<ABSTRACT>
Steel container 3, provided with an internal enamel layer, as a water reservoir which has a wall section 4, a bottom 7 and a lid 8, which likewise consist of sheet steel. The contact points of lid and bottom respectively with the central section are in the form of welded seams 18 whose inner sides in the region between two boundary lines 22 and 23 are wetted, prior to application of the enamel slip, with an aqueous solution or slurry of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphate or chloride, preferably sodium sulphate or chloride or magnesium sulphate or chloride, zinc sulphide, nickel oxide or cobalt oxide.

Internally enamelled storage vessel for a water reservoir, consisting 
of a roughly cylindrical jacket and a preformed bottom 

and a cover, connected with one another by welding seams, 

characterized in that
 prior to welding the welding seam areas are 
wetted with an alkali or alkaline earth metal sulphate or chloride, 

preferably sodium sulphate or chloride or magnesium sulphate 
or chloride. 
Internaliy enamelled storage vessel for a water reservoir, consisting 
of a roughly cylindrical jacket and a preformed bottom 

and a cover, connected with one another by welding seams, 

characterized in that
 prior to welding the welding seam areas are 
wetted with zinc sulphide, nickel oxide or cobalt oxide.  

 
Process for the manufacture of an internally enamelled storage 
vessel for a water reservoir, consisting of a roughly cylindrical 

jacket and a preformed bottom and a cover, which are initially 
degreased and, if necessary, grit-blasted with a metal grit, then 

welded together, coated with an enamel slip which is subsequently 

baked, 
characterized in that
 prior to welding the welding 
seam areas are wetted with an aqueous solution of an alkali or 

alkaline earth metal sulphate or chloride, preferably sodium 
sulphate or chloride or magnesium sulphate or chloride or an 

aqueous slurry of zinc sulphide, nickel oxide or cobalt oxide. 
Process as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the concentration 
of the said aqueous solution is between 50 and 300 

grams of magnesium sulphate per litre of water. 
Process as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the width of 
the wetted areas is between 1 and 4 cm on both sides of the 

welding seam, preferably between 2 and 3 cm. 
Process as claimed in any of Claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that
 
wetting is carried out on the interior of the storage vessel.
