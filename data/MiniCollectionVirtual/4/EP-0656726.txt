<ABSTRACT>
An address for a character generator ROM (121) is composed 
of an upper readout address portion which is a character 

code loaded from a text memory (110) for storing texts edited by 
a microcomputer and a lower readout address portion which 

is a value of a counter (122). Output data from the character 
generator ROM accessed by the above addresses are loaded in 

parallel by left-shift and right-shift registers (123;124). The 
output data is serialized by the left-shift register to form 

character pattern data, which in turn is superimposed on a 
video picture signal to be outputted to a VTR portion. In 

response to a self-image picture taking mode signal, one 
output is selected by a selector from the output of the 

left-shift register and the output of the right-shift 
register. The thus selected output is superimposed over the 

video picture signal to be delivered to a monitor screen 
driver circuit. The monitor screen driver circuit 

horizontally inverts the scanning direction in order to 
display a mirror-image of the picture on the monitor screen 

when the video camera is operated in the self-image picture 
taking state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a home video camera
equipped with a monitor screen and in particular to a
monitor screen-integrated video camera which has a joint
portion allowing a camera portion to rotate relative to a
monitor portion so that the camera lens can be oriented in
both the same and opposite directions with the face of the
monitor screen.Home video cameras are also called as a camera-integrated
video tape-recorder, and this type of products,
that is, including a VTR portion for allowing a video
cassette tape to record pictures as well as a camera for
taking pictures, have now been becoming popular in the
market.Now, a typical conventional monitor screen-integrated
video camera will be explained with reference to drawings.Fig.1 is an overall block diagram showing a prior art
example of a monitor screen-integrated video camera.In Fig.1, the conventional video camera has a camera
portion 1 for picking up a picture of objects, a monitor 
portion 2 for displaying the picture of the objects that
have been taken, and a joint portion 3 for jointing camera
portion 1 and monitor portion 2 and allowing relative
rotation of one to another.Camera portion 1 includes a camera lens 4 and a picture
pickup circuit 5 which converts optical images of objects
formed by camera lens 4 into video picture signals to be
outputted to monitor portion 2.Monitor portion 2 includes: a monitor screen 6 such as
of a liquid crystal panel or the like for displaying the
picture of objects taken; a display driver circuit 7 for
driving monitor screen 6; a VTR portion 8 for recording
video picture signals on an unillustrated video cassette
tape and reproducing video picture signals from a video
cassette tape; a superimposition controlling circuit 209 for
superimposing a date, operation information, caution notice
and the like over the video pictures to be displayed on
monitor screen 6 and/or to be recorded on the video cassette
tape; and a microcomputer 210 for controlling the entire
video camera.Joint portion 3 has a rotational angle detecting switch
11 that detects a relative rotational angle of camera
portion 1 to monitor portion 2. The rotational angle
detecting switch 11 outputs to microcomputer 210 a self-image
picture-taking mode signal that indicates that the 
camera is set in a position for picking up self-image when
both camera lens 4 and monitor screen 6 are oriented to the
same object.Microcomputer 210 may instruct display driver circuit
7 to display a horizontally inverted, mirror-image of the
pickup picture with

<CLAIMS>
A video camera with integral monitor, comprising
a camera portion (1) having a camera lens (4) for taking a picture and a monitor portion (2) having

a monitor screen (6) for displaying the picture taken by said camera portion (1), said camera and monitor portions
(1, 2) being rotatably interconnected so as to provide

selection between a normal picture-taking mode with
the camera lens (4) and monitor screen (6) facing in generally

opposite directions,
and a self-image

picture-taking mode in which the camera lens (4)
and monitor screen (6) face generally in the same direction

and in which a monitor screen drive circuit (7)
controls the image display by the monitor screen (6) so that

a mirror image of the picture taken by the video
camera is displayed, characterised in that said video camera includes means

(9) for superimposing character text on the displayed
image in accordance with character-defining signals,

and in that said superimposing means (9) is
operable in accordance with the mode selection to

process the character-defining signals so as to cause
the monitor screen (6) to display said character text

in legible form in each mode.
A video camera according to claim 1, including
means (11) for detecting the selection between a first

self-image picture-taking mode and a 
second self-image picture-taking mode, said first and second self-image picture-taking modes being
