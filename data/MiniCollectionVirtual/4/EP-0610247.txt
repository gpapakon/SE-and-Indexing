<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electromechanical drive system
for a device for carrying out intraocular surgical cutting
functions and to the device which is provided with two scissor
elements arranged parallel to one another in a guide tube
and in which one scissor element is linearly displaceable relative
to the other scissor element.Cutting instruments of many designs in the form of scissors,
forceps, knives or the like are generally known for use in
intraocular surgery, in which the drive can be carried out,
for example, manually or with pneumatic pressure means or
with an electric motor drive. The drive systems which can be
activated by the surgeon in different ways, for example by a
foot pedal, and cooperate with the respective cutting instrument
are also known. An instrument for cutting the front lens capsule is known,
for example, from US-A 4,911,161, which comprises a housing
designed as a hand grip, a headpiece arranged at one end of
the housing and a guide tube which is mounted therein and is
designed to receive a rod, wherein the rod cooperates at the
end arranged in the housing via a coupling element with a magnet
body capable of being driven in an axially oscillating
manner and is provided at the other end with a cutting head
which is bent at an obtuse angle to the longitudinal axis of
the rod and is provided with four conically tapering cutting
faces and cutting edges in the direction of a point starting
from the curved portion. An axially orientated movement of
two scissor elements capable of moving relative to one
another and designed as cutting blades at the front end is
not proposed in this device.Vibratory scissors which are designed for use in cataract
surgery are also known from US-A 3,899,829 or the documentary
publication, "Vibration als neuartiges Schneideprinzip für
die Augenchirurgie" (Klin. Mbl. Augenheilkunde 166 of 1975;
pages 557 to 558, M.Spitznas; A.Kreiger), which comprise a
housing designed as a hand grip, a drive system arranged
therein and two scissor blades which are mutually spaced on
the face from the housing, are angled in design cooperate
with one another in the front region via a pin and are angled
downwards with respect to the longitudinal axis of the housing
at a concave angle, one lower scissor blade being stationary
and the other, superimposed scissor blade being displaced
with an a.c. current frequency of about 50 Hz relative
to the stationary scissor blade and being pivoted round the
axis of the pin. The angled scissor blades of these vibratory
scissors
