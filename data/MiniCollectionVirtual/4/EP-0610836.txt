<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ultrasonic motor which comprises a vibrator comprising
an elastic body and a piezoelectric body adhered thereto, said piezoelectric body
being electrically polarized in a direction of the thickness thereof to have a predetermined
polarization pattern in a circumferencial direction thereof, a moving body
press-contacted against said vibrator by a biasing means via a friction element, a
plurality of drive electrodes arranged on one principal plane of said piezoelectric
body, a drive circuit applying drive signals to said plurality of drive electrodes to
generate two standing waves having an identical angular frequency and a phase
difference equivalent to π/2 or 3π/2, said two standing waves inducing an elastic
travelling wave in said vibrator which causes rotation of said moving body, and
first and second vibration detection electrodes arranged at respective positions on
said one principal plane of said piezoelectric body for detecting vibrations at said
respective positions of said vibrator.Moreover, the present invention relates to control methods for controlling an
ultrasonic motor in which a moving body press-contacted to a vibrator is moved by
an elastic travelling wave excited in said vibrator by generating two standing
waves having phases which are different from each other by driving a piezoelectric
body adhered to said vibrator by AC voltages.Such an ultrasonic motor as well as a control method therefor are known from US-A-5,001,404. Ultrasonic motors that are driven by exciting
elastic vibration in a vibrating body comprised of a
piezoelectric ceramic or other piezoelectric body have
become widely known in recent years. The operation of such
an ultrasonic motor is described below with reference to
Figs. 28, 29 and 30.Fig. 28 is a partially cut-away view of the basic
configuration of a disk-shaped ultrasonic motor wherein a
piezoelectric body 2 is affixed to one primary side of a
elastic base 1 to form a vibrator 3. A plurality of projections 1a
are provided on the other primary side of the elastic base
1. A moving body 4 is made by laminating a elastic body
and a wear-resistant friction member together. The moving
body 4 is press-contacted against the vibrator 3. An
electric field is applied to the piezoelectric body 2 to 
induce two standing waves at a 90° phase difference around
the circumference of the vibrator 3, thereby exciting
travelling waves of a bending vibration and driving the
moving body 4 by means of friction.Figs. 29 and 30 show the electrode
