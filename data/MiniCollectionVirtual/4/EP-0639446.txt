<ABSTRACT>
An injection-moulded article composed of a thermoplastic material which contains glass fibres of a fibre length of at least 5 mm, in a quantity of 2 to 8% by weight, referred to the total weight of glass fibres plus thermoplastic material, the injection-moulded article having an impact resistance at +23 DEG C of at least 170 kJ/m
<
2
>
 and an impact resistance at -30 DEG C of at least 140 kJ/m
<
2
>
. The novel injection-moulded article is distinguished by a distinct improvement in its impact resistance together with significantly increased heat resistance in comparison with injection-moulded articles of plain, non-fibre-reinforced polyethylenes.
