<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to a heat and vapour generator with a 
structure based on a tubular horizontal unit (1) that defines a seal 

chamber 
filled with water to be heated, inside which there is a combustion chamber 

(5) off-centred sidewards and a series of conduits (6,7,8) arranged 
longitudinally 

along the tubular unit (1), grouped in different chambers defined in the 
front 

and back door (9,10) by partitions, presenting different arrangements 
depending 

on the form of these partitions (11) that determine the direction and 
sense of the 

run of the fumes. In the case of a closed combustion chamber and with a 
different arrangement of the conduits it will operate as a vapour generator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a heat and vapour generator that can 
be used as heating boiler, hot water or vapour generator, with structural 
characteristics that provide, together with the advantages from the 
functional point of view, a very simple structure and a considerable 
prolongation of the life span, almost without any maintenance. In the field of heat generators of this kind, one of the most advanced 
solutions is a structure based on a tubular unit, cylindrical, horizontal, 
opened at the ends, where there are two doors, and with interior cross 
partitions that define with the two doors two chambers corresponding to the 
fumes circulation circuit, and a chamber between the two partitions, 
bigger in size, filled with water to be heated. In the lower part of this water chamber there is a furnace, isolated 
from the two fumes chambers mentioned above, connected through an 
axial prolongation neck directly to one of the end doors where there is a 
burner just in front of the furnace, while at the other end it is connected to 
another chamber independent from the fumes chamber through an 
interior door, eccentric with respect to the furnace and located slightly 
upwards; in this sector there is a first bank of tubes that communicate this 
chamber with the fumes chamber at the other end of the tubular unit of the 
generator, at the same time that between this fumes chamber situated in 
the door where the burner is placed and the other external fumes chamber 
with the interior door there is another bank of tubes that communicates 
both chambers and completes the passage of the fumes that from this last 
external chamber go outside, the two banks of tubes immersed in the water 
that fills the intermediate chamber. There are two other solutions for heat generators of this kind, less 
advanced, but all have in common the maze of the banks of tubes for the  
 
passage of fumes, as mentioned above. The main problem of this kind of generators is the presence of 
these banks of tubes, that can be more than a hundred, and particularly in 
two aspects: on one hand, the high costs for the installation of such a great 
number of tubes, and on the other hand the effects of the corrosion 
produced in them that shortens considerably the life span of the generator 
as a consequence of the sweating produced in these tubes, to such extent 
that in heating boilers and other cases in which the operation of the 
generator is interrupted, the life span can be reduced to six or seven years, 
making it necessary to

Thermic generator with a structure based on a tubular horizontal 
unit that defines a seal chamber filled with water to be heated, with a 

furnace or combustion chamber with the corresponding burner, provided 
with a series of conduits for the combustion fumes connected to an 

evacuation chimney, characterised because the furnace or combustion 
chamber (5) adopts an off-centred position both sidewards and downwards 

inside the tubular unit (1), presenting the bottom opened or closed. 
Thermic generator according to previous claim characterised 
because in the combustion chamber with the bottom closed the combustion 

fumes collide with the bottom and return to the front opening, with the 
particularity that between the two plates, front plate (2) and back plate (2') 

joined hermetically to the openings of the tubular unit (1), there are 
conduits of big diameter (6,7,8) that together with the furnace (5) determine 

a run for the fumes with four longitudinal stretches along the tubular unit 
(1) of the generator before reaching the final outlet (15). 
Thermic generator according to previous claims characterised 
because one of the plates (2) that close the openings of the tubular unit (1) is 

provided with a window (4) for access to the furnace (5) for the burner, the 
other plate (2') serving as closing device for the back end of the furnace (5), 

while in both plates (2, 2') there are groups of conduits (6,7,8). 
Thermic generator, according to previous claims, characterised 
because the doors (9, 10) that close the ends of the tubular unit (1) and 

provide a seal over both plates (2,2'), with a dished shape, present in the 
front door (9) a hole (12) for the installation of the burner and a seal 

partition (11) that separates the furnace (5) and the pair of conduits (6) 
place just above it from the other two groups of conduits (7,8), while the 

back door (10) is provided with another seal partition (14) that separates the 
conduits (6) situated just above the furnace (5) and the side-lower conduits 

(8) from the conduits (7) situated just above them, connecting them with the 
fumes outlet (15), so that the fumes that return from the bottom of the 

furnace (5) pass through the back door (9) to the upper conduits (6), 
running along the tubular unit and into the lower conduits (8), then 

running again to the front door (9) and finally through the last stretch they 
 

reach the definitive fumes outlet (15). 
Thermic generator characterised because the furnace or 
combustion chamber has the bottom opened, so that the burned fumes run 

longitudinally through the conduits (16, 17, 18) inside different chambers 
defined by the partitions of both doors (19,20), determining a five stretch run 

across the tubular unit of the generator. 
Thermic generator according to previous claim characterised 
because the front door (19) presents a vertical partition that divides it into 

two chambers, so that the opening of the combustion chamber (5), the 
upper conduits (16) and one of the columns (17a) of the group of central 

conduits are in chamber (19b), the side conduits (17) and the other column 
of central conduits (17b) are in chamber (19a), and the back door (20) is 

provided with a series of partitions that define two chambers (20a, 20b), the 
chamber (20a) comprising the upper conduits (16) and the combustion 

chamber (5), and chamber (20b) the central conduits (17), these two 
chambers (20a, 20b) independent from the group of side conduits (18), so 

that the fumes coming from the back part of the combustion chamber reach 
chamber (20a) and run through the upper conduits (16) into chamber (19b), 

then through the central conduits (17a) to the chamber (20b) or the back 
door (20), and then through the central conduits (17b) 
to the front chamber 
(19a), passing finally through the side conduits (18) and reaching the 

fumes outlet. 
Thermic generator according to previous claims characterised 
because each step or longitudinal run of the gases inside the tubular unit 

(1) can be defined by a single conduit, a pair or more conduits, in any case a 
small number, and these conduits can have any section or arrangement, 

as well as the tubular unit.
