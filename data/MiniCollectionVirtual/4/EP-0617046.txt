<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel nucleoside 
derivatives, a process for the preparation of the same, and 
an anti-herpes composition containing the same. Recently, studies for providing medicaments for treating 
various virus diseases have been earnestly made. Particularly, 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) constitutes 
a serious social problem. It is known that AIDS 
is caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus 
which is one of retroviruses. At present, 3'-deoxy-3'-azidothymidine 
(AZT) is approved as a medicament for 
treating the HIV infectious disease. However, this medicament 
has a problem that it shows high toxicity to host 
cells so as to cause troublesome side effect. Therefore, 
development of compounds showing high anti-retrovirus 
activity but low toxicity to host cells has been desired. Also desired is a compound showing high anti-herpes 
virus activity, particularly anti-varicella-zoster virus 
activity. As an anti-herpes virus medicament, Acyclovir 
which is a guanosine derivative is known. Acyclovir shows 
inhibitory effect to herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and 
type 2 at a low concentration of less than 0.05 µL/mL, 
while it shows inhibitory effect to varicella-zoster virus 
(VZV) at an extremely high concentration such as 400 to 600 
times as much as that for HSV. Moreover, it is reported 
that Acyclovir is not effective to cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
having no thymidine kinase (TK) in "Clinic and Study, vol. 
70, No.8 (1993, August), page 21". Varicella-zoster virus 
strain is classified into two types, that is, thymidine  
 
kinase-positive (TK⁺) strain and thymidine kinase-deficient 
(TK⁻) strain. Accordingly, an anti-herpes agent having 
activity to varicella-zoster virus strains of both types, 
particularly the thymidine kinase-deficinet varicella-zoster 
virus is desired. An object of the present invention is to provide a new 
nucleoside derivative having high antiviral activities such 
as high anti-herpes virus activity and high anti-retrovirus 
activity. Specifically, the invention has an object to provide a 
new nucleoside derivative having high antiviral activities 
to human immunodeficiency virus and varicella-zoster virus. The present invention resides in a nucleoside derivative 
having the formula (1-1) or (1-2): 
   wherein A is a nitrogen atom-containing heterocyclic 
ring which is linked through nitrogen atom thereof; B is a 
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an azido group, an alkyl  
 
group having 1-7 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group having 5-19
