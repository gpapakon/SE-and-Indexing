<ABSTRACT>
An articulable assembly is provided for an 
endoscopic instrument along with a surgical fastener 

track therefor. The assembly includes a distal end 
portion for supporting an end effector to effect tissue 

manipulation while carrying out a surgical procedure 
within a body cavity. The assembly includes an 

articulable joint connecting an elongate support housing 

with the distal end portion. The joint includes a 
hollow socket and a convex member that is received in 

the socket. The convex member defines a passageway for 
accommodating an actuator extending from the housing 

through the joint to actuate the end effector. An 
operator is provided on the housing and extends to the 

socket or convex member for moving the distal end 
portion into and out of alignment with the housing. A 

flexible track is provided for guiding fasteners through 
the joint.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to surgical 
instruments used in endoscopic procedures. Endoscopic surgical techniques have become 
widely accepted. As used herein, the term "endoscopic" 
pertains generally to the use of a surgical instrument 
which is inserted into a body cavity in conjunction with 
an endoscope which is inserted into the same body 
cavity. The endoscope permits visual inspection, with 
or without magnification, of the interior of the body 
cavity and permits observation of the operation of the 
surgical instrument for therapeutic or diagnostic 
purposes. In a typical endoscopic surgical procedure, 
the abdominal cavity of a human or animal subject is 
insufflated with a sterile gas, such as carbon dioxide, 
in order to provide increased maneuvering room within 
the body cavity for endoscopic instruments. Then, 
conventional trocars are inserted into the subject's 
body cavity through the surrounding skin, tissue, and 
musculature. A conventional trocar typically consists 
of a trocar cannula which houses an elongated trocar 
obturator. Trocar obturators typically have a piercing 
point, although other types of obturators are also 
available. After each trocar has been positioned within 
the body cavity adjacent the target surgical site, the 
trocar obturator is removed leaving the trocar cannula 
as a pathway to the body cavity. A plurality of trocar 
cannulas are typically placed in this manner. The  
 
surgeon can then insert an endoscope through one of the 
trocar cannulas and can insert various types of 
endoscopic, surgical instruments through one or more of 
the other trocar cannulas at the target surgical site 
where the diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedure 
is performed. The endoscope is typically connected to a 
video camera, and the output from the video camera is 
fed to a video monitor which displays the surgical site 
and the end of the endoscopic instrument at the surgical 
site. Examples of endoscopic instruments include 
ligating clip appliers, tissue cutters, electrosurgical 
instruments, tissue graspers, needle graspers, cannulas, 
tissue manipulators, and the like. Although endoscopic surgical procedures offer 
many advantages, there are some problems associated with 
these procedures as conventionally practiced. For 
example, because the surgeon typically views the display 
on the video monitor as he manipulates instruments 
within the body cavity, the video display provides the 
surgeon with only a two-dimensional view of the surgical 
site, and there is
