<ABSTRACT>
Word lines (WL1 to WL4) are divided into a plurality 
of blocks (BLK1 to BLK4) in a row direction, and 

divided into a plurality of sections (SEC1 to SEC4) 
having e.g., four word lines in a column direction. An 

area where each block and each section are crossed is 
used as a sector (SCT). One sector (SCT) includes four 

word lines (WL1 to WL4). A control gate of a plurality 
of transistors constituting a memory cell (MC) is connected 

to each of the word lines (WL1 to WL4), each 
drain is connected to each of the bit lines (CL1 to 

CL4), and each source is connected to each of source 
lines (SL1, SL2) in common. A source main decoder (SMD) 

is provided in each section, source sub-decoders (SSD1 
to SSDn) are provided in each sector (SCT). Each source 

sub-decoder includes each of supply circuits (SC1 to 
SCn). The source main decoder (SMD) outputs a sector 

selection signal (SI) in accordance with a row address 
signal, and a block decoder (BDC) outputs block selection 

signals (B0, /B0 to Bn,/Bn) in accordance with a 
column address signal. One supply circuit is selected 

by the sector selection signal (SI) and the block selection 
signals (B0, /B0 to Bn,/Bn), and the selected 

supply circuit supplies the sector selection signal (SI) 
outputted from the source main decoder (SMD) source 

lines (SL1 to SLn) as an erase signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonvolatile
semiconductor memory device and, more particularly to
a flash memory which can select a source terminal and
flash-erase memory data.The flash memory is a nonvolatile semiconductor
memory, which can electrically write and erase data, and
comprises an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable
Read Only Memory). Particularly, the flash memory can
flash-erase date by a predetermined unit. In the conventional
flash memory, data stored in all memory cells
of the chip was flash-erased (chip erase). However, in
accordance with the large capacities of the memory, it
has been required that data be rewritten by a small
unit. Due to this, in recent years, the chip is divided
into several blocks, and data can be block-erased by
each block unit.Also, in accordance with the advance in the large
capacities of the flash memory, an electrical disk has
been replaced by the flash memory. Then, it has been
desired that the data writing unit be arranged to be a
sector size of the electrical disk. Due to this, it is
needed that data erasing be performed by the unit of
512B (B: Byte), which is called as a sector erase.
There is a tendency that the erase unit of the flash
memory is made smaller in order of the chip erase, block
erase, and sector erase. Particularly, in the flash 
memory of the large capacity, data erase by the sector
unit is important.The following will explain the cell data writing
and erasing in the flash memory. The data writing and
erasing is that a threshold voltage of a cell transistor
is changed.FIG. 9 shows a flash memory cell, which is mainly
used at present. The memory cell has the same structure
as an EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory :
PROM of ultraviolet ray erasing type) having a double
gate structure. In this type of the memory cell, the
data writing is exactly the same as EPROM. In other
words, a source terminal S is grounded, and high voltage
for writing is applied to a control gate CG and a drain
D. Then, a hot electron generated close to the drain D
is implanted to a floating gate, and the threshold
voltage of the cell transistor is increased.The following will explain two typical methods for
erasing data. The first method is a source erase method
(hereinafter called as SE). According to this method,
as shown in FIG. 10A, the control gate CG is grounded,
the drain D is opened, and high voltage VE for erasing
(>0) is applied to the source S. Then, a high electrical
field is applied between the source and floating
gate FG, and a tunnel
