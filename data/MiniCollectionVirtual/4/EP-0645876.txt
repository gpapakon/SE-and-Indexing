<ABSTRACT>
A linear pulse motor includes a stator core 
manufactured easily and windings for phases disposed in the 

circumferential direction of the stator core and the length 
thereof is not lengthened in the shaft direction even when a 

multi-phase linear pulse motor is configured. The linear 
pulse motor includes a stator 1 having teeth 17 formed on an 

inner peripheral surface thereof in the shaft direction and a 
plurality of salient poles 11, 12, 13, ... disposed at an 

equal pitch angle and a mover disposed movably in the shaft 
direction. A stator core 10 is formed by laminating stator 

iron plates 30 with the stator iron plates being rotated 
sequentially by a predetermined angle. When k is an integer 

larger than or equal to 1 and m is the number of phase, the 
stator iron plate includes k·m salient poles P1, P2, P3, ... 

. One salient pole having a smaller inner radius at the tip 
thereof and (m-1) salient poles having a larger inner radius 

at the tip thereof opposite to the mover as viewed from the 
mover are disposed side by side in order of the description 

to form one set of salient poles and the stator core is 
constituted to have k sets of salient poles. The 

predetermined angle for the lamination and rotation is 
(360/k·m) degrees.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a VR (variable 
reluctance) type linear pulse motor. As a conventional linear pulse motor of this type, a VR 
type cylindrical linear pulse motor is disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 5-19282 (No. 19282/1993) (entitled 
"Linear Actuator"). The linear pulse motor according to the 
patent publication includes a stator to which windings are 
wound and an armature supported to the stator movably in the 
shaft direction thereof. The stator includes segments (iron 
plates) having a plurality of magnetic poles and spacers 
which are laminated alternately, and the magnetic poles are 
magnetized by a current supplied to the windings to have N 
and S poles alternately. The armature is a ring mounted on a 
rod-like non-magnetic support tube and is driven in the shaft 
direction by a magnetic flux produced by the current 
selectively flowing through the windings and passing through 
the stator and the armature. Further, U. S. Patent No. 5,093,596 (entitled "Combined 
Linear-Rotary Direct Drive Step Motor) discloses a three-phase 
VR type cylindrical linear pulse motor. The linear 
pulse motor according to the U. S. Patent includes a variable  
 
reluctance type linear stepping motor portion and a hybrid 
permanent magnet type rotary stepping motor portion having a 
common output shaft and accommodated in one housing. However, the former linear pulse motor of them includes 
a stator disposed in the shaft direction thereof for 
constituting the phases, and there is a problem that the 
motor is lengthened in the shaft direction when a multi-phase 
motor is configured. On the other hand, the latter linear pulse motor 
includes a stator composed of stator iron plates and spacer 
iron plates laminated alternately, and there is a problem 
that two kinds of iron plates must be laminated alternately 
to manufacture a stator core and the tips of salient poles of 
the stator iron plates must be bent alternately, so that the 
stator core cannot be manufactured easily. EP-A-0319096 discloses (embodiment of figures 3a-3f, 4) a 
linear pulse motor including a stator provided with a stator 
core having a plurality of salient poles disposed at an equal 
pitch angle radially inward and a plurality of stator teeth 
formed on inner peripheral surfaces of said salient poles in a 
shaft direction and a mover provided with a mover core 
disposed within said stator to be supported movably in the 
shaft direction and having a plurality of mover teeth disposed 
opposite to said stator teeth on an
