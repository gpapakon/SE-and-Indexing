<DESCRIPTION>
 - / -APPARATUS FOR RECEIVING AND MODIFYING A SERIAL DATA PACKET FROM A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK TO INDICATE ITS STATUSDESCRIPTIONTechnical Field Applicants' invention relates generally to electrical control mechanisms and more particularly to a network of single point input and output devices serially connected to programmable logic controllers or other types of microprocessor based devices that performs a number of control functions.Related ApplicationsThis application is related to the following, commonly assigned applications filed concurrently herewith, entitled " A Synchronous Serial Communication Network For Controlling Single Point I/O Devices" (Serial No. xxx,xxx. Our Docket AP-46) ; "Apparatus For Generating And Sending A Serial Data Packet for Controlling A Network Of Single Point I/O Devices" (Serial No. xxx,xxx. Our Docket AP-47) ; and "Apparatus For Receiving And Decoding A Serial DataPacket Containing The Status Of A Network of Single Point I/O Devices" (Serial No. xxx,xxx, Our Docket AP - 48) . The contents of these applications are expressly incorporated herein by reference.Background ArtInput and output control modules for interfacing with a programmable logic controller (PLC) that is normally used to control a number of functions in a manufacturing operation are well known. In most instances, these control module assemblies are electrically interconnected in a rack assembly with the PLC. This assembly is often of necessity located on the plant floor at a distance from the machinery used in the manufacturing operation to prevent physical 

 abuse from dirt, moisture, or vibration. Since many of the switches, pilot lights, control relays and so on are located on the machinery, considerable wiring is required to connect these devices to the PLC since each device requires at least two wires between it and its respective I/O point.Remote I/O control modules are available that can b located in a rack assembly mounted directly on the machinery. Whereas this will reduce the wiring requirements, the additional rack assembly will require adding a power supply and a remote network interface module (NIM) that could be more costly. These assemblies are generally bulky and require mounting space that may not be available. Each device will still require a direct connection to the remote I/O control module.The host PLC will also require a local NIM Communications between the local and remote NIMs can become complicated. Each device has an unique address. There must be a means for each I/O point to know

 CLAIMS
We claim:
1. A remote input/output repeater (IOR) module 5 for transferring data between a host microprocessor based device and a plurality of other IOR modules connected on a synchronous serial communications network, said IOR comprising: 10 (A) a serial input for receiving a data packet from said network; (B) a clock input for synchronizing the IOR with said host microprocessor based device connected on said network; 15 (C) an input means for connecting an input device;
(D) an output means for connecting an output device;
(E) detecting means connected to said serial 20 input for decoding said data packet for an output byte and extracting means for removing said output byte from said data stream, wherein said extracted output byte is coupled to said output means to 25 control said output device;
(F) modifying means connected to said detecting means for inserting an input byte into said modified data packet, said input byte received from said input means
30 and representing a status of said input device;
(G) sending means coupled between said modifying means and a serial output for sending said modified data packet to a
35 next device connected in series on said network; and 


 (H) wherein said IOR requires no unique hardware address detection means to determine its position on said network.
5 2. The remote input/output repeater (IOR) module of claim 1 wherein said first IOR module connected in series on said network receives said data packet from a transmitter module in said host microprocessor based device 10 connected in series on said network.
3. The remote input/output repeater (IOR) module of claim 1 wherein said last IOR module connected in series on said network sends said
15 modified data packet to a receiver module in said host microprocessor based device connected in series on said network.
4. The first IOR module connected in series on 20 said network of claim 2 wherein said received data packet from said transmitter module consists of an input sync byte, an output sync byte, and n number of output bytes, where n is the number of said IOR modules connected on 25 said network.
5. The data packet received by the receiver of claim 3 wherein said modified data packet consists of an input sync byte, n number of 30 input bytes, where n is the number of said IOR modules connected on said network, and an output sync byte. 


 6. The remote input/output repeater (IOR) module of claim 1 wherein said IOR module inserts its said input byte immediately after said input sync byte and extracts said output byte
5 immediately after said output sync byte.
7. The data packet claim 1 wherein said output bytes are split-phase binary encoded.
10 8. The modified data packet of claim 1 wherein said input bytes are split-phase binary encoded.
9. The synchronous serial communications network 15 of claim 1 wherein said host microprocessor based device is a programmable logic controller.
10. The synchronous serial communications network 20 of claim 1 wherein said host microprocessor based device is a personal computer.
11. The synchronous serial communications network of claim 1 wherein said synchronous serial
25 communications network is a multiconductor wire cable and said data packet is transmitted over said cable.
12. The synchronous serial communications network 30 of claim 1 wherein said synchronous serial communications network includes a fiber optic cable and said data packet is transmitted over said fiber optic cable.
