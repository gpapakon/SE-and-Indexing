<ABSTRACT>
A system including a graphical user interface provides a list box of 
items relating to data entered on pages of a displayed notebook. By 

selecting the desired item, the displayed notebook immediately flips to 
the page having the desired data entry. Further, the items listed in the 

box may be representative of a specific parameter included in the desired 
notebook entry. When the desired item is selected and the page is 

flipped to the corresponding page, the cursor will be located at the 
parameter represented in the list box. A relational facility is used to 

correlate the items in the list box with the notebook page on which the 
item can be found. The list box may be displayed to a system user as the 

left hand page of a spiral notebook, with data entries on the right hand 
page. A list item entry is related to a page id, field id, or other data 

to determine an address for the page on which the selected item is found. 
Upon selection of a list item, this facility provides the address for the 

corresponding page and the system then displays the page with the desired 
data entry. In this manner, a user can select the exact parameter 

desired, without being required to scroll through a series of displayed 
pages to find the parameter, as in conventional systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to user interfaces in computer systems. Currently, the IBM OS/2 operating system, version 2.0 utilizes 
displayed notebook pages as one means for representing data to a system 
user. These notebook pages are designed to make data presentation and 
retrieval clear and easy when using the system, since data can be 
retrieved and manipulated using objects that users are familiar with. 
For more information regarding the IBM OS/2 operating system, the reader 
is referred to "OS/2 2.0 Technical Library Programming Guide, Vol. 1, 2, 
3, Version 2.00, Order Nos. 10G6261, 10G6495, 10G6494. The IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, volume 35, number 2, July 
1992, page 225 shows an unopened spiral notebook having a spin button 
which a user utilizes to turn the pages. A number of scrollable tabs are 
also shown which may be used to select various pages in the notebook. Additionally, IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, volume 35, number 
4B, September 1992, pages 284-285, is another representation of a 
notebook wherein a plurality of notebook pages are shown each with an 
alphabetically ordered tab. One of the shortcomings of this invention is 
the inability to show all of the 26 letters of the alphabet 
simultaneously. To solve this problem, cascaded tabs are used wherein 
each tab has multiple letters associated with it. For example, U-W is 
included on a single tab and an arrow is also included on the tab such 
that the user can scroll between the letters on the tab and select the 
one of interest. However, all of the conventional notebook representations require a 
user to tab or scroll through the alphabet to find a specific data entry. This invention is directed to the technical problem of providing a 
user interface of this general type wherein a user can directly access 
data on a notebook page in a convenient manner without having to tab or 
scroll through the alphabet to find a specific data entry.  To solve this problem, the invention provides a computer system 
arranged to display an object having a plurality of first displayable 
portions each including at least one selectable parameter associated 
therewith, characterised by: means for displaying a second portion of 
said object including a list of items each corresponding to one of said 
first portions and one of said parameters; means responsive to a 
predefined user input operation to select one of said items; and means 
for displaying, in response to said selection of one of said items, an 
associated one of said first
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A computer system arranged to display an object having a plurality of 
first displayable portions each including at least one selectable 

parameter associated therewith, characterised by: 
   means for displaying a second portion of said object including a list 

of items each corresponding to one of said first portions and one of said 
parameters; 

   means responsive to a predefined user input operation to select one 
of said items; and 

   means for displaying, in response to said selection of one of said 

items, an associated one of said first displayable portions of said 
object with a particular one of said at least one parameters selected. 
A system as claimed in Claim 1 further comprising means for 
associating said selected item with one of said first portions and one of 

said parameters. 
A system as claimed in claim 2 wherein said means for associating 
further comprises: 

   means for storing said items in a list; 
   means for storing first portion and parameter data in a second list; 

and 
   means for relating the items with corresponding first portion and 

parameter data by their respective positions in the first and second 
lists. 
A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said first 
portion is a graphical notebook page and said parameter is at least one 

control field on said notebook page. 
A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said means for 
displaying the associated first portions comprises:

 
   means for displaying a specific one of said graphical notebook pages 

when a related one of said items is selected; and 
   means for locating a cursor at a position on a display screen 

corresponding to said at least one control field on said displayed 
specific one of said notebook pages. 
A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said first 
portion data includes page identification data and said parameter data 

includes control field identification data. 
A method for operating a computer system to enable a user to navigate 
through an object having a plurality of first displayable portions each 

including at least one selectable parameter associated therewith, said 
method characterised by the steps of: 

   displaying a second portion of said object including a list of items 
each corresponding to one of said first portions and one of said

   selecting one of said items via a predefined user input operation; 

and 
   displaying, in response to said selection of one of said items, an
