<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and an accompanying method, for use 
in illustratively a photographic camera for selecting 

shutter speed and lens aperture values to provide a given 
exposure level in a captured image, e.g. a photograph, of 

a scene. specifically, first an appropriate shutter 
speed value is initially selected as that which 

sufficiently reduces image blur attributable to camera 
shake. The shutter speed selection is based upon lens 

focal length and, where appropriate, camera shake data 
obtained through either accessing stored camera shake 

data or measuring actual real-time shake data. Once the 
shutter speed has been selected, then the lens aperture 

value is initially chosen as that, which in conjunction 
with the selected shutter speed, provides a baseline, 

typically an ISO normal, exposure of the scene, If the 
chosen lens aperture provides a greater depth-of-field 

than that required by the scene, i.e., as defined by the 
location of primary and background subjects relative to 

the camera, then the lens aperture value is changed from 
its initially selected value to a new value that provides 

a depth-of-field which approximately matches the scene 
requirement. The shutter speed is then increas
ed from 
its initially chosen value to a new value that, in 

conjunction with the changed lens aperture value, will 
still yield the baseline exposure and also advantageously 

provide additional compensation against camera shake.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus, and 
various accompanying methods, for use in a photographic 
camera for improving the overall quality of photographed 
images, i.e. increasing the number of acceptable and 
higher quality images, that are produced by the camera. 
The quality improvement is attained by automatically 
selecting the values of various photographic exposure 
parameters (exposure settings and, where appropriate, 
flash parameters) based upon scene requirements 
(including providing sufficient depth-of-field and 
avoiding image blur) and film quality characteristics, 
and, where appropriate, deviating from the corresponding 
exposure values dictated by adherence to the ISO/ANSI 
exposure standards. Photographic cameras have been in widespread 
use for quite some time. Basically, such a camera 
operates by exposing a portion of a light sensitive 
media, i.e. a frame of film, for a pre-defined period of 
time to scene illumination. The light is focused on the 
frame through a lens that has an aperture of a given, 
often variable, size. A shutter, situated behind the lens 
and in front of the film, opens for a selected period of 
time in order to permit the light to transit 
therethrough, illuminate and expose the film. As a 
result of being properly exposed and subsequently 
developed, the film undergoes a photochemical process, on 
a two-dimensional basis throughout the frame, that  
 
locally varies the optical transmissivity of each portion 
of the frame in proportion to the amount of illumination 
that reaches that portion of the frame from a 
corresponding portion of the scene, thereby producing, 
depending upon whether reversal or negative film is used, 
either a two-dimensional positive or negative optical 
image of the scene. As such, tonal variations that 
appeared in the scene are captured in the frame of the 
film. Photographic prints are often made from negatives, 
while transparencies (commonly referred to as "slides") 
are made from positives. Though this overall process, which relies on 
the use of silver halide as a photosensitive reagent in 
film, has basically remained unchanged over many years, 
this process is highly non-linear and subject to a great 
many variables which significantly complicate its use. 
In particular, exposure (E) is defined, under a 
standardized definition, as being a product of the 
illuminance (I) multiplied by the time (t) during which 
the film is exposed to this illumination. In this 
regard, see specifically ANSI (American National 
Standards
