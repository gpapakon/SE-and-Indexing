WO-A 9310074 and WO-A 9322277
substituted arylethanolamine derivatives
with p3 adrenergic receptor agonist activity are
disclosed.The present invention is directed to compounds of the formula

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As used in formula I, and
throughout the specification, the symbols have the following meanings:
A is a bond, -(CH2)n- or -CH(B)-, where n is an integer of 1
to 3 and B is -CN, -CON(R9)R9' or -CO2R7;R1 is lower alkyl, aryl or arylalkyl;R3 is hydrogen, alkyl, heterocycle or
R4 is hydrogen, alkyl or B;R5, R5', R8, R8' and R8'' are independently hydrogen,
alkoxy, lower alkyl, halogen, -OH, -CN, -(CH2)nNR6COR7,
-CON(R6)R6', -CON(R6)OR6', CO2R6, -SR7, -SOR7, -SO2R7,
-N(R6)SO2R1, -N(R6)R6 -NR6COR7, -OCH2CON(R6)R6', 
-OCH2CO2R7 or aryl; or R5 and R5' or R8 and R8' may together with the
carbon atoms to which they are attached form an aryl or heterocycle;R6 and R6' are independently hydrogen or lower alkyl;R7 is lower alkyl; andR9 and R9' are independently hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl,
arylalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl; or R9 and R9' may together with the nitrogen
atom to which they are attached form a heterocycle; with the proviso that
when A is a bond or -(CH2)n and R3 is hydrogen or unsubstituted alkyl,
then R4 is B or substituted alkyl.The compounds of formula I possess activity at the beta 3
adrenergic receptor in mammals and are useful in the treatment of
diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal diseases and achalasia.The present invention provides for compounds of formula I,
pharmaceutical compositions employing such compounds and for methods
of using such compounds. Listed below are definitions of various terms
used to describe the compounds of the instant invention. These definitions
apply to the terms as they are used throughout the specification (unless
they are otherwise limited in specific instances) either individually or as
part of a larger group.The terms "alk" or "alkyl" refers to both straight and branched
chain groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 8 carbons. It is
understood, therefore, that the terms "alk" and "alkyl" denote both
unsubstituted groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl,
iso-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, 1-methylbutyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl,
2-methylpentyl, n-hexyl and the like as well as substituted groups. The
term "substituted alkyl" specifically denotes an alkyl group as defined
above having one or more of the following substituents: halo (especially to
form trihaloalkyl,
