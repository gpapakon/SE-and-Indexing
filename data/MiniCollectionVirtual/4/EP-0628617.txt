<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silicone
pressure-sensitive adhesive composition which has a hot melt
adhesive that cures upon exposure to ambient moisture.Silicone pressure-sensitive adhesives
(hereinafter PSAs) typically contain at least two primary
components, namely a linear siloxane polymer and a tackifier
resin comprising triorganosiloxane (M) units (i.e., R3SiO1/2
units, in which R denotes a monovalent organic group) and
silicate (Q) units (i.e., SiO4/2 units). In addition,
silicone PSA compositions are generally provided with some
crosslinking means (e.g., peroxide or hydrosilation cure
systems) in order to optimize various properties of the
final adhesive product. In view of the high viscosity
imparted by the polymer component, these PSA compositions
are typically dispersed in an organic solvent for ease of
application.The prior art in this technical field is
represented by the following: US-A 4,143,088; US-A
4,865,920; US-A 5,091,484; US-A 5,162,410; Ep-A1 0 529 841
and JP-A 4/81487.With the current emphasis on the control of
volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, the use of
conventional PSAs is losing favor and there is an ever
growing need for PSAs which contain little or no solvent.
Furthermore, many applications require that an essentially
instant bond be formed between parts so that the parts can
be transported or otherwise manipulated without waiting for
a solvent to evaporate or the composition to cure. This
characteristic is defined herein as "green strength" and is
manifested by high initial adhesive strength of the PSA. These needs are addressed by the PSA compositions
of the present invention, which have a high level of instant
tack and green strength while being essentially solvent-free.
Additionally, these systems are non-slump solids
under ambient conditions but can be heated to a flowable
liquid and applied to substrates by methods now employed to
dispense hot melt organic adhesives. Further, our PSAs,
which can be stored as one-part systems for extended
periods, cure to essentially non-tacky elastomers when
exposed to moisture and provide an even stronger bond than
its corresponding green strength value. Unlike compositions
which remain PSAs after cure, the cured compositions of the
present invention can be handled after curing and exhibit
limited dirt pick-up and contamination when an excess of the
material overflows the intended bond area. Such
contamination is undesirable from an aesthetic perspective
as well as from performance considerations in electronic
application
