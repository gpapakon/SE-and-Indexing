<ABSTRACT>
In the operation of construction machinery, it is often desirable to be able to utilize a variety of implements on a single machine. While it is extremely important to be able to attach and detach these implements very quickly, many mechanisms suffer trade-offs in a variety of design parameters. The coupling device of the subject invention utilizes a locking arrangement (58) that provides a positive coupling force upon initial engagement of the device and maintains the positive force throughout the entire operation of each work implement (12). All of the components in the coupling device are maintained in linear alignment with the mounting components of the machine linkage to reduce the magnitude of operational forces transmitted therebetween and to provide a device that is extremely compact and versatile in design.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionA COUPLING DEVICE FOR A WORK IMPLEMENTTechnical FieldThis invention relates to a coupling device and more particularly to a coupling device that is utilized to quickly couple and uncouple a variety of work implements to a linkage arrangement of a work vehicle.Background ArtIn the operation of construction equipment in recent years there has been a growing trend to utilize machines originally intended for a rather specific task in much more varied applications. In order to accomplish this, coupling mechanisms have been developed to allow a vehicle to mount and utilize more than one implement. For example, in the operation of a hydraulic excavator, an operator may encounter various types of soil on a single job site. When this happens, it is often necessary to change from one bucket to another or, in situations wherein rocky conditions are encountered, an entirely different implement, such as a powered hammer, may be required. In each of these situations, it is desirable to be able to detach one tool and attach the next tool and return the machine to a productive task as quickly as possible. Several different types of quick coupling mechanisms have been utilized with varying degrees of success. One design that has achieved a great deal of success is disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,854,813, issued to Robert L. Degeeter et al. on Aug. 8, 1989. This design utilizes a wedge arrangement to couple the mounting plates of a work implement to the linkage 

arrangement of a work vehicle. While the wedges are arranged in linear alignment with the mounting plates and portions of the linkage arrangements, the wedges must be driven into place by means of a hammer or other suitable tool that does not maintain a positive force against the wedges while the wedges are being secured in place. This force has been known to vary somewhat and in some instances, the connection between the work implement and the linkage arrangement will loosen slightly. While this loosening is not sufficient to cause the uncoupling of the work implement, it is often necessary to re-attach the wedges to prevent their accelerated wear.Another coupling is disclosed in U. S. Patent 5,147,173, issued to Raymond L. Fauber et al. on September 15, 1992. This patent also discloses the use of a wedge to couple a linkage arrangement to a work implement. The wedge member is driven into engagement with a hydraulic actuator to maintain a positive connection at all times and has been known to work quite well. Due to the limited space that is available

Claims
1. A coupling device adapted for securing a linkage arrangement (10) having at least one connecting link (14) that is engageable with at least one mounting plate (46) defined by a work implement (12) in linear alignment therewith, said coupling device comprising: a locking member (66) mounted to the respective connecting link (14) in linear alignment therewith, said locking member (66) being moveable between a first position wherein the locking member (66) is engaged with the respective mounting plate (46) to secure the connecting link (14) thereto and a second position wherein the locking member (66) is disengaged from the mounting plate (46) to allow movement of the connecting link (14) with respect thereto; and an actuator (98) threadably engaged with the respective locking member (66) for moving said locking member (66) between its first and second positions upon rotation of said actuator (98) .
2. A coupling device as set forth in claim 1 wherein the locking member (66) is mounted for reciprocation within a housing (62) that is secured to an upper portion (60) of the connecting link (14) .

respect to the locking member (66) causes reciprocation of the locking member (66) within the housing (62) .
4. A coupling device as set forth in claim
3 wherein the first end portion (100) of the actuator defines a hexagonal portion that is sufficient for engagement with wrench.
5. A coupling device as set forth in claim
