<ABSTRACT>
The saw has an outer housing (1) providing the workbench surface (4), for supporting the workpiece with the saw unit (7) positioned beneath the workbench surface, together with its electric drive motor (8). The saw-blade (10) projects through a slot (9) in the workbench surface extending along the full length of the latter, with the saw unit displaced along linear guide rails, to move the saw-blade along the slot. The guide rails are rigidly attached to the outer housing, the saw unit mounted on a carriage which travels along them so that it can be tipped through a given angle.

A table circular saw having an external housing (1) comprising a table top (4) which forms
a workpiece support face (3), having a sawing unit (7) which comprises a drive motor (8) and

which is disposed under the table top (4) in the external housing (1), and having a circular saw
blade (10) which passes through the table top (4) from below in a sawing slit (9), wherein the

sawing slit (9) extends substantially over the entire length of the table top (4) and thus defines the
longitudinal direction of the table circular saw, wherein the sawing unit (7) is displaceable in the

longitudinal direction, by means of bearing elements (21), on guide rails (11) which run in the
longitudinal direction, whereby the circular saw blade (10) moves in the longitudinal direction in

the sawing slit (9), wherein the sawing unit (7) can also be tilted laterally to one side with respect
to a mitre cut axis which runs in the longitudinal direction and is situated in the sawing slit (9)

approximately in the plane of the workpiece support face (3), and wherein the circular saw bade
(10) is height-adjustable,
characterised in that

the guide rails (11) are fixedly mounted on the external housing (1), that the sawing unit (7) is
disposed in a cradle (15) which is displaceable on the guide rails (11) and can be tilted laterally

in the cradle (15) about the mitre cut axis, and that the sawing unit (7) has a supporting frame (34)
for the height adjustment of the circular saw blade (10), which supporting frame is mounted on

a bearing point (35) in the cradle (15) so that it can swivel about a supporting pivot (36) running
in a transverse direction.
A table circular saw according to claim 1, characterised in that the guide rails (11) are
disposed on the table top (4) and the cradle (15) is mounted suspended, and that the guide rail

(11) is preferably fixed to the table top (4) by screws (16) passing through the table top (4) from
above and the heads of the screws (16) are countersunk in the table top (4), particularly in a

recess (18) in the table top (4) which is covered by a cover (17) which terminates flush therewith, 
or preferably that the guide rail (11) is integrally formed on the table top (4), wherein the table

top (4) here optionally consists of one or more extruded sections, made of aluminium in particular,
and the guide rail (11) is part of the extruded section.
A table circular saw according to either one of the preceding claims, characterised in that
the bearing elements (21) of the cradle (15), which in particular are constructed as bearing rollers,

effectively act on one guide rail (11) in all directions but do not act on the other guide rail (11)
in the transverse direction.
A table circular saw according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the mitre
cut axis is defined as a vir
tual axis by circularly arcuate gate guides (14).
A table circular saw according to claim 4, characterised in that the cradle (15) consists of
end plates (31) and of connecting elements (32) which connect the latter and carry the bearing

elements (21), and that the end plates (31) of the cradle (15) comprise the circularly arcuate gate
guides (14) for the lateral tilting of the sawing unit (7).
A table circular saw according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that
the cradle (15) is designed as a swarf catchment box which is closed all round at the bottom, or

that a swarf catchment box (33) is suspended in the cradle (15), particularly in the gate guides
(14), so that it can be tilted with respect to the mitre cut axis, and the sawing unit (7) is disposed

in the swarf catchment box (33).
A table circular saw according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that an
adjusting spindle (44) or the like - which is independent of a pull rod (12) for the sawing unit (7)

which may possibly be present - acts on the supporting frame (34) at a distance from the bearing
point (35) and is mounted at its other end in a spindle abutment (45) on the cradle (15),

particularly on the swarf catchment box (33).
A table circular saw according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the
supporting pivot (36) of the supporting frame (34) is fixed/mounted at its pivot ends on the cradle 

(15), particularly on the swarf catchment box (33), and that the supporting pivot (36), with the
supporting frame (34) or supporting frames (34) on the supporting pivot (36), is at least slightly

adjustable axially - in the transverse direction.
A table circular saw according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the
supporting pivot (36) is slightly angularly adjustable in relation to the transverse direction, and

that one pivot end is preferably adjustable transversely to the axial direction for this purpose, and
that an eccentrically adjustable bearing is in turn preferably provided for this purpose.
A table circular saw according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that a lower
protective hood (48) and a gap gusset (49) mounted thereon are associated with the circular saw

blade (10), and that the protective hood (48) is firstly mounted on the supporting frame (34) so
that it can rotate about the drive shaft of the circular saw blade (10) and is secondly joined to the

cradle (15), particularly to the swarf catchment box (33), via a parallel guide rod (50), and that
the protective hood (48) is preferably at least slightly adjustable in a transverse direction in

relation to the circular saw blade (10), wherein the transverse adjustment of the protective hood
(48) in relation to the circular saw blade (10) is optionally effected by means of an adjusting

connection (52) which acts in a sliding manner on an arcuate gate guide (51) of the supporting
frame (34).
A table circular saw according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that
guard flaps (54, 55), which run in the longitudinal direction, just above and near the table top (4)

and at the side of the sawing unit (7), are coupled to the cradle (15) so that they can swivel, which
guard flaps prevent lateral intervention in the sawing unit (7) and follow each lateral tilting

movement of the sawing unit (7).
A table circular saw according to any one of claims 1 to 11, having an external housing
(1) which comprises, as structural elements apart from a table top (4) which ensure torsional

rigidity, two plate-like side cheeks (5) and at least two transverse rods (6) connecting the side
cheeks (5) at the bottom, characterised in that the transverse rods (6) are provided at their ends 

with external denticulations and are held by internal denticulations in insertion sockets (68) in the
side cheeks (5).
