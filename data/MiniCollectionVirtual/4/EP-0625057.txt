<ABSTRACT>
A blood oxygenator/heat exchanger system (10) includes disposable and durable components, the latter being possible of permanent installation to further reduce costs, inconvenience and risks of use. The system may selectively include a blood pump (136) of axial, centrifugal, or ventricular type, along with an integral venous reservoir (206). By combination, arrangement and cooperation of structural features blood pumping volume is decreased, advantageous blood flow paths are achieved, blood damage is reduced, and durable components are reusable for lowest costs. The oxygenator/heat exchanger (58) nests upon a durable heat source base (24) to be supported thereby, while redundant boundaries are provided between blood and heat transfer media.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blood oxygenator and
temperature control apparatus. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a blood oxygenator forming a disposable
component of a heat exchanger having as its other component a
durable heat source member. The two components are unitable in
heat exchange relation. Alternatively, the blood oxygenator
may also include any one or all of a blood pump, venous
reservoir or auxiliary heat exchange component.Extracorporeal blood oxygenation systems are well known for
pumping and/or oxygenating a patient's blood during
cardiovascular surgery or other procedures. The blood
oxygenation system replaces or supplements the normal
physiological lung function of replacing the carbon dioxide in
venous blood with oxygen for the arterial blood system. The
blood oxygenator typically includes a venous reservoir, a heat
exchanger, a blood pump and a blood oxygenator. The venous
reservoir provides a supply of venous blood to be oxygenated,
the heat exchanger maintains the blood temperature at the
"normal thermic" temperature or at a sub-normal temperature,
depending on the procedure, the blood pump provides blood
transport from the venous reservoir (or other source such as
venous blood tubing) to an oxygenator input, through the
oxygenator and to the output for return to the patient, and the
oxygenator provides a suitable membrane for exchange of carbon
dioxide for oxygen.Some prior blood oxygenation systems, such as that described
by Bringham et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,698,207, integrated
several of the major components of the blood oxygenation
system, namely the venous reservoir, the heat exchanger and the 
oxygenator. Such an integrated system, while permitting
placement close to the patient may still require a substantial
volume of priming blood or fluid. Of course, the prior
oxygenator systems with separate blood pump and connecting
conduits required even more priming blood or fluid volume.
Furthermore, the increase in blood volume within the
extracorporeal circuit undesirably increases the volume of
blood and/or blood products which must be administered by
transfusion during the procedure. A large priming volume
increases the amount of non-physiologic matter with which the
blood contacts as the blood travels through the blood
oxygenation system, thereby increasing the potential for
mechanical, chemical and/or immunoreactive damage to the blood.
Non-blood priming solutions also cause hematocrit dilution. A
large priming volume increases blood-wetted surface
