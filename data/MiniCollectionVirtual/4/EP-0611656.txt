<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink
refilling container for refilling an ink container
with ink and ink refilling method using the ink
refilling container. More particularly it relates to
the ink refilling container for refilling with the ink
an ink containing portion of an ink jet cartridge
unified with a recording head to be detachably mounted
on an ink jet recording apparatus, and an ink
refilling method using the ink refilling container.A widely used type of ink jet recording
machines, an ink jet unit of a cartridge type having
integral recording head and an ink container, the ink
container containing ink in an ink absorbing material
therein to supply the ink to the recording head. The
ink jet recording head is detachably mountable on a
carriage which scans the recording material. The ink
Jet unit is replaced with a fresh ink jet unit when
the ink in the ink container is used up.However, the service life of the recording
head is longer than the quantity of the ink contained
in the ink container in the ink jet unit, and
therefore, even if the ink of the ink jet unit is used
up. The recording head may still be usable. 
Disposing of such an ink jet unit is not preferable
from the standpoint of natural resources and
environmental conditions.Accordingly, refilling of the ink container
for such an ink jet unit with ink has been proposed.
Graphic utilities has proposed that an injection
needle of metal is mounted to an ink container in the
form of bellows. An ink container is pierced, and the
needle is inserted through the pierce, and thereafter,
the bellows of the ink container is manually collapsed
gradually to pressure the ink into the container. The
ink container may be in the form of an injector to
press the ink into the container.In such an ink refilling system, the needle
member is used, and there is a liable that human body
is damaged. If the ink is too much pressurized, the
ink is discharged at a speed higher than the ink
seeping speed with the result that the ink overflows
through the pierce. In order to refilled ink without
the overflowing, the pressurized state is maintained
at a predetermined condition. The mechanism for the
maintenance will be complicated. Because the
operators manipulation is required throughout the ink
refilling period because of the necessity for
maintaining the pressurized state, the operator is
confined to the refilling operation for a long period
of time. In the bellow type or injector type 
container, the flow resistance is small before the
needle is inserted into

<CLAIMS>
An ink refilling container (R1; R2; R3; R4) comprising:

an ink containing portion (1; 21) for containing an ink (3)
to refill,
an ink injection tube (6; 26) for connection with said ink
containing portion (1; 21),
an ink (3) for refilling, and
an air vent (4; 24), provided in said ink refilling
container (R1, R2; R3; R4), for communication with ambience,
characterized by
an openable member (5; 25) for closing said air vent (4;
24),

wherein
a meniscus (32) of ink (3) is formed adjacent an end of
said injection tube (6; 26), and
the ink (3) is not leaked externally as long as said air
vent (4; 24) is closed.
A container according to claim 1, wherein an inside diameter
of said ink injection tube (6; 26) is 1 - 3 mm.
A container according to claim 1, wherein a capping member
(29) is provided at an end of said ink injection tube (6; 26). 
A container according to claim 1, wherein said ink containing
portion (1; 21) comprises a container body and a cover (2; 22),

and the cover (2; 22) has elasticy.
A container according to claim 3, wherein said ink injection
tube (6; 26) is deviated in one direction relative to the

capping member (29).
A combination comprising an ink container (R1; R2; R3; R4)
according to claim 1 and an adopter (AD).
An ink refilling method in which an ink (3) is refilled into
an ink jet cartridge (IJC) having a recording head (12) and an

ink container (11; 41) having therein an ink absorbing material
(13) for absorbing the ink (3) to be supplied to the recording

head (12) comprising the steps of
