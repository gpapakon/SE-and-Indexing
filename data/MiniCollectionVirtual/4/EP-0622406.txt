<ABSTRACT>
A silicone rubber composition comprising 
(1) a diorganopolysiloxane blocked with a 

hydroxysilyl group at either end, (2) a silane 
or siloxane having at least three hydrolyzable 

silyl groups in a molecule, and (3) a divalent 
organic tin compound in a form substantially 

isolated from air quickly cures into a silicone 
rubber elastomer simply by heating at 40 to 

200°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silicone rubber
compositions curable to silicone rubber elastomers having
rubbery properties.Prior art room temperature vulcanizable
(RTV) silicone rubber compositions of the
condensation type are generally based on a
diorganopolysiloxane end-blocked with a
hydrolyzable silyl group or based on a
diorganopolysiloxane blocked with a hydroxysilyl
group at either end and a silane or siloxane
having at least three hydrolyzable silyl groups
in a molecule. They are cured with the aid of
curing catalysts such as tetravalent organic tin
compounds and organic titanium compounds.The silicone rubber
compositions based on a diorganopolysiloxane
end-blocked with a hydrolyzable silyl group do 
not cure without water or humidity and are not
susceptible to curing-promotion by heating. It is
difficult to cure these compositions within a
short time. The latter silicone rubber
compositions based on a diorganopolysiloxane
blocked with a hydroxysilyl group at either end
and a silane or siloxane having at least three
hydrolyzable silyl groups in a molecule cure
fast and are less affected by water as compared
with the former compositions. However, water
supply is indispensable in order to allow
heavy-gage moldings of these compositions to
cure deep inside. To this end, water,
alcohol or the like is added to the
compositions. Even when such a technique is
employed, large sized moldings require an
undesirably long time until curing is completed.One known heat curing type of liquid
silicone rubber composition is a composition of
the addition curing type relying on hydroxysilylation
reaction. The liquid silicone rubber
compositions of heat curing type are advantageous
in that the curing rate is increased by
heating and the pot life is readily adjustable,
but have a disadvantage associated with the use 
of platinum series compounds as the catalyst. When
contacted with compounds having an ability to coordinate
with a platinum series metal, for example, compounds or
materials containing sulphur, amine or tin, the
compositions are inhibited from curing by catalyst
poisoning. Therefore, the compositions are applicable
only under very carefully controlled conditions.When a diorganopolysiloxane blocked with a
hydroxysilyl group at either end, a silane or siloxane
having at least three hydrolysable silyl groups in a
molecule, and a divalent organic tin compound, in a form
substantially isolated from air, are blended one can
obtain a silicone rubber composition which upon heating
is quickly curable into a silicone
