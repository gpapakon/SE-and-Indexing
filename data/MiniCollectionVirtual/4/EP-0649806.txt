<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for loading a roll of web 
(1) from a stack (3) along a first axis (7) into a 

chamber (2) along the second axis (8) has a pivotable 
support member (12) and an engaging means (16) having a 

head member (18) attached to the support member (12) 
for engaging a roll along the first axis (7) and 

guiding the roll (1) into the chamber (4) along the 
second (8). The support member (12) pivots between a 

first position in alignment with the stack (3) along 
the first axis (7) and, a second position in alignment 

with the chamber opening (4) along the second axis (8). 
A guide means (22) characterized in that a guide track 

(24) having first and second elevation positions and 
predetermined first, second and third stopping means 

(30), (53), (44) are provided to ensure that the 
engaging means (16) precisely and repeatedly locates at 

the desired positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus and
method for loading objects into containers. More
particularly, the invention concerns an apparatus and
method for loading rolls of photographic web from a
stack into a chamber within a container for
photographic web.Packages or containers that provide
photographic web to photofinishing equipment must be
periodically loaded with photographic web either by the
photofinisher or by the photographic web manufacturer.
Conventional apparatus and methods for loading rolls of
web, such as photographic paper, into chambers within
packages or containers operate in tandem with the
manufacturer's web slitter operation. In this
operation, once the web is slit it exits the slitter
operation having a horizontal orientation. The slit
web, while horizontal, is transferred to a "gin pole"
or shaft and the "gin pole" is lowered to a height that
corresponds to the height of the chamber opening. The
slit webs are then pushed from the "gin pole" into the
chamber. Thus, existing apparatus is designed to load
photographic paper into chambers from the
manufacturer's slitter operation and at a
photofinisher's location.One shortcoming of the present apparatus for
loading packaging chambers, such as the packaging
described in US-A-5,383,591,
is that
the package could not be conveniently loaded by the
photofinishers. Instead, because existing apparatus 
for loading photographic paper is rather
cumbersome, the photofinisher has to return the
package chamber, once the paper supply is
exhausted, to the photographic paper manufacturer
for reloading. This practice, of course, results in
undesirable photofinishing equipment and processing
downtime, excessive shipping cost accruing to both
the manufacturer and the photofinisher, and the
additional cost to the photofinisher for the
convenience of preloaded packages.One prior art apparatus for loading a
package container known to the inventors is
described in US-A-5,390,872.
Generally the apparatus
includes a roll support shaft that is preloaded
with rolls of web via a hoist and the entire affair
is then inserted into the package chamber which
interfaces with photofinishing equipment. While
this apparatus works well for the top loaded
package container described in the application, it
would not be suited for a variety of package
chamber configurations as the present invention.
Moreover, the apparatus described in the
application requires considerably more labor
support to operate and, it is far more expensive to
manufacture. US-A-4,441,662 discloses

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (l0) for loading an object (1)
including a central opening (5 with an interior wall (9), comprising a fixed frame member

(14) having a reference axis; a stack (3) containing said object (1) being spaced
from said frame (14), said stack having a first axis (7); said apparatus (10)

being 
characterized by:
a chamber (4) arranged about the frame (14) for receiving said object (1),
said chamber having a second axis (8) transverse to said first axis (7) of said

stack (3);
a support member (12) pivotably mounted to said frame member (14) for
rotation about said reference axis between a first

elevational position above the stack (3), and a
second elevational position in alignment

with the chamber (4) opening;
a head support member (50) mounted to said support member (12), said
head support member (50) having a head member (18) mounted thereon;
means for guiding (22) said head support member (50), said means for
guiding (22) comprising a guide track (24), said guide track (24) defining a first

elevational position along said first axis (7) and a second elevational position
along said second axis (8);
engaging means (16) rotatably mounted to said head member (18) for firmly
engaging the object (1) along said first axis (7) and delivering the object (1) along

said second axis (8) into the chamber (4); and
means (19) mounted to said support member (12) for raising
and lowering said head

member (18) between said first and second positions.
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 1 further characterized by a first
stopping means (30) provided for limiting the elevation of the support member

(12) when the head member (18) is in alignment with the first
axis (7) of the stack (3). 
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 2 further characterized by a second
stopping means (53) provided for precisely and repeatedly locating said head

member (18) relative to said central opening (5) of said object (1).
The apparatus (10) recited in claim 3 further characterized by a third
stopping means (44) provided for precisely and repeatedly locating said support

member (12) when the head member (18) is in alignment with the in said second
axis (8) of the chamber (4).
The apparatus (10) recited in Claim l, further characterized by a slide
(54) mounted to said head support member (5), said engaging means (16) being

supported by said slide (54).
