<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an ingot arrangement (1) in a continuous casting installation, comprising an ingot mould (2A) and an oscillating holding device (4) used for causing said ingot mould to swing when in a casting position (2a). The ingot arrangement consists, in a separable manner, of an interchangeable part (2a) and a stationary part (4, 11, 12, 12', 71). To replace the interchangeable part, it is separated from the stationary one and moved using a conveying means (23), at least along a partial path, from its position of operation into an area (29) beneath the casting position (2a). This enables, especially in multiline casting installations, the interchangeable part to be transported during the casting process and, for example, along paths comprising straight (23') or arciform segments (23''), to any purposefully selected position (2b) and to be replaced by a new interchangeable part by reversing the steps of the method. Such a method allows for an interchangeable part to be replaced in multiline installations with no interference with the casting process in any adjacent ingot arrangement.

70) and a replaceable part (2a, 2', 2", 2"', 2""),

the replaceable part being separably connected with
the stationary part and the replaceable part

comprising at least one component of the mould;
b) a device for exchanging the replaceable part, which
comprises a conveying device (22, 23, 38, 56, 69)

for conveying the replaceable part between an
operating position (2a) and a second position (2b)

in a space (29) below the casting position (2a),
characterised in that
c) the stationary part comprises the holding device
(4) and
d) the holding device and the replaceable part are so
constructed that the replaceable part may be moved

by means of the conveying device out of the
operating position (2a) into the second position

(2b) after separation from the stationary part (4).
A continuous casting installation according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the replaceable part comprises a
mould cavity wall (40, 60) which forms a mould cavity

(3) of the mould (2"', 2"") with a pouring opening and
an outlet opening for a strand (3'). 
A continuous casting installation according to claim 2,

characterised in that
 the replaceable part includes a
coolant channel (32, 49) surrounding the mould cavity

wall (9) for cooling the mould cavity wall.
A continuous casting installation according to any one
of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the replaceable
part comprises the mould (2a, 2', 2").
A continuous casting installation according to either
one of claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 the
replaceable part (2") comprises foot rollers (35) and/or

spray cooling devices (36) and/or an electromagnetic
agitator (34) for the strand (31) at the outlet opening.
A continuous casting installation according to any one
of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the stationary
part (11) comprises a device (50, 51) for

electromagnetic agitation and/or braking of molten metal
in the mould cavity (3) and/or in the strand (31) and/or

a spray cooling device for the strand (31) and/or
measuring apparatuses for monitoring the casting

operation, especially for measuring the level of the
meniscus (12, 12') and/or for monitoring the temperature

(71) of parts of the mould.
A continuous casting installation according to any one
of claims 2 or 5 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the
stationary part comprises a spray cooling device (62,

63) for cooling the mould cavity wall (60).
A continuous casting installation according to any one
of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the stationary
part comprises at least one supply connection (15, 16,

71) and the replaceable part is constructed in such a 
way that the supply connection is coupled to or

uncoupled from a corresponding supply connection (15',
16', 70) of the replaceable part during exchange of the

replaceable part, in order to effect or undo a supply
connection.
A continuous casting installation according to claim 8,

characterised in that
 the supply connection is formed
for the purpose of supplying energy (70, 71), coolants

(15", 16"), lubricants (21, 66) or signals (70, 71).
A continuous casting installation according to any one
