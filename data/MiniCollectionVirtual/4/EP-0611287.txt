<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to heart monitors 
and more particularly to heart monitors of the 
portable type. One example of a portable heart monitor of 
the type herein contemplated is disclosed in 
commonly assigned U. S. Patent 3,938,507. The 
monitor of the '507 patent is provided with a pair 
of electrodes which are configured so as to be 
conveniently and comfortably held within the armpits 
of a user in accordance with the teachings of U. S. 
Patent 3,792,700. The preferred use of the device 
is in the method disclosed in U. S. Patents 
3,910,260, 4,004,577, and 4,658,830. As disclosed 
in the aforesaid patents, heart monitors may be used 
in conjunction with medicaments contained within 
auto-injectors for enabling a designated coronary-prone 
individual to self-administer arrhythmia and 
thrombolytic treatment drugs during the early 
minutes or hours of the onset of heart attack 
symptoms at a time before the individual can be 
hospitalized or reached by an ambulance crew. For 
this use, it is important that the monitor be 
capable of simple, but effective, connection with 
the user so as to acquire the electrical activity of 
the heart of the user in a form capable of 
transmission over a telephone line to a central 
source where sufficient intelligence is provided for 
aiding the individual in undertaking the self-administered 
treatment.  
 Portable heart monitors are also utilized 
as portable diagnostic tools. Typically, a portable 
heart monitor could be used by paramedics. In 
addition, such portable monitors are quite useful in 
physician house calls. Moreover, portable monitors 
can have many uses in hospitals as well. A limitation on the two-electrode monitor 
disclosed in the aforesaid '507 patent is that it is 
capable essentially of providing only one lead out 
of the twelve leads which are conventionally 
provided by non-portable in hospital ECG machines, 
see, for example, U. S. Patent 3,058,458. There 
nave been attempts to build into portable monitoring 
devices the capability of monitoring more than one 
lead. For example, in commonly assigned U. S. 
Patent 4,862,896, the two-electrode unit or the '507 
patent was made adaptable to provide more than one 
lead by securing the electrodes in predetermined 
positions within the exterior of the monitor housing 
so as to achieve an additional modified precordial 
lead. Furthermore in commonly assigned U. S. Patent 
4,889,134, there is disclosed a portable heart 
monitor which embodies three electrodes so as to 
enable the user to obtain
